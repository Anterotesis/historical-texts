            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My deareſt and moſt honoured Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Am not a Perſon who ever
had any <hi>deſign on Patrons,</hi> and
am therefore little uſed to this
Ceremony of <hi>Dedications,</hi> being
withall ſenſible how inſignificant
it is in many <hi>other regards.</hi> But I
cannot ſatisfie my ſelf if I ſhould
omit this occaſion of a Publick Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
of thoſe many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
I have received from <hi>your
Lordſhip,</hi> ever ſince I had the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
to be <hi>perſonally</hi> known unto
you. I will not trouble you with
an Enumeration of the Particulars,
I know you had rather <hi>do</hi> them
<pb facs="tcp:56909:3"/>
than <hi>hear</hi> of them. But I have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
peculiar Reaſons for this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs:
The <hi>Poſſibility of Diſcipline in
a Dioceſan Juriſdiction</hi> is a Subject
nearly concerning <hi>your Lordſhip</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your new Promotion, and I
hope <hi>your Lordſhip</hi> will let Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
ſee from your own <hi>experience,</hi>
that it is as practicable in a <hi>Dioceſe,</hi>
as in his <hi>Worceſterſhire Aſſociation.</hi>
He allows no <hi>preeminence</hi> of one
<hi>Miniſter</hi> above others, in order to
the <hi>forming ſuch Aſſociations</hi> for great
and generous deſigns, but what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults
from the difference of <hi>Talents.</hi>
But certainly where, beſides this
<hi>preeminence in Talents,</hi> there is alſo a
<hi>preeminence in Office</hi> too; where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
theſe <hi>gifts and qualifications</hi> of a
Perſon to <hi>perſuade</hi> his Brethren,
there is alſo an antecedent <hi>obligation</hi>
incumbent on them to hearken to
his <hi>perſuaſions,</hi> it cannot chooſe but
add conſiderably to the <hi>efficacy</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:56909:3"/>
ſuch his <hi>perſuaſions,</hi> both to <hi>engage</hi>
them at firſt, and to <hi>hold them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
when they are once engaged.
This <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> therefore I hope for
from <hi>your Lordſhip,</hi> that you will
help me to convince him from his
<hi>own Topick of Experience,</hi> and that you
will give him an <hi>experiment</hi> of his
own Age and Country, that he
may not ſtill complain of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to Ancient and Forein Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents.</p>
            <p>Beſides, you have given me
hopes of an aſſiſtance in the <hi>Diſpute</hi>

concerning the <hi>Ancient Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment

Queſt.</hi> 2. waved by me. <hi>§</hi> 2. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s
<hi>reaſons</hi> do as ſolidly diſprove a <hi>poſſibility
of Secular Diſcipline</hi> under a <hi>Secular Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,</hi>
of a Precinct as <hi>large</hi> as a <hi>Dioceſe,</hi>
as of <hi>Dioceſan Diſcipline. § 3. Secular
Monarchs</hi> as well <hi>reſponſible</hi> for the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage
of <hi>particular Subjects</hi> as <hi>Biſhops,</hi>
and their <hi>charge</hi> is as <hi>great.</hi> The <hi>Perſons,
Crimes,</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi> belonging to the care of
the <hi>Secular Governour</hi> more <hi>numerous</hi>
than they which belong to the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical.
§</hi> 4, 5. So are the <hi>neceſſities</hi> to be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for by the <hi>Secular Governour. §</hi> 6, 7, 8.
<pb facs="tcp:56909:6"/>
An <hi>Objection</hi> prevented. <hi>§</hi> 9. Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s
firſt <hi>anſwer</hi> refuted. The <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of a <hi>Dioceſe</hi> may be adminiſtred with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any more than <hi>three Orders. §</hi> 10. The
<hi>Church</hi> may for prudential reaſons conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute

Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s ſecond <hi>anſwer</hi> refuted. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal

fifth <hi>anſwers</hi> refuted. <hi>§</hi> 14, 15. His ſixth

I make the <hi>decretory power of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
proper to the <hi>Supreme,</hi> and the <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive</hi>
onely to be communicated to <hi>inferiour
Governours. §</hi> 17. The <hi>decretory pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Government</hi> does not neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<hi>perſonal or particular Exploration.
§</hi> 18, 19. His ſeventh <hi>anſwer</hi> conſidered.
<hi>Good men</hi> need <hi>Government</hi> as well as
others. Their <hi>miſtakes</hi> more <hi>dangerous
to Government</hi> than the <hi>miſtakes of
others. §</hi> 20. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Objection in
favour of me. His firſt <hi>anſwer</hi> refuted.
<hi>§</hi> 21. His ſecond <hi>anſwer</hi> refuted. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration</hi>
is no act of <hi>power. §</hi> 22. The
<hi>unbecomingneſs</hi> of Doctrines, ſo <hi>diſpara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
to Eccleſiaſtical Authority,</hi> to Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> as a <hi>Curer of Church-diviſions.
§</hi> 23. The firſt <hi>Reformers</hi> at length ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb facs="tcp:56909:7"/>
of the neceſſity of <hi>Church Authority
to Peace and Diſcipline. §</hi> 24. Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s
uncandid character of a <hi>Prelatick
Chriſtian. §</hi> 25. The uſe of <hi>external
coercion in Religion</hi> is not to make men
onely <hi>diſſemblers. §</hi> 26, 27, 28. No <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi>
to be expected without a <hi>coercive
power</hi> ſomewhere. <hi>§</hi> 29. The <hi>liberty</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> inconſiſtent with the
<hi>Principles</hi> of the <hi>Ignatian Epiſcopacy,</hi> ſo

<hi>§</hi> 30. Inconſiſtent with the <hi>diſcipline</hi>
of the <hi>Church</hi> deſcribed by <hi>Tertullian</hi> and
<hi>Firmilian. §</hi> 31. Inconſiſtent with that of

§</hi> 32. My ſecond Argument for
the <hi>Poſſibility of Dioceſan Diſcipline</hi>

§</hi> 33. The notion of a <hi>Church</hi> for no more
than are capable of <hi>perſonal</hi> inſpection of a
ſingle <hi>Presbyter,</hi> not proved to be of <hi>Divine
Inſtitution</hi> from <hi>Acts 14. 23. §</hi> 34, 35. His
ſecond and third <hi>anſwer</hi> refuted. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution
of <hi>particular Cures to particular
Presbyters,</hi> (from whence it comes to paſs,
that <hi>one Dioceſe</hi> includes <hi>many ſuch Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
as are fitted for <hi>perſonal Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>)
is more <hi>convenient</hi> than their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:56909:7"/>

probably as <hi>ancient</hi> as they had <hi>ſettled places

that had <hi>ſingle Biſhops</hi> more generally as

Why I am unwilling to <hi>recriminate. §</hi> 3.
An account of the <hi>Publication</hi> of theſe

cannot in reaſon be called a <hi>Confutation,</hi>
as the word <hi>Confutation</hi> ſignifies either

Not proving them <hi>falſe,</hi> the <hi>unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>

Their <hi>Similitudes</hi> will not do

1. That at leaſt it muſt be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

By this it appears how little reaſon I had to <hi>depend</hi> on him. However I am glad he has acquainted the Reader with the true <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> of theſe diſingenuous Suſpicions concerning me, that he has referr'd him to my <hi>Books.</hi> He cannot mean my <hi>two Books</hi> deſignodly againſt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts,</hi> but onely the laſt of <hi>Schiſm.</hi> Vpon which the Controverſie will be reduced to this ſhort iſſue; They who will have the defence of <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Authority</hi> to paſs for <hi>Popery</hi> will judge me a <hi>Papiſt;</hi> but they who will take the eſtimate of <hi>Popery</hi> from what the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Church of England</hi> has condemned under that name, will find no ſhadow for ſo baſe an Accuſation. I am heartily content to abide this tryal; but Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had deale more ſincerely, if he (who is, on other occaſions where there is no need, ſo offended at others for not explaining terms not understood by the parties in different ſenſes) had been here as careful to warn his Reader, that this was all he meant by the name of <hi>Popery.</hi> He cannot but know, that the <hi>Commonalty,</hi> to whom he would make me odious by this inſinuation, mean far different and worſe things by it, than the bare defence of <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Authority</hi> free from any of the <hi>Romiſh Encroachments</hi> and <hi>Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations.</hi>

is for the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> to aſperſe that
<hi>ſame Religion,</hi> which has been ſettled
here by thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Legiſlators,</hi> who
firſt excluded <hi>Popery,</hi> with that ſame odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Name, againſt which thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> and

We know how very <hi>lately</hi> they have
again been endeavouring it, and even at

I know particularly how Mr.

What difference is there betwixt
that which was decried as <hi>Grotianiſm</hi> in

And not now to enter into the particular

HAS he therefore proved what is
ſaid in <hi>defence</hi> of my principal Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>falſe,</hi> as well as the <hi>Concluſion</hi> it ſelf?
Has he proved that our <hi>title</hi> to the <hi>benefits</hi>
of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> does not depend on the <hi>actual
promiſe</hi> of <hi>God?</hi> or that our <hi>title</hi> to his

our <hi>Intereſt</hi> in his <hi>Covenant?</hi> or that our

by the <hi>Seals?</hi> or that the <hi>validity</hi>
of the <hi>Seals</hi> does not require <hi>Authority</hi> in
him who preſumes to <hi>uſe</hi> them? or that
the ſame <hi>Reaſons</hi> which made this <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
neceſſary for this <hi>validity</hi> of the <hi>Seals,</hi>
will not hold now (as well as they did in
the days of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi>) and for ever?
Does he <hi>deny any</hi> of theſe things? can he

them? Do any of his <hi>Arguments</hi> reach
them either <hi>directly,</hi> or by any <hi>clear</hi> and

by them who never received <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopal

how much more <hi>uncharitable</hi> will he

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>XI</label> The <hi>other particular</hi> is that which does
indeed look moſt like <hi>reaſoning</hi> and <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi>
of any thing that is ſaid by him in
his whole Book. And I ſhall endeavour
to ſhew him all the fair dealing I can, in
repreſenting what he ſays to the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
The Summ therefore of what
he ſays ſeems moſt conveniently reduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to theſe Propoſitions.</p>
               <p>1. That the power of the Miniſtry is
grounded on the gifts and qualifications of
the perſon immediately; ſo that whoever
has thoſe gifts and qualifications, has there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
an eſſential right to the power; and he
that beſtows thoſe gifts, does thereby beſtow
the power; and they who cannot beſtow
them, cannot conſequently diſpoſe of the
power.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:56909:24"/>
2. That God alone has the diſpoſal of
theſe gifts, and diſpoſes of theſe gifts imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
has never impowered men to confer
theſe gifts, but onely to examine and declare
them; which Declaration does not make but
find them qualified, and conſequently impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered,
before any humane interpoſition.</p>
               <p>3. That even in the Apoſtles times theſe
gifts and qualifications were not ordinarily
given in Ordination, but ſuppoſed to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent
to it; as appears from that gift of
Prophecy and diſcerning of Spirits, by which
they were enabled to judge who were fit to be
ordained; which muſt have related to gifts
and qualifications not given by the Apoſtles,
but by God immediately. And that if any
gifts and qualifications were ſuper added in
the very act of Ordination; yet they were
extraordinary, and therefore not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
by Succeſſors, eſpecially not at this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Age we live in.</p>
               <p>4. That theſe gifts being given by God
immediately, and this power being thus ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
conſequent to theſe gifts; even the
deſignation of the particular perſon is from
God, as well as the inveſting him with the
power. So that all that the interpoſition of men
can do in this matter, cannot be to give any
power to the perſon to be ordained that he had
not before; but onely to judge of it in order
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56909:24"/>
to acceptance, as to its exerciſe. The judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the perſon himſelf will be neceſſary in
order to his own acceptance. The judgment
of the Senior Paſtors (<hi>not in order to the</hi>
inveſting them by Ordination by delivery
with the power,<note place="margin">Part 3. c. 9. ſect. 7. p. 75</note> 
                  <hi>as Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>ſpeaks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtently
with his own Principles,
who acknowledges no</hi> power <hi>given by
the act of Ordination, for I am willing to
conſider his Cauſe free from the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
of his management; but</hi>) either
as they are the ordinary Repreſentatives of
the people in accepting, and ſuch as are firſt
to propoſe whatſoever is to be propoſed to the
people, even in affairs wherein their ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
are not ultimately concluded by their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives,
or as at leaſt the Solemnities
of Acceptance are to be tranſacted by them.
The judgment of the people alſo, as they are
the Objects of his Miniſtry, and as they are
ſuppoſed on that account to have the original
right of Acceptance.</p>
               <p>5. That the way to know what perſons are
by God inveſted with power, and with what
power they are inveſted, is by the Scriptures.
There he is ſuppoſed to have deſcribed the
gifts and qualifications, which when Paſtors
and People find in any man, they muſt be
ſuppoſed to be obliged to accept him. And
there he is ſuppoſed to have deſcribed that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56909:25"/>
power, which himſelf gives by giving him
ſuch gifts and qualifications.</p>
               <p>6. That this power being thus given by
God immediately, without any humane inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
in the giving it, but onely in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
it; conſequently the extent of this
power muſt be known by enquiring, not into
the mind of the Accepters, but of the giver of
it; and the mind of God the giver is to be
known onely in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>7. That the extent of this power being
thus to be gathered from the Scriptures, as
private perſons are not obliged to think their
Governours Expoſitions trueſt, but may with
reaſon and conſcience differ from them, (there
being nothing requiſite for the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Scriptures, that is capable of being
known by the Clergie, which learned Laicks
are not as capable of knowing alſo;) ſo pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
perſons may believe themſelves inveſted
with a power from the Scriptures, which
their Superiours neither gave them, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
to be the ſenſe of ſuch Scriptures, either
that themſelves ought to give it as authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
by God to do ſo, or that God will himſelf
give it immediately.</p>
               <p>8. That perſons authorized have not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
power to believe what they take to be the
ſenſe of the Scriptures, though different from
the ſenſe of ordinary Eccleſiaſtical Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56909:25"/>
but alſo to practiſe their different
ſenſe, at leaſt ſo far as their Authority ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends.
And therefore if a Biſhop or his
whole Presbytery, whether in irregular or
regular Aſſemblies, do deny a Presbyter any
part of his Office, which indeed they never
gave him, neither by any invalid, nor on
theſe principles by any valid, act of theirs;
he may notwithſtanding uſe and exerciſe it
as given him by God immediately.</p>
               <p>9. That every perſon for himſelf, as he is
as capable of underſtanding thoſe Scriptures,
which deſcribe the extent of the power as any
others, though Superiours; but yet is more
conſcious to himſelf of his own integrity, in
uſing means to the beſt of his abilities, and
following his own convictions, than any
others; ſo for the gifts and qualifications,
which by this Hypotheſis confer an immediate
title to the Office, he can much better judge
than any others, becauſe they are things more
within his own cognizance than they can be of
any others. So that in order to his own pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
he muſt on theſe principles be obliged in
reaſon, and conſcience, and prudence, more to
rely on his own judgment, than on that of
any others.</p>
               <p>10. That this power being immediately
from God, he is to preſume that what God did
once give, that he intends ſtill to give till
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56909:26"/>
he declares his pleaſure to the contrary. This
Obſervation will both make Scripture-prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
(which is the utmoſt they can pretend
concerning the power of Church Officers, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
in Scripture as in a Charter) an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
now, and will excuſe them from the
extreme difficult task to which their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
management does oblige them, of proving
it obligatory on other principles. For grant
it never ſo mutable in its own nature, yet
even mutable Determinations oblige till the
Legiſlators pleaſure be known for an actual
change. But ſuppoſing this power to have
been immediately from God, without any ſo
much as interpoſition of men; ſuppoſing
therefore (as has been ſhewed on theſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples)
that it muſt appear to us by an expreſs
word of God, ſuch as may ſeem expreſs to us
without humane Authority even in the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of it; ſuppoſing that no ſuch expreſs
word of God is ever to be expected for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
it will follow, that what is left deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
any way in the Scripture, muſt for
ever be as ſecure from an actual change, as if
it had been of its own nature immutable.
But if the power it ſelf be given by men;
then if they will prove it immutable by
the men who give it, they muſt endeavour
to prove it either from the nature of
the thing, or the continuance of the ſame
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56909:26"/>
reaſon and circumſtances of its firſt inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or ſome expreſs command of God in
Scripture, that they ſhould not actually
change it; which yet would not prove an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validity,
but onely an irregularity in their
doings, ſuppoſing the power not to come from
God immediately, but by their mediation;
which would be much more difficult for them
to prove than than they are aware of. Whence
it will further follow,</p>
               <p>11. That all that others can do, whether
Biſhops, or Presbyters, or People, cannot be
either to give any power, or to inform any
perſon that he has power, which he had
(though he knew it not) antecedently to their
Declaration; or to hinder him of the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of that power which he has, and may
know that he has independently on their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration:
and therefore can be onely to judge
for themſelves in order to their own accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
So that if they refuſe him, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
in conſcience hinder him from either
finding, or proſelyting others that will accept
him. And in the mean time he may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
that power where he can, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
it to the full extent of it, as far as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
conceives it to extend, becauſe he muſt
on theſe principles be ſuppoſed to have it,
and to know he has it, whether they accept
of it or not.</p>

with the <hi>office</hi> of a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> will
rather <hi>ruine</hi> than <hi>advance</hi> their Cauſe, as
I have accordingly retorted it in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Book. Since it is certain, that this
<hi>power of ordaining</hi> others was not <hi>given</hi>
to the firſt dividing <hi>Presbyters,</hi> it will
follow plainly that they were not made
<hi>Presbyters</hi> at all, if the <hi>power of Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
be <hi>eſſential</hi> to the <hi>office of a Presbyter.</hi>
And then their <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> will fail as well
on account of their want of <hi>true Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
as of their <hi>Presbyters</hi> wanting the
<hi>power of Ordination.</hi>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>XIV</label> BUT neither did I onely overthrow
their <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> on account of their firſt
<hi>Miniſters</hi> not receiving this <hi>power of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining</hi>
others, from the <hi>Biſhops</hi> who or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
them, but from the <hi>invalidity</hi> of
that <hi>act</hi> by which they derived their <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
to their <hi>Succeſſors,</hi> ſuppoſing they
had indeed received a <hi>power of Ordination.</hi>
Suppoſing they had it, yet they could not
<hi>exerciſe</hi> it but in <hi>lawful Aſſemblies,</hi> which
none but the <hi>Biſhops</hi> as <hi>Preſidents of the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56909:29"/>
Presbyteries</hi> had <hi>power to indict;</hi> nor yet
even there, ſuppoſing all <hi>Presbyters equal,</hi>
could they carry it but by <hi>plurality of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages.</hi>
And therefore the generality of
their <hi>later Ordinations</hi> being performed
by <hi>ſingle over-voted</hi> perſons, without the
conſent of the <hi>greater part</hi> of thoſe <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries</hi>
of which they were originally
Members, and out of <hi>lawful Aſſemblies,</hi>
muſt on theſe accounts be not onely <hi>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular</hi>
but <hi>invalid</hi> too. Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no <hi>Presbyters</hi> were at all made,
and therefore it is in vain to talk of <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
to prove the power of <hi>legal Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,</hi>
when theſe are not the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of whom thoſe <hi>Charters</hi> ſpeak, and
whoſe <hi>power</hi> they are conceived to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe.</hi>
And the ſame is applicable alſo to
the <hi>Commonalty.</hi> Neither can they exert
any power of which they might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
have been capable, but by <hi>majority
of Votes,</hi> and in <hi>regular Aſſemblies.</hi> If they
do, it is <hi>Null</hi> by the <hi>fundamental prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
even of <hi>Democratical Government.</hi>
This therefore will deſtroy the <hi>validity</hi> of

                  <hi>Brethren</hi> of our own <hi>Communion,</hi> than

I ſhall onely deſire at preſent, that what

that <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Power</hi> is not conferred
<hi>immediately by God,</hi> but <hi>mediately</hi> by the
interpoſition of the <hi>Ordainers.</hi> And on
that <hi>ſuppoſition</hi> I cannot conceive what
reaſon there can be to queſtion it. Who

be conveyed to others by virtue of ſome

muſt judge, that all <hi>Ordainers</hi> ought to
<hi>mean</hi> to give that Power, which by the
<hi>principles</hi> of their Communion is thought
proper for the <hi>Office</hi> to which the perſon
is ordained; and to mean to <hi>withhold</hi> that
which by the <hi>principles</hi> of their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
is thought <hi>unlawful</hi> to be given to
that <hi>Office?</hi> Who can doubt but where
it was thought <hi>Hereſie</hi> to believe, that
<hi>Biſhops and Presbyters</hi> had the ſame <hi>power,</hi>
there it muſt alſo have been thought <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful</hi>
to give it them? Who can doubt
but that where the <hi>Power of Ordination</hi>
was taken for the peculiar <hi>prerogative</hi> of
the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> there it muſt have been
thought unlawful to give this particular
<hi>branch of power</hi> of ſimple <hi>Presbyters?</hi> If
all theſe <hi>ſuppoſitions</hi> agree with the <hi>matter

is not agreeable to the <hi>notions or practices</hi>

any ſuch thing as <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Power</hi>

who utterly <hi>deprive</hi> the Church of
any ſuch <hi>power,</hi> or of being a <hi>political So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</hi>
I do not ſay but that it may <hi>follow</hi>
from ſome <hi>principles</hi> expreſly owned by
them, (as particularly from that <hi>principle</hi>
ſo much received among the <hi>Sects,</hi> that
it is <hi>diſhonourable</hi> to think, that the <hi>Holy

but onely that it is not agreeable to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56909:32"/>
their <hi>notions and practices</hi> concerning Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
For all that hold any ſuch
thing as <hi>Government</hi> muſt, unleſs they
will make it perfectly <hi>uſeleſs,</hi> own a <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of reſtraining</hi> particular perſons from
<hi>Innovation;</hi> I mean, which may <hi>in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
oblige ſuch perſons, (how different
ſoever from the <hi>ſentiments</hi> of their <hi>Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours,</hi>
yet) even <hi>in conſcience</hi> to forbear
<hi>Diviſions</hi> in the ſame <hi>Churches,</hi> or erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
new ones in oppoſition to thoſe
which are already eſtabliſhed. But this
cannot be maintained by this <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi>
For where all that others can do, can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hinder a <hi>private perſon</hi> from <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
nor from <hi>knowing</hi> that he has it, not
even from ſuch a <hi>knowledge</hi> as may ſuffice
<hi>in conſcience,</hi> to juſtifie his <hi>acting</hi> purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly
to that <hi>Authority.</hi> There it is plain
he is under no obligation to forbear
drawing <hi>parties</hi> after him if he can. As
for the <hi>Intereſt</hi> others have in admitting
him for their <hi>Miniſter,</hi> that ſignifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to this purpoſe: It onely ſecures
that they ſhall not be drawn away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

what uſe is there of <hi>Government?</hi> If he
can perſuade and ſeduce them, he will

ſo, becauſe in order to <hi>perſuaſion</hi>
there is, on theſe <hi>principles,</hi> no obligation
incumbent on <hi>private perſons</hi> from the
Determinations of <hi>Aſſemblies.</hi> For as
that <hi>private knowledge,</hi> which ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
may have of his own <hi>Authority,</hi> may
ſuffice to juſtifie his <hi>own acting</hi> as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<hi>authorized,</hi> ſo the <hi>private evidence</hi>
every <hi>particular perſon</hi> may have of his
<hi>Gifts,</hi> and conſequently of his <hi>Authority</hi>
grounded on thoſe <hi>Gifts,</hi> may alſo ſuffice
for to make it lawful for ſuch a perſon to
receive him for his own <hi>private uſe,</hi>

alſo poſſible to be had without any gift

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56909:33"/>
it fully anſwers the <hi>deſigns</hi> of our modern
<hi>Enthuſiaſts. It agrees with their principles.</hi>
For theſe are they who indeed make the

ſo that where <hi>women</hi> have the <hi>gifts,</hi> they
are thought to have as good a title to the

now as well as in the time of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles;</hi>
conceive theſe <hi>gifts</hi> to be given by

as that he cannot deny but that <hi>others</hi> of
his Brethren, who are ſuppoſed to have
the <hi>like gifts,</hi> have alſo a right to judge
of <hi>his gifts</hi> in order to their <hi>own reception.
It anſwers their deſigns.</hi> For receiving
their <hi>Authority</hi> immediately from God,
it follows in courſe that they ſhould not
<hi>in reaſon</hi> be reſponſible to any but him.
And as they are not ſuppoſed to receive
any <hi>Authority</hi> from <hi>men,</hi> ſo neither is
there any rational Obligation for <hi>depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
or ſubjection to men.</hi> This I warn

that they, who upon other occaſions <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi>

               <p>THESE things therefore being thus

                  <note place="margin">§ XVIII</note> I come now more cloſely to
examine the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> it ſelf. No doubt
ſome <hi>Diſpoſitions</hi> are neceſſary to <hi>qualifie</hi>
men for <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Offices.</hi> No doubt
it is fit that <hi>Ordainers</hi> ſhould judge who
have thoſe <hi>Diſpoſitions</hi> before they intruſt
them with the <hi>Offices</hi> for which they are
<hi>qualified</hi> by ſuch <hi>Diſpoſitions.</hi> No doubt
but theſe <hi>Diſpoſitions</hi> are <hi>Gods gifts,</hi> not
onely on account of that <hi>common Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
by which even <hi>natural endowments</hi>
are his <hi>gifts,</hi> but alſo an account of that
<hi>ſupernatural aſſiſtance</hi> which is thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for all <hi>virtues and ordinary graces,</hi>
in oppoſition to the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> and for all
iminent Diſcriminations between Men
and Men. But theſe things are not more
proper to <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> than to <hi>Secular Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:56909:34"/>
There is alſo the like neceſſity of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſitions</hi>
for <hi>Secular</hi> as for <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments.</hi>
There is a like neceſſity of <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
as well as of <hi>Gifts</hi> among thoſe <hi>Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</hi>
There is a like neceſſity of <hi>Divine</hi>

which tend to the accompliſhing of men
for ſuch Imployments, as there is for
thoſe that fit men for <hi>Eccleſiaſticals.</hi> Yet
who is there that therefore thinks that

to any interpoſition of <hi>Men?</hi> What
<hi>confuſions and diſorders,</hi> what <hi>violations of

               <p>BUT not to take advantage againſt
theſe <hi>principles</hi> from the <hi>falſhood</hi> of their
Conſequences,<note place="margin">§ XIX.</note> themſelves are alſo very
queſtionable. <hi>It is very unreaſonable to
think that Authority muſt neceſſarily reſult
from even true qualifications; or that it muſt
ſo depend on them, as that where the perſons
ordained may want any of them, there the
whole Ordination muſt be Null, becauſe of
the incapacity of the matter.</hi> I ſhall ſpeak
to both theſe Uſes of this Argument, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are both of them, as occaſion
ſerves, inſiſted on by Mr. <hi>Baxter. 1. It
is unreaſonable to conclude that Authority
muſt neceſſarily reſult even from the true
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56909:34"/>
qualifications.</hi> It is not agreeable to the
ſentiments of Mankind in <hi>chuſing perſons
qualified.</hi> They certainly ſuppoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
qualified <hi>antecedently</hi> to their own
<hi>election</hi> of them, becauſe their judging.
them ſo is the <hi>reaſon</hi> why they do <hi>elect
them.</hi> But do they therefore ſuppoſe
them already <hi>authorized?</hi> If ſo, what
need of any further act of <hi>giving the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er?</hi>
How ſhall they do when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
<hi>many Candidates</hi> ſufficiently qualified
for an Office, of which notwithſtanding
onely <hi>one</hi> is capable? Can their <hi>not
electing</hi> them <hi>deprive</hi> the perſons rejected
of their qualifications? Can it upon theſe
principles <hi>deprive</hi> them of their <hi>authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
if that do neceſſarily <hi>reſult</hi> from their
qualifications? If it cannot, then in caſe
of an <hi>Elective Kingdom,</hi> all the perſons
who were admitted as <hi>Candidates</hi> (which
they would not have been, if their <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi>
at leaſt had not <hi>judged them qualified</hi>)
muſt, when they are <hi>put by</hi> as well as <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi>
be ſuppoſed to be <hi>Kings.</hi> And
where can ſuch a ſuppoſition end but in a
<hi>Civil War?</hi> But among all the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
pretenſions that have been made
by perſons <hi>intereſſed,</hi> and of <hi>power</hi> ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to proſecute their <hi>Intereſts</hi> by force,
what <hi>Hiſtory</hi> can afford an inſtance of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56909:35"/>
any one who challenged the <hi>power</hi> onely
becauſe he was thought <hi>qualified,</hi> and
permitted to ſtand <hi>Candidate</hi> for it?</p>
               <p>THUS it is in caſe of <hi>Supreme Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§ XX.</note>
but much more in <hi>Subordinate.</hi> They
who have derived the <hi>Supreme Power</hi>
from God, that they might this way the
better aſſert their <hi>Unaccountableneſs to
Men,</hi> have for that very reaſon thought
it neceſſary, that <hi>inferiour Governours</hi>
ſhould receive their power from <hi>Men,</hi>
that they may thereby be made <hi>dependent
and accountable</hi> to thoſe Men (as well as
God) from whom they had received it.
And who is there that doubts, but that a
<hi>legal warrant</hi> of the meaneſt <hi>Juſtice of
Peace</hi> is of more force in Law, than the
<hi>advice</hi> of the ableſt and moſt prudent
<hi>Lawyer,</hi> who is much better <hi>qualified</hi> to be
a <hi>Juſtice</hi> than he who is one? This is
the ſenſe of <hi>Mankind,</hi> which (beſides that
it overthrows the <hi>conſequence,</hi> that if the
<hi>gifts</hi> of particular Miniſters be from <hi>God</hi>
immediately, therefore their <hi>Authority</hi>
muſt be ſo too, till proved more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
than as yet they have attempted to

do take it for the beſt <hi>preſervative of Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties,</hi>
to have all <hi>inferiour Governours</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to a ſtrict dependence on the <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme;</hi>
and the beſt <hi>security</hi> of this, that
<hi>Inferiours,</hi> whatever their <hi>qualifications</hi>

from their <hi>Superiours;</hi> then certainly we
have reaſon to <hi>preſume,</hi> even on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that this ſame Method was alſo

for <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS <hi>preſumption</hi> there is,<note place="margin">§ XXI.</note> that <hi>God</hi>
would never make this <hi>Authority</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
conſequent to the <hi>qualifications</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
to diſpoſe men, from the <hi>notions</hi> of
Mankind concerning <hi>Government in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</hi>
And as little reaſon there is to believe
it from the <hi>particular principles of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
Government,</hi> thoſe very <hi>principles</hi>
I mean which are owned by themſelves
when they are <hi>ſettling,</hi> though they are
forgotten and contradicted when they are
onely intent upon <hi>overthrowing the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:56909:36"/>
of their own <hi>Superiours.</hi> When they
as well as I make the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> a
<hi>power of ſealing Covenants in Gods Name,</hi>
and of <hi>tranſacting</hi> for him with Mankind,
it is ſtrange how they could fall into this
miſtake, if they had minded being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
to theſe <hi>principles.</hi> No doubt who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
would imploy a <hi>proxy</hi> to act in his
name, and to make <hi>legal covenants</hi> that
ſhould oblige himſelf, would in prudence
chuſe one that ſhould be skilful in the
<hi>Law,</hi> and prudent as well as faithful
to his <hi>truſt.</hi> But which of themſelves
would therefore give an <hi>indefinite Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
to all that were ſo qualified to ſeal
<hi>legal obligations</hi> for them without a more
particular Deputation? Which of them
would think themſelves <hi>juſtly</hi> dealt with,
or obliged even <hi>in conſcience</hi> to perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
if any perſon whom even them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
could not deny to be ſo <hi>qualified,</hi>
ſhould preſume to do ſo? And can they
think <hi>God</hi> legally obliged in a caſe,
wherein they would think themſelves
<hi>injured</hi> if it were their own? Is this to
judge of <hi>God</hi> by the ſame meaſures by
which they would be content to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by themſelves, which <hi>God</hi> owns as
<hi>juſt,</hi> and appeals to in the <hi>Prophets?</hi> If
themſelves think other <hi>qualifications</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56909:36"/>
for <hi>truſt</hi> as well as for <hi>abilities of
management of a truſt</hi> to be committed to
them, before they think it prudent to
<hi>entruſt</hi> a perſon, even of <hi>known and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
Abilities,</hi> with a power of <hi>obliging
themſelves;</hi> has not <hi>God</hi> the ſame <hi>frail
perſons</hi> to deal with, who may fail in <hi>fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
to his <hi>truſt,</hi> as well as in point of <hi>abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
to diſcharge it? But to let alone the
<hi>inconvenience,</hi> and to inſiſt onely on the
<hi>juſtice</hi> of this Cauſe; do not themſelves
look upon this <hi>right</hi> of diſpoſing of what
is their <hi>own gift,</hi> and of <hi>impowering others</hi>
to do it, as a <hi>right</hi> inherent in themſelves,
which no other mans <hi>qualifications,</hi> how
great or acknowledged ſoever, can in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
alienate from themſelves, or entitle
him to, without a more particular <hi>act</hi> of
their own? And muſt the <hi>power of God</hi>
in <hi>ſealing Covenants for Heaven</hi> and the
<hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and <hi>pardon of ſins,</hi> eſcheat to
all that are <hi>qualified,</hi> without any more
diſtinct <hi>gift</hi> than that of their <hi>qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
themſelves? Of the two, certainly
the diſadvantage does rather lie on the
<hi>creature</hi>'s ſide. Their <hi>rights</hi> may indeed
be diſpoſed of in ſome caſes <hi>without their
own act,</hi> becauſe they are not abſolutely
at their <hi>own diſpoſal,</hi> but depend on the
<hi>pleaſure of God,</hi> and of their <hi>lawful Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:56909:37"/>
impowered by him. But the <hi>inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency</hi>
of the <hi>Divine Right</hi> excludes all
<hi>poſſibility</hi> of any caſe wherein any <hi>right</hi> of
his can be diſpoſed of without his own
particular <hi>conſent and act</hi> for diſpoſing
of it.</p>
               <p>AND yet of all <hi>Rights,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§ XXII.</note> 
                  <hi>Forgiveneſs
of offences</hi> committed againſt any one, is
that which is leaſt capable of a <hi>general
alienation. Property in Goods,</hi> eſpecially
as among Men, depends generally on
<hi>compacts</hi> or <hi>poſitive humane</hi> (and therefore
variable) Conſtitutions. But <hi>offences</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to their <hi>perſons,</hi> as alſo the <hi>grief and
reſentment</hi> conſequent to them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

as <hi>property in goods;</hi> and the remitting of
Offences does eſſentially conſiſt in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of that <hi>perſonal reſentment,</hi> and
other miſchiefs as conſequent to it, and
therefore muſt be as <hi>unalienable</hi> from any
as his <hi>own perſon.</hi> As long as his <hi>perſon</hi> is
free and at his own diſpoſal, ſo long none
but <hi>himſelf</hi> can undertake for the manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

their own power to recall them. They
may diſpoſſes themſelves both of their
<hi>goods</hi> and of their <hi>power</hi> to right them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and even of their <hi>legal right and
equity</hi> by ſome leſs prudent management.
But neither can <hi>God</hi> act imprudently, nor
are his gifts at the <hi>actual diſpoſal</hi> of his
Creatures, even where he has <hi>obliged</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to ratifie what is engaged for in his

that muſt immediately confer the

any without a moſt particular and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs

               </p>
               <p>YET is not this all;<note place="margin">§ XXIII</note> we are to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
further, that in <hi>forgiving or puniſhing
ſin</hi> God acts under the notion of a <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi>
Now a <hi>Governour</hi> has not the ſame
liberty in <hi>forgiving offences</hi> againſt the

perſon,</hi> as a <hi>private perſon</hi> may have in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<hi>private injuries.</hi> A private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
need onely conſider his own <hi>private
intereſt,</hi> and in doing ſo he may remit
much of his <hi>own right</hi> where no others
are concerned. But a <hi>publick perſon</hi> muſt
conſider the <hi>publick intereſt,</hi> and muſt not
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56909:38"/>
take any other courſe in forgiving <hi>publick
offences,</hi> than what may be beneficial for
the <hi>publick. Humane Governours</hi> are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
hereunto by the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> by
the nature of the <hi>truſt</hi> committed to
them, by the <hi>implicite interpoſitions of
Providence</hi> by which they are made Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
and by the common <hi>dictates of
natural conſcience.</hi> And even God is alſo
obliged to it, not by <hi>impoſition</hi> of any
<hi>Superiour,</hi> but by his own <hi>natural inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
Having undertaken the <hi>perſon</hi> of
a <hi>Governour,</hi> it is as impoſſible that he
ſhould uſe any other methods in <hi>pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
offences againſt his <hi>Government,</hi> than
what is for the benefit of the <hi>Society,</hi>
whoſe <hi>government</hi> he has undertaken, as
it is impoſſible that he ſhould not act <hi>well

that they ſhould have a <hi>right</hi> to paſs a
<hi>pardon</hi> under the <hi>Broad Seal,</hi> and in due
<hi>ſolemnities of Law,</hi> for no other reaſon
but onely becauſe they are <hi>qualified</hi> for
it? Who thinks ſuch <hi>Pardons valid,</hi> or
thinks it <hi>juſt and reaſonable</hi> that they
ſhould be ſo? How is it poſſible that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56909:38"/>
                  <hi>Government</hi> ſhould ever be maintained, if
the <hi>right</hi> of it be reſolved into <hi>pleas</hi> ſo ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of being made uſe of by falſe <hi>preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
and ſo little <hi>notorious</hi> to <hi>Subjects</hi> that
are ſo highly concern'd in it? How can <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
be maintained where <hi>Inferiours</hi>
may pardon what their <hi>Superiours</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn,
where <hi>Rebels</hi> may juſtifie or pardon
their own <hi>Rebellions,</hi> by as good a <hi>title</hi> as

do, if <hi>Inferiours</hi> as well as <hi>Superiours</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
their Authority from God <hi>immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>)
where pretended <hi>Expoſitions of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
againſt the ſenſe of all the preſent

thought to give men an <hi>authority</hi> here in

muſt yet by this means be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
uncapable of <hi>conviction</hi> till the <hi>day
of judgment?</hi> For what can in the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
more neceſſarily inveſt men with
<hi>authority,</hi> than this power of <hi>pardoning

the <hi>publick?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THUS <hi>unreaſonable</hi> it is to believe,<note place="margin">§ XXIV</note>
that bare <hi>qualifications</hi> do inveſt any with
<hi>actual power?</hi> What can they now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
further, but an <hi>authority</hi> ſufficient to
countervail and ſilence all theſe contrary
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56909:39"/>
Reaſonings? I repeat not now what I
have elſewhere proved,<note place="margin">Prolog. ad D. Stearn de Obſtin.</note> that ſome <hi>reaſons</hi>
are ſuch, as to be greater Evidence than
any other <hi>authority</hi> whatſoever. I inſiſt
not on what might have been ſaid to
ſhew, that the <hi>reaſons</hi> now produced are
of that ſort. But alas, how little do they
produce to prove this from <hi>authority,</hi>
which yet is the foundation of all their
<hi>conſequential reaſonings?</hi> How much leſs
to prove <hi>their ſenſe</hi> to be the <hi>ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
than what has been produced to
prove the <hi>contrary</hi> to be the <hi>ſenſe of God?</hi>
They obſerve, that <hi>God</hi> is ſaid to have
<hi>given ſome Apoſtles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>ſome Paſtors, &amp;c.</hi> as
if their very <hi>gifts</hi> had <hi>made</hi> them ſo. But
where do they find that <hi>God</hi> ever <hi>gave
Biſhops, Presbyters, and Deacons?</hi> Will
they not allow ſome <hi>difference</hi> between
the <hi>extraordinary offices</hi> there ſpoken of,
and the <hi>ordinary</hi> ones of which we are at
preſent diſputing? Will they not allow
a <hi>difference</hi> in this very matter of their
<hi>gifts?</hi> Whither do they reaſon ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
from thoſe <hi>extraordinaries</hi> to theſe
<hi>ordinaries?</hi> Thoſe <hi>extraordinary offices</hi> ſeem
indeed to have been made neither of <hi>man</hi>
nor by <hi>man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 1. 1.</note> but by <hi>God</hi> himſelf <hi>immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
and poſſibly by the degrees of their <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration</hi>
received their ſeveral <hi>denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:56909:39"/>
of that kind reſpectively. Thus
S. <hi>Paul</hi> proves his <hi>Apoſtleſhip,</hi> which it
ſeems was then called in queſtion by his
Rival <hi>falſe Apoſtles,</hi> among other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
by that eſpecially, that he was
made ſo before he had ever ſeen any of
the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and when he did ſee them,
that they received him on <hi>equal terms,</hi>
and <hi>added nothing to him</hi> above what he
had received before. And what <hi>men</hi>
could pretend to give that Supreme Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the <hi>Apoſtolical Office</hi> who were not
themſelves <hi>Apoſtles?</hi> The like might
have been obſerved concerning others of
thoſe <hi>extraordinary offices.</hi> And I have
before conjectured that, according to
theſe <hi>extraordinary gifts,</hi> ſo they perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the ſeveral Offices of their <hi>Eccleſiaſtical
Aſſemblies.</hi> So I underſtand the <gap reason="foreign">

to which the <hi>Amen</hi> was in courſe replied
by him who anſwered among the <hi>people,</hi>
as it was anſwered in the Office of the
<hi>Euchariſt</hi> in the time of S. <hi>Juſtin Martyr.</hi>
And can they deſire any more? Yet even
then there was this dependence on the
<hi>ordinary Officers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> that even
theſe <hi>extraordinary gifts</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi>
were generally not given but by that
<hi>Impoſition of hands,</hi> which uſually follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56909:40"/>
after their Baptiſm, that even then
their deviating from the <hi>Spirit</hi> of thoſe
from whom they had <hi>received the Spirit</hi>
in that <hi>office,</hi> at leaſt of <hi>confirmation,</hi> was
a <hi>preſumption</hi> againſt thoſe who firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated

                  <note place="margin">Gal. 11. 6, 7, 8, 9.</note> (ſo S. <hi>Paul</hi>
proves his own Orthodoxy from his

before him, though he had not received
his Doctrine from them, and he general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preſuppoſes this Principle in his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes
againſt the <hi>diſorderly Prophets.</hi>)
That there were <hi>manifeſtations</hi> of the
<hi>Spirit, ſigns</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtleſhips,</hi> the <hi>gifts
of diſcerning of the Spirits,</hi> and <hi>Judges of
the Spirits</hi> for the ſatisfaction of <hi>others,</hi> not
onely to judge in order to their <hi>own recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
(as our Brethren would have it)
but to judge ſo as that they were not to
be preſumed to have the <hi>Spirit</hi> at all, who
could not abide their Judgments, if after
their rejection they preſumed to exerciſe
any ſuch <hi>gifts</hi> in the ſtate of <hi>Separation.</hi>
If they will plead theſe <hi>extraordinary gifts</hi>
themſelves, let them grant the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the <hi>like gifts</hi> in their <hi>Superiours,</hi>
and we ſhall be at leaſt ſecure from any
<hi>Schiſmatical Conſequences</hi> of ſuch pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
But if they will <hi>alone</hi> challenge
this continuance to <hi>themſelves;</hi> let them
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56909:40"/>
conſider how <hi>unequal dealing</hi> this is; let
them conſider how different from their

when they ſeparate thoſe <hi>gifts</hi>
now which then were made <hi>mutually</hi> uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
by their <hi>conjunction;</hi> how different
this is from the Judgment of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi>
themſelves, and conſequently of <hi>God,</hi> by
whom the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
inſpir'd in what they did relating to
theſe <hi>extraordinaries,</hi> who did not it ſeems
think theſe pretences to <hi>extraordinaries</hi>
ſafe, without theſe remedies from the
<hi>gifts of others,</hi> and particularly of <hi>Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours.</hi>
Several of theſe things were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſuggeſted and proved, and will be
more particularly in my <hi>Second Part,</hi> if it
pleaſe God to encourage me to go on
with it, by which this whole Reaſoning
is overthrown, which is drawn from
theſe <hi>Apoſtolical Precedents,</hi> even in <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinaries.</hi>
               </p>

When S. <hi>Matthias</hi> was choſen

that the Influence of <hi>humane acts</hi> was <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               <p>BESIDES,<note place="margin">§ XXVII.</note> the very Ceremony of

to <hi>communicate</hi> ſome of thoſe <hi>ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56909:43"/>
gifts,</hi> wherewith they were <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi>
endued. So it was in their <hi>caſting
out of Devils.</hi> and their <hi>curing the ſick,</hi> and
particularly ſo it was in their <hi>giving the
Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And indeed what other <hi>gift</hi>
is imaginable, that was <hi>ordinarily</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for <hi>ordained</hi> perſons? Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
cannot think it could be <hi>diſpoſſeſſing</hi>
or <hi>healing, &amp;c.</hi> What could it therefore
be but the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> himſelf? And
what <hi>gifts</hi> could be then thought neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for making <hi>ordinary Officers,</hi> but ſuch
as are <hi>ordinary and perpetual</hi> as the <hi>Offices</hi>
themſelves? If therefore the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi>
was given, this was (according to the
<hi>Jews</hi>) an <hi>inveſting</hi> them with <hi>power,</hi>
where he was given <hi>particularly</hi> with ſuch
a deſign. So it was in the caſe of<note n="a" place="margin">1 Sam. 10. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Saul</hi>
and<note n="b" place="margin">1 Sam. 16. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>David,</hi> and of the<note n="c" place="margin">S. John 20. 20, 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Apoſtles</hi>
themſelves. And what other <hi>deſign</hi> is
conceivable in giving the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> to
them, who were ſuppoſed already to
have received him <hi>before</hi> in their <hi>Baptiſm,</hi>
and that <hi>Impoſition of hands</hi> which then
uſually accompanied their <hi>Baptiſm?</hi> And
if the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> were given in <hi>Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
then plainly they had not all their
<hi>gifts antecedently</hi> to their <hi>Ordination,</hi> as
our Brethren conceive, particularly not
thoſe which <hi>immediately</hi> intituled them
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56909:43"/>
to <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Power.</hi> If theſe Gifts of
the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> (which immediately inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled
them to Power) were <hi>given</hi> them by
the <hi>miniſtry</hi> of Men; then certainly the
Power it ſelf was not given them imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
by <hi>God,</hi> but by <hi>humane miniſtry.</hi>
And therefore their <hi>antecedent gifts</hi>
(which they judged of by the <hi>gift of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerning
of Spirits</hi>) did not <hi>immediately</hi>
give them the <hi>power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE great Prejudice that poſſeſſes
our Brethren againſt this <hi>power</hi> being
thus given by the <hi>miniſtry of men,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§ XXVIII.</note> is that,
conceiving it to reſult from the <hi>gift</hi> of
the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> they think it diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> to ſay that he is <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by men.</hi> But how can they deny thoſe
plain Evidences of Scripture wherein he
was ſo frequently <hi>given</hi> by the <hi>Apoſtles?</hi>
Will not their Conjectures reach <hi>them</hi>
as well as our <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Officers</hi> now?
Were not they men of the like <hi>frail ſinful
nature</hi> as ours are now? But if they
would indeed conſider <hi>how</hi> he does it,
what is there more <hi>diſhonourable</hi> in this
than in the whole management of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation?</hi>
Why may not <hi>God the Father</hi>
and <hi>Son</hi> (whoſe Gift undoubtedly he is)
give him by <hi>covenant</hi> as well as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe?
Why may not himſelf do ſo too?
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56909:44"/>
Suppoſing them willing to take this <hi>way</hi>
of diſpoſing of him, what can hinder
them from deputing <hi>men</hi> to repreſent
them in the <hi>ſolemnities</hi> of ſuch a <hi>covenant</hi>
to be made with <hi>men?</hi> What is there in
this, I do not ſay <hi>diſhonourable,</hi> but <hi>unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual,</hi>
where ever ſuch <hi>covenants</hi> have been
made? Having done ſo, how can it be
thought <hi>diſhonourable</hi> that they ſhould be
obliged by their own <hi>act of deputation,</hi> to
ratifie what is by him acted in their
<hi>name,</hi> when they have <hi>impowered</hi> him to
do ſo? Nay, would it not rather be <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable</hi>
to the Divine Perſons, to
think them not <hi>faithful</hi> to thoſe <hi>obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
which they have been pleaſed to <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi>
upon themſelves? Why may they
not <hi>impower men</hi> for all <hi>future ages</hi> as well
as that of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> ſeeing there are
<hi>new perſons,</hi> and new <hi>explicit covenants</hi> to
be made with each of them for their <hi>own
perſons</hi> in all <hi>ſucceeding ages?</hi> Why may
not they be as firmly <hi>obliged</hi> by the act of
a <hi>wicked man</hi> as a <hi>good,</hi> if he come <hi>lawfully</hi>
by his <hi>power of deputation,</hi> by a <hi>regular ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion</hi>
from thoſe who firſt received it?
Nay, who is there of themſelves, that
does the leaſt queſtion this in other caſes,
where their <hi>Intereſt</hi> does not make them
juſtly ſuſpicious of <hi>partiality?</hi> Does the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56909:44"/>
                  <hi>Law</hi> ever make the leaſt inquiry into the
<hi>Lives of Proxies,</hi> where it is ſatisfied of
their <hi>Authority?</hi> Who ever thinks that
a <hi>Bond</hi> ſigned by a <hi>Proxy,</hi> who is a <hi>good
man,</hi> does more oblige the perſon for
whom he is concerned, than a like Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
ſigned by another who were <hi>viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi>
ſuppoſing them <hi>equally authorized?</hi>
Do any of themſelves think what <hi>Judas</hi>
acted as an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> to have been leſs <hi>obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging</hi>
to his <hi>Maſter,</hi> or leſs <hi>valid</hi> in the
<hi>effect,</hi> than what was acted by any of
the <hi>other Apoſtles?</hi> Thus I have ſhewn,
that thoſe <hi>gifts</hi> to which <hi>Eccleſiaſtical
Power</hi> is really <hi>conſequent,</hi> are not given
by <hi>God</hi> immediately and antecedently to
<hi>humane interpoſition,</hi> and that thoſe <hi>gifts</hi>
that are indeed given antecedently to <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,</hi>
are not, nor were, ſuch as did
entitle them, who were acknowledged to
have them, to any <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Office or
Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SO alſo,<note place="margin">§ XXIX</note> on the contrary, neither does
the <hi>want</hi> of ſuch <hi>extraordinary gifts</hi> as <hi>men</hi>
are capable of having <hi>antecedently to Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
irritate the whole <hi>act</hi> of the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainers,</hi>
and make it <hi>null,</hi> in regard of the
<hi>incapacity</hi> of the <hi>maker,</hi> ſuppoſing they
ſhould be miſtaken in judging them to
have them who have them not, as
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56909:45"/>
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> does frequently intimate. This
he urges ſometimes ſo far as to make <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities</hi>
of <hi>Life</hi> ſufficient to <hi>deprive</hi>
them of their <hi>power,</hi> and to excuſe a <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
from their <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> from the
guilt of <hi>SCHISM.</hi> Should I tell him,
that this very Doctrine of his was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
as <hi>SCHISMATICAL</hi> in
the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> by the <hi>Ancients,</hi> I eaſily
foreſee how little the Authority of thoſe
<hi>Ancients</hi> is like to ſignifie with him, who
ſcruples no occaſion of aſperſing their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Memory with opprobrious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful
Epithetes.<note place="margin">Ch. Hiſt. profeſſedly, and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</note> I have already
ſhewn from the nature of the <hi>things,</hi> how
little the <hi>validity</hi> of their <hi>Miniſtry</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in the holineſs or unholineſs of
their <hi>Lives.</hi> The ſame is eaſie to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
concerning thoſe other <hi>qualifications,</hi>
if he had conſidered them in relation to
<hi>my principles.</hi> He ſhould firſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
that there are two ſorts of
<hi>Uncapacities</hi> of ſuch a perſon to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,
ſuch as make him utterly <hi>unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable</hi>
of the Office it ſelf, and ſuch as
onely make him <hi>uncapable</hi> of <hi>adminiſtring</hi>
it wiſely and advantageouſly. Now
though theſe <hi>later Uncapacities</hi> ought to
be conſidered by <hi>Ordainers,</hi> whileſt the
perſon as yet ſtands onely <hi>Candidate</hi> for
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56909:45"/>
                  <hi>Ordination,</hi> and even afterwards may
reflect on the <hi>fidelity or prudence</hi> of his <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainers;</hi>
yet they are onely the <hi>former</hi>
ſort of <hi>Incapacities</hi> that can <hi>irritate</hi> their
act when <hi>paſt</hi> and <hi>irrevocable.</hi> He ſhould
further have conſidered, that no <hi>Incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi>
can <hi>irritate</hi> the whole <hi>gift</hi> of an <hi>office,</hi>
but that which makes a man uncapable
of the <hi>eſſential work</hi> of an <hi>office;</hi> not that
which onely incapacitates him for ſuch
works as are not <hi>eſſential,</hi> but onely <hi>orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental.</hi>
Now the <hi>eſſential work</hi> of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry</hi>
according to my <hi>principles,</hi> (which
he ought to have confuted more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
in this matter, if he was unwilling
to ſtand by their <hi>conſequences</hi>) is to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
between <hi>God</hi>-and <hi>Men,</hi> to <hi>ſeal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants</hi>
on behalf of <hi>God,</hi> and to <hi>accept</hi> of
thoſe which are made by <hi>men,</hi> and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
them to perform <hi>their part</hi> of the <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>
by, otherwiſe <hi>authoritatively</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
them from <hi>Gods part.</hi> Hence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults
the whole <hi>power of Eccleſiaſtical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi>
And for this no great <hi>gifts</hi>
and <hi>abilities</hi> are <hi>eſſential.</hi> All the <hi>skill</hi>
that is requiſite <hi>eſſentially</hi> is onely in <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
to know the <hi>benefits</hi> to be performed
on <hi>Gods part,</hi> and the <hi>duties</hi> to be promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
on <hi>Mans,</hi> and the nature and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>covenants in general,</hi> and the <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56909:46"/>
Solemnities of Eccleſiaſtical Covenants.</hi>
And of this how can any be <hi>uncapable,</hi>
who is but capable of underſtanding the
<hi>common</hi> dealings of the <hi>world?</hi> And how
can <hi>Governours</hi> be ſuppoſed ſo groſly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken,

               <p>THE <hi>gifts</hi> ſo much inſiſted on by Mr.

                  <note place="margin">§ XXX.</note> are ſuch as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh

if it were the <hi>onely,</hi> or at leaſt the <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal,</hi>
imployment of the <hi>Miniſtry.</hi> But
how can they prove that, ſuppoſe their

<hi>particular Officer,</hi> that he be <hi>eminently
gifted</hi> for and <hi>skilful</hi> in it? How can
they prove that <hi>Preaching</hi> is at all any
<hi>eſſential part</hi> of the <hi>office?</hi> How can they
prove that in the <hi>primitive Apoſtolical
times,</hi> every <hi>particular Presbyter</hi> did either
<hi>practice</hi> it, or did think himſelf <hi>obliged</hi>
to do ſo? If they cannot, how will it
follow that he who is <hi>lawfully</hi> impower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
muſt therefore be no <hi>Miniſter</hi> on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of <hi>incapacity,</hi> if he could not <hi>preach</hi>
at all? And they are his <hi>Brethren,</hi> who
upon other occaſions do ſuggeſt the moſt
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56909:46"/>
likely Arguments, to prove that <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
was no <hi>eſſential</hi> part of the imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of an <hi>ordinary Presbyter.</hi> They are
the perſons who tell us, that in the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
times Preaching</hi> was looked on as
the <hi>peculiar office</hi> of the <hi>Biſhop.</hi> If ſo,
how could it be any <hi>eſſential part</hi> of the
<hi>duty of ordinary Presbyters?</hi> They tell us,
(I do not ſay Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is one of them)
of the diſtinction between <hi>ruling Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
and thoſe who <hi>laboured in word and
doctrine.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 17.</note> They can never prove that any
of thoſe <hi>Presbyters</hi> were <hi>Laicks,</hi> but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the diſtinction ſeems plainly to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
that ſome of thoſe <hi>Clerical Presbyters</hi>

                  </gap>
was then thought proper. And by this
means it ſhould ſeem that they did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly
contrive the <hi>mutual neceſſity</hi> of
each others <hi>gifts,</hi> for the maintaining
that <hi>Unity of the Spirit,</hi> ſo much inſiſted
on by the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> in his Diſputes againſt
the <hi>diſorders</hi> of the <hi>gifted perſons</hi> of thoſe
times, that <hi>each</hi> might have <hi>ſome</hi> which
might make him uſeful to his <hi>Brethren;</hi>
but that none ſhould have ſo <hi>many</hi> of
them as to diſoblige him from a depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
on the <hi>gifts of others.</hi> And if this
was the <hi>precedent</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtolical Ages,</hi>
how falſe meaſures then do our <hi>Brethren</hi>
take, (who are yet the greateſt Pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of Reverence to the <hi>Scripture-times and
Apoſtolical Precedents</hi>) when they judge
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56909:47"/>
of the <hi>whole Miniſtry</hi> by this <hi>onely</hi> Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Preaching.</hi> But it is eaſie to ſee
what Exigency of their <hi>cauſe</hi> has brought
them, to it. Their great <hi>neglect of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments</hi>
and their <hi>contempt of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,</hi>
and their oppoſition to all that
<hi>power</hi> that can give them <hi>juſtifiable Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
and their Conſciouſneſs how little
their <hi>own Sacraments</hi> can oblige <hi>others</hi> to
adhere to themſelves, who have given ſo
ill <hi>precedents</hi> of deſerting the <hi>Sacraments</hi>
of thoſe who were <hi>originally</hi> their own
<hi>actual and preſent Superiours,</hi> have obliged
them to ſuch <hi>ſlight thoughts</hi> of the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
as if they were the leaſt part of
the Office of a <hi>Miniſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HAVING therefore thus proved,<note place="margin">§ XXXI</note>
that what <hi>power is received</hi> by any <hi>ordained
perſon,</hi> is properly <hi>given</hi> him by the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry</hi>
of his <hi>Ordainers,</hi> I cannot foreſee
what can be further urged againſt my
Argument drawn from the <hi>intention</hi> of
them who gave it, but that taking it with
the <hi>Diſtinctions and Limitations</hi> which I
have made uſe of in managing it, it is
ſuch as any <hi>Law,</hi> or <hi>Equity</hi> either, would
conſider in order to the <hi>validity</hi> of a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance.</hi>
And it is eaſie now to make <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi>
alſo to the <hi>particulars</hi> of the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Hypotheſis,</hi> as I have managed it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:56909:48"/>
To the I. It has been proved, that <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
does not <hi>immediately</hi> reſult from thoſe
<hi>gifts</hi> which onely <hi>qualifie</hi> men for the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of Eccleſiaſtical Offices.</hi> Whence
alſo the <hi>conſequences</hi> do fail, that the <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>
or <hi>not giving</hi> of thoſe <hi>Offices</hi> is to be
proved from the <hi>giving</hi> or <hi>not giving</hi> of
thoſe <hi>gifts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the II. That <hi>gift</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi>
which does indeed immediately inveſt
with <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Power</hi> is diſpoſed of by
<hi>God,</hi> but not <hi>immediately,</hi> but by the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
of the Ordainers,</hi> who do not onely
<hi>declare,</hi> but properly <hi>convey</hi> it.</p>
               <p>To the III. The <hi>gifts</hi> which in the
<hi>Apoſtles</hi> times were <hi>antecedent to Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and which were <hi>judged</hi> of by the <hi>gift</hi>
of <hi>diſcerning of Spirits</hi> in the <hi>Ordainers,</hi>
did not intitle to the <hi>power,</hi> but onely that
<hi>gift</hi> which was <hi>given in Ordination,</hi> which
as to the <hi>eſſentials</hi> of it was not <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,</hi>
(though it might be ſo in regard of
ſome <hi>manifeſtations</hi> of it) and therefore
fit to be expected in all <hi>future genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the IV. Though the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the
<hi>perſon</hi> to be <hi>ordained,</hi> and the <hi>people,</hi> be
onely <hi>acceptance,</hi> yet it has appeared that
the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the <hi>Ordainers</hi> is not <hi>accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>
and <hi>recognition of a power already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:56909:48"/>
but the <hi>conveyance</hi> of a new <hi>power,</hi>
which the <hi>Candidate for Ordination</hi> had
not before he <hi>received</hi> it by virtue of this
<hi>conveyance from them,</hi> becauſe <hi>God</hi> does not
convey it but by their <hi>Miniſtry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the V. The <hi>gifts</hi> deſcribed in the
<hi>Scriptures</hi> were many of them <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,</hi>
in which we are not concerned <hi>now;</hi>
of thoſe that were <hi>ordinary,</hi> all were not
requiſite in each <hi>particular perſon,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<hi>fewer</hi> were requiſite according to
the Diſcipline of <hi>thoſe times,</hi> when <hi>each</hi>
of them laid out themſelves on ſome <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
imployments</hi> than <hi>now,</hi> when each
<hi>particular Miniſter</hi> muſt undertake all the
ſeveral neceſſities of a <hi>Pariſh;</hi> and this
very difference of their Imployments will
make the <hi>Scripture times</hi> uncapable of
being <hi>precedents now,</hi> when the <hi>Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
is ſo much changed from what it
was <hi>then,</hi> and will make many <hi>more</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
by the <hi>qualifications</hi> requiſite <hi>then,</hi>
than can be by thoſe which are required
<hi>now,</hi> all which muſt be owned to be <hi>valid
Miniſters</hi> antecedently to any <hi>humane Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,</hi>
(if our Adverſaries <hi>principles</hi>
hold) though they be not <hi>qualified</hi> for
much the <hi>greateſt part</hi> of that which is
counted the <hi>Miniſterial Imployment</hi> now.
Nor does it appear that the <hi>Scripture</hi> does
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56909:49"/>
oblige us to accept them immediately for
<hi>true Miniſters,</hi> even upon <hi>recognition</hi> of
thoſe <hi>gifts</hi> which are indeed <hi>true qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</hi>
And withall the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are
very far from deſcribing all the <hi>particulars
of power</hi> of our preſent <hi>ordinary Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Offices</hi> with that <hi>likelyhood of deſign</hi> to
do it, and that <hi>diſtinctneſs,</hi> as might in
reaſon have been expected if the <hi>Holy
Ghoſt,</hi> or the <hi>ſacred Writers,</hi> had intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them as a <hi>Charter</hi> for the <hi>extent</hi> of thoſe
<hi>Offices in future Ages.</hi> They do not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
between their <hi>Ordinaries,</hi> which
were to deſcend to their <hi>Succeſſors,</hi> and
their <hi>Extraordinaries,</hi> which were not.
They do not diſtinguiſh between <hi>Pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials,</hi>
which might <hi>validly</hi> be changed
by <hi>acts of humane authority,</hi> and <hi>Immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi>
which might not. They do not <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend</hi>
to any <hi>particulars,</hi> but ſuch as were
occaſioned by the <hi>Diſputes</hi> of that Age.
They do not ſo much as <hi>explain any terms,</hi>
which were then <hi>notorious,</hi> though it
could not be <hi>expected</hi> they ſhould always
be ſo, even to the diſtance of our <hi>preſent
times;</hi> nor have they done any thing
which, upon theſe <hi>principles</hi> might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<hi>litigious Diſputes</hi> concerning <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Subjection,</hi> which no doubt <hi>ſo
good and wiſe a Governour</hi> as <hi>God</hi> would
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56909:49"/>
have done for a <hi>Society,</hi> ſo well beloved
by him as his <hi>Church,</hi> if he had deſigned
her a <hi>written Charter</hi> to appeal to for all
<hi>future Generations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the VI. As it does prove that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
were indeed to be had to the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
for knowing the mind of <hi>God</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
concerning the <hi>extent of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Power,</hi> ſuppoſing the Power it
ſelf were immediately derived from him;
ſo by the ſame proportion of <hi>reaſoning</hi> it
confirms my <hi>argument,</hi> that <hi>recourſe</hi>
ought now to be had to the <hi>intention of
the Ordainers,</hi> ſeeing it has appeared that
<hi>God</hi> is pleaſed not to confer it <hi>actually,</hi> but
by their <hi>mediation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the VII. It thence appears how ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcileable
this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of our <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries</hi>
is with <hi>Government in this life,</hi>
in that it permits perſons to <hi>aſſume Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi>
and to <hi>extend</hi> it as far as they
think fit, by <hi>appealing to writings</hi> againſt
the ſenſe of all the <hi>viſible Authority of this
life,</hi> and this <hi>rationally</hi> by their <hi>principles,</hi>
which let any of themſelves conſider and
explain (if they can) how it is reconcila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
with the <hi>practice</hi> of any <hi>viſible Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon earth.</hi> On the contrary, our
<hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> obliging <hi>inferiour Governours</hi>
to prove their <hi>title</hi> to their <hi>Office,</hi> and the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56909:50"/>
                  <hi>extent</hi> of it, from the <hi>intention</hi> of their
<hi>ſuperiour Governours,</hi> does oblige all to a
ſtrict <hi>dependence</hi> on the <hi>ſupreme viſible pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
ſo as to leave no place for <hi>Appeal</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>practice</hi> of ſuch <hi>Government,</hi>
(which as it laſts onely for <hi>this life,</hi> ſo it
ought not to admit of <hi>Diſputes</hi> more laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
than its <hi>practice</hi>) from them, and that
upon <hi>rational and conſcientious principles.</hi>
For how fallible ſoever they may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to be in <hi>expounding Scriptures,</hi> yet
none can deny them to be the moſt <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
aſwell as the moſt <hi>competent, Judges</hi> of
their own intentions. As certianly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as <hi>God</hi> has made his <hi>Church</hi> a <hi>viſible
Society,</hi> and conſtituted a <hi>viſible Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
in it; ſo certainly it is to be <hi>preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi>
that their <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> muſt be <hi>falſe,</hi>
which by <hi>rational conſequence</hi> does make
it <hi>unpracticable;</hi> and ours <hi>true,</hi> which
does ſo fitly ſecure the <hi>practice</hi> of ſuch <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
by a like <hi>rational conſequence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the VIII. It is in truth very <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent</hi>
to the former <hi>propoſition,</hi> but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
indeed no more <hi>evidence</hi> of its <hi>truth,</hi>
as applied to our <hi>preſent ſubject,</hi> than its
being <hi>conſequential,</hi> it is ſufficiently over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
by what has been ſaid againſt the
<hi>principles</hi> from which it follows. And
this <hi>uſe</hi> may be alſo made further of its
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56909:50"/>
being <hi>conſequential,</hi> that whatever may
be ſaid <hi>againſt it</hi> to prove it <hi>falſe,</hi> will
more ſtrongly <hi>convict the principles</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of <hi>falſhood,</hi> than if it were not ſo
naturally <hi>conſequent</hi> from them. And
let any equal perſon conſider, how any
<hi>Eccleſiaſtical Government</hi> can be <hi>practicable</hi>
on theſe terms. <hi>Subjects</hi> may indeed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
their due <hi>Subordination</hi> to their <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors,</hi>
notwithſtanding their differing
from them in <hi>opinion.</hi> But how can they
preſerve it if they alſo <hi>practiſe</hi> different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?
They may poſſibly do it, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<hi>practices</hi> of <hi>humane infirmity,</hi> and
<hi>diſavowed</hi> by themſelves. But how can
they do it, whileſt they defend their <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes,</hi>
and pretend <hi>Divine Authority</hi> for
them? It is yet harder to reconcile ſuch
<hi>practiſes</hi> as theſe with <hi>Authority.</hi> Yet
they who <hi>diſown their Subjection</hi> in ſome
<hi>ſingular inſtances,</hi> may yet own it in <hi>all</hi>
others. But how is it <hi>poſſible</hi> that they
ſhould <hi>own</hi> it, who do not onely <hi>defend
ſingle practices</hi> different from the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of
their <hi>Superiours,</hi> but pretend to <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Offices</hi> unaccountable to them,
which muſt juſtifie a whole <hi>courſe of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
practices?</hi> Who defend their <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Offices</hi> by ſuch <hi>principles,</hi> as if
they were true muſt in reaſon make
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56909:51"/>
them <hi>unaccountable.</hi> If their <hi>Authority</hi> be
<hi>immediately</hi> received from God, and the
<hi>Rule</hi> of their <hi>practices</hi> be taken from the
<hi>Scriptures</hi> as underſtood by <hi>themſelves;</hi>
what reaſon can there be of <hi>Subjection</hi> to
any <hi>humane Superiours?</hi> As certainly
therefore as all that is <hi>falſe,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys
the <hi>practicableſs of Government;</hi>
as certainly as this Propoſition does <hi>ſo,</hi>
ſo certainly is it <hi>falſe,</hi> and all thoſe other
<hi>antecedent principles</hi> from whence it does
<hi>naturally follow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the IX. The ſame things may be
ſaid, that it is indeed rationally <hi>conſequent</hi>
to the <hi>former,</hi> to juſtifie the <hi>lawfulneſs
and prudence</hi> of differing from <hi>Superiours</hi>
in a <hi>judgment of private diſcretion,</hi> and
conſequently of <hi>differing in practice,</hi> and
that <hi>practice</hi> the <hi>practice</hi> of an <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
where yet it is <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> on ſuch
<hi>principles,</hi> as that a <hi>different judgment</hi> even
of <hi>private diſcretion,</hi> may be allowed as
ſufficient to <hi>defend</hi> ſuch different <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the X. It is the onely <hi>rational way</hi>
of making <hi>Scripture precedents</hi> in ſuch
matters as theſe are, an <hi>obliging Rule</hi> to
our <hi>preſent times,</hi> and <hi>rational</hi> onely on
the <hi>principles</hi> now mentioned. If, on the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56909:51"/>
contrary, <hi>God</hi> give his <hi>authority</hi> by <hi>men,</hi>
then for <hi>prudential caſes</hi> the <hi>commands</hi> of
thoſe <hi>ſame men</hi> ought by the <hi>ſame reaſon</hi> to
be taken for his <hi>commands,</hi> as the <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
given by <hi>them</hi> is taken for his <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
And then theſe being Caſes not to
be expected in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and there
being notwithſtanding a <hi>means</hi> to know
<hi>God</hi>'s <hi>mind</hi> concerning them as far as we
are <hi>concerned</hi> to know it in order to the
<hi>knowledge of our duty,</hi> and there being
withall ſo little reaſon to preſume, that
the <hi>ſacred Writers</hi> or the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to give us any account of <hi>ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi>
they will not find it ſo eaſie as they
think, to prove us <hi>obliged</hi> even by <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
precedent</hi> it ſelf in <hi>ſuch caſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the XI. It is a <hi>conſequence</hi> which it
may be our <hi>Brethren</hi> will not ſtand by,
who when they ſpeak of the <hi>Intereſt of
Presbyters and People,</hi> in <hi>judging</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>gifts</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Candidate,</hi> in order
to their <hi>own acceptance</hi> of him, and ſpeak
of this with a deſign of ſolving the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena
of Government</hi> by it, and of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining
diſorderly perſons from erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>new Churches and Schiſms</hi> at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
will no doubt be <hi>willing</hi> to believe,
that perſons ſo <hi>excluded,</hi> or at leaſt not
<hi>admitted by the Presbyters</hi> or the <hi>People,</hi>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:56909:52"/>
ought in conſcience or modeſty at leaſt
to forbear the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of their <hi>gifts</hi> and
<hi>authority,</hi> till they be ſomewhere <hi>regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
admitted. But how they can <hi>avoid this
conſequence,</hi> admitting this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of
an <hi>immediate call from God,</hi> for my part I
confeſs I cannot underſtand. If they be
ſenſible how inconſiſtent ſuch <hi>diſorderly
practices</hi> as theſe are with <hi>Government,</hi> (as
they ſeem to be when they endeavour,
by this <hi>Intereſt of Churches</hi> in admitting
<hi>gifted perſons,</hi> to prevent the <hi>conſequence</hi>
of ſuch <hi>diſorderly practices</hi>) it will then
concern them ſeriouſly to reflect on their
<hi>principles,</hi> which will <hi>juſtifie practices,</hi>
which themſelves confeſs to be ſo <hi>diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly,</hi>
and will <hi>ruine Government,</hi> for
which themſelves pretend to have at leaſt
ſome little <hi>reverence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I onely obſerve one thing more,<note place="margin">Part 3. c. 9. ſect. 21. p. 92,</note> that
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> tells me, that I have at firſt

the generality of his Brethren themſelves
do not pretend to differ from us in any
thing which even <hi>we call Hereſie?</hi> To
what end is all this, but to make a noiſe
at <hi>a diſtance,</hi> to divert us from the <hi>real de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate?</hi>
Such a one would cavil as he does
about words. What can I think it elſe
but <hi>cavil,</hi> when he pretends himſelf ſo
extremely ignorant in the meaning of the
<hi>Terms</hi> of our <hi>Diſpute?</hi> When he who
has lived all his Life in <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 92.</note> and has
received his <hi>Orders</hi> from a <hi>Biſhop</hi> of the
<hi>Church of England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. ſect. 13. p. 85.</note> is yet to learn what
we in <hi>England,</hi> in our Diſputes with his
Party, mean by the name of <hi>Biſhop;</hi> nay,
even by that of the <hi>Church of England?</hi>
If he thought himſelf in earneſt as <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:56909:54"/>
as he pretends, why would he med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
in Diſputes where he does not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the <hi>Terms?</hi> If he <hi>knows</hi> better
things, what <hi>charity</hi> can excuſe him from
the charge of <hi>Inſincerity?</hi> Though <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi>
may, yet <hi>cauſes</hi> cannot <hi>aequivocate.</hi>
There is but <hi>one ſenſe</hi> of all <hi>Terms,</hi> which
<hi>cauſes</hi> oblige men to mean, and that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one <hi>ought</hi> to know who pretends to
<hi>skill in cauſes.</hi> Other ſenſes I did not
think my ſelf obliged to take notice of in
Terms of <hi>notorious ſignification,</hi> till I found
ſome occaſion for it from the miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings
of my Adverſaries. But there
is one thing that looks moſt like an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Self-conviction,</hi> which though it
has been taken up by perſons of worſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
than <hi>he,</hi> yet does withall run through
the Reaſoning of ſeveral of the later
Books of Mr. <hi>Baxter;</hi> that is, that <hi>our
Clergie</hi> muſt alone be reſponſible for all
the <hi>ſcandals</hi> that any <hi>Clergie,</hi> who never
had any affinity with <hi>ours,</hi> but that of
their <hi>common office,</hi> were ever guilty of.
What is this but in effect to acknowledge
that ours are the onely <hi>real Clergie?</hi>
What is it but to acknowledge the <hi>conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs</hi>
of thoſe <hi>Arguments,</hi> which have
been uſed by me to diſprove the Title of
their Miniſters to the Office of <hi>real Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie-men?</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:56909:54"/>
If they thought their <hi>own</hi> to
be <hi>Clergie-men,</hi> why will they not be
as obnoxious to all the <hi>ſcandals</hi> they can
rake of <hi>Clergie-men</hi> out of the <hi>Hiſtories</hi> of
<hi>Sixteen hundred</hi> Years, as <hi>ours?</hi> I wiſh I
could by this Suggeſtion make them ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of the <hi>diſingenuity</hi> they ſhew in this
way of Reaſoning, and of the <hi>miſchief</hi>
they do <hi>themſelves</hi> and the common cauſe
of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> It is ſtrange if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
can ever expect to revive <hi>Parochial Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline</hi>
by ſuch means as theſe, of ruining
<hi>Dioceſan.</hi> Can he ever expect to prevail
with thoſe <hi>irreligious Laicks,</hi> who are on
this occaſion ſo ready to make uſe of this
miſguided zeal of his Brethren, not as
more <hi>orthodox</hi> than others, but as a <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
party,</hi> to ſubmit themſelves to the
Cenſures of his <hi>Parochial Miniſters,</hi> when
he teaches them to deſpiſe an <hi>Authority</hi>
ſo much more <hi>venerable</hi> than theirs, on
all the accounts which Mankind owns for
juſt <hi>reaſons of veneration?</hi> Can he in
earneſt hope, than an upſtart <hi>Authority
of Innovators,</hi> too late to have their Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals
traced through any diſtant <hi>Hiſtories,</hi>
can procure <hi>reverence</hi> with them, who
are told ſuch vile things of thoſe, who
upon the firſt diviſion were found <hi>poſſeſſed</hi>
of an <hi>Authority</hi> ſo much more received
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56909:55"/>
by a <hi>peaceable</hi> as well as a <hi>juſt preſcription?</hi>
Can he expect that he can <hi>preſerve</hi> that
<hi>Authority in Inferiours,</hi> which he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to <hi>ruine</hi> in their <hi>Superiours?</hi> Can
he think to <hi>preſerve</hi> it in thoſe, whom it
ſeems <hi>himſelf</hi> dares not own for <hi>Clergie-men,</hi>
whileſt he teaches them to aſperſe
the very <hi>name</hi> as well as the <hi>authority</hi> of
<hi>Clergie-men?</hi> Can he think to <hi>preſerve</hi> it
in thoſe, who have no other but <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
ways</hi> of pretending to a <hi>Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi>
or to pretend <hi>Charters</hi> expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by themſelves in their own favour,
when he teaches them to <hi>undervalue an
Authority,</hi> derived by all the ways by
which it is reaſonable to expect an <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
ſhould be derived at ſuch a diſtance?
Can he expect in the <hi>age</hi> we live in, that
the <hi>great ones</hi> will ever be induced to pay
reſpect to the <hi>inferiour Clergie,</hi> who are
ſo unknown to our <hi>Laws,</hi> when they are
taught to deny it to thoſe, who have as
good a Title even to <hi>legal honours</hi> as
themſelves? Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> may poſſibly
<hi>ruine</hi> us, if God ſhould grant him the
curſe of a ſucceſs on his preſent Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours;
but I cannot for my life conceive
how he can <hi>ſettle</hi> us, or really <hi>reform our
lives,</hi> or reſtore <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> on ſuch Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
as theſe. True <hi>Latitudinarianiſm</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:56909:55"/>
does onely tend to introduce <hi>Scepticiſm</hi>
into the <hi>minds,</hi> and <hi>Libertiniſm</hi> into the
<hi>lives</hi> of Men. God deliver us from an
<hi>experiment</hi> of his Projects, and him from
the diſſatisfaction of a <hi>fruitleſs repentance,</hi>
when he cannot <hi>remedy</hi> us.</p>
               <p>THIS is all which I think fit to ſay at

            </p>
            <p>Here are two Parts.</p>
            <p>

Government thereof.</p>
            <p>This proved by theſe two degrees:</p>
            <p>1. That the ſuppoſition, of their being <hi>leſs
ſecure of Salvation</hi> out of this Epiſcopal
Communion than in it, is ſufficient to prove
them <hi>obliged</hi> to ſubmit to all terms, not <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly

ſinful,</hi> however <hi>unexpedient,</hi> rather

to be <hi>excluded,</hi> from this Communion.
<hi>Ch. I. §</hi> 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
            <p>2. That there is indeed <hi>leſs ſecurity</hi> of
Salvation to be had even on performance of
the <hi>moral conditions</hi> of Salvation, <hi>out</hi> of
this Epiſcopal Communion than <hi>in</hi> it.</p>
            <p>This proved from two things:</p>
            <p>(1.) That they cannot be ſo <hi>well aſſured</hi>
of their Salvation in the uſe of <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi>

being left to <hi>extraordinaries</hi> is a condition

at preſent,</hi> whatever it may
prove <hi>hereafter. Ch. II.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2.) That theſe <hi>ordinary means</hi> of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation

            </p>
            <p>This proved from four things.</p>
            <p>1. We cannot be <hi>aſſured</hi> that God will do
for us what is neceſſary for our Salvation on

            <p>3. The onely <hi>ordinary means,</hi> by which

            </p>
            <p>4. The participation in theſe <hi>external

I ſhould be more thankful for your
<hi>Approbation</hi> or your <hi>Reproof,</hi> both of
them being in their kind ſo uſeful, and
both of them being performed by you
with ſo great Civility. I am confident
that if our modern Diſputes had been
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56909:59"/>
moderated with that <hi>candour,</hi> men would
certainly have been more <hi>peaceful,</hi> and
very probably more <hi>orthodox,</hi> than now
we find them. I could very heartily have

as the onely Circumſtance that can make
ſuch differences grievous to a <hi>pious perſon.</hi>
For as for thoſe others which exaſperate
many, that Diſſenters are not ſo wiſe as

that upon a view of the <hi>particulars</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in your Letter, I find my ſelf to be
ſo very innocent. For as for my <hi>Preface,</hi>
the main deſigns driven on in it are, that
<hi>diſreſpect</hi> to the <hi>Clergie</hi> is ſhewn to have
been an Introductory to the <hi>Atheiſm</hi> of
the Age we live in; that the <hi>conformable
Clergie,</hi> that is, ſuch as would anſwer the
<hi>deſign</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> not onely as to their
<hi>exteriour demeanour</hi> in publick ſolomen
Aſſemblies, but alſo as to the <hi>qualifications</hi>
of their <hi>perſons,</hi> and the conduct of their

in their <hi>Preaching,</hi> or <hi>ſcandalous</hi> in
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56909:60"/>
their <hi>Examples;</hi> and therefore that the
<hi>Church</hi> is not reſponſible for their miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours
where they prove otherwiſe;
and that the <hi>Laity</hi> are in their proportion
obliged to the ſame duties with the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,</hi>
and therefore may make uſe of the
Advice there preſcribed; or to touch at
the <hi>errors</hi> of our <hi>modern School-Divinity,</hi>
are touched, and to make ſome propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals
for their <hi>reformation.</hi> In theſe things
I can ſee no occaſion of offence, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſome Preſervatives againſt it. The
onely thing I ſuppoſe you aim at is, my
taxing ſome Opinions of <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi>
(and that with as little <hi>perſonal</hi> reflection
as I was able) which I conceived prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
to <hi>Church Authority,</hi> which Opinions
becauſe you ſeem to diſown, I do not ſee
how you ſhould apprehend your ſelf as
particularly concerned in what is there
ſaid; eſpecially there being nothing in
the diſcourſe whereby you could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
either your <hi>ſelf,</hi> or any of your <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
temper,</hi> to have been intended, I
aſſure you I intended none but ſuch as
were <hi>guilty,</hi> and with being ſo I charged
none <hi>particularly.</hi> But that not onely the
<hi>old Puritans and Separatiſts</hi> of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>'s
times, &amp;c. but alſo very many
of <hi>ours</hi> now are guilty of them, is too
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56909:60"/>
notorious to ſuppoſe you ignorant of it.
I could heartily wiſh that the number of
<hi>better principled</hi> and more <hi>peaceable</hi> Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were greater than I fear it is. Nor
do I ſee that what is there ſaid can make
it unuſeful, even to the perſons truly
concerned, that value <hi>truth</hi> more than
any, however beloved <hi>party.</hi> Seeing it
may let them ſee the evil <hi>conſequence</hi> of
their <hi>principles,</hi> and their influence on
that <hi>Atheiſm and Prophanneſs,</hi> which I
am confident themſelves do moſt cordial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deteſt, which I conceived to be more
likely to prevail with them than any
other Arguments, as being more ſuited
to their <hi>pious diſpoſition.</hi> Or, ſuppoſing
that my fears were indeed groundleſs of
the Introduction of <hi>prophanneſs</hi> by the
<hi>contempt of Government,</hi> or of <hi>contempt of
Government</hi> by their <hi>diſobedience</hi> to it;
yet might it at leaſt warn them from
<hi>confining</hi> on ſuch dangerous <hi>conſequences,</hi>
or from coming to them <hi>unawares,</hi> by an
abuſe of <hi>principles</hi> generally true, but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to particular inconveniences,
when unwarily managed. I mean, it
may put them in mind of the greater
Momentouſneſs of <hi>good Government,</hi> and
of <hi>Peace,</hi> than of many other differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and conſequently of the great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56909:61"/>
incumbent on them for their
preſervation. Whence they would fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
find themſelves obliged, ſo to oppoſe
the particular <hi>abuſive</hi> Conſtitutions of
<hi>Governours,</hi> as not to bring their <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>

which your ſelf, I believe, would wiſh
redreſſed in the cauſes of our <hi>Church-divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</hi>
But if that part of my Diſcourſe
could not be <hi>uſeful,</hi> yet could it not be
<hi>prejudicial</hi> to them, nothing being urged
either <hi>invectively or imperiouſly,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

to me; eſpecially as to the Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you make againſt it. For if it were
impoſſible to maintain <hi>Diſcipline</hi> under a

it would follow, that the <hi>Secular Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi>
under a <hi>Secular Monarch</hi> of any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56909:61"/>
were impoſſible alſo to be obſerved.
Your ſame <hi>reaſons</hi> will proceed as ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
here, as where you apply them. For
it is every way as impoſſible for any ſuch
Prince to have a <hi>particular cognizance</hi> of
every <hi>particular cauſe,</hi> much more of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>particular perſon</hi> in his <hi>Dominions,</hi> as
for a <hi>Biſhop</hi> in his <hi>Dioceſe.</hi> As therefore
it appears by experience (I ſhall inſtance
a <hi>Scripture-example</hi> becauſe I know that
will be liable to leaſt exception) that
<hi>David</hi> (in an <hi>extent</hi> more <hi>vaſt,</hi> and a <hi>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
more <hi>numerous,</hi> than that of the <hi>largeſt
Dioceſe,</hi> 120 miles in length, and 60

1300000 Men fit for <hi>war,</hi> beſides <hi>Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi>

inſpection</hi> into all <hi>cauſes,</hi> or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of his power to numerous <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
Presbyteries.</hi> So I do not ſee why
it may not hold as well for a <hi>poſſibility of
Diſcipline</hi> under an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Monarch</hi>
of a much <hi>narrower extent.</hi> For the <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
produced by you ſeems to proceed
from the <hi>nature of Government in general,</hi>
and therefore muſt proceed with the

               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:56909:62"/>
there being no ingredient peculiarly rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to <hi>Religion,</hi> much leſs to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi>
which might alter the caſe, or argue a
<hi>diſparity.</hi> For certainly <hi>Princes</hi> as well
as <hi>Biſhops</hi> are reſponſible for the miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of their <hi>particular Subjects,</hi> as far as
they may be prevented by their <hi>moral di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence;</hi>
and yet you will not thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that every <hi>particular</hi> muſt come
under his immediate <hi>perſonal</hi> care and
cognizance; nor is it proved, that the
<hi>Biſhop</hi> is otherwiſe obliged to ſuch a care
upon <hi>peculiar reſpects.</hi> Beſides that, it is
plainly againſt <hi>experience</hi> even in <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticals:</hi>
for as it hath fallen out in ſome
places where there were many Cities,
that the <hi>Biſhops</hi> were proportionably
multiplied, as in <hi>Africa and Ireland;</hi> ſo
that it was not upon account of the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility</hi>
of the managing the charge of

that even in the very ſame places the

And particularly I have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed

               <p>Introduction. § 1. Quest. 1. Whether the
Biſhop be bound to diſcharge his whole
duty in his own perſon? Or, Whether
he may not take in the aſſiſtance of
others? That he may, granted by Mr.
Baxter. Quest. 2. waved by me. § 2.
Mr. Baxter's reaſons do as ſolidly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
a poſſibility of Secular Diſcipline
under a Secular Monarch, of a Precinct
as large as a Dioceſe, as of Dioceſan
Diſcipline. § 3. Secular Monarchs as
well reſponſible for the miſcarriage of
particular Subjects as Biſhops, and their
charge is as great. The Perſons, Crimes,
and Laws, belonging to the care of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Governour more numerous than
they which belong to the Eccleſiaſtical.
§ 4, 5. So are the neceſſities to be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for by the Secular Governour. § 6,
7, 8. An Objection prevented. § 9.
Mr. Baxter's firſt anſwer refuted. The
Government of a Dioceſe may be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred
without any more than three Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56909:65"/>
§ 10. The Church may for pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential
reaſons conſtitute new Officers,
though not Orders. § 11. Mr. Baxter's
ſecond anſwer refuted. Perſonal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
as requiſite in a Prince as in a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop.
§ 12. An Objection prevented.
§ 13. Mr. Baxter's third, fourth, and
fifth anſwers refuted. § 14, 15. His
ſixth anſwer rejected. § 16. What I
mean when I make the decretory power
of Government proper to the Supreme,
and the executive onely to be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to inferiour Governours. § 17.
The decretory power of Government
does not neceſſarily include perſonal or
particular Exploration. § 18, 19. His

Diſpute, whether a Patriarch or Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop

I had ſaid ſomething.</q> Which

no <hi>Biſhop</hi> undertaking the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular

            </p>
            <p>For by <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> I ſuppoſe, we mean
nothing but <hi>good Laws punctually executed,</hi>

without <hi>good Laws</hi> or <hi>punctual Execution,</hi>

But becauſe I find by ſome of your other

of Diſcipline</hi> under a <hi>Dioceſan Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>

ſo that it may not be ſafe to take

at preſent I am willing to undertake,
(that I may not enlarge beyond neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
is the Examination of your Anſwers
to the Reaſons produced in my former
Letter. My firſt Reaſon is therefore for
proving the <hi>poſſibility of Diſcipline</hi> under
a <hi>Monarchical Dioceſan,</hi> in the ſenſe there
and here already explain'd (which I could
gladly wiſh you would keep in mind for
preventing <hi>miſunderſtandings</hi> on your
part, and unneceſſary <hi>repetitions</hi> on mine)
was, that your Reaſons being not drawn
from <hi>teſtimony,</hi> or any <hi>poſitive and peculiar
preſcriptions,</hi> which might make the caſe
<hi>ſingular;</hi> but from <hi>reaſon,</hi> and that not
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:56909:69"/>
particularly drawn from the nature of
<hi>Government</hi> as <hi>Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> but general,
from the <hi>principles of Government</hi> as ſuch)
will proceed as ſtrongly againſt the <hi>poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of Secular Diſcipline</hi> under a <hi>Secular,</hi>
as <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> under an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch.</hi>
Seeing therefore that in a <hi>Secular
Monarchy</hi> as abſolute as the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi>
we ſpeak of, and as remote from a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of a cognizance of all <hi>particulars,</hi>
and of a much larger <hi>extent</hi> than any
<hi>Dioceſe, Secular Diſcipline</hi> may notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
be preſerved: it muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that no <hi>Reaſons</hi> of this kind can
prove it impoſſible under ſuch an <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
Monarchy,</hi> as is the ſubject of our
preſent Diſcourſe. Nay, as it hence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<hi>poſſible,</hi> not onely upon <hi>particular</hi>
accounts, but <hi>ſimply,</hi> as having been <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi>
performed under <hi>Secular Monarchies:</hi>
So it muſt upon theſe <hi>principles</hi> be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
<hi>actually</hi> performable in <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals,</hi>
which will not onely evince the

of the <hi>contrary aſſertion.</hi> In this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
you ſeem to grant (what is alſo
proved in my Letter from the Inſtance of

that what agrees to <hi>other</hi> Forms of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
upon the like general accounts,

are ſo clear, that as I do not
perceive that what you ſay tends to the
denyal of it, ſo I do not think it worth my
time to prove it. The only thing therefore
remaining, which you ſeem to queſtion in
your Anſwer is, that the <hi>Reaſons</hi> produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by you proceed on Principles peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
to Eccleſiaſtical Government as ſuch.
For your principal endeavour is to ſhew
a diſparity, why, though <hi>Secular Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi>
be indeed maintainable under a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Monarchy,</hi> yet <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> muſt
not be preſumed to be ſo under an <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical.</hi>
For which you refer me to my
Lord <hi>Bacon;</hi> and your own <hi>Letter</hi> to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovicus
Molinaeus,</hi> beſides what you add
to that purpoſe in your preſent Letter.
For the very ſuppoſal of a <hi>Diſparity</hi> does
neceſſarily proceed on <hi>peculiar</hi> Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
and is directly repugnant to the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56909:70"/>
notion of general and common Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
Now to let you underſtand that
your <hi>Reaſons</hi> do indeed proceed on <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
common to all Government</hi> of the
ſame <hi>number of perſons</hi> and <hi>extent of place,</hi>
as that of the <hi>largeſt</hi> of our <hi>Dioceſes, Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi>

thoſe Topicks of <hi>duty;</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

that ſuch <hi>precedents</hi> will not encreaſe the

If we ſtill further conſider, how

of natural Laws,</hi> and ſo reducible to
the forementioned conſideration; how
many of them that are <hi>poſitive</hi> concern
the <hi>Jews,</hi> not as a <hi>Church,</hi> but as a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth;</hi>
how all of them that concern
them as a <hi>Church,</hi> are now evacuated by
that <hi>Evangelical Liberty,</hi> which has abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
the <hi>Moſaick Authority,</hi> from which
they derived their Sanction; how, even
of the New Teſtament <hi>preſcriptions,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
are onely <hi>proviſional,</hi> and onely
grounded on <hi>temporary reaſons,</hi> and thoſe
ſuch as are not ſuitable to our <hi>preſent

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56909:75"/>
               <hi>Martha</hi> was troubled about many things.
For <hi>Religion</hi> teaches us an <hi>indifferency</hi> as

will prove ſufficient, for <hi>direction</hi> onely,
not for <hi>coertion:</hi> for the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells
us, that the <hi>Law</hi> is not for the righteous.
And as the <hi>Neceſſities</hi> are thus certainly
<hi>fewer</hi> in perſons of an eminent <hi>perfection</hi>
in Religion, ſo the <hi>means</hi> of bringing
them to that <hi>perfection</hi> are <hi>fewer and eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
than thoſe of a <hi>ſecular converſation;</hi> it
being much eaſier to curb our <hi>own deſires,</hi>

<hi>Religion</hi> much more effectually uniting

<hi>nouriſhment,</hi> or vicious <hi>educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
The <hi>oeconomical</hi> charge of Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
does require more <hi>care</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<hi>attendance</hi> of the <hi>Nurſe</hi> than is ever

               <hi>Miniſter.</hi> Yet certainly you would not
think your own Argument good if I
ſhould apply it here. If the <hi>nurſing</hi> of
<hi>one child</hi> take up the whole time of <hi>one
perſon,</hi> then what <hi>one perſon</hi> can be able
to govern as <hi>many children</hi> as are in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<hi>Families?</hi> And if this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

to one perſon,</hi> then much more that
of a <hi>Family,</hi> of a <hi>Corporation,</hi> of a <hi>City,</hi> of
a <hi>Province, &amp;c.</hi> And if to avoid this you
reply, that although every <hi>Maſter of a
family</hi> be not able <hi>perſonally</hi> to diſcharge
the duty of governing <hi>many children,</hi> yet
he can by his <hi>authority</hi> oblige the <hi>Nurſes
and Tutors</hi> to do their duty, and ſo at
leaſt <hi>mediately</hi> govern them; (as the
<hi>King,</hi> though he cannot poſſibly be <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally</hi>

as that they who come under his more

the caſe be not exactly the ſame here:

eſpecially conſidering that the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of a <hi>Biſhop</hi> over his <hi>Clergie,</hi> is onely
<hi>in general</hi> to ſee that they do their duty,
and does not require ſo <hi>particular an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection</hi>
into their performances, as that
of a <hi>Miniſter</hi> over his <hi>Pariſhioners.</hi> For
it is much eaſier for a <hi>Biſhop</hi> to inform

the duty of his <hi>Cure,</hi> whether of <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
or <hi>Praying,</hi> or <hi>Viſiting,</hi> and whether
he be of a <hi>good repute,</hi> or at leaſt not

               <q>Your 1. is, that

by the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> which therefore
alloweth variety and mutations of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour

the ſtanding of the Clergy is by

that <hi>men</hi> may not alter them, or

force of this Anſwer, as far as I can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend

things; 1. That the <hi>government</hi> of a <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſe</hi>

than <hi>three Orders,</hi> for thoſe <hi>three,</hi> you

the three already eſtabliſhed,
though it be in the power of the <hi>State</hi> to

is ſo manifeſtly falſe, as that if ever
<hi>Diſcipline</hi> were obſerved ever ſince the

(which is hard to deny, ſince it has been
<hi>Dioceſan</hi> as far as <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory</hi>
can inform us) it was under theſe three
<hi>Orders.</hi> Nay, the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> pretend
their <hi>Claſſical Diſcipline</hi> to be maintainable
by <hi>one Order</hi> alone, for <hi>Deaconſhip</hi> they
make onely a kind of <hi>civil office</hi> for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing

in an <hi>Aſsembly,</hi> without any diſtinction

the <hi>Preſident</hi> of theſe <hi>Presbyteries,</hi> though
not of a <hi>diſtinct Order,</hi> as moſt of the

cannot underſtand. The ground, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
of your miſtake is, that in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration

<hi>Orders,</hi> becauſe they have different <hi>duties</hi>
in the <hi>ſubordination</hi> of the <hi>policy</hi> of the

you know better than I can tell you, that
even <hi>Dioceſan Government,</hi> as <hi>Dioceſan,</hi>
may and has been actually adminiſtred
without them in the <hi>primitive times.</hi>
Some of them being of <hi>civil</hi> conſtitution,
for adminiſtring the power of the <hi>Prince</hi>
in the <hi>exteriour government</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi>
as he is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, (that I may uſe

and all of them of <hi>prudential</hi> uſe, onely
<hi>convenient,</hi> not ſimply <hi>neceſſary,</hi> even in
the opinion of them that uſe them. And
2. You cannot pretend, that the addition
of new <hi>Officers</hi> (though poſſibly <hi>unlawful</hi>
upon other accounts, yet) ſhould make
the Diſcipline of a <hi>populous precinct</hi> leſs,
but rather more maintainable. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
in ſuch a caſe the <hi>multitude of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi>
is an advantage. And let me intreat
you to remember that this is the real
queſtion, not Whether <hi>Dioceſan Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
be conſtituted by God, but Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

But, 3. Suppoſe it as inconvenient as you

pleaſe, even for the maintainance of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline,</hi>

And how can they be excuſed, even in
ſuch a caſe, for refuſing <hi>paſſive obedience;</hi>
for ſeparating from them, and joyning
with Parties formed <hi>in oppoſition</hi> to them?
Which ſeems to be your caſe in ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

all theſe <hi>prudential Offices Orders,</hi> ſo there
is no reaſon why we <hi>ſhould</hi> do ſo in the
<hi>Eccleſiaſtical notion</hi> of the word. For not
now to make uſe of that diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

as <hi>yours</hi> is would have eaſily defended us
againſt it, if it had been objected by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Adverſary. And if I might be ſo
bold, I would humbly beg you not to
exerciſe your <hi>wit,</hi> in bringing needleſs
and weak Arguments <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> but
onely to inſiſt on ſuch as are in your own
judgment <hi>convictive.</hi> For certainly if
you had but curſorily <hi>reflected</hi> on this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
you would readily have diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that this is ſo far from being a <hi>diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
as that indeed (if it prove any thing)
it will proceed with as much force againſt
the <hi>poſſibility of Secular Diſcipline</hi> under a
<hi>Civil Government</hi> of the ſame <hi>extent</hi> with
a <hi>Dioceſe.</hi> For may it not as well be urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
againſt the power of <hi>Delegation</hi> in a
Prince, that either it muſt be his <hi>own
work</hi> that is delegated by him, or ſome
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56909:85"/>
other? If that which is properly <hi>his own,</hi>
then he muſt either make <hi>many Princes,</hi>
(which were directly deſtructive to his
<hi>Monarchical Government</hi>) or elſe he who
is <hi>no Prince</hi> may do a <hi>Prince</hi>'s work, and
then what need of a <hi>Prince?</hi> Beſides
that, your pretended Contradiction will
proceed with as much force <hi>here</hi> as in the
<hi>Church.</hi> Conſider, I pray, what you
would anſwer in behalf of a <hi>Secular Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,</hi>
and ſee whether it will not be
equally appliable to that which is <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical.</hi>
I believe your ſelf would deny,
that every <hi>inferiour Officer,</hi> who is <hi>delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
to do the <hi>Prince</hi>'s work, is thereby
made a <hi>Prince,</hi> ſeeing that though he do
exert the ſame power, yet he does not do
it <hi>adequatly</hi> (ſome Acts of <hi>grace</hi> being ſtill
reſerved to the <hi>Prince's perſon</hi> incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicably;)
or if <hi>adequately,</hi> yet at leaſt not
<hi>independently,</hi> all other <hi>Officers</hi> being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the <hi>ſupreme.</hi> For theſe two are
the <hi>formal conſtitutives</hi> of a <hi>Prince's power</hi>
as ſuch; ſo that they who want them,
how many ſoever of his <hi>commands are exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,</hi>
or how much ſoever of his <hi>power is
adminiſtred</hi> by them, will not therefore
prove <hi>formal Princes.</hi> Beſides that, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
theſe Principles it may be affirmed,
that though the <hi>Prince</hi> may indeed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:56909:85"/>
others in all the Services of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth;</hi>
yet it does not thence neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
follow, that he <hi>delegates</hi> that which
is properly his <hi>own work.</hi> For to do all
things himſelf is ſo far from being his
<hi>proper,</hi> as that it is <hi>none</hi> of his <hi>work</hi> as a
<hi>Prince,</hi> but onely to take care that the
ſupreme <hi>Officers</hi> entruſted <hi>under him</hi> do
their <hi>duty,</hi> and to <hi>puniſh</hi> them in caſe of
default; ſo that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>irreſponſible
power,</hi> is that which is <hi>proper</hi> to him, and
which if it be communicated to <hi>others,</hi>
muſt make <hi>them</hi> alſo <hi>Princes;</hi> and this
care of obliging <hi>others</hi> to the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of their <hi>duties</hi> is ſo inſeparable a
<hi>Royalty</hi> of the <hi>Supreme Power,</hi> as that
thoſe <hi>Princes</hi> who have entruſted <hi>others</hi>
with it, have been judged by all prudent
perſons <hi>Princes</hi> onely <hi>in name,</hi> not <hi>in effect,</hi>
as <hi>Chilperick of France, Sardanapalus, &amp;c.</hi>
This <hi>proper work</hi> therefore of the <hi>Prince</hi>
being reſerved to himſelf incommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
it will plainly appear that this <hi>Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
will not ſuperſede the neceſſity of
the <hi>ſupreme Monarch;</hi> and that there will
be no contradiction in the caſe, the <hi>infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Officers</hi> ſtill remaining <hi>Subjects,</hi> not
<hi>Princes,</hi> notwithſtanding whatſoever <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation</hi>
that does not make them <hi>abſolute</hi>
and <hi>unaccountable,</hi> and <hi>unobnoxious</hi> to the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:56909:86"/>
               <hi>care and cognizance</hi> of the <hi>Supreme.</hi> The
Application to our preſent caſe is eaſily
made. For when I mentioned the <hi>Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi>
of the <hi>Biſhops power</hi> to particular
<hi>Parochians,</hi> I onely meant ſuch a <hi>ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
power</hi> for <hi>governing</hi> their reſpective
<hi>Pariſhes,</hi> as <hi>Viceroys and Lieutenants</hi> have
under <hi>Secular Monarchs</hi> for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of particular <hi>Provinces;</hi> but this
<hi>ſubordinate power</hi> is ſo far from being the
<hi>proper work</hi> of a <hi>Biſhop</hi> as ſuch, as that it
would make him <hi>no Biſhop</hi> to ſuppoſe it
in him at all. That therefore which is
<hi>proper</hi> to a <hi>Biſhop</hi> as ſuch, that is, the
power of <hi>compelling the Parochians</hi> to the
performance of their duties, is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to any <hi>Parochian;</hi> and when
it has been communicated to any <hi>ſimple
Presbyters,</hi> it has been counted as great
an <hi>effeminacy</hi> and betraying of their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
as the like caſe in <hi>Seculars</hi> was reputed
in the <hi>Secular Princes</hi> now mentioned.
For this was the occaſion of the Aboliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Co-epiſcopi</hi> about the ninth <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury,</hi>
that the <hi>Biſhops</hi> made uſe of them
as pretences for their own ſloth in the
performance of their own duties. If
therefore any thing of this kind have
crept in in the <hi>later ages,</hi> I will not defend
it; but onely ſhall deſire you to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:56909:86"/>
that it is not pertinent to your deſign
of making all <hi>Presbyters</hi> as ſuch, without
any ſuch particular <hi>deputation,</hi> equal with
them; and that your Arguments, if they
proved any thing, are more directly le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
againſt <hi>Dioceſan Epiſcopacy</hi> as ſuch,
without any ſuch <hi>abuſive deputation.</hi>

ſhew, that that <hi>power</hi> which is by the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi>
permitted to <hi>Pariſh Miniſters,</hi> does
not make them <hi>Biſhops,</hi> nor make them
who are ſo <hi>properly</hi> unneceſſary; which
methinks your ſelf might eaſily have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
if you had but reflected on
what your ſelf know concerning its <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi>
among us, without ſuch <hi>dilemmatical
uncertainties,</hi> which would make one
think you a ſtranger to it. The other
member of your <hi>dilemma</hi> you do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute,
whether becauſe you forgot it, or
that you thought it of it ſelf ſufficiently
evident, I know not; I ſuppoſe your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
would have been, that if the
<hi>power</hi> delegated by the <hi>Biſhop</hi> to the <hi>infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Clergy</hi> were none of his <hi>own,</hi> then he
could not <hi>delegate</hi> it, ſeeing that none can
juſtly diſpoſe of that which is <hi>not his own.</hi>
To this the Anſwer is eaſie, from the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
<hi>power of Princes</hi> already inſiſted on,
that this <hi>power</hi> is the <hi>Biſhops</hi> the ſame
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:56909:87"/>
way as that of <hi>inferiour Magiſtrates</hi> is the
<hi>ſupreme Prince's,</hi> not to be <hi>executed</hi> by his

his <hi>election and cenſures,</hi> which is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

obſerved to be a Conceſſion of all that I
pretended to prove, that a <hi>Biſhop</hi> with
<hi>inferiour Church-rulers</hi> can govern a ſcope
as large as a <hi>Dioceſe.</hi> But when in appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of it to our purpoſe you ask,
<q>Whether it follows, that our <hi>Church-Monarch</hi>

without any Suboverſeers, or rule them
(by Gods Word on the Conſcience)
without any <hi>Subrulers.</hi>
               </q> I wonder that
you ſhould ſeem ſo to forget the practice
of our <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>ruling our Pariſhes</hi> as
<hi>Subrulers</hi> under the <hi>Biſhop.</hi> It may be
your meaning is, that our <hi>Pariſh Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi>
were not allowed a part in the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Government</hi> of their <hi>Churches,</hi> as if
that were ſufficient to deny the name of
proper <hi>Church-rulers.</hi> But you might
have remembred, 1. That my deſire
was, that the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> as in S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> time
ſo now, would more communicate their
affairs of any conſiderable importance
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:56909:87"/>
with their <hi>Presbytery.</hi> And, 2. That even
according to the <hi>Rubricks</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi>
the <hi>Pariſh Miniſter or Curate</hi> is allowed
the power, not onely of <hi>diſſuading,</hi> (which
yet is all that is allowed the <hi>Church</hi>
by ſeveral of our <hi>Nonconforming Brethren</hi>)
but alſo of <hi>hindering notorious ill livers and
uncharitable perſons</hi> from the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
onely with a proviſion that they <hi>ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie</hi>
ſuch their proceedings to the <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
within fourteen days at the furtheſt,
which was no more than neceſſary for

would make one wonder at your

of the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Courts</hi> in this
affair, if the <hi>Clergy</hi> could be perſuaded to
be unanimous and vigorous in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of their duty. And, 3. As it is
plain that there are many <hi>Subrulers</hi> under
<hi>Princes,</hi> who are not of their <hi>Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil;</hi>
ſo you cannot therefore conclude
the <hi>Pariſh Miniſters</hi> not to be <hi>Subrulers</hi>
under the <hi>Biſhop</hi> even now, becauſe all

by their <hi>Council.</hi> Nay, 4. Your ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
<hi>Legiſlation</hi> it ſelf to be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

            <p>WHEN I deſcribed the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical
Monarchy</hi> I ſpoke of,<note place="margin">§ XVII</note> to be ſuch as does
appropriate the <hi>decretory power of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
to it, <hi>communicating</hi> onely the <hi>exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive</hi>
to others, you bid me <hi>hold to that.</hi>
What your meaning is thereby I do not
know; for neither do you ſeem to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade
me to hold to it as <hi>truth,</hi> ſeeing you
afterwards ſeem to diſlike it. Nor can I
think that you would have me to hold to
an <hi>error,</hi> that you might have advantage
of diſputing againſt me. What you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
againſt a mere <hi>Executioner</hi>'s being
no <hi>Governour,</hi> might eaſily have been
prevented, if you had conſidered that the

the <hi>executive</hi> power was by me oppoſed
to that which is <hi>decretory,</hi> that is, which
is <hi>abſolute,</hi> and <hi>unaccountable</hi> to any <hi>Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
on earth,</hi> at leaſt within ſuch <hi>limits.</hi>
Which as it may include much more
power than that which your ſelf call <hi>more
than executive,</hi> that of <hi>reproving, exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
convincing, &amp;c.</hi> So that <hi>decretory</hi> in
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56909:88"/>
this ſenſe can agree to a <hi>ſubject,</hi> I believe
your ſelfe will hardly affirm. And indeed
if you had been pleaſed to follow the <hi>ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi>
in the <hi>civil power,</hi> where I do not
find you ſo ſcrupulous in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> you
would more clearly have underſtood my
meaning, and its <hi>unconcernedneſs</hi> in your
Exceptions. For in <hi>civils,</hi> at leaſt the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretory
power</hi> (from whence all <hi>Laws and

and to which all <hi>appeals,</hi> in caſe of
difficulty in their ſenſe or partiality of

I believe be owned by your ſelf as proper

you call that <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Subject</hi> as ſuch,
that is, as <hi>depending</hi> hereon by a more

(though it may withall include ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<hi>decretory</hi> in affairs of <hi>inferiour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment,</hi>
which though <hi>decretory</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of their Inferiours, is yet onely
<hi>executive</hi> in relation to the <hi>ſenſe and deſign</hi>
of their <hi>Supreme</hi> to which they are even
in ſuch caſes confined) for my part I do
not underſtand. If I knew what were
more, either <hi>indeed</hi> expreſſive of my
<hi>meaning,</hi> or likely to be underſtood ſo by
<hi>you,</hi> though indeed <hi>leſs proper,</hi> I would

diſpute the impropriety of my <hi>expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT you pretend your Arguments
to prove the <hi>Biſhop</hi> 
               <q>uncapable even of

                  <note place="margin">§ XVIII</note> (by which I ſuppoſe

               </q> This Argument alſo

every <hi>particular crime</hi> committed

be a <hi>Judge.</hi> Conſider, I pray, whether
what you would anſwer in defence of the
<hi>power of Princes,</hi> which may not be as
plauſibly urged in behalf of <hi>Biſhops?</hi>
Would you not ſay, that there is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
<hi>judicial power;</hi> ſuch as determines
<hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>general rules</hi> of proceeding, and
ſuch as does <hi>apply</hi> them to <hi>particular facts;</hi>
and that the <hi>former</hi> is that onely which
<hi>reſerved</hi> as the <hi>prerogative</hi> of the <hi>ſupreme
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:56909:89"/>
power,</hi> the <hi>later</hi> onely (which is that alone
which alone includes <hi>exploration</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and perſonal) is <hi>communicated</hi> to infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Officers? And you might have
deſcerned, that the <hi>former</hi> onely was that
which I called <hi>decretory,</hi> and which was
by me appropriated to our <hi>Supreme Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Monarch,</hi> which you ſee does not
neceſſarily include <hi>exploration.</hi> And even
concerning that <hi>exploration</hi> which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
for pronouncing Sentence in our
ordinary <hi>Secular Tribunals,</hi> you might have
anſwered in behalf of <hi>Princes,</hi> that it is
not neceſſary that it be ſo minute and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
as might be had from a <hi>perſonal</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with the <hi>perſon,</hi> and obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his <hi>humour and behaviour</hi> in the
courſe of his <hi>life;</hi> but for the <hi>Judges in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi>
that is thought ſufficient which
is <hi>publick and juridical,</hi> upon the <hi>teſtimonies</hi>
of honeſt perſons, who have known the
<hi>perſon</hi> and his <hi>fact:</hi> for upon theſe Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
our ordinary Judges do generally
proceed in ſentencing ſuch as they never
ſaw or knew before. Nor is it onely uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
in <hi>practice,</hi> but in <hi>reaſon</hi> it is thought
abundantly <hi>ſufficient.</hi> And, I pray, what
may be the diſparity that may make this
<hi>juſt</hi> in our <hi>Secular,</hi> and <hi>unjuſt</hi> in our <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
proceedings?</hi> Is it that the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:56909:90"/>
credit of the <hi>witneſſes</hi> may as well be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
as <hi>partial or miſtaken,</hi> (even where
no grounds do appear ſufficiently <hi>convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive</hi>
of ſuch a <hi>ſuſpicion</hi>) as the perſons
themſelves? Or is it that there have
been frequent Experiences of their decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſuch as have relied on their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony?
And are not theſe difficulties as
great in <hi>ſecular cauſes,</hi> where yet they are
not thought <hi>conſiderable?</hi> For <hi>humane</hi>
affairs are not capable of <hi>demonſtrations,</hi>
but proceed generally on onely <hi>moral cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,</hi>
oftentimes onely on <hi>probabilities,</hi>
which are therefore after the utmoſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<hi>diligence</hi> acknowledged <hi>fallible:</hi>
Yet it is thought <hi>prudent</hi> to rely even on
ſuch <hi>proofs,</hi> where the <hi>publick advantage</hi>
by the deciſion of ſuch cauſes is more
conſiderable, than the <hi>prejudice</hi> that may
redound to the <hi>perſon</hi> concerned by a
particular miſtake, when ſuch proof is
the beſt that the <hi>matter</hi> is capable of, or
that can be had, and that its <hi>failings</hi> are
more rare and unuſual. And the ſame
Reaſons are as cogent for the like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Courts.</hi> Or is it
that ſome <hi>crimes</hi> are ſo ſecret, as that
they cannot be <hi>juridically</hi> diſcovered with
ſuch Evidence as may <hi>ſatisfie</hi> a prudent
perſon without <hi>perſonal and particular</hi>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:56909:90"/>
information? But you may remember
that <hi>all crimes</hi> do not come under the <hi>cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance
of publick diſcipline,</hi> but onely ſuch
as are <hi>great and notorious,</hi> concerning
which this cannot be pretended. And
as <hi>Governours</hi> have thought it juſt and
prudent in ſome <hi>criminal cauſes,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
on <hi>conjectures and preſumptions,</hi> which
themſelves confeſs harſh in ſome <hi>inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
as judging it fitter that ſome few <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents</hi>
ſhould ſuffer ſome <hi>prejudice</hi> rather
than that <hi>many guilty</hi> ſhould eſcape; ſo in
others, where the <hi>probabilities</hi> are more
frequently fallible, they have rejected
them, as conceiving it more <hi>juſt</hi> that
ſome few <hi>Nocents</hi> ſhould eſcape, rather
that many <hi>Innocents</hi> ſhould ſuffer. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that, where this <hi>publick Evidence</hi>
does not appear, the <hi>crime</hi> cannot be ſo
<hi>ſcandalous,</hi> nor conſequently can the
<hi>Church</hi> in ſuch a caſe be ſo nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
for its <hi>puniſhment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>INDEED in ſome attempts it has
been found,<note place="margin">§ XIX.</note> that perſons have uſed much
more liberty <hi>in private</hi> for venting and
propagating ſcandalous Reports, than
when their <hi>oath</hi> has been required for
<hi>publick ſervice,</hi> by which means they
have at once made the <hi>crime very ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,</hi>
and yet reſcued the <hi>criminal</hi> from
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:56909:91"/>
               <hi>juſtice.</hi> But then the blame of ſuch <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity</hi>
is not to be imputed to the <hi>negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi>
of ſuch a <hi>Judge,</hi> but the <hi>prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of ſuch <hi>witneſſes,</hi> and therefore will
not be pertinent to our purpoſe. And
then for other <hi>leſs or leſs notorious</hi> Crimes
the private power of <hi>exhorting, repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
&amp;c.</hi> (which you call <hi>more than exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive,</hi>
and is no more denied a <hi>Miniſter</hi>
in his own <hi>Pariſh</hi> under a <hi>Dioceſan,</hi> than
any other Form of <hi>government) may and
muſt</hi> prove ſufficient, becauſe no other
is either <hi>convenient or poſſible.</hi> Or is it
that the <hi>penitence</hi> of the <hi>criminal,</hi> which
is requiſite to his <hi>abſolution,</hi> (which is
equally an act of <hi>power</hi> as that of <hi>cenſure</hi>)
cannot be ſo certainly known by this
publick <hi>Juridical Evidence?</hi> This (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that it may be as plauſibly objected
in Secular Cauſes, where <hi>perſonal peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,</hi>
at leaſt that which is <hi>judged</hi> ſo, is
as much required to <hi>abſolution from ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
penalties,</hi> and where theſe <hi>Juridical
Evidences</hi> are perfectly as fallible) will
not appear ſo difficult as it may ſeem, if
it be conſidered what <hi>kind of penitence</hi> is
requiſite for this <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Abſolution?</hi>
1. Not a <hi>univerſal penitence for all ſins,</hi> but
onely thoſe which he had been before
<hi>cenſured</hi> for. 2. Theſe not <hi>ſecret,</hi> but
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:56909:91"/>
               <hi>publick and notorious.</hi> For none but theſe
can be <hi>ſcandalous,</hi> and none but <hi>ſcandalous
ſins</hi> do fall under publick <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction.</hi>
And, 3. Not <hi>real penitence,</hi>
even for <hi>theſe</hi> themſelves, but onely ſo
far as it may be ſignified to the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a <hi>prudent perſon</hi> by <hi>exteriour indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
And, 4. Theſe <hi>exteriour indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
not <hi>private</hi> but <hi>publick,</hi> ſuch as <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
confeſſion</hi> of the ſin, and <hi>asking for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs</hi>
for it, and giving <hi>publick ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
to the <hi>injured party</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi>
and her <hi>ſcandalized enemies,</hi> and all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantiated
with ſuch pregnant <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of ſincerity,</hi> as may be thought
ſufficient <hi>probabilities</hi> of it in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>equal prudent perſons.</hi> And,
5. Theſe <hi>publick indications,</hi> ſuch as may
ſatisfie even <hi>ſtrangers,</hi> who have been
<hi>ſcandalized</hi> with his <hi>crimes,</hi> though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted
with his <hi>perſon.</hi> Now why
a <hi>Biſhop</hi> may not in this <hi>publick juridical</hi>
way of proceeding <hi>explore the penitence,</hi>
even of <hi>particular criminals,</hi> without <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal</hi>
acquaintance, as well as the <hi>ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized
multitude,</hi> and as well as <hi>ſecular
Judges,</hi> as you have produced none, ſo
for my part I ſee no cogent Argument.
And yet further, 6. Conſidering that it
is not the <hi>perſonal ſin,</hi> but the <hi>publick ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:56909:92"/>
of it, which brings it to a <hi>publick cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance,</hi>
though theſe ſigns ſhould <hi>fail</hi>
of ſignifying his <hi>real perſonal</hi> penitence;
yet if they ſatisfie the <hi>multitude,</hi> though
<hi>erroneouſly</hi> they take off the <hi>ſcandal,</hi> and
therefore give a juſt reaſon of revoking
ſuch publick <hi>cenſares?</hi> For every <hi>cauſe</hi>
that may be <hi>ſufficient to diſſuade a perſon,</hi>
upon an account of his own <hi>intereſts,</hi> to
abſtain from <hi>communion,</hi> will not be ſo
for <hi>depriving</hi> him of it <hi>authoritatively.</hi>
For they are not all ſorts of <hi>crimes</hi> that
put us out of the <hi>ſtate of grace,</hi> as they
ought to be that deprive us of our <hi>right
to communion;</hi> not all that can deprive us
of that right, that have not Evidence
enough to warrant a <hi>coercive involuntary</hi>
puniſhment; nor all that have that Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that are fit to be puniſhed <hi>publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
and I believe you will not queſtion
but that <hi>Excommunication</hi> is a <hi>publick</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.
And thus, I believe, by this
time you may underſtand, how that
though the <hi>Biſhop</hi> ſentence upon <hi>other
mens words,</hi> (which your ſelf confeſs may
<hi>perhaps ſometimes</hi> be done) yet there are
as good <hi>prudential preſervatives</hi> againſt
that inconvenience which you thence
infer, <hi>That he muſt excommunicate all that
ſome body elſe ſays he muſt excommunicate,</hi>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:56909:92"/>
as there are againſt the like in <hi>Secular
Tribunals,</hi> which do confeſſedly ſentence
on <hi>other mens words,</hi> and yet do not
therefore condemn all that <hi>ſome body ſaith
they muſt condemn.</hi>

            <p>YOUR ſeventh Diſparity is,<note place="margin">§ XX.</note> 
               <q>That
in the Kingdom there is not one <hi>Subject</hi>
of an hundred, or many hundred, who
hath <hi>Law-ſuits</hi> with others once in a
year, or ſeven years, or his life; not
one of ſome hundreds where you have
lived, that findeth the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> work
as a <hi>criminal, &amp;c.</hi> But we are all of a
<hi>ſinning corrupt diſpoſition,</hi> and that the
<hi>Paſtor</hi> hath few of his flock that need
not ſome perſonal Applications in one
degree or other. And even as to <hi>groſs
ſins</hi> lived in, and <hi>ignorance,</hi> or <hi>hereſie</hi>
againſt the very <hi>eſſence of Chriſtianity,</hi> it
is a good <hi>Pariſh,</hi> where a conſiderable
part of it are not guilty.</q> To this it is
eaſie to reply, That though the caſe
were as you have repreſented it, that
men were, not onely where <hi>you have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi>
but <hi>generally</hi> more guilty of <hi>crimes</hi>
obnoxious to <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> than <hi>Secular</hi>
cognizance; yet it would not follow,
that more were governable by a <hi>Secular</hi>
than by an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Magiſtrate;</hi>
1. Becauſe I have already ſhewn, That
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:56909:93"/>
there are even in the <hi>ſame precincts</hi> very
many more <hi>perſons,</hi> if not <hi>crimes,</hi> ſubject
to the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> than the <hi>Church,</hi> as <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,
Excommunicated perſons,</hi> and ſuch
as are <hi>incorrigible by Eccleſiaſtical cenſures,
&amp;c.</hi> Beſides thoſe who are <hi>religious,</hi>
who are not the leſs <hi>ſubject</hi> to the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate</hi>
for their being Members of the
<hi>Church.</hi> And, 2. There are many other
<hi>ends of government</hi> beſides the <hi>puniſhment
of criminals,</hi> ſuch as are the <hi>prevention</hi> of
the <hi>crimes,</hi> the promotion of <hi>unanimity</hi>
and <hi>induſtry,</hi> and publick generous <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,</hi>
and the <hi>determination of diſputable
controverſies,</hi> wherein <hi>good and well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
men may <hi>bonâfide</hi> differ from each
other, and the like. They muſt as well
<hi>build</hi> as take away the <hi>rubbiſh.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is a <hi>government</hi> where there
are no <hi>crimes,</hi> over the <hi>Angels and beatifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Spirits.</hi> But eſpecially among men,
where <hi>crimes</hi> are at leaſt acknowledged
<hi>poſſible,</hi> the <hi>prevention of crimes</hi> may be a
work of no leſs diligence than their <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</hi>
And, 3. The freedom of good
men from theſe more ordinary <hi>ſcandalous
crimes,</hi> (which I perceive you to inſtance
in) though it may leſs frequently exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
the <hi>ſecular power;</hi> yet where it does,
it will moſt <hi>dangerouſly.</hi> For, 1. <hi>Virtue</hi>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:56909:93"/>
raiſes the <hi>ſpirits</hi> of men, and makes
them <hi>active and induſtrious,</hi> that they
may <hi>ſatisfie</hi> themſelves of their <hi>uſefulneſs</hi>
in their <hi>generations.</hi> Whereas, on the
contrary, <hi>Vice</hi> does <hi>emaſculate</hi> mens <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi>
and make them <hi>ſlothful and ſluggiſh,</hi>
and lovers of their own <hi>eaſe,</hi> and more
unfit for <hi>commotions.</hi> And, 2. <hi>Virtue</hi>
makes men publick ſpirited, whereas
<hi>Vice</hi> does debaſe them to <hi>private and little
Intereſts.</hi> So that the Adverſaries of theſe
are onely ſuch <hi>ordinarily</hi> as may oppoſe
them in their <hi>limited and particular</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
and therefore onely <hi>private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;</hi>
but theſe having the ſame object
with the <hi>publick Magiſtrate,</hi> that is, the
<hi>publick concernment,</hi> muſt more directly
claſh with him in caſe of <hi>different perſuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
And, 3. The very <hi>authority of Virtue</hi>
with the <hi>multitude,</hi> (who cannot but <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence</hi>
it in <hi>others,</hi> how little ſoever they
<hi>practiſe it themſelves</hi>) cannot chuſe but
very much advantage <hi>virtuous perſons</hi> for
the forming of a <hi>party</hi> more than ſuch as
are <hi>vicious,</hi> who, though they may be
flattered and loved by ſuch as are <hi>gainers</hi>
by their <hi>vices,</hi> yet cannot in prudence be
thought ſo <hi>fit</hi> for management of their
<hi>publick concernments,</hi> even by <hi>vicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi>
themſelves, who act upon princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:56909:94"/>
of worldly <hi>prudence,</hi> as they who are
more <hi>honoured,</hi> and <hi>publick-ſpirited,</hi> and
<hi>honeſt and ſincere,</hi> and ſo every way as
well more <hi>fit,</hi> as more <hi>able</hi> for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of a <hi>publick truſt.</hi> And, 4. The
onely <hi>curbs</hi> of the Supreme Powers, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>rewards or puniſhments,</hi> are leſs
regarded by <hi>virtuous</hi> than <hi>vicious</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and therefore muſt needs be leſs
able to <hi>reſtrain</hi> them. For how can he
who undervalues Death and Fear, and all
deprivation of <hi>exteriors,</hi> be governed by
any <hi>humane power?</hi> Beſides, 5. The great
courage, and that not <hi>precipitant</hi> but <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,</hi>
which animates <hi>good men</hi> to the
ſuſception of great Attempts, from the
ſatisfaction of their own <hi>conſciences,</hi> and
their ſtrong confidence of the <hi>preſent
aſſiſtance</hi> or <hi>future rewards of God,</hi> of which
<hi>wicked men</hi> are wholly deſtitute. Theſe
conſiderations, I ſay, and many others,
may ſuffice to ſhew, that the miſtakes of
<hi>good men</hi> are of more <hi>miſchievous</hi> influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
on the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> than the
crimes of <hi>debauched perſons,</hi> and therefore
far from <hi>diminiſhing</hi> the care of the <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Magiſtrate.</hi> And accordingly you
may find the moſt <hi>virtuous ages</hi> of the
<hi>Romans</hi> more troubleſom for popular
Broils and Seditions, than thoſe later
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:56909:94"/>
ones of <hi>wickedneſs.</hi> Witneſs the almoſt
perpetual claſhings betwixt the <hi>Senate</hi>
and the <hi>People,</hi> the popular envies againſt
their <hi>Hero's, Coriolanus, Camillus, Scipio
Africanus, &amp;c.</hi> But, 4. Though the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality</hi>
of people were <hi>actually</hi> every
where as little troubleſom to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
as where you have known them
(which I doubt you can hardly undertake
for;) yet you muſt not thence eſtimate
the <hi>qualifications and duty</hi> of a <hi>Magiſtrate.</hi>
For as none would think it <hi>prudent</hi> for a
perſon putting to Sea in a calm, to chooſe
a Pilot <hi>ſufficient</hi> onely for that ſeaſon, but
<hi>unprovided</hi> for a Storm; ſo certainly a
<hi>Magiſtrate</hi> ought to be <hi>prepar'd and qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
with abilities for governing a <hi>crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and unquiet</hi> people, even then when
he lies under the <hi>actual</hi> obligation for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing
them, eſpecially conſidering it
as a caſe ſo very <hi>ordinary,</hi> and ſo <hi>probably</hi>
to be expected. If therefore a <hi>Biſhop</hi>
may not undertake the charge of a <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſe,</hi>
becauſe impoſſible to be performed
by him; I may as well by the ſame <hi>points
of reaſon</hi> conclude, that a <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> may
not take that of a <hi>Province or Kingdom,</hi>
even when in the good humour you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
them, becauſe he muſt not <hi>in pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
venture on that, unleſs he be <hi>prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:56909:95"/>
for them when <hi>vicious,</hi> which you
ſuppoſe impoſſible, and therefore unfit
to be engaged on. And, 5. You do not
propoſe the caſe with any <hi>equality;</hi> for if
you would do ſo, you ſhould not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
a <hi>Prince</hi> governing a <hi>regular people</hi>
and a <hi>Biſhop</hi> with an irregular ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<hi>Dioceſe,</hi> but have ſupposed the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
in both caſes <hi>regular,</hi> or in both <hi>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular.</hi>
And if you will needs ſuppoſe
in favour of the <hi>Prince,</hi> that his <hi>Subjects</hi>
are as little <hi>criminal</hi> in his Courts, as you
have found them where you have been
acquainted, to ſhew the <hi>poſſibility</hi> of his
<hi>governing</hi> ſuch a people, though in a large
<hi>precinct;</hi> why can you not ſuppoſe in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> that the <hi>Subjects</hi> of his
<hi>Dioceſe</hi> behave themſelves as innocently
in reference to <hi>crimes</hi> obnoxious to the
<hi>publick cognizance</hi> of his <hi>Courts?</hi> Is it
either becauſe that even perſons ſo ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
equally innocent in relation to the
charges of <hi>both Courts,</hi> are yet more <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultly</hi>
governable by an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> than
a <hi>Secular Magiſtrate?</hi> This is not as
much as pretended, I am confident, not
as much as plauſibly proved, in your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Diſcourſe. Or is it that the Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
it ſelf in relation to <hi>Eccleſiaſtical
crimes</hi> is more difficult, it being more
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:56909:95"/>
               <hi>rare and improbable</hi> to find a people inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
in <hi>crimes</hi> of publick <hi>Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> than
<hi>Secular</hi> cognizance? If this later be your
meaning, I doubt neither of the <hi>reaſons</hi>
intimated by you will maintain you in
it. Not that of your own <hi>experience;</hi>
for I believe you would have found thoſe
<hi>good perſons</hi> of your acquaintance as little
troubleſom to the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> as the <hi>King's
Courts,</hi> as little guilty of inceſtuous <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,</hi>
forging <hi>Wills and Teſtaments, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
&amp;c.</hi> as of any acts of <hi>ſecular inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</hi>
And as for the other concerning
our <hi>propenſity</hi> to <hi>actual,</hi> deduced from the
<hi>original,</hi> ſin; you have not as yet proved
this propenſity greater to <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi>
than <hi>Secular</hi> crimes. But it is rather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that as the <hi>crimes</hi> cognoſcible in
the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Courts</hi> are generally
more heinous, ſo they are more eaſily
avoidable. If you have any inclination
to think ſo, for preventing it I pray re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
what I have already intimated,
that they are not all ſorts of <hi>ſins againſt
God</hi> that are cognoſcible in the <hi>Biſhops
Courts,</hi> but onely ſuch as are <hi>great,</hi> and
<hi>ſcandalous,</hi> and <hi>notorious.</hi> And then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
whether it be not as eaſie to ſuppoſe
a people innocent of <hi>great,</hi> and <hi>ſcandalous,</hi>
and <hi>notorious ſins</hi> againſt <hi>God and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:56909:96"/>
as of <hi>injuſtice</hi> towards <hi>Men.</hi> For
this indeed will be the true ſtate of the
queſtion. 2. Therefore it will not be ſo
eaſily proved, that the <hi>crimes</hi> cognoſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the <hi>Secular Courts</hi> are ſo <hi>few,</hi> in
compariſon of thoſe that are <hi>Eccleſiaſtical.</hi>
This I have already proved before, and
am not willing to repeat what I have
there ſaid. At preſent methinks your
own Conceſſions, if cloſely reflected on,
would have prevented your pretending
otherwiſe. For, beſides that thoſe mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of perſons guilty of <hi>crimes</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to the <hi>Biſhops Courts,</hi> (which I
have ſaid every <hi>impenitent ſinner</hi> is not,
and have given my reaſon why I ſaid ſo)
are I doubt guilty of many more <hi>civil
crimes,</hi> for which I ſhall onely appeal to
your own experience; I pray conſider
how many of the crimes cognoſcible in
the <hi>Biſhops Courts</hi> are originally <hi>civil,</hi> as
thoſe concerning <hi>Marriages, Wills and
Teſtaments, Tithes. &amp;c.</hi> which are mere
arbitrary conceſſions of <hi>Princes</hi> in favour
of the <hi>Church,</hi> as protected by them.
And the reſt that are not, yet come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Princes cognizance,</hi> as the <hi>Churches
Canons</hi> are made <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,</hi>
and her Cenſures are ſeconded
by <hi>coercive ſecular penalties</hi> impoſed by
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:56909:96"/>
the <hi>Prince</hi> on ſuch as have proved refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
againſt her <hi>Spiritual Authority.</hi>
Upon which account it is impoſſible but
that the <hi>Secular cauſes</hi> muſt needs prove
more <hi>numerous,</hi> as including all <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticals,</hi>
and many <hi>proper</hi> to themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.
So that this Diſparity is every
way unconvictive of your purpoſe. For
if you mean thoſe perſons who are ſo
<hi>innocent of ſecular crimes,</hi> to be different
from thoſe who are ſuppoſed ſo very
<hi>guilty of Eccleſiaſticals,</hi> then there can be
no juſt <hi>diſparity</hi> pretended, becauſe there
is indeed no equal <hi>compariſon.</hi> But if you
mean the <hi>ſame perſons</hi> in both caſes, then
the Diſparity cannot be pretended true,
becauſe the Suppoſition is falſe.</p>
            <p>BUT you object in favour of me,<note place="margin">§ XXI.</note>
               <q>That the <hi>Pariſh-prieſt</hi> is to <hi>reprove, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort,</hi>
and <hi>convince</hi> [ſinners] firſt, till
he prove them <hi>impenitent;</hi> and that he
is to <hi>inſtruct the Ignorant, Infidels,</hi> and
<hi>Hereticks;</hi>
               </q> (which muſt needs conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably

who onely in caſe of their convicted <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency</hi>
in the uſe of theſe <hi>means,</hi> ſhould
be further impleaded in that ſeverer way
of proceeding in the <hi>Biſhops Courts.</hi>) To
this you anſwer. 1. <hi>That this is more than
an executive power.</hi> If it be ſo, I do not know
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:56909:97"/>
any that denies it you, ſo that you have
no reaſon that I know of to complain on
that account. None hinders you from
<hi>reproving, exhorting, convincing,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing</hi>
whom you pleaſe, eſpecially
ſuch as are <hi>intruſted</hi> to you as Members
of your <hi>cure.</hi> But I am ſure this is not
more than that <hi>executive power,</hi> which
I ſaid was <hi>communicated</hi> to the <hi>inferiour
Clergie,</hi> in oppoſition to that which I cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>decretory,</hi> reſerved to our <hi>Eccleſiaſtical

this power of <hi>reproving, exhorting, &amp;c. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretory.</hi>
I believe you meant a power
<hi>merely executive.</hi> But you may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that that was neither my <hi>word nor
meaning;</hi> nor do I for my part think this
power mentioned by you to be more
than that which were <hi>merely executive.</hi>
My reaſon you will ſuddenly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY,<note place="margin">§ XXII.</note> therefore you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
<q>
                  <hi>That you deſire no more at all from
Biſhops or any.</hi>
               </q> If ſo, you need not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
it, for none denies it you. But you
ſay, <q>You know no other <hi>Epiſcopal power</hi>
over the <hi>people,</hi> but thus <hi>perſonally to
convince</hi> men, and to <hi>declare</hi> to the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation</hi>
upon proof, the <hi>fitneſs or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitneſs</hi>
of men for their <hi>communion by
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:56909:97"/>
penitence or impenitence.</hi>
               </q> If you know
no other power than this, you know
none at all. For this power of <hi>convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing</hi>
men will as well agree to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<hi>Laick</hi> who has reaſon on his ſide, as
the greateſt <hi>Biſhop;</hi> ſeeing either of them
may <hi>convince</hi> if furniſhed with ſuch <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
but neither can without it. And
yet ſure you will not ſay, that the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<hi>Laick</hi> has any <hi>power</hi> over him whom
he may thus <hi>convince,</hi> at leaſt not cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
to your own principles, who in
oppoſition to our <hi>Lay-chancellours</hi> make
<hi>Juriſdiction</hi> inſeparable from <hi>Orders.</hi> So
alſo if the <hi>power of Excommunication</hi> be
no more than declaring a perſon <hi>unfit</hi> for

would have them, either <hi>communicate</hi>
with, or <hi>ſeparate</hi> from ſuch a perſon. For
indeed no <hi>declaration</hi> of it ſelf <hi>formally and

it is a <hi>promulgation</hi> of that which <hi>antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently</hi>
has a juſt <hi>obligative power, In actu
primo,</hi> yet is not <hi>in actu ſecundo</hi> obligato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>quoad nos</hi> till we know it. As though
the King and Parliament have a power of
making <hi>Laws,</hi> and therefore what has
paſſed all their Votes, in the firſt moment
when it has done ſo, is immediately a
<hi>Law;</hi> yet it is not <hi>in actu ſecundo</hi> obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
on the <hi>Subject,</hi> ſo as that its <hi>violation</hi>
by him does incur the annexed <hi>penalty</hi> till
it be legally <hi>promulged.</hi> Yet ſo it is, on
the contray, that this legal <hi>promulgation</hi>
it ſelf, that is, ſuch a <hi>promulgation</hi> as is
performed by the perſon <hi>authorized</hi> by
Law, with all the requiſite <hi>circumſtances,</hi>
cannot make any thing really <hi>obligatory,</hi>
that has not formerly been decreed by
the <hi>Legiſlative Power.</hi> Unleſs therefore
there be in the Church a <hi>power</hi> antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to ſuch <hi>declaration,</hi> the <hi>declaration</hi> can
make none, ſeeing every one may <hi>declare</hi>
his own ſenſe as well as the <hi>Governour;</hi>
and <hi>declaration</hi> does onely make that <hi>obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
quoad nos,</hi> which was ſo <hi>in ſe</hi> ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently.

I did not before charge you

but on account of the particular <hi>reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs</hi>
of the thing, to withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from his <hi>communion.</hi> And even
<hi>then</hi> it ſelf, if he can perſuade a few to
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:56909:99"/>
his Party he may upon theſe principles,
without any <hi>ſcruple of conſcience</hi> erect a

what can hinder him when <hi>government,</hi>
which is the principle of <hi>unity</hi> in all <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties,</hi>
is thus deprived of all other awe
of <hi>conſcience</hi> to oblige him to <hi>obedience,
diſtinct</hi> from his particular ſatisfaction of

never ſo onely <hi>pretended?</hi> And
when the <hi>unity</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> is
thus made to depend on ſo <hi>hazardous and

of every particular <hi>indifferent

ſecure it for ſo long a time, as the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of the <hi>Church</hi> was deſigned for by
him, who firſt did <hi>conſtitute</hi> it? I know for
prevention of theſe inconveniences you
would have <hi>Governours</hi> cautious in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
any thing but what is <hi>clear and
neceſſary.</hi> And for my part I wiſh it ſo
too, that for matters of <hi>belief</hi> (it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Subjects minds to <hi>believe</hi> what
they pleaſe) they would determine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what were very <hi>evident,</hi> and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:56909:99"/>
even for matters <hi>indifferent,</hi> that they
would neither determine more of them
than were <hi>needful,</hi> nor ſuch of them as
were not <hi>convenient</hi> in the circumſtances,
and <hi>ſuitable</hi> to the diſpoſitions of the <hi>age</hi>
of their determination, nor be too <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious</hi>
in maintaining them when their
inconveniences ſhould be found greater
than their advantage. Though I confeſs
withall, that it were in prudence much
<hi>ſafer,</hi> to make any ſuch change by their
own <hi>free</hi> Election, than to ſeem <hi>neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
to it by mutinous and ſeditious <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances</hi>
of their Subjects, ſuch a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance</hi>
being of greater conſequential
prejudice to <hi>government,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Unity,</hi> than a maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of a thing <hi>indifferent,</hi> though <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient.</hi>
But withall you know, that
<hi>Unanimity</hi> even in things indifferent
(much more in matters of Faith) is in
general and indefinitely <hi>neceſſary,</hi> though
not <hi>particularly</hi> determined in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
that this unanimous obſervance of
things of ſuch a nature is not morally
poſſible by the particular <hi>conviction</hi> of
every Subject of their <hi>fitneſs;</hi> that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is no ſecurity for their <hi>unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous</hi>
obſervance but that of <hi>authority,</hi>
and no <hi>authority</hi> ſo proper as that which
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:56909:100"/>
is <hi>Eccleſiaſtical;</hi> that when it is ſo impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
it is an inſtance of <hi>obedience</hi> to the
<hi>authority</hi> impoſing; that being ſo, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it may be in its own <hi>nature,</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſtill remain <hi>indifferent</hi> as to its uſe,
ſeeing it is not indifferent whether Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
ought to be obedient to their lawful
Sovereigns. And therefore methinks it
would become you in healing <hi>Church-diviſions,</hi>
to take a care of <hi>preſerving</hi> as
well the <hi>Prerogatives of Governours,</hi> as
the <hi>Chriſtian Liberty of Subjects,</hi> ſeeing
<hi>extremes</hi> on both ſides are alike prejudicial
to <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Unity.</hi> Indeed I confeſs
many of our <hi>firſt Reformers</hi> not to have
been ſo <hi>cautions</hi> herein as the <hi>Intereſt of the
Church</hi> would have required, who feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves oppreſſed by a <hi>Tyrannical
Eccleſiaſtical Power,</hi> and being extremely
exaſperated by their violent and rigorous
proceedings, were almoſt onely ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
about <hi>Negatives,</hi> never ſatisfying
themſelves with any reaſonable retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of ſuch exorbitancies; onely ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how far <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Power</hi> might
<hi>not preſume,</hi> but not how far it might <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</hi>
And they were then the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable
for not proceeding to ſuch <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi>
becauſe the <hi>ends</hi> of ſuch <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical

               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:56909:100"/>
both in <hi>faith and practice</hi> were then more
eaſily attainable without the Interpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of ſuch a <hi>power.</hi> For
their firſt zeal againſt the common Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
will oblige them in prudence to
conceal their leſſer Animoſities, and the
danger of weakening themſelves, whoſe
united ſtrengths were no more than ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for their common <hi>preſervation,</hi>
which was a <hi>miſchief ſo great and immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,</hi>
as might make many <hi>leſs,</hi> at leaſt
comparatively, tolerable, and might keep
them from being ſo dogmatical in impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

zele of their firſt beginnings, and the
watchful eyes of their Adverſaries for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
their <hi>lapſes,</hi> and the great uſe of

am neceſſitated to interpoſe this Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>compulſion of Eccleſiaſtical Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,</hi>
becauſe I ſee you otherwiſe apt
enough to miſunderſtand me. And even
for the obſervation of things <hi>indifferent,</hi>
the very great <hi>opinion</hi> they had entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for ſome of the firſt <hi>Reformers,</hi> and
the little leiſure for reflection on their

by their heats againſt the <hi>common

had to <hi>diſſent,</hi> at leaſt to make a <hi>breach,</hi>
for little things, from them whom they

            </p>
            <p>YET we find thoſe <hi>Hero's</hi> themſelves
complain of this defect.<note place="margin">§ XXIV</note> Our <hi>Church of

and wiſhes alſo that it were <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored</hi>

to alienate him from the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi>

is more than <hi>perſuaſive and declaratory,</hi>

I ſhall not mention thoſe exceſſes

to <hi>Pariſh Miniſters;</hi> and the reaſon
you give for it ſeems to me more <hi>parado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xical:</hi>
               <q>That the <hi>Miniſter</hi> can have no

and that there is no <hi>law nor penalty</hi> that

               <q>which you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:56909:103"/>
to be Chriſtians and communicate,

that you were deſirous to find Objections
againſt us, when thus almoſt at the ſame

immediately before you blamed us for
<hi>wanting.</hi> For the difference is not (as
one would think) from the moſt candid
interpretation of your words, <hi>That you
would have ſuch guilty perſons forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

Chriſtians, and communicate without your

what <hi>force</hi> is it that you mean? is
it that <hi>exteriour</hi> one of <hi>laws and corporal

to the <hi>Church,</hi> but the <hi>civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates</hi>
power <hi>circa ſacra,</hi> who is therefore
to be blamed for it, and not the <hi>Church,</hi>
if it be a <hi>crime,</hi> and ſome body muſt needs
bear the <hi>blame.</hi> Or are they the <hi>ſpiritual
coercions</hi> of the <hi>Church?</hi> I know none
of that kind but <hi>Excommunication,</hi> which
is of no force with thoſe who do not <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue</hi>
the advantage of <hi>communion;</hi> and
they who <hi>do,</hi> need not to be <hi>forced</hi> to
confer with their <hi>Miniſter.</hi> Beſides that,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:56909:104"/>
your ſelf know and have confeſſed, that
the power of <hi>Suſpenſion</hi> of unworthy
perſons from the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is allowed to
the <hi>Pariſh Miniſter</hi> even in our <hi>Church,</hi>
ſo that even in that caſe he has his reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

which you are juſtly ſo much concerned.
And beſides your own acknowledgment
of many <hi>good Prelatick Chriſtians</hi> on other

<hi>communion</hi> with the <hi>Church,</hi> though
they have gone to <hi>priſon and death</hi> for
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:56909:104"/>
it]</q> not onely in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days, but
even in your own memory in <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Ireland,</hi> when their being ſo has
brought ſufferings on them, not reſcued
them from them. So that I do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
why you ſhould ſtigmatize
them with the name of <hi>Prelatical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>INDEED if you could ſhew,<note place="margin">§ XXVI</note> that
it was rather the extraordinary good
<hi>influences of God,</hi> and their own <hi>good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,</hi>
that made them <hi>voluntarily</hi>
good, againſt their <hi>worldly intereſts,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
their <hi>malignant principles,</hi>
which of themſelves would have made
them otherwiſe; I confeſs your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
<hi>inclination to ſpeak of things as
they are</hi> might have excuſed the rigour
of ſuch expreſſions. But, 1. You cannot
but know that theſe <hi>exterior compulſions</hi>
have not been proper to <hi>Prelatiſts,</hi> but
common to all thoſe that have owned
ſuch a thing as <hi>diſcipline, Presbyterians</hi>
as well as <hi>Papiſts;</hi> ſo that there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to <hi>appropriate</hi> to ſuch <hi>Chriſtians</hi> as are
made ſo by <hi>coercive diſcipline</hi> the invidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
name of <hi>Prelatical.</hi> And, 2. You
have not, and I believe you cannot, prove
that ſuch <hi>external force</hi> muſt needs of it
ſelf make <hi>Prelatiſts diſſemblers:</hi> 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
all that are of <hi>themſelves</hi> good, will
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:56909:105"/>
not <hi>need ſuch force,</hi> this being onely a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary
reſerve for reducing ſuch as are
deſperate, as to that <hi>power</hi> which <hi>alone</hi>
you allow the <hi>Church,</hi> that is, of <hi>perſuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
none being this way <hi>compelled,</hi> but
they who cannot be <hi>perſuaded.</hi> And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
for ſuch perſons it is at leaſt <hi>a leſs
evil</hi> to <hi>profeſs</hi> themſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi>
though <hi>diſſemblingly,</hi> than not ſo much
as to <hi>profeſs</hi> themſelves ſo, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the <hi>honour</hi> which is done <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
even in profeſſing it, and the <hi>edification
of others,</hi> who may be moved by their
<hi>example,</hi> and that they are by this means
taken from the ſins of <hi>open hoſtilities</hi>
againſt the <hi>truth.</hi> And, 2. You muſt not
preſently condemn all of <hi>diſſimulation,</hi>
who are brought to a ſenſe of their duty
by <hi>fear.</hi> Otherwiſe you will condemn
all the <hi>penal laws</hi> of the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi>
as tending to make their Subjects <hi>diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blingly</hi>
loyal, and all Gods <hi>providential
croſſes and menaces of hell,</hi> as tending ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to make men <hi>profeſs</hi> themſelves
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> rather than be damned, &amp;c.
For frequent experience cannot but have
informed you, who are ſo very <hi>experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,</hi>
that the <hi>fear of Man,</hi> as well as of
<hi>God,</hi> has to many proved <hi>the beginning of
true wiſdom;</hi> that <hi>good Chriſtians</hi> have
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:56909:105"/>
found more occaſion to bleſs <hi>God</hi> for their
<hi>croſſes</hi> than their <hi>conſolations;</hi> that the
terrible <hi>vengeance</hi> of God againſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
even in this life, under the <hi>Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,</hi>
was a great reſtraint to that
hard-hearted people, to <hi>deterr</hi> them from
their ſins, and to reduce them to <hi>ſolid real</hi>
piety, whom we find leſs efficaciouſly
moved to their duty by any <hi>other means.</hi>
For I pray conſider, 3. That this <hi>diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
which you ſeem to ſuppoſe to be
the ordinary <hi>conſequent of exterior compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi>
cannot indeed have any place but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
theſe conditions; that, 1. The <hi>ſufferer</hi>
do believe his cauſe to be <hi>good;</hi> and, 2. That
ſuch belief be grounded on <hi>conſcientious</hi>
motives, (whether <hi>really or apparently</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious
I now diſpute not, ſeeing the
perſon muſt act according to the <hi>evidence
of his own conſcience,</hi> however <hi>really</hi> errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
after he has uſed his beſt endeavours
for its information;) and, 3. That this
<hi>perſuaſion</hi> of his <hi>conſcience</hi> be unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
or at leaſt, 4. That ſuch <hi>exteriour
compulſion</hi> be neither a <hi>means</hi> nor a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
occaſion</hi> to make men <hi>alter</hi> their <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,</hi>
atleaſt not to make <hi>good and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious</hi>
perſons to <hi>alter,</hi> at leaſt not <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily;</hi>
ſo that it be preſumed, that the
<hi>multitude of goodmen</hi> cannot be <hi>altered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:56909:106"/>
ſuch terms,</hi> and therefore that if the
<hi>multitude</hi> do, they cannot be generally
preſumed to do it on <hi>juſt and conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi>
motives; and yet, 5. That, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
his being <hi>perſuaded as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,</hi>
he be by his <hi>exterior compulſion</hi>
wrought on to make an unveracious <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour
profeſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW to ſhew briefly that none of
theſe hold,<note place="margin">§ XXVII.</note> at leaſt not all of them, which
is requiſite for your purpoſe; I muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
1. That the deſign of this kind of
diſcourſe againſt theſe <hi>coercive</hi> means, if
it be to <hi>hinder</hi> them, muſt be to perſuade
<hi>them</hi> in whoſe power they are, that is,
the <hi>Church</hi> or the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> that their
practice were <hi>ſinful to them.</hi> That,
2. Nothing can be <hi>imputably ſinful to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,</hi>
but what either does or may,
in the uſe of their utmoſt <hi>moral diligence,
appear</hi> to them to be ſo. So that it is not
<hi>your opinion</hi> of the <hi>ſinfulneſs</hi> of ſuch <hi>coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,</hi>
that can prove it <hi>ſinful to them,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
they be of the ſame <hi>mind,</hi> or neglect
the moral means of <hi>information,</hi> which
if you ſuppoſe the caſe <hi>evident,</hi> you muſt
preſume ſuch as would infallibly bring
<hi>them</hi> to be ſo. 3. Therefore what are
the real <hi>thoughts of Governours,</hi> and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they have made uſe of the <hi>means of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:56909:106"/>
information with integrity and diligence,</hi>
none can for their <hi>own ſatisfaction</hi> (which
is principally to be taken notice of in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the <hi>imputableneſs of ſin</hi>) judge of
ſo well as <hi>themſelves.</hi> Nor, 4. Can we
better be aſſured of their <hi>ſenſe</hi> herein
than by their <hi>word,</hi> unleſs it be by the
<hi>evidence</hi> of the thing. It is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>every proof</hi> that may ſeem ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to <hi>our ſelves,</hi> that may warrant our
<hi>preſumption of their ſenſe,</hi> unleſs it be ſuch
as is thought cognoſcible by <hi>them,</hi> and
whoſe <hi>evidence</hi> is preſumed <hi>inevitable</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a <hi>ſincere examination.</hi> And, 5. It is
not ſufficient as to the matter in hand,
that it appear that <hi>ſome perſons</hi> have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
been made <hi>hypocrites</hi> for fear of this
<hi>exterior coercion,</hi> but it muſt further be
ſhewn that its <hi>natural tendency</hi> is to do
ſo, or at leaſt that it is its moſt <hi>uſual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent.</hi>
And, 6. That it is an <hi>occaſion</hi> of
their <hi>hypocriſie</hi> by virtue of <hi>it ſelf,</hi> not of
the <hi>diſpoſition</hi> of the <hi>Subject.</hi> For the ſins
that are derived from the <hi>diſpoſition</hi> of the
<hi>Subject,</hi> they that give the immediate
occaſions are not reſponſible for. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
when the <hi>wicked turn Gods grace into
wantonneſs,</hi> and thoſe things which ſhould
have been for their <hi>good</hi> into the <hi>occaſions
of falling,</hi> and the <hi>word preached</hi> turns to
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:56909:107"/>
be the <hi>ſavour of death unto death</hi> to its
<hi>unworthy hearers,</hi> and the bleſſed <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lords Supper</hi> to its <hi>unworthy
receivers;</hi> you might conclude <hi>God,</hi> who
gives thoſe abuſed favours, to be the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>
occaſion of the <hi>abuſers</hi> ſin. And (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there are ſome who will with leſs
ſcruple grant of <hi>God,</hi> that he is, the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigner</hi>
of his <hi>creatures</hi> ſins, than they
would grant it concerning any <hi>good men</hi>)
S. <hi>Paul</hi> had been the <hi>culpable</hi> occaſion of
the <hi>perjury</hi> of thoſe <hi>conſpirators,</hi> who had
<hi>ſworn not to eat</hi> untill they had killed him,
onely by making uſe of <hi>juſt means for his
own preſervation.</hi> And theſe you may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
believe to be the <hi>thoughts of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,</hi>
concerning thoſe whom they are
pleaſed to <hi>proſecute</hi> for their <hi>opinions.</hi>
That they do as ſeriouſly believe, that
the <hi>reaſons</hi> which ſatisfie <hi>themſelves,</hi> are
as ſufficient to ſatisfie <hi>all others,</hi> that uſe
their <hi>moral diligence</hi> for finding ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
as the <hi>ſufferers</hi> believe it concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their <hi>own reaſons,</hi> that they are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to ſatisfie their <hi>Governours;</hi> and
therefore that ſuch diſſenting <hi>hypocritical
Subjects</hi> are as faulty in <hi>not uſing their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence</hi>
in the uſe of the <hi>means,</hi> if they
find not <hi>actual ſatisfaction,</hi> as ſuch <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
believe the ſame concerning their
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:56909:107"/>
               <hi>Governours.</hi> And, 7. That this <hi>perſonal
hypocriſie</hi> of ſuch diſſembling perſons is a
<hi>greater inconvenience</hi> to the <hi>publick,</hi> than
the <hi>toleration</hi> of their <hi>ſeditious behaviour.</hi>
For as it is certain that <hi>Governours</hi> no
more than other <hi>good Chriſtians,</hi> may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
any <hi>ſin</hi> for any <hi>good</hi> whatſoever; ſo
it will not be eaſily diſproved either by
<hi>reaſon or authority of Caſuiſts,</hi> that they
may deſign that from whence they know
a ſin will neceſſarily follow, for the <hi>avoidal
of a greater</hi> both inconvenience and ſin,
ſuch as is <hi>ſedition</hi> in reſpect of <hi>hypocriſie.</hi>
For though it be unlawful to <hi>chooſe any
evil</hi> where it may be avoided; yet it is not
ſo when two occurr, whereof at leaſt one
is <hi>inevitable,</hi> to make choice of the <hi>leſs</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>greater.</hi> And now upon theſe
ſuppoſals it were eaſie to ſhew, from theſe
conditions of <hi>diſſimulation,</hi> that either
there were no neceſſity that the <hi>ſufferers</hi>
under theſe <hi>coercive means</hi> muſt needs
<hi>diſſemble;</hi> or if there were, yet at leaſt not
ſuch as would make it <hi>imputable</hi> as ſin to
<hi>Governours;</hi> or if it were a ſin to them
<hi>abſolutely,</hi> yet not ſuch under ſuch a
<hi>ſtreightned election.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT I muſt avoid prolixity,<note place="margin">§ XXVIII.</note> and
therefore at preſent ſhall onely briefly
make Application to the forementioned
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:56909:108"/>
               <hi>conditions of diſſimulation.</hi> 1. Therefore
it is not neceſſary that every <hi>ſufferer for
his opinions</hi> muſt believe his cauſe to be
<hi>good;</hi> for there are <hi>bad</hi> as well as <hi>good</hi> of
all much received <hi>opinions,</hi> that maintain
them not upon account of their <hi>truth,</hi> but
becauſe they are themſelves <hi>factiouſly</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed,
and love <hi>contradiction,</hi> eſpecially
to <hi>Superiours,</hi> (a humour ſuch people of
the <hi>vulgar</hi> are uſually too much addicted
to) or affect <hi>popularity or ſingularity,</hi> or
promiſe themſelves ſome great <hi>advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>
by publick Innovations and Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances,
or engage in a party out of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to their Friends that are concerned in
it. Much leſs, 2. Is it neceſſary that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one who does indeed <hi>believe</hi> his own
Opinion <hi>true,</hi> muſt do it upon Motives,
ſo much as <hi>apparently conſcientious.</hi> For
<hi>education and cuſtom,</hi> and the <hi>authority</hi> of
a perſon reſpected, or a vainglorious
<hi>oſtentation</hi> of his own Wit, or the <hi>ſhame</hi>
of being miſtaken or convicted, may at
firſt incline many to defend Opinions <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitouſly</hi>
taken up, and afterwards the
<hi>love</hi> of their own <hi>arguments</hi> may delude
many to believe what they have once
aſſerted. And God knows whether the
<hi>vulgar</hi> of moſt Opinions be not acted thus,
whatever pretences they make of <hi>conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:56909:108"/>
(for <hi>cuſtom</hi> may go very far in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
men abhor <hi>unuſual,</hi> innocent, or
commendable things as prophane and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acular,
as appeared in the Experiment of
<hi>Darius Hyſtaſpis in Herodotus,</hi> who found
the <hi>Scythian</hi> to pretend as much <hi>conſcience
for eating,</hi> as the <hi>Grecian for burying</hi> his
dead Relations.) And we have reaſon
to believe, if of too many, whom we
find the moſt zealous maintainers of <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
controverted,</hi> and yet the moſt neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
practiſers of ſuch as are <hi>undoubted,</hi>
which certainly would not be, if <hi>Gods
ſake,</hi> or <hi>conſcience,</hi> or a ſenſe of their own
<hi>duty,</hi> were the <hi>reaſons</hi> inducing them to
<hi>believe</hi> them. Now theſe Deductions
being made, the number of <hi>conſcientious</hi>
Diſſenters would I doubt be generally
found the <hi>ſmaller.</hi> And it is a <hi>general and
juſt</hi> rule of publick proceedings, not to
forbear that which may <hi>generally</hi> do good,
though it may prove <hi>inconvenient and
prejudicial</hi> in ſome rarer Inſtances. Nor
would theſe <hi>coercive means</hi> oblige theſe
Diſſenters upon Motives <hi>not conſcientious</hi>
to <hi>diſſimulation or hypocriſie.</hi> But even for
thoſe <hi>fewer truly conſcientious</hi> Diſſenters
which would remain, it is not neceſſary,
3. That if they have been of a different
Opinion, they ſhould perſevere in it <hi>unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terably.</hi>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:56909:109"/>
And as their minds may <hi>alter</hi>
at any time, ſo as well when they are
<hi>proſecuted</hi> for their Opinions as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
in which caſe their converſion may
be <hi>veracious.</hi> And poſſibly the number
even of <hi>good converts,</hi> even upon ſuch an
occaſion, would be more, if they did not
ſome of them, for fear of being cenſured
as <hi>time-ſervers,</hi> not allow the contrary
Opinion the ſame favour of an <hi>equal hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
when it is countenanced by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
as otherwiſe, or at leaſt not <hi>expreſs</hi>
their ſentiments ſo freely and ingenuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly;
not heeding that hereby inſtead of
<hi>courage and conſtancy,</hi> they onely chooſe
their <hi>conquerour,</hi> being more awed by the
perſecution of the <hi>tongue</hi> than of the <hi>ſword.</hi>
Nor, 4. Is it true, that this <hi>coercion</hi> is not
a <hi>probable means</hi> of bringing even <hi>good men</hi>
to a <hi>conſcientious</hi> change of their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
For, 1. It is of it ſelf likely to allay
that <hi>tumour and rigour</hi> of ſpirit, to which
even <hi>good men</hi> themſelves are frequently
betrayed by <hi>proſperity,</hi> which does uſually
alienate them from all ſober thoughts of
<hi>accommodation,</hi> and even of ſober and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
<hi>inquiry.</hi> And I believe you who
have ſo well ſtudied the <hi>peace of the
Church,</hi> do very well underſtand, that in
very many things mens <hi>ſpirits,</hi> are at a
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:56909:109"/>
greater diſtance than their <hi>principles,</hi> in
all which for making <hi>peace</hi> it is ſufficient
to make men <hi>peaceable.</hi> Indeed for a
while ſuch a way of proceeding may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>exaſperate than calm</hi> them; but by
that time that the <hi>ſtrangneſs</hi> of it is over,
and the ſudden <hi>tumour</hi> has evaporated
and ſpent it ſelf, they are at length redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to a more <hi>compoſed temper.</hi> And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
your own experience, which is great
in the late and preſent poſture of Affairs,
cannot but let you underſtand the much
greater <hi>moderation</hi> of thoſe <hi>Presbyterians</hi>
of your temper and acquaintance <hi>now
than formerly.</hi> For it is natural for men,
as well in wars of <hi>opinions</hi> as of <hi>ſwords,</hi>
when they have wearied themſelves with
<hi>fighting</hi> to deſire <hi>peace.</hi> And, 2. As this
<hi>coercion</hi> brings <hi>good men</hi> themſelves to
this more ſedate and candid temper,
which makes them more competent Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of <hi>rational diſcourſes;</hi> ſo it uſually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges
them to a more faithful and accurate
<hi>inquiry</hi> than formerly. For <hi>good men</hi> can
no more than others endure afflictions
<hi>willingly and patiently,</hi> unleſs they be ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
by the goodneſs of the <hi>cauſe,</hi> and
that they cannot ſo well ſatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of, without an impartial inquiry
into its <hi>merits.</hi> Beſides that <hi>good men</hi>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:56909:110"/>
themſelves, and that reaſonably enough
are unwilling to <hi>ſuffer,</hi> unleſs it be indeed
neceſſary for the preſervation of their
more <hi>momentous intereſts,</hi> and therefore
are willing to admit of any ſatisfactory
favourable <hi>conſtruction</hi> of their <hi>duty,</hi> that
may diſpenſe with ſuch ſevere perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,
which cannot be attained but by
a more cloſe <hi>inquiry</hi> into the <hi>merit</hi> of the
thing, and the <hi>nature</hi> of the Obligation.
And hence it follows, 3. That they muſt
upon <hi>prudential,</hi> and yet <hi>just and rational</hi>
accounts, be favourably enclined to the
Opinions of their <hi>proſecutors,</hi> as far as any
favour may be <hi>juſt and conſcientious.</hi> And
this may do much for determing them in
all ſuch caſes, as are not either very <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>
or very <hi>momentous;</hi> and ſuch not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>many</hi> would be found on a ſevere exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.
And, 4. Affliction does very
much quicken good mens <hi>conſciences,</hi> to
approve themſelves to <hi>God</hi> when they
are deſtitute of <hi>humane conſolations.</hi> And
this alſo may exceedingly contribute to a
<hi>conſcientious</hi> change, when by this they
are freed from thoſe carnal <hi>prejudices,</hi>
which before had blinded or diverted
them from a clear diſcovery, and are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
to a greater <hi>induſtry</hi> in the inquiry
of <hi>means,</hi> and obliged to a greater <hi>ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:56909:110"/>
in following <hi>conviction,</hi> when they
conſider how much their greateſt Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts
are concerned in it, and how vain it
is to hope to eſcape <hi>his</hi> diſcovery in caſe
of <hi>negligence or diſſimulations,</hi> who is the
immediate Lord of <hi>conſcience.</hi> Upon all
theſe accounts therefore <hi>Governours,</hi> who
are to be preſumed to believe their own
Opinions <hi>true,</hi> may juſtly believe <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
coercion</hi> to be a means of reducing
others to them, <hi>conſcientious</hi> as well as
ſuch as are not. But, 5. Though you
might with more plauſibility pretend,
that <hi>diſſimulation</hi> would indeed be the <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
conſequent of coercive means</hi> alone,
they being alone no <hi>rational arguments</hi>
for working a <hi>conſcientious</hi> change; yet
when they are not deſigned as the <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
arguments</hi> inviting to ſuch a change,
but merely as <hi>diſpoſitions to prepare and
qualifie</hi> the perſons for receiving <hi>conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
arguments,</hi> the caſe will be clearly
otherwiſe. Now this I believe you do
already know to be the caſe with us. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
what <hi>coercive means</hi> may have been
pretended, the <hi>means of information</hi> are
freely communicated to any that deſires
them. Our <hi>Books</hi> are extant, our <hi>learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men and Pariſh Miniſters</hi> are freely to
be conſulted with; and why theſe may
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:56909:111"/>
not ordinarily be preſumed likely to
make a conſcientious change, onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
people are neceſſitated to uſe them,
I do not underſtand. And, 6. The caſe
is not ſuch as you have propoſed it.
None was obliged to be <hi>Chriſtian rather
than go to Gaol, &amp;c.</hi> I believe you cannot
inſtance any <hi>Law</hi> lately in uſe, that obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
people to <hi>profeſs</hi> any thing not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
by them. All I think that can be
pretended was to <hi>reſtrain</hi> perſons, not
from the <hi>publick profeſſion,</hi> nor from the
<hi>private practice</hi> of their Opinions; but
onely from practiſing them in <hi>publick or
great aſſemblies,</hi> that might create ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
to the <hi>State.</hi> Otherwiſe I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
reſtrictive of thoſe perſons you are
concerned for, from being commonly
known to be ſuch as they were. And I
pray, what <hi>neceſſity</hi> is there then of <hi>diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation?</hi>
The onely <hi>Canon</hi> of that kind
that I can think of, is that of <hi>communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
once a year at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> the exacting
whereof whether by infliction of <hi>Civil
or Eccleſiaſtical penalties,</hi> whether of <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi>
or even <hi>Conformiſts</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
has been at leaſt where I have
been, ſo generally neglected, that I do not
know any reaſon you have to complain
of it. For any other <hi>coercive means</hi> for
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:56909:111"/>
compelling Diſſenters to communicate
with us, I know none that have been ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly
executed to my knowledge in
<hi>Ireland.</hi> What has been done in <hi>England</hi>
your ſelf know better, and therefore I
ſhall very willingly leave you to your
own information, wherein I hope you
will be ingenuous. Yet, 7. Suppoſe
that <hi>coercive means</hi> were not for the good
of the perſons concerned, but did indeed
make them <hi>Prelatical Chriſtians,</hi> as you
call them, that is, <hi>diſſemblers;</hi> this were
not ſufficient to ſhew that they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not to be uſed, if their <hi>puniſhment and
diſſimulation</hi> it ſelf may prove for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the <hi>publick.</hi> For you know
that <hi>Governours</hi> are not to heed private
advantages any otherwiſe, than in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
and coincidency with the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi>
and that even in civil affairs there
are ſome few <hi>puniſhments</hi> impoſed, which
are known to be utterly inconſiſtent with
the <hi>civil intereſts</hi> of the party puniſhed,
(and their <hi>civil intereſts</hi> are properly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to the care of <hi>Governours</hi>) for
ſuch are all that are <hi>capital,</hi> eſpecially ſuch
of them as are withall <hi>rigorous and painful.</hi>
For in <hi>publick puniſhments</hi> there are other
ends more conſiderable than <hi>private emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi>
namely the prevention of <hi>future
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:56909:112"/>
offences</hi> from the ſame perſon, and the
<hi>terror of others</hi> by his example. Nor is
this way of proceeding blamed by any
<hi>juſt</hi> (however <hi>favourable</hi>) Judge of ſuch
things, when <hi>perſonal emendation</hi> has been
firſt attempted, and no <hi>criminals</hi> are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to ſuch cenſures, but ſuch as have
been found, in the uſe of all other pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential
rational means, <hi>incorrigible.</hi> To
ſuch it is not thought any more cruelty to
be <hi>ſevere</hi> for the <hi>good of the Commonwealth,</hi>
than it is for a <hi>Chirurgeon</hi> to cut off a <hi>gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greened
member</hi> for the preſervation of
its owners <hi>life.</hi> And ſuch is the deſign
of the <hi>Church,</hi> who is not for uſing even
her <hi>ſpiritual coercions</hi> (which onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to her) but onely on ſuch perſons
on whom her <hi>rational inducements</hi> have
proved <hi>deſperate and ſucceſleſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT notwithſtanding your former
contrary intimations you ſay,<note place="margin">§ XXIX</note> 
               <q>You de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
no <hi>force nor Church power;</hi> but not

<hi>no Chriſtians;</hi> 2. who themſelves <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe

               </q> But this <hi>power</hi> you deſire here
is more than that which alone was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by you to <hi>Biſhops,</hi> of <hi>reproving, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting,
inſtructing,</hi> and <hi>declaring perſons
fitneſs or unfitneſs for communion by their
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:56909:112"/>
penitence or impenitence.</hi> For what if
your people believe thoſe penitent whom
you think impenitent, or on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?
What if they be not <hi>ſatisfied</hi> with
your Declarations, or reſolved not to <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve</hi>
them? What if at leaſt the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
part,</hi> which is always predominant in
<hi>popular Governments,</hi> be not of your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion?
Would you think your ſelf obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in ſuch a caſe to make your <hi>peoples</hi>
opinion or your <hi>own,</hi> the <hi>rule of your pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi>
in receiving or rejecting perſons
from your <hi>communion?</hi> If you follow
your <hi>people,</hi> then you are as capable of
being <hi>impoſed on</hi> againſt your will, (for
receiving ſuch perſons for <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and
for part of your <hi>Chriſtian flock,</hi> who are
<hi>no Chriſtians,</hi> and who themſelves <hi>refuſe
it</hi>) by them as you are now by the <hi>Biſhop.</hi>
And it does not appear that the <hi>greater
part</hi> of your flock (eſpecially if ſuch as
you deſcribe, whereof <hi>whole Pariſhes</hi> have
been preſented by the <hi>Churchwardens</hi>) are
likely to ſtand with you in oppoſition to
your <hi>Biſhop.</hi> And if they ſtand for him
againſt you, you can have no reaſon to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude
your own judgment and complain,
according to this principle? But if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
their <hi>diſſent</hi> from you, you
yet reſolve to follow your <hi>own judgment,</hi>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:56909:113"/>
in receiving or rejecting according to
your own thoughts of the <hi>penitence or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence</hi>
of the perſon obnoxious to
your Diſcipline; then you will indeed
be ſo far from deſiring <hi>no Church power,</hi>
as that you would deſire more than you
ſeem willing to grant the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> which
is onely <hi>declarative.</hi> And then if you
may as a <hi>Governour</hi> impoſe on the <hi>people,</hi>
why may not the <hi>Biſhop</hi> as your Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
impoſe on <hi>you?</hi> Indeed there can
be no ſuch thing as Government without
ſuch an Impoſition as you ſpeak of. For
the <hi>reaſon</hi> of all Government is the <hi>ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality</hi>
of mens Judgment in their own
cauſes, and the inconvenience of deciding
their differences <hi>by force,</hi> which is many
times the greateſt on the <hi>unjuſt ſide.</hi> The
deſign therefore of all Government is to
entruſt a <hi>third perſon</hi> or <hi>ſociety,</hi> ſuppoſed
impartial to the litigant parties, with a
power ſufficient to <hi>compel</hi> either of them
to ſubmit to her deciſion. For ſeeing it
is not ordinarily to be expected, that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
ſhould be decided by a <hi>perſuaſion</hi>
of both parties of the <hi>equity</hi> of deciſions,
but that both parties will frequently
prove tenacious of their own Opinions;
therefore it is neceſſary that the <hi>guilty,</hi>
whatever he be, who will ſeldom believe
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:56909:113"/>
his own condemnation juſt, be <hi>impoſed
on;</hi> and ſuch an Impoſition being thus
thought neceſſary, common prudence
will ſuggeſt, that it is much more <hi>equal
and ſecure</hi> for the party impoſed on, that
he be impoſed on by the <hi>common arbitrator</hi>
of their differences than by his partially
affected <hi>adverſary.</hi> And accordingly where
there is no need of <hi>impoſition</hi> there is
none of <hi>government,</hi> and the <hi>ſeat of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
is finally reſolved on them,
who have this power of <hi>impoſing</hi> their
own ſentiments on others; ſo that to
deny <hi>Miniſters</hi> this power over the <hi>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
or the <hi>Biſhops</hi> over the <hi>Miniſters,</hi> is
to make neither the one nor the other
properly <hi>Governours.</hi> Beſides, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of <hi>Excommunication and Abſolution</hi>
(which you ſeem to mean in this your
complaint, that the <hi>independent</hi> uſe of
them is not communicated to the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi>)
are ſo incommunicably proper to
the <hi>ſupreme governour,</hi> (who, as having
the power of a <hi>Society,</hi> muſt alſo have
that of <hi>admitting</hi> to, and <hi>rejecting</hi> mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
from it) as that it were impoſſible
for him to give an account of his charge,
if others may <hi>admit and reject</hi> at pleaſure
without <hi>dependence</hi> on him. So that to
complain of being <hi>impoſed on</hi> in this kind,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:56909:114"/>
is indeed in effect to complain of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
ſuperiority</hi> over you. And if this
reaſon were of any force, it would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
as much againſt the <hi>Presbyterian go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
as the <hi>Epiſcopal,</hi> for even among
them the <hi>Miniſter</hi> may as well be <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted,</hi>
and conſequently <hi>overruled,</hi> by
the <hi>Claſſes,</hi> as with us by the <hi>Biſhops.</hi> So
inſeparable this power of impoſing on
<hi>Pariſh Miniſters</hi> is found from Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as that is indeed admitted by all
them who own a <hi>Government</hi> ſuperiour
to ſingle Pariſhes?</p>
            <p>BUT,<note place="margin">§ XXX.</note> I pray, <hi>quo jure</hi> do you chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
this <hi>Parochial</hi> power of <hi>Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
and Abſolution</hi> independent on
your <hi>Ordinaries?</hi> I ſhall at preſent give
you leave to ſay, (not becauſe that I
think you can prove it, but becauſe I am
unwilling at preſent to diſpute it) that
<hi>Presbyters</hi> were not onely <hi>counſellors,</hi> but
<hi>coordinate governours</hi> with the <hi>Biſhop.</hi>
But how can you ſhew the leaſt likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
that the Biſhop had not at leaſt a
<hi>negative vote</hi> among them? That as he
could not do any thing without their
<hi>ſuffrages,</hi> ſo they were able to conclude
any thing without <hi>his?</hi> Much leſs are
you able to prove, that every <hi>particular
Presbyter,</hi> ſingly taken, ever had within
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:56909:114"/>
his own <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> the power of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
ſo momentous a thing as <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
cenſures.</hi> Whereever you find any
<hi>Preſidents over Presbyteries</hi> in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
whether <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> or
<hi>Angels,</hi> you cannot find any Precedent
of any thing carried by the <hi>major vote</hi>
againſt the conſent of the <hi>Preſident,</hi> as at
leaſt one of the prevailing number. And
for the <hi>Ignatian Epiſcopacy</hi> and ſo down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> which you ſeem to
approve, it is very plain that all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

You ſee here
that even <hi>Presbyters</hi> are not to <hi>take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage</hi>
even of a <hi>youthful Biſhop,</hi> either
for preſuming on too much <hi>familiarity</hi>

is to be obſerved, 1. That no <hi>excluſive
particle</hi> be expreſſed, yet it muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
be underſtood from the whole deſign
of his Diſcourſe, which is to exclude the
<hi>Baptiſm of Hereticks</hi> from being <hi>remiſſive
of ſins,</hi> becauſe the power of <hi>remitting
ſins</hi> is not granted to them, which would
not follow unleſs all which had that <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
conferred on them, had been adequat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enumerated by him. And, 2. That
by the <hi>Churches</hi> here mentioned cannot
be underſtood a <hi>Society contradiſtinct</hi>
from the <hi>Biſhops.</hi> For I believe you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
produce a precedent of <hi>that age,</hi>
where the word is taken for the <hi>other
Clergie;</hi> ſo that there are onely two
other Senſes that I can think of reduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to this purpoſe; either for the <hi>Laity,</hi>
and that your ſelf I believe will not think
intelligible here, that the power of <hi>remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ſins by Baptiſm,</hi> or otherwiſe, does
agree to them; or for the <hi>complex</hi> of
both the <hi>Laity</hi> and the Body of the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,</hi>
in contradiſtinction to the <hi>Biſhop.</hi>
And to this his proof of the <hi>power of
remitting ſins</hi> given to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> being
alſo given to the <hi>Church</hi> in this contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
ſenſe, muſt have been impertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
urged from its being given to the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:56909:118"/>
               <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> ſeeing that the <hi>Church in the
Apoſtles time</hi> muſt have been as contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
from the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> as the <hi>later Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
from their <hi>reſpective Biſhops.</hi> By
the word <hi>Churches</hi> therefore are onely
meant <hi>Orthodox Societies,</hi> including <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi>
as well as other <hi>members;</hi> whence
it will follow, that the <hi>Church</hi> is onely
therefore ſaid to have this <hi>power,</hi> becauſe
the <hi>Biſhops</hi> have it; and therefore that
no <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Member</hi> can have it <hi>inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently</hi>
on them. 3. Therefore that by
the word <hi>Biſhops,</hi> to whom this power of
<hi>remitting ſins</hi> is given, to which all other
<hi>Eccleſiaſtical Power</hi> is conſequent, <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
are not included; will appear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
if you conſider, 1. That though
the word <hi>Presbyter</hi> and <hi>Sacerdos</hi> be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to <hi>Biſhops</hi> properly ſo called, yet at
leaſt in <hi>that age</hi> I believe you will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
find that a ſimple <hi>Presbyter</hi> is called
<hi>Epiſcopus. Blondell</hi> himſelf I think will
not furniſh you with an Inſtance. And,
2. That theſe <hi>Biſhops</hi> are ſuch as are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Succeſſors of the Apoſtles.</hi> And that
by theſe <hi>Succeſſors of the Apoſtles,</hi> ſingle
perſons are underſtood in the language
of that age, appears in that when they
prove <hi>Succeſſion</hi> from the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> they
do it by <hi>catalogues of ſingle perſons,</hi> as
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:56909:119"/>
thoſe in <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian, &amp;c.</hi> and that

them in mind of his being their Superiour,
and charges them with rebellion, when they
took that liberty you deſire of acting arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
and independently.</hi> Inſtances of all
theſe kinds might have been produced, if
I were not afraid of being too tedeous,
Theſe things may at preſent ſuffice to
ſhew, that the liberty you deſire of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
or rejecting whom you pleaſe
from your own flock, is not more <hi>unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable</hi>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:56909:119"/>
than <hi>diſſonant</hi> from the <hi>practice</hi> of
thoſe Ages for which you profeſs a <hi>reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi>
Nor do I underſtand your deſign
in the uſe of that liberty you deſire. If it
be that you would have thoſe whom you
think unworthy of your <hi>flock</hi> excluded
from your <hi>cure;</hi> that is as improper as if
a <hi>Phyſician</hi> ſhould deſire to be excuſed
from viſiting thoſe who are moſt <hi>dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly,</hi>
though not <hi>deſperately,</hi> ſick. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the contrary would rather follow,
that as they need moſt, ſo they ſhould
have moſt of your <hi>care.</hi> It is our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
own ſaying, <hi>that the whole need not a
phyſician, but the ſick;</hi> that is, at leaſt not
<hi>comparatively:</hi> and generally his <hi>greateſt</hi>
pains and favours were extended to thoſe
who had <hi>leaſt</hi> deſerved them. Nor is
their <hi>unwillingneſs</hi> to deal with you in
affairs of this nature a ſufficient reaſon to
exempt them from your Cure; for this
<hi>unwillingneſs</hi> it ſelf is a moſt conſiderable
ingredient in their diſtemper, and that
which makes them moſt <hi>truly pitiable,</hi> and
it would be as great a piece of <hi>inhumanity</hi>
for the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> as the <hi>corporal Phyſician,</hi> to
<hi>deſert</hi> them on that pretence, I am ſure
very different from the behaviour of
<hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who found the
World <hi>generally</hi> as much prejudiced
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:56909:120"/>
againſt and unwilling to hear, them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
affairs of that nature, as you can
with any probability preſume concerning
a <hi>Chriſtian Auditory.</hi> If your meaning
be, not to be excuſed from the uſe of all
other good means for their recovery, but
onely from admitting them to the <hi>bleſſed
Sacrament,</hi> which ought to be the privilege
of ſuch as are already deſerving; I pray
conſider, 1. Whether though you deny
them to be <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> yet their very <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi>
and <hi>exterior profeſſion of Chriſtianity,</hi>
be not at leaſt ſufficient to entitle them to
<hi>exterior privileges,</hi> if on their own peril
they will venture on them; and that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental
privileges</hi> are but <hi>exteriour.</hi>
They are invited to the <hi>marriage feaſt,</hi> and
none may exclude them if they <hi>come,</hi>
though it is at their own <hi>hazard</hi> if they
<hi>preſume</hi> to do ſo without the <hi>marriage gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
And, 2. That this does at leaſt
hold till they be convicted and cenſured
by their due <hi>Superiour,</hi> and you know
it is queſtioned whether <hi>you,</hi> as a private
<hi>Presbyter,</hi> ought to have that <hi>power.</hi>
But, 3. That you have a power of <hi>ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
refractory perſons till you acquaint
the Biſhop, and with him you have that
power of <hi>convincing and perſuading,</hi> which
ſeems as much as your ſelf deſire, ſo that
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:56909:120"/>
even upon this account you have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to complain.</p>
            <p>MY ſecond Argument was from <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
even in Eccleſiaſticals;</hi>
               <note place="margin">§ XXXIII</note> to which you
anſwer, that <q>It's hard then to know
any thing, and that you diſpute all
this while as if the queſtion were, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men in <hi>England ſpeak Engliſh;</hi> that
therefore if you herein erre, you profeſs
your ſelf incurable, and allow me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair
of you.</q> If I had diſputed from
<hi>preſent experience in England,</hi> I ſhould
have confeſſed your Anſwer proper, that
I had endeavour'd to <hi>conquer your ſenſe and
experience,</hi> as you elſewhere expreſs it.
But I wonder how you could underſtand
me ſo, conſidering that our preſent <hi>want
of diſcipline</hi> was the reaſon of my <hi>deſire</hi> of
its <hi>revival,</hi> whence you took the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of theſe Diſputes. My meaning was,
that in the <hi>primitive times,</hi> when <hi>Biſhops</hi>
were indeed <hi>laborious and conſcientious,</hi>
and were willing and deſirous to do what
they could do, <hi>experience</hi> ſhewed that <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline</hi>
was actually maintained under
ſuch a <hi>Dioceſan Government;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I concluded, that the <hi>multitude of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi>
governed was not the reaſon of our
preſent neglects. And what is it that is
ſcrupled in this Diſcourſe, or need put
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:56909:121"/>
you to thoſe unequal reſolutions of being
<hi>uncurable?</hi> Is it whether the number of
<hi>Chriſtians in Dioceſes</hi> were equal then
with what we have now? This was
proved in my former Letter. Or that
the <hi>Biſhop</hi> then challenged the ſame pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
over the <hi>Presbytery</hi> as now? This I
have but lately proved. Or that <hi>diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi>
was then maintained. This I do
not find that you deny. Nay certainly
your ſelf thought <hi>diſcipline</hi> maintainable
under it, when you profeſſed your ſelf
ready to yield to ſuch an Epiſcopacy.
Or that what was then performed by
the <hi>ſame Government,</hi> is ſtill performable,
if men would be the ſame? The admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this would not oblige you to queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your ſelf or experience. Nor indeed
is any thing of this kind concerning <hi>anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi>
as notorious to you, as what men
do at preſent in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FOR proving the great multitudes
then ſubject to Dioceſan Diſcipline I ſaid,<note place="margin">§ XXXIV</note>
               <q>That the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of no City was
thought ſufficient to <hi>multiply Biſhops.</hi>
To this you anſwer, 1. That <hi>Gods Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi>
was, that every <hi>Church</hi> have a
<hi>Biſhop,</hi> for which you quote <hi>Acts</hi> 14.
23. &amp;c.</q> But, 1. The place you refer
me to has no mention of a <hi>Divine Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:56909:121"/>
for <hi>Apoſtolical practice</hi> is not a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
proof of that, and this is all which
is ſo much as intimated in this place.
2. It does not as much as mention the
word <hi>Biſhop,</hi> but that of <hi>Presbyter.</hi> And
though the words were granted to have
been then confounded; yet you know
they were ſo afterwards when the things
were certainly diſtinct. And therefore
you cannot conclude from the word
<hi>Presbyter,</hi> that a <hi>Biſhop</hi> was meant, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in the ſenſe wherein it was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
appropriated. Nor, 3. Is it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is
meant a <hi>ſingle Presbyter</hi> in every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<hi>Church,</hi> as in a <hi>Pariſh;</hi> but it may as
well be meant of <hi>Presbyteries</hi> as <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
And when afterwards the <hi>Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency</hi>
of a <hi>ſingle Monarch</hi> was introduced,
no <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Presbyteries</hi> but ſuch as
had <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and were <hi>Dioceſan</hi> in the
ſenſe we now underſtand the word. And
if they were <hi>Presbyteries,</hi> you cannot
hence diſprove the <hi>preſidency</hi> of one over
the reſt, as we find it ſoon after practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
Nor, 4. Is it evident that by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
muſt needs be meant a <hi>Pariſh,</hi> as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
you to believe. For the word
<hi>Church</hi> is as applicable to great as ſmall
<hi>Societies,</hi> and the great ones may as well
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:56909:122"/>
be called one in their kind, though they
be capable of a further ſubdiviſion into
many <hi>Churches</hi> of ſmaller denomination.
Thus the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> is called one in
the <hi>Conſtantinopolitan Creed,</hi> though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of many <hi>national,</hi> and the <hi>Church
of England</hi> but one <hi>national Church,</hi> though
conſiſting of two <hi>Provincial;</hi> and the
<hi>Province of Canterbury</hi> but one <hi>Provincial
Church,</hi> though conſiſting of ſeveral <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan;</hi>
and every <hi>Dioceſe</hi> but one <hi>Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan</hi>
Church, though conſiſting of ſeveral
<hi>Pariſhes.</hi> And even in the Scripture
there are ſeveral notions of the word of
different proportions. There are the
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and there are the <hi>two or
three gathered in the name of Chriſt,</hi> which
from the <hi>coherence,</hi> and the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>Aſſemblies,</hi> ſeem to make up a
<hi>Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exhort. Caſt.</note> and accordingly <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls
an <hi>Aſſembly of two or three a Church,</hi> though
conſiſting onely of <hi>Laicks.</hi> And yet
theſe <hi>Churches</hi> are ſo little ſerviceable to
your purpoſe, as that I believe you would
not be for confining a <hi>private Presbyter</hi> to
ſo ſmall a <hi>cure,</hi> I am ſure they are much
beneath thoſe populous <hi>Pariſhes</hi> which
you do not ſeem to diſapprove. Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
therefore I ſhould grant you, that
every <hi>diſtinct Church</hi> ſhould have a <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:56909:122"/>
Biſhop;</hi> yet how will you prove
with the leaſt plauſibility, that this
<hi>Church</hi> muſt be underſtood of a <hi>Parochial</hi>
one, that the multitude of <hi>Biſhops</hi> may
anſwer that of <hi>Pariſhes?</hi> Eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
that the notion of the word for a
<hi>Parochial Church</hi> will not be ſo eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
from <hi>Scripture,</hi> as that for a <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſe.</hi>
For thus much the <hi>Independents,</hi> I
think, do prove ſufficiently, that a <hi>whole
Church</hi> in thoſe times did generally meet
in one place; but they fail in proving <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
of Churches in Cities,</hi> though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo <hi>great and populous,</hi> which two put
together do plainly amount to our noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
not of a <hi>Parochial,</hi> but <hi>Dioceſan
Church,</hi> there appearing no footſteps in
thoſe times of any <hi>Subdiviſions</hi> allotted to
<hi>particular Presbyters.</hi> Beſides, if we may

all likelyhood they are; then a <hi>Church</hi>
will be that which will extend to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of a <hi>whole City.</hi> And becauſe you
find no mention of <hi>diſtinct Presbyters for
Villages</hi> recommended to <hi>Titus</hi>'s care it
ſeems very probable that they were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
provided for by thoſe of the <hi>City,</hi>
and therefore that they had ſome depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
on them. That the name of <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>

ſome, that of abſtaining from bloud, <hi>Acts</hi>

under ſuch a Government, which
was the onely thing for whoſe proof I

at <hi>one altar;</hi> whereas indeed the fame

pray, what eſſential difference is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the ſame <hi>Presbyteries,</hi> as acting <hi>in

it not be much more ſo when none is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited

(which is all that you can pretend to

you grant it was, that is ſufficient for

of thoſe times</hi> has evinced the <hi>poſſibility of

and therefore that it is practicable even
<hi>now</hi> if men would but endeavour it. If
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:56909:125"/>
you ſay it was not, you muſt then charge
the moſt <hi>celebrated Churches</hi> in the pureſt

in <hi>Rome</hi> the firſt diviſion into <hi>Titles</hi> (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable

Pope <hi>Euariſtus,</hi>

and then it was not ſo conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient

to ſubdivide into <hi>Pariſhes,</hi> when
there were not any <hi>ſettled places</hi> peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly

there will be no reaſon that the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous

by <hi>Pius,</hi> as left by <hi>Legacy,</hi> ſeem
to have been <hi>perpetually</hi> alienated to the

for this purpoſe. Which if it be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
then the antiquity of <hi>divers Altars</hi>
in the <hi>ſame Dioceſe</hi> will be equal with
<hi>Churches and Pariſhes</hi> which you do not

as you conceive it to have been practiſed
among the <hi>Ancients,</hi> and that <hi>Biſhops</hi>
diſcharged their <hi>duty</hi> as you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
it; yet you would hardly ſuffer
our Controverſies to end ſo, eſpecially if
you acted <hi>conſequently</hi> to your own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.
For you know, by the ſame rule
that <hi>ſmall Cities,</hi> as you have deſcribed

to the abilities of a <hi>ſingle man,</hi>
as ſome of our <hi>Country Dioceſes,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

by your being more <hi>uncharitable,</hi>
which may too probably be the event if
you ſhould prove too tenacious of your

you would be pleaſed to examine, you
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:56909:133"/>
would certainly find your ſelf miſtaken

much more <hi>populous than England,</hi> it is
likely their <hi>Cities</hi> were accordingly fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented.
Nay, moſt of the <hi>Cities</hi> of

               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:56909:133"/>
And conſidering that thoſe <hi>Cities</hi> that

this, the <hi>right of a City</hi> was given to pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

A clear inſtance hereof we have in 13

we find <hi>Anaſtatius Nicaenus</hi> pleading a
a right to <hi>Baſilinopolis,</hi> becauſe it had

<hi>Regions</hi> were, is notorious from the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> into
them) till it was made a <hi>City</hi> by <hi>Julian</hi> or
ſome other Emperour. Here we ſee a place
ſo conſiderable, as that it was afterwards
made a <hi>City,</hi> yet formerly onely a <hi>Ward</hi>
of another City, which <hi>Ward</hi> was in all
likelyhood equivalent our ordinary <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket

<hi>Regions of Nice.</hi> We ſee alſo this <hi>Region</hi>
raiſed to the dignity of a <hi>city</hi> by the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial

the dependence of <hi>Baſilinopolis</hi> on <hi>Nice</hi> by
this argument, that the Emperour who

tranſlated from thence back to <hi>Nice</hi>
again; and that <hi>thus</hi> that which had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
been a <hi>Region</hi> became a <hi>City.</hi>
Where ſeveral things are obſervable to
my purpoſe: 1. That that which made
the <hi>Region</hi> a <hi>City,</hi> was the having <hi>Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>officers</hi>
of their own, whence it appears
that <hi>Courts</hi> were appropriated to <hi>Cities,</hi>
and that therefore all other <hi>Towns</hi> not
thus <hi>privileged</hi> muſt have been ſubject to
the Juriſdiction of the <hi>Cities.</hi> 2. That
theſe <hi>Courts</hi> were granted by ſpecial
Charter of the <hi>Emperour.</hi> And, 3. that
the <hi>borrowing theſe Officers from another
City,</hi> if conſtantly obſerved, ſignified
ſome <hi>ſecular dependence</hi> of ſuch a place on
ſuch a <hi>City,</hi> from whence they were bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed.
And now I pray what an ſuch a
<hi>Town walled, incorporated, and having Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction,
not onely over Suburbs, but a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of the Villages and Towns adjacent,
by ſpecial Imperial Charters,</hi> want of our
modern notion of a <hi>City,</hi> even as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinct
to our <hi>Market Towns?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND that the <hi>Government of the
Church</hi> was proportioned to that of the
<hi>State</hi> is ſo commonly obſerved by learned
Men,<note place="margin">§ XLIII</note> as that I cannot think it neceſſary
to be tedeous in proving it. And that in
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:56909:136"/>
this very particular of the <hi>ſubjection</hi> of

               </gap> to the <hi>City Biſhop,</hi>
appears from the 17th. Canon of this
<hi>ſame Council,</hi> where it is not onely for
this, but all other affairs of a like nature,
eſtabliſhed as a general Rule, (very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
occaſioned by the forementioned
Controverſie;) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
And though we had no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
Teſtimony, yet the <hi>multitude</hi> of the

their ordinary <gap reason="foreign">

or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and all ſubject to the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Biſhop,</hi> do plainly ſhew that the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
Juriſdiction,</hi> if not as large as <hi>now,</hi>
was at leaſt much larger than our <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Market Towns,</hi> which uſually have
but <hi>one Pariſh,</hi> and are therefore thought
ſufficiently governable by an <hi>ordinary
ſingle Presbyters.</hi> And this form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
<hi>Cities</hi> was ſo univerſal, as that
your Aſſertion to the contrary is not
credible even in <hi>Africa,</hi> or any other
place where <hi>Biſhops</hi> or <hi>Cities</hi> are obſerved
to have been moſt <hi>frequent or numerous:</hi>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:56909:136"/>
But if it had indeed been otherwiſe in
ſome ſingular places, yet it is plain that
the general rate of <hi>Cities</hi> among the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients</hi>
was equal to ours. Whence it
will follow, that the <hi>Dioceſes</hi> generally
deſigned were ſuch as <hi>ours are now,</hi> though
in ſome particular more anomalous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
they were (it may be) as ſmall
as you would have them. Whence two
things will follow very appoſite to my
deſign: 1. That the Judgment of thoſe
Ages themſelves were certainly more for
<hi>us</hi> than <hi>you,</hi> ſeeing their <hi>judgment</hi> is onely
to be concluded from their <hi>general rules,</hi>
not from their particular <hi>anomalous pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices.</hi>
And, 2. that the caſe of <hi>diſcipline</hi>
muſt have been the ſame with <hi>them</hi> as
<hi>us.</hi> For the <hi>general</hi> obſervation of <hi>diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi>
cannot be effected by <hi>ſingular,</hi> but
<hi>general practices and deſigns.</hi> Whence it
will be eaſie to infer, that if <hi>diſcipline</hi>
was then generally obſerved, then it is
obſervable under a <hi>Dioceſan Government,</hi>
in the ſenſe we are now diſputing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it. For ſuch I have proved to
have been generally <hi>practiſed</hi> then, and
if it was <hi>obſerved</hi> then, you can give
no diſparity why it may not be ſo <hi>now,</hi>
if <hi>Governours</hi> would be equally <hi>induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi>

quality of the <hi>perſons ſeduced,</hi> and the

being more directly prejudicial to the

office as <hi>Governours.</hi> They think
that which is called <hi>faithful preaching of

<hi>Goſpel,</hi> (for God be praiſed we do not
differ in Subjects of that kind, but men

is by ſo much the more <hi>dangerous</hi> by how

ſuch as is that now mentioned; ſo
that though themſelves may believe them
faithful in other things, yet in this they
are far from thinking them ſo, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as far from proſecuting them as
<hi>faithful Preachers.</hi> And I believe your
ſelf will hardly pretend, that their <hi>fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
in ſome things muſt excuſe their <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs</hi>
in others. Or do you mean,
that perſons of a <hi>pious converſation and
conſcientious,</hi> muſt not be driven to that
which they <hi>think ſin,</hi> or from that which
they <hi>think faithful Preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel?</hi>
If you mean that all truly <hi>pious

may be reconcilable with the

before the <hi>private</hi> of any <hi>ſingle perſon</hi>
how <hi>pious</hi> ſoever; I could for my part
heartily wiſh it were ſo too, and I believe
moſt of the <hi>Biſhops do practice</hi> according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

have entertained ſuch a <hi>good opinion,</hi> and
do endeavour to ſhew the ſame <hi>charitable</hi>
demeanour to them on <hi>earth,</hi> which they
think God will in <hi>heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT,<note place="margin">§ XLVI</note> Sir, you know that they who
are indeed free from <hi>carnal vices,</hi> and ſuch
as are obnoxious to obſervation, may yet
be guilty of <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Obſtinacy in
yielding to conviction,</hi> or <hi>Diſobedience to

too much prejudice or averſation to the
<hi>perſons or reaſons</hi> of their <hi>adverſaries,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they have given them an <hi>equal hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
or ſome ſuch other prejudice, which
unawares ſeduces the very <hi>beſt and wiſeſt

accounts may be diſcerned and judged
by their <hi>Superiours,</hi> from their perverſe
demeanour under thoſe <hi>milder Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
And when it is diſcerned, though
their innocence as to <hi>carnal crimes</hi> may
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:56909:140"/>
indeed, in prudence and charity, be
thought ſufficient for the <hi>expiation or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terition</hi>

than their <hi>virtues</hi> are eminent, and
of ſuch a kind would <hi>Schiſm and Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi>
appear to ſuch as would equally
and ſoberly conſider them. But ſuppoſe
that <hi>Governours</hi> do indeed believe, that

profeſs, and conceive themſelves obliged
<hi>in conſcience</hi> to deny their <hi>due obedience,</hi>
and to follow thoſe <hi>factious courſes</hi> they

could have been animated by nothing
to ſuch deſperate enterprizes, but onely
a ſtrong perſuaſion of the <hi>goodneſs of their

And yet you would not think <hi>that</hi> a

them for the terror of others, with <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
afflictions,</hi> whom he intends to ſpare
in the <hi>world to come.</hi> A clear example
hereof we have in <hi>David, 2 Sam.</hi> 12. 13,
14. where after his ſins of murdering
<hi>Uriah,</hi> and defiling <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> had been

that becauſe by this deed he had given
occaſion to <hi>the enemies of God to blaſpheme;</hi>
the <hi>child</hi> that had been born of that

And therefore <hi>good men</hi> themſelves, when

                  </gap>
example,</hi> may <hi>in this life</hi> be puniſhed for
the good of others. And, 3. <hi>God</hi> himſelf
cannot be thought <hi>merciful</hi> to men <hi>good</hi>
for all other things, and <hi>peccant</hi> onely in
one kind, eſpecially if of ſo <hi>heinous a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
as <hi>Schiſm</hi> without their <hi>repentance,</hi>
either <hi>particular</hi> by an actual explicite
confeſſion and reformation of it when
known; or general and implicite, and <hi>in

of all <hi>moral means</hi> of diſcovery, and
to reform what might be <hi>convicted</hi> by
ſuch diſcovery how <hi>dear</hi> ſoever other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
And this you know is the caſe of
the <hi>Church</hi> in puniſhing well meaning
perſons who are guilty of <hi>Schiſm.</hi> It is
plain, that they are ſo far from being <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent</hi>
for what ſhe thinks to be <hi>ſin,</hi> as
that they <hi>defend</hi> it, and <hi>draw others</hi> to it.
And as to <hi>general repentance,</hi> ſhe thinks
ſhe has not reaſon to believe it in them,
when upon propoſal of her <hi>reaſons</hi> they
ſhew themſelves <hi>perverſe,</hi> and <hi>factious,</hi>
and <hi>incorrigible.</hi> If it be pretended, that
the Church may be <hi>miſtaken in cenſures,</hi>
I pray conſider, 4. That ſhe muſt act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to her <hi>own conſcience,</hi> though <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous;</hi>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:56909:141"/>
and though <hi>God</hi> may prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
indulgent to many perſons, whom
he as a <hi>ſearcher of their hearts</hi> may know
to be <hi>penitent;</hi> yet the <hi>Church</hi> being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to accommodate her demeanour to
them, to her <hi>own knowledge,</hi> may at the
ſame time <hi>juſtly and commendably</hi> proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
them, if they ſeem otherwiſe to
her. And I believe you will find it a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
occaſion of your <hi>miſtakes</hi> in this
kind, that you look upon <hi>Superiors</hi> as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to act according to your <hi>own private

YOU anſwer,<note place="margin">§ XLVII.</note> 8.<q> That I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that <hi>great Cities</hi> had long but
<hi>few Chriſtians</hi> in compariſon of the
<hi>Heathens</hi> till <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s time, and
moſtly <hi>long after.</hi>
               </q> But, 1. Though this
had indeed been <hi>true,</hi> yet it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that the <hi>Government</hi> muſt have been
proportioned onely to the neceſſities of
thoſe <hi>few,</hi> both becauſe <hi>Heathens</hi> as well
as <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> the reducing of <hi>Infidels,</hi> as
well as the government of <hi>Believers,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to <hi>their charge.</hi> Which muſt
have been by ſo much <hi>greater</hi> rather than
<hi>leſs,</hi> as there was much more <hi>difficulty</hi> in
reducing one from his <hi>vicious</hi> practiſes
as well as his opinions, to the ſevere rules
of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> than to <hi>govern many,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
ſuch good and excellent perſons as
<hi>Converts</hi> were generally in thoſe times,
when actually reduced; and becauſe
<hi>Chriſtianity</hi> was in a <hi>growing</hi> condition,
and therefore the <hi>Government</hi> was to be
proportioned to their <hi>future hopes,</hi> as well
as their <hi>preſent fruitions.</hi> But, 2. The
ſuppoſition, That <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were ſo few
till <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s time or afterwards, is a
great miſtake. In the <hi>Church of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
we find 3000 converted by <hi>one Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
Acts</hi> 11. 41. beſides thoſe who had

to have been very many, by the
<hi>multitude</hi> that ſung <hi>Hoſannahs</hi> before

the terror of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who durſt

<hi>Acts</hi> 9. 31. And in the ſame

20. Yet were all theſe under ſingle Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
S. <hi>James</hi> and his Succeſſors, as
far as <hi>Hiſtory</hi> can inform us, though in
all likelyhood this number was vaſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed,
when moſt of the <hi>refractory
Jews,</hi> who moſt of all hindered <hi>the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
of the Goſpel,</hi> were deſtroyed in the
Siege of <hi>Titus,</hi> and generally baniſhed,
when it was reedified by <hi>Adrian,</hi> and by
him called <hi>Aelia.</hi> This is very obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
becauſe it is moſt likely to have been
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:56909:143"/>
eſtabliſhed by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> as a <hi>patern</hi> for
other Cities. But it was not herein <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular</hi>
even in thoſe times; for <hi>Samaria</hi>
ſeems generally to have been converted.
This appears, in that <hi>all the people</hi> are ſaid
to have been deceived by <hi>Simon Magus,
Acts 8. 9. all from the leaſt to the greateſt,
ver.</hi> 10. and the ſame number ſeems to
have been converted by S. <hi>Philip,</hi> and to
have been baptized <hi>both men and women,
ver.</hi> 12. and therefore <hi>Samaria</hi> is ſaid to
have <hi>received the word of God, ver.</hi> 14.
Now the <hi>leaſt</hi> that can be underſtood by
theſe expreſſions is, that much the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
part received the faith,</hi> which muſt
have very much exceeded the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of a ſingle ſolitary perſon. In the
Church of <hi>Antioch Ignatius</hi> his charge,
(by which you in ſome part underſtand
the <hi>extent of the Dioceſan Government</hi>
mentioned in his Epiſtles) a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
is ſaid to have <hi>believed, Acts</hi> 11. 21.
and after <hi>Barnabas</hi> his coming, <hi>much peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
is ſaid to have been <hi>added to the Lord,
ver.</hi> 24. who are therefore to have been
ſuppoſed <hi>diſtinct</hi> from the former. And
again, <hi>ver. 26. Saul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for a year together taught <hi>much peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
who there firſt received the name of
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> very probably from the <hi>great
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:56909:143"/>
multitudes</hi> obſervable there above other
places adjacent, which could hardly have
been ſo likely, if they had not held ſome
great proportion to the Inhabitants,
which if they did muſt have very much
exceeded our ordinary <hi>Parochial Cures.</hi>
For <hi>Antioch</hi> was the <hi>third City</hi> of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Empire</hi> in <hi>Secular</hi> as well as <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
Dignity;</hi> ſo in <hi>Antiochia Piſidiae</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>religious Proſelytes</hi>
followed <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas, Acts</hi> 13. 43.
And afterwards <hi>almoſt all the City came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to hear the word of God, ver.</hi> 44. and
with what event may be conceived from
that which follows, <hi>ver. 48, 49. That the
Gentiles were glad, and glorified the word of
the Lord; and as many as were ordained, to
eternal life believed: and that the word of
the Lord was publiſhed in all regions.</hi>
Which, beſides the oppoſition mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
onely by the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>devout and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
women,</hi> (that is, <hi>Proſelyteſſes of
the Gates,</hi> as ſome underſtand) acted by
them, <hi>ver.</hi> 50. muſt imply the <hi>number</hi> of
<hi>Converts</hi> to have been extremely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
in proportion to the whole,
which muſt have included a great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
this City being a <hi>Metropolis of a
Province.</hi> In <hi>Theſſalonica ſome</hi> (of the
<hi>Jews) believed, and of the devout Greeks a
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:56909:144"/>
great multitude, and of the chief women not
a few, Acts</hi> 17. 4. And in <hi>Beraea,</hi> another
remarkable City, they were <hi>more noble
than thoſe of Theſſaloniea, ver.</hi> 11. And
accordingly <hi>many of the Jews believed;
alſo of honourable women which were Greeks,
and of men not a few, v.</hi> 12. In <hi>Epheſus</hi> S. <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi>'s
Dioceſe, S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf diſputeth
firſt <hi>three moneths in the Synagogue, Acts</hi>
19. 8. afterwards <hi>two years in the ſchool of

(that is, the <hi>Lydian or Proconſular,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<hi>Epheſus</hi> was the <hi>Metropolis) heard the
word of the Lord Jeſus, both Jews and
Greeks, ver. 9. 10. fear came upon all of
them; and the name of the Lord Jeſus was
magnified, ver.</hi> 17. And you may gueſs at
the great <hi>multitude of Converts</hi> by the
vaſt ſumme which their <hi>conjuring books</hi>
then burnt were valued at, 50000 <hi>pieces
of ſilver, v.</hi> 19. which is obſerved by the
<hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> himſelf, as an Argument how
<hi>mightily the word of God grew and prevailed,
ver.</hi> 20. And it muſt argue a very <hi>great
number,</hi> conſidering that <hi>books</hi> were a
commodity which is not to have been
preſumed a conſiderable part of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of each, much leſs of that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<hi>ſubject,</hi> (however the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
be celebrated among the Ancients) and
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:56909:144"/>
the total number of the perſons concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
muſt needs be greater, by how much
the particular proportions to be diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
among them are likely to have been
<hi>leſs to the particulars;</hi> and it is according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obſervable, that no <hi>particular</hi> is noted
to have been conſiderably <hi>impoveriſhed</hi> by
ſo great a loſs.</p>
            <p>THESE are the moſt remarkable
<hi>Cities</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Acts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§ XLVIII</note> which we
have reaſon to believe to have abounded
with <hi>numbers of Chriſtians,</hi> too great for
the Cure of a <hi>ſingle perſon.</hi> And it is to
be conſidered, that as in their <hi>preaching</hi>
you find little mention of their <hi>preaching
in villages,</hi> but in <hi>Cities;</hi> ſo it is moſt
credible that they left <hi>them</hi> to the <hi>care of
the Government</hi> eſtabliſhed in the <hi>Cities.</hi>
Whence it will follow, that the <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical</hi>
as well as the <hi>Secular</hi> Government
of <hi>Villages</hi> depended on the <hi>Cities,</hi> and
that therefore they were <hi>Dioceſes</hi> in the
modern extent, and that the <hi>Government</hi>
eſtabliſhed in <hi>Cities</hi> ſeems to have been
moſt agreeable to the deſign of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</hi>
And of all <hi>Cities</hi> thoſe are to be
ſuppoſed moſt accurately provided for
by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> which were converted
by their <hi>perſonal preaching,</hi> and which in
their times had <hi>numbers</hi> ſufficient for <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;</hi>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:56909:145"/>
and therefore if other <hi>places</hi>
had deviated from the examples of theſe,
as thoſe in <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> which
you cannot prove to have been convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> you ought rather to
have corrected thoſe by theſe, than as
you prepoſterouſly do, to confine the
<hi>Dioceſes</hi> converted and eſtabliſhed by the
<hi>Apoſtles,</hi> to the dimenſions of them which
were not. But beſides theſe <hi>Scripture
Arguments</hi> evincing the great <hi>number of
Chriſtians,</hi> even in the times of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi>
themſelves; another may be drawn
from the <hi>multitudes of Hereſies,</hi> which
muſt have needs drawn great numbers
from the Church, not onely that ſwarm
which roſe immediately after the <hi>deceaſe
of the Apoſtles,</hi> as the <hi>Baſilidians, Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,
&amp;c.</hi> but alſo thoſe who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary
with the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelves
as the <hi>Simonians, Nicolaitans, Ebionites,
Corinthians, &amp;c.</hi> For though ſome few
of theſe did, even in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> times
themſelves, ſeparate, as is clear from
1 <hi>John</hi> 11. 19. and ſeveral other places
of the <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> where they are blamed
and confuted, and the <hi>multitudes</hi> of them
that periſhed in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the <hi>Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity;</hi>
yet moſt of them did then act
more <hi>covertly,</hi> and were followed by
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:56909:145"/>
               <hi>ſmaller parties,</hi> in regard of what was
done after the <hi>deceaſe of the Apoſtles,</hi>
which is the reaſon why <hi>Hegeſippus in
Euſebius</hi> calls the Church <hi>a pure Virgin</hi>
till the time of <hi>Trajan,</hi> in whoſe time
S. <hi>John</hi> the laſt of them died, not long
after his return from <hi>Patmos.</hi> Now if
the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were ſo <hi>numerous,</hi> as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
they were, even after theſe dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of their own members by <hi>relapſe,</hi>
and the hinderance of the converſion of
others, whom we find to have been <hi>alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated</hi>
at a greater diſtance by this ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
of the multitude of their <hi>Sects,</hi> (for
about that time we find it objected by
<hi>Celſus,</hi> who wrote his Book againſt the
Chriſtians under <hi>Hadrian,</hi> the immediate
Succeſſor of <hi>Trajan,</hi> if we may believe
<hi>Origen</hi>) we cannot think their number
ſo ſmall as you conceive in the times of
the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> when they did not labour
under theſe diſadvantages. But when
they had overcome theſe difficulties, and
were exerciſed with new <hi>perſecutions,</hi> it
is ſtrange how exceedingly they <hi>encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi>
In <hi>Severus</hi> his time, about the Year
of our Lord 201,<note place="margin">Sect. 37. &amp; Anno 200. Sect. 7.</note> according to <hi>Baronius,
Tertullian</hi> wrote his <hi>Apologie,</hi> which was
above 100 years before <hi>Conſtantine;</hi> yet
even then there were ſuch multitudes of
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:56909:146"/>
               <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as that he prefers them before
the <hi>Moors,</hi> and <hi>Marcomans,</hi> and <hi>Parthians;</hi>
as being ſpread over all the <hi>Roman world.</hi>
His words, though they be ſo known that
I wonder that you forgot them, yet
are withall ſo very pertinent and full
to my purpoſe, as that I think it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to tranſcribe them; thus therefore he
is in <hi>Cap. 37. Apolog. Plures nimirum Mauri

you ſee <hi>Cities,</hi> and throughout the <hi>whole

of them. What can be more contrary
to your Aſſertion? Yet <hi>fulneſs</hi> may be
underſtood with a latitude, for a <hi>great,</hi>
though not the <hi>greateſt</hi> number. But
that he underſtood the <hi>greateſt,</hi> will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appear from what he afterwards adds;

Certainly they whoſe very <hi>ſeceſſion</hi> would

what can be clearer than that?
(notwithſtanding what allowances may
be made for the <hi>confidence of the man,</hi> and

ſo far from being few in compariſon

<hi>ſuperfluities</hi> than now, when not

then as this ſumm of 100000 <hi>Seſtertia</hi> is
in a parallel caſe granted by <hi>Seneca,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Conſo. ad Helv. c. 10</note>

It being therefore ſo well atteſted by the

in it ſelf. And then for diſcerning the
pregnancy of this Teſtimony I pray conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
1. That this <hi>Epiſtle of Pliny</hi> is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tertul. Apol. Euſeb. Chron. num. 2223 Oroſ. l. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Euſebius,</hi> and <hi>Oroſius;</hi> ſo
that there can be no doubt of its being
<hi>genuine.</hi> Conſider, 2. That this Epiſtle
was certainly written very ſoon after
S. <hi>John</hi>'s death, who died in <hi>Trajan</hi>'s
time, (<hi>Baronius</hi> places S. <hi>John</hi>'s death in
the ſecond year of <hi>Trajan,</hi> and the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of this Epiſtle in the fifth or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts;)
and therefore the words <hi>diu
intermiſſa</hi> will in all likelihood extend
the <hi>paucity of Heathens</hi> in thoſe parts to
S. <hi>Johns</hi> time, at leaſt certainly very long
before your Period of <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> 3. That
this Church of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> of which <hi>Pliny</hi>
gives account being his <hi>own Province,</hi>
was converted in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> times, as
appears 1 S. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 1. and therefore the

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:56909:153"/>
               <hi>Sees</hi> which were undoubtedly founded
by the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> Yet it cannot even here
be ſhewn, that ever <hi>one City</hi> had more
than <hi>one preſiding Biſhop.</hi> 4. That this
Teſtimony is of an <hi>Adverſary,</hi> whoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
had been to have made the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
more deſpicable</hi> by concealing their
numbers, if he could have done it veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.
And, 5. That as <hi>Pliny</hi> muſt in all
probability be preſumed <hi>veracious</hi> in tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
what he knew, ſo he had means of
knowing what was <hi>really true,</hi> being <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of the Province,</hi> and having actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
made enquiry after the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in
their <hi>perſecutions</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>I BELIEVE the great reaſon that
inclines you to believe the <hi>paucity of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
in thoſe times</hi> is,<note place="margin">§ LII.</note> that in <hi>great and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
Cities</hi> they were able to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
at <hi>one Altar,</hi> upon which account
you conceive them to have been no more
than what may aſſemble in our ordinary
<hi>Parochial Congregations.</hi> But you might as
well have concluded <hi>whole Cities</hi> indeed,
nay <hi>whole Nations,</hi> to have no more people
in them than our ordinary <hi>Parochial Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies.</hi>
You know every <hi>clean Male in
Jewry</hi> was to appear before God at the
two ſolemn Feaſts of <hi>Eaſter</hi> and of <hi>Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles,</hi>
whoſe numbers computed by <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtius
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:56909:153"/>
Gallus,</hi> amounted to a number ſure
too great for a <hi>Pariſh,</hi> and the number in
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> when beſieged by <hi>Titus,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
there upon occaſion of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> is a
plain Argument of the vaſtneſs of their
<hi>religious Aſſemblies.</hi> Nor was it onely
proper to the <hi>Jews</hi> thus to confederate
and unite their <hi>Commonwealth</hi> by their
Conventions on account of <hi>Religion</hi> to
partake of the <hi>ſame Altar,</hi> but the ſame
Policy was obſerved among the <hi>Heathens.</hi>
The Aſſemblies of <hi>whole Cities</hi> are ſo ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
that it were but <hi>pedantick</hi> to give
inſtances of them. For thoſe of <hi>Nations</hi>
you may obſerve the <hi>Athenian Panathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naicks,</hi>
the <hi>Olympick</hi> Solemnities which
were of all <hi>Greece,</hi> and then the <hi>Panio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>
of the <hi>Aſiatick Iones,</hi> not now to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thoſe of the <hi>Barbarians.</hi> Nor were
onely <hi>Sacrifices</hi> common to theſe vaſt
Aſſemblies from the <hi>ſame Altar,</hi> which is
more eaſily intelligible, but <hi>ſpeeches</hi> alſo
were made to <hi>numbers</hi> much greater than
our <hi>Parochial Aſſemblies,</hi> which I believe
you will think the greater difficulty,
how the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> who you ſay then was
the <hi>principal,</hi> if not the <hi>onely Preacher,</hi>
ſhould be heard in a Multitude proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
to a <hi>populous City.</hi> Yet is this ſo
far from being <hi>incredible,</hi> as that it was
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:56909:154"/>
in thoſe Ages frequently practiſed. I
will not inſtance in places of ſpecial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance,
as that at the <hi>Roman Roſtra,</hi> the
<hi>Theatres,</hi> and <hi>Amphitheatres,</hi> where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thouſands, ſometimes 100000 or
more, have heard with convenience.
And yet it is very probable, that theſe
publick places of <hi>religious Aſſemblies</hi> were
contrived with conveniency for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
Nay it is certain, that the <hi>Jews</hi>
had their <hi>Suggeſta</hi> and <hi>Cathedrae</hi> raiſed on
high for that end. Nor ſhall I mention the
<hi>Orations of Generals</hi> to their <hi>Armies,</hi> who
had the like advantages. It is very clear
that upon occaſions not ſo ſolemn nor
prepared, great Routs of tumultuous
people, wanting <hi>heads</hi> to whom a <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
addreſs</hi> might have been confined,
have yet been ſpoken to. I will not
again inſtance in the Speeches of <hi>Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
and King <hi>Agrippa</hi> to the generality
of the <hi>Jewiſh Nation,</hi> of which we are
diſcourſing. <hi>Scripture Examples,</hi> though
purely <hi>hiſtorical,</hi> I find moſt eaſily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by you, and therefore I am the
rather willing to inſiſt on them. <hi>Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi>
ſpeaks to all <hi>Iſrael, 1 Kings</hi> 12. 1, 13,
16, 20. So <hi>Jehoiada</hi> makes a covenant
with all the people of the Land, 2 <hi>Kings</hi>
11. 17, 18, 20. Our Saviour preaches his
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:56909:154"/>
Sermon on the Mount to great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
from ſeveral places, S. <hi>Matth. 4. 25.
v.</hi> 1. And ſeveral other places, to 4000
at one time, and 5000 at another, though
in <hi>wilderneſſes;</hi> by which we may gueſs
how much <hi>greater</hi> his Auditories were in
<hi>populous Cities.</hi> The <hi>Town Clerk of the
Epheſians</hi> to the <hi>whole City, Acts</hi> 19. 29,
35. S. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>all the City of Jerusalem,
Acts</hi> 21. 30, 36, 39, 40. And by the <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes</hi>
converted by ſingle Sermons of
the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> you may eaſily conjecture
the <hi>vaſtneſs</hi> of their <hi>Auditories.</hi> Which
will be the rather credible when it is
conſidered, that the principal <hi>preaching</hi>
of the firſt Propagators of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi>
was generally in places of <hi>greateſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,</hi>
ſuch as the <hi>Temple,</hi> or <hi>Synagogues,</hi>
or <hi>Streets,</hi> or or <hi>Schools,</hi> or <hi>Market-places.</hi>
Thus you ſee that it will not follow, that
the <hi>number of Chriſtians</hi> muſt have been
<hi>few,</hi> if they aſſembled in <hi>one place</hi> for the
<hi>Word and Sacraments,</hi> and if the <hi>Biſhop
alone</hi> had preached.</p>
            <p>BUT neither <hi>ſuppoſition</hi> is ſo very
certain,<note place="margin">§ LIII.</note> at leaſt not ſo general, as you
ſeem to believe it. For <hi>preaching,</hi> we ſee
that while the extraordinary <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of
<hi>prophecy</hi> laſted, under which <hi>preaching</hi>
was comprehended as well as <hi>prayer,</hi>
               <pb n="292" facs="tcp:56909:155"/>
(which by the way is obſervable againſt
them who allow <hi>ſtudied Sermons,</hi> and yet
complain of the <hi>Spirit</hi>'s being quenched
if their <hi>prayers</hi> be other than <hi>extempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>)
ſeveral <hi>Prophets</hi> met and officiated in
their <hi>Synaxes, 1 Cor.</hi> 14. 29, 30, 31. ſo far
was it then from being confined to any
perſon; <hi>Biſhop</hi> or other, to preach to the
people. And even afterwards we find
<hi>preaching</hi> not always performed by the
<hi>Biſhop,</hi> though I am apt indeed to think
it was ordinarily. The <hi>Catechiſts</hi> were
uſually <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and <hi>Origen,</hi> though a
<hi>Presbyter,</hi> yet preached before <hi>Biſhops.</hi>
But for the times of <hi>perſecution,</hi> wherein
they could not meet ſo <hi>numerouſly</hi> in one
Aſſembly; yet other proviſions might
have been made agreeably enough to the
Principles of thoſe Ages, for ſupplying
the neceſſities of much greater than <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial
multitudes.</hi> Such was that of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
the ſpecies,</hi> which I believe was a
ſhift found out in times of <hi>perſecution,</hi>
when every <hi>particular perſon</hi> could not
get any opportunity of frequenting the
<hi>Synaxes</hi> as often as he was deſirous to
<hi>communicate,</hi> which was then <hi>daily,</hi> it
being the firſt meat they taſted. This
<hi>reſervation</hi> is clear from S. <hi>Cyprian de
lapſ.</hi> the Author <hi>De Spectaculis</hi> among
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:56909:155"/>
his works, <hi>Tert. l.</hi> 11. and <hi>Ux. Dionyſ. Alex.
ep. ad Fab. Antioch. in Euſeb.</hi> S. <hi>Iren.</hi> to Pope
<hi>Victor.</hi> Now by this means very great
multitudes might frequently <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,</hi>
though their <hi>Synaxes</hi> were rarely
and thinly celebrated, that they might
not give their <hi>Governours</hi> any juſt offence
by their <hi>numerouſneſs.</hi> For by <hi>Pliny</hi>'s
Epiſtle to <hi>Trajan</hi> it appears, that they
did upon this account utterly forbear
their <hi>feaſts of charity,</hi> upon his putting
of the Law <hi>De Hetaeriis</hi> in force; and in
all probability yielded as far as lawfully
they conceived they might in the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt</hi>
it ſelf. A ſecond ſhift was that of
<hi>ſending the Sacraments by the Deacons</hi> to
thoſe that were abſent. So S. <hi>Juſtin
Martyr</hi> expreſly,<note place="margin">Apol. 11. p. 97.</note>

               <gap reason="foreign">

And who knows whether the <hi>breaking of

               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>from houſe to houſe,</hi> as
we read it <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 46. (if it be meant of
the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and not rather of their
<hi>feaſts of love</hi>) may not allude to this <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom?</hi>
I ſhall not now diſpute it, but
onely obſerve that this practice, though
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:56909:156"/>
not grounded on this Text, yet certainly
uſed in thoſe times, might from <hi>the ſame
Altar</hi> have communicated much greater
<hi>multitudes</hi> than are contained in our <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Pariſhes.</hi> But there was alſo a third
Expedient for theſe <hi>numerous Communions,</hi>
that though indeed the <hi>Roman Altar,</hi>
where the <hi>bleſſed Sacrament</hi> was ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
and ſolemnly adminiſtred, were
<hi>onely one,</hi> even in thoſe <hi>populous Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
and that in the power of the <hi>Biſhop;</hi>
yet in private and occaſional Aſſemblies
<hi>Presbyters</hi> were permitted to do it by
<hi>leave of the Biſhop,</hi> without any prejudice
to the <hi>Unity of the Church,</hi> which was
ſignified by the <hi>Unity of their Altar.</hi> I
will not mention the inſtances hereof in
the <hi>Acts of the Martyrs,</hi> which are not ſo
ſecure to be truſted. <hi>Ignatius</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>
are very clear to this purpoſe in
the places already produced. Now this
account being given how, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>multitude of Communicants,</hi> and
though the <hi>Sacrament</hi> were the greateſt
obligation to meet in <hi>publick Aſſemblies,</hi>
yet much greater <hi>numbers</hi> than our <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes</hi>
might have been ſupplied conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
enough from <hi>one Preſident and one
Altar;</hi> it will be eaſie to give an account
of other things. For as for <hi>preaching,</hi>
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:56909:156"/>
which is now more inſiſted on as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of <hi>Church Aſſemblies</hi> than the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
though certainly very differently
from the ſenſe of thoſe <hi>Ages.</hi> Firſt, you
cannot prove that to have been ſo <hi>appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
to the Biſhop,</hi> as that <hi>ordinary Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi>
were excluded from it. All that
can be pretended to this purpoſe is, that
the <hi>Exhortation</hi> with the <hi>Communion
Office</hi> was then generally in the preſence
of the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and that in his preſence it
was not uſual for <hi>Presbyters</hi> to preach;
(for this is the onely thing that was
thought ſo ſtrange in preaching of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi>
before <hi>Theophilus,</hi> and S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
before <hi>Valerius,</hi> that it was done in the
preſence of their <hi>Biſhops</hi>) and that the
power of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Aſſemblies,</hi> upon
what pretence ſoever, <hi>preaching</hi> as well
as other Offices was <hi>appropriated to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.</hi>
But, 1. All <hi>private viſitations and
conferences</hi> which were much better ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the exigencies of <hi>thoſe times,</hi> might
undoubtedly be performed by <hi>ſingle Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters;</hi>
and theſe being performed with
that diligence as they were then, would
in a great meaſure ſuperſede the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>publick Sermons.</hi> And, 2. Even for
thoſe <hi>publick preachings,</hi> which had no
relation to the <hi>Communion Office,</hi> where
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:56909:157"/>
that <hi>one Altar</hi> was concerned, might have
been ordinarily permitted them by the
<hi>Biſhop.</hi> And, 3. Even thoſe which were
connected with that Office, might yet
by the <hi>Biſhops leave</hi> have been permitted
in places diſtinct from the <hi>one Altar,</hi> as
well as the <hi>Communion</hi> it ſelf.</p>
            <p>YOUR inſtance of <q>St. <hi>Patrick</hi>
founding 365 <hi>Churches,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§ LIV.</note> (for I onely
take notice of the more probable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber)
and ordaining in them 365 <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi>
and under them 3000 <hi>Presbyters,</hi>
               </q>
does not methinks ſeem any thing to
your purpoſe. You ſay, <hi>Here is no more
Biſhops than Churches;</hi> I believe you
meant the contrary, that there were no
more <hi>Churches</hi> than <hi>Biſhops,</hi> for this is
onely to your deſign, of having as many
<hi>Biſhops</hi> as <hi>Churches,</hi> that is, in your no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the word, as <hi>Pariſhes.</hi> And you
know though we pretend many <hi>Pariſh
Churches</hi> may be ſubject to one <hi>Biſhop.</hi>
Yet we are far from ſaying that there
ought to be <hi>many Biſhops in one Pariſh.</hi>
But admitting there were in S. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s
time no more <hi>Churches</hi> than <hi>Biſhops,</hi> yet
how can it follow thence, that there
were no more <hi>Pariſhes,</hi> or that the word
<hi>Church</hi> in thoſe Ages uſed without any
reſtrictive Particle, muſt ſignifie that
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:56909:157"/>
onely which were equivalent to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<hi>Pariſhes?</hi> For you know that we
do not pretend, that there ought to be
any more liberty for a <hi>Biſhop</hi> to hold <hi>plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of Dioceſes,</hi> than for a <hi>Miniſter</hi> to
have <hi>plurality of Pariſhes,</hi> though I will
not defend all <hi>practices</hi> in both particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars;
ſo that if the word <hi>Church</hi> imply
that which is <hi>Dioceſan,</hi> as moſt probably
it did according to the ſenſe of thoſe
times, then we do not think there ought
to be more <hi>Churches</hi> than <hi>Biſhops.</hi> Indeed
I confeſs the <hi>Dioceſes</hi> of thoſe times muſt
have been for ſcope of Land, as much leſs
as the number 365 is greater than 21, or
thereabouts, which is our number now.
But it is withall moſt clear, 1. That as
ſmall as they were, they were yet great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than <hi>Pariſhes,</hi> there being about nine
<hi>Presbyters</hi> to a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> as your ſelf obſerve.
For your own notion of a <hi>Pariſh</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no more than are capable of being
governed by a <hi>ſingle perſon,</hi> where nine
perſons were thought neceſſary, there
muſt be ſuppoſed nine times that propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that is, nine <hi>Pariſhes.</hi> And then if
you think your ſelf obliged to abſtain
from that <hi>Communion</hi> where <hi>Diſcipline is
impoſſible,</hi> and think it <hi>impoſſible</hi> where
the <hi>Biſhop</hi> undertakes the government of
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:56909:158"/>
any more than he is able to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of by his own <hi>perſonal care;</hi> you
muſt have conceived your ſelf obliged as
much to ſeparate from Dioceſan Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<hi>quà Dioceſan</hi> then as now, and
therefore ſhould not plead thoſe <hi>Dioceſes
as precedents.</hi> But, 2. Your own <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
will warrant the <hi>enlargment of your
Dioceſes</hi> now; for if <hi>Biſhops</hi> might in
the primitive times take the charge of
<hi>whole Cities,</hi> not becauſe the <hi>Cities</hi> were
ſmall, or the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> few, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they who owned <hi>Epiſcopal Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
that is, <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> were ſo; then I
may ſay our preſent <hi>Dioceſes</hi> may be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much <hi>inlarged</hi> ſince the <hi>diviſions of
Chriſtians.</hi> For whereas then they were
all <hi>unanimous,</hi> the caſe is otherwiſe how,
when <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> and other <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi>
being deduced of all <hi>Sects
and Opinions,</hi> thoſe onely are accounted
that own our preſent <hi>Epiſcopal Authority,</hi>
would be ſo few comparatively, ſo that
you ſee that by Separation upon account
of the too great extent of our <hi>Dioceſes,</hi>
the inconvenience is not remedied, but
confirmed in conſequence of your own
Principles. But, 3. What <hi>inconvenience</hi>
ſoever may indeed be in things of this
nature, is to be <hi>judged</hi> as well as <hi>reformed</hi>
               <pb n="299" facs="tcp:56909:158"/>
by the <hi>Governours,</hi> (whoſe proper care
it is) not to be remedied by <hi>worſe,</hi> ſuch
as are the <hi>undutifulneſs and ſeparations</hi> of
private perſons from their Superiours on
that account.</p>
            <p>I CONFIRMED this by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from <hi>experience,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§ LV.</note> from an inſtance
of <hi>Rome</hi> which though ſo great in <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi>
his time, as to need the Services
of above 1000 <hi>Clergie,</hi> was yet at the
ſame time under the <hi>Government of one
onely Biſhop.</hi> To this you anſwer,
1. That this was above 250 years after
<hi>Chriſts</hi> Birth. But this is not the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
how <hi>ſoon</hi> it was, but whether it
was not when <hi>diſcipline</hi> was ſeverely
enough obſerved? For from hence it
follows, that <hi>experience</hi> has then ſhewn,
that <hi>diſcipline</hi> was ſufficiently reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
with a <hi>Dioceſan Government,</hi> and
therefore may be ſo now if <hi>Governours</hi>
would be equally <hi>induſtrious.</hi> And that
<hi>diſcipline</hi> was then obſerved, I believe
you will not deny. You anſwer, 2. That
<q>you never took all the <hi>impotent perſons,
poor,</hi> and <hi>widows,</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> to be
<hi>Clergie-men</hi> and <hi>Clergie-women.</hi>
               </q> I ſhall
not diſpute the propriety of my <hi>expreſſion,</hi>
(not but that I know that the word has
indeed been uſed in a very large ſenſe, ſo
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:56909:159"/>
as to comprehend moſt perſons relating
to the <hi>Church,</hi> and poſſibly all there enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated)
both becauſe I do not conceive
the thing material to my preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
which is onely to ſhew the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſs
of the <hi>Church</hi> from the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> whom you will not
deny to be properly <hi>Clergie-men;</hi> and
becauſe I confeſs I too much truſted my
<hi>memory</hi> in quoting the place, and upon
conſulting the place find my ſelf to have
been miſtaken in two things: 1. That I
thought the word <hi>Clergie</hi> to have been
uſed by <hi>Cornelius.</hi> 2. That I thought
that all the ſeveral ſorts there mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Presbyters, Deacons, &amp;c.</hi> to have been
comprized in the number 1500, whereas
I now find, that the later ſort of the poor
maintained on the charges of the <hi>Church</hi>
were onely therein included. Omitting
therefore theſe miſtakes, which now I
know I will not undertake to juſtifie, the
thing I inſiſt on is, that here are 46
<hi>Presbyters</hi> mentioned, and that there
were in <hi>Rome quadraginta,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Optat. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lev. l. 11. cont. Parm.</note> 
               <hi>&amp; quod ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currit,
Baſilicae,</hi> (as we learn from <hi>Opta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>)
when <hi>Victor Garbienſis</hi> was ſent from
<hi>Africa</hi> to be made the <hi>Schiſmatical Biſhop
of Rome,</hi> which was about the <hi>perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Diocleſian,</hi> when the Schiſm of the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:56909:159"/>
               <hi>Donatiſts</hi> commenced. Which number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<hi>Baſilicae</hi> or <hi>Pariſh Churches</hi> (for you
have already ſeemed to grant, that <hi>Rome</hi>
was then divided into <hi>Pariſhes</hi>) may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well agree with the number of <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi>
mentioned by <hi>Cornelius.</hi> There
being therefore even then ſo many <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
in Rome,</hi> as were able to make up
46 <hi>Pariſhes,</hi> beſides thoſe of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or
<hi>Region</hi> adjacent ſubject, according to
the practice of thoſe times, to the <hi>Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi>
of the <hi>City Biſhop;</hi> it is plain
that the <hi>Dioceſe</hi> was even then of a larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
extent than <hi>Parochial,</hi> as your ſelf had
already granted, (though here you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to <hi>anſwer the arguments,</hi> that are
deſigned to prove no more than what
you had granted;) and therefore 46
times exceeding the ability of a <hi>ſingle
perſon.</hi> Yet I believe you will not deny,
but that all this number was then ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
governed by <hi>one Biſhop,</hi> without
any viſible decay of <hi>diſcipline</hi> obſervable
in thoſe times. I know indeed that
Mr. <hi>Potter</hi> in order to his own deſign
does endeavour to prove the number of
<hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Titles</hi> originally derived
from <hi>Cletus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Interp. of the number 666, c. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Euariſtus, Dionyſius,</hi> and
<hi>Marcellus</hi> to have been 25. Nor ſhall I
now digreſs to ſhew the ground of his
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:56909:160"/>
miſtake. All that I ſhall deſire you to
obſerve at preſent is, that his Authors
are either evidently <hi>late,</hi> or ſuſpicious if
pretendedly <hi>ancient;</hi> not comparable in
<hi>credibility</hi> to <hi>Cornelius</hi> and <hi>Optatus</hi> produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by me. But if I ſhould admit all
that he pretends, yet 25 <hi>Pariſhes</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
are too large an extent for ſuch
<hi>Dioceſes,</hi> as you deſire, that might not
exceed the perſonal abilities of <hi>one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT you endeavour to give ſome
account how their <hi>Clergie</hi> might be <hi>nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous</hi>
though their people were <hi>few,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§ LVI.</note>
from the conceived extraordinary exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies
of thoſe times. But neither does
it appear that the exigencies were indeed
ſo <hi>extraordinary,</hi> there appearing no
ground to believe any <hi>Innovation</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated
to preſent exigencies; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that that had been the <hi>ordinary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment:</hi>
if it had, were it to your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
For the ſame <hi>extraordinary exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi>
which then required the united
helps of a <hi>multitude of Clergie,</hi> made the
burthen too great for <hi>one;</hi> and therefore
if a <hi>Biſhop</hi> cannot (as by your Principles
he cannot) undertake the <hi>government</hi> of
a number too great for his <hi>perſonal care,</hi>
without prejudice of <hi>diſcipline;</hi> it will
follow that he could not do it then. But
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:56909:160"/>
it appearing clearly otherwiſe, namely
that <hi>diſcipline</hi> was ſeverely maintained
under a <hi>Government properly Dioceſan,</hi>
that is including a <hi>multitude of ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
cures;</hi> it is plain, that what neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects
are now in that kind, are not to be

            </p>
            <p>BUT I ſhall conſider the <hi>diſparities</hi>
themſelves:<note place="margin">§ LVII.</note> 1.<q> The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
were then obſcure and ſmall in
houſes, (as the <hi>tolerated Churches in
London.</hi>)</q> But I have already ſhewn
you how the <hi>multitudes of Chriſtians</hi> were
(according to the practiſes of thoſe Ages)
ſuppliable without any unneceſſary mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication
of <hi>Altars,</hi> or <hi>Prieſts,</hi> or <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;</hi>
and that this <hi>multitude of Prieſts</hi>
was not accommodated to their extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
meetings in houſes occaſionally,
but their ſolemn appointed places for
<hi>Parochial Aſſemblies,</hi> for ſuch were the
<hi>Tituli</hi> or <hi>Baſilicae.</hi> You conſider, 2. <q>That
theſe meetings were in ſo vaſt a <hi>City</hi> in
ſo many <hi>diſtinct places.</hi>
               </q> But the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>
of thoſe times were not ſo ſparing
of their pains, as to ſcruple the diſtances
of places in the <hi>greateſt Cities,</hi> for the
comfort of their <hi>Synaxes;</hi> for in S. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin
Martyr</hi>'s time they came out of the

               <hi>Country</hi> to the <hi>City-meetings,</hi> much more
from the moſt diſtant places of the ſame
<hi>City.</hi> And therefore it is not probable
that the diſtance of place, but the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of the perſons, occaſioned the
<hi>multiplication of the Clergie.</hi> And by the
multitude of their poor, 1500 not onely
1050 as you miſtake) you may gueſs at
their multitudes. For it was too great a
proportion for the multitudes of <hi>one Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,</hi>
eſpecially where S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Rule was
ſeverely obſerved, that none ſhould be
maintained on the <hi>Churches account,</hi> but
ſuch as were <hi>poor indeed,</hi> and where none
ſhould <hi>eat</hi> who did not <hi>labour</hi> if he were
able. Beſides, the <hi>treaſures of that Church</hi>
were thought worthy the deſign of the

               <note place="margin">Prudent. Periſt. in Laurent.</note> You conſider,

you mean the Aſſemblies in the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs

not doubt but that they contained a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
too great for a <hi>ſingle Parish</hi>) and then
the former Anſwer will ſuffice, that they
who ordinarily came out of the <hi>Country</hi>
to the <hi>City Aſſemblies,</hi> were not likely to
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:56909:161"/>
ſcruple coming to them from the <hi>Suburbs,</hi>
if their numbers might be entertained in

many <hi>Presbyters</hi> uſed ſtill to be with the
<hi>Biſhop</hi> in the ſame <hi>Aſſembly.</hi> If you mean
it on ſolemn occaſions of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the <hi>Government of the Church,</hi> I
confeſs it; but you cannot thence infer,
that they being deducted few would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
for <hi>Parochial Cures,</hi> being thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but rare, they might all be ſpared
from their Parochial Affairs. But if you
think, that in all ordinary <hi>Synaxes</hi> ſuch
a number of them were <hi>obliged</hi> to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
attendance on him, as muſt diſtract
them from their other Imployments; I
believe you have no ground to think ſo.
In the Form of their <hi>Offices</hi> by S. <hi>Juſtin

here were in all but <hi>ſeven Deacons.</hi> But
this is no argument to conclude the <hi>pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city

taken up in that Age, from that <hi>unſecure

any more than <hi>ſeven,</hi> becauſe there were

And that

the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Conc. Neo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caeſar.</note> but upon ſome ſuch

conjectured becauſe we find it obſerved
in S. <hi>Laurence</hi> his time, who being <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon

               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by
<hi>Prudentius.</hi> And you will accordingly
find conſtantly in the Author of the <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical,</hi>
the number of <hi>Deacons</hi> ordained
by every <hi>Biſhop of Rome</hi> to be leſs than
of <hi>Presbyters;</hi> and this comparative <hi>pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city

was accounted by S. <hi>Hierom</hi> an occaſion
of the <hi>Deacons</hi> preſumption, in his <hi>Epiſt.

appearing</hi> in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> be taken
from the <hi>Biſhops</hi> ſitting in the <hi>Church</hi>
(as if I be not miſtaken the moſt <hi>learned
and judicious</hi> Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> thinks it is)
then as the 24 <hi>Elders</hi> may allude to the
<hi>Chriſtian Presbyteries,</hi> derived from the
<hi>leſſer Sanhedrims</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> conſiſting
of 24;<note place="margin">Vid. Orig. tract. 24. in Matth.</note> ſo the <hi>ſeven miniſtring Spirits</hi> may

<pb n="307" facs="tcp:56909:162"/>
Angels,</hi> ſo famous among the <hi>Jews,</hi> (as
Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> proves profeſſedly) which are
called <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> by the Apoſtle,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 1. allude to the <hi>ſeptenary number of

his commands, as the <hi>Angels</hi> are ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by the <hi>Jews</hi> to do on <hi>God himſelf.</hi>
Nor need you wonder that ſo ſmall a
<hi>number of Deacons</hi> might be conceived
ſufficient to anſwer ſo great a <hi>proportion
of Presbyters,</hi> conſidering that their ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Office was to diſtribute the <hi>Alms of the

attendance on the Biſhop,</hi> as ſmall a
number as <hi>ſeven</hi> might be ſufficient in a
great <hi>City.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. You ſay,<note place="margin">§ LVIII</note> 
               <q>That many then were
<hi>Presbyters</hi> that uſed not to <hi>preach,</hi> but
for privater overſight, and as the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops

               </q> This, though for my
part I conceive it very true, ſeems ſtrange
to me to proceed from a perſon of <hi>your
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:56909:163"/>
principles,</hi> who uſually teach <hi>publick prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching

indiſpenſible duty of every particular
<hi>Goſpel Miniſter,</hi> by which name they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
if they do not onely mean, <hi>Prieſts.</hi>
But ſuppoſing it true as I believe it was,
that there were <hi>ſeveral Prieſts</hi> who did
not <hi>preach;</hi> yet will not this diminiſh
the multitude of <hi>Pariſhes,</hi> as you ſeem to
conceive. For I believe you cannot prove

an ordinary <hi>parochial imployment.</hi> And
though it were not, yet there were others
equivalent ſufficient to take up the time

communicating, exhorting, perſuading, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving

for diſcerning who were <hi>fit or unfit</hi>
for their <hi>communion;</hi> all thoſe Offices
which were performed out of their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

there might have been as many <hi>Parochial

               </q>
If your meaning herein be to conclude,
that the 1500 <hi>poor</hi> were the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
part of <hi>Believers,</hi> that you might
conclude the whole number of <hi>Converts</hi>
to have been ſmall; you ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered
what <hi>poor</hi> they were, ſuch as
were maintained on the <hi>publick charity,</hi>
that is, ſuch as were not onely <hi>poor</hi> but
<hi>impotent,</hi> unable to get their livings
otherwiſe. And ſure you cannot but
think, that the multitude of other Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
upon whoſe <hi>charity</hi> they were main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
eſpecially if <hi>poor</hi> themſelves,
(though able to earn a livelyhood) as
you ſeem to ſuppoſe, muſt have been
great, eſpecially conſidering the other
expenſes of their <hi>charity</hi> on the <hi>Clergie,</hi>
on the <hi>Martyrs and Confeſſors,</hi> on their
<hi>hoſpitality to ſtrangers, &amp;c.</hi> all which may
be ſufficient preſumptions that theſe
1500 <hi>poor</hi> did not in any probability bear
any conſiderable proportion to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> by whom
they were maintained. And I believe in
few <hi>Cities</hi> in our Kings Dominions, if
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:56909:164"/>
any, will be found ſo great a number of
<hi>poor,</hi> who by reaſon of <hi>impotency</hi> are
thought by the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> fit objects of
the <hi>publick charity,</hi> even in theſe our
Ages, wherein all are ſuppoſed <hi>Profeſſors
of Chriſtianity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. You ſay,<note place="margin">§ LX.</note> 
               <q>That none of theſe but
the 46 <hi>Presbyters</hi> had any power in the
<hi>diſcipline.</hi>
               </q> If you mean a <hi>decretory pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
in the ſenſe I have explained it, then I
think I have proved that the 45 <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
themſelves had it not, but the <hi>Biſhop</hi>
alone. But you can thence no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the <hi>paucity of Believers</hi> in one of
the <hi>Dioceſes</hi> of thoſe times, than in any
one of ours now, when it is plain that
the <hi>Biſhop</hi> himſelf has <hi>monopolized</hi> it, as
your ſelf complain. But if you mean
an <hi>executive</hi> or even a <hi>conſultory power</hi> of
giving conſent or advice in affairs of <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline,</hi>
to be decreed by the <hi>Biſhop;</hi> that
was ſo far from being <hi>confined</hi> to the
<hi>Presbyters,</hi> as that it was communicated
to the <hi>Deacons,</hi> nay to the <hi>common people</hi>
themſelves. This might eaſily have been
cleared from <hi>Cornelius</hi> his Contemporary
S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> (from whom we have the
cleareſt account of the <hi>diſcipline</hi> of that
Age) if I had not been unwilling to be
more tedeous than needs I muſt; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:56909:164"/>
upon reflection I believe your ſelf
will acknowledge it, and becauſe it is
uſually undertaken by <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> but
eſpecially <hi>Independent,</hi> Authors. Indeed
there were ſome privileges of the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
that they onely ſate in the <hi>Biſhops
preſence,</hi> as S. <hi>Hierom</hi> tells us, beſides
other diſtinctions in <hi>Synaxes.</hi> But it is
ſufficient for my purpoſe that the <hi>execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of diſcipline,</hi> which is the main thing
which neceſſarily requires <hi>plurality,</hi> was
managed by all; and that for <hi>counſel</hi> here
was a number exceeding the Councils of
ſeveral Princes of Dominions larger than
any <hi>Dioceſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But,<note place="margin">§ LXI.</note> 9. You ſay, <q>That by all this
reckoning the <hi>whole Church</hi> maintained
not (beſides the <hi>Officers</hi>) near 1000 <hi>poor,</hi>
we may probably conjecture that the
<hi>whole Church</hi> of that <hi>Biſh.</hi> was not bigger
than ſome one <hi>London Pariſh, (Stepney,
S. Giles Cripplegate</hi>) where are about
50000 Souls.</q> But, 1. You are miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in your account: For, 1. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the <hi>poor</hi> beſides the <hi>Officers</hi> were
not near 1000 onely, but 1500; for the
<hi>Officers</hi> are not included in that number,
as you ſuppoſe. 2. That number of <hi>poor</hi>
maintained on the <hi>publick charity,</hi> does
imply a greater number than you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:56909:165"/>
For conſider, 1. That no <hi>poor</hi> were
reckoned in that number, but ſuch as
were unable to <hi>earn a livelyhood</hi> for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
according to S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Rule alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
mentioned. Conſider, 2. That even
of thoſe <hi>impotent poor</hi> none were to be
charged on the <hi>Church</hi> that had believing
Friends able to maintain them, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to another Rule of the ſame S. <hi>Paul,
1 Tim.</hi> 5. 4, 8. by which means none were
likely to have been maintained by the
<hi>Church,</hi> but ſuch as might have been
<hi>ſtarved</hi> if they had not been ſo relieved.
Now conſidering that, according to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Graunts</hi> Calculation of 229250 in
<hi>London,</hi> not above 51 were ſtarved,
which he reckons as the 4000th. part,
but with too great latitude, for it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the 4495th. part, beſides a Fracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of 5, or thereabouts, if his Numbers
be rightly printed; let 1500 be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
by 4495, and the ſumm will be
6742500; or if it be multiplied by his
own proportion of 4000, it will amount
to 6000000, a ſumm too great for the
<hi>City.</hi> And by all deductions that may
be made, for the unkindneſs of ſome
<hi>Chriſtian Friends,</hi> and of moſt <hi>Heathen,</hi>
that would leave many deſtitute of their
help, for no other reaſon than their being
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:56909:165"/>
               <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and of others that were main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by the <hi>Church,</hi> not for want of
<hi>callings,</hi> but of <hi>lawful ones,</hi> as the <hi>Stage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>player</hi>
in S. <hi>Cyprian;</hi> and the <hi>remiſneſs of
ſome Officers</hi> of thoſe many entruſted in
this affair, who either might have not
uſed their utmoſt diligence in <hi>informing</hi>
themſelves of the poverty and helpleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the perſons admitted by them, or
might have failed of the ſucceſs, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
miſinformed after all humane dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
and have had perſons ſufficient
either in themſelves, or by help of their
Friends, obtruded on them; or all other
failings imaginable, (for I confeſs <hi>moral
affairs</hi> are not to be eſtimated by <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
meaſures;</hi>) yet it will be hard af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all to bring the ſumm ſo low as
460000, which Captain <hi>Graunt</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
to be the whole number of Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
in <hi>London,</hi> much more to reduce
it to the limits of the greateſt <hi>Pariſh</hi>
mentioned by you. But, 2. If you had
indeed computed right, and the number
had been no greater than of one of thoſe
<hi>great Pariſhes</hi> you ſpeak of; yet why
ſhould not the numbers of people here
mentioned be thought ſufficient for a
<hi>Dioceſe</hi> even in our modern ſenſe? For
I doubt there are no <hi>Cities in the Kings
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:56909:166"/>
Dominions</hi> that have <hi>Epiſcopal Sees,</hi> that
have 50000 Inhabitants, except <hi>London.</hi>
Ours of <hi>Dublin,</hi> which is thought by
moſt that have ſeen it, to be ſecond to
<hi>London</hi> for <hi>greatneſs and populouſneſs,</hi> is by
a <hi>Bill of Mortality,</hi> and an account of the
<hi>Poll-money</hi> ſent to Captain <hi>Graunt,</hi> eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
to contain onely 30000, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,
(though I can hardly believe that
to be our full number;) according to
which eſtimation the <hi>Pariſhes</hi> you ſpeak
of will exceed us by two thirds more;
and ſo I believe they will equal our <hi>whole
Dioceſe;</hi> for I believe the reſt of it put
together can hardly exceed the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of two third parts to the <hi>City.</hi> And
can you think the ſame number in a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh</hi>
governable by the <hi>ſingle unaſſiſted abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities</hi>
of a ſingle <hi>Pariſh Miniſter,</hi> and not
think it ſo by a <hi>Biſhop</hi> ſeconded by his
<hi>Presbytery, Dignitaries,</hi> and <hi>Parochial Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates.</hi>
Or, if the caſe of preſerving <hi>diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi>
be harder in ſuch a <hi>Pariſh</hi> than ſuch
a <hi>Dioceſe,</hi> (as certainly upon the accounts
now mentioned it needs muſt be;) then
I pray conſider what <hi>equality</hi> is it to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with our <hi>Pariſhes</hi> indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately,
(ſuch great ones themſelves not
being excepted;) and yet to ſeparate as
indiſcriminately from our <hi>Dioceſan Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi>
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:56909:166"/>
even of ſuch as exceed not thoſe
<hi>greater Pariſhes</hi> in the numbers of their
<hi>people,</hi> though they do in numbers of
their <hi>Governours.</hi> And if you think that
as many may meet in <hi>one place,</hi> as may
make up our ordinary preſent <hi>Dioceſes,</hi>
(as you muſt do if they may be conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
included in a <hi>Pariſh;</hi>) then how
can you conclude the leſs populouſneſs of
the <hi>ancient</hi> than our <hi>modern Dioceſes,</hi> from
that very Topick of their meeting in <hi>one
place?</hi> For my part I verily believe that
it is by accident, not deſignedly, that
thoſe <hi>Pariſhes</hi> have ſo vaſtly exceeded
their ordinary proportion, merely from
the encreaſe of the <hi>trade of the City</hi> in
thoſe parts, which were more thinly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
when the <hi>Pariſhes</hi> were firſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed,
as you may eaſily conjecture
from the diſproportion, ſome of them
exceeding other <hi>Pariſhes</hi> in your <hi>City</hi> an
hundredfold, as is obſerved by Captain
<hi>Graunt,</hi> which is more than there are
<hi>Pariſhes</hi> in ſome of our <hi>Dioceſes;</hi> and
from the diſproportion of their <hi>ancient
Churches,</hi> when they were deſigned <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes,</hi>
with their <hi>preſent multitudes,</hi> and
their <hi>equality</hi> with thoſe other <hi>Pariſh
Churches,</hi> whoſe <hi>preſent Pariſhioners</hi> are
ſo extremely unequal, and that theſe <hi>vaſt
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:56909:167"/>
Pariſhes</hi> are generally in the <hi>Suburbs,</hi>
where the <hi>City</hi> was very likely to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.
And therefore ſeeing the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
of thoſe <hi>Pariſhes</hi> ſeem never yet to
have been <hi>approved,</hi> though they were
not yet amended; you cannot thence
conjecture, what has certainly appeared
<hi>falſe</hi> as to matter of fact, that the <hi>Roman

though <hi>Dioceſan Churches</hi> might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed

that it may be ſo now. But I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

be proportioned onely to the <hi>good humours</hi>

reform thoſe lapſes to which men <hi>eaſily

and naturally</hi> degenerate, and therefore
that there muſt have been the <hi>ſame power
in Governours</hi> then as now, though there
was not the ſame neceſſity of its <hi>actual
exerciſe.</hi> And that the <hi>Biſhops power</hi> was
not onely over <hi>orderly Converts,</hi> but over

<hi>diſcipline</hi> of their <hi>Church,</hi> when their
lapſes were countenanced, than now
when they are diſcouraged by the <hi>Civil

were to be <hi>converted</hi> and ſeverely <hi>diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined</hi>
for the trial of their <hi>veracity,</hi> and
ſecuring them from a <hi>relapſe.</hi> And if

to;</hi> certainly the difficulty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
<hi>Heathens</hi> muſt have been much

            </p>
            <p>
               <q>BUT when all is done (you ſay)
<hi>two Cities</hi> under the power of great

               </q> So that it ſeems
you are at laſt diffident of your Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

what you pretend were true, that they

and I believe you cannot give an inſtance
of a <hi>Parochial Church</hi> in the ſenſe we now

it; for I have already ſhewn <hi>that Church</hi>
to be the Church of a <hi>whole City</hi> how
great ſoever, and therefore to have been
<hi>Dioceſan</hi> not <hi>Parochial.</hi> And for the
Argument from <hi>Experience,</hi> though it
will hold well enough as I have managed
it, that <hi>diſcipline</hi> has once been preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
under a <hi>Dioceſan Government,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it may be ſo again; yet not <hi>vice ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſâ</hi>

            <p>MY inſtance of <q>

when <hi>Eudoxius</hi> prevailed with <hi>Ulphilas</hi>

(an expreſſion certainly as <hi>comprehenſive</hi>

his Authority is deſcribed to have been

<hi>Chriſtian,</hi> which could not have

by <hi>Athanaricus.</hi> But you ſay, That
<hi>Ulphilas</hi> was an <hi>Arian.</hi> But, 1. If he
had been ſo, yet that cannot weaken his
Authority in our preſent caſe, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this practice of a <hi>Nations</hi> having
but <hi>one Biſhop,</hi> is never reckoned by the
<hi>Haereſiographers</hi> as a point of <hi>Arianiſm,</hi> no
nor as a <hi>ſingularity</hi> of the <hi>Arians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
upon perſonal accounts. Nay,
my other inſtances of <hi>Tiramentus</hi> and
<hi>Moſes</hi> were both <hi>Catholicks;</hi> nay, the
<hi>Goths</hi> themſelves whileſt <hi>Catholicks</hi> had
the ſame <hi>form of Government</hi> that is, till
<hi>Ulphilas</hi> was wrought on by <hi>Eudoxius.</hi>
Till that time not onely his Predeceſſor
<hi>Theophilus,</hi> but <hi>himſelf</hi> maintained the
<hi>Nicene Faith</hi> in oppoſition to the <hi>Arian
Communion,</hi> and yet in all likelyhood
they were not much leſs numerous when
<hi>Catholicks</hi> than when <hi>Arians;</hi> for the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:56909:170"/>
               <hi>whole Nation</hi> which is ſaid by him to
have been reconciled to the <hi>Arian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi>
were in all likelyhood none but
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and therefore <hi>Catholicks,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they ſeem at that time to have been
<hi>unanimous.</hi> But, 2. It does not appear
that he was a <hi>real Arian.</hi> I confeſs he
did communicate with the <hi>Arians,</hi> and
that not onely with the more moderate
<hi>Homouſians,</hi> but alſo with thoſe who
owned <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be a <hi>creature,</hi> and by
degrees from communicating with the
<hi>Arians</hi> the <hi>Goths</hi> afterwards uſed the

as appears in their <hi>later perſecutions</hi> of
the <hi>Catholicks</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Africa.</hi> But
at firſt the very reaſon that prevailed

it, that is, <hi>skill</hi> in the <hi>Canon Laws</hi> and
<hi>prudence in Government;</hi> ſo that their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alſo <hi>ordained perſons</hi> would onely
prove an advantage of <hi>decorum,</hi> not of
<hi>material influence on Government.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
unleſs <hi>Clergiemen</hi> were better <hi>skilled</hi>
               <pb n="328" facs="tcp:56909:173"/>
in theſe things, than I doubt they are
commonly, their onely being <hi>Clergiemen</hi>
would not ſo conveniently fit them for
ſervice in this kind, if wanting thoſe
other more <hi>eſſential qualifications,</hi> as their
having them though wanting <hi>Orders.</hi>
So that of the two evils which follow
their diſunion in the ſame perſons this
ſeems to be the <hi>leſs.</hi> But if you think no
<hi>aſſiſtance</hi> ſufficient, but ſuch as may
make them <hi>independent</hi> on their <hi>Biſhop,</hi>
that I have proved as far from the <hi>practice</hi>
of thoſe <hi>earlier ages</hi> as of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>2. YOU ſay,<note place="margin">§ LXVII.</note> 
               <q>It's ſtrange that we
that have <hi>eyes and ears</hi> muſt be ſent to
the <hi>Perſians</hi> (you mean the <hi>Indians</hi>)
and <hi>ancient Hiſtory,</hi> to know whether
<hi>one Biſhop</hi> can hear, and try, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh
ſo many <hi>thouſands</hi> at once, as
we <hi>ſee by experience</hi> are thoſe <hi>objects of
diſcipline,</hi> which the Scripture deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth;
and when we ſee that it is not
done.</q> But all this need not have been
thought <hi>ſo ſtrange,</hi> if you had remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
the true <hi>ſtate of the queſtion;</hi> that it
was not whether <hi>diſcipline</hi> were <hi>actually</hi>
maintained by our <hi>Dioceſan Government?</hi>
but whether it <hi>could not</hi> poſſibly be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
under it? and that it does no way
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:56909:173"/>
follow that it <hi>cannot</hi> becauſe it <hi>is not.</hi>
That although this argument <hi>ab actu ad
potentiam negativè</hi> (which is yours) do
not hold, yet mine which proceeds <hi>affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matively</hi>
will, That <hi>diſcipline</hi> has actually
been maintained under a <hi>Dioceſan Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
therefore it is ſtill <hi>poſſible</hi> to be
maintained under it. That for conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
this <hi>poſſibility</hi> it is not requiſite that
it muſt be maintained <hi>in all times and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
but it is ſufficient that it was in <hi>any,</hi>
and that ſure may be proved as well by
<hi>ancient and exotick Hiſtories,</hi> as by thoſe
which are <hi>modern and of our own Country.</hi>
And for ſhewing the <hi>poſſibility,</hi> I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
proved, that ſo many <hi>thouſands</hi>
may as well be <hi>diſciplined</hi> by one <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical</hi>
as one <hi>Secular Monarch.</hi> That of
thoſe many <hi>thouſand objects of diſcipline</hi>
you conceive deſcribed in the Scripture,
many are onely Objects of <hi>private cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance,</hi>
which is not denied to ordinary
<hi>Pariſh Miniſters.</hi> That they who are of
<hi>publick</hi> are not ſo extremely <hi>numerous,</hi> or
if they were, they may be dealt with as
in <hi>Seculars,</hi> ſome puniſhed <hi>in terrorem,</hi>
and others equally guilty permitted to
eſcape without any great charge of <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality,</hi>
than what is ordinarily thought
<hi>equitable</hi> in great multitudes by <hi>ſecular
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:56909:174"/>
perſons.</hi> And that of thoſe which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,
it is not ſo requiſite that all be
tried at once, and that one muſt hinder
the procedure againſt the other. But
after all this you ſay, <q>We have talked
but of a Phantaſm; for it is not <hi>one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi>
but <hi>one Layman,</hi> a <hi>Chancellour,</hi> that
uſeth this <hi>decretory power</hi> of the Keys,
&amp;c. and that the <hi>Biſhop</hi> rarely meddleth
with it.</q> Still you forget that I did in
my former Letter expreſly decline this
Controverſie, and intimated that our
preſent queſtion was not concerning the
<hi>decorum of the perſon,</hi> but the <hi>poſſibility of
diſcipline</hi> under him; (and ſure you will
not deny that a <hi>Laymans</hi> abilities for <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
may be as great as a <hi>Clergie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
whence it will follow, that <hi>diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi>
may as well be preſerved under
him;) that our queſtion was concerning
<hi>Dioceſan Government</hi> as ſuch, that is, as
including under it the <hi>Cures of ſeveral
Presbyters,</hi> to which this office of <hi>Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chancellour</hi>
is accidental. The buſineſs of
the <hi>Covenant</hi> I am unwilling to engage
in, becauſe I do not know whether it
can be done conveniently without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
Your <hi>Explication</hi> of my <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi>
concerning the words <hi>[conſent to
the uſe, &amp;c.]</hi> in the <hi>Act for Uniformity,</hi> I
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:56909:174"/>
verily believe to be <hi>true,</hi> both becauſe
you ſay it, and becauſe it doth not deny,
but onely give a further account of ſome
paſſages not mentioned by my worthy
<hi>Author;</hi> and becauſe the word <hi>[uſe]</hi>
is omitted in the <hi>Form</hi> it ſelf, though
mentioned immediately before. What
the Reaſons were that were urged
by the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> for proving
them <hi>intolerable</hi> I know not, nor have
been informed by you; yet I could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
ſeveral that were very appoſite
and expedient, notwithſtanding they
might not intend to oblige to an <hi>internal
aſſent,</hi> in caſe <hi>exteriour peaceable acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcency,</hi>
as it is uſually underſtood by
<hi>Conformiſts</hi> themſelves; and that they
did not intend to exclude <hi>peaceable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts,</hi>
though otherwiſe not ſatisfied
of the <hi>expedience</hi> of every <hi>ſingle Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
ſeems very credible, becauſe there is
not the leaſt intimation of ſo rigid an
expoſition as that is which is mentioned
by you, <hi>That you muſt never endeavour any
alteration, no not by a requeſt or word.</hi> All
that is deſired is, that you would not,
while you are a private perſon, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
any further than by <hi>requeſt and
words;</hi> (as indeed you cannot lawfully
and juſtly do without encroaching on the
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:56909:175"/>
offices of others, which cannot be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by the conceived juſtice of your
cauſe.) That you would give leave,
when all is done, to the <hi>perſons requeſted</hi>
by you to judge of the <hi>reaſonableneſs</hi> of
your <hi>requeſts,</hi> not obliging them to act
by <hi>yours</hi> but their <hi>own conſciences,</hi> which
when all is done muſt be the meaſure of
their own proceedings. That in caſe of
their diſſent from you, you neither <hi>raiſe
parties</hi> againſt them, nor <hi>encourage</hi> them
that do by communicating with them.
That you would in ſuch a caſe not eaſily
conclude the error to be in your <hi>Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,</hi>
conſidering that your <hi>ſelf</hi> are at
leaſt as <hi>fallible</hi> as they; or if you did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
think the cauſe ſo <hi>evident,</hi> as might
juſtly warrant your diſſent, (as I confeſs
thet there are ſome degrees of <hi>evidence</hi>
to private perſons ſufficient to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
any <hi>authority</hi> whatſoever) yet that
you would uſe no <hi>other means</hi> for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
againſt the conceived prejudices
of <hi>Governours,</hi> than ſuch as would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the modeſty of a <hi>private perſon,</hi>
powerful <hi>perſuaſions</hi> and hearty <hi>prayers.</hi>
That even in ſuch caſes they would give
<hi>active obedience</hi> in things <hi>not ſinful,</hi> and
<hi>paſſive</hi> in ſuch as were. This behaviour
would ſalve the difficulties on both ſides,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:56909:175"/>
would both preſerve the <hi>peace of the
Church,</hi> and the <hi>peace of a Diſſenters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi>
if invincibly perſuaded; would
miniſter more comfort to him, and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
him of his own ſincerity in deſigning
the <hi>glory of God,</hi> when there were leſs
ſuſpicions of any ends of his <hi>own;</hi> and
his <hi>ſufferings</hi> for the <hi>peace of the Church</hi>
would be as glorious and rewardable, if
we may believe S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> as if they
were for the <hi>faith of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF I had been dealing with a perſon
leſs zealous and induſtrious for this <hi>peace</hi>
than you have approved your ſelf by
publick Monuments,<note place="margin">§ LXVIII</note> it had here been
ſeaſonable to have conjured you by all
that is or can be dear to a <hi>Lover of God,</hi>
or of the <hi>honour of Religion;</hi> by all your
<hi>ſacred</hi> or <hi>civil Intereſts,</hi> by your reſpects
either to the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Country</hi> of your
birth and education, which are not more
prejudiced by any thing than our <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical

to lay out thoſe great Talents of <hi>Parts</hi>
and <hi>Intereſt in the Peoples Affections,</hi>
wherewith God has ſo abundantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched
you, on the <hi>reconciliation of the

would conſider it as your greateſt ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
to be <hi>inquiſitor and wary</hi> in a cauſe
of ſo dangerous conſequence, if you
ſhould prove miſtaken, and your greateſt

any opinions,</hi> how <hi>long</hi> maintained, or how
<hi>dear</hi> ſoever, when they ſhall appear to be
<hi>erroneous.</hi> That you would be pleaſed in

not as an <hi>adverſary</hi> to my <hi>cauſe;</hi>
but as a diligent <hi>enquirer after truth,</hi>
where ever it may be found, as our moſt

you would excuſe my failings in the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety
of words,</hi> and correct thoſe that
may be found in the <hi>diſadvantage of my
management,</hi> and conſider all not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the <hi>nature, ſtrength, and evidence of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments

to your own ſatisfaction, by your

would beware of precipitancy in <hi>reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi>
               <pb n="335" facs="tcp:56909:176"/>
and of tenaciouſneſs in <hi>maintaining</hi>

ſufficient to have <hi>intimated them,</hi> rather as

I ſhall therefore recommend the

            <head>Poſtſcript.</head>
            <p>SInce my Letter to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> which
gave him warning of my deſign to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
<hi>theſe,</hi> he has haſtened out an
<hi>old</hi> Diſcourſe written before my <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
which he will needs have paſs for an
<hi>Anſwer to my Letters,</hi> which were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
afterwards. He cannot pretend it to
make any <hi>Application</hi> to moſt of the <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars</hi>
of mine: all therefore that he can
truly ſo much as pretend, is onely that it is
<hi>virtually an Anſwer,</hi> by diſproving my <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers</hi>
by ſuch <hi>principles</hi> as are <hi>unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi>
by any <hi>principles</hi> laid down by mine, or
by a further proof of his <hi>own</hi> aſſertions. But
he is the perſon who accepts not of ſuch <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Anſwers</hi> from his Adverſary. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
why is he ſtill ſo clamorous for Anſwers
to <hi>Voetius</hi> and his own <hi>Diſputations of
Church-government?</hi> For what is there
in either of them (as far as I am concerned,
who am not concerned for any of the peculiar
ways, by which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> manage this
ſame Argument, not now to mention the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other particulars, which peculiarly relate
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:56909:181"/>
to the ſingular ways of ſtating the ſame Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions,
in other <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> or even <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal,</hi>
Authors, which are notwithſtanding nor
made uſe of by me) but what has already been
ſufficiently provided for by the <hi>principles</hi> of
my <hi>former Diſcourſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I will not deal ſo hardly with <hi>him</hi> as
he does with <hi>me.</hi> I accept even of <hi>virtual
Anſwers</hi> where I can find them. What has
he therefore ſaid to the Subjects of the two
Particulars which himſelf mentions as the
ſumme of my Letters? Has he produced
any thing <hi>new,</hi> to ſhew that his Arguments
to prove the <hi>impoſſibility of Eccleſiaſtical
Diſcipline,</hi> in a <hi>Dioceſe</hi> conſiſting of a
<hi>number of Presbyters</hi> proportionable to the
<hi>populouſneſs</hi> of the <hi>Dioceſe,</hi> but obnoxious
to the <hi>curb and Eccleſiaſtical coercion</hi> of
the <hi>Dioceſan Biſhop,</hi> do not as validly
overthrow the <hi>poſſibility</hi> of the like <hi>Secular
Diſcipline</hi> under a <hi>Monarch</hi> of a Diſtrict
equal to a <hi>Dioceſe,</hi> with the like aſſiſtance
of <hi>ſubordinate Governours?</hi> Has he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that it is more the <hi>Biſhops</hi> office to take
a <hi>perſonal</hi> care of every <hi>Soul</hi> in his <hi>Dioceſe,</hi>
than it is the <hi>Monarchs</hi> to ſecure the <hi>Lives
and Fortunes</hi> of every <hi>Subject</hi> in his <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions?</hi>
Has he offered any further proof,
that any thing in the <hi>Biſhops Office</hi> does
oblige him to diſcharge his Office to every <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual</hi>
               <pb n="346" facs="tcp:56909:182"/>
in his <hi>own perſon,</hi> more than the
like <hi>office</hi> of the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> does him to be
particularly acquainted with all the caſes of
his <hi>particular Subjects?</hi> Has he ſhewn
that it is any more a <hi>culpable delegation</hi>
of the <hi>Epiſcopal Office,</hi> to imploy <hi>others</hi>
in the care of thoſe many numbers in a <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſe,</hi>
to which no care of a <hi>ſingle perſon</hi> can
extend, than it is in a <hi>Prince</hi> that he does
not perſonally arreſt and puniſh every <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Offender?</hi> Till theſe things, or
ſomething equivalent to theſe, be urged
with <hi>greater force</hi> than they were in thoſe
<hi>Letters</hi> of his which were anſwered by mine,
and urged in ſuch a way as may prevent the
<hi>Anſwers</hi> which may be given by the <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
laid down here; I cannot in equity think
my ſelf obliged to make particular <hi>applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
to ſuch <hi>Anſwers</hi> as afford no matter for
further <hi>improvement or diſcovery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other <hi>particular</hi> inſiſted on by me
was, that in thoſe <hi>primitive times,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>diſcipline</hi> did moſt remarkably <hi>flouriſh,</hi>
the <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> was not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<hi>Dioceſan;</hi> which plainly ſhews
that <hi>diſcipline</hi> is ſtill <hi>practicable</hi> under a
<hi>Dioceſan Government.</hi> And what has he
done new for avoiding this conſequence?
Does he deny that <hi>diſcipline</hi> was then pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed?
This he does not that I know deny,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:56909:182"/>
concerning thoſe <hi>earlieſt ages,</hi> of which we
are at preſent diſputing. Does he therefore
deny that the <hi>Government</hi> then was <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan?</hi>
This is all he aims at. But what
has he produced <hi>new,</hi> for diſproving what I
have here ſaid to prove it ſo? He ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats
his old Aſſertion, that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> then was
equivalent to our preſent <hi>Market Towns</hi> of
one Pariſh. But I ſee nothing <hi>new</hi> produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to diſprove what I have ſaid to prove
mine, that <hi>Cities</hi> then were <hi>walled and
incorporated,</hi> and included the <hi>Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of the <hi>Countrey</hi> that belonged to them,
and were generally in thoſe places which were
converted by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> as <hi>great</hi> if not
<hi>more great and populous,</hi> as ours are
now; and conſiſting of as great numbers of
Chriſtians of <hi>one denomination.</hi> And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
thoſe <hi>Cities,</hi> which had generally been
<hi>Commonwealths,</hi> including their <hi>Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi>
in the <hi>Country</hi> ſubject to them, how
ſmall ſoever he will fancy the <hi>Cities</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to have been, were yet too numerous to
meet <hi>particularly</hi> in Aſſemblies ſo <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently</hi>
as Chriſtians did meet then, and in
ſuch times of <hi>jealouſie</hi> from an otherwiſe
perſwaded <hi>Government.</hi> I have alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the ſame from the multitude of <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries</hi>
aſſiſting the Biſhop, of which no ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable

               <hi>Biſhops</hi> charge had been <hi>then</hi> no greater
than could have been diſcharged by a <hi>ſingle
perſon,</hi> even this himſelf acknowledges from
<hi>Ignatius,</hi> yet does not ſee how <hi>inconſiſtent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
with his own <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> nor does he
offer to give the leaſt account of it. I have
obſerved that the <hi>multitude of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governours</hi>
was proportionably as great
<hi>then</hi> as <hi>now,</hi> but that the allotting each
<hi>Presbyter</hi> his particular Cure, as it is now
done by the diſtinction of <hi>Pariſhes,</hi> is in
truth a more convenient expedient for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the Government <hi>practicable.</hi> I have
ſhewn that his own decryed Inſtances of
<hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Alexandria</hi> are the onely Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in all Antiquity, of Churches fitted and
confined to the management of <hi>ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi>
I have given an account how ſo great
<hi>multitudes</hi> might notwithſtanding commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
from the <hi>ſame Altar.</hi> To all theſe
things I find nothing here <hi>replied,</hi> nor is it
likely that he thought of them in a <hi>Book</hi>
written ſo long before <hi>mine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſhort, though he have indeed produced
more <hi>Inſtances,</hi> yet I ſee none but what are
reducible to the ſame <hi>Topicks,</hi> and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
already anſwered in generally ſpeaking to
thoſe <hi>Topicks.</hi> I find neither any <hi>new</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
nor any further Improvements of
<hi>old</hi> ones, much leſs any ſatisfactory account
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:56909:184"/>
of my <hi>Arguments</hi> or contrary <hi>Aſſertions.</hi>
So that if this be all he has to ſay, I ſee no
reaſon why I may not leave it to the <hi>Reader
to judge</hi> between us. Theſe are my preſent
thoughts on a <hi>curſory view</hi> of the deſign
and management of his Book, that part eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
wherein I am more particularly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
However I do not prejudge either the
<hi>Reader</hi> or <hi>my ſelf,</hi> if upon a cloſe peruſal
any thing do yet appear, that may deſerve a
<hi>further</hi> examination, more than I ſee yet
any reaſon to <hi>expect.</hi> I ſhall be thankful
to him who will tell me what it is. O that it
would pleaſe God to awaken this good mans
<hi>former zeal</hi> for ſolid <hi>peace and piety!</hi>
Thoſe are things for which his Talents ſerve
better than they do for <hi>Controverſie.</hi> How
much rather would I ſerve him in the <hi>mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
offices</hi> that might be really ſubſervient to
theſe things, than thus contend with him in
theſe <hi>unedifying dividing Diſputations?</hi>
