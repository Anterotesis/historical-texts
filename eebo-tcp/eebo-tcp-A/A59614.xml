            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The SHEE-DEVIL OF Petticoat-Lane:</head>
            <head type="sub">Or a Relation of sundry strange Accidents in the House of Mr. <hi>Freeland,</hi> on <hi>Fryday</hi> the 20th. of <hi>Iuly</hi> last.</head>
            <p>THis following Discourse (being no doubt the effects of Witchcraft) would require a large Prologue, if the limits whereunto we are confined would permit it; as to show what manner of people these Witches are, what strange things have been done by them; of which I might produce many hundreds of examples; together with the sad Catastrophe of such people as deal in those works of darkness: But being confined to a single Sheet of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, we shall presently fall to the work in hand.</p>
            <p>This person, Mr. <hi>Freeland</hi> (a man whose honest ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil carriage hath brought him to be of good repute amongst his Neighbors) about the 16th. or 17th. of this present <hi>Iuly,</hi> entertained into his House a Maid-Servant,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42304:4"/>
of about fourteen Years of Age; but after four dayes entertainment, found such dislike in her as to turn her away; But at the instant before her depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, two Men being at work in the Yard, one of them had tvvo blows on the Back by a piece of Tyle, or Hewed Brick; of which mistrusting his Fellow, asked him the reason why he did so. The other deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it (as well he might) whilst he was busie at his Work, was served in the same manner by this stone Devil; who also blaming the other for abusing him, their feud might have encreased at length to blows, had they not been diverted by the breaking of the Glass-Windows; for now the Stones came out from the Yard into the House, not making Quarrels, but breaking Quarrels; and in a short space had so order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Window, that it was now become a perfect Summer-House. And one thing is to be observed, that these Stones never came in at the broken places, but alwayes took a fresh Pane or Quarrel, till such time that all was broke, which made one there present to say, <hi>The Thrower had a good aim, or he could never have hit so right:</hi> and which is more observable, when the Maid-Servant was within the House, then the Stones came flying inwards; but going into the Yard, then the Stones came as it were out of the House, that betwixt them both there wanted a Glazier to compose the Quarrels.</p>
            <p>Whilst these things were in agitation, the Bungs and Corks out of the Buts in the Sellar began to fly, the Beer spurted out, and every thing appeared there in such a case as threatned a general inundation in the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42304:4"/>
Seller, the Brewers-Servant was present to put a <hi>Remora</hi> to what damages might acrew thereby: but (as he told me himself) endeavors were to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose for stopping one, two or three would want his help, so that not withstanding what means could be used, in a little space the Sellar was so overflown that it was above anckle height in beer.</p>
            <p>Now this I must say in respect of Mr. <hi>Freeland</hi> that as for these strange effects of his beer, it may happen only by the ordinary course of Nature, as by putting Quicksilver into it, and other means as you may read in Mr. <hi>Scot's Discovery of Witcheraft;</hi> but this that I shall mention afterwards, I must conceive is more then comes in the compass of my belief, to think that there was nothing of VVitchcraft in it. For,</p>
            <p>Presently after a Looking-Glass that stood on a Shell in the Kitchin of its own accord flew out of the window into the yard, the good woman of the house, knowing it to be a necessary implement for dressing her in the morning, went and fetcht it in again, and to be the more sure thereof, clapt it on the dresser with a dish upon it, but that was of such little force to withstand those strong things then in agitation, that it flew out from under the dish, and struck one in the room a blow upon the shoulder.</p>
            <p>But what is more strange, one <hi>Rowland Bennet</hi> sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in a Drinking Room besides the Kitchen, a Flag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon that stood upon the Shelf, there came flying Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and struck him upon the Nose, with such vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence as wounded him, and caused a great effusion of blood.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:42304:5"/>
Matters growing thus high, and notice being taken concerning the Maid, that whilest she was within the house, the Stones flew inwards, and being in the yard, the Stones then came as fast out of the house, still fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing her; a mistrust came that these disasters were oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned by her; which made (by a general consent of the Neighbors) that she should be searched, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly was done, and (as I was told by some wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in that employment) there was found under her arms the likeness of Warts (I will not say duggs) very flesh and red; whether such things be ordinary with women (especially those of her age being but 14.) I must confess I am so much a stranger to that Sex, that I can onely plead ignorance unto it; and were it not for the opinion of some who will not believe there is any witches (although the Scripture confirms it) I should not have taken this pains upon me, especially having read so much for Confutation thereof in Mr. <hi>Scot's Discovery of Witchcraft,</hi> only this I shall say, that if there was nothing of VVitchcraft in it, it appears to me extraordinary wonderful.</p>
            <p>One thing (which I had almost forgot) that Mr. <hi>Freeland</hi> seeing his Windows go so to wrack, put up the shutters, but then the pewter in the house began to dance, and amongst the rest a Breader or Flower-Box, came off of the Shelf, and flew at a distance upon a mans shoulder, with so great force, as made him have good cause to remember it.</p>
            <p>Many other things I might insert in confirmation of what is already written, but if any remain dissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied they may be certified by hundreds of sufficient people thereabouts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:42304:5"/>
And now to return to those who are so opininative that there is nothing done by Witchcraft, first I shall produce these lines of the Poet.</p>
            <l>Some Waters have so powerfull been</l>
            <l>As could not only bodies change,</l>
            <l>But even the very minds of men,</l>
            <l>Their operation is so strange.</l>
            <p>It is truth many Cheats have been done; which have passed for matters extraordinary, and many Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries I have read to that purpose; Which hath made many approved Sch<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>llers, to write against the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Magicians, and Inchanters vvhich boast they can do miracles, hear vvhat <hi>Cornelius Agrippa</hi> himself saith, vvho dived as much into this secret as any in his age. <hi>I have tryed oftentimes by the Witches and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurors themselves</hi> (saith he) <hi>that their arts (especially those which do consist of Charms, Impossibilities, Conjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Witchcraft whereof they were wont to boast) to be meer foolishness, doting, lyes, and dreams;</hi> and again in his book of Occult Phylosophy he blameth his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer practice of that art and assigneth the practisers thereof a place vvith <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres,</hi> by vvhich it is doubted, (vve see) by learned men, whether Magicians have such povver as is ascribed to them or no, although no doubt witches have been in all ages; as we may read of the <hi>Witch of Endor, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But some perhaps may think this passage needless tobe inserted in such serious matt<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs, but those vvho
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42304:6"/>
have consulted vvith Magick Books. As <hi>Bodin, Carda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> lib. 15. and others, assert, that in their Magical Assemblies, the Witches never fail to dance, and in their dances they sing these vvords; Har, har, Devil, devil, dance here, dance here, play here, play here, And vvhiles they sing and dance every one hath a broom in her hand, and holdeth it up aloft, and as Mr. <hi>Freeland</hi> told me that vvhiles he stood in his shop, there came running betwixt his legs a pevvter dish (vvell-bovvled that it broke not his shins) and that off of a Shelf in the Kitchen; certainly this Devil (if it vvere a Devil) as he vvas in part mischevious so he intermixed mirth vvithal.</p>
            <p>To dravv tovvards a Conclusion, I knovv Readers vvill have a different Construction of this vvork; some judging that this might be only things Customarily done by Nature: others ascribing it to the highest pitch of Witchcraft, for my ovvn opinion, I do Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that there are such people as Witches, although it be stifly denyed by many, and vvhether Mr. <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> goods vvere bevvitched or no, I shall leave it to the Readers judgment; But this I am informed that as this trouble began on Friday last being the 20 <hi>Iuly</hi> 1666. about tvvo of the Clock in the afternoon, so about 11 at night, the Maid-servant being put avvay, these disturbances ceased and the house hath continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed quiet ever since.</p>
