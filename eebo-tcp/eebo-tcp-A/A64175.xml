            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Next day I <hi>Honing</hi> left, and did begin</l>
               <l>To crosse the North of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> towards Lyn:</l>
               <l>That day I chanc'd a gallant house to finde</l>
               <l>A Master bountifull, and servants kinde:</l>
               <l>I need not tell my Reader where, or who,</l>
               <l>The name of <hi>Oxnet,</hi> all doth plainly show.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Sir <hi>William Paston:</hi> there I found and spake with the <hi>Apelles</hi> of our Age, Mr. <hi>Edward Peirce</hi> Painter, and Mr. <hi>John Stone</hi> was there, whose rare Arts are most exquisitly manifested both in painting, lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and cunning carved Statues in stone.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>That Saturday I went t'a Towne call'd <hi>Reepham,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And as amongst great sinners, I the chiefe am:</l>
               <l>I grieve to see the Churches there demollish'd,</l>
               <l>Sects plenty, and true Piety abollish'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>This Town of <hi>Repham</hi> (or <hi>Reepham</hi>) hath three faire Churches, were standing in one Church-yard, it is sayd they were built by three Sisters; one of them hath beene long decayed and fallen to the ground, onely the Tower stands faire and strong; the other two Churches do serve four Parishes,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62284:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and I could hear no more but three Bels on Sunday there: So that the reckoning is one Church-yard, three Bels, two Chreches, three Steeples, foure Parishes, and one broken Church for Lumber.</p>
            <p>The second of <hi>September</hi> (being Monday) I left <hi>Reepham,</hi> and travelled 18. miles to a Village called <hi>Gayton;</hi> but by the way (at a place called <hi>Brissley</hi>) I was told of a Holy Sister, who by falling back, had risen forward, to the increase of the faithfull: she being reproved falling and rising, sayd it was pure zeale that pricked her on, and that it was done with a Brother, he and she, and every one being bound to do for, and with one another, and I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her kindnesse bestowed this short Epigram on her.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Hath Lust defil'd her purenesse, never match'd?</l>
               <l>No 'twas deceit, she hath been cunny-catch'd:</l>
               <l>It was a rule, she learned of her Mother,</l>
               <l>That 'twas no sin to couple with a Brother.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>But to return again where I left: at <hi>Gayton</hi> there are 2 playn Ale-houses, and one Wine Ale-house; these houses were distant one from the other a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, or two flight shoot: at the first house (where the Wine was) there were fellows swaggering, and ready to draw their fists, there I would not lodge; at the second I would have lodged, but could not, their beds were all taken up; at the third the doors
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62284:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were lock'd &amp; the windows shut, no body at home, the folkes not come home from Harvest worke; forward I knew not whether, and backward I would not goe, and to stand still there was cold comfort for an old weary Traveller, there being no harbour, but a wild Common, nor any company to passe the time withall but 3 or 4 flocks of Geese; in this extremity I espy'd an old-old, very old, neat handed little antient man, to him I went, and told him that I would have lodged at that house, but it was shut up; quoth he the folkes will come home by and by, but I doe not know whether they have any lodging or no, and sure me think you be a clean man, and tis pitty you should lye on the Common, if you will goe home and lye with me, I am an old Widdower, and one bed shall hold us both.</p>
            <p>I thankfully embraced his courteous offer, and went with him, where I sup'd and log'd well, and would take nothing of me; his name is <hi>Sampson Warrington,</hi> in remembrance of whose kindnes I have written this thankfull expession.</p>
            <p>I was told there of a precise holy ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in those parts, who sent his man unto a Pasture ground to see his horse, the fellow went, and brought word to his Master that his horse was <hi>Dead,</hi> dead quoth hee, how dar'st thou tell me my horse is dead? the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low answered, I pray you be not angry, sure I am
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62284:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that if he be not dead, that he is either deceased, or changed his life; well sayd the Master, if my horse be departed, I have lost a good one, <hi>for he was so sure of his feet, that I would have put my life into his hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tuesday September 3. I went 4 miles to a Village called <hi>North-Wooton,</hi> 3 miles from <hi>Linn,</hi> there I was much beholding to my Kinsman Mr. <hi>John Clark,</hi> he gave me large and free welcome, for which to him with his good Wife, my gratitude is manifested; also my thankes to Mr. <hi>Swift.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wednesday I went to <hi>Linn,</hi> where a good old Joviall Lad named <hi>John Scarborow</hi> entertained mee sumptuously (for my Cozen <hi>John Clarks</hi> sake) and also he was somewhat the kinder to me, because he had often heard of me, besides of his own dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ition is free from discourtesie to strangers, I thank him for my fresh fish, my Duck, or Mallard, my lodging, Ale, and Oysters, with the appurtenances. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Linn</hi> was much honoured by King <hi>John</hi> for their Loyalty, for which that King gave them his owne word, and a faire gilt Bole, which they keep as honorable memorialls to this day: it is a faire large stronge Sea Towne, it is now a Garison, the River hat the Sea doth flow thereinto, disperseth it self into many Branches, for the commodious enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62284:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of divers Shires, Counties, Townes, and Places, as <hi>Rutlandshire, Huntingdonshire, Cambridge,</hi> and <hi>Cambridgeshire,</hi> the Isle of <hi>Ely,</hi> &amp;c. those Rivers doe carry and re-carry all maner of goods and Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, so that <hi>Linn</hi> with all those Countreys are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with more Sea-coales then doe come up the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> wood being so scarce that the Rich might blow their nailes, and the poore would bee starved in the Winter for want of fiting in all those Counties, if the Rivers were not.</p>
            <p>. . .Thursday the 5. of September I left <hi>Linn,</hi> and tooke an open passage Boat, being bedewed all day and night, and almost all the Fryday with raine without ceasing, so that, on Fryday I came to <hi>Cambridge</hi> sufficiently pickled: there I tooke up my lodging at the signe of the Rose (one of the best Innes) where I thank Mr. <hi>Brian</hi> and his Wife (my old acquaintance) I had good cheere and lodging <hi>gratis</hi> and welcome; I tooke notice of the Colled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, they stand as fair and stately as ever, and (for any thing that I know) there may be as much lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as ever was, but I saw but few Schollars or Gowne men.</p>
            <p>On Saturday the 7. of September, I was determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to see <hi>Sturbridge</hi> Faire, but by fortune I espyed an empty Cart returning towards London 17 miles to a Towne call'd <hi>Baldock;</hi> by which means I left
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62284:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Cambridge</hi> without taking my leave of Mr. <hi>Brian,</hi> for which I crave his and his Wive's pardon.</p>
            <p>That day I was uncarted at <hi>Baldock,</hi> and footed it 7 miles more to <hi>Steevenedge,</hi> there (at the Faulcon) I stayd Saturday and Sunday, and on Monday I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled to <hi>Hatfield,</hi> and to <hi>Barnet</hi> 17 miles, wher I was discreetly wet and dirty, and took up my lodging at the Bell with a silent Clapper. The next day (being Tuesday) I came home to my house wet and weary in Phoenix Alley, at the signe of the Crowne, near the Globe Taverne, about the middle of Long-A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre or Covent Garden.</p>
