            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The name of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor being then unknown, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on inquiry I find it since to be the work of Mr. <hi>Robert Withers;</hi> who, by the assistance of the English Embassador, procuring admittance into the <hi>Seraglio</hi> (a favour unusual) and by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance many years in those parts, had time, and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to persect his observations.

To me it is sufficient that I have faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully discharged my trust, in publishing since the Authors death, the fruits of his observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and in communicating to the Reader the pleasure, and satisfaction, of perusing a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion full of truth, and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: which, in many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, upon experience he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to attest, who is, Sir,</p>

There is also a little room adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto it, the whole inside whereof is covered with silver plate hatch'd with gold, and the floor is spread with very rich <hi>Persian</hi> carpets of silk and gold.</p>
               <p>There are belonging to the said rooms and lodgings of the King, very fair gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of all sorts of flowers, and fruits that <note place="margin">Gardens.</note> are to be found in those parts; with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny very pleasant walks, enclosed with high Cypresse-trees on each side; and <note place="margin">Cypresse walks.</note> marble fountains in such abundance, that almost every walk hath two or three of them; such great delight doth the <hi>Grand-Signor,</hi> and all <hi>Turks</hi> in general take in them.

Again, sometimes standing upon an high bank, to take the fresh air, holding his arms abroad (as a <hi>Cormorant</hi> sitting upon a rock doth his wings in sun-shine after a storm) court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the weather, and sweet air, calling it his soul, his life, and his delight; ever and anon shewing some notable signes of contentment: nor shall the garden (du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his pleasant distraction) be termed other then <hi>Paradise:</hi> with whose flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers he stuffs his bosom, and decks his <hi>Turbant,</hi> shaking his head at their sweet savors; and sometimes singing a song to some pretty flower, by whose name per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure his Mistress is called; and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering words of as great joy, as if at that instant she her self were there present.

               <p>Besides the aforesaid rooms (which are very many, and serve only for the kings <note place="margin">Womens lodging.</note> own person) there is the womens lodging, (which is in a manner like a Nunnery) wherin the Queen, the other <note n="*" place="margin">Sultana, a Ladie, the feminine gender to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>There are likewise divers rooms, and lodgings built apart from all those afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, <note place="margin">Rooms for Officers.</note> which serve both for the principal officers, and those of mean degree, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so for the basest sort; and are so well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, that not any want can be discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of ought that may be thought requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, and convenient for them.</p>

               <p>In the said <hi>Seraglio</hi> there are rooms for Prayer, Baths, Schools, Butteries <note place="margin">Rooms for many othe uses.</note> Kitchins, Distilling rooms, places to swim in, places to run horses in, places

               <p>At the first entrance into the <hi>Seraglio,</hi>

               <p>On the left side of the Court is the Kings stable, of about thirty, or thirty <note place="margin">Kings stable.</note> five very gallant horses, which his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie keepeth for his exercise, when he pleaseth to run, or sport with his Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

the <hi>Agha's</hi> in the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> Over which stable there is a rowe of rooms, wherein is kept all the furniture of the horses, the which (I having seen both there, and abroad, at such times as they have been used) I can affirm to be of extraordinary value.

               <p>Neer adjoyning to the said stable, are certain buildings for the service of the Officers of the <hi>Divan,</hi> and having passed two thirds of this Court on the same side, there is the room wherein the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van</hi>

               <p>The aforesaid second Court endeth at

a third Gate, termed the Kings Gate, which leadeth into the rooms or lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings <note place="margin">Third (or kings) gate.</note> kept apart for himself, and such Gentlemen, as are to attend upon him continually: neither may any one enter therein, but by absolute leave from the king (speaking of men of great quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty): <note place="margin">Who may enter.</note> but such as are belonging to the Buttry, or Kitchin, and Physitians, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and Sewers, may go in and out with leave only from the <note n="*" place="margin">Capee Aga chief Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain.</note> 
                  <hi>Capee Agha:</hi> who is the chief Chamberlain of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and to him is committed the keeping of this Gate, and he is alwayes at hand (by reason his lodging is near) with a Company of white Eunuchs about him <note place="margin">White Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs.</note> like himself; so that, what is reported of things within this Gate, is for the most part by relation. For either one may not see them, or if he do see them, it must be when the king is absent; and he must be brought in by some man of quality, and Command, by one of the gates at the Sea side; the which also cannot be obtained but with great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and some charge too, for a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification to the guide; they having not onely great regard and respect to their

kings person, but also to his rooms in his absence.</p>
               <p>Having passed the third Gate (the <note place="margin">Audience Chamber.</note> which hath also a very fair porch) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately is seen the aforesaid room ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for publick Audience.

               <p>There is also a row of Summer rooms <note place="margin">Summer rooms.</note> built upon the top of a little hill, which looks towards the Sea side, so well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived with Halls and Chambers, and so pleasantly seated, and richly furnished, that it may well be the habitation of so great a Prince. Amongst which there is <note place="margin">A Hall.</note> a Hall opening towards the East, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set with very fair pillars; which Hall looks into an artificial four-square Lake <note place="margin">A Lake.</note> (which they call <hi>Hawoz)</hi> proceeding from about thirty Fountains which are built upon a kinde of <hi>Tarrase,</hi> of very fine Marble, incompassing the said Lake, the water running from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains

above, down into the Lake: and from the Lake through divers gutters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gardens. Two men may walk a breast upon the <hi>Tarrase;</hi> where they hear the continual, and sweet harmony which the fountains make with leaden pipes, in so much that it is a most delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full place. And in the Lake there is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle boat, the which (as I was enformed) the <hi>Grand Signor</hi> doth oftentimes go <note place="margin">A little boat in the lake.</note> into with his <note n="*" place="margin">Dumb men and jesters.</note> 
                  <hi>Mutes,</hi> and <hi>Buffones,</hi> to make them row up and down, and to sport with them, making them leap into the water; and many times, as he walks along with them above upon the sides of the Lake, he throwes them down into it, and plunges them over head and ears.</p>
               <p>Near unto the said Hall, is his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Bed-Chamber, the walls whereof <note place="margin">Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>There is hanging in the midst of the aforesaid Hall a very great Lantern, the <note place="margin">A Lantern.</note> form whereof is round, and the bars of silver guilt, and set very thick with Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies, Emraulds, and Turkesses: the panes are of fine Chrystal.

Now they being all come together, and every man set in his own place; the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners forthwith begin their suits, one after another, (who have no need of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourneyes, though oftentimes they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure <note place="margin">No need of Attorneyes.</note> the help of a <hi>Chiaush:</hi> for every one may speak for himself) referring themselves to the judgement, and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the <hi>Vizir Azem,</hi> who (if he <note place="margin">The power of the Vizir azem.</note> please) may end all.

which otherwise he alone should be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to undergo; reserving only to himself what he thinketh to be of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est import, and consequence; and the like course doth the <note n="*" place="margin">He which governs in the chief Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zirs absence.

               <p>Thus do they spend the time until it be almost noon; at which hour (one of the <hi>Sewers</hi> being appointed to be there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent) the chief <hi>Vizir</hi> commands that dinner be brought in; and immediately all the Common people depart. So, the room being free, the tables are made <note place="margin">Dinner rites.</note> ready after this manner; there is set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a stool before the <hi>Vizir Azem,</hi> a thin, <note place="margin">Copper plate</note> round, copper plate, tinn'd over, about the bignesse of the bottom of a beer-bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel; at which himself, with one (or two at the most) of the other <hi>Bashawes</hi> do eat; the like is prepared for the rest of the <hi>Vizirs,</hi> which do eat together: and another for the <hi>Cadileschers:</hi> one for the <hi>Defterdars;</hi> and one likewise for the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shawngee.</hi> Having every one a <note n="*" place="margin">Which they cal Pestimaw</note> Napkin spread upon his knees to keep his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments clean, and a great quantity of bread being laid ready round about the said copper plates, immediately the meat

is brought in, and set before them upon the plates in great dishes made after a strange fashion; and still as they have eaten of one dish the <hi>Sewer</hi> takes off that, and sets on another. Their diet is ordinarily, Mutton, Hens, Pigeons, <note place="margin">Diet.</note> Geese, Lamb, Chickens, Broth of Rise and pulse, dressed after divers fashions; and some Tarts, or such like at the last; for in a very short space they make an end of their diner; that which remaineth of the said tables, the Officers of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van</hi> do eat, but they have an addition al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, <note place="margin">Officers diet.</note> and brought them from their Kitchin.

               <p>Dinner being ended, the Chief <hi>Vizir</hi> spendeth some small time about general Affairs; and taking Counsell together (if he pleaseth, and thinks it fit) with the other <hi>Bashawes;</hi> at last he determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and resolveth of all within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and prepareth to go in unto the King (it being the ordinary custom so to do, in two of the four <hi>Divan</hi> dayes, <hi>viz.</hi> upon Sunday, and upon Tuesday;) to render an account briefly unto his Majestie of all such businesses as he hath dispatched.

                  <p>Of the Audience, and entertainment given to Ambassadors.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WHen it falleth out that an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador from any great Prince is to kisse the <hi>Grand Signors</hi> hand: it must be either upon a Sunday, or upon a Tuesday: (for those are the dayes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <note place="margin">Ambassadors Audience.</note> for his Highnesse to give Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) to the end he may not be troubled at other times. And then the <hi>Vizir</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth that there be a great <hi>Divan,</hi> which is done by calling together all the <hi>Grandees</hi> of the <hi>Port;</hi> all the <hi>Chiaushes,</hi> all the <note n="*" place="margin">These are horsemen, but of a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er rank then Spahees: the word signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth set a part, or different.</note> 
                  <hi>Mutaferrakas,</hi> and a great number of <hi>Spahees</hi> and <hi>Janizaries;</hi> who are every one of them commanded by their Captains to apparel themselves in the best manner that they are able, and to go every one to his place in the second Court, and there to stand in orderly ranks: making indeed a very goodly shew, for they are very well clothed, and are most of them of comely personage.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Divan</hi> being all in order, (and few, or no common businesses han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled for that day) the <hi>Vizir,</hi> sendeth
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:45279:19"/>
the <hi>Chiaush Bashaw</hi> with many of his <hi>Chiaushes</hi> on horse-back to accompany the Ambassador: who being come to the <hi>Divan</hi> is set face to face close before the chief <hi>Vizir,</hi> upon a stool covered <note place="margin">Ambassador entertained at the Divan</note> with Cloth of Gold. Having for a while complemented, and used some friendly discourse together, the <hi>Bashaw</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that dinner be brought: the which is done after the same manner as upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Divan</hi> dayes (only the round plate on which the meat is set is of silver; and the victuals are more delicate, and in greater abundance.) And so the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador, and the <hi>Vizir Azem,</hi> with one or two of the other <hi>Bashawes</hi> do eat toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And for every such banquet at such times the <hi>Grand Signor</hi> alloweth (besides the ordinary <hi>Divan</hi> diet) a thousand <note place="margin">A thousand crowns al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> Crowns to be spent: howbeit I dare say the Steward makes the one half to serve the turn, and reserves the rest to himself.</p>
               <p>They having dined, the <hi>Vizir</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the Ambassador with some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, until such time as the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors followers have dined also, (who I can upon experience affirm are served af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a very mean fashion) and then the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45279:20"/>
Ambassador, together with his own at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants retire themselves into a certain place near the kings gate: where he must stay till such time as all the orders of the <hi>Divan</hi> have had audience of the king, who being dismissed do all depart, (the <hi>Bashawes</hi> excepted, who for the <hi>Grand Signors</hi> honour are to stay, and attend in the room upon his Majestie.) But by the way I must not omit to relate, how that the present, which the Ambassador brings along with him, is carried (whilst he sitteth in the said retiring place) once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the second Court in open sight of the people, (be it what it will be) and so in unto the King.</p>
               <p>Then the Ambassador is called by the <note place="margin">Master of the ceremonies.</note> master of the ceremonies, by whom he is brought to the gate where the <hi>Cape<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45279:20"/>
him back after the same manner to the lower end of the room, where he stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth till such time as the said two <hi>Capoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chee Bashawes</hi> have lead such of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors gentlemen, as are appointed to kisse the Kings hand also.

                  <hi>Druggaman</hi> declareth the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors commission, to which the <hi>Grand Signor</hi> makes no answer at all (disdaining to speak to a Christian) but only speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a word or two to the chief <hi>Vizir</hi> to license him; referring all proceedings to his discretion. And so the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor departeth, doing obeisance to the <note place="margin">His depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> King, with bowing down his head, but pulleth not off his hat, or cap at all.</p>
               <p>There is one particular, belonging to this ceremonie, worth the observation, which is this; that there is not any time, any person whatsoever, aswell Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, as other, which is to kisse the <hi>Grand Signors</hi> hand, but he is vested with a vest given him by the <hi>Grand Signor:</hi> and <note place="margin">Vesting.</note> to this end, before the Ambassador go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in unto the king, the <hi>Uizir Azem</hi> sendeth him so many vests, as are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by <hi>Canon,</hi> for himself and his gentlemen; who put them on in the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:45279:21"/>
place where the Ambassador stayeth till the King send for him to give him Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. These vests are of divers sorts; of which there is one or two for the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors own person of cloth of gold of <hi>Bursia;</hi> the other being of a low price, worth little or nothing.</p>
               <p>But on the contrary, in lieu of those vests, there is not any Ambassador (which is to go to the King for his first audience) or <hi>Bashawe</hi> (who at his return from some imployment abroad, is to kisse his hand) but they present to him the full value of what the <hi>Canon</hi> requireth: in <note place="margin">Recompence</note> so much that the <hi>Grand Signor</hi> receiveth more then he giveth, twentie fold. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the <hi>Bashawes</hi> (over and above the ordinary duty) do give him exceeding rich presents: and oftentimes great sums of money too; that by all means they may continue in his grace and favour.</p>
               <p>Other Ambassadors, which come from petty Princes, or States, howbeit they are vested also with vests given them by the <hi>Grand Signor:</hi> yet they come not to the <hi>Divan</hi> in that pomp, neither are they feasted as the others are; but go privately, carrying their present with
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:45279:21"/>
them: howsoever they are also led in unto the King after the aforesaid man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. It is to be noted, that all Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors from absolute Princes; aswell ordinary, as extraordinary, (excepting <note place="margin">All Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors but the Venetian at the Kings charge.</note> those from the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> to whom, from their first introduction it was denied:) all, I say, lie at the charges of the <hi>Grand Signor.</hi> For from his own store, they have allowed them, wheat, barley, pulse, wood, coals, hay, the custom of their wine; and many other necessaries for their houshold ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense, and from the <hi>Defterdar</hi> so many <note n="*" place="margin">Ten aspers make six pence.</note> aspars <hi>per diem</hi> as the <hi>Vizir</hi> shall think fit. Which provision, though now of late it be very hard to be gotten; yet by great importunity and gifts, (without which there is no good to be done) in the end they receive a great part of it; but the officers will share with them do they what they can: such is their base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and slender account, of either ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or honesty.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Of the persons which live in the</hi> Seraglio; <hi>and chiefly of the Women, and Uirgins.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving thus far made a description of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> it self, and the buildings which are therein; with some particulars belonging unto it, according to that which I have both seen, and heard from others, which are daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant there: it followeth that I now speak somewhat touching those which dwell in it, and of their several qualities, and employments.</p>
               <p>First then I say, that all they which are in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> both men and women, are the <hi>Grand Signors</hi> slaves (for so they stile themselves) and so are all they which <note place="margin">One Lord, the rest slaves.</note> are subject to his Empire. For, besides that he is their Soveraign, they do all acknowledge that whatsoever they do possesse, or enjoy, proceedeth meerly from his good will, and favour: and not onely their estates, but their lives also are at his dispose, not having respect either to the cause, or manner. So that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:45279:22"/>
in my opinion, the attributes they give unto him are proper, and fitly suting with the condition of such a Prince. For he is stiled sometimes <note n="*" place="margin">This word signifieth an expeller of princes: but some will have it to come of Pawd and shooh, which is an expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of injury, or injustice: but amongst the Turks it is used for an Emperor; and they give the same title to the Emperor of Germanie, calling him Nem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>s Pawdishawh.</note> 
                  <hi>Paudishawh,</hi> and sometimes <note n="*" place="margin">This is a Persian word, and signifieth a man of blood, or one which causeth blood; but used for King.</note> 
                  <hi>Hoonkeawr.</hi> In regard of soveraignty and justice, they may truly call him <hi>Paudishawh;</hi> but in regard of his tyranny, <hi>Hoonkeawr:</hi> both which words they use in the same sense as we do the word, king.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Seraglio</hi> may rightly be termed the seminary or nursery of the best sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. For in it all they have their edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, who afterward become the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal officers, and subordinate rulers of the state, and affairs of the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: as hereafter I shall shew at large.</p>
               <p>They which are within the third gate, <note place="margin">Two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand within the kings gate.</note> called the Kings gate, are about two thousand persons, men and women; whereof the women (old and young one with another; what with the Kings concubines, old women, and women-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants) may be about eleven or twelve <note place="margin">11 or 1200 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

hundred. Now, those which are shut up for their beauties, are all young virgins <note place="margin">Virgins.</note> taken and stollen from forraign Nations: who after they have been instructed in good behaviour, and can play upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, sing, dance, and few curiously; they are given to the <hi>Grand Signor</hi> as presents of great value: and the number of these encreaseth daily, as they are sent, and presented by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> by the <hi>Bashawes,</hi> and other great men, to the King, and Queen. They do likewise sometimes decrease, according as the <hi>Grand Signor</hi> shall think fit. For upon divers occasions, and accidents, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth many of them to be turned out of this <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and to be sent into the old <hi>Seraglio:</hi> which is also a very goodly, and spacious place, of which hereafter I shall take occasion to make mention. These Virgins immediately after their <note place="margin">Virgins made Turks, and how.</note> coming into the <hi>Seraglio</hi> are made <hi>Turks;</hi> which is done by using this cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony only; to hold up their forefinger, and say these words; <hi>law illawheh illaw Allaw, Muhammed resoul Allawh;</hi> that is, <hi>there is no God but God alone, and Mahomet is the messenger of God.</hi> And
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45279:23"/>
according as they are in age and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition (being proved, and examined by an old woman called <hi>Kahiyah Cadun,</hi> that is, as we say, <hi>the mother of the maids)</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Kahiyah Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dun, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the maids.</note> so they are placed in a room with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the same age, spirit, and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to live together.</p>
               <p>Now in the Womens lodgings, they <note place="margin">Their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of life.</note> live as Nuns do in great Nunneries: for these virgins, have very large rooms to live in, and their bed-chambers will <note place="margin">Chambers.</note> hold almost a hundred of them a piece. They sleep upon <hi>Sofaes,</hi> which are built long-wise on both sides of the room, and a large space left in the midst to go to and fro about their businesse.</p>
               <p>Their beds are very course, and hard <note place="margin">Beds.</note> (for the Turks neither use featherbeds, nor corded bedsteads) made of flocks of wooll: and by every ten virgins there lies an old woman: and all the night long there are many lamps burning, so that one may see plainly throughout the whole room: which doth both keep the young women from wantonnesse, and serve upon any occasion which may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the night. Near unto the said bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chambers they have baths for their use <note place="margin">Baths.</note>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:45279:24"/>
at all times, with many fountains, out of which they are served with water: and above their chambers there are divers rooms, where they sit and sew: and there <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>They feed by whole <hi>Camarada's,</hi> and are served, and waited upon by other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: nor do they want any thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever that is necessary for them.</p>
               <p>There are other places likewise for them, where they go to school, to learn <note place="margin">Schooling, and mistres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> to speak, and read (if they will) the Turkish tongue, to sew also, and to play on divers instruments: and thus they spend the day with their mistresses, who are all ancient women: some hours not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding being allowed them for their recreation, to walk in their gardens, <note place="margin">Recreations.</note> and use such sports as they familiarly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise themselves withall.</p>
               <p>The king doth not at all frequent, or see these Virgins, unlesse it be at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, when they are first presented unto him; or else in case that he desire one of them for his bed-fellow, or to make him some pastime with musick, and other sports: wherefore, when he is prepared
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:45279:24"/>
for a fresh mate, he gives notice to the said <hi>Kahiya Cadun</hi> of his purpose; who immediately bestirs her self, like a crafty baud, and chooseth out such as she judgeth to be the most amiable, and fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of all; and having placed them in good order in a room, in two ranks, like so many pictures, half on the one side, and half on the other; she forthwith brings in the King, who walking four or <note place="margin">The Kings coming to them.</note> five times in the midst of them, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving viewed them well, taketh good no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice within himself of her that he best liketh, but sayes nothing; only as he goeth out again, he throweth a handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief into that virgins hand; by which <note place="margin">His choice.</note> token she knoweth that she is to lie with him that night: so she being (questionless) exceeding joyful to become the object of so great a fortune, in being chosen out from among so many to enjoy the society of an Emperour, hath all the art, that possibly may be, shown upon her by the <hi>Cadun,</hi> in attiring, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ainting, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuming her; and at night she is brought <note place="margin">Preparatives</note> to sleep with the <hi>Grand Signor</hi> in the womens lodgings, where there are cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers set apart for that businesse onely.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:45279:25"/>
And being in Bed together, they have <note place="margin">Bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber rites.</note> two great wax lights burning by them all night; one at the beds feet, and the other by the door: besides there are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed (by the <hi>Cadun)</hi> divers old Black moor women, to watch by turns that night in the chamber, by two at a time; one of them to sit by the light at the beds feet, and the other by the door; and when they will they change, and other two supply their rooms, without making the least noise imaginable, so that the King is not any whit disturbed. Now in the morning when his Highness riseth (for he riseth first) he changeth all <note place="margin">Reward.</note> his apparell from top to toe, leaving those which he wore to her that he lay withall, and all the money that was in his pockets, were it never so much; and so departeth to his own lodgings; from whence also he sendeth her immediately a present of jewels, money, and vests, of great value, agreeable to the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and content, which he received from her that night. In the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he deals with all such as he maketh use of in that kinde; but with some he continueth longer then with other some,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45279:25"/>
and enlargeth his bounty far more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards some then others; according as his humor, and affection to them encreaseth, by their fulfilling his lustful desires.</p>
               <p>And if it so fall out, that any one of them doth conceive by him, and bring forth his first begotten child; then she is called by the name of <hi>Sultana Queen:</hi> and <note place="margin">Sultana Queen.</note> if it be a son, she is confirmed, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished Queen by great feasts, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities; and forthwith hath a dwelling assigned unto her apart, of many stately rooms well furnished; and many servants to attend upon her.</p>
               <p>The King likewise alloweth her a large <note place="margin">Her allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</note> revenue, that she may give away, and spend at her pleasure, in whatsoever she may have occasion; and all they of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> must, and do acknowledge her for Queen, shewing all the duty, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect that may be, both to her self, and to them that belong unto her.</p>
               <p>The other women (howsoever they bring forth issue) are not called Queens; yet they are called <hi>Sultana's,</hi> because <note place="margin">Other Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas.</note> they have had carnal commerce with the King: and she onely is called Queen, which is the mother of the first begotten
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45279:26"/>
son, heir to the Empire; the which <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana's,</hi> being frequented by the King at his pleasure, have also this prerogative; to be immediately removed from the common sort, and to live in rooms apart, exceeding well served, and attended; and have no want, either of money, or apparrell, in conformity to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
               <p>All these <hi>Sultana's</hi> do resort together very familiarly, when they please; but not without great dissimulation, and inward malice; fearing lest the one should be better beloved of the <hi>Grand Signor</hi> then the other; yet notwithstanding this their jealousie, they (in outward shew) use all kind of courtesie one towards an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
               <p>Now if it happen that the first begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son of the Queen, heir to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, should die, and another of the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana's</hi> should have a second son, then, her son being to succeed the deceased heir, she is immediately made Queen: and the former shall remain a <hi>Sultana</hi> only, and be deprived of the aforesaid <note place="margin">The Queen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:45279:26"/>
by vertue of the sons succession.</p>
               <p>In times past the Queen was wont to be wedded to the King; but now she passeth without the <hi>Kebin,</hi> that is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an assignment of any joynture, or celebrating the nuptial rites: which is nothing else, but in the presence of the <note place="margin">Nuptial rite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The reason why the Queens are not now (nor have been of late yeers) espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, is, not to dismember the Kings patrimony of five hundred thousand chicquins a year.

But now the said revenue being otherwise employed, the <hi>Bashawes</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:45279:27"/>
do endeavour, as much as in them lies, to keep the <hi>Grand Signor</hi> from marrying. And so much the rather, because they would have none to rule but the King alone; howsoever (married, or not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried) the mother of the heir is by every one called, and acknowledged for Queen; and presented with many rich presents from all great personages: and hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually at her gate, a guard of thirty, or fourty Black Eunuchs, together with <note place="margin">Guard of black Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs.</note> the <note n="*" place="margin">Kuzlar Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ha signifieth, master of the Virgins.</note>

                  <hi>Kaiks,</hi> there is Canvas pitched up on both sides, and none may come near them but black Eunuchs, till they be setled, and covered close in the room at the stern of the Barge; and then go in the Barge-men; so that in fine, they are never seen by any men, but by
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45279:27"/>
the <hi>Grand Signor</hi> onely, and the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs.</p>
               <p>The Kings daughters, sisters, and aunts, <note place="margin">The Kings daughters, &amp; sisters &amp;c.</note> have their lodgings also in the same <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio;</hi> being royally served, and very sumptuously apparelled, and live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by themselves, in continuall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures; until such time as, at their request, the King shall be pleased to give them in marriage: and then they come forth of that <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and carry each along with <note place="margin">Portion chest.</note> them a chest, which the <hi>Grand Signor</hi> gives them, full of rich apparrel, jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, and money; to the value of (at the least) thirty thôusand pounds sterling a chest; and that is (as we call it their portion. They carry likewise along with them all that they have hid from time to time, unknown to any but to themselves; amounting sometimes to a great matter, and stands them in good stead all their whole life time. And if so be that they be in the <hi>Grand Signors</hi> favour, and that he be disposed to deal royally with them; then they are suffered to carry with them out of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> such women slaves as they please, (provided they do not exceed the number of twenty a piece) <note place="margin">Slaves and Eunuchs.</note>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:45279:28"/>
and such Eunuchs as they like best for their service.</p>
               <p>These also being called <hi>Sultana's,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve still, so long as they live, their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of money, which they had whilst they lived in the Kings <hi>Seraglio,</hi> some a thousand, and some a thousand five hundred afpars a day: the slaves also and the Eunuchs do likewise enjoy their former pensions.</p>
               <p>Their houses are furnished, both with houshold stuff, and other necessary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision, from the Kings <note n="*" place="margin">Treasury.</note>

               <p>And if so be that a <hi>Bashawe,</hi> having married one of them, be not provided of a house fit for her, then the King giveth her one of his, (for he hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which fall to him by the death of great persons) that her house may be sutable with her greatnesse and quality.</p>
               <p>Now, for the husbands part, he is on the contrary to make her a bill of dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, <note place="margin">Bill of dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note> ordinarily of at least a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand chicquins in money, besides vests,

               <p>They being thus married, do not at all <note place="margin">Privatenesse.</note> converse with men, more then they did when they lived in the Kings <hi>Seraglio</hi> (except with their own husbands) but with women only; and that is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Visitings<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

them, then any other kinde of present whatsoever.

And in this case, finding themselves to be wealthy, they may marry with men of reasonable good quality, according to the measure of their portion, or estate, which they possesse: and the good will, and good report of the mistresse of the old <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio</hi> on their behalf, is none of the least furtherances, and helps in that businesse;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:45279:31"/>
but the <hi>Grand Signors</hi> consent must be had thereto, notwithstanding: who will (for the most part) not only be made fully acquainted with the condition of their husbands, but also will know what joynture they will be content to make them, if in case they should put them away, without their own consents, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise leave them widows. Thus by reason of their being turned out of the Kings <hi>Seraglio,</hi> it is often seen, that though the daughter of the King be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to a <hi>Bashawe;</hi> yet the mother of <note place="margin">The daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter preferred before the mother.</note> that daughter (after the Kings decease) must be content with a second husband of small account, far unequal, and much inferiour, both in title, wealth, and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to her Son in Law.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sultan's</hi> have leave of the <hi>Grand Signor,</hi> that certain Jew-women may at any time come into the <hi>Seraglio</hi> unto <note place="margin">Jewesse wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> them; who being extraordinary subtill, and coming in under colour of teaching them some fine, and curious needle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, or to shew them the art of making <note place="margin">Their arts.</note> waters, oils, and painting for their faces, (having once made way with the better sort of the Eunuchs, which keep the gate,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45279:31"/>
by often feeing them for their egresse, and regresse) do make themselves by their crafty insinuations so familiar, and so welcome to the Kings women, that (in a manner) they prevail with them, in whatsoever they shall attempt for their own ends. For these are they whom the <hi>Sultana's</hi> do imploy in their private oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions; carrying out whatsoever they would have sold, and bringing in unto them any thing that they have a desire to buy. And hence it is that all such Jew-women, as frequent the <hi>Seraglio</hi> do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very rich. For what they bring in, <note place="margin">Their false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dealing.</note> they buy it cheap, and sell it dear to them: but on the contrary, when they have jewels, or the like commodities to sell for the <hi>Sultana's,</hi> (which are to be conveyed out by stealth) they receive a reasonable price for them of strangers, and then tell the simple Ladies, who know not their worth (and are afraid to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scovered) that they sold them peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the half of that which they had for them. And by this means there come things of great worth out of the <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio,</hi> to be sold abroad at easie rates: yet in the end the husbands of those Jew-women
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:45279:32"/>
have but a bad market of it. For being discovered to be rich, and their wealth to be gotten by deceit, they oftentimes loose both goods and life too; the <hi>Bashawes</hi> and <hi>Defterdars</hi> alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <note place="margin">

               <p>They are taken from such families, as are supposed to be of the best spirit, and most warlike disposition; nor may they, when they are gathered, exceed twelve, or fourteen yeers of age at the most, lest they should be unfit for a new course of life, and too well setled in Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity to become good Turks.

which are youths kept also in the <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio,</hi> but in far better fashion then the <hi>Agiam oglans:</hi> and are (for the King, and countreys service brought up in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in the knowledge of the laws, and in military exercises: that they may in time be made able to perform those things, which belong to the government of the whole Empire. And albeit for the most part these are Christian captives, and Renegado's, yet there are some na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural born Turks amongst them (which must be youths of very comely aspect, and their outsides must promise a great <note place="margin">Turks hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admitted.</note> deal of worth, and goodnesse) brought in by the <hi>Capee Aghas</hi> means (who is chief Chamberlain) with the Kings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent: but this happeneth but very sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and is effected with great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For the ancient institution was, that the <hi>Itchoglans</hi> should alwayes be made of Christian Renegado's, and captives onely, of the most civil, and noblest that could be found.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, when in the wars, either by sea or land, it happens, that any youth <note place="margin">Noble ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptives.</note> is taken, who is discovered to be of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parents, and comely personage; or if

any such voluntarily come, and offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to become Turk (as divers have done in hope of advancement) he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently markt, and set apart for the <hi>Grand Signor;</hi> and is (so soon as he is thought capable and apprehensive) instructed in matters of government (being as it were ordained for great employments.) Now such are of very great esteem: for the Turks themselves affirm, that noblenesse of birth cannot but produce the most vertuous, and generous spirits; especially when it is seconded, and accompanied with good education, which is professed in the <hi>Seraglio:</hi> where there is great se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity used in all the orders of discipline, the government of them being in the hands of masters, who are white Eunuchs for the most part, and very severe, and <note place="margin">Eun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For the blowes which they suffer, and the fastings which are commanded them for every small fault are to be admired: nay, some of <note place="margin">Punishments.</note>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:45279:40"/>
them are so cruelly handled, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their time of being in the <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio</hi> be almost expired: and that they should in few years come forth to be made great men, yet not being able to endure such cruelty any longer, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to be turned out, contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with the title, and small pay of a <hi>Spahee,</hi> or a <hi>Mutaferraka,</hi> rather then be so often punished, and made weary of their lives, in evpectation of great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments.</p>
               <p>The number of these <hi>Itchoglans</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain.

               <p>The course that is taken with them, so soon as they come into the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> is admirable, and nothing resembling the barbarisme of Turks, but beseeming men of singular vertue, and discipline.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:45279:41"/>
their speech, and that of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar sort.</p>
               <p>Here also they begin to learn to wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, to shoot in the bowe, to throw the <note place="margin">Fifth bodily exercises.</note> iron mace, to tosse the pike, to run, and to handle their weapons, &amp;c. And in these exercises, in their severall orders, and several places, they spend their hours; being severely punished if they shall in any wise grow negligent.</p>
               <p>They spend likewise other five, or six yeers in this <hi>Oda;</hi> whence (being become men, strong, and fit for any thing) they are removed to the third <hi>Oda;</hi> where, <note place="margin">Third school</note> (forgetting nothing of what they learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, but greatly encreasing their <note place="margin">Sixth, hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship and activity.</note> knowledge) they also learn to ride, and how to behave themselves in the wars.</p>
               <p>Moreover, every one of them (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he is thought fit for it) here learns a trade, necessary for the service of the Kings person, <hi>viz.</hi> to shave, to make up a Turbant, to fold up apparel handsome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note place="margin">Seventh, Trades.</note> to pair nails, to attend at the <hi>Bagno,</hi> to keep hawks, and land-spaniels, to be Sewers, Quiries of the stable, target<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers, to wait at table, and the like: as hereafter I shall shew; so that having

been in these offices a few yeers they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come men able to teach others.</p>

Nay when they have occasion to go to the <hi>Bagno,</hi> or the like businesses, the Eunuchs are alwayes at hand, that so by all means they may be kept from lewdnesse. And in their Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chambers,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:45279:42"/>
which are long rooms, and <note place="margin">Bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</note> hold about thirty or fourty in each of them, (for they sleep near one another upon <hi>Sofas)</hi> there are every night lamps burning, and Eunuchs lying by them to keep them in awe, and from lewd, and wanton behaviour.</p>
               <p>In the third <hi>Oda,</hi> some of them do also learn ordinary mechanick arts, as sewing in lether (which is in great use and esteem amongst the Turks) to mend guns, to <note place="margin">Sewing in leather, &amp;c.</note> make bowes and arrows, and quivers, and the like; from which trades they often have both their sirname, and their repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation too. For they are much made of, who will be diligent, and flie idlenesse: holding it rather an honour, then an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy, to have a trade. For therein they imitate the <hi>Grand Signors</hi> themselvs, who (for good example sake) in their youth are taught some trade, or other; which although they never practise when they are Kings, yet they are willing their subjects should know, that they are able to do it, if they please. And divers great men, nay <hi>Bashawes</hi> themselves, <note place="margin">They take their cogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina from Trades.</note> both have been, and are to this day called by the names of such arts, as they
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:45279:43"/>
practised, when they were in this <hi>Oda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here also the Eunuchs (their tutors) make tryal of their constancy in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, searching (as far as in them lies) their hearts to see how they stand affected to <note place="margin">Tryal of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> Turcism. For the time growing near, wherein they are to passe to the fourth <hi>Oda</hi> (which is the chiefest, and last, and from which they are called to businesse of great importance) they would not then have them at all remember, that they were formerly Christians, or to have the least desire imaginable to turn to their first belief; lest that they should in time, by some stratagems, and politick courses, peradventure prove disadvantageous to the Turkish Empire. So then all possible proof, &amp; tryal being made, &amp; they found to be perswaded of the truth of that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; they then are preferred to the fourth <note place="margin">Fourth School.</note>

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:45279:43"/>
                  <hi>Oda.</hi> For they are immediately ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the <hi>Grand Signors</hi> own service, <note place="margin">Preferments.</note> and have their pay encreased, some more, and some lesse, unto eight aspars a day, and their habit chang'd from cloth to silk, and cloth of gold of great price.</p>
               <p>Now here their punishments cease: but <note place="margin">Punishments cease.</note> they continue still with their heads, and beards shaven; onely they suffer some locks to grow on each side, from their Temples, which hang down below their ears, for a signe that they are the next, which are capable of the preferment of coming into the Kings chamber.</p>
               <p>They must be very cleanly and neat in their apparel before they come about the <note place="margin">Neatnesse.</note> 
                  <hi>Grand Signors</hi> person; many of them ever accompanying his Majesty, when he goes abroad upon pleasure (provided, none of his women be with him.) And they may now freely converse with all the great men of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and with the <hi>Bashaws</hi> also: and are often present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with gifts by men of the best quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to insinuate into their favour; hoping that they one day may become men of great command, and so be able to stand them instead in their occasions.</p>

a prince (howbeit it is not intended that he should go) presently informs himself what that Prince usually doth present the Embassador withall; and so accordingly agreeth with a <hi>Chiaush,</hi> or with one of such like quality, to undertake the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage; who must give for the same, as they two can agree between themselves; either in ready money before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, or otherwise at his return; as the <hi>Aga</hi> shall think best for his profit, and so forthwith he dispatches the party chosen.</p>

               <p>But if his Majestie be not pleased, or the occasion do not require so highly to exalt some one of the aforesaid <hi>Agas,</hi> as to be of the degrees already named; he then makes him <note n="*" place="margin">Lord of Graecia, or of Natolia.</note>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Grand Signor</hi> having bestowed any of the said places upon them, they forthwith leave the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and carry with them all their estates both money and goods: and oftentimes take with them other young men of the other <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> who are permitted to go through their own hastinesse and great importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, not being willing to stay out their

               <p>Such as are to go out upon the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est imployments, are accompanied forth of the Kings <hi>Seraglio</hi> by the <hi>VizirAzem;</hi> who also presenteth them, and giveth them entertainment for three, or four dayes in his house: until such time as they can be provided of houses of their own, whither afterwards they repair, and set their families in order; taking also unto them such as are come out of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> with them for assistants, and ministers, in the charge assigned unto them.

Nor can this course be altered, unlesse by some sinister acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, or evil behaviour they fail thereof: so that it is alwayes known amongst
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:45279:47"/>
themselves, who is next capable of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick imployment; nay the businesse is so orderly carried, and their course so regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, that even they of the third <hi>Oda</hi> do know what their future fortunes will be, if they live to enjoy them. And indeed all of them live in continual hope, and desire, that the <hi>Grand Signor</hi> would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten be pleased to send them abroad; that so they may the sooner be out of their hard service in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the state of ample government. It is no marvail then the Turkish officers are so often changed, seeing that every <hi>Grand Signor</hi> hath so many servants of his own that seek for advancement.</p>
               <p>They are most commonly of five and thirty, or fourty yeers of age, before they are sent abroad: and because they come out of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> with their beards shaven, they are fain to stay within doors, for some dayes to let them grow, that they may be fit to come amongst other great men: with which staying at home, they are very well contented. For in that time they receive the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents, <note place="margin">Presents from great persons whilst they stay.</note> which are sent them from all the <hi>Sultana's,</hi> of vests, shirts, linnen breeches,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:45279:48"/>
and handkerchiefs, of all sorts, richly wrought, and of great worth; and from the <hi>Bashawes,</hi> and other great men, horses, carpets, vests, slaves, and other things, fit for the erecting, and furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an house, and family: the which presents are made the greater, and richer, by so much the more as the party, to whom they are given, is known to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, and beloved of the King.</p>
               <p>Now so soon as their beards are grown, they go abroad, and begin their visits; <note place="margin">Coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad and visitings.</note> first, to the chief <hi>Vizir,</hi> and then in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the other great ones, till they have been with them all; and last of all they offer their service to the <hi>Capee Aga</hi> in all humble manner, acknowledging that <note place="margin">Capee Aga visited.</note> their best fortunes, and honours, have been conferred upon them by his means, and promising for ever all dutiful respect unto him for the same.</p>
               <p>But this complement with the <hi>Capee Aga,</hi> is performed without the gate on the Kings side, which is kept by the white Eunuchs: for they may not come any more within that gate, unlesse they be called for by the King, for to treat of things belonging to their imployments, before their departure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:45279:48"/>
They all strive to gain the love, and good will of the <hi>Capee Aga,</hi> that he may be as a protector, and patron unto them, and that, when they are absent, he may possesse the <hi>Grand Signor</hi> with a good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion <note place="margin">The power of the Capee Aga.</note> of them: for they know he is very powerful with him, being the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and alwayes nearest to the King.</p>

                  <hi>Mutes</hi> both old and young, who have liberty to go in and out at the Kings gate, with leave only of the <hi>Capee Aga.</hi> It is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:45279:49"/>
the observation, that in the <hi>Seraglio</hi> both the <hi>Grand Signor,</hi> and divers that are about him, can reason, and discourse with the <hi>Mutes</hi> of any thing: as well <note place="margin">Discourse by signes.</note> and as distinctly, <hi>alla Mutescha,</hi> by nods and signes, as they can with words; a thing well befitting and suting with the gravity of the better sort of Turks, who cannot endure much babling. Nay, the <hi>Sultana's</hi> also, and many other of the Kings women do practise it, who have many dumb women and girls about them for that purpose.</p>
               <p>This hath been an ancient custome in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> to get as many <hi>Mutes,</hi> as they can possibly finde; but chiefly for this one reason, which is, that they hold it a thing unbefitting the <hi>Grand Signor,</hi> and not to sute with his greatnesse, to speak to any about him familiarly; wherefore he takes this course, that he may the more tractably, and domestical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly jest, and talk with the <hi>Mutes,</hi> and with others that are about him, to make him pleasant with diversity of pastime.</p>
               <p>The King, besides this, makes another use of them; and that is, when his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie <note place="margin">A further use of them.</note> resolves with himself to put a <hi>Vizir</hi>

to death, or some one of that rank, and that he be willing to see it done with his own eyes in the <hi>Seraglio;</hi> he then having called him into one of his rooms, and holding him in discourse, whilst his <hi>Mutes</hi> are in readinesse, (the poor man perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture <note place="margin">Mutes stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle men in the Seraglio.</note> suspecting nothing) he makes but a signe unto them, and they presently fall upon him, and strangle him, and so draw him by the heels out of the gates.</p>
               <p>But that which in my opinion is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in these <hi>Mutes</hi> (who being born <note place="margin">Mutes can write.</note> deaf, and so of necessity must remain dumb) is, that many of them can write, and that very sensibly and well: now how they should learn without the sense of hearing, I leave to others judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: but I am sure I have seen it, and have my self made answer unto them in writing.</p>
               <p>It followeth now that I speak of the white Eunuchs, who as the black ones <note place="margin">White Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs.</note> are for the service and attendance of the <hi>Sultana's,</hi> and for keeping of their gate: so are the white Eunuchs appointed for the King, and his gate.

               <p>They are brought up with the <hi>Itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oglans,</hi> and are instructed in many things <note place="margin">Their edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the four Odas,</note> aswel as they; being removed also from one <hi>Oda</hi> to another; and are last of all taken out by turns from the fourth <hi>Oda,</hi> for to serve the <hi>Grand Signor,</hi> aswell as those which are not Eunuchs.</p>

               <p>NOw as concerning the Black Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs, and Black-moor wenches, which serve the <hi>Sultana's,</hi> and the rest of the Kings women: it is to be noted, that the black Eunuchs, whilst they are boyes, are for the most part kept, and <note place="margin">Black Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs.</note> taught among the other youths of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> as the white ones are, untill <note place="margin">Their educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> they come to age, and are made fit for service.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:45279:55"/>
and especially from the Jews wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who are daily conversant with them. The reason why their pension is so great (in comparison of others) is, that they can never be sent abroad in any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, thereby to enrich themselves as the other can; but must for ever stay, and serve in the <hi>Seraglio.</hi>

               <p>Now after their coming, if they shall be disliked by reason of some infirmity, then are they sent into the old <hi>Seraglio,</hi> as the white women are, when they are unfit for service, or mis-behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; all which is done by the Kings order, and consent.</p>
               <p>The aforesaid black Eunuchs, by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of being sent with messages to the <note place="margin">Black Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.</note>

               <p>But if she, which is sick, be the Queen, or one of the <hi>Sultana's,</hi> (with whom the <hi>Grand Signor</hi> hath layen) then her arm and hand, which she holdeth out of the bed for the Physician to feel her pulse, is covered with a fine piece of white silk, or Taffata sarcenet.

               <p>From five years of age until ten (du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time they live amongst the women) they have their <hi>Hojah</hi> (that is, <note place="margin">Hojah, or school-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</note> their School-master) appointed them by the King to teach them to write, and

               <p>This sort of dried flesh, (after that it is sufficiently dried, and hardened, with <note place="margin">Hanged up, and dried.</note> hanging a moneth, or better, in some upper room, and little, or no salt used about it, but pressed very flat) will last the whole year following, and eat very

savourly. And it is in such great use a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Turks, &amp; so well liked of, that there is scarce any Master of a family, if he be of ability, but doth yearly against winter make his provision of it; and it is held a very thrifty and sparing course. For that then fresh meat would be very dear. But they do not all make their <hi>Basturma</hi> of cowes great with calf, (that is for the <hi>Seraglio)</hi> for there are many which love the other better, which i made of Oxen and Bullocks; and they can buy it far cheaper.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Bashawe</hi> (as I said) hath the care, <note place="margin">400 Cowes great with calf spent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very year to make Bastur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</note> and oversight of what is prepared for the Kings kitchens, and there are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly spent four hundred cowes every year for the said provision of <hi>Basturma;</hi> there is also fresh beef spent in the <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio:</hi> but the quantity is uncertain.</p>

There is very little store of fish spent in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> either shell-fish, or other: <note place="margin">Fish.</note> yet sometimes the <hi>Agas</hi> for dainties will eat some.

               <p>The <hi>Grand Signor</hi> (nor any of his wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or servants in the <hi>Seraglio)</hi> cannot <note place="margin">Fruits.</note> want for fruit: there being at time of year so many presents, of all sorts of fruits, brought thither, besides what comes from the Kings own gardens (which are many, and near the city) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very morning in great abundance, and excellent good; especially, figs, grapes, peaches, and <note n="*" place="margin">Melous.</note>

For as she is presented by many; so is it <note place="margin">The Queens expenses.</note> fit that she should in part make some compensation: and to that end, she hath an allowance of vests, and other things in great abundance: besides she hath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to dispose of many of those which have been worn by the King.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Uizir Azem</hi> is also a giver at the <note place="margin">The Vizirs gifts.</note> Kings charge; aswel whilst he is in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> as when he is upon depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as General of the <hi>Grand Signors</hi> army, to the wars: and to that end be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he departeth, he hath brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him from the <hi>Hazinehdar Bashawe</hi> a great number of vests, and other things that he may be provided, when he is in the field, with presents according to the Turkish custom: which (in all busines<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and upon every occasion) is, to give, and take.</p>
               <p>The King (if he please) may at any time go abroad out of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by water, or by land: when he goes by water he hath his <hi>Kaik,</hi> or <hi>barge</hi> of sixteen, or eighteen banks, with a very sumptuous, and stately Poop, covered
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:45279:73"/>
over with crimson velvet richly embroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, under which he himself sits, and none but he upon cushons of velvet, and cloth of gold; his <hi>Agas</hi> standing all on their feet, holding with one hand by the side of the <hi>Kaik,</hi> and only the <hi>Bustan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gee Bashawe,</hi> who steers the barge, may now and then sit down, that he may han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the helm the better. Now the <hi>Bustan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gee Bashawe,</hi> by reason the King talks much with him in the <hi>Kaik</hi> (at which <note place="margin">Mutes how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> time, lest any one should hear what they say, the <hi>Mutes</hi> fall a howling like little dogs) may benefit, or prejudice whom he pleaseth: the <hi>Grand Signor</hi> being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ignorant of divers passages, and apt to beleeve any information, either with, or against any subject whatsoever. His barge is rowed by <hi>Agiamoglans,</hi> which are brought up in that exercise, and indeed they mannage the businesse very well and nimbly; not sitting at all when they row, but as they fetch their stroak, they step up upon the next bank before them, and so with the stroak fall <note place="margin">Their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> backward flat on their backs upon the next bank behinde them: much resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the manner of rowing in the gallies.</p>
               <p>

When he goes forth by land, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes <note place="margin">His going out by land.</note> rides on hors-back, and goes out (commonly) at the greatest gate, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at such times as he is to go to the <hi>Moschea,</hi> or Church, which is upon the Friday (it being their Sabbath) and is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied into the city by all the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shawes,</hi> and other <hi>Grandes</hi> of the <hi>Port,</hi> besides many of his own houshold ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants which go by his stirrup, and his <hi>Agas</hi> riding after him; having divers <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacks</hi> also with their bowes, and arrowes, <note place="margin">Solacks, or bowe-men.</note> which go before him for his guard. And as he rides along the streets, he salutes the people with nodding his head to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, who again salute him with loud shouts, and prayers of prosperity, and happinesse; and for recompence, <note place="margin">Gratulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications.</note> the King oftentimes puts his hand into his pocket, and throwes whole handfuls of money amongst them. Now they of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> which go along by his stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup, have charge to take all such Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as are preferred to his Majesty as he rides along either to, or from the <note place="margin">Petitions - preferred.</note> 
                  <hi>Moschea:</hi> and many poor men, who dare not presume, by reason of their rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged apparel, to approach neer unto so
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:45279:74"/>
majestick a prefence, stand afar off with fire upon their heads, holding up their petitions in their hands, the which the <hi>Grand Signor</hi> seeing (who never despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, but rather encourageth the poor) sends immediately to take the <hi>Arzes,</hi> or petitions, and being returned home in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his <hi>Seraglio,</hi> reads them all, and then gives order for redresse as he thinks fit. By reason of which complaints, the King oftentimes takes occasion to execute the fury of his wrath, and displeasure, even upon the most eminent in place, before they are aware, without taking any course in law against them (onely acquainting the <hi>Muftee</hi> with his design, who seldom or never doth oppose him) but causing a sudden execution of what punishments he pleaseth upon them; either putting them to death, or at the least, turning them out of their places. For as he stiles himself <note n="*" place="margin">The worlds refuge.</note> 
                  <hi>Awlem penawh,</hi> so he would have the world to take notice, that such as lament unto him, shall be sure to have redresse, and succour from him; although his ministers fail them, or abuse them through their injustice. Which makes the <hi>Bashawes,</hi> and other great officers,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:45279:75"/>
that they care not how seldom the <hi>Grand Signor</hi> stirs abroad in publick, for fear lest in that manner their unjust proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and bad justice should come to his ear. And indeed they alwayes live in great fear, through the multiplicity of businesse that passeth through their hands, and in danger of loosing their lives at a short warning (as it hath been ever observed, that few <hi>Uizirs</hi> die in their beds) which makes them use this Proverb: <hi>that he that is even the greatest in office, is but a statue of glasse:</hi> but notwithstanding their brittle estate, bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery <note place="margin">Proverb.</note> hath so bewitcht them, that hap, what will hap, he that will give most shall be sure to speed at their hands.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Grand Signor,</hi> for the use of his houshold, hath in <hi>Constantinople</hi> at a place called <note n="*" place="margin">That is the stable wharf, or gate. The Kings great stable.</note> 
                  <hi>Ahur Capsee,</hi> near unto the <hi>Seraglio;</hi> an exceeding large stable of a thousand horses and upward: and the <note n="*" place="margin">Chief ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the horse, the true word is Emeer-Ahor which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth Lord of the stable.</note> 
                  <hi>Imrohor Bashawe,</hi> which is Master of the horse, hath the charge of them, as of all his other horses, mules, camels, and all his cattle whatsoever, and of all the kings hay, and provender: having an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Imrohor</hi> for his assistant, besides ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:45279:75"/>
ordinary grooms which are to look to them, and see that the <note n="*" place="margin">Horse-keepers.</note> 
                  <hi>Seises</hi> keep them in good case. Now the said <hi>Imro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor Bashawe,</hi> and his Deputy, are to see the <hi>Grand Signors</hi> servants provided of horses, at such times as they accompany his Majesty abroad, either solemnly at showes in the city, or abroad at hunting, or otherwise as the King pleaseth.</p>
               <p>Besides this stable, he hath divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in other places, both for his own <note place="margin">Other stables</note> service, and for the use of his Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, at such times as he, or they shall come thither: namely, at his Gardens, and houses of pleasure abroad in the countrey, to which his Majesty useth to go very often; but these stables have not above eight, or ten horses a piece in them. For to those houses he carrieth but few followers with him, and those few are the chiefest <hi>Agas</hi> of all.</p>
               <p>He hath also stables of stallions for race in <hi>Bursia, Adrianople,</hi> and in divers <note place="margin">Stallion horses.</note> other places; from which are brought to <hi>Constantinople</hi> very stately colts; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides such as are continually sent him for presents from <hi>Cairo, Damascus, Bagdat,</hi> and other places by the <hi>Bashawes,</hi> he
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:45279:76"/>
hath also many which fall to his share by the death of great persons: all which are horses of great price, and kept for his own use.</p>
               <p>But because there must be a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of horses, for ordinary services of the baser sort of servants, the King is therefore furnished with low prized nags <note place="margin">His nags from Wala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia.</note> out of <hi>Walachia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides the aforesaid stables of horses; the <hi>Grand Signor</hi> is provided of five thousand <hi>mules,</hi> kept near to <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mules.</note> which serve to carry <hi>Pavillions,</hi> chests, water, and all other necessaries for travel: but because the <hi>Vizir Azem</hi> (at his going out General) makes use of a great part of them, there is seldom that number com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat at home. And should the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self go out to the wars in person, his very houshold would use a thousand of them, besides their riding horses. For the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman</hi> Emperors are almost aswel accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated in their voyages abroad, as they are at home in the city; and indeed the generality of the Turks are so well fitted, against such times as they are to go forth, especially for long journeyes, as I think no people in the world can go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond them.</p>

The other women of this <hi>Old Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio</hi> have but mean allowance; and had they not somewhat of their own to help sometimes, they would pass but coursly; so that they are fain to betake themselves <note place="margin">Hard state.</note> to their needles, by which they in part sustain themselves, and reap a reasonable benefit.

not rise above the degree of a <hi>Sanjack Beg,</hi> or a <hi>Capoogee Bashawe,</hi> to the end they may be kept under, being allied to the crown; that so being but in mean places, they may not be apt to rebel. But their brothers which their father begat of slaves, may come to be <hi>Bashawes;</hi> for <note place="margin">Bashawes sons kept under, if of royal blood.</note> they are free from suspicion, in regard they are not of the blood Royal. And hence it is, that those children, which had a <hi>Sultana</hi> to their mother, are so often seen to be in lower degree then the others. For, for the aforesaid reason, he which is born of the slave, is above him that is born of the <hi>Sultana.</hi> Yet with the children of the other subjects it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; for they are all equals.</p>
               <p>The parties married, may upon divers occasions specified in their law, leave one <note place="margin">Divorces.</note> another: especially when they cannot agree, and live peaceably together. And if the man puts away the woman, then he is bound to allow her the joynter, which he promised her, when they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted before the <hi>Cadee,</hi> and witnesses: but if the woman forsake the man, then she can recover nothing; but departs onely with a small portion, such as she

               <p>These slaves are bought, and sold, as beasts, and cattle are, they being viewed, <note place="margin">Manner of selling slaves</note> and reviewed, and felt all about their limbs, and bodies, and their mouths lookt into, as if they were so many horses in <hi>Smithfield;</hi> then they are examined of what countrey they are, and what they are good for; either for sewing, spin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, weaving, or the like; buying some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the mother with the children, and sometimes the children without the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, sometimes two or three brothers together, and again, sometimes taking the one, and leaving the rest, using no terms of humanity, love, or honesty, but even as the buyer, or the seller shall think will best turn them to profit.</p>

               <p>They say moreover, that the power of God is such, that having at the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of man prefixed, and appointed a set time for his end, it is impossible that the wit or device of mortal man, should <note place="margin">Fate.</note> be able to divert, or prevent it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the wars, and in all other occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they are so much the more bold, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, and couragious; being persuaded that their end is written in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads,

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:45279:88"/>
and privately rebukes him for it.</p>
               <p>The like course is taken by many, which come to the <hi>Muftee</hi> himself to be resolved of some point in Law; lest that the <hi>Muftee</hi> should know either par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by naming them, and so lean to what side he pleaseth: but after this manner he cannot easily deceive them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Muftees</hi> chief employment is, to answer all such propositions as are made unto him, upon cases of conscience, and the rites of the Turkish Law. The which answers are in few words, very brief, and they are called <hi>Fetfa's;</hi> that is, declarations, or judgements of the <hi>Muftee;</hi> with which he may compel, not only the <hi>Cadees,</hi> and <hi>Bashawes</hi> to the performance of the contents thereof; <note place="margin">His power.</note> but the Kings own person is also bound to see them executed, and to stand to his decree. For they seek altogether to am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie this sect of lawyers, in honour of their prophet the Lawmaker; and the <hi>Muftees</hi> Authority is so much the more regarded, for that he is upheld very stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the whole order of the <hi>Cadees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Muftee</hi> hath his revenue a part in land of about six thousand <hi>Sultana's</hi>

               <p>And although this <hi>Muftee</hi> hath not an absolute rule, and command over the <hi>Muftees</hi> of other parts of the Kings do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions; yet by his policie he ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails with the <hi>Grand Signor,</hi> and effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth whatsoever he undertakes, especially when he hath the <hi>Uizir Azem</hi> to his friend, who in degree, dignity, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is his superiour.</p>
               <p>Next to the <hi>Muftee,</hi> there are two <hi>Cadeeleschers,</hi> that is to say, <hi>Judges</hi> of the Armies, one of <hi>Graecia,</hi> and the other of <note place="margin">Cadeeles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</note>

               <p>In the times of trouble, and affliction, they publish in the most eminent places <note place="margin">Other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations and prayers.</note> a convocation of all the chief men, and Ecclesiastical persons in the city (and of the common people also such as will come, may) to pray in the fields which are for that use; (therein imitating the Jews) and being all come together; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of their <note n="*" place="margin">Holy men, Sermons.</note> 
                  <hi>Santons,</hi> (esteemed for their shew of holinesse) make sermons of exhortation to fortitude, patience, and to the love and fear of God: but if those troubles continue still, they then use the prayers of fourty hours, and of fourty dayes (for they are so called) in the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>Moscheas</hi> built by the Emperors: which prayers are said by a company of

Church-men, who are belonging to the said <hi>Moscheas,</hi> and if all fail, then they fall to sacrificing; for that is held to be of <note place="margin">Sacrificing.</note> greatest force to put away evil, and the best thanksgiving for benefits received.</p>
               <p>All the ceremonies, which they use in the <hi>Ramazan,</hi> or moneth of fasting, are no other, but to abstain from eating and <note place="margin">Ramazan ceremonies.</note> drinking in the day time.

               <p>I remember, that <hi>Nasooh Bashawe</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Vizir Azem,</hi> and riding through the <note place="margin">Example of severity.</note> streets in the moneth <hi>Ramazan,</hi> espied a

               <p>The <hi>Grand Signor</hi> useth in the <hi>Rama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan,</hi> aswel as in the times of troubles, and afflictions; (and so do the <hi>Bashawes,</hi> and other great men) to sacrifice divers sorts of beasts, both at the sepulchers of such as have been held for holy and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant men, and at the <hi>Moscheas</hi> too, now some do it privately, but the Kings have still command, that their sacrifices be done publickly, and in the open streets, and at the gates of the city; dividing the flesh of the beasts among the people, yet some part of it is sent to the <hi>Bashawes</hi> themselves, and to the other grandees of the <hi>Port.</hi> These sacrifices are used ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often.

die: but they go to see the places, which he most frequented, as being a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous prophet, who raised the dead to life, healed the sick, gave sight to the blind, and wrought many such wonders, which never any prophet could do but he. They go likewise to the valley of <hi>Jehoshaphat;</hi> for they say, that in that place shall be <note place="margin">Valley of Jehosha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Now all such as have gone the said pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage, and return home again to their <note place="margin">Pilgrims.</note> houses, are ever after called <hi>Hagees,</hi> that is, pilgrims, and are very much reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and esteemed of all men. There are also divers Turks, who forsaking the world, leave all that they have and go to live, neer to the foresaid vally, for devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and to be nearer to the place of resurrection, supposing thereby to get a great advantage to themselves, above the rest at that day.</p>
               <p>Many there be likewise, which professe a kinde of living out of the common course, and custome of the world, being clothed wonderfull poorly, and raggedly, with white felt caps on their heads, that beg for their living, and lie in the courts of the <hi>Moscheas,</hi> and in such like places;
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:45279:95"/>
and these are accounted very holy men. For they pray much in the view of the world, and live alwayes (in outward appearance) in the love of honesty: preaching this doctrine to the standers by, that it is impossible perfectly to arrive unto, and gain the love of God, but by the ladder of humane love, and innocency; and for this cause they betake themselves to that course of life, that they may be in charity with al the world, and be accepted of God, and rewarded for it in Heaven; under which colour of holiness they live at ease, and deceive the world, every one being bountifull unto them. For the poore, simple, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people do dayly throng about them, receiving their benedictions, for which they give them money. They go many times up and downe the city, from house to house, singing certain prayers for the prosperity of the family; and seldome, or never go away empty.</p>
               <p>Besides them, there are also some, who (like Hermits) live in rocks, and on the sides of mountaines, and in other solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry places, neglecting the world, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that course of life to excell all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:45279:95"/>
for innocency, and holiness; to whom also many men, and women do resort, and give money for their prayers, and benedictions.</p>
               <p>The greatest ceremony (for pomp, and solemnity) which is used amongst the <note place="margin">Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>rks, is that of circumcising their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; wherin they greatly differ from the Jews in this one particular. For the Turks never circumcise them, till they be past ten years of age, following the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Ishmael,</hi> whom they imitate; alledging that <hi>Abraham</hi> loved him, and not <hi>Isaac,</hi> and that it was <hi>Ishmael</hi> whom <hi>Abraham</hi> would have sacrificed.</p>
               <p>Until the very day of circumcision, <note place="margin">The lock of Hair.</note> they let a lock of hair grow on the crowne of the head, as long as may be, but afterwards they cut it shorter: and the reason why they must let it grow is, only to shew that they are not as yet cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised: until which time they are not accounted perfect <note n="*" place="margin">True Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</note> 
                  <hi>Mussulmen,</hi> nor may till then pray in the congregation; they wear the lock broided, and plaited, and hanging downe the middle of their back, over their uppermost coat, that every one may see it. This circumcision is done
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:45279:96"/>
without the Church, because of the shedding of blood; all the kindred, and friends being invited unto it, in token of joy, and gladnesse. They use the like ceremony with those, which turne from any other religion, and become Turks; who, in token that they embrace the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> do (before they are circumcised) hold up their forefinger and say these words, <hi>Law illawho illaw Allhah ve Muhammed resul Alla,</hi> that is, There is no God, but God alone, and <hi>Mahomet</hi> is the messenger of God.</p>
               <p>There are in the cities, and by the high wayes also, in most places of the <hi>Grand Signors</hi> dominions, for the benefit both of the inhabitants, and travailers, divers * <hi>Hawns</hi> (commonly called <note place="margin">Canes.</note> 
                  <hi>Canes)</hi> in which wayfaring men do lodge, and refresh themselves, and their horses: there are also Hospitals in Cities, <note place="margin">Hospitals &amp; Colledges.</note> and Colledges for the bringing up of youth, where they may learn to read, and write; every <hi>Moschea</hi> built by the Emperors, and all other great <hi>Moscheas</hi> having large revenues, out of which (by the will of the founders) the said Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and Hospitals are maintained.
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:45279:96"/>
For the Emperours by Canon, should not build any Churches, but in memory of some notable conquest, or memorable <note place="margin">Limited.</note> enterprise, by which the Church may be provided for: nor <hi>Sultana's</hi> neither may build, unlesse it be the Queen mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to that Emperor who reigns at that time when she goes about it. For the building of which, they are at infinite charge, dedicating them with great so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities for the said victory, be it what it will be. When an Emperor builds a <hi>Moschea,</hi> and that it is almost finished, <note place="margin">A ceremony at the finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chea.</note> and the main <hi>Cupola,</hi> or round roof is to be laid on, to cap, or crown as it were the whole fabrick; then are invited all the <hi>Bashawes,</hi> and other great men to come to the solemnity, but every one of them doth send the day before, his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of vests of cloth of gold, velvet, sattin, &amp;c. all which being that day hanged upon cords, on the out-side of the top of the Church, the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> himself comes thither, and being set under his pavillion in the Church-yard, all the chiefest of them (to whom he also giveth vests) kiss his hand one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: this being ended the <hi>Mustee</hi>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:45279:97"/>
makes a Prayer, and then the <hi>Cupola</hi> is put on, and this is their consecration; the said vests, which were hanged up, being afterwards shared amongst the master workmen.</p>
               <p>The same ceremony is also used among the Turks in building of their houses, at the closing up the roof. For they invite their friends, who either send them vests, or handkerchiefs, and hang them up af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the said manner, which also fall to the workmens share; the guests are feast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their pains, &amp; that is the warming of the house, as we call it in England.</p>
               <p>In these <hi>Moscheas</hi> there are some very costly pieces of work, and exceeding <note place="margin">Moscheas.</note> well set forth, and proportioned; aswel for the largeness, and neatness of those places where the people pray; as also for the beautifull porches, galleries, and <note place="margin">Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</note> large paved Courts which compasse the said <hi>Moscheas,</hi> being adorned with very stately pillars, &amp; fountains built all of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Marble, besides their colledges, and hospitals near unto them, to which (as I said) belong very large revenues: insomuch that some of those <hi>Moscheas</hi> may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the richest Churches in the world. They are built all of wonderful fair
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:45279:97"/>
stone, with <hi>Cupola's</hi> covered all over with lead; the pillars within the churches being either of <hi>Porphiry,</hi> or some such costly stones, and the basis thereof all whited. Now the pillars in time of prayer shine <note place="margin">Lamps.</note> most gloriously, by reason of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of lamps that are burning: the which lamps are curiously fastned into round iron hoops, in compass as big as the hoop of a butt; upon which there are divers rounds of lamps one above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and are let downe by copper chains from the roof of the church: in every <hi>Moschea</hi> there are three, or four such circles of lamps, or more, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">No seats.</note> to the bigness of the Church.</p>
               <p>There are no benches in the <hi>Moscheas,</hi> nor any thing to sit upon; only a little place raised from the ground for the priests, and another right over against it (but somewhat lower) for the <hi>Grand Signor,</hi> at such times as he comes to prayer; all the rest sitting upon the ground, as ordinarily they use to sit in other places: wherefore the pavements (although they are of very bright, and clean stone) are covered with very fine mats of <hi>Cairo,</hi> which are kept wondrous <note place="margin">Mattes.</note> neatly. For besides the <hi>Grand Signor</hi>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:45279:98"/>
no man may come into the Church with his shoes on; but must leave them at the door, or else give them to their servants to keep. <note place="margin">Sicknesse.</note>
               </p>
               <p>When any one is dangerously sick, and in their iudgements past hope of recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; then they send for the <note n="*" place="margin">Priest.</note> 
                  <hi>Imawm,</hi> who comes, and useth comfortable speeches unto him, and prayeth by him, and the party dying, they wash him all over with water, then having wound him up in his <note place="margin">Manner of burying.</note> 
                  <hi>Kefin,</hi> or winding sheet, and layed him in a coffin with his face downward, they carry him to his grave with his head for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most. Now if the party that is dead be a man, or a manchild, then they set a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant upon the coffin; and if it be a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or a girle, then they set a <hi>Filian Takya</hi> upon the coffin, for distinctions sake; that is such a cap as the women wear, with a brooch, and feather in it. Again, if the party be a virgin, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes (provided they be people of <note place="margin">Garlands, and boughs of oranges.</note> quality) set garlands, and boughes of Oranges upon the coffin. They are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied to the grave by the Church-men, and their own kindred, and many strangers also, which pass by, willingly go along with them (for they hold it a
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:45279:98"/>
very meritorious work to see the dead well buried) but no women at all; (yet women may afterwards both weep, and <note place="margin">Women go not to buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls. No Lights.</note> pray upon their graves) nor do they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry any lights in their hands, or censers, or howle, and cry after them as the Greeks do; but the <note n="*" place="margin">Clerks.</note> 
                  <hi>Muyezins</hi> sing all along as they go, calling upon the name of God, and their Prophet <hi>Mahomet;</hi> and praying for the health of the soul departed: and at their returne there is some kind of course banquet made to the company for their pains.</p>
               <p>The Tombs of the Emperors most commonly are built upon the ground, <note place="margin">Tombs of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</note> close by their graues, and on each grave there stands an empty coffin, covered either with extraordinary fine cloth, or else with velvet; having Turbants set upon them of the fashion of those which the Emperors themselves did wear, with brooches, and sprigs of feathers in them: and there stand great candlesticks both at the head, and at the feet of the said graves, and two lamps burning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually day and, night. Now these tombs are for the most part built in little chappels close by (but not adloyning) to the <hi>Moscheas</hi> of the said Emperors, there
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:45279:99"/>
is no great store of workmanship about any of their tombs. For they are of the fashion of a chest, about seven foot long, and about two foot and half broad: either side is cut out with flowers, guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded over, and at each end an <hi>Epitaph.</hi> Now in these chappels there are <hi>Muye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zins,</hi> and <hi>Derveeshes,</hi> who by turns con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually read in the Alcoran, and pray with their beads, for the glory of the Emperors deceased. The <hi>Uizirs, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shawes,</hi> and other great men also (imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Emperors) do the like, but with less pomp, and charge: and they which have no burying places neare the <hi>Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheas,</hi> may make them neare their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling houses, and be buried there, or if they please in any other part of the city, provided that the ground whereon they build their tombs be their owne. The common sort are carried out of the city, <note place="margin">Common tombs.</note> and buried in the fields, which serve only for that purpose; having one stone set upright at the one end of their grave, and another at the other end, for a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that one hath been buried there (for by the law, howsoever it is not strictly observed, they ought not to bury where
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:45279:99"/>
one hath been buried before) upon which is graven the name, degree, and countrey, or any thing else that they please of the parties deceased. Besides, if it be the Tomb of a man of quality, they usually set a Turbant cut out in marble upon the head of it: or if a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men then a cap of marble, such as the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, wear.</p>
               <p>Amongst the Turks there are no Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous houses, or monasteries, unless the <note n="*" place="margin">Colledges</note> 
                  <hi>Teckebs</hi> of the <hi>Meulevees,</hi> which are an order of <note n="*" place="margin">holy men professing innocency.</note> 
                  <hi>Derveeshes,</hi> that turne round with musick in their Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. The Turks generally are bred up to Arms, and very few can write, or read; Nay it hath been sometimes seen that a <hi>Bashawe, Vizir</hi> of the <hi>port</hi> (which had not his education in the kings <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio)</hi> hath sate to do Justice in the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van,</hi> and hath not known either to write, or read; but hath beene enforced of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity to learn to write a few words of course, for the signing of command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, bills, warrants, and the like. And among the Turks, he that can but read, and write, is held a very learned man, and esteemed of far above others, by the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:45279:100"/>
common ignorant people: insomuch that when a crafty fellow hath got a book, which he knows will please their humors (they altogether delighting in books like <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>As for the women, there is no heed ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, or reckoning made of their religion at all; therefore I speak of it last, but <note place="margin">Womens Religion.</note> for modesty sake, I must conceale what the Turkes are not ashamed sometimes to Judge of them. For they never go to Church, so that if they happily have a <note place="margin">Women go not to church</note> will to pray at the hours of prayer, they do it in their own houses, using the same preparations as the men do. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less their honesty, and good carriage is

               <p>And although the women may not be conversant with any other men, then with their husbands, fathers, or brothers, and although they live in lodgings apart, by themselves, out of the sight of men, and go alwayes abroad with their faces covered; yet many of them being extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily wanton, are very dishonest, &amp; lascivious, who taking the opportunity of their husbands absence, at the wars, or in some long Journey, under colour of going to the <hi>Baths,</hi> and being cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red withall, go whither, and to whom they lust, knowing that the worst of it is to be put away, if so be it should at any time be discovered.</p>
