         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The CASE of
Iohn Dunton Citizen of London:
In a Letter to Mr. George Larkin, Senior.</head>
            <opener>My very good Friend,</opener>
            <p>I Receiv'd your obliging Letter, which I had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
much sooner, had I not been prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a <hi>Second Fit of Sickness,</hi> which <hi>I</hi> was in
hopes would have been my last; and as it
had brought me even to the Door of Death,
would have also let me into Eternity; and thereby
have prevented me from disclosing what I cou'd
wish might remain Buried (as it has done hitherto)
in Eternal Silence.—But since the good Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of GOD has thought fit to bring me back
from the Grave, I thought my self oblig'd to return
you an Answer to your Letter. I cannot blame
you for wondering at my <hi>Long Absence from my own
House,</hi> which methinks even to <hi>Me</hi> appears so <hi>strange,</hi>
that had I not those <hi>Reasons</hi> for it that I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
conceal'd from all the World <hi>(and which
I am sure are Iustifiable in the sight of GOD and Man)</hi>
I shou'd not know how to answer it to my self.—But
your kind Advice to me, <hi>To hasten my Return
Home,</hi> (which I look upon as an Effect of <hi>our Old
Friendship)</hi> has at last prevail'd with me to disclose
to you what I always resolv'd to have lock'd up in
the silent Closet of my own <hi>grieved and afflicted</hi>
Heart. You will not wonder at what I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
writ, when I shall tell you, I must unavoidably
reflect upon the great Unkindness of my <hi>Honoured
Mother-in-Law</hi> and <hi>my Dear Wife,</hi> of whose Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> your Self are a
Witness how very tender I have been: And I had
some hopes that <hi>what Praises I gave 'em in the Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin-Scuffle,
would have Engag'd 'em Both to have been
as kind as I there Represent 'em.</hi> But I was mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
for they were not to be <hi>flatter'd into Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But tho' my <hi>Praises</hi> were all lost, yet I still hop'd
<hi>(for a Drowning Man will catch at any thing)</hi> that
<hi>the Essay I writ on knowing our Friends in Heaven,</hi>
(being <hi>more Satyrical)</hi> wou'd have made 'em <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous;</hi>
and the rather (for so I was told) as my <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Neighbour</hi> came on purpose to desire 'em
<hi>not to starve themselves, but rather as they had a Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Fortune, to make some use on't:</hi> And I think this
was good Advice, for <hi>who'd starve himself to inrich
his Heir?</hi> ('Tis no Abuse to the good Creatures of
God, moderately to enjoy them.)</p>
            <p>Sir, You may remember I gave you one of these
<hi>Essays</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but I told you nothing of what I
design'd by it: Here in <hi>Dark Hints,</hi> that no body
can understand but themselves (that so I might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
their Reputation, and shew 'em their Error at
the same time) is a <hi>History of the
Furious Treatment</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">This is own'd in two Letters sent to me in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and which I'll Print if I see Occasion.</note> (or <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-Moon,</hi>
it being so soon after our
Marriage) that I receiv'd from
'em, from the <hi>Second Day I was
Marry'd,</hi> to the time I Embark'd
for <hi>Ireland.</hi> And had you seen
in what manner they began their <hi>Reign</hi> (which was
too <hi>Arbitrary</hi> to last any long time) you'd think me
very obliging to condescend to a Reconciliation.</p>
            <p>But seeing none cou'd understand that <hi>Essay</hi> but
themselves, I do intend <hi>(if they tye up my Hands
from doing Iustice, or Print any false Stories)</hi> to write
a <hi>Narrative</hi> of this March, from the time <hi>Madam
Nicholas</hi> (my <hi>Pious</hi> Mother-in-Law)
invited me by Letter<note n="b" place="margin">A Copy of which I'll Print if they Answer this.</note> to court
her Daughter, to the time their <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Carriage</hi> frighted me to <hi>Ireland;</hi>
in which shall be inserted the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages</hi>
that were sent upon that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and the <hi>PRIVATE LETTERS</hi> that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
past between the <hi>Mother</hi> and the <hi>Daughter;</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:59887:3"/>
with a <hi>Diary</hi> of their <hi>Quarrels</hi> at my House, which
was now chang'd from a <hi>Family of Love, to a meer
Billingsgate.</hi> And this attested by <hi>TWO PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SONS</hi>
that then liv'd in my Family. And (my
<hi>Friend)</hi> did you but know (as all that came to
my House observ'd) <hi>in what a Hell I liv'd, for the
Four First Months after I was Marry'd,</hi> you'd rather
Incourage, than Disswade me, from Writing of this
<hi>Narrative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, Mr, <hi>Larkin,</hi> I tell it you as a <hi>Secret,</hi> (tho'
I shou'd and will be Master of my own House) their
<hi>Furious and Cavetous Treatment</hi> has frighted away all
my Friends from the <hi>Raven,</hi> except Two, that
come out of Curiosity to see 'em, that they may
more sensibly lament my Case; which you will
think doleful, when I tell you, That I am so very
<hi>VXORIOUS, (as appears by my
living with my First</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">
                  <hi>Read her Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Sermon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled,</hi> The Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a good Woman, <hi>and you'll be convinc'd of the Truth of this.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Wife,
15 years, without hearing or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
one Angry Word)</hi> that had
<hi>Mother</hi> or <hi>Daughter</hi> but <hi>One Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
Quality,</hi> I cou'd yet doat
upon 'em.</p>
            <p>But so it is, my Friend, (my
<hi>Two Sicknesses</hi> this year hindring
me in the disposing of my <hi>Remaining Stock)</hi> things
are now come to that Upshot, that I must lay my
self under the Imputation of a <hi>very Vnkind Husband,</hi>
or else make it appear that my <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Mother</hi> are
<hi>very Vnkind to Me.</hi> And yet to Expose those for
whom I have so <hi>Tender a Love,</hi> tho' it be only to
your self (in whose Brest I am satisfied I may lock
up these <hi>Secrets</hi> without fear of Discovery) is that
which I know not how to do, without a very great
Reluctancy: And yet without my <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Mother</hi>
will be willing to Accommodate things better than
at present I have any grounds to hope, what I now
only impart to your self, I am afraid I must ere
long be forc'd to declare to the whole World in
my <hi>Iust Vindication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that I may leave you no longer in the dark,
as to the Cause of my <hi>Present Retirement</hi>—You
must know, my <hi>Friend,</hi> That my being Bound for
my <hi>First Wive's Sister</hi>'s <hi>Husband,</hi> and Five hundred
Pounds loss at Sea, in a Ship that was Cast away;
some hundred Pounds Loss in Printing a large <hi>Folio,</hi>
two thick Volumes of the <hi>Edicts</hi> of <hi>Nants,</hi>—and
the long and chargeable Sickness of my First Wife,
together with the Charges of her Funeral <hi>(for I
thought it my Duty to shew a great deal of Love to a
Wife that despis'd the World, when it stood in Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with my Esteem)</hi> had run me considerably into
Debt; which notwithstanding by my own Punctual
Payments, and the <hi>Prudent Silence</hi> of my first Wife,
in altogether concealing my taking up Money upon
my own Estate, was wholly hid from the World;
<hi>so that my Reputation receiv'd no Diminution</hi>—Upon
this, when I was to be married to my present Wife, I
nakedly told my Mother-in-Law that I was 1300 <hi>l.</hi>
in Debt by these fore-mentioned Losses, <hi>(for I had no
reason to conceal 'em, having gain'd very considerably in
Trade till these happen'd)</hi> I also told her that with
my Wife's Portion I design'd to clear my own Estate,
whch I also did, and Joyntur'd my Wife therein.</p>
            <p>Sir, The <hi>Fortune</hi> that my Mother offer'd me down,
was <hi>a Thousand Pounds;</hi> but besides that, I insisted
on 500 <hi>l.</hi> more, to pay off my other Debts, and to
carry on my Trade: And who cou'd have thought
but I shou'd have obtain'd it, my Wife being the
only Child of her Mother? But having, as I said,
clear'd my <hi>Own Estate,</hi> (which is worth 2000 <hi>l.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the Two <hi>Reversions,</hi> which in time may be
1800 <hi>l.</hi> added to it) and Joyntur'd my Wife there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
I drew up the State of my Case, with respect to
my other Debts, and presented it to my Mother,
who (to my great amazement) was so far from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering
my desires, that she refus'd so much as to read
the Paper I drew up; which was a thing so very
Unkind <hi>(I was about to say Barbarous)</hi> that had a
<hi>Turk</hi> presented me his Case, I wou'd have Read it,
tho' I had never Answer'd it.</p>
            <p>When my hopes were thus frustrated with respect
to my Mother, I then told the matter to my <hi>Wife,</hi>
and desir'd her to tell her Mother of the Necessity I
was under of having 300 <hi>l.</hi> which she did; but at the
same time said, <hi>She'd Starve before she'd part with her
Ioynture,</hi> which yet I never ask'd her to do.—And
can you think now I have not Reason to absent my
self from my Home, since I cann't go thither with
Safety?</p>
            <p>You write me word indeed, <hi>That my Wife speaks
of me with very much Tenderness and Affection;</hi> which
I am very apt to believe, for she tells me in her last
Letter, <hi>Let Business succeed as it please, she does not
value that, so that she cou'd but see me at home;</hi> and
in the next line adds, <hi>I'm mightily concern'd for your
Illness, which is the same with mine; for you and I are
one.</hi> But whilst she expresses Unkindness in her Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and refuses to do what lies in her Power to
make me Easie, her words are but like those of
whom St. <hi>Iames</hi> speaks, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2. 16. who said, <hi>

my Coming Home, and Continuing there, when She's the
only Occasion of my Absence?</hi> For I do assure you,
Mr. <hi>Larkin,</hi> whatever my <hi>Mother</hi> and my <hi>Wife</hi> may
make you believe, That if my <hi>Mother</hi> will let me
take up 500 <hi>l.</hi> upon my <hi>Own Estate;</hi> or (which will
be a greater Kindness, and sooner done) lend me
200 <hi>l.</hi> and be bound her self for 300 <hi>l.</hi> more, that
so I may pay my Debts and be made Easie, (which
is all I ever desir'd) I will both immediately come
Home, and also continue there, and Absent my
self no more. But at present <hi>Cohabitation</hi> is no
ways proper; for I have such an Abhorrence of
any thing that looks Unjust, tho' 'twere but in the
least Trifle, that I think 'tis <hi>a Great Sin</hi> (if I am
mistaken, I ask Pardon) <hi>for any Man so much as to
Try for an Heir that might probably Dispossess any one
of a Iust Debt, tho' 'twere but of Two Farthings</hi>—But
being Ambitious to be a <hi>Father,</hi> if either my
<hi>Mother</hi> or <hi>Wife</hi> will contribute to my being so upon
<hi>Honourable Terms,</hi> I will believe and say as much of
the Reality of their Kindness, as I now do to the
contrary; and will esteem such a <hi>Reconciliation</hi> the
happiest day I ever yet met withal. But if they
will rather chuse to expose my Reputation <hi>(which
I have kept hitherto Vnblemish'd)</hi> than to comply
with those <hi>Reasonable Terms</hi> I have mention'd, it is
evident their Hearts and their Tongues don't go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
For the World knows well enough that my
Mother has a FAIR ESTATE, and that my Wife is
her only Child; and to whom upon our Marriage
she promis'd to leave it; which Promise was made
as a Motive <hi>to make Me consent to the Match:</hi> And
since upon that Promise I marry'd her Daughter,
and Joyntur'd her in a clear Estate of 2000 <hi>l.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the <hi>Reversions;</hi> that she shou'd now suffer my
Reputation to be slurr'd (as 'tis like to be) for want
of 300 <hi>l.</hi> is what I believe your Self cou'd never
have thought, had it not been told you.</p>
            <p>But I know well enough they have their OBJE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CTIONS,
with which they satisfie themselves, and
I shoul'd not deal fairly by them (as I always have,
and always will do) should I not inform you what
they are.</p>
            <p>They will say, <hi>That if they shou'd do this, there will
be no end of it; for I shall quickly run my self as far in
Debt again by Printing (being what I so much delight
in.)</hi> But to obviate this, I answer, That I desire
but 500 <hi>l.</hi> in all, of which I shall use 375 to clear
the Bonds, and what I owe in Trade, and then there
will be a <hi>well-furnish'd House, a clear Stock, a good
Estate in Land, and 125 l. in Money to Trade withal;</hi>
and that I may not be tempted to exceed those
Bounds, I have resolved never to exceed 50 <hi>l.</hi> at
once either in <hi>Printers</hi> or <hi>Stationers</hi> Debts. And if
by Trading I shall happen to run that out, I will
give over Trading, and live on what I have; which
in Conjunction with my MO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER's
PROMISE,<note n="d" place="margin">As I shall prove by the Letter that was sent to me by her Order.</note> is
more by 6000 <hi>l.</hi> than ever we
are likely to spend, having
neither <hi>Child nor Chick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They may also object, <hi>That
tho' I have Ioyntur'd my Wife in my Estate, yet I still
keep the Writings in my own hand, and will not let
them have them.</hi> To this I Answer, 'Tis true,
I do so; but the Reason is, Because whilst I see
they have no regard either to my <hi>Ease</hi> or <hi>Reputation,</hi>
by enabling me to pay my just Debts, I cann't look
upon 'em as my Friends, and upon that account
have kept my <hi>Writings</hi> from 'em <hi>[and they are now
in the hands of an Eminent Citizen.]</hi> But if they
will Answer my Expectation, with respect to the
Particulars above mention'd, I will, if my Mother
desires it, put all my <hi>Writings</hi> into her hands, which at
once takes off that <hi>Objection.</hi> Perhaps they'll also say,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That I have receiv'd Money from Ireland, for my Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
thither, that might have paid my Debts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their help.</hi> To this <hi>I</hi> Answer, The several Debts
<hi>I</hi> contracted for <hi>Paper</hi> and <hi>Printing</hi> since my second
Marriage—The Moneys which <hi>I</hi> paid that <hi>I</hi> took up
upon Bond, to furnish out my Venture for <hi>Ireland;</hi>
The Charges <hi>I</hi> was at in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for the King's Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms,
Binders, Printers, five Servants, and the Sale,
was about 440 <hi>l.</hi> The great quantity of Money <hi>I</hi>
lost in <hi>Ireland,</hi> through the Dishonesty of some <hi>I</hi>
trusted; The great Losses <hi>I</hi> have had in several Books
<hi>I</hi> have Printed since my Return for <hi>England;</hi> The
Sums <hi>I</hi> have paid for <hi>New Copies,</hi> of which Sir
<hi>William Temple</hi>'s <hi>Letters</hi> is one, and the <hi>Whole Duty
of Man in Verse,</hi> is another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Dear Friend,</hi> These several <hi>Payments</hi> and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments,</hi>
together with the vast Charges <hi>I</hi> have
been at, in defraying <hi>Two Fits of Sickness</hi> this Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
[for had <hi>I</hi> neglected my self, <hi>I</hi> had perish'd,
my <hi>Wife</hi> nor <hi>Mother</hi> never sending once to know if
<hi>I</hi> wanted any thing in my <hi>Two Sicknesses]</hi> have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gross'd
all the Moneys <hi>I</hi> receiv'd in <hi>Ireland,</hi> except
a small Sum remaining for my present Support; and
<hi>I</hi> cann't see, as <hi>I</hi> told my Wife, <hi>why these Disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments
shou'd Diminish her Love, for they Increase
mine.</hi>—However, 'Twas by Reason of these Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments,
that <hi>I</hi> never paid off the <hi>Bonds I</hi> had
told 'em of, nor gave 'em any Account of my <hi>Irish-Venture:</hi>
For seeing my <hi>Mother</hi> and <hi>Wife</hi> so unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
refus'd to Assist me, (chusing rather to venture
my Life on the <hi>Irish-Seas,</hi> tho' <hi>I</hi> was but newly
Marry'd) <hi>I</hi> thought they shew'd a very Selfish Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
so <hi>Industriously</hi> to enquire about what <hi>I</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
but no ways to concern themselves about
what I wanted: And, which adds to their Unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<hi>(if they don't permit me to do Iustice) I</hi> had
<hi>several Proposals</hi> made of a Thousand Pounds [with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

rejected for the sake of <hi>my Present Wife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shou'd <hi>I</hi> have any Debates with 'em upon this
Subject, it wou'd run us into <hi>New Quarrels,</hi> and
therefore I Resolve <hi>[for my own Quiet]</hi> to forget
all their Provocations; and sure I am, Ill Husbandry
<hi>[for Losses in Trade cann't be so Accounted]</hi> can be no
excuse for their being Unkind; perhaps a Drunken
Swearing Husband might have frighted 'em to
a Complyance; but I do averr, <hi>I</hi> was never disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
with Drinking in my whole Life; and Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
all the Servants that have liv'd with me, to
prove one single instance to the contrary:—Nay,
Mr. <hi>Larkin,</hi> I appeal even to you, whether ever
you saw any thing in all the time that you have
been acquainted with me [which is 20 years] that
look'd like <hi>Extravagance?</hi> Nay, I'm sure, you have
rather thought me <hi>too Covetous,</hi> but it was because
you knew not <hi>where the Shoo pinch'd me;</hi> and had I
not met with these <hi>Disappointments in Trade,</hi> I inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not to have troubled them: <hi>And yet why shou'd
this be thought such a Trouble?</hi> You know I was bound
for a <hi>Thousand Pound</hi> for my first Wive's Sisters
Husband [at my <hi>Wife</hi>'s desire] and forc'd to pay a
great part of it, and yet never lov'd my Wife the
worse, nor once upbraided her with it, as she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
upon her <hi>Death-Bed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Wife and Mother</hi> have now such an Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to oblige me as may never fall out again; but <hi>I</hi>
desire they'd remember that the 500 <hi>l. I</hi> am asking
for, is not Money <hi>Given,</hi> but only <hi>Lent Me,</hi> and
that upon my <hi>Own Estate,</hi> in which my Wife, <hi>[a
very sickly Woman]</hi> has no further Interest than her
<hi>bare Life:</hi> But tho my Dear has no more than her
Life in my Estate, yet her free and generous grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my present Request, will be so gratefully taken
by me, <hi>that</hi> I <hi>shall make it the Business of my whole
Life to study to Requite it.</hi>—I say, Provided it be
done Freely, and without Reflections. There is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a way of doing Kindnesses that takes away the
Kindness of the thing done; but when I see a <hi>Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is done Kindly,</hi> there's nothing can oblige me
more—Nor will the Kindness be more to me than
to my DEAR SPOUSE; for, <hi>a Wife shines by her
Husbands Honour, but must be darkened if he suffer an
Ecclipse.</hi>—If she believed this, she'd be forward to
grant my Request; but whether she does or no, I
look upon it an indispensible Duty to pay my Just
Debts, and cann't die with a good Conscience till it
be done; and wou'd no more have put my self out
of a Capacity of doing it, than I wou'd have <hi>Eaten
Fire,</hi> had I not thought I shou'd have had that
Money from my Mother which would have inabled
me to do it. And do you Judge whether I had not
Reason to think so, for when her Attorney, whom
I mentioned before, ask'd her before our Marriage
<hi>to lend me</hi> 300 l. <hi>she did not say she would not, which
made him tell me, he did not doubt but she wou'd lend
it.</hi> I say, looking upon the Payment of my just Debts,
as I do, to be an <hi>Indispensible Duty,</hi> if both my <hi>Wife
and Mother</hi> refuse to assist me in it, I must Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to raise it from my <hi>Estate</hi> by Cutting down the
Timber, there being <hi>several Acres of Wood</hi> upon it,
which being sold, I doubt not will raise me a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Sum. 'Tis true, I am very loth to do
this, because it will disgrace the Estate; but seeing
they first expose my Reputation, why should I be
solicitous about it? And I have no ways left to help
my self, but either this, or else the <hi>Selling the Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
of it after my Wives Life: And for my self, I
am no ways solicitous; for, I'<hi>d rather Beg, than not
pay my Debts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, and our Living from each other, will be the
unhappy Consequences of their Refusing to assist
me: When on the contrary, shou'd they comply
with my Desires, we might live happily together,
and the Estate kept Free and Undisfigured. Besides,
if Providence shou'd take me hence before her, I
<hi>shou'd think I cou'd not do better than to leave all to her,
who was willing to part with all to serve me, and make
me Easie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if they do not agree to these Terms, instead
of <hi>Marrying a Wife of a Fortune,</hi> [as many a man
has done, whose Estate is not worth so many Pence
as mine is worth Hundreds] I have fairly married
my own Ruine, and must have the <hi>Scandal of Owing
(I won't say Breaking for) 300 l.</hi> tho my own Estate
with the Reversions, is worth ten times more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
her MOTHERS PROMISE of giving me <hi>Sampsil,</hi>
(which is a Noble Estate it self) and the several
hundreds she Dyed Possess'd of, which I am so far
from desiring, that wou'd she but make me easie,
there's not a Person in the World wou'd more hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
desire her Life than my self. But the <hi>Whole Duty
of Man</hi> tells us, that <hi>A Promise is a Debt,</hi> and I thought
I might depend upon it, (and therefore refus'd a
Note she offer'd to secure <hi>Sampsil</hi> to me and my
Wife, in Case she Marry'd her self) when made to
influence <hi>such a Solemn thing, as a Marriage.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do I doubt, at her Death, the Performance of
the Marriage Promise, tho she shou'd think good,
<hi>to make me a Vagabond in the mean time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though at present I labour under the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
of being forc'd to ask a Favour at their hands
[I word it so, for were it in my Power, and I saw
them so pinch'd as I am, I shou'd voluntarily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
doing that which I am forc'd to intreat for, and
perhaps in vain.] Yet my Comfort is, the <hi>Printing
of this Letter</hi> will let the World (and my <hi>Few Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors)</hi>
see that <hi>I</hi> wou'd be Honest, if my <hi>Mother,</hi>
or <hi>Wife</hi> either, had so much Love for me as to let
me; and therefore all the Injuries others suffer by
<pb facs="tcp:59887:4"/>
me, will lie at their Doors; which will be
a greater <hi>Clog upon their Consciences than they'll be able
to bear;</hi> and therefore I hope they'll consider that
<hi>Covetousness</hi> [especially in a <hi>Husband</hi> or <hi>Wife]</hi> is a
more provoking Sin than is generally thought; for
how often have SMITHFIELD-BARGAINS been
made, to add Land to Land, not Love to Love;
and to <hi>unite Houses to Houses, not Hearts to Hearts;
which hath been the Occasion that Men have turn'd Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and Women Devils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have I fairly represented my <hi>Whole Case,</hi> with
respect to my <hi>Honoured Mother</hi> and my <hi>Dear Wife.</hi> I
shall not need to desire you to keep it <hi>private,</hi> having
told it as a <hi>Secret</hi> [unless you shall think it proper to
shew it to my <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Mother]</hi> for <hi>I</hi> would not it
should be made <hi>Publick</hi> whilst there remains any
hopes of an <hi>Accommodation;</hi> and therefore to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
your Faithfulness herein, wou'd look like a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
upon you; or rather upon my self, in <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
a Secret of this Importance to one that I
thought coudn't keep it.</hi> But I have no such thoughts,
only having been thus free with you, let me beg
your Advice herein.—I cannot think but with
<hi>Extream Trouble,</hi> of doing any thing that may Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<hi>my Dear Wife and Mother,</hi> whom [upon their
<hi>Compliance</hi> with my Just Desires] I <hi>cou'd Embrace in
the Arms of a Sincere and Vnfeigned Affection, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
all that has hitherto look'd like Vnkindness, in the
Grave of Eternal Oblivion.</hi> But since Self-Preservation
is the Great Fundamental Principle and Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
if they refuse to comply with me herein, and
go about through their <hi>inordinate Love of Money, to
Banish me from my own Home, and Expose my Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the World;</hi> I shall then be under a Necessity
of Exposing them to the World in their <hi>proper Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,</hi>
being furnish'd [as I hinted before] with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials
for that Purpose, but they shall never be
Publish'd, if I can but meet with that Compliance
from my Wife, which both the <hi>Law of God and
Man has made her Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>These things,</hi> I think to lay before my <hi>Wife and
her Mother,</hi> but wou'd willingly have your Thoughts

in Answer to one of his to me, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had read it [unknown to me] went
with it to my <hi>Wife and Mother;</hi> who
both refus'd to Comply with my just Desires, either
of Suffering me to take up 500 <hi>l.</hi> upon my own
Estate, or to lend me such a Sum <hi>out of her own heaps;</hi>
tho besides shewing my Letter, he us'd several Pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Arguments to incite them to it, but all in Vain.
On the <hi>9th Instant</hi> coming to <hi>London,</hi> I sent for Mr.
<hi>Larkin,</hi> who acquainted <hi>me,</hi> That [hoping to serve
<hi>me</hi> thereby] he had shew'd <hi>my</hi> Letter to <hi>my Mother</hi>
and <hi>Wife,</hi> and that they had heard it through, but
without any success; which he admired at, seeing,
as he express'd it, <hi>There were Arguments enough in
it, if not to melt a Stone, yet at least to carry a Cause
where a Wife, that was continually saying,</hi> She had been
Miserable had she Married any Man

And certainly unless they have seared

I conceal till I am further Provok'd they'll
one day think it their Duty to Answer my Reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

to forgive 'em, tho I find it the hardest Task o

Life; <hi>For by reason of their Covetousness, they

               </hi>
and what has cost me several <hi>Hundred Pounds,</hi>

            <p>So much for my <hi>Estate in Land.</hi>—As to my <hi>Stock,</hi>
she said she did not so much concern her self about
that, as my Land; and indeed I don't know why
she shou'd; for my Land (which her Friend declares
was what I related) <hi>was a sufficient Ioynture for her
Thousand Pound.</hi> However, as I had satisfy'd her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
my Land, so I was willing to give her the best
Account I cou'd of my <hi>Stock;</hi> and accordingly I told
her my Copies and Books I had Printed, had cost
me 2000 <hi>l.</hi> and if I added <hi>Three,</hi> 'twas no more
than was True, (<hi>I having Printed many Hundred
Books)</hi> But tho my Stock was thus Bulky, as is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
seen by <hi>my Irish-Venture,</hi> and the remaining
Stock which I left behind, yet withal I told her I
cou'd not say, if my Stock was forc'd to be Sold,
that it wou'd yield me 400 <hi>l.</hi> for in such Cases <hi>(as
was seen in the Fate of my Remaining Stock)</hi> Books sell
little more than for waste Paper. However, That
part of my Stock I sent to <hi>Dublin,</hi> yielded 400 <hi>l.</hi>
and a great deal more, as Mr. <hi>Larkin</hi> knows, that
was present at the Sale: <hi>So that my Land was as
much, and my Stock better, than I represented it.</hi>—But
I cann't help Losses and Disappointments in
Trade, and wou'd be easie under them; <hi>For not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <head>A Word to those Gentlemen to whom I'm Engag'd.</head>
            <p>I Shall next in a particular manner addresse my
self to those <hi>Gentlemen</hi> to whom I'm Oblig'd, and
upon whose Patience <hi>(by reason of a Covetous Mother
and Vnkind Wife)</hi> I am forc't to Trespass a little,
which, Next to the Unkindness of my Wife, is the
only thing in the World that Troubles me.—I have
ever had a great Aversion to be in Debt, in small as
well as in greater matters; and for that reason have
often paid a Debt twice over, for fear I had not paid
it once; but that which I so much dreaded, is now
come upon me; For tho I respect my <hi>Wife and
Mother</hi> as much, or, were it possible, <hi>more than they
love the World,</hi> yet you see, Gentlemen, by my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to Mr. <hi>Larkin,</hi> that their Caresses before Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
are all forgot, and that the Tears of a Husband
have no <hi>Rhetorick</hi> in 'em, where Money is the thing
desir'd.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, they have a FAIR ESTATE, but ha'nt
the Soul to do good with it either to themselves or
others. But 'tis no more than what <hi>Solomrn</hi> tells
us, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5. 13, 14. <hi>There is</hi> (says he) <hi>a sore Evi.
which I have seen under the Sun, namely, Riches kept
for the Owners thereof to their hurt—But those Riches
perish by Evil Travel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For my own part, I can truly say, I have found
more Pleasure in dividing a small Fortune with my
Friends, than in Hoarding up, or Enjoying the
greatest Treasures without them. The greatest Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
that we can receive from Riches, is, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling
us in our <hi>LIFE TIME</hi> to do more good than
those that have less; and therefore as <hi>I</hi> never wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for DEAD-MENS-SHOES,
<note n="f" place="margin">
                  <hi>As I have prov'd in</hi> An Essay upon dead-Mens-Shoes, <hi>

Sneaking; or at least so kind as
not to starve himself. I cann't

themselves, <hi>(for I found 'em alive when I came home)</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:59887:5"/>
and to do 'em Justice, <hi>They Never Fight;</hi> but 'tis
evident by my Mothers denying my small Request,
that <hi>she loves nothing but her Money:</hi> Her <hi>FIRST
SON-IN-LAW</hi> (a Person of Great Worth) found her
of this Temper <hi>(to his Great Disappointment)</hi> and I
cou'd say something of HER CARRIAGE TO HER
HUSBAND, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But here's enough to convince the
world (more especially my Neighbours in <hi>Iewen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>street)</hi>
how falsly she represented my <hi>Last Farewel;</hi>
and her Barbarous Treatment appears in nothing so
much, as in her <hi>aggravating those Heats</hi> at parting,
of which (as I can prove by several Witnesses)
<hi>She and her Daughter were the Sole Occasion.</hi> It cou'd
not satisfie e'm to be the Cause of my Ruine, <hi>(for
is'nt it plain, when they cou'd so easily Prevent it, and
wou'd not?)</hi> but they must afterwards <hi>murther my
Reputation.</hi> This is such a Barbarous thing for a
Wife to be guilty of, that I never heard any thing
like it.—And it appears yet the more unkind, as I'm
told yesterday of a young Lady that (of her own
accord) sold her <hi>Iewels, Watch, Rings,</hi> (instead of
Raving that her Husband had got 'em) to pay off
his Just Debts. But tho I have nothing to boast of,
of this kind, yet my comfort is, ALL I owe in the
World, is now brought into the Narrow Compass
of 250 <hi>l.</hi> For being obliged in Conscience to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
to a near Relation 150 <hi>l.</hi> (as 'twas the greatest
part of her Maintenance) I have by the said Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
paid all I owe, to the Sum of 250 <hi>l.</hi> and that's
owing to Persons that are so far from blaming what
<hi>I</hi> ve done, that they are amaz'd <hi>(as every body was
that knew 'em)</hi> how I cou'd live with 'em so long.
Three of these Persons have sent me word that they
are so well satisfyed of my Honest Intentions, that
they'l never Touch a Hair of my Head; <hi>and I don't
doubt but I shall meet with the like Compassion from all
the rest.</hi> 'Tis not long since I told a Person, that
sued to me for Pity, that I'd Sign his Liberty
with as <hi>many Hands</hi> (if I had 'em) <hi>as I have Hairs on
my Head.</hi> Gent. I don't doubt but my Readiness to
Serve others in their Distress, has been the occasion
of that Generous Treatment I receive from you.
However I do assure you, that the good Opinion
you have of me, shall not be lost; for that I may
do you Justice, I am willing to sell <hi>even mySelf (to
the very Skin) to Pay you:</hi> 'Tis true, the Sum is so
very Little, I owe now, that I'm asham'd to think
that my <hi>Wife and Mother</hi> shou'd have such a <hi>Mean
Spirit</hi> as to suffer me to be Expos'd for it: But Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
I ever thought there was as much <hi>Iustice

(in the year 1700,) I'll clear all the Interest
that shall then be due; and if Gods Providence does
not work my Deliverance before that, (for if I Dye

they'll pay the 250 <hi>l.</hi> or if they don't, by the <hi>Lady-Day</hi>

the Income of my Estate, by Equal Divisions, <hi>has

the only Instance in this Age, <hi>that has starv'd in the

                  <head>My Letter to my WIFE.</head>
                  <opener>MY DEAR!</opener>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Came to Town last Night, and sent for my Friend
Mr. <hi>Larkin</hi> about Ten at Night; who told me he
had been with you and my Mother, and had shew'd
you my Letter to him, wherein I gave him <hi>a true
state of my Case;</hi> and tho' it was what I did not
design he shou'd have done, yet having done it, he has
thereby sav'd me the Labour, and can justifie to the World,
That my Mother has Refus'd to lend me any <hi>Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>
to Enable me to be honest, or to make me Easie;
and that she Values me, and you so little, that rather
than let me take up 500 <hi>l.</hi> upon my Own Estate, or lend
me so much of hers, she will suffer my Reputation, and
yours too <hi>(for to use your own Words, You and I
are One)</hi> to be Expos'd to the World; which when once
done, is a Dammage she'll scarce be able to repair:
However I can Iustifie my self in all that I have done;
and resolve <hi>to be as honest as I can, till I can be so
honest as I wou'd:</hi> In order to which I will Print my
<hi>CASE</hi> with all convenient speed, and let the World see
that all those Allegations under which she wou'd cover
her self, are but like so many Cobwebs, which the Beesom
of Truth will quickly sweep away: And I am sorry that
in this Vnkindness of my Mother, you shou'd take part
with her against me, that is, <hi>against your self;</hi> For a
Husband ought to be nearer and dearer than a Mother;
and had you esteem'd me so, and dealt as such by me,
I had had no need to trouble my Mother: As to what
you make your Excuse, That then your Mother would
have given you nothing, if you can believe she wou'd
have been so UNNATURAL, yet it can be no Excuse,
except such a one as the Apostle Condemns, which is a
<hi>doing Evil that Good may come of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, <hi>Prethee,</hi> my Dear, Let my Mother Act as she
pleases, let not thee and <hi>I</hi> (who are both extraordinary
Crazy, and can live but a few Years) make such a
<hi>poor use of the World as to Hugg and Embrace it.</hi>
Besides, if you don't Consent to the making me easie,
how can I think your Love is what you pretend? Your
shewing so much Love to the World, is neither pleasing to
God nor Man; and consider <hi>(for you pretend to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion)</hi>
how twill rejoyce our Enemies, to see us Quarrel
with our very Blessings, and to make even Happiness it
self to Disappoint us.—You know, my Dear, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>C</hi>—y Sold her Estate un-aks'd, to <hi>oblige her
Spouse;</hi> and indeed the Design of Ioyntures is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
against <hi>bad Husbands,</hi> and not to Ruin those that
are kind, and wou'd be honest, if their Wives wou'd let
'em. I knew a Wife that wou'd often say, <hi>What does
a Joynture signifie to a Woman that loves her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band?</hi>
When Man and Wife love so little, that the one
is unconcerned in the others Afflictions, there generally
follows a Blast upon all they undertake.</p>
                  <p>My Dear, All our Distresses of Body and Mind shou'd
be so <hi>Equally Divided,</hi>
                     <note n="h" place="margin">As <hi>I</hi> have large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved in my <hi>Essay on knowing our Friends in Heaven.</hi>

all yours shou'd be mine, and all
mine shou'd be yours: Mr. <hi>Roch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
Marry'd us <hi>for better for
worse, for Richer for Poorer;</hi>
and [as you well observe] <hi>We
are One Flesh;</hi> and therefore shou'd be no more offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with the <hi>Words, or Failings and Wants of</hi> each
other, than we wou'd be had they been our own. For my
own share, I solemnly declare, Were you seiz'd with a
Fit of Sickness that requir'd the Advice of the <hi>whole
Colledge of Physicians,</hi> and all the Physick in the
Apothecaries Shops, I'd sell my Estate to procure it.
And why shou'd you doubt it? For did I not spend near

I cann't imagine what your Mother means by the mighty

for your Admittance to my Copyhold-Land, 'twas no Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice

                  </p>
                  <p>All that I shall add, is, That you must not blame me

cou'd stay no longer: So I took my leave (for that
Night) in the following words:</p>
            <p>Mother, 'Tis now but a few hours before my Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will be Slurr'd; which seeing neither you nor my
Wise will prevent, I have only to add, I pray God bless
you Both; and so (with thanking you for my Ruine)
bid you Farwel; not doubting but the GOD of my Life,
who knows the Sincerity of my Heart, and Designs, to pay
my Debts, and in all things to keep a Conscience void of
offence towards GOD and Man, will notwithstanding
all your Vnkindness, inable me to accomplish what I so
earnestly desire.</p>
            <p>After uttering these Words, to shew I was in
Charity with them, I Saluted 'em both, and gave
'em a <hi>Second Farwel;</hi> and at parting I told my Mother
the Story of <hi>Midas,</hi> who (as the Poets feign) <hi>starv'd
in the midst of Plenty: And so Mother</hi> (said I) <hi>do you
deal with me.</hi> And with those words, I took leave
of both Wife and Mother; and then bid Farwel to
the <hi>Black Raven,</hi> the most Pleasant House that I
ever dwelt in.</p>
            <p>I know some that can creep for Interest, will
blame me for Publishing This CASE; Say they,
<hi>Who wou'd lose such a Fair Estate at the Mannor of</hi>
Sampsil, <hi>for want of a little Submission?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I answer, <hi>A Man may bear till his heart
breaks;</hi> and having us'd all the gentle Methods I cou'd
think of, to no purpose, the <hi>Publishing of This Case</hi>
is the only way <hi>I</hi> have left to Reform 'em. Besides,
I think it my Duty to prefer a Quiet Life, and the
doing of Justice, to the <hi>Fine Mannor of Sampsil;</hi> for
I can be happy without <hi>Sampsil,</hi> but I shou'd never
be so, shou'd I prove dishonest.—But say I had a
Mind to <hi>Sampsil,</hi> I'm sure to Publish this Case, is the
only way to insure it; for when my Mother reads it,
(wherein I have conceal'd abundance of things rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to her) she'll find that <hi>Sampsil,</hi> and her <hi>Vseless
Heaps,</hi> won't be able to repair that Damage <hi>I</hi> now
suffer by her <hi>Matchless Cruelty.</hi>—Besides, I've prov'd
already, that <hi>A PROMISE IS A DEBT,</hi> and she
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59887:7"/>
having promis'd me <hi>Sampsil,</hi> in a solemn manner, I
cann't see how she shou'd dye with <hi>a Safe Conscience,</hi>

               </gap> of <hi>Sampsil,(and for the Houses at St.</hi> Albans,
<hi>they were given to my Wife after her Mothers Death</hi>)
who knows she may with as much reason make bold
with a Disgust to Protest paying a due Debt, to any
Person that does not humour or please her, as not
perform an Absolute Promise; and Conscience must
needs tell them so that make it. <hi>'Tis very Ridiculous,
after a Promise is past, to bring in Conditions.</hi> I might be
Endless upon this Subject; but, as <hi>Cowley</hi> says, I am
almost choak'd with the Super-abundance of the
matter: Too much Plenty impoverishes me, as it
does them. <hi>So</hi> that <hi>I</hi> have the same Reasons, or
greater, to expect <hi>Sampsil,</hi> as ever I had. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whoever blames me for Publishing of This Case,
I shan't think 'em my Friends.</p>
            <p>I shall only add, There's not a Line in this <hi>CASE</hi>
but what I'll prove, and assert with my <hi>Last Breath;</hi>
and therefore if my <hi>Mother</hi> or <hi>Wife</hi> think good to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to it, they cann't do't in a better time; for they
have <hi>Banish'd me from my House and Home,</hi> and where
<hi>I Sojourn,</hi> I have nothing else to do but to Answer
them; but let me have the <hi>BEST CAVSE</hi> in the
World, <hi>I</hi> must expect that men of a Narrow Soul
will be raising of Lyes, and that <hi>my Enemies will
triumph over me.</hi> But I bless GOD, <hi>Ill Husband<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

            <p>THE Obligingness of Your Temper, and
your being a <hi>Peace-Maker,</hi> not only by
your Office, as a Minister, but by your <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Inclination;</hi> which, together with the good
Opinion my <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Mother</hi> (as well as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
body else) has of you, has prevail'd with me
to desire that Favour of you, as to see if it be
possible to bring 'em to a <hi>Sense of their Duty,</hi>
and to a Compliance with my <hi>Reasonable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands:</hi>
In order to which, I wou'd desire you to
read my <hi>Case</hi> to 'em, which I have here sent
you in Print, and which will be Publish'd to
Morrow. But if upon hearing it, they are
willing to grant my Request, I do hereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
to you, That upon such an Assurance, I
will yet <hi>Suppress this Paper,</hi> tho Printed,
and will <hi>Burn the Impression.</hi> For even
<hi>Matrimonial Quarrels,</hi> provided they are
heartily Forgiven, make the Marry'd Couple
but love better: <hi>The Falling out of Lovers</hi>
(and such Married Folks are, or shou'd be) is
not only the <hi>Renewer;</hi> but <hi>Increaser of Love.</hi>
Or if any angry Words shou'd here after arise,
I'm for following your Advice, to let 'em no
more take <hi>Air, than Fire in a Cellar;</hi> I'd
not have 'em told so much as to her Mother,
but let the <hi>Pillow</hi> alone decide 'em. And if
we'd yet be happy, 'tis my Advice (so my
Self, as well as to my Wife) That we're never
Angry together: <hi>For if only one is Angry,
'tis the Easier to Agree—</hi> However, in
This Case, I desire we may both learn the
<hi>Art of Memory,</hi> and the greater <hi>Art of
Forgetfulness,</hi> and we shall not fail of being
Happy still; that is, <hi>Remember</hi> all the <hi>kind</hi>
things, <hi>Forget</hi> all that's <hi>harsh</hi> or <hi>ungrateful;</hi>
at least never Repeat 'em, which will be the
best way to Forget 'em.</p>
            <p>But if they still <hi>continue Obdurate</hi> to all Advances
I have made towards a Comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Living with my <hi>Dear Wife,</hi> I am satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
that I have done my Duty, and that the
Fault will lie at their Doors. And this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to your self will be a further Testimony
against' em. Which is all, at present, from
Reverend Sir,</p>
