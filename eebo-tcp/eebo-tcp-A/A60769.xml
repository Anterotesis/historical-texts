            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE favourable Reception with the
Publick, that the Inscription of your
Name has procured to my Letter
about Coin, incourages me to make use of the
same Artifice in this second Attempt, which
common Fame tells me is yet Necessary. It
seems that notwithstanding all you have
said, and which I have but briefly hinted
at, there are some Men who artfully carry
on the Design of having our Coin rais'd (as
they call it) the next Session of Parliament;
And others that are too weakly drawn to a
Concurrence in it. 'Tis strange. For if
there be any one Truth in what I have writ,
(if Two and Two make Four) I cannot see
but both the Absurdity and Iniquity of that
Design are as evident as the Sun at Noon
Day. But however, since there is yet some
appearance of a little remaining Doubt, I
beseech you, Sir, give me leave once more
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51076:4"/>
to shelter my self under the shadow of your
Name, whilst I propose to all Men, a little
more fully, my thoughts upon that Subject.</p>
            <p>Methinks there should not need many
words upon it. For the whole Matter seems
to me to divide it self naturally into two
(and but two) Branches: First, An Enquiry
into the meaning of the thing: And then
the Consequences of it. In which, I am
perswaded, a regular Progression will make
all plain and easie.</p>
            <p>What can be the meaning of <hi>raising of
Coin?</hi> It would indeed be a real raising of it,
if (preserving its old name and fineness) some
proportional Degree of Weight were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to every individual Piece. Then every
Piece would be properly raised: It would
be increased in Worth: And without any
Law, it would quickly be esteemed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
by all Mankind, both at home and
abroad. But this is by no means the thing
intended. This, these Projectors will be apt
to say, would be a present extravagant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
of the Nation's Treasure. And they
are in the right. For, tho' after a very little
while, when every one came to know the
true value of the Money that he had, he
would in all his Bargains expect proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Penny-worths; Yet at the first, the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51076:4"/>
Nation would infallibly lose all that addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
weight, in the Summs that it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
(at the time of such a change) to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
to Foreigners. And this I know no
body either generous enough, or foolish e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to propose. Yet this (this making
of Pieces of the same Denomination to be
either more weighty or more fine than they
were before) is the only possible way in
Nature of doing what can properly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Raising of Coin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But since this is not the Case, since Use
<hi>(Quem penes Arbitrium est &amp; Ius &amp; Norma
loquendi)</hi> has established another Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Term; let us talk improperly
with our Neighbours. Raising of Coin,
say those that have their Chests full of it,
can be understood by no Man of common
sense otherwise than of the raising the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of it, by a Law, without altering any
thing either in its weight or fineness. This
their Sense (which lies wonderfully quick
in their Fingers Ends) tells them would be
very advantageous to themselves: And they
laugh at our Criticisms. Now this is as
much as to say, in plain English; Either
clip a Shilling to the weight of Sixpence,
and let that diminish'd Piece go for a Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
still, as it did a Year ago; Or let our
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51076:5"/>
curious new Mill'd Six-pences pass for Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
and other Pieces in the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.
Either way the Coin is raised:
For every Man that has Money will be just
twice as Rich as he was before: And by
consequence the whole Nation will be so
too. I doubt I have put this supposition,
of Doubling all, a little too grosly. They
are not so unreasonable: But a quarter part
Advance, Three-pence in the Shilling, may
be very convenient. That Conveniency I
shall examine by and by. At present I look
no further than to agree with them about
the meaning of the thing.</p>
            <p>This then is the signification of raising
of Coin, in our Modern Dialect. 'Tis some
way or other an altering the present esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd
Measure between the Weight and
the Name of every individual Piece. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Eight Drams now make an Ounce, and
one Ounce (I suppose the round Summ,
tho' not exact, only for clearness) makes
a Crown; The raising of a Crown is, to
call four Drams (the Half-Crown) by the
Name of the Whole; and other Pieces in
the same proportion. However I turn my
thoughts upon this Matter, I can find no
more in it; Nay, I beg leave to say posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
there is no more in this great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51076:5"/>
of raising of Coin, than merely the
change of a few Names, at first given Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarily
to certain Pieces of Metal of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
weight and fineness, And since conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
so, for the ascertaining of legal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts,
and the general Convenience of
Commerce.</p>
            <p>I suppose we are agreed in this Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
'Tis a Change in the Name only, and
not in the thing. For a change in the thing,
the addition of more weight to a Piece of
the same Name and same Purity, every body
sees is prejudicial. Whereas the Deduction
of any Proportion of weight from such a
Piece does seem to some, or at least is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be, so far as it reaches, advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous.</p>
            <p>Let it be so then. To overcome all the
Pecuniary Difficulties that this Nation
now labours under, we are to raise our
Coin: That is, we are to give new Names
to the same proportional Pieces of Metal.
A Half is to be called a Whole, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If this
will do the Business, 'tis an excellent
Knack: And 'tis pity an Hour should be
lost in delaying the Execution of it.
But let us now enquire a little into that
pretended Consequence of this Glorious
Project.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:51076:6"/>
This is the Second Branch into which I
said the Matter divides it self. It will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a larger Examination than he first.
But before I enter upon the particular Heads
of that Enquiry, methinks it would not
be amiss to consider what Effect an arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Change in the settled Names of any other
things would produce, as well as in Coin.
Let me beg Liberty to suppose an Assembly
of the <hi>Wise Men</hi> in the Country of <hi>Gotham:</hi>
For I dare not make so absurd a Supposition
in any other place. These Grave Senators
finding, that, by the Licentiousness of the
times, the Practice of Adultery was grown
so rife amongst them that they could not
preserve the Matrimonial Chastity of their
Wives; And having long endeavoured ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
to reform this Evil by the Severity of
Laws; At last one of them, whose Musical
Ear fansied something more harmonious in
the Sound of the Word, <hi>Gallant,</hi> than in the
Word, <hi>Husband,</hi> proposed that they should
change the Terms, and (by a legal Fixa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the pleasing Sound, <hi>Gallant,</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and of the harsh Sound, <hi>Husband,</hi>
to those lewd Debauchees that offended
them) try to regain their Wives Affection,
and reform their Practice. The Proposition
seemed easie; And therefore these <hi>Wise
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51076:6"/>
Men,</hi> to free themselves from a troublesome
Deliberation, enacted it accordingly. But
every one sees, however the Terms might
be changed, the Nature of the things (in
this Supposition) remained yet the same:
And that notwithstanding this Law, the
Person that was agreeable to the Wife be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
would be so still; And he that was
disagreeable would be despised.</p>
            <p>Perhaps this Supposition, to some Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
may appear rather Nauseous than Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant.
I am sensible of it. But I desire them
to consider whether there be any thing more
grave and solid, or whether there can be any
thing more useful, in changing the Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Word, <hi>Half,</hi> into the Sense that we
now understand by the Word, <hi>Whole;</hi> (Which
is the Proposition of those that labour to
promote the Project of heightning our Coin)
than there is in the supposed Decree of the
<hi>Wise Men of Gotham.</hi> Something more
mischievous indeed there may be: But more
useful there cannot. For a Law can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
make a disagreeable Husband to be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
lov'd, nor a Half to be really the whole.
But those Mischiefs (in our Case) I shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
more particularly by and by. Here I
only note, that upon both these changes of
Names, a Confusion in Speech would imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51076:7"/>
follow: But no manner of Benefit.</p>
            <p>And that I may now draw nearer to my
Matter; Let us suppose, in the next place,
that some other People, a Degree wiser than
our selves, should advance this Project of
ours a Degree further. Observing that,
whereas we have formerly called an Ounce of
Silver a Crown, we have now learnt the way
of doubling our Wealth, by calling half an
Ounce by that Name; They thereupon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to the same Practice in all other things.
And to do it at once effectually, without ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves to this or the other particular
Commodity, they enact in general, that
henceforwards Half an Ounce or Four
Drams shall be called an Ounce, and Half a
Yard or Eighteen Inches shall be called a
Yard. Thus they double not only their
Coin, but all the Merchantable Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
in their Country, all together. But
would these Wise Men, any more than those
of <hi>Gotham,</hi> find any manner of Advantage
by this Chimera? Every Body sees, in
this Case also, that nothing but Confusion
could follow.</p>
            <p>And will any Body now say that there is
any other Difference, between the height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of our Coin alone, and the heightning
of all other things; Or between the height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51076:7"/>
of our Coin a Fourth, a Fifth, or a
Sixth Part, and the heightning of it a Half;
than only the Difference between the less
and the more? Whatever Evil there is in the
largest of their Suppositions, will evidently
hold its Proportion in the least. Nay rather,
I may confidently affirm that by how much
wider the Change is, it will be so much the
more easily perceived, and the Mischiefs at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
it, tho' great, yet so much the
shorter. And on the contrary, how much
less perceptible the Change is in this Rise of
Coin, it will be apt to produce, if not so
great, I am sure so much more lasting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences.</p>
            <p>I will now insist no longer upon Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals;
But come directly to the Subject of
my present Deliberation; Which is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into the Consequences of the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of heightning our Coin. The Noise
of the pretended Advantageous Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
attending it is so great, that one would
think there were a great many of them. Yet
now that I reflect seriously upon it, I can
find but this single one, that carries with it
any manner of Appearance of the least Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to the Nation: Which is, That it
would be a means to draw our National
Treasure out of the private Hoards where
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51076:8"/>
it lies now useless to the Publick; And so
procure us a greater Plenty of Current <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi>
for the carrying on of our Commerce
and all other currant Occasions. What So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity
there is in that Pretence of publick
Advantage will best appear upon a View of
the whole. And therefore, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
any previous Judgment, I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the Heads that shall occurr to my
Thoughts, indifferently, whether they are,
or to whomsoever they are, either for the
better or for the worse. My general To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pics
are, Justice or Injustice: Advantage
or Disadvantage: And to whom. Yet I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
not to treat the Matter under those di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Heads, but to remark any or all of
them, as Occasion shall require.</p>
            <p>That the heightning of our Coin, as is
proposed, would be one Occasion of disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
some few more <hi>Species</hi> amongst us, for
common Use, I readily grant. The taking
away the Expectation of it, would indeed
do the same thing, and much more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.
But however, it must be owned, that
by this Method of raising our Coin, all Men
that have hoarded Treasures, not their own,
(when they found that by paying out Coin
raised one Half, or one Quarter, they could
gain such a proportion upon the whole
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51076:8"/>
Summ of the Debts that they owe) would
without all Doubt, readily issue out so much
of those Treasures as would serve to that
End. That is, they would pay, Or rather
(under the colour of a Law) compound for
their Debts, at 25 or 50 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Profit to
themselves, and Loss to their Creditors; as
the Proportion of this heightning of Coin
might be regulated. Whether they would
issue out one Farthing more; Whether they
would afford the Publick the Use of any
thing that is properly their own; Depends
upon quite different Considerations. They
will certainly never do it, but at the most
exorbitant Interest that they can possibly
procure: And whilst they have any ground
to think that the locking up of their Coffers
may be a means to heighten the Price of
Money, they will temporize, and issue out
their Treasures so sparingly, as to continue,
and (if possible) increase our Difficulties.</p>
            <p>If our Manners, our Laws, our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
be so desperately depraved that there
is no means left of making those that are
the most Opulent, and best able, pay their
just Debts, but by the allowance of so great
an Injustice, the Case is sad. I hope our
Senators, at their approaching Meeting,
will find other Means to invigorate the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51076:9"/>
of our Constitution. Nothing is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
in <hi>England</hi> to a Parliament. If the
Laws already made extend not regularly to
the Punishment of such gross Villainy, our
Senate may (if they see cause) make new
ones. But whatever Provision they make
for the Future, methinks they should not
suffer this by-past Iniquity, so heinous
and unparallel'd in all the Circumstances of
it, to pass without some severe Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
A perpetual Brand of Infamy is the
least Degree of Punishment that it deserves:
On the Person, I mean, as well as the thing.
Where-ever the Guilt is found notorious,
God forbid that the Guilty should be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to shelter themselves under any whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Pretence of Place or Privilege. Nay
the greater any such Pretence is, the more
exemplary ought to be the Animadversion.
Privilege to defraud our Neighbours! Who
can bear it? O, that I could see a little of
this invigorating Power break out amongst
us! Then I would hope for some Effectual
Reformation in every part of our corrupted
Body. Then, at least, I am assured there
would be no need of heightning our Coin,
for an Inducement to make Men pay their
Debts. <hi>A Vigorous and Rigorous</hi> Honesty in
the Executors of all Publick Offices, tho'
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51076:9"/>
it did not punish, yet it would so discoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
such fordid Practices, as would be
sufficient to stifle them. Nay, if we had
but here and there a little of this honest Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
intermixed with our natural Stupidity
(shall I call it so, or Depravity?) That little
would not fail by degrees to diffuse it-self,
and make us happy. You see, Sir, my Zeal
has here transported me. But however, I
will now conclude it, in heartily beseeching
Almighty God to grant us this inestimable
Blessing: This, I mean, particularly, of a
Reformation of Manners.</p>
            <p>For all this Zeal, I have not yet forgot
the Subject that I have in hand. The
heightning of Coin, I have granted, would
oblige some Men to pay their Debts, who
are not otherwise much disposed to do it;
And by Consequence would furnish the
Publick with so much Currant Cash. I
have pointed nevertheless at another way,
which (in my opinion) would do it much
better. But admit no other way could be
found, in this Conjuncture; And that we
were now to deliberate what is fit to be
done upon it: Truly Sir, I that write now
for no other End but my Country's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and who have nothing to guide my
Thoughts but the natural Consequences of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51076:10"/>
things, as they follow one upon another;
I say, if I were asked my Advice upon the
Case thus stated, I would propose that those
who desire such an Advantage should have
it: But upon condition then, that they should
set down their Names &amp; their Summs. And so
the Preamble of the Act (without any Sham)
should express the true Ground upon which
such and such things are so enacted. As
for Example; Suppose it were express'd, That
<hi>Whereas it is notorious that the present
Wealth of this Kingdom, in Lawful Gold
and Silver Coin, is abundantly more than
sufficient for our Currant occasions of
Commerce, Markets, and Expences; yet
nevertheless by the Locking up of those
Treasures in private Hoards, our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
is clog'd, our Markets are stopt,
and the whole Body of the Nation is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
straitned in the Course of their
Ordinary Affairs; Be it therefore ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>for the Encouragement of those
that shall in this Conjuncture contribute
to the Publick Ease, by the Payment of
their just Debts, in Lawful Money of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<hi>That an allowance be made unto them
in manner and form following, That is
to say, that</hi> A. B. <hi>for the Summ of</hi> 1000 l.
<hi>in which he stands indebted to</hi> C. D. <hi>shall
upon Payment of</hi> 500 (or of 750 l. as you
please to suppose it) <hi>be intirely discharged
from the said Debt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:51076:10"/>
               <hi>Item,</hi> For the Summ of 2000 <hi>l.</hi> in which
he stands indebted to <hi>E F, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so on, with the rest of his Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:
And at the Foot of his Account, let
the Summ Total be added up, amounting
to perhaps 100000 <hi>l.</hi> for which he is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to pay but 50 (or 75000 <hi>l.</hi> and in
consideration of that Service (such as it is)
to the Publick, his several Creditors are
obliged to allow him 50 suppose (or
25000 <hi>l.</hi>)</p>
            <p>After him, let others follow, with their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Beadroles: One amounting to 50000 <hi>l.</hi>
Another to 150000 <hi>l.</hi> and so on.</p>
            <p>Let those, I say, that desire this Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
fairly set down but their Names and
their Summs, that the Nation may know
what Obligation it has to each of them in
particular; And then, with my Consent,
let them have it. But if any Man be a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to have his Name recorded as a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender
to this Advantage, I think he ought
much more be ashamed to argue for a
general Allowance of so shameful a thing.
What! He would have a hardship put
upon the whole Nation, only for a Veil to
his own Practice! 'Tis hardly conceivable:
But I doubt it is too true. The Allowance
to be made in this manner to some Men,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51076:11"/>
if they would so accept of it, for certain
limited Summs, might possibly be set in
some proportional degree of Comparison
(how small soever) in balance with the
Conveniency that the whole Nation would
receive by the Cash which they should
produce. But the Difference between that
Conveniency, and the Consequences, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they are, that would arise from a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Law for the absolute heightning of
our Coin, in the manner proposed, is too
vastly wide to admit of any Comparison;
At least, without a very particular Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
            <p>I proceed therefore. The heightning
of Coin in this manner would spread just
so much Money amongst the People as the
Summ of these Hoarders Debts amounts
to: (A Considerable one I doubt not) But
not one Farthing more. It would inrich
them, by a manifest injustice, in the Ruin
of their Creditors: These perhaps worthy
Men, that wish well to their Country;
Those the Blood-suckers of the Nation,
that have nourished themselves at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of our Vitals. This Consequence I
think is very clear from all that I have
yet said both in this Letter and my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
<hi>viz.</hi> That Coin however raised in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51076:11"/>
Denomination, can be of no more real
Value than the weight of the pure Metal
that it contains. Whatever proportion it
is raised in, any other way, is just so far
an absolute Fraud put upon all the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
in the whole Kingdom.</p>
            <p>This Consideration opens to us a much
wider Prospect than that of those few
Persons whose Coffers we have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to unlock. For them, I have
allow'd an Excuse, tho' a bad one: Or
an Expedient, I should rather call it, if
they will please to make use of it. But for
giving such an Extravagant Advantage to
all the Debtors in <hi>England,</hi> without any
Merit at all in them towards the Publick,
is unsufferable. The thing is evident. If
half an Ounce, or three quarters of an Ounce,
of Silver should by Law by made to pass
for a Crown of Lawful Money of <hi>England;</hi>
Then in the Payment of all Debts for Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains,
Bonds, Mortgages, Rents, or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
else they may arise, the Debtor would
gain and the Creditor would lose the half
or the quarter that is deducted from the
ancient Standard. Can this be born? Is
the Interest of ill Men so strong, that we
have any great Reason to apprehend it?
However confidently they talk, I would
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51076:12"/>
yet hope better things. This House of
Commons, I am sure, consists of a great
many worthy Men, who are also Men of
considerable Bulk and Fortune in their
Country. Surely the Indigent, (I should
rather say the Rich) Debtors in that As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,
are neither so numerous as to
carry this against them, nor so artful as
to draw them in to vote it against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
I have said here the <hi>Rich Debtors;</hi>
Because (in truth) 'tis only they, (those
that have Cash lying ready by them, but
will not pay it because of their Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this very Advantage) that can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any Benefit at all by the proposed
Alteration of our Coin. The Indigent,
that have not such superfluous Cash lying
by them when this Alteration happens to
be made, however they find Money af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
will be obliged to receive it with
one Hand in the same manner as they pay
it with the other. So that they will have
no manner of Profit by the matter. But
nevertheless the Rich Creditor will on all
all hands certainly lose.</p>
            <p>I know not whether this need any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation.
But I beg pardon of you, Sir,
and of the Publick, if I am more afraid
of Obscurity than of Tediousness: And if
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51076:12"/>
I hazard therefore upon so important a
point to offend rather in Length than in
Brevity. My Thoughts are these. When
the Alteration in Coin is once made, in
the very same moment an Alteration in
the real Value of every other thing goes
along with it. Not that any thing, for
that reason, will be worth more Ounces
of Silver than it was before: But by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
to be worth just the same Number
of Ounces of Silver that it was before, it
will be worth more Shillings or Crowns;
proportionably as those pieces shall be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
diminisht in Weight, or raised in Name.
Now this Alteration in those things, if the
Alteration in Coin be great, will quickly
be perceived by every one: If it be small,
it will be the less perceptible; But then
the Consequences of it will be so much
the more lasting. Now the Wealthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
that receives in his Debts in this
rais'd Coin, if he have occasion to pay
it away the same moment for the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of another Debt, neither gets in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
nor loses by that single Transaction.
But the Indigent Man, who is to provide
himself Necessaries with the Summ that
he so receives; And the Wealthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
also, that lays by his Summs till
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51076:13"/>
they grow great enough for some Bargain
that he has in prospect, or that keeps
them only for the currant Course of his
ordinary Expences; will both of them cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
lose. For the Rate of every thing
rising proportionably to this Alteration in
Coin; Whatever either of them have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to buy will be so much dearer than
it was before, as their Money is now
worse. And so much they therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
lose.</p>
            <p>But this is not all. The Consideration
of the Landed Man's Rents (whether he
be really Opulent or Indigent) reaches
much further. 'Tis not only one single Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but a continued Course of Annual
Payments that he is to take Care for.
Supposing Coin raised (as 'tis called) a
Half or a Quarter part; He will not only
lose so much, by the first Quarter's or Half-year's
Rent that he receives; But for all
Leases, Rent-Charges, and other fixt Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
whatsoever, he will evidently go
on to lose, Quarterly and Annually, in the
same manner, for the Future, as long as
the Terms of those Contracts continue.
Nay, without restraining this Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Leases and Rent-Charges, even for
all Lands, lett Year by Year without any
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51076:13"/>
such fixt Stipulation, he will continue to
lose considerably for a long while toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Those that will answer any thing, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently,
to this last Suggestion, (for to
the first nothing can be answered) I am
bold to say, have no other way to do it
than by maintaining that the Rents of
Lands must of Necessity rise also, as well
as Commodities; in proportion to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution,
(which they call the Heightning)
of Coin. But in doing so, they shew ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
the Absurdity of their own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
For to what purpose should this
Alteration be made in Coin, when every
thing else will thereupon alter according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and return in a short while to bear
the same proportion to the new Names,
Weight, and Fineness of Coin, as they did
before to the Old? 'Tis visible there is no
other End in it but the inriching of a few
Money-mongers: And that the Nation can
receive no Advantage by it, more than
the Use of so much Cash as they shall
graciously please, upon such a Bribe, to
issue forth towards the Payment of their
own Debts. I am obliged therefore to
grant, by my own Principles (and I am
glad our Antagonists are thus far forced to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51076:14"/>
agree with me) that in Consequence of
this <hi>Raising of Coin,</hi> the Rents of Land
must of Necessity rise also. But I desire
it may be observed, that the Rise of Rents
is a thing that proceeds very gradually.
The Farmer will not easily be brought
to own that the Advancement which he
will find in the Price of his Commodities,
after the <hi>Raising of Coin,</hi> proceeds from
that Reason. <hi>No, Master,</hi> says he to his
Landlord, <hi>tho' this have been a pretty good
Year to us, the like has been many times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and the next following it has been a
bad one. God knows but it may be so now.
Therefore I hope your Worship will not be
hard with me. I have been a long while a
good Tenant to your Family,</hi> &amp;c. Such
things as these repeated over and over
again, without any notice taken of the
Reasons offered to the contrary, will wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
out many a Landlord's Patience, many
a time over, before their Tenants will be
brought to make new Bargains. 'Tis true,
that in the End they must infallibly come
to it. But I believe all Landlords are
sensible that this must be a Work of time:
And whilst this Suspense and Contest lasts,
the Landlords must certainly go on losing,
Annually, by the Alteration that I argue
against.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:51076:14"/>
However, since I am here struck upon
this fatal Rock, which (if our Coin be
raised) will be unavoidably very ruinous
to all that have any manner of Debts
due to them upon Ancient Contracts; I
cannot omit to communicate to all Men
what I am informed has of late been pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
by many, by way of precaution
against such like future Inconveniences.
The thing I mean, is a few words added
to the Condition of Bonds, (of which,
printed Copies are to be had at the Stamp-Office,
by those that will require them)
and to all other Contracts for Payments,
in this Form.—<hi>Pay to—the Summ
of—of Good and Lawful Money of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<hi>of the Weight and Fineness of the
Standard establish'd by Law, at the time of
the Date hereof, for the Silver Coin of this
Kingdom; Without any Deduction or Ab<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

whatsoever for or by reason of any
Act of Parliament which shall or may be
made, or for any other reason or cause what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</hi>
This Advertisement is perhaps
needless, because the thing is already pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
generally known, and has been some
while practised by many: Yet since it
may be of Use to some, I hope others
will excuse me for having here inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:51076:15"/>
The next Consideration that occurs to
my thoughts, is the Consequence that this
heightning of Coin may have upon His
Majesty's Exchequer and Revenue. I
confess, that I am not acquainted with
any Secrets relating to that Matter: And
therefore, tho' I were inclined, yet I am
not able to entertain my Reader's Fancy
with curious Discoveries of what ought
to be kept hid. But things that every
body sees, I suppose, I may be allow'd
to speak of. That the Crown and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
are at this present vastly in
Debt, no body is or can be ignorant.
Now, suppose a Law were ready drawn,
and a Party of Men prepared to favour
it, so that the very first Week after the
Parliament's Meeting (let us say the First
Day of <hi>November</hi> next) it should be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
that from that day forwards a Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece
of Silver, now worth Five Shillings,
should in all Payments whatsoever pass
for Six. What may such a one as I,
(who am not able to see far into a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone)
observe that His Majesty would
be like to gain or lose by that Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance?</p>
            <p>It is plain, that whatever the Debt of
the Crown be (suppose Six Shillings, Six
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51076:15"/>
Pounds, or what you please) if the King
had Five of them now treasur'd up in
his Exchequer, He would by that Act be
inabled with those Five to pay the whole
Six. That is, he would gain one sixth
part upon whatsoever the Total Summ
of his Debt amounted to: And his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
his Navy, the City, the Country,
All, that upon the Publick Faith of Acts
of Parliament have Lent their Money for
the Support of the Government, would
lose it. But can so mean a Brokage as
this be thought suitable to the Dignity
of Kings? <hi>Avant,</hi> all those that have the
Impudence to propose it! They are bold
Men, if there be any such, that dare ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
a thing at once so dishonourable to
His Majesty, and so injurious to all those
that compose the Strength and possess the
Wealth of <hi>England. Let it not be told in</hi>
Gath, <hi>let it not be published in the Streets
of</hi> Askelon; <hi>(lest the</hi> Philistines <hi>rejoice).</hi>
That ever the Morality of <hi>England</hi> was
sunk so low, as to bear the least Debate,
in any Assembly whatsoever, upon so
sordid and unjust a Proposition. I say,
in any Assembly whatsoever; But least
of all in our August and Venerable As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
of Parliament. The Thought of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51076:16"/>
it is not to be born, that any Man in
that Assembly should have the Face to
propose a thing which all Mankind must
have in so great Abomination: The
Breach I mean (and I say it again) of all
those solemn Engagements of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Faith, upon which so many Millions
of late Years have been advanced for
Publick Service. And as for His Majesty
himself; If this were indeed the Case,
that his Exchequer were now replenish'd
with many hidden Millions, capable to
pay off the whole Debt of the Crown,
immediately after the foresaid Law should
be enacted; Yet both the Injustice and
the Infamy of the thing ought sufficiently
to assure us He would abhor the Thought
of it. And this being the only Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
that can be put, of any Advantage
possible to accrue to His Majesty by the
<hi>raising of Coin;</hi> they must, I say, have a
very extraordinary Stock of Confidence,
that would dare to propose it to him,
even in this its best appearance.</p>
            <p>His Majesty will certainly propose to
himself the most worthy, and such as are
therefore the most glorious Examples, for
his Imitation. The excellent <hi>Italian</hi> Poet
<hi>Dante,</hi> whose Works will live, has fixt a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51076:16"/>
lasting Epithite of Reproach upon the
Memory of <hi>Philip le Bel,</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi>
calling him <hi>Falsificatore di Moneta; <hi>The

               </hi> Because he was the first
that debased the Coin of <hi>France,</hi> by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
it to be received upon a higher

him repent when it was too late. I might

is a fair and plain Contract that a Prince
makes with his Subjects: The Clauses of
which, Casuists maintain, ought not to be
changed, without mutual Consent. He is not
the Master, nor Proprietor of the Species,
altho' they bear his Image and his Arms.
They belong to his Subjects, who possess
them. And 'tis for this Reason that those
who by their Absolute Authority have dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
the worth of their Coins, for their
own Profit, have been always censured as
Usurpers of a thing that they had no Right
to.</hi> To this I will add only one other
Authority, to confirm what has been said
of the general Sense of all Men upon the
different Conduct of Princes or Magistrates
in this particular. 'Tis that

               <hi>Money of</hi> Rome
<hi>being so corrupted</hi> (it was
in the Sixth Century from
the Foundation of that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
<hi>that no Man could know
what he received or paid,
a Law was made for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medying
of it; Which was
a thing of so great Honour</hi> to him who got
the Credit of it with the People, that in
every Street <hi>they erected Statues to him,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51076:18"/>
offering Incense, and burning Tapers before
them. In a word, no Man was ever dearer
to them.</hi> This Reformation of Abuses in
Coin, and an exact Justice in maintaining
their true worth both in purity and weight,
under the establish'd Denominations, being
things that in all Ages have been most
acceptable to the People concerned, and
have rendred the Names of their Authors
most honourable to Posterity; Far be it
from me to doubt that our present Prince
(though the Temptation of his own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
were never so strong, as it is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary)
could ever be perswaded to infringe
these Rules of Equity, and violate a thing
so Sacred. I add this word, <hi>Sacred:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Wisest of the Ancients did ever
esteem the business of their Money to be so;
Or at least thought fit to imprint such a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
of it in the People: And therefore
they either Coined it in the Temples of
their Gods, or erected Altars in the place
where they did it.</p>
            <p>But it is time that we now consider this
Matter, not by Suppositions only, but as
it is in reality. And what shall we then
say of those Projectors, that under the
Colour (no Colour) <hi>of raising Coin,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
a thing that will be so considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51076:18"/>
prejudicial to His Majesty's Interest?
All I can say of them is, that whether
they do it ignorantly or designedly, the
Mischief to His Majesty is the same; And
it ought to be obviated with utmost
Care, by all that have Capacity and Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to intermeddle in it. 'Tis too noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to be dissembled, that the Exchequer is
not now replenish'd with any Treasure: So
that if such a Law (as I have supposed, to
take place the First of <hi>November</hi> next)
were past, the King could have no manner
of present Benefit by it: And for the
Future he would lose at one stroke the
Sixth part of all his Revenue. The Case
is the very same (if not yet harder) in
respect of the King, that I have shewn it
to be in respect of Wealthy Gentlemen,
who have their Estates out either in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
upon Bonds and Mortgages, or in
Lands upon running Leases. Whatever there
are of Crown Lands, no body will think that
the Rent of them will be either more speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or more easily raised than those of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Gentlemen, but much the Contrary.
But, however, the great and fixt Branches
of His Majesty's Revenue, Excise and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms,
are too considerable to require any
other Instance to be joined with them, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51076:19"/>
too obviously within this Case to admit
of any Dispute. They are settled by Acts
of Parliament, and will continue to be paid
accordingly. So that if our Coin should
now be raised (as 'tis called) one sixth
part; the King's Revenue would be just
one sixth part diminish'd. His Majesty has
much Obligation indeed to the Promoters
of such a Design.</p>
            <p>It would be pleasant to hear them ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
(the only thing that can be argued
against what I here maintain;) That the
Parliament may raise those Duties so much
higher, or give the King something else
equivalent to the Loss that he may sustain
in them. This is just according to the
Old Proverb; <hi>Make Work and have Work.</hi>
But, <hi>Cui bono?</hi> Why all this Noise? Why
all this Bustle? Why all these Changes?
When we are to be brought round to the
same Point from whence we set forth?
For 'tis even so. And in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
the Answer to these Questions brings
me round also. Why; <hi>All this is for the
sake of a few Money-mongers.</hi> There is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more nor less in the Matter. They,
and They only, that have enrich'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by the several Steps that we have
hitherto seen, will be able to get any
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51076:19"/>
thing by this finishing Stroke. Finishing
I mean, to their prodigious Wealth; And
at the same time (if not absolutely finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
I am sure too strongly leading to the
fatal finishing of <hi>England</hi>'s Ruin.</p>
            <p>Our Apprehensions of Publick Ruin, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such an Alteration, will appear more
obviously reasonable, if we add this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Reflection upon the present Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of the Nation. Every body is sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
how much the last Year's intended
Supplies fell short: And how very great a
Summ will therefore this Year be necessary.
I presume not so much as to guess at it.
But all Men know it must needs be so
much as to exceed all possibility of being
raised upon the People, any way what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
in one Year. We have no way in
the World to maintain our selves but by
settling some Funds or other, as we have
done of late Years, and borrowing the
Money upon it by way of Anticipation.
Now this being our Case, if we should at
this time, by <hi>raising our Coin,</hi> do so great
and so manifest a wrong, as I have shewn
this would be, to all those that have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
contributed to our Support; whose
Estates in the different Funds already set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled,
would thereby become just so much
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51076:20"/>
less as our Money should be raised; I say,
if we should now but shew our selves ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of so much Ingratitude and so much
Treachery, from whence could we expect
any further Support of the like kind?
We should certainly be abandon'd by all
Men; We should deservedly sink into ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Ruin; And our Destruction must be
owned to be our selves. I am not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to think that any Man is capable of
giving this Counsel designedly for this
End: But (I say again) the Consequences
of this Practice appear to me so dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ruinous, that it ought to be avoided
with the same Care as if it were evidently
so designed.</p>
            <p>I come now to consider the Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that this <hi>raising of our Coin</hi> can have
upon the whole Nation collectively, with
respect to all those with whom we have
any manner of Dealing abroad. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
is, that if our Coin were raised, our
Money would not be carried Beyond-Sea.
That is the thing we are now to enquire
into: But, I protest, I am almost ashamed
to go about it. Those that have any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Sence, and know in the least how
the World goes cannot but be satisfied,
that by one single Calculation in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51076:20"/>
Letter, I have demonstrated that there
is no such Matter. Our Money is not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
Abroad; Nor could it, nor can it be,
upon account of private Gain; Whilst the
Exchange was (as when I writ last) at
Thirty three Skillings, and much more
whilst it is (as now) at Thirty Six. Nay,
nor ever can it be carried Abroad at all,
if our different Coins were once brought
to an Equality, (which the Use of Scales
would effect in a moment) unless the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Summ of our Debts to Foreigners a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
to more than theirs to us. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
that happens (which can only be by
an Over-balance in Trade, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
more of their Commodities than they
do of ours; Or by some great occasion of
State, the Expence of a Foreign War, or
the like) I say, whenever this happens, there
is no Remedy for it: Money will go: And
the raising of its Name can no more keep
it, than the <hi>Gothamers</hi> by a Hedge could
keep in the Cuckow.</p>
            <p>What carried our Money Beyond Sea, a
Year and two Years ago, to so great a
Degree, was only the Inequality of it.
Surely that has been made plain enough
already. How oft must I inculcate the same
thing; That the Cure, therefore can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51076:21"/>
in nothing but the Equality? After that
is perfectly effected, let but Trade be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
inspected and duly promoted, (Trade
which is of more Importance to us than
Mines either of Silver or Gold) and the
Expence even of a Foreign War (if also
duly managed) would not be so over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burdensome
and ruinous to this Nation as
we are apt to think it.</p>
            <p>But let us however examine over again
our present Circumstances, in relation to the
Exportation of Coin, as I did before. The
Exchange I have said now is at 36 Skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
Flemish <hi>per</hi> Pound Sterling (I speak
within compass) which is between 9 and
10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> more favourable on our side
(that is more incouraging to the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Money, and discouraging to the
Exportation of it) than it was then. If there
were considerable loss therefore, by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation
of it at that time, there would be
much more loss now. So we may conclude
certainly that it is not done: And the pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
made about <hi>raising of Coin,</hi> is but as the
preparing of a Remedy for a wrong Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease.
(<hi>Fortasse Cupressum scis simulare. Quid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoc;
Si fractis enatat exspes Navibus, aere
dato qui pingitur?</hi>) 'Tis nothing at all to
the purpose.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:51076:21"/>
Further, That Bullion is now probably
imported, at least not exported, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
by the best of Arguments, the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
of the most considerable
Dealers in it; Amongst which are some that,
against all Sense but their own private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
were formerly very eminent in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
Principles which their present De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
contradicts. The thing I mean, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
clearly express'd in the Order of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of the <hi>24th. September,</hi> Printed in the
Gazette of the <hi>28th.</hi> These Gentlemen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
<hi>that Liberty may be given for the
Coining of Gold (of which,</hi> they say, <hi>they
have considerable Quantities) at their own
Charge;</hi> Because, <hi>They cannot export it,
by reason of the present Course of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
without great Loss.</hi> How comes
it to pass that Guinea's, which, Six or Nine
Months ago, were by some Men maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be intrinsecally worth 30 <hi>s.</hi> can now
by the same Men be afforded to be coined
at 22 Shillings, and they also pay the
Charge of the Coinage? The Guinea's must
be coined still of the same Weight and Fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
And there has been no new Mine of
Gold found any where in the World (that
we hear of) to cause so vast an Importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Gold into <hi>Europe,</hi> as to alter the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51076:22"/>
Value of it very near one third part. The
thing is plain. <hi>Habemus confitentem Reum.</hi>
The former Pretences of these Men were
all Juggle, and founded on nothing but the
very basest Degree of Private Interest; That
by which any one particular Man preferrs,
not his Life, not a Competency of Estate,
but a little Superfluity of Wealth, before
the Riches, the Happiness, nay, the very
Subsistence of his own whole Country.
<hi>Out of thy own Mouth I will judge thee, thou
wicked Servant.</hi> Thus it is probable that
Gold has of late been brought into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
At least it is evident, that it has not
been carried out. The Matter of Fact is
undeniable. And therefore, I say again,
the Raising of our Coin is now nothing at
all to our Purpose.</p>
            <p>But it may be objected, that both my
former Calculation, and what I have now
added, relate only to Gold: So that, for
any thing I have said, Silver may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
still. To that, one single Word
may be sufficient to answer. Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
bear the same Proportion in Value to
each other throughout all <hi>Europe,</hi> as they
did some Months ago: And the General
Course of the Exchange, between any one
Country and another, is not singly ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51076:22"/>
upon, or regulated by, the Plenty or
Want of either of them separately in this
or the other Place; but by the Total Summ
of both (consider'd as Money) and the
Want or Plenty arising from thence, in
this place, with respect to the same Total,
and the concomitant Circumstances and
Occasions, in another place. I see, I must
explain my self by an Example. Gold and
Silver bear the same Proportion in Value
to each other in <hi>Holland</hi> as they did: And
the like in <hi>England.</hi> Now if in <hi>England</hi>
there be a plenty either of Gold or Silver,
which is either wanted in <hi>Holland,</hi> or by
any Occasion of State or Trade becomes
due to <hi>Holland,</hi> (or <hi>Vice Versa</hi>) The Summ
of this Gold or Silver, so much as is either
wanted or due, must either be transported
in Specie, or remitted by Exchange: And
whilst their proportional Respect to each
other remains fixt, 'tis no matter at all
which of them is either received or paid.
The Rise or Fall of the Exchange depends
intirely upon the Remittance of so much
Money, more or less, whether it be Gold or
Silver. And therefore when I have proved
that in this present Course of Exchange,
Gold cannot be exported from <hi>England</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Holland,</hi> I have at the same time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51076:23"/>
that Silver cannot be so transported
neither. This, I say, still taking the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
between Gold and Silver to be fixt;
Or at least, to vary so little as not to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
the Charge and Hazard of sending
both the one and the other backwards and
forwards by Sea: Which (I add) is our
present Case. For tho' the Rate of Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea's,
at 22 Shillings, be a little above their
true Proportion in respect to Silver; that
Difference is not so much as to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
the Charge and Risk of sending Silver
into <hi>Holland</hi> for to bring over Gold hither.
So that it remains evident, after all, that
our Money of any kind is not now export<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and that therefore we have no occasion
at all to raise it, upon that Account.</p>
            <p>But nevertheless, I will not leave the
Issue of the Matter upon this single Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.
Let us suppose (tho' at this
time not true) that our Money were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported;
And now examine how the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of it would prevent that Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
Or what other Consequences it would
or could have, with respect to Foreigners.
The Raising of Money I have shewn to be
nothing but the changing of some Names:
For the applying of old Names, to Pieces
of different Weight from what those Names
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51076:23"/>
were formerly applied to, is the same thing.
No Body thinks of Recoining once again
all our <hi>Species,</hi> and mixing them with a
greater Allay of Baser Metal than what they
now contain. It is proposed therefore, that
our Shillings, our Crowns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
just as they are; But a Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece
(for Example) shall be made to go
for Six Shillings, and other Pieces in the
same Proportion. This is, according to
the Sence of these Projectors, a raising of
the Crown one Fifth part in respect of what
it was at first, Or one Sixth part in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of what it shall now be made to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify.
He were a powerful Prince indeed, or
that were a powerful State, that could im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a Law of this kind, with any real
Effect, upon all the World. But I believe
no Government whatsoever will find its
Authority in these Matters, to extend any
further than its own Dominions: And
even within them too, I have shewn it
(at best) to be very useless.</p>
            <p>But let us see, upon the Supposition of
this Change in <hi>England,</hi> how the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
and Bankers in <hi>Holand</hi> would ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
their Affairs. Advice of this Change
arrives there on the Morning of the Post-Day
that they are to write for <hi>England:</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:51076:24"/>
And the Course of the Exchange must be
regulated at Noon. That Course was, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
at the Receipt of those Letters, at
35 Skillings (for it is and must of Necessity
be always something lower there than here.)
Hereupon those that have occasion either to
remit or draw, if it happen that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make the Computation in their Heads,
lean a while upon the next Shop-stall, and
having pondered a little upon the State of
the Case, they find it to be thus. <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
say they to themselves, has divided
its Crown into Seventy Two Parts, or
Pence, which before they divided but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Sixty: And have enacted, That Sixty
of these Seventy Two shall pass in Tale
for a Crown, as the whole Sixty did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Then, with their Pencil on the Back
of some Letter, they set themselves this
plain Question, by the Rule of Three.
<hi>If Seventy Two of those New Pence contain
but Sixty Old ones; Then how many Old ones
are contained in Sixty New Ones?</hi> And they
find the Answer to be <hi>Fifty.</hi> So, say they
next; <hi>Since English men for Sixty will give
us but Fifty, how many must we give them
for Thirty Five;</hi> which should have been
the Rate of the Exchange this Day, if they
had not alter'd the Measure of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce?
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51076:24"/>
And to that they find the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to be Twenty Nine and One Sixth:
That is 29 Skillings 2 Pence Flemish, for
One Pound Sterling. Thus the Exchange
will infallibly settle that very Hour. And he
that the foregoing Post received, for the Bills
that he drew there, after the rate of 35 of
their Skillings for one of our old Pounds,
shall now receive but 29 ss. 2 <hi>d.</hi> of theirs for
one of our New ones. And after this Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the future Course of Exchange will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
continue on (altering up and down as
other Occasions influence it) in the same
Proportion.</p>
            <p>What need more words? Thus it has
been, in all Places where the like Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
have been made. Thus it was with
us, when we had nothing but Clipp'd
Money going. And thus it always will
be, in the like Occasions, all the World
over. I would have the Projectors of
this Alteration hereupon sit down, and
consider with themselves, when the Post
shall return from <hi>Holland</hi> with Advice of
this New Course of Exchange, what Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
they will find <hi>England</hi> to have got
by their Project. The Bankers will have
eluded the Design of it first: Next, the
Merchants will follow, and sell us their
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51076:25"/>
Commodities (as we shall certainly force
them to buy ours) so much dearer: Every
thing will alter in the same proportion.
And thus we are once again got round to
the Point from whence we first set out.
And you are very Welcom, Gentlemen.</p>
            <p>All this is trifling Foolery. But that my
Writing upon it may not be so too, I must
now own that there remains one Case,
wherein it seems as if the Nation might
gain considerably, upon Foreigners, by the
<hi>raising of our Coin:</hi> I should add still, (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
they will suffer us to do it). 'Tis
just in the same manner as I have said the
<hi>Rich Debtors</hi> amongst our selves might
gain by it upon their Creditors. That is,
in plain Terms, we might effectually cheat
all Foreigners of such a proportion of the
Debts we owe them at the time we play
this Trick, as is the proportion in which
our Coin is raised. We could not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to do it any longer; Because they
would immediately alter the Exchange (the
Balance of Commerce between them and
us) and set future Accounts upon a right
foot. But for the first time, 'tis true, we
might catch them, and make a brave Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
by it.</p>
            <p>Is not this Excellent Work? What Prince,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51076:25"/>
what State, would treat, or have any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Dealings with us; If we should thus
infamously break our Publick Faith, at the
same time with one another at home, and
with all the World Abroad? Nay, can we
doubt but all Foreign Princes and States
would immediately settle Methods for taking
Reprizals upon us one way or other? Let
us reflect what we should be apt to say upon
an Enemy that might do the same, or
any thing of the like Nature. The Case is
too odious to be supposed of an Ally, or of
a Friend. But what if this Absolute King
of <hi>France,</hi> before these Wars, when his
Country had so vast a Trade, and many
Foreigners, <hi>English, Dutch,</hi> and others, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siding
in it; What if he, I say, observing
then the insignificancy of the Project of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
his Coin to his own Subjects amongst
themselves, should instead thereof (<hi>by his
Certain Knowledge, Absolute Power, and Royal
Authority,</hi> as his Stile goes) have ordained,
out of his great Desire to promote the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of his own Subjects, that all of
them who were indebted to any Foreigners
should be obliged to pay but four Fifths of
their respective Debts, and that in doing so,
no Action should lie against them for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder?
Had He done thus; What Names
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51076:26"/>
would he have thought bad enough, to have
given him? I will not foul my Paper with
things so indecent. But let us, for shame,
consider that what we talk about <hi>raising our
Coin,</hi> has neither more nor less Justice in it,
with respect to the Debts we shall happen
to owe Foreigners at the time when the
thing is done; But a great deal less Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
than this supposed Ord'nance of the
<hi>French</hi> King; Because it will cause us a
great deal more Trouble and Confusion
amongst our selves.</p>
            <p>I hope, Sir, I have now said enough upon
this Subject. But if it be too much, as is
most likely; And that I have tired you
with it; Instead of concluding, I will yet
take the Liberty to add one thing further,
for a Farewel <hi>Gusto.</hi> 'Tis the Copy of a
Letter that has been sent me, writ by a
Person altogether unknown to me, who
lived in <hi>Spain</hi> in the Year 1686. when
the King of <hi>Spain</hi> endeavoured to raise his
<hi>Piece of Eight</hi> one Fifth part, by calling
it <hi>Escudo.</hi> The Case is so parallel to our
Project, and this Gentleman's representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Consequences of it so ingenious,
that I cannot think but I shall divert you
in transcribing his very words. They are
as follows:</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Have received yours, wherein you desire me
to remind you of some Passages which I
have formerly told you happen'd in <hi>Spain</hi> whilst
I was there, upon that King's endeavouring to
raise the Value of the Coin of that Kingdom
one Fifth part; which it was believed would
infallibly hinder the Exportation of it. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
in the Year 1686. a Proclamation was
Published commanding all Persons to take the
<hi>Piece of Eight,</hi> (which to that time had passed
for eight <hi>Reals)</hi> at ten; And that for the future
those <hi>Pieces of Eight</hi> should be called <hi>Escudos:</hi>
Because New <hi>Pieces of Eight</hi> were Coined
which were one Fifth part less in weight than
those. These were subdivided into Halves,
Quarters, and Eights which they called <hi>Reals,</hi>
and the other small Pieces which had been
Halves, Quarters and Eights to the old <hi>Pieces of
Eight,</hi> bore then the same relation to the <hi>Escudo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Gold was not altered in Name, but only
in the supposed Value: Supposed I call it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it soon appeared to be impracticable to
make any other than an imaginary Alteration
in the Value of Coin by Proclamation; As the
following Relation will, I doubt not, demonstrate.</p>
                  <p>The Proclamation strictly commanded that no
Person should advance the Price of any Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51076:27"/>
with regard to the Advance of the Coin, but
that every Man should be obliged to Sell all
sorts of Merchandize at the same Prices which
they Sold for at the time of the Proclamation.
And the Magistrates had strict Charge to take
due Care<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that no Person might go unpunished,
who should refuse to Sell according to this Order:
By which means every Trader was compelled to
deliver as many Goods for Four <hi>Pieces of Eight,</hi>
as he had lately Sold for Five; Tho' there was
no reason for the falling of the said Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</p>
                  <p>This Rigour was used for some time in most
Parts, if not throughout the whole Kingdom;
Insomuch, that the Foreign Merchants residing
in <hi>Spain,</hi> applied themselves to their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
in the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> and home to
their Principals in each Foreign State, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
of this Abuse; And till they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to Sell their Goods for what they could
afford them, they appeared not in their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
for fear they should be obliged to Sell them
to Loss.</p>
                  <p>For they all understood that an <hi>Escudo</hi> sent
into their own Country, would not sell for more
than when it was called a <hi>Piece of Eight.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would it long Purchase any more in the
Markets of <hi>Spain</hi> it self: For every Seller in
the Kingdom soon perceived the Fraud, and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51076:27"/>
would not part with this Goods till the Buyer had
agreed to pay an <hi>Escudo</hi> for what he used to
buy for the same Piece of Money when it was
called a <hi>Piece of Eight:</hi> And then there was as
much advantage by Exporting the Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
as before. So that it plainly appears, that
Kingdom received no other Benefit by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of changing the Name of the Coin, except
the unjust gain of a Fifth part of such Debts as
were then due from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to the foreign
Merchants that traded with them. The King,
indeed, by paying his Debts, according to the
Rate of the Proclamation, brought great Losses
upon many of his own Subjects, as well as Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners;
which unequal dealing, was retalia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
upon him by the Farmers of his Revenues,
and others who stood indebted to the Crown.</p>
                  <p>By what has been said, it may easily be
guessed, that the Landlords in that Kingdom,
together with the Merchants, as well Natives as
Foreigners, who generally give credit for great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Summs than they owe, could not be perswaded
that it was just, that they should be obliged to
discharge their Tenants and Debtors, for four
Fifths of their Debts in Money, and <hi>one Fifth
in Proclamation;</hi> which in a little time, would
not purchase any thing in the Market.</p>
                  <p>When this News reached <hi>England,</hi> the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
were very unwilling to abate one Fifth
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51076:28"/>
of their Debts, or to be obliged to part with
their Goods for less than they cost; And in all
their Letters to their Agents in <hi>Spain,</hi> refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
upon the dishonesty of the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> Nay,
some of that People perceiving the Injustice of
this Usage, tho' the Law would have allowed
them to have paid Eighty for a Hundred,
could not prevail with themselves to do so much
Injury to their Creditors; but like honest Men,
paid so many <hi>Escudo's</hi> as they intended to pay
<hi>Pieces of Eight</hi> when they contracted that Debt:
Because, said they, we are satisfied, that our
Creditors designed to have so many of those ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Pieces which were called <hi>Pieces of Eight</hi> at
the time when they parted with their Goods.</p>
                  <p>The same just dealing I my self met with
from a Trader there, to whom I had given cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
before the Proclamation: And when he told
me he came to pay his Debt, I expected to have
received it with the same D<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mination as others
generally did; and that he would have taken all
the Advantage the Law allowed. But he was so
just, that he paid me as much Silver as I expected
to have received from him at the time I sold him
my Goods. For which when I thanked him, and
told him he had done me a piece of Iustice,
which I did not expect; he gave me for Answer,
That if he had found the King could have rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Value, when he altered the Name of the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51076:28"/>
Coin, then he would have paid me according to
the Proclamation; but since he was sensible he
could not make his <hi>Escudo</hi> purchase more at
Market than when it was called a <hi>Piece of
Eight,</hi> he thought himself obliged to pay me
as many of them as I understood I was to have,
and he contracted to give me, before the King
changed their Name. For, said he, the King's
altering the Name of the <hi>Piece of Eight,</hi> seems
to me to be as if we should suppose my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<hi>Peter</hi> to be possessed of Ten Thousand
Ducats Estate; and me, who am called <hi>John,</hi>
to have but Two Thousand; and that the King
should by Proclamation, cause me to be called
<hi>Peter,</hi> thereby designing to make me worth Ten
Thousand Ducats also: For unless, at the same
time, he would add to my Estate, I fear nay
Purse would not be heavier than when I was
called <hi>John.</hi> And therefore, tho' the King has
obliged me to discharge my Debtors, if they
pay me four Fifths of their Debts, yet I don't
think it just for me not to pay better: And I
am not willing to be <hi>sent to the Devil by a
Proclamation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus, Sir, I have given you the best Account
I am capable of, what passed in <hi>Spain</hi> whilst I
was there, upon their Endeavours to raise the
Value of their Coin; and methinks, the bad
success they had in the Experiment of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51076:29"/>
should be sufficient, when impartially consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
to convince us that it is not possible to
raise the Value of Gold and Silver otherways
than in Imagination; And that the attempting
it would not serve to any other end than to
give oportunity to every Debtor to cheat his
Creditor, and every tenant to defraud his
Landlord throughout the Nation, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
the Trading People in their Accounts.</p>
                  <p>I am, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, pray, Sir, What think you
of <hi>paying Debts,</hi> and of being <hi>sent to the
Devil by Proclamation?</hi> I am,</p>
