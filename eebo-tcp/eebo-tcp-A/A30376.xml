            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Dr. Burnet's LETTER To his Friend in LONDON. Being an Answer to a late Scurrilous Pamphlet Entituled HIS FAREWEL.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>MY acquaintance with you, which happily commenced at our meeting in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and those many friendly caresses wherewith you have vouchsaf'd to salute me, are the daily remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancers of that great respect and veneration I owe you, and seem to imply that I have leave to address my self to you as to an <hi>Asylum,</hi> a place of refuge and security. I know Sir, you are, so great a friend to truth and honesty, that you always appear vigorous in the defence of Innocency, you comfort the Dejected, relieve the Oppressed, and to speak the sence of all that know you, your Charity is universal, and extends it self to the several exigences of those that become your Petitioners.</p>
            <p>My circumstances at present enforce me Sir (without any Introductions, or circumlocutions) to Sollicit your favour for the prevention of that mischief that so loudly threatens me. I am sensible that the lashes, and persecutions of malevolent Tongues, are more intolerable than the severest of human inflictions, and to my great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dissatisfaction I find, since my departure, I am too too grosly scandaliz'd, and reproach't<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what the consequence of such popular licence may prove, such a discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing person as your self may easily foresee: To you therefore Sir, and to all other Gentlemen of the like integrity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and veracity, I apply my self, that by your undaunted Vindication of me, you may put a check to that impetuous torrent of Scandall that seems to overwhelm me.</p>
            <p>I am lately Sir, expos'd, and insufferably abus'd not only by the perverse Tongues of inveterate Men, whose Passions are as irregular as their Morals; But by the wider and more licentious Mouth of the Press: The scurrilous Pamphlet has circulated the Town, and by this time I presume it is seen by you. How full of Spleen and Malice it is, is easily discernable to any unprejudic'd person. The Spirit of malediction is so notoriously visible through every line, that one would think, people should not be so credulous as to take for granted, what is so slily insinuated by the mercenary-Scribler. I shall therefore unravel all the Vanity, Folly, and inconsistency of that sheet that bears so hard upon my Reputation. Wherein you must understand he First gives me the Title of a <hi>Confessor,</hi> yes and <hi>Confessor</hi> to the Late King of <hi>Poland,</hi> too. A great promotion to which this insignificant Pamphleteer advances me: Certainly if ever impudence be reckon'd a vertue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> t'will be now, for never did sham, and imposture prevail so much upon a people as at this Instant,</p>
            <p>The next Complement he affords me is no less than deep dy'd <hi>Rebel,</hi> and maks me leap from <hi>Poland</hi> into <hi>Hungary</hi> in a moment, and to show himself a man of judgment he pretends a substantial reason for so doing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is <gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>

               <gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> (his hard word) <hi>Congeniality</hi> to the <hi>Cause</hi> here. Profound pieces of Scandal! I would fain know whether this mighty Man of Parallels, values him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon such a production; if he does, I must tell him, that any <hi>Billingsgate</hi> Oyster Woman can easily arrive at the like excellence. For Scandal, and Reproach is the talent of the Rabble, and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and Carmen can challenge as great a share as our Scribler. But however Sir, this is my comfort, that men of that sobriety and seriousness of life with your selfe, cannot easily entertain any vile, or mean thought of me. Now <gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> this clutter about <hi>Hungarian</hi> Rebells his <hi>Tapsky</hi>'s-<hi>Perkinaski</hi>'s, his ridiculous chiming with <hi>Routs</hi> and <hi>Riots, Confusion,</hi> and <hi>Faction</hi>; His prophane intermixing Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred History with his excrementitious stuff, his ridiculous discourse of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Dyet,</hi> his foolish story of Milk and Mackrel; What is it the Gentleman fixes upon me? Why Sir, tis some Enormous Crime, some <hi>grande nefas, &amp; morte piandum,</hi> no less than <hi>Misprision</hi> at least. Now where's the proof of what is so heavily lay'd to my charge? Not a word of seriousness, argument, or any thing like to be found.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:29949:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>I shall therefore to satisfy you Sir (and all whose curiosity leads e'm to peruse those Pamphlets that are dayly vended) open my self with all ingenuous freedom and plainenss, for the confirmation of that good opinion you have conceiv'd of me. The general outcry against me is in reference to that Gentleman, my late Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> of my advising him to conceal and palliate those things, which he seem'd to confess of his own inclination; The report is so current and so universally received, that it is not without great difficulty to remove their prejudices. But those that will credit truth when, as delivered with such asseverations, can distinguish 'twixt credulity, and mistaken zeal, and I suppose will vouchsafe to believe me upon those Protestations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I declare that I had no other design in visiting my Lord in his unhappy circumstances, than to give him Spiritual instructions and advice for the benefit of his Immortal Soul. Let the malice of men suggest what it pleases, the dictates of my own conscience tell me, that I have done nothing but what a Christian might Honourably justify before the face of the whole World. And in that capacity of a Divine, I reckon'd it my duty (considering my acquaintance with his Lordship) to interpose with my Prayers and Spiritual assistances. But for having that influence over his Lordship, as people wou'd fain represent, is a mistake as groundless as ridiculous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Besides, they little imagine how much they reflect upon his Lordship's judgment, to be byast according to the insinuations of any near him. 'Tis certain my Lord fell not under the Character of so injudicious a Person amongst the knowing part of mankind, as to be so easy, and credulous as to be modell'd according to any one's fancy.</p>
            <p>But for my self I must declare that I had no interest in paying him those frequent visits, but the real promotion of his Souls Eternal welfare.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As for my disaffection to the present Establish't Government or my lukewarmness, or damn'd neutrality (as they call it) 'tis as Groundless as the former objection against me. I am, I presume, so well known, that I need not make any great Apology for this calumny against me. Those that have had the opportunity of my Conversation and the advantage of my Ministry, cannot find by any of my discourses any thing tending to the derogation of the Government.</p>
            <p>However this abusive Pamphleteer takes great Freedom with me, and 'tis no wonder, for it must be an elevated piece of Impudence that does the thing when nothing of reality appears in the Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Be pleas'd to observe the scurrility of his language; he says I have nothing but a <hi>Religious</hi> cant <hi>to recommend me to the Observation of any judicious person.</hi> I have no mind to take notice of the obloquy, since I am not fond of my Credit in that particular. There is no man has more humble thoughts of himself then I have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for his envious reflections that I was taken notice of before any of the Reverend Prelates of the Land, by the Members of Parliament, I have nothing to say at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, but that my designs were Honourable, without any affectation of popularity.</p>
            <p>I must be bold to say that I have a great veneration for that <hi>August</hi> Assembly, and what I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the Pulpit, has been honestly design'd, and mean't.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As for those Doctrines which he would needs insinuate that I approve; I utterly deny it. <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance</hi> and <hi>taking up Arms against Lawful Authority,</hi> is a Doctrine I never believ'd, neither did I ever teach, or encourage it. My conversation has been always peaceable, free from extreams, and if my strictness of Life, and strongly inculcating of it to others is become a Crime, I wonder to what a pitch of impiety the World will come. As I have been a Son of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I endeavoured (in that Sphere I was) to keep up its Credit and reputation against the wild Opinions of some hot Brain'd people. But I find let a man be never so Orthodox, some people (who make it their business to disparage our reformed Religion) will find somewhat whereby to calumniate and reproach him. I wish this licentious Spirit of malediction may be stopt, otherwise I cannot find but the very foundations of our Church and Religion will totter, and come to Ruines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am sure some would be glad <hi>to see her in the Dust.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly for the other inconsistent foppery's his imputation of <hi>Lechery</hi> and <hi>Treachery,</hi> to pass it over in silence would be the greatest piece of prudence. The great sceptic's of the Age know no more compendious way to affront Religion, than by casting dirt in Face of its Professors; And in their most remarkable abuses they are sure something will stick close, that afterwards may reflect upon a mans reputation, <hi>fortiter calumniare, aliquid haerebit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now after all Sir, I must beg your pardon for this Freedom in molesting you with such ungrateful repetitions; However my design is to satisfy a too credulous World, that those common popular reflections upon me, are the inventions of Malice and revenge. I find other people that make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Figures in the Church, cannot be exempted from unwarrantable reproaches, what with their Quaeries <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No serious person can be secure without being Stigmatiz'd.</p>
            <p>To you therefore I apply my self that by your influence over your acquaintance you may stop that Torrent that seems to carry all before it. This you may please to let the World know that the Dr. (for reasons best known to himself) tho at present retir'd will appear again to the confusion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of such pedantique Calumniators as our insignificant Pamphleteer. I am with all respect and submission,</p>
