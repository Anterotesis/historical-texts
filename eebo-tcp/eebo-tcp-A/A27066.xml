            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT being evidently appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, as in moſt other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſo in our Church-diviſions, that a reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved proſtration to the Authority, and a confident adhaeſion to the opinion of reputed-good men, doth commonly ſeduce the Populace, firſt into Prejudice, then into Parties, and ſo to a tenacious obſtinacy in Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Hereupon one probable way of Reſcue and Remedy is, to propoſe to the wandring People the Documents of one whoſe Authority is great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; Therefore have I
<pb facs="tcp:95019:3"/>
thought on the Oracle Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> who in this Book (<hi>His Defence of the Principles of Love</hi>) is not more <hi>Anteſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanus</hi> than <hi>Eirenarches,</hi> preſcribing very well for Peace and Church-union, as the enſuing Treatiſe, eſpecially the Epiſtle, ſhews. And to anticipate that prejudice and miſtakes which a thing of this nature is very liable to, let no man think it my deſign to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> of Self-contradiction, Inconſiſtency, &amp;c. but that it is meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the conviction of thoſe whom that learned Author calls <hi>Honeſt erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Chriſtians</hi>: and to let the World ſee that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and other Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt Miniſters, do not believe that intrinſick evil and ſinfulneſs to be in Conformity, which their unwary Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers are induced, or rather ſeduced to believe; and that there is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick danger and heinous ſinfulneſs in their ſeparation, than his honeſt er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
<pb facs="tcp:95019:3"/>
Chriſtians do imagine, that the difference between Conformiſts and Non-conformiſts is very ſmall, and (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> tells Mr. <hi>Bagſhaw</hi> in his Defence) that Non-conformiſts do injure Conformiſts and make the Caſe (of Conformity) more odious than it is. And to obviate Objections, let it be noted,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That if here be found any ſmall alteration in words, it is meerly for the ſake of brevity and eaſe in reading, and no other than what doth fairly conſiſt with, and not at all, pervert the ſenſe and meaning of the firſt Author.</p>
            <p>And ſince the renouncing of the Covenant, (which Non-conformiſts call the <hi>great Mountain in the way</hi>) is now removed, if the more peaceable Non-conformiſts have a mind to come into the conforming Churches, here is that in this ſmall Treatiſe will help a little to juſtifie and encourage their
<pb facs="tcp:95019:4"/>
practice in ſo doing. What acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance this poor thing will have, I am ignorant, but not ſollicitous, ſince the teſtimony of my Conſcience is, that it is in vindication of Truth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of a good Cauſe; nor would I fear the ſucceſs much more than I do the acceptance, would the honeſt er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous Chriſtian read it, with as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle partiality and prejudice, as he would if coming from the firſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors hand.</p>

But above all I entreat the dividing Brethren, if they can ſo long lay by their partiality, to judge by this of the reaſons of their ſeparation from thoſe Churches private or parochial, that they differ from in tolerable things. You think it a ſin to communicate in a Church where the Liturgy is uſed, and where Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline is not ſo ſtrictly exerciſed againſt ſome Offenders, as you and I deſire.

               <p>Beſides this, ſays he, in the Apoſtles days there were under Chriſt in the univerſal Church many general Officers, that had the care of governing and overſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Churches up and down, and were fixed by ſtated relation, to none. Such were the Apoſtles, Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, and many of their Helpers in their days. And moſt Chriſtian Churches think, that though the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical, extraordinary Gifts, Priviledges, and Offices ceaſe, yet Government being an ordinary part of their work, the ſame Forms of Government which Chriſt and the Holy Ghoſt did ſettle in the firſt Age, were ſetled for all following Ages, though not with the ſame extraordinary Gifts and Adjuncts.</p>
               <p>Becauſe 1. We read of the ſetling of that Form, <hi>viz.</hi> General Officers as well as Particular, but we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read of any abolition, diſcharge, or ceſſation of the Inſtitution.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If we affirm a Ceſſation without proof, we ſeem to accuſe God of mutability, as ſetling one Form of Government for one Age onely, and no longer.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We leave room for audacious Wits to queſtion other Goſpel-Inſtitutions, as Paſtors, Sacraments, &amp;c. and to ſay, that they were but for an Age onely.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It was general Officers that Chriſt promiſed to be with to the end of the World, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20. Now, ſays he, this will hold good, or not; if not, then this General Miniſtry is to be numbred among humane ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, to be next treated of. If it do, then there is <note n="*" place="margin">Dioceſan Epiſcopacy.</note> another part of the Form of Government (<hi>i.e.</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from that of Presbyters and Deacons) proved to be of <hi>Divine Inſtitution.</hi> I ſay not another Church, but another part of the Government of both Churches univerſal and particular, becauſe ſuch general Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are ſo in the univerſal, as to have a general over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of the particular.

               <p>Now if this be the inſtituted Form of Chriſt's Church-Government, that he himſelf rule abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as General, and that he have ſome general Officers under him, (not any one having the charge of the whole, but in the whole <hi>unfixedly,</hi> or as they volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily part their Provinces) and that each particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church have their own proper Paſtor, one or more; then who can ſay that no Form of Church-Government is of Divine Appointment or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>

                  <hi>That which Non-conformiſts urge for the unlawfulneſs of it, is its being forbidden in the ſecond Commandment, as a tranſient Image, and its being made a Sacrament of the Covenant of Grace; whereas if it were either of theſe, it would be ſo at other times as well as after Baptiſm; for the time or place wherein it is uſed, cannot alter the nature of the thing.

               <p>There are men otherwiſe very honeſt, and truly godly, who think that the Scripture is intended by God, not onely as a general, but a particular Law, or Rule, for all the very circumſtances of Worſhip; and that the ſecond commandment in particular, condemns all that is the invention of men, in or about the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God; and that to deny this, is to deny the perfection of Scripture— I hope the number is but ſmall that are of this opinion. We are obliged to take heed of countenancing this Errour—For if it prevail, what abundance of hurt will it do?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:95019:20"/>1.—2. It draweth men into the dangerous guilt of adding to the Word of God, under <hi>pretence</hi> of ſtrict expounding it, and defending its perfection and extent.</p>
               <p>3.—4. It altereth the very definition of the the holy Scripture, and maketh it another thing. That which God made to be the Record of his holy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and the Law and Rule of Faith and Holineſs, and the general Law for outward modes and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which are but accidents of Worſhip, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by men to be a particular Law, for that which it never particularly medleth with.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If ſorely prepares men for Infidelity, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the divine authority of the Scripture, and utterly to undo all, by over-doing. If Satan could but once make men believe, that the Scripture is a rule for thoſe things which are not to be found in it, and which God never made it to be a rule for. He will next argue againſt it, as a deluſory and imperfect thing— he that believes it to be given as ſuch a particular rule, and then finds that it is ſilent, or utterly inſufficient to that uſe, is like next to caſt it away as a deluſion, and turn an Infidel, or Antiſcripturiſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This miſtake tends to caſt all rational Worſhip out of the Church and the World.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This opinion will bring in all confuſion, inſtead of pure reaſonable Worſhip, while every man is left to find that in Scripture, which never was there, and that, as the onely rule of his actions, one will think that he finds one thing there, and another another thing, for it muſt be reality and verity which muſt be the term of Unity, men cannot agree in that which is not.</p>
               <p n="8">8. It will let in Impiety and Errour, for when men are ſent to ſeek and find that which is not there, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95019:21"/>
man will think that he findeth that which his own corrupted mind brings thither.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And hereby all poſſibility of Union among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and Churches muſt periſh, till this errour periſh; for if we muſt unite onely in that which is not in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we muſt not unite at all.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Hereby is laid a Snare to tempt men into odious cenſures of each other; (of which ſee my Author ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently at large.)</p>
               <p n="11">11. Hereby Chriſtian love will be quenched, when every man muſt account his Brother an Idolater, that cannot ſhew a Scripture for the hour, the place of Worſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. And hereby back-biting, ſlandering, and railing muſt go currant as no ſin, while every <hi>Calvin, Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright, Hilderſham, Perkins, Sibbs, &amp;c.</hi> that uſed a Form of Prayer, yea, all the Chriſtians in the World muſt be accuſed of Idolatry, as if it were a true and righteous charge: And</p>
               <p n="13">13. All our ſins will be fathered on God, as if the ſecond Commandment, and the Scripture-perfection required all this, and taught Children to diſobey their Parents and Maſters, and ſay your Prayers and Catechiſms are Images and Idols, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. It will rack and perplex the Conſciences of all Chriſtians, when I muſt take my ſelf for an Idolater, till I can find a particular Law in Scripture for every Tune, Metre, Tranſlation, Method, Veſture, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, &amp;c. that I uſe in the worſhipping of God; when Conſcience muſt build onely in the Air, and reſt only on a word which never was.</p>
               <p n="15">15. It will have a confounding influence into all the affairs and buſineſs of our lives.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, It will fright poor people from Scripture and Religion, and make Us, our Doctrine and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95019:21"/>
ridiculous in the ſight of all the World.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the conſequences (which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſhews very well at large) of that impracticable and erroneous doctrine of demanding a particular Text of Scripture for the Ceremonies and Circumſtances of Gods worſhip.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> having recited the ſeven ſeveral kinds of falſe Worſhip, acquits the Church of <hi>England</hi> from all, and proves at large (in the Pages here cited) that it is not guilty of falſe Worſhip in any kind or any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation whatſoever, any more than Mr. <hi>Bagſhaw</hi> (whom he there ſpeaks particularly to) or the reſt of the <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> are in their extemporate Prayers.</p>

               <p>To do it (<hi>i.e.</hi> to uſe, as he calls it, an unreformed Liturgy) out of choice, is one thing; to do it as a duty put upon us by Gods providence and our Governours, when we can do no better, is another thing: it is God that hath pulled down our liberty and opportunity to ſerve him better, and we muſt obey him. It is no
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95019:22"/>
faulty mutability to change our practice, when God by changing our condition doth change our duty; no more than it was in <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who profeſſeth that he would worſhip God, as to Forms and Ceremonies, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Church did with which he joined, where-ever he came.</p>

               <p>The Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is ſo ſound, that the Independents and Presbyterians have ſtill of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to ſubſcribe to it, in the 39. Articles.</p>
               <p>Thus hath Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> copiouſly vindicated the Church of <hi>England</hi> in almoſt every point of Conformity which is any thing material; which ſhews that Non-conformiſts themſelves do not really believe what they have ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to, and impoſed upon the belief of their Followers concerning the ſinfulneſs of Conformity.</p>
               <p>And that what they except againſt in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, is not upon the account of its Sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but Inexpediency onely; which neither the Law of God, Nature nor Nations did ever allow the People to be Judges of, but the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95019:22"/>
onely: and therefore ought in point of Chriſtianity and right Religion, to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to, for the ſake of thoſe great Chriſtian duties, Peace, Unity and Obedience to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates; for the conviction of our religious Enemies, for the good and proſperity of the Church, for the ſafety, honour, and welfare of the King and three Kingdoms, for the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of Chriſtianity, and for the glory of God, to whom be glory for ever and ever.</p>
