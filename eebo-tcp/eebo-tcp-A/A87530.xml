            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Muſt confeſſe to you, that I doe appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that there is a Legiſlative Power in the Parliament, but I take it to be <hi>in ſenſu conjuncto,</hi> not <hi>in ſenſu diviſo,</hi> in a ſenſe when the KING is joyned to both Houſes of Parliament, not when he is divided from them either in his Will or Perſon: For neither Houſe by it ſelf, or both Houſes together have Power to make a Law to binde the Subject without the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all aſſent; now the Legiſlative Power is nothing elſe but a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to repeal old Lawes, or to make new ones that ſhall binde the Subject: neither can the KING by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf repeal any eſtabliſhed, or make any Law binding to the ſubject without the preparation or aſſent of both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, not joyning with any one Houſe, make a Law or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance to binde the other, nor repeal any Law whatſoever; and I am very confident, you cannot ſhew me an authority in our Laws to the contaary; But you will peradventure ſay, That the KING will fully abſent himſelf from both his Houſes of Parliament, and that thereupon his Power is inherent in, and devolved to the Parliament. If you ſhould make this objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, beſides what you will finde hereafter expreſſed as touching this queſtion, the practice of all times ſhew the contrary: for as on the one part, if he be perſonally preſent with his Parl. yet he may be wilfully abſent, or abſent in his will, as if he anſwer to

                  </gap>aviſera,</hi> or the King will adviſe upon it, it ſtands at preſent for a negation of the bill, and thereby it is made incapable that Seſſion to be an Act: ſo on the contrary part, if the King be abſent from both Houſes of Parliament in perſon, hee may be preſent in his will; that is, if his perſon were at <hi>York,</hi> and both Houſes ſitting at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and they ſhould ſend him Bills to ſigne which he ſhould accept of, and indorſe this upon them (<hi>Le Roy le Veut</hi>) or the King wills, this is an affirmation of thoſe bills, and makes them Acts of Parliament; which not only proves that one or both Houſes by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have not legiſlative power without the King; (for as to the making of Lawes they have but a preparatory power to frame and preſent bills for the Royall ſignature and approbation) but alſo that if the King bee abſent in perſon from them either willingly or by occaſion of neceſſity, his legiſlative power is not repreſentatively lodged in, or devolved unto one or both Houſes of Parliament. I will agree with that great lover of Parliaments, and learned Father of the Law, Sir <hi>Edward Cooke,</hi> in the fourth part of his Inſtitutes p. 6. <q>That a Parliament cannot begin or be held but either in the Kings perſon or by repreſentation: By re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation two wayes, either by a Guardian of <hi>England</hi> by Letters<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patents under the Great Seale, when the King is <hi>in remotis</hi> out of the Realme, or by commiſſion under the Great Seale to certaine Lords of Parliament repreſenting the Kings perſon, he being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Realme, by reaſon of ſome infirmity;</q> ſo that we hereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the King is not repreſented in Parliament of common courſe, but only by ſpeciall Commiſſion, in one of theſe two cauſes: in the firſt of which caſes, <hi>Edward</hi> Duke of <hi>Cornewall,</hi> and Earle of <hi>Cheſter</hi> held a Parliament in 24. <hi>E.</hi> 3. for King <hi>Edw.</hi> the third: And <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> brother and Lieutenant to the King and Guardian of <hi>England</hi> held a Parliament as Guardian of <hi>England</hi> in the fifth year of King <hi>H.</hi> the fifth; and in the ſecond caſe in 3. <hi>E.</hi> 4. a Parliament was begunne in the preſence of the King, and prorogued untill a further day; And when <hi>William</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>York</hi> the Kings Commiſſary by Letters-patents held the ſame Parliament and adjourned the ſame, the cauſe of the ſaid prorogation being becauſe the King was inforced to goe into <hi>Gloceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> to repreſſe a Rebellion there; ſo in 28. <hi>Eli.</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> by her Commiſſion did by her Letters-patents authoriſe <hi>John Whit gift</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury, William</hi> Baron of <hi>Burleigh</hi> Lord Treaſurer, and <hi>Henry</hi> Earle of <hi>Darby,</hi> to begin, hold, and prorogue a Parliament,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115047:4"/>
and this Commiſſion is entred in the Journall booke of the Lords houſe, over which is written, <hi>Domina Regina repreſentatur per comiſſionarios viz.</hi> That our Lady the Queene is repreſented by her Commiſſioners: <q>which precedents in both caſes plainely prove that the King is not of courſe repreſentatively in Parliament, nor his power lodged there, but by his ſpeciall Commiſſions, or Letters Patents,</q> which may ſuffice as to this point; but for thoſe parts of your motives, that the power of both Houſes is above the Kings, you ſhall find anſwered unto hereafter.</p>
            <p>And whereas you write that the Scots have delivered up the King, and that he is a Priſoner, and his Perſon at their diſpoſition, that the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Parliament are united, that the whole ſtrength of the Kingdome is in their hands, that Biſhops will be rooted out, their Lands ſold, and Presbyterian government ſetled; which I conceive you alledge as argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to perſwade me to compound, and take the Oathes you mention; theſe are rather arguments of force and fraude, by all zealous lovers of honour, Juſtice and Piety to be reſiſted and withſtood, then of truth and reaſon tobe ſubmittd unto, and looke more like arguments of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors Hill, then Weſtminſter Hall; but if you lay them before me, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions of feare and terrour, I anſwer you in the words of King Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, that you may ſee how vaine theſe conceits are, Pſal. 2. <hi>The Princes of the earth ſtand up, and take councell againſt the Lord, and againſt his Anoynted,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Let us breake their bonds aſunder, and caſt away their cords from us, he that dwelleth in Heaven ſhall laugh them to ſcorne, the Lord ſhall have them in deriſion: he ſhall bruiſe them with a Rod of Iron, and breake them in peeces like a Potters Veſſell.

I hope I may without offence ſay, that I beleeve our King is a parallell to David in his vertues, and the juſtice of his Cauſe, and therefore ſhall with David Pſal. 21. conclude this point, <hi>The King ſhall rejoyce in thy ſtrength O Lord, exceeding glad ſhall he be of thy ſalvation, thou ſhalt give him his hearts deſire, and wilt not deny him the requeſt of his lips,</hi> and why? <hi>Becauſe the King putteth his truſt in the Lord, and in the mercy of the moſt higheſt he ſhall not miſcarry:</hi> And for the latter part of your Argument, which is, that either the King will ſigne the Propoſitions, and ſo mine eſtate will be confiſcated, or if he doe not, the Parliament will doe it by their Ordinances without him: I anſwer, that I feare not his Majeſties conſent to give away the eſtates of his Loyall Subjects, but if he be a Priſoner as you ſignifie unto me by your letters that he is, I feare not much that his aſſent to the Propoſitions can take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way mine eſtate; neither doe I hold it a peece of wiſdome to preſſe his conſent <hi>per dures</hi> to ſuch Propoſitions, for you that are learned in the Lawes know that ſuch conſent is not any way binding at all amongſt common perſons, <hi>a fortiori</hi> in the Kings cauſe. And for their diſpoſing of mine eſtate by Ordinance without the Kings conſent, I muſt deale plainely with you, it terrifieth me not at all, for I am cleerely of opinion <q>that no Ordinance without the Kings conſent is binding to the people, or can alter any property that I have in mine eſtate, by the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Lawes of the Land: And if the King ſhould conſent to ſuch an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115047:5"/>
it were onely binding till the firſt Seſſions of the next Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and then to dye of it ſelfe, if not againe revived;</q> which if I thought you doubted of, I would take the paines to cleare it by ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting you authorities ſufficient in the point, whereupon I doubt not but you wil infer that there can be no good aſſurance or ſale made of <q>the Biſhops lands by Ordinance without the Kings Royall and perſonall aſſent, nor that both or either Houſe of Parliament can diſpoſe of his Royall perſon by any Law of the Land (and I hope God will never permit them to diſpoſe of him) otherwiſe then to re-eſtabliſh him in his Throne againe, and inveſt him with all his Royall powers and intereſts, which by the knowne Lawes of the Land are due unto him, and to make him a glorious King accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their ſeverall Declarations, Proteſtations, oaths of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie and Allegiance, and according to their ſolemne League and Covenant; all which Proteſtations, Oaths, and Covenants, every Member of both Houſes, either by the Lawes, or by their owne Orders, hath or ought to take.</q> Now as concerning the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, if I underſtand it aright, the principall ends of it are the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Presbyterian government in the Church, the extirpation of Epiſcopacy, the right and priviledges of Parliament, the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Kings Majeſties perſon and authority, which is quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with a clauſe of equivocation; <hi>viz.</hi> in the maintenance of the true Religion and liberties of the Kingdome, to bring Incendiaries and malignants, or evill inſtruments to condigne puniſhment; and laſtly, to aſſiſt and defend all thoſe that joyn in that League and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, to the ends and purpoſes aforeſaid. Theſe being the ends of the Covenant, it is expedient that I ſhould conſider whether it be lawfull to take any Covenant tending to theſe ends: for I will not diſpute the legality or illegality of taking of Covenants in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, but whether without my King and his confirmation, I may make any Covenant at all with any ſort of people in this Land, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to abrogate any knowne and eſtabliſhed Law of the Land: Now to pull downe that government of Epiſcopacy which is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by divers acts of Parliament in this Kingdome, to ſet up Presbyterian by force of Armes, which is inconſiſtent with the Laws and Statutes of this Realme, and without the Kings conſent (who by his office of divine appointment, is the nurſing father of the Church, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 49. 22. and by the Statutes of this Land acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115047:5"/>
to be ſupreame Moderator and governour of the Church and Kingdome, as hereafter is more at large declared.) I very much doubt and ſcruple, whether I may doe it, and the rather for this cauſe for feare leſt joyning in an unlawfull Covenant, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I be found to fight againſt God, as it was ſaid in the caſe of the Apoſtles, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 30. for if I enter into this Covenant to eradicate Epiſcopacy which hath been approved in the Church for the firſt 1500 yeares after Chriſts aſcention by all men that have profeſſed the name of Chriſt, and was doubtleſſe of Apoſtolicall inſtitution (if we may give credit unto the ancient Fathers, and Chronologies of the Primitive times) and make a League to ſet up Presbyterian government, which was never ſo much as heard of in the Church under that notion (for ought I can read) till the revolt of the Towne of <hi>Genevah</hi> from their obedience unto the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> in the year of our Lord 1535. at which time they tooke occaſion to change their old Religion, and to expell their Biſhops for countenance to their rebellion, and called in <hi>Calvin</hi> a learned man of <hi>France</hi> bred up in the Civill Laws, to be their Moderator in Divinity, whom they after through their inconſtancie baniſhed, and would have had a Biſhop of the reformed Religion if they could have procured conſecration, for want whereof they recalled him againe upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thoughts to perfect their new modell of Church-government, which he there eſtabliſhed as it happened in the yeare of our Lord 1541. as partly by his owne Epiſtles, and more plainly by Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> workes, and by <hi>Franciſcus Boninardus</hi> his writings to a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian Miniſter, and elſewhere appeares; which kinde of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as many learned men are of opinion, is neither of Apoſtolicall inſtitution, nor example, nor agreeable either to the primitive veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or regiment in the Church, nor the true Chriſtian liberty which the Saints of God doe challenge; though I will not deny that there were both Elders and Presbyters in the Church of Chriſt in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles times, yet I take them rather to be a ſubordinate, then a diſtinct degree from the Regiment of Epiſcopacy. And therefore for mee that am not better ſatisfied in the diſcipline of Presbytery, and more perſwaded of the divine right of Epiſcopacy, to take this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, were to act a ſin of preſumption againſt the perſwaſion of my conſcience, wherein I may be ſaid to fight againſt God. As for the preſervation of the Rights and Priviledges of Parliament, God forbid, that I ſhould not both ſweare and covenant to maintaine
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115047:6"/>
them, ſo long as the Houſes move within their Spheare, and ſteere their courſe by the knowne Chanels of the Lawes of England, and launch not out into the maine of Arbitrary Government without ſcale or compaſſe, ſo long I hold my ſelfe obliged with my life and fortune to mainetain them. But whether all thoſe things are priviledges of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament which are now pretended to be ſo, or whether the Houſes move in their proper Orbe, without irregularity or deviation, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a matter of ſtate, which I being abroad cannot take ſo perfect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, I leave it to you, and other learned men who are in England to judge of, it being more proper for you, and thoſe that are upon the place to give a determination of it, then my ſelfe.</p>
            <p>And as touching the preſervation of the Kings Majeſties perſon, I hold it my duty to lay downe my life and fortune for it, either in Active or Paſſive Obedience, without any reſervation or ſuch reſtriction as is aforeſaid whatſoever. And I could wiſh for the worlds better ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, that the Houſes would pleaſe to explaine themſelves, what the Religion and Liberties of the Kingdome are they mean by theſe words (in the preſervation and defence of the true Religion, and Liberties of the Kingdome) And as touching Incendiaries, Malignants, and evill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of all ſorts, I could wiſh they might be tryed by indifferent Judges lawfully conſtituted, and by the knowne eſtabliſhed, Lawes of the Land, and by thoſe Lawes to be brought to condigne puniſhment: But to enter into a Covenant or ſolemne League to defend the perſons of thoſe that ſhall take it in any other ſence, then what I have before expreſſed; I doubt I may not lawfully doe it. Another ſcruple I make, whether this Covenant is not already broken by thoſe that have taken it, in the very Act of reſtraining the Kings Perſon, and by taking away of his Authority from him, and in other points, I will not now inſiſt u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon; if it ſo fall out in truth, that it be already broken, I ought not then to joyne in League and Covenant with thoſe that lifting up their hands to the high God, have ſworne to maintaine and keepe the ſame, and notwithſtanding this their Oath, have falſified their faith to him: with whom if I ſhould joyne my ſelfe, I ſhould ſay with the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Jewes, Hoſea 10. 3. <hi>Wee have no King, becauſe wee feared not the Lord, and what ſhould a King doe to us?</hi> And I ſhould not only doe the ſame which they have done, but ſhould alſo favour them that do them, making my ſelfe worthy of eternall death, with thoſe <hi>Covenant brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> which Saint Paul makes mention of, Rom. 1. 30. 31. And thus much concerning
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115047:6"/>
the Covenant. But truely Sir though I take not upon me to diſpute the lawfulneſſe of the power of both Houſes to impoſe Oathes or Covenants upon the Kings people; yet if I were in England, and this Covenant, or the negative Oath, or any other Oath or Covenant were offered to me by way of impoſition or conſtraint, I doe confeſſe I ſhould make theſe two objections againſt it: the one is that which a wiſe and great Peere of this Realme now ſitting in this preſent Parliament objected againſt that Oath which was offered to be impoſed upon all the Members of the great Counſell at Yorke, to wit, that I may lawfully refuſe to take or ſubmit my ſe fe to any Oath that is not lawfully injoyned mee by Act of Parliament, that is ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and made a Law, with full conſent of the King, Lords, and Commons aſſembled in Parliament. And the other objection I ſhould make is this, That if the King, Lords, and Commons, with full conſent in Parliament, ſhould enact a thing contrary to the Law and word of God, and enjoyne all the Subjects of the Realme to take an oath to obſerve it, I might lawfully, and would refuſe to take that Oath, rather ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting my ſelfe to the puniſhment inflicted for not taking that Oath, then committing ſo high a ſinne of preſumption againſt God and mine owne conſcience, as to ſweare to obſerve a Law which is againſt his Law, and his moſt holy Word and Commandement. For we ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to obey God then man, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 19. 5. 29. And I am fully of this <q>opinion that there ought not to be any other oath impoſed upon the Subjects of this Realme then what is impoſed and enjoyned by act of Parliament, and that only concerning lawfull and indifferent things.</q> And when an oath is offered unto us, ſo conditioned, I am likewiſe of opinion that both my ſelfe, and all other his Majeſties ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are bound to take it and obſerve it.</p>
            <p>Now as concerning the Oath in queſtion, which is the Negative Oath, which runnes in theſe words (<hi>viz.) I. A. B.</hi> doe ſweare from my heart that I will not directly nor indirectly adhere unto, or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly aſſiſt the King in this warre, or in this cauſe againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor any forces raiſed againſt the two Houſes of Parliament in this cauſe or war. And I do likewiſe ſweare that my comming and ſubmitting my ſelfe under the power and protection of the Parliament is without any manner of deſigne whatſoever to the prejudice or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of this preſent Parliament, and without the direction, privity, and advice of the King, or any of his Councell or Officers, other then what I have now made knowne: So helpe me God and the Contents of this book.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:115047:7"/>I am much ſcrupled in my judgement and conſcience whether it be not both againſt the Law and word of God, againſt the Law of Nature, againſt the ſetled, knowne, eſtabliſhed, and unrepealed Laws of this Kingdome; againſt the Law of reaſon, and againſt all reaſon, conſcience, honour, and pollicy, either to take it or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it.</p>

               </gap>y to my King, which by the Law and Word of God I am enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to diſcharge towards him, <hi>By me Kings reigne,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 15. therefore I cannot doubt of the lawfulneſſe of their calling, and that they are of divine right and inſtitution, the bleſſed Spirit of God ſpeaking in <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 24. 2. <hi>Solomon</hi> exhorts his ſonne, <q>that is, every childe of God in theſe words, My ſonne feare God and the King, and meddle not with them that are given to change; or as ſome Tranſlations have it, that are ſeditious:</q> Here the Holy Ghoſt joynes God and the King under one feare, or under one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, as if hee ſhould ſay, to feare the King, is to feare God; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe thou feareſt the King, thou canſt not feare God, this is no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound or improper inference; for it is the will of God that thou ſhouldeſt feare the King, wich will, if thou performe not, thou canſt not be ſaid to feare God. Now feare in this place is only taken for ſubjection and obedience, and this duty of thy obedience and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, is as properly belonging unto the King, as thy feare is to God, which our moſt bleſſed Saviour Jeſus Chriſt expreſly declareth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 23. in theſe words, <q>Give unto Caeſar thoſe things that are Caeſars, and to God thoſe things that are Gods;</q> and though the queſtion were there only concerning Tribute, and asked of the Phariſees and Herodians which were not naturall ſubjects to Ceſar, but onely brought under by conqueſt and force, yet our Saviour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts the Jewes and Herodians to performe ſubjection to Caeſar in paying the tribute due to him, as well as to perform their duties to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God: which ſaying of his, (though the wicked Jews thought to entrap him by the queſtion) yet could they not reprove it before the people, becauſe they were convinced of the truth of it by the light of nature, having not faith to perceive the divine right, that was couched in it, and therefore they marvelled at his anſwer, and held their peace, as it is recorded, <hi>Luke</hi> 20. 26. And though our bleſſed Saviour might have challenged an exemption from the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115047:7"/>
of tribute, as being free, yet becauſe he would not offend <hi>Caeſar,</hi> he cauſed <hi>Peter</hi> to pay tribute for them both, as we may read <hi>Math.</hi> 7. 26. 27. St. <hi>Peter</hi> writing unto the ſtrangers that dwelt in <hi>Pontus, Gallatia, Cappadocia, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Bithynia,</hi> who were at that time under the dominion of the Roman Empire only by reaſon of their aboad, and ſo owed but locall allegiance to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> exhorts them that they ſhould ſubmit themſelves unto all manner of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of man, for the Lords ſake, whether it be unto the King as unto the ſuperiour, or unto governours, as unto thoſe that are ſent of him, for the puniſhment of evill doers, and for the praiſe of them that do wel, for ſo is the will of God that by weldoing ye may put to ſilence the ignorance of the fooliſh men. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 15. where we are to underſtand by the way, that according to the Geneva notes upon that place, by this word, ordinance, is meant the framing and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Civill government, which the Apoſtle calleth the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of men, not becauſe men invented it, but becauſe it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to men to exerciſe, upon which place of the Apoſtle, there are theſe things obſervable. <q>Firſt, that wee ought to ſubmit to the King as ſuperiour. Secondly, that where a government is Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall, as in <hi>England,</hi> governours are ſent by him, and by him only: for if governours had been to have been ſent by any other, the Apoſtle writing by the Spirit of God, if their calling had been lawfull, would not have omitted to have inſtructed thoſe ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to performe ſubjection and obedience to them. Thirdly, that it is the will of God that wee ſhould ſubmit our ſelves to the King as ſuperiour. Fourthly, That in ſo doing wee doe well. And fifthly, That in doing this well, we ſhall put to ſilence the ignorance of the fooliſh men; that is to ſay, of ſuch, who hold that ſubjection and obedience belongs not to Kings, or ſuch that ſeeke to withdraw us from ours;</q> wherefore as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 5. we muſt be ſubject, not becauſe of wrath only, (or for feare of puniſhment) but alſo for conſcience ſake; for this cauſe wee ought to pay tribute to whom wee owe our tribute, cuſtome to whom cuſtome, feare to whom feare, honour to whom honour is due; in which words St. <hi>Paul</hi> coupleth together the whole duty of ſubjection and obedience which we owe to our King, tribute, feare, and honour; where, in the firſt place, we are to conſider that St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote thoſe precepts to men as free in Chriſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115047:8"/>
as our ſelves, and to Romans, men of as much learning, courage, and warlike imployments, as were any at that time, or ſince in the world, and men who not long before were brought from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of a popular ſtate, to the obedience of a ſole and ſovereigne Monarchy: neither muſt we forget that theſe percepts were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the time of that heathen Emperour <hi>Nero,</hi> which then ruled o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Romans, and the moſt bloody tyrannous and perſecuting Tyrant and enemy to the Church of Chriſt that ever was before or ſince his time: And yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells thoſe Chriſtian Romans, they muſt be ſubject for conſcience ſake, and his doctrine was true, and not without warrant from Gods owne mouth; for let a King be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo wicked, yet he is Gods ordinance upon us, and being Gods Ordinance we are to obey him, by his eſpeciall commandement; <hi>Ieroboam</hi> was a wicked Prince and an Idolater, and cauſed Iſrael to fall away from God, and to ſacrifice to Idolls, yet we finde that God ſent <hi>Ahijab</hi> the Prophet unto him with this meſſage, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14. 7. Goe tell Jeroboam, for as much as I have exalted thee from among the people, and made thee Prince over my people Iſraell; and God ſent Jehu with the like meſſage unto <hi>Baaſha,</hi> as we read 1 of <hi>Kings</hi> 26. 2. And we read of <hi>Syrus</hi> the Aſſyrian heathen Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 44. 28. where God ſaith of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> He is my ſhepherd, and ſhall performe all my pleaſure, and the 45 1. Thus ſaith the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus, whoſe right hand I have holden to ſubdue Nations before him; and verſe the 5. of the ſame Chapter, I am the Lord, and there is none elſe, there is no God beſides me, I guided thee, though thou haſt not knowne me. God alſo calleth <hi>Nabuchaduezar</hi> that wicked, Idolatrons perſecuting heathen King of Babylon, his ſervant no leſſe then three times in holy writ, as we read <hi>Ier.</hi> 25. 9. 27. 16. and 43. 10. which ſeverall places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture doe clearly evidence to me, that be the Prince or King never ſo wicked or Idolatrous, be he never ſo unjuſt; nay be he Pagan or Infidell, God acknowledged them to be his owne ordinance upon his people; nay, and more, commands his people to yeeld obedience to them as his ordinance, upon paine not only of temporall deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but of everlaſting condemnation, and this is proved unto us by that command of God given to his choſen people the Jewes, Jer. 27. 12. <hi>Bring your neck under the yoke of the King of Babylon, and ſerve him and live, why will you dye thou and thy people by the ſword, by</hi>

            <p>But if it be objected, that theſe generall precepts inforce no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this particular caſe of the Negative Oath.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, they doe very pregnantly, for the words of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Oath are theſe, <hi>I. A. B.</hi> doe ſweare from mine heart that I will not directly, nor indirectly adhere unto, or willingly aſſiſt the

King in this War, or in this Cauſe againſt the Parliament: In which words there is an inhibition of that duty to my King, which by Gods Law and his holy Word I am enjoyned to performe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him: and if I ſweare this oath, I reſtraine my ſelfe thereby in part of that ſubjection and obedience which is due from mee to my Sovereigne; for it doth not appeare by the Scriptures afore mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, nor by any other that I know, that there is any caſe whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever excepted, wherein I ought not to pay tribute, cuſtome, feare, or honour to my King; But in this caſe I engage my ſelfe by mine oath not to adhere, or willingly aſſiſt the King in this Warre, or in this Cauſe againſt the Parliament; which is as much to ſay, as I ſhall not pay him that is due to him by the Law of God and injunction of the Scriptures: If it bee objected that the Scripture bindes mee not to aſſiſt the King, or adhere unto him in matter of War: I anſwer, it doth, though not in direct words, yet in full effect and ſubſtance: for within the precept of Peter 2. 17. <hi>Feare God, honour the King,</hi> And by the firſt Commandement of the ſecond Table, honor thy father and thy mother is included all manner of aid and aſſiſtance due to a King both in warre and peace, which I prove thus: The <hi>Geneva</hi> notes, which I follow in the interpretation of Scriptures being moſt authenticall of any in theſe times of Reformation, commenting upon the 20 <hi>Ezek.</hi> 12. on theſe words, <hi>Honour thy father and thy mother,</hi> expreſſe that by the parents alſo is meant all that have authority over us, wherein the King is included: and upon the 5 Chapt. of Deut. 16. verſe upon the ſame words, gloſſe thus; not for ſhew, but with true obedience, and with due reverence; and upon the 15. Chap. of <hi>Matth.</hi> and 4. verſe, where our bleſſed Saviour reproves the Jewes for not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this Commandement by offering their Corban, which in their caſe was much like this Negative Oath in ours, ſaith thus unto them: <hi>Honour thy father and thy mother, and he that curſeth father or mother, let him dye the death; but yee ſay, whoſoever ſhall ſay to father or mother by the gift that is offered by me, thou maieſt have profit, though he honour not his father or mother ſhall be free, thus have you made the Commandement of God of none effect by your traditions: O hypocrites, Eſaiah well propheſied of you ſaying, This people draweth neare unto mee with their mouth, and honour me with their lips, but their heart is farre from me, but in vaine they worſhip me, teaching for doctrine mens precepts.</hi>

This Negative Oath, which would abſolve us from our duty of ſubjection &amp; obedience to our King, as if this oath were to his profit. If we ſhould not aid him or aſſiſt him, where is our feare, where is our honour, where is our tribute, where is our ſubjection? ſhall we take upon us where the Scriptures enjoynes us duties in generall? to ſay, the Scriptures requires not this or that particular at our hands, where thoſe particulars included are in the generall.</p>
            <p>But here it may be objected, that the Kings warre againſt the Parliament is unlawfull, and the Scriptures binde me not to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of any unlawfull thing, therefore I may ſafely take this oath: To this I anſwer, I will not take upon me to determine the queſtion of the lawfulneſſe or unlawfulneſſe of the Warre, but leave that to the judgement of God Almighty, who will one day determine on which ſide the juſtice of this War doth remaine: but this I know, that it is lawfull for the King being invaded, to defend himſelfe, and that his ſubjects in ſuch a eaſe are bound to aſſiſt him: And if I bee perſwaded in my conſcience, that the right of this war is on the Kings ſide, I am bound to aſſiſt him in it, whether the right be with him or not: And this alſo I know, that the head is over the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and not the members over the head; and that I alſo, and all his other ſubjects ought to performe, if not active, yet paſſive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience

to him in all cauſes, at all times, and in all places whatſoever. Furthermore, the Prophet <hi>Jer.</hi> ſaith, Jerem, 4. 2. Thou ſhalt ſweare in truth, in judgement, and in righteouſneſſe, <q>Every oath ought to have theſe three ſpeciall quallities, it ought to be made in truth, in judgement, and in juſtice, whereunto is oppoſed falſehood, raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and unlawfulneſſe; ſo that if the Negative Oath have any defect in any of theſe three particulars, we are to lay it aſide, and not to take it as being unlawfull: The nature of an oath is as a bond, for God himſelfe declares, Numb. 30. 3. He that ſweareth an oath, and by it bindeth his ſoule, with a bond ſhall not violate his word, but doe according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth,</q> which is as much to ſay that he ſhall not take the name of God in vaine; ſo that hereby I am bound if I take this Oath to performe it according to the letter, and not to evade it by ſaying, I take it in mine owne ſenſe with a mentall reſervation, but I muſt doe it according to all that proceedeth out of my mouth, &amp; if ſo, then do I abſolutely ſwear againſt that duty that I am enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to by the Scriptures, for I ſweare not to adhere to, or aſſiſt the K. in this War or this Cauſe, directly or indirectly, ſo that I may nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aid him in word or deed, nay not ſo much as pray for his health or ſucceſſe, nor for the ſafety of his perſon, that under him we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſſe and honeſty; though the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts us in 1 Tim. 2. 2. to pray for Kings to that purpoſe: Nay, by mine oath I am obliged, if I meane to keep it, to ſtand by, and ſee any ſouldier in the Parliaments Army to kill him, and may not aſſiſt him to reſcue his life; wherefore if I doe obſerve this Oath, I take it not in truth, but to an unjuſt and unlawfull end, and therefore take it not in juſtice and righteouſneſſe. Secondly, if I underſtand not what uſe may be made of this oath, or what I ſhall be inforced to by it, I take it not in judgement but raſhly and unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſedly, and therein commit a grievous ſinne. Now I know not, as this Oath is penned, what interpretation may be made of it, for if I take it, I ſweare that I will not directly nor indirectly adhere unto, or willingly aſſiſt the King in this Warre or in this Cauſe againſt the Parliament, nor any forces raiſed againſt th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t wo Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Cauſe or War. Firſt, I know what will be interpreted an indirect adhering to the King, or aſſiſting of him. Secondly, I know not what is meant by this Cauſe, or how far it may be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115047:10"/>
Thirdly, I know not in what ſenſe they take theſe words againſt the Parliament, whether they include the perſon of the King within the word Parliament, or his power only excluding his perſon: neither doe I underſtand what is meant by any forces raiſed againſt the two Houſes of Parliament, there being now no ſuch forces in the Kingdome, and the War at an end; therefore underſtanding not the extent of theſe particulers, I ſweare raſhly, and therein commit a ſinne of preſumption if I take it: And laſtly, if I take this oath, I ſweare to an unjuſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull end; for I ſweare to withdraw mine obedience, ſubjection and allegiance from him, which is an unjuſt and unlawfull thing, and to an ill end, the ſame being due unto him by the Law of God, as before is declared by the Law of nature, the Law of the land, and the law of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as hereafter ſhall be proved.</p>
            <p>To conclude this point, in taking of Oaths we ought to take heed, that we obſerve theſe rules of the learned Fathers, that is, as to Oaths which we take voluntarily, and not by coertion, or by any impulſive ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity: <q>

ſame is common to all living creatures, as well to birds as to thoſe which the Land &amp; the Sea produceth; and agreeable to this is the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law of Nature, ſet downe by learned and reverend <hi>Hooker,</hi> in his firſt booke of Eccleſiaſticall pollicie, whereby he calls it, <q>That manner of working which God hath ſet for each created thing to keep, he being a director of infinit knowledge, to guide nature in her wayes:</q> But I meane not that this Negative Oath is againſt this generall Law of nature, but there is a more ſpeciall Law of nature proper to mankinde only, which will ſteere us to the queſtion in hand: which ſpeciall Law of nature proper to men, St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his Epiſtle <hi>ad Hil.</hi> 89. <hi>&amp; in Evangelium Johanes</hi> Tract. 49. defines thus, <q>
                  <hi>Lex naturalis eſt impreſſio divini luminis, in nobis &amp; participatio legis aternae in rationali Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura:</hi> The Law naturall, ſaith he, is the impreſſion of divine light in us, and a participation of the eternall Law in the reaſonable creatures,</q> which diſtinction is ſtrengthened by that expoſtulation which <hi>Moſes</hi> makes in the perſon of God with <hi>Cain,</hi> before any Law written, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 7. If thou doſt well ſhalt thou not be accepted, &amp; if thou doſt not well, ſin lyeth at the doore? for ſo is the Law of nature imparted unto us by il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination of the Law eternall: that this is moſt cleare, St. <hi>Paul</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth unto us, <hi>Rom</hi> 2. 15. 14. For when the Gentiles (ſaith hee) which have not the Law, doe by nature the things contained in the Law, theſe having not the Law, are a law unto themſelves; which ſhew the works of the Law written in their hearts, their conſcience alſo bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring witneſſe, and their thoughts mean while excuſing or accuſing them; what other thing was this, but the Law of nature, or the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of divine light in the hearts of the Gentiles? which doctrine of St. <hi>Paul</hi> reproves the opinion of thoſe, who thinke that whatſoever proceedes of nature is ſinne, for if ſo it were, that whatſoever proceeds of nature is ſinfull, how could the conſciences of the Gentiles bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for them, or excuſe them of the breach of the Law? Therefore St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his third booke <hi>de doctrina Chriſtiana, Cap.</hi> 14 ſaith, <q>
                  <hi>Omne vitium naturae nocet, ac per hoc contra naturam eſt,</hi> every vice doth wrong to nature, and is therefore contrary to it;</q> and in his 12. booke <hi>de Civitate Dei, Cap.</hi> 1. he ſaith, <q>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115047:11"/>
to that which is contrary to nature:</q> Nature therefore is Gods inſtrument, and none other is her guide, but only the God of nature: for as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid in his Sermon at<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Athens when he found an altar dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the unknown God, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 28. in him we live, and move, &amp; have our being, being alſo of his off-ſpring as he told them: their owne Poets ſaid, whereby it is clearly proved, that though the Athenians being Gentiles, and aſcribing the being of all things to the Law and courſe of nature; yet St. Paul could finde out another hand in thoſe workes beſides nature, to whom nature was only ſubſervient, and an handmaid to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey his eternall Law, decree, and purpoſe according to that order hee hath ſet downe for the ſonnes of men for ever to bee obſerved. This ſhort digreſſion I have made only to take away this objection that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny make, That we are not bound to obſerve the Lawes of nature, and alſo to let them know that the Law of nature is to bee obſerved, and that as being a participation of the eternal Law, it is both perpetuall and unalterable, and not preſumptuouſly to be violated: The conſideration whereof moved <hi>Pythagoras</hi> the heathen Philoſopher to publiſh amongſt his golden precepts, this one, <q>
                  <hi>nil turpe committas, neque coram aliis, neque tecum maxime omnium, verere teipſum,</hi> commit nothing foule or diſhoneſt, ſaith he, neither to be known to others, nor to thine own heart, but above all things, reverence thine owne conſcience:</q> but to draw ſomewhat nearer to the thing in purpoſe, and to prove that this Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Oath, is againſt the Law of nature, I muſt obſerve with <hi>Hooker,</hi> that as there is a Law naturall belonging to men, as they are men in their kinde, which Law directeth them in the means whereby they are to ſteere their actions as to their owne particular preſervations, ſo there is a Law naturall which toucheth them as ſociable parts united into one body, a Law which bindeth them to ſerve unto each others good, and all to preſerve the good of the whole, before whatſoever their owne particular, and from both thoſe roots or branches of the Law of nature, ſprings the allegiance, ſubjection and loyall obedience, which is due from a ſubject unto his King, from this ſpeciall Law of nature? Man by the impreſſion of divine light is bound to obſerve the Law naturall, as it is written in his heart, and is part of the Law eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall by which we are bound to obey, and ſuccour, and aſſiſt our Parents, whether our naturall parents, or the parents of our Country; and from this relative Law of nature, as I may ſo call it, or the Covenant of nature whereby we are bound as ſociable parts by the Law of nature united

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115047:22"/>
judgement I doe thereby incurre the crime of perjury by the law, in falſifying my faith and Allegiance to his Majeſty King <hi>Charles,</hi> Gods anointed, and crowned my naturall liege Lord, ſovereigne, and my lawfull King, both by deſcent, Coronation, inveſture, and undoubted right, which is not onely due to him by the Law of the Land from every of his ſubjects, but every one of them is to take this following Oath for performance of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Viz.</hi> You ſhall ſweare that from this day forwards you ſhall be true and faithfull to our Sovereigne Lord King <hi>Charles,</hi> and his heyres, and faith and truth ſhall beare to him of life and member and terrene honour, and you ſhall neither know nor heare of any ill or dammage intended unto him, that you ſhall not defend, ſo helpe me Almighty God. Which forme of Oath every Subject by the Common Law is bound to take, as appeares by <hi>Britton 5. Edw. 1. cap.</hi> 24. And by <hi>Andrew Horne</hi> in the Mirrour of Juſtices, <hi>pag.</hi> 226. and in <hi>Calvins</hi> caſe as by peruſall of their Bookes will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, and by diverſe others which for brevities ſake I omit.</p>
            <p>And now Sir, I deſire to know your opinion likewiſe, whether that by the Common Law, both houſes of Parliament are in power above the King, or where their legall power to diſpoſe of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties perſon, other then to his honour and good, according to their duty, Oathes, Proteſtations, Covenants, and Declarations, and obedience is to be found.</p>
            <p>I come now to prove that this Oath is againſt the Law of reaſon, the Law of reaſon ſaith Doctor and Student, <hi>cap.</hi> 2. is written in <q>the hearts of every man, teaching him what is to be done, and what is to be fled: And becauſe it is written in the heart, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may not be put away, nor is it ever changable by any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of place or time; and therefore againſt this Law, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, ſtatutes, or cuſtomes may not prevaile; and if any be brought in againſt it, they be no preſcriptions, ſtatutes, nor cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, but things done againſt juſtice and voyd; and in this it differeth from the Law of God, for that the Law of God is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by Revelation from God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Almighty, and this Law is given by a naturall light of underſtanding, and is given principally to direct our actions by, for the obtaining of felicity in this life, ſo us we guide them onely by the rule of Juſtice: This Law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th us, ſaith the ſame Author, that good is to be done, and

evill is to be avoided, that thou ſhouldeſt do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to another, that which thou wouldeſt another ſhould doe to thee:</q> That juſtice is to be done to every man and not wrong: that a treſpaſſe is to be puniſhed &amp; ſuch like: Is it ſo then, that the law of reaſon directs me that good is to be done, and evill is to be avoyded? I then conclude that this oath is againſt this Law; for if I by this Oath ſhall withdraw mine Allegiance and ſubjection to my King from him, I loſe the benefit or good I ſhould have by his protection: for the rule in Law is, <q>
                  <hi>Quod Subjectio tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hit protectionem, quia Rex ad tutelam Legis corporum &amp; bonorum e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectus eſt</hi> as <hi>Forteſcue lib. de laudibus legum Angliae, c.</hi> 13. Obedience of the Subject drawes protectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the King, the King being ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the defence of the Law, &amp; the bodies, &amp; goods of his Subjects.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The holy Scriptures informe me, that I muſt obey my King <hi>for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake,</hi> and this Law teacheth me, I muſt avoid evill; but it is evill for me to obey men in taking this Negative Oath which enjoynes me not to obey my King, rather then God, who enjoynes that duty of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, therefore I conclude that this Oath is againſt the Law of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. This Law teacheth me to doe as I would men ſhould doe unto me, but if I were a King I would not be diſpoyled of the duty and ſervice of my Subjects; therefore this Oath enjoynes me to a thing againſt the Law of reaſon: <q>It is injuſtice and wrong to take away the Kings right by this Law;</q> but this Oath bindes me to take away his right and doe him wrong, therefore in this particular alſo this Oath is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Law of reaſon. And laſtly this Law of reaſon teacheth me, a Treſpaſſer is to be puniſhed, it teacheth me alſo to underſtand that to take this Oath is to treſpaſſe upon my Kings intereſt in me as I am his Subject; to treſpaſſe upon his Lawes as I am <hi>de jure</hi> under his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to treſpaſſe upon his patience and goodneſſe, if he doe not hereafter puniſh me for it: Therefore I conclude this Oath is againſt the Law of reaſon. The Law of reaſon generally taken, is <q>
                  <hi>a directive Rule unto goodneſſe</hi>
               </q> of operation, ſaith <hi>Hooker:</hi> ſo that by this Law wee ought to direct all our actions to a a good end, but by taking this Oath I direct not my actions to a good end; therefore I am not to take this Oath by this Law: <q>the Law of reaſon ſaith <hi>Sophocles</hi> is ſuch that being propoſed, no man can reject it as unjuſt and unreaſonable,</q> but the King may reject this manner of impoſing of Oathes upon his Subjects whereby he isdeprived of their aid and aſſiſtance without his aſſent: And the Subjects may reject this Oath as unreaſonable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt; becauſe if they take it, they are thereby bound either to breake
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115047:23"/>
their Oath, which is a grievous ſin, or to loſe the benefit of protection, which by the Lawes they may claime, and ought to have from their naturall lawfull and ſovereigne Liege Lord, and King; Therefore this Oath is againſt the Law of Reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Laſtly, whereas the Law of Reaſon is never changeable by any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of place or time,</q> and whereas mine Allegiance is due to my Sovereigne in all places, in all caſes, and at all times, I am forbidden by this unchangeable Law, to change ſo unchangeable and unalterable a duty by ſuch an unwarrantable Oath in theſe changeable times. To conclude all in this point, as it is againſt reaſon to take this Oath; <q>ſo it is againſt reaſon to require it of me, for it is moſt unreaſonable to offer any Chriſtian man ſuch an Oath as that by taking of it, he muſt by perjury, and ſin of preſumption (as he is perſwaded) deſtroy his ſoule, or by refuſing of it, becauſe it is againſt his conſcience to take it, either by perpetuall impriſonment or ſtarving, deſtroy his body and eſtate.</q> And it is likewiſe moſt unreaſonable for any men to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this Oath to another that have not taken it themſelves: for by the rule of the civill Law, <hi>l. in Aren.</hi>

Is it ſo then that an Oath is and ought to bee the end of ſtrife? Is it ſo that God puniſheth the violation of Oathes, and that the greateſt power on earth cannot protect a man againſt him, I learne then by the rule of a well informed conſcience to diſcerne, that I ought not to breake my Oathes lawfully taken upon any grounds or pretence whatſoever: Nay by this Oath I finde that if I take it I ſhould in ſtead of an end of ſtrife in my conſcience, incur great vexation, through the horrour of the ſinn, as being an act un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, and becauſe by it, I have offended God in the breaking my former Oathes lawfully taken, I ſhould raiſe ſtrife and trouble in my ſoule and conſcience, and great ſtrife and perturbation of minde for feare of puniſhment.

And laſtly, there is no pollicy in preſſing this oath upon any, for the Parliament gaines no ſecurity by taking it, for I thinke very few of the Kings party hold that Oath lawfull, and then what ſecurity to the Parliament in it, ſince no other thing can be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him of the performance of an oath given unto him, that <q>either doubts the power unlawfull that adminiſtred it, or that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115047:26"/>
holds the matter or thing he is bound to performe by his oath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, that then he will keep ſuch an oath no longer then till the firſt time he hath occaſion or oppertunity to breake it; Nay the ſame Religion or new light that hath taught him to break the Kings Oath will or may teach him to break the Parliaments.</q>
