         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, againe the Axe is deſtructive, Trees are cut down by Axes and great woods. The Lord by His Judgements cuts down Kingdomes and Princes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 5. <hi>In the day of thy wrath thou ſhalt ſmite through Kings;</hi> God ſhall not only ſmite, but he ſhall ſmite through Kings: an Axe cuts, and cuts through; and Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments cut through the greateſt and throws them down, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. 21. Gods Judgements are ſore ones, the Sword, Famine, Plague, noyſome Beaſt, they are His ſore Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to hew down People and Kingdomes; hence it is that God is called a <hi>conſuming fire,</hi> not that He is ſo in his owne nature, for he is nothing but <hi>love</hi> and <hi>delight:</hi> but when He ſends out his ſore Judgements, then GOD is <hi>fire,</hi> and will be everlaſting burning to the wicked.</p>
            <p>The next thing to open in the words is, what is meant by the <hi>Tree,</hi> and the <hi>Root</hi> of it. By <hi>Tree,</hi> we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Jewiſh ſtate principally, they were called Gods <hi>pleaſant plant, Iſa.</hi> 5. 7. God had digged, dung'd,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:112339:6"/>
watered, and ſhined upon, and done much for them; they were a great and goodly Tree: but now the Lord layes the Axe to the Root of this Tree; and if God cut downe this Tree, his pleaſant Tree, then no State, no Family, might ever after look to find Mercy, that was in the condition of this Tree, <hi>Every tree that bringeth not forth fruit is hewen down, and caſt into the fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>Root</hi> of the <hi>Tree,</hi> ſome make Man the Tree, the life of Man the Root of it; the <hi>Axe</hi> to be the ſentence of Death, and Death it ſelfe the cutting down of the Tree. Others make the Root of the Tree to be whatever they built moſt upon, and confided in: they built upon their Temple, Greatneſſe, Strength, Chariots Horſes and ſuch things. But I ſhall commend to you theſe 4. things, wherin the Root of the Tree did mainly conſiſt.</p>
            <p>The Firſt was that Covenant which they had with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> God they were the Lords People, and he was their God; and this was one Root which afforded much ſap to this Tree; God being theirs in Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He protected them, provided for them, and did wonderfull things among them. Now the laying the Axe to the Root, was the breaking His Covenant with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Zach.</hi> 11. 10. &amp; 14 v. there is the ſtaffe of beauty, and bands; ſaith God, <hi>I tooke my ſtaffe, Beauty, and cut it aſunder, that I might breake my Covenant with all the people;</hi> and when God had broken that, it was not long before He brake that other ſtaffe of Bands, <hi>viz.</hi> the brotherhood between <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Iudah,</hi> the ten Tribes were diſperſed before: but they had ſome communion with <hi>Iudah</hi> at <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> but God would break the ſtaffe of Bands, he would diſperſe them at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and ſo there ſhould be no communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> for the future. The Covenant being diſſolv'd they were wounded at the Root, and were no longer Gods people.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by Root is meant the true Religion, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> worſhip that the Jewes had, theſe are the root of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.

Sixtly obſerve, That after warning, and waiting, God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> will deale ſeverely with Kingdomes and Perſons. Now the Axe is laid to the Root of the Tree, I have warned you long, and waited long, and I ſee no good fruit, now therefore I intend to cut down the Tree by the Root. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 14, 15. <hi>I have been ſilent a long time, and held my peace, and refrained, and ſaid nothing, but now I will cry like a Woman in Travell, I will deſtroy, and devoure at once ſaith GOD, I will ſtay no longer, I will lay waſt Mountaines, and hills, I will dry no Rivers and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This ſeverity appeares in three particulars: Firſt, in that it is an Axe, is uſed. Secondly, it is the Root it's laid too. Thirdly, in the impartialneſſe, the root of every Tree. Firſt, it is an Axe not <hi>Culter putatorius,</hi> a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> knife, that will cut down ſome little Branches, and no more; it is not <hi>Falx</hi> a Bill or Hooke, to chop off ſome Armes or Bowes, but <hi>ſecuris,</hi> an Axe, ſome ſharp, ſtrong, hewing, deſtroying Judgement. Secondly, It's <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> layd to the Root, not to the branches bowes, not to the great Armes; not to the toppe, not to the Trunck<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to the Root of the Tree is the Axe laid. God will deale roundly with them. Now the Lord would un-covenant them, un-church them, unpower them, and un-ſaint them. Here it's inquirable.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> What makes God to lay the Axe to the Root of a Tree or Kingdome?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> There are 4 things make the Gardener, and ſo God, to lay the Axe to the Root of a Tree. Firſt, Deadneſſe. Secondly, Rottenneſſe. Thirdly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Barrenneſſe, Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Evill fruitfulneſſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Deadneſſe: When the Tree is dying or dead, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the Gardener layes his Axe to the Root of it, and God when a State is dying or dead, layes his Judgements to the root of it. 13 <hi>Hoſea</hi> 1. When <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſinned in <hi>Baal</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:112339:15"/>
then he died. <hi>Ephraims</hi> death being pronounc'd, Gods Axe was preſently prepared, v. 3. <hi>Therefore they ſhall be as the morning Cloud, &amp;c. God</hi> would ſcatter them as Clouds, Chaffe, Smoake, and dry them up as dewe. <hi>Sardis</hi> one of the 7 Churches in <hi>Aſia,</hi> had a name to live but was dead, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 1.

Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what thou haſt received and heard hold faſt, repent, watch, elſe I will come on thee as a thiefe in the night, v.</hi> 3. that is, ſuddenly and cut thee downe: and you know that <hi>God</hi> did lay waſt that and the other Churches not long after; when Churches or Kingdomes are dying or dead, the Axe is not far from the Root of them.</p>

Secondly, Rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or corruption, that makes the Axe to be laid to the Root of the Tree; the Gardner cannot endure to ſee a Tree rotten at the heart, though the bowes be greene, and it beare ſome ſmall fruit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet if rotten<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he will down with it, 6. <hi>Gen.</hi> 12 <hi>All fleſh hath corrupted their way, and the end of all is come before me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have looked upon all fleſh, and finde that great and ſmall have corrupted their way, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the end of all is come before me, I am reſolved to ſend a Flood to drowne the World and its corruptions together.</hi> It was not ſome particular corruption among them, but an univerſall one. There was corruption in faith and life, in their Religion, Worſhip, and manners, and when a State is generally corrupt in thoſe, the Heavens grow black, and either a flood or fire comes, a flood to the old world, a fire to <hi>Sodom.</hi> Trees naturall or politicall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rotten, call for the Axe, and God haſtens it to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Root. Thirdly, Barrenneſſe makes the Axe to be laid to the Root of a Kingdome. 13 <hi>Luk</hi> 7. <hi>I came and found
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:112339:15"/>
no fruit, cut it down why cumbreth it the ground:</hi> a barren Tree cumbers the ground. Some obſerve, that if the <note place="margin">Alapide.</note>Fig-tree beare not fruit in three yeares, it will never beare fruit, and therefore it's ſaid, this 3. yeeres I come ſeeking fruit and finde none, cut it downe. A Barren Tree muſt be cut down. <hi>God</hi> waited long on them when under the Judges, under the Kings, when under the High Prieſts after their captivity, in <hi>Moſes</hi> dayes, in the Prophets, in Chriſts, and ſtill they were barren, therefore downe they muſt.

But you know how <hi>Ioab</hi> dealt with <hi>Abſolom, v.</hi> 14. he thruſt him thrice through the heart while hee was alive in the midſt of the Oake, hee made ſure work and prevented future commotions in the Kingdome. You are caught in an Ordinance this day of Prayer and Faſting, it's our aime and deſire to ſtrike through the heart of your luſts by the darts of divine truth, that for the future there may be no commotions in your ſoules. O ſuffer us to doe it and helpe on the worke, for it lyeth moſt in your hands. You know what luſts are ſtrong and living in you, ſet upon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſpare them not. It was an Argument of wickedneſſe in <hi>Saul</hi> that he ſpared <hi>Agag,</hi> of righteouſneſſe in <hi>Samuel</hi> in that he hewed him to pieces; if you ſpare your luſts, your great and fat ones, it will be an Argument of your wickedneſſe, but if you hew them in pieces and make a generall ſlaughter of them, it will be an Argument of your righteouſnes, and may produce the good and ſafety of the whole Kingdome. I beſeech you therefore in the name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſpare not one <hi>Achan,</hi> one luſt, that one may be the ruine of all, one ſinner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes much good, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 18. and any ſinne may hinder much mercy, <hi>Ier</hi> 18. 10. <hi>Now the Axe is laid to the root of every Tree,</hi> we muſt therefore lay it to the root of every ſinne ſinnes of conſtitution, ſinnes of cuſt ome, ſinnes againſt heaven and earth, God and man, the leaſt,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:112339:21"/>
the greateſt, let them all feele the ſharpneſſe and ſtrength of the Axe. He that ſpares any ſinne, doth what lyeth in him to ruine Parliament, Army, Citie, Kingdome, King and all, <hi>Ion.</hi> 3. 8. 10. When every one turned from his evill way, ſo that there was no way of wickedneſſe left unturn'd from, then God turn'd away his fierce anger and ſpared their Citie; if we turne every man from his evill wayes, and all thoſe wayes, we may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and ſuddenly expect Gods turning from his fierce wrath, and his walking in wayes of peace and mercy with us. Peace is a deſirable thing, yet not that peace will whet the Axe ſharper, and make it cut deeper; ſuch peace we deſire as will keep the God of peace with us; we take the wrong courſe for peace if we go on in our ſinnes, <hi>Eſ.</hi> 57. 21. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 68. 21. He that cries for peace with his lips, and deſtroyes it with his life, he maintaines the Warrs, divides betweenethe King and Parliament, and widens the breaches of the Kingdome. If we will faſt and goe on in ſinfull wayes, we may have a dubious and dangerous peace with men, but it's impoſsible we ſhould have any with God. I ſhall ſhut up this point with that of <hi>Samuel</hi> to the people, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 24, 25. <hi>Onely feare the Lord and ſerve him in truth with all your heart, for he hath don great things for you, but if you ſhall ſtill do wickedly, yee ſhall be conſumed, both yee and your King: progreſſe in wickedneſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth not peace.</hi> The true product of it is deſtruction to people, Parliament, King and Kingdome. If we would therefore have all ſafe, peace be in our Borders, and the God of peace be propitious to us, let us depart from all iniquitie.</p>
            <p>Hitherto I have ſpoken to all, give me leave now Honourable and worthy Senators, to commend ſome things to your conſiderations. My firſt and humble requeſt is, that the Axe of your power may not ly ſtill, but that Juſtice may be done. God is a God of Juſtice, he makes it knowne to all the world he layes his Axe to the root of the Tree, ſhew your ſelves a Parliament of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:112339:22"/>
Juſtice, let the world know it, lay the Axe to the root of Delinquencie. Neglect of Juſtice, as you heard before, indangers a Kingdome, <hi>Iudah</hi> was layd waſt becauſe there was no Judgement executed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Eſ.</hi> 5. 67. Suffer not a Kingdome to periſh upon that ground. It brings your Authority into contempt, and renders you deſpicable in the eyes of many: whereas if juſtice were done, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority would be more dreadfull and your perſons more Honourable, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. 28. when Judgement was given between the two Harlots, its ſaid, all <hi>Iſrael</hi> heard and feared; that act ſtruck feare into a whole Kingdom. We do not read what became of the Harlot which took away the Child from the true mother, but it is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and very probably, that ſhe died for it, according to the <hi>Plagiarian</hi> Law, of which you may read, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 16. <hi>Deut.</hi> 24. 7. It a man did ſteale an Iſraelite, or the Son of an Iſraelite, any ſoule, and the party were found in his hand, he was ſurely to be put to death; whence we may conclude, the Harlot ſuffered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the whole Kingdom feared, and <hi>Solomon</hi> was honoured for that act of Juſtice; it's execution of juſtice makes Authority to be regarded, and a Kingdome to feare: when your juſtice fell upon that great Cedar above a yeare and halfe agoe did not <hi>England</hi> tremble? did not it make many feare and flie? Juſtice ſecures a Kingdome, but neglect of it makes Courts contemptible and Kingdomes hazardable.</p>
            <p>Againe, the neglect of Juſtice enboldens men to goe on in wicked practiſes, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8 11. becauſe ſentence againſt an evill worke is not executed ſpeedily, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the hearts of the Sonnes of men is fully ſet in them to doe evill, they are void of all feare ſaith one <note n="a" place="margin">Abſque ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m re <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Our Reformation was conceived heretofore in ſinne, and now hath brought forth Iniquity, if it had bin for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med according to the mind of God, we ſhould not have had ſuch ſtirs and troubles in theſe daies; if any therefore have built up Hay, Straw, and Stubble, let your fire burne up ſuch combuſtible matter; if bryars and thornes do grow in the Sanctuarie, let your Axe cut them downe, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14. 3. 5.

Chriſt is preſented with his Fanne in his hand, and reſolution to purge it to purpoſe. The Jewes would not part with their Moſaicall Worſhip, they ſtuck to the Ceremonies and Rites of the Temple, but becauſe they would not purge out the corruptions crept in, nor part with the ſhaddow for the ſubſtance now come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore Chriſt fann'd them by a terrible judgment deſtroy'd, them, their Temple, and all the Formalities of it, ſetting up pure and Spirituall Worſhip, which had they admitted, their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction might have bin prevented. <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 33. 34.</p>
            <p>What corruptions are got into the worſhip of God, is not unknowne to you, the Worthies of our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> turne your hand upon us and purely purge out all the droſſe is there.

There is another thing yet, and very deſirable, you have been faithfull to the Kingdome hitherto, go on ſtill to be faithfull: you are Ambaſſadours of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt King, the great things of heaven and earth are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to your care; the glory of <hi>Iehovah,</hi> the Goſpel of Chriſt, the welfare of Churches, the good of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes; and in ſome reſpect of the whole Chriſtian world is in your hands.

Some Expoſitors underſtand by righteouſneſſe and faithfullneſſe, righteous and faithfull men, which are as neare and deare to Chriſt as his girdle; a great and glorious ornament unto him.

Faithfull men have the blesſings, when others have blowes and curſes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 20. <hi>A faithfull man abounds with bleſſings,</hi> his blesſings are without number; he ſhall have the blesſings of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent people; the blesſings of Generations to come, the bleſsings of heaven, the great God will powre forth his bleſsings upon ſuch, and ſay to them as to faithfull <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Gen.</hi> 12. 2. <hi>I will bleſſe you and make your names great, and you ſhall be a bleſſing, and thoſe that bleſſe you ſhall be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:</hi> the great God will powre forth great bleſsings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, and mens curſes ſhall never come neere you; If emergents of time ſhould prove ſuch as that you ſhould not accompliſh what you intend, yet you ſhall not goe without a bleſsing, <hi>Pſal</hi> 84. 5. <hi>Bleſſed is the man in whoſe heart are the wayes of God.</hi>
