         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Againe, these that are stedfast to their principles, will be found of two sorts; some are led in an ordinary common way and rest therein, admitting of nothing further then what they have attained unto; some (though they doe not undervalue the ordinary waies which in their owne kinds are usefull and necessary, yet they) aspire to something more then ordinary and rest not where they are, they believe that both in humane and divine matters, there is, as long as we are in this life, a <hi>plus ultra,</hi> and that we never ought
<pb facs="tcp:35224:15"/>
to rest in seeking after the advancement of learning and the increase of knowledge, till wee shall come to see the Father of lights face ro face; the different inclinations of these three sorts of men in the world, leading them to different courses and straines in their proceedings, and these begetting divers encounters amongst them wherein they disagree, and know not how to right matters towards one another for mutuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and edification, are the causes of all our strife and confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in all affaires, as well of Religious as of civill concernment; nor is it possible to be free from the disorders and distempers, which make the life of mankinde uncomfortable in this kind, and full of vexation, till God hath removed those that fall away from their owne stedfastnesse out of the earth, which will not come to passe till hee hath <hi>filled the earth with the knowledge of</hi>

               <hi>the Lord as the waters cover the sea;</hi> till hee hath brought us all that are stedfast unto true principles, and that walke by rules, <hi>unto the unity of the faith and knowledge of the sonne of God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>

in disproportionat frames, or justle one another out of their places for contrary ends; so all our confusions and revolutions of Churches, and States, and therein of scientificall straines, and of practicall undertakings, arise differently in the world: here then is a threefold diversity in acting, the changeable and moveable disposition of the one sort, is made to try the stabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the other two, and those that are setled in an ordinary way, are tryers to those that are led forth to something that is extraordinary; and those that upon allowed principles do ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally bring forth something more then ordinary, try the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity of the other two, how farre they love truth for it selfe; So that each of these puts his neighbour to the triall of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and constraines him to manifest the nature of his way, how farre it is, or is not from God: And although every thing which is beyond the ordinary straine, is liable to be censured and contradicted by men of ordinary apprehensions. who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne for the most part as extravagant and ridiculous whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is not levell with their capacities; yet I am inclined to believe, that there is alwaies something of God in all men, that are led forth by extraordinary motions, namely when their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits doe not reject the common true principles, and yet are rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed above them, to apprehend conclusions and inferences which are not common; and when their affections are regularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant to their workes, and their undertakings pursued with so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety in the feare of God, then I conceive that God hath put upon them a speciall stampe and character of his vertue, by which he doth fit them for some designe and service whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he hath raised them. I have observed this in very many men of publike spirits, most commonly they have bin laught at by others for going out of the common road-way of acting; whether to make good some opinions, which others never dreamt of, or to doe some businesse which others have thought impossibilities to be effected; (I say) I have observed, that when they have been led forth with modesty, without selfe concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tednesse and vanity, and when they have prosecuted their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises with remarkable perseverance, that God hath made them one way or other remarkably instrumentall and usefull to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their generation for the advancement of his worke,
<pb facs="tcp:35224:16"/>
which is the reformation of this world, and the restauration of all things by the kingdom of Iesus Christ, whereunto all extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary gifts, and the unusuall leadings forth of mens spirits are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratives. I could instance in severall men which I have known, and doe know abroad and at home, of severall professions, whose studies and endeavours have been lookt upon as whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies and extravagancies by the road-way-men of that profession; and yet I am perswaded that they are led and acted by that Spirit which leadeth the children of God in all truth; and because other men otherwise rationall and observant, (who though not altogether destitute of the spirit, yet are not raised above the ordinary pitch) do not know the drift of the spirit of these; therefore these are lookt upon by them as men of odde conceits: I have seen some of the great Rabbies of our times, heretofore much scandalized at the proposals and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings of Mr <hi>Comenius;</hi> but it hath pleased God to assist him so with grace, and support him with constancy in his way, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding many trialls and temptations; that he hath been able during his owne life, to see the usefulnesse of some of his endeavours, whereof a more full account will be given to the world very shortly. I could speake of others, whose attempts, though not so apparantly successefull during their life, yet no lesse usefull in their kind, and which in due time, will prove the grounds of great advantages and discoveries unto posterity, although in the generation where their lot is fallen to live, they have not been believed nor received. Gods way to dispence grace is not according to outward appearances, and for this cause, the multitude doth not entertaine the instruments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of with due esteem, nor the meanes by which it is offered to the world with respect, because they come in a homely dresse, and without the affectation of any shew; neverthelesse wisdom at all times is justified by her children, and there take notice of her paths, and trace the counsell of God therein, for they can see that Gods waies and counsels reach from end to end, and that he comprehends in his aime both that which is past, and that which is present, and that which is to come in future ages; so that in the conclusion of all, he will make it appeare, that the unusuall motions of his servants, which the world have
<pb facs="tcp:35224:17"/>
disesteemed and counted foolishnesse, have been the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary worke of his Spirit in them, whereby he doth convince the world of sinne, of righteousnesse, of judgement: of sinne, because the testimony which they bore to the truth was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; of righteousnesse, because they who served their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration faithfully with the righteous use of their talent in the midst of scorners, are justly taken away from an unthankfull generation and the evill day, to rest from their labours, that their workes may follow them; and of judgement, because the selfe conceited pride and partiality of the wise and prudent of this world, shall be judged and condemned by the worke of his spirit, when he shall bring all the effects thereof together to make out his compleate designe against the world, and by the conjunction of the seemingly scattered parts which his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants have acted upon their stages, produce the new frame of a perfect Scene, the catastrophe whereof shall make up a buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding fit for the kingdom of his Son.</p>
            <p>I am fallen upon these thoughts, and acquaint you thus with them, partly to support mine owne spirit against the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions which I meet withall in the way wherein God hath set me, for the constant prosecution of peace and truth without partiality amongst my brethren; partly to apologize for the drift of your spirit, whereby I perceive you have been led these many yeares in some of your studies; for it is very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to me, that you have sought after a matter, which to most men will seem incredible, rediculous and extravagant; and to tell you the truth, before I had read your discourse and seriously weighed matters, when I thought upon your theme, that the Americans should be of the seed of Israell, it seemed to me some what strange and unlikely to have any truth in it; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward when I had weighed your deduction of the matter, and lookt seriously upon Gods hand in bringing into those parts of the World where the Americans are, so many religious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, zealous for the advancement of his glory, and who are possessed with a beliefe from the Scriptures, that all the Tribes of Israell shall be called to the knowledge of Jesus Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the the end of the world: and when I had recollected and laid together some other scattered and confused thoughts
<pb facs="tcp:35224:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which at several times I have received, partly from the places of Scripture, which foretell the calling of the Jewes, and their restitution to their owne land, together with the bringing back of the ten Tribes from all the ends and corners of the earth, partly from some relations which I had heard a few yeeres agoe concerning the ten Tribes, which the Jewes here in <hi>Europe</hi> had given out; and partly from the observations of Gods way, which he seemes to make by all these changes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the States and Empires of the world, towards some great worke, and extraordinary revolution which may shortly come to passe: all which things when I had called to mind and represented unto my selfe, I was so far from derogating any thing from that which you have conjectured concerning the American Indians; that I beganne to stand amazed at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of the probabilities which so many waies offered themselves unto me, to make out and confirme the effect of that which you have said: And then I begun also upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account, to wonder at the strangenesse of Gods conduct o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your spirit, that he should have set you a worke twelve or more yeeres agoe, after the search of such a matter, by histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall observations, whereof then so few, and almost no foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps at all were extant to be traced, and whereof now, of a suddaine, the world is like to be filled with such evidences, that it wil be an astonishment to all that shall heare of it, and lay it to heart; and that all who have any ingenuity will be constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to confesse, that indeed there is a God who ruleth in the earth, and that he hath ordered the affaires of the Nations by an universal providence, to bring to passe his own counsels, and that the things which hee hath revealed by his word, should in the latter times be accomplished; for to my apprehension, this will be the great benefit of these discoveries; namely, that the mouths of Atheists will be stopped, and convicted of irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality and foolishnesse: For when it shall appear to all men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably, that the transmigration of Nations, and the affaires of this world, have not been carried hitherto by meere chance, or by the craftinesse of humane counsels, or by force; but by the wisdome of a Supreame conduct, who hath ordered all things from the beginning towards an end which hath been
<pb facs="tcp:35224:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
foreknown, and to a designe foretold. (I say) when this shall appeare, and that in the midst of all these changes and confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there is a conduct over-ruling the force of man, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointing the councels of the crafty; then the eyes of all men will be upon the Lord, and God alone will bee exalted in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, and the Holy one of Israell in judgement: For see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is evident that the ten Tribes of Israell have been as it were lost in the world neare about the space of two thuusand yeeres, if now they should againe appeare upon the stage, first as it were in another world by themselves, and then afterward speedily come from thence hither to the land of their ancient inheritance, where they shall be joyned to their brethren the Jews (which is clearly foretold by the Prophets shall come to passe) if (I say) those things should now begin to come to passe,<note place="margin">Isa. 2. Ezec. 34 &amp; 37. Jer. 3c. &amp; 46. Amos. 9. Micha. 4. &amp;c.</note> what can all the world say otherwise, but that the Lords coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell doth stand, and that he hath fulfilled the words spoken by his Servants the Prophets concerning Israel; that although all the sinfull kingdoms of the Nations shall be destroyed from off the face of the earth, yet that the house of <hi>Iacob</hi> shall not be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly destroyed, but shall be corrected in measure, <hi>for loe I will command</hi> (saith God by the Prophet) <hi>and I will sift the house</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 30. 10, 11. Amos<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9. 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>of Israell among all Nations, like as corne is sifted in the sieve, yet shall not the least graine fall upon the earth.</hi> These Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies must needs be fulfilled, if there be a God in heaven who hath foretold them, and when he shall make this his word good unto Israell, he will thereby make it undeniably apparent, that it was he himselfe and none other who did foretell it: and that it is also none but hee who brings the worke about beyond all humane appearances, according as he did foretell it: and by all this he will shew to all the world, that which he oft-times repeates by the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> that he alone is the Saviour, and that there is none besides him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 45. 5, 6, 15. <hi>till the end.</hi> The destruction then of the spirituall <hi>Babylon</hi> by the restauration of Israel, shall make out this to all the earth, that God alone is the Lord over all, and the Saviour of the people that put their trust in his name.</p>
            <p>Now the appearances which offer themselves unto me, that these Prophecies are towards their accomplishment, are
<pb facs="tcp:35224:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
many, which now I shall not insist upon, (perhaps God will direct me to declare them in due season more fully then now I can intend) but I shall onely mention that which I find to be a confirmation of your conjecture, leaving it to your owne discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what use you will make of it.</p>
            <p>First then I shall impart unto you some stories which I heard five or six yeeres agoe, when I was in the Low Countries, concerning the ten Tribes; and then I shall adde some informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning the state of the Iewes in our Europaean and Asia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atique worlds, which I have learned at other times by some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences which God hath offered unto mee; and upon the whole matter I shall leave you to your further conjectures, by that which I shall guesse at.</p>
            <p>The first story which I heard was at the <hi>Hague,</hi> a person of chief quality about the Queen of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and one of her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, and a discerning godly man, and my speciall friend told me, that the Jew (a Jeweller residing ordinarily at the <hi>Hague</hi>) whom I knew, had been there at Court, and with great joy had told, that they of his Nation had received from <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> Letters, bringing to them glad tidings of two speciall matters fallen out there; the one was, that the Grand Seignior had remitted the great taxes which formerly had been laid upon the Jewes of those parts, so that now they were in a manner free from all burthens, paying but a small and inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable matter to that Empire; the other was, that a messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was come unto the Jewes who reside neere about the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Land, from the ten Tribes, to make enquiry concerning the state of the Land; and what was become of the two Tribes and the half which was left in it; when they were transported from thence by <hi>Salmanasser.</hi> This Messenger was described to be a grave man, having some attendance in good equipage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him. He told them that the people from which hee was sent were the Tribes of Israel, which in the daies of <hi>Hosea</hi> the<note place="margin">2 King. 17.</note> King, were carried captives out of their owne Land by the King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> who transported them from <hi>Samaria</hi> into <hi>Assyria</hi> and the Cities of the Medes; but they being grieved for the tronsgressions which caused God to be angry with them, they tooke a resolution to separate themselves from all Idolaters, and
<pb facs="tcp:35224:19"/>
so went from the Heathen where they were placed by <hi>Salma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nassar,</hi> with a resolution to live by themselves, and observe the Commandements of God, which in the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> owne Land they had not observed: in prosecuting this resolution, after a long journey of a yeere and six moneths, they came to a countrey wholly destitute of inhabitants, where now they have increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed into a great Nation, and are to come from thence into their owne Land by the direction of God; and to shew them that hee was a true Israelite, hee had brought with him a Scroule of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> written according to their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman who told me this story, as from the mouth of the Jew, said that it brought to his mind fully (by reason of the agreement of circumstances almost in all things) the story which is recorded in the Second Booke of <hi>Esdras,</hi> which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Apocrypha, Chap. 13. ver. 40. till 50. which will be found a truth if that Messenger came and made this Narrative. This was the first story; and not long after <hi>viz.</hi> Within the space of five or six moneths, a little before I came from the Low Countries, I was told of a Jew who came from <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> to <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> and brought to the Jewes residing there, newes concerning the ten Tribes; that hee had been with them upon the border of their Land, and had conversed with some of them for a short space, and seen and heard remarkable things whiles he stayed with them, whereof then I could not learn the true particulars; but I heard that a Narrative was made in writing of that which he had related, which before I went from <hi>Holland</hi> last, I had no time to seeke after, but since the reading of your Booke, and some discourse I have had with you about these matters, I have procured it from the Low Countries, and received a Copie thereof in French, attested un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Manasseh Ben Israel</hi> his hand, that it doth exactly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the originall, as it was sent me, the translation thereof I have truly made without adding or taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way any thing; and because I was not satisfied in some things, and desired to know how farre the whole matter was believed among the Jewes at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> I wrote to <hi>Manasseh Ben Israel,</hi> their chiefe Rabbi, about it, and his answer I have gotten
<pb facs="tcp:35224:19"/>
in two Letters, telling me that by the occasion of the Questions which I proposed unto him concerning this adjoyned Narrative<note place="margin">This narrative so attested and translated, is at the end of this Book.</note> of Mr. <hi>Antonie Monterinos,</hi> hee to give me satisfaction, had written insteed of a Letter, a Treatise, which hee shortly would publish, and whereof I should receive so many Copies as I should desire: In his first Letter dated <hi>Novem.</hi> last, 25. he saies that in his treatise he handles of the first inhabitants of <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> which he believes were of the ten Tribes; moreover, that they are scattered also in other Countries, which he names, and that they keepe their true Religion, as hoping to returne againe into the Holy land in due time.</p>
            <p>In his second Letter, dated the twenty three of <hi>December,</hi> he saies more distinctly thus: I declare how that our Israelites were the first finders out of <hi>America;</hi> not regarding the opinions of other men, which I thought good to refute in few words onely: and I thinke that the ten Tribes live not onely there, but also in other lands scattered every where; these never did come backe to the second Temple, and they keep till this day still the Jewish Religion, seeing all the Prophecies which speake of their bringing backe unto their native Soile must be fulfilled: So then at their appointed time, all the Tribes shall meet from all the parts of the world into two provinces, namely <hi>Assyria</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> nor shall their Kingdome be any more divided, but they shall have one Prince the Messiah the Sonne of <hi>David.</hi> I do also set forth the Inquisition of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and rehearse divers of our Nation, and also of Christians, Martyrs, who in our times have suffered severall sorts of torments, and then having shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with what great honours our Jewes have been graced also by severall Princes who professe Christianity. I prove at large, that the day of the promised Messiah unto us doth draw neer, upon which occasion I explaine many Prophecies, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>By all which you see his full agreement with your conjecture concerning the Americans, that they are descended of the Hebrewes: when his booke comes to my hand, you shall have it God willing.</p>
            <p>In the meane time I shall adde some of my conjectures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Jewes which live on this side of the world with us in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Asia;</hi> these are of two sorts or Sects, the one is
<pb facs="tcp:35224:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Pharisees, the other of Caraits, the Pharisees in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Asia</hi> are in number farre beyond the Caraits, they differ from one another wheresoever they are, as Protestants doe from Papists; for the Pharisees, as the Papists, attribute more to the Authoritie and traditions of their Rabbies and Fathers, then to the word of God; but the Caraits will receive nothing for a rule of faith and obedience but what is delivered from the word of God immediately: and their name imports their professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they are readers of the Text, or Textuaries, for so the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> you know when it relates to bookes and writings, is to be rendred. These two Sects are irreconcilably opposite to each other, and as the Papists deale with Protestants, so do the Pharisees with the Caraits, they persecute and suppres them and their profession by all the meanes they can possibly make use of: Nay as Mr <hi>Ritangle</hi> (of whom I have all the informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which I know concerning the Caraits) tels me, the hatred of the Pharisees is so fierce against their opposites the Caraits, that they have Anathematized them so; as never to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto them; insomuch, that it is counted unlawfull so much as to speake to any of them, or to any that belongeth unto them, but at the distance of foure cubits at least; their Bookes and all things belonging to them, are avoided as things abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and to be abhorred; nor will the Pharisees, although the Caraits should become penitent, and desire to be joyned to their Congregations, and renounce their owne way, admit of them as a Caraite reconciled unto them: but the Caraite must first become a Christian, a Mahumetan, or an Idolater, before he can be admitted to joyne with them, that it may never bee said that a Pharisee was reconciled to a Caraite, or that a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raite is become a Pharisee. As their principles and affections are thus different, so are their opinions, and the course of their life extremely opposite; the Pharisees are full of superstitious imaginary foolish conceits, and thalmudicall questions and ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities in their Sermons and Bookes; the Caraits are rationall men that take up no doctrines but what the Scriptures teach, by comparing one text with another: The Pharisees have wild and extravagant fancies concerning the Messiah and his reigne; but the Caraits have true grounds of spirituall and raised thoughts
<pb facs="tcp:35224:20"/>
concerning the Messiah and his Kingdome, little different from that which the better sort of Christians truly believe, and professe of these misteries. The Pharisees in their Sermons insist upon nothing but their traditions and ceremonies, and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish curiosities; but the Caraits insist onely upon necessary and profitable duties, teaching the way of Godlinesse and honesty, to bring men from the outward forme to the inward power and spirituall performance of divine worship.</p>
            <p>As concerning their course of life, the Pharisees live every where by a way of trading &amp; usury, which is destructive to those with whom they have commerce; but the Caraits abhor that way, as pestilent unto humane societies, and betake themselves to trades, and manufactures, to become husbandmen, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in the places where they live, and to serve as Souldiers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Magistrate, who doth protect them.</p>
            <p>This being the state and difference of these two Sects, (as he who in <hi>Asia</hi> and some part of <hi>Europe</hi> hath been above twenty yeers conversant with them, and a Doctor in their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues, hath informed me) I shall acquaint you with my Conjectures concerning the event of our present troubles in the world over all, and the revolution of the Jewish state, which are these; that it is not unlikely to me that the issue and effect of these changes which now are wrought, and afoot to bee wrought in the world, (wherein the highest powers are sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and a generall distresse is brought upon all the Nations of the earth) will be a breaking of the yokes of tyranny and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, under which not onely the Jewes every where groan, but with them most of the Gentiles, or rather all of them that are under an arbitrary power of absolute Potentates, and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious selfe-seeking teachers; that the breaking of these yokes is already a great way advanced. First, in the Easterne <hi>China</hi> Empire by the invasion of the Tartarians. Secondly, in the Northerne and Easterne Mahometane Empire, by the changes brought upon, and likely to fall out in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> house and line; and by the liberty which of late hath been granted to the Jewes, not onely from taxes, but of repairing to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and having Synagogues there, which heretofore was utterly prohibited. Thirdly, in the Westerne, which is called the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb facs="tcp:35224:21"/>
or German Empire, by these late troubles, and the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance which the King of the <hi>North</hi> the Swede, hath given to Protestants to maintaine their liberty: All the power of these yokes must yet further be broken in the Supreame and Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Ministers thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in respect of the whole bodies of these Empires, and of the particular Kingdomes and States which resort under the same; for all Nations by the light of naturall reason, but chiefely those, whom the Gospel hath enlightned, and prepared in a measure, to apprehend the hope of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious liberty of the Sonnes of God, will more and more every where resent their priviledge and right to a freedome, from which they have been restrained, by the mistery of iniquity in spirituall and corporall matters; and when the grounds of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous order, of impartiall love to mankinde, and of common preservation, shall breake forth at last, and be taken notice of in the midst of these confusions and great troubles which fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all sorts of men; then the Jewes will come and appeare in their owne ranke, and for their own interest, they will by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers be respected; for their interest will be upon the dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Mahometan, to resist and oppose the Spanish Monarchy, that it may not propagate it selfe Eastward, and Southward, beyond the Mediterranean Sea; and that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition by which they have been so cruelly persecuted, may be every where abolished; but above all things, kept out of the holy Land and their beloved City <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> If then there should be any transactions (as it is said there is like to be) between the <hi>Ottoman</hi> house and the house of <hi>Spaine</hi> about the Holy Land, the Jewes who are now at some liberty there, and begin from all parts of the Earth to lift up their eyes to looke thitherward, will quickely resent it, and finde their interest to be the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their owne inheritance; and to helpe them to it, they will finde assistance from all Christians that are not slaves to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition and tyranny, and that assistance and favour which by such Christians will be given them, may in Gods hand be a meanes to open the Pharisee his eyes, to see somewhat in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, from which he hath been hitherto blinded, by reason of the prejudice which the Idolatry of the Papall Sea, and the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Inquisition hath begotten in him. As for the Caraits, God
<pb facs="tcp:35224:21"/>
hath so ordered it, that the greatest bodies of them are in the Northerne parts of the World, by which the ten Tribes, if ever they come to the Holy Land, are like to come; there be some few in <hi>Russia,</hi> some in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> some in <hi>Alcair,</hi> some in <hi>Persia,</hi> and some in other places of <hi>Asia</hi> and of <hi>Africa;</hi> but Mr <hi>Ritangle</hi> told me that their chiefe bodie is amongst the Asi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atique and European Tartarians, who now appeare upon the stage as beginning to be conquerers. For besides that which they doe fully possesse in <hi>China,</hi> they have tasted somewhat of a victorious progresse of late in <hi>Poland,</hi> and they are the next pretenders to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Crowne, if the line faile, which is like to be: their rising and dissipation abroad from their owne centers to their circumferences towards neighbour Nations, will weaken them at home; and if then, when they are not strong within their owne bounds, and by their invasions have weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their neighbours Southward on; God call the ten Tribes to march toward the place of their inheritance: the Caraits their brethren will be leaders of them on their way, and so their march may be, as <hi>Manasseh Ben Israel</hi> saith, to make their Rendezvous in <hi>Assyria;</hi> and on the other side, the Jewes that are Pharisees, may make their Rendezvous from <hi>Arabia</hi> and other neighbouring places, and out of all <hi>Europe</hi> into <hi>Egypt;</hi> that so when the Shunamite shall returne (as it is said in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> chap. 6. ver. 13.) the world may looke upon her, and may see in her <hi>the company of two Armies,</hi> which both shall look towards <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Then will the great battaile of Harma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geddon be fought, whereunto all these troubles and changes are but preparatives: then shall the sword of the Spirit, the word of God, prevaile mightily over the spirits of all men; the two edges thereof on the right hand and on the left, will cut sharpe, and pierce to the dividing asunder of soule and spirit, and of the joynts and marrow, and to the discerning of the thoughts and intentions of the heart: and when this sword shall be thus powerfull in the hands of his Saints, (the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants with the one troope, and the true Caraits with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) then shall be fulfilled the Prophecie of the Psalmist, that<note place="margin">Psa. 149 7, 8, 9.</note> vengeance shall be executed upon the Heathen, and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the people; that their Kings shall be bound with
<pb facs="tcp:35224:22"/>
chaines, and their Nobles with fetters of iron; and that the honour due to all Saints shall be given them, to be made execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners of the judgement written in the word of God against them. We know not how neare these things are at hand, let us therefore be watchfull, and put on the armour of light, to be ready, when the Bridegroome comes, to goe with him in our wedding garment, having our lamps burning, and provision of oile, into the wedding chamber. And to this effect, the Lord teach us to be diligent, to be found of him in peace, without spot and blamelesse, that in the midst of these fightings and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions, we may not be found as many are, smiting their fellow servants, eating and drinking largely of the spoile of those that are spoiled, and being drunken with the passions of malice, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained for the revenge of injuries, or of covetousnesse and ambition, prosecuted for self-interests: and with this prayer I shall commend you to the grace of God, and rest,</p>

               <p>THE people that have not yet received the Gospell of Jesus Christ are Jewes, but the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans have not yet been gospelized; and here three things come to consideration.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. All other nations at first received the Gospell.</item>
                  <item>2. The Jewes before the end of the world shall be converted.</item>
                  <item>3. These Indians have not yet heard of Christ.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. As the Scripture foreseeing that God would ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie the Gentiles through faith, preached before the Gospell unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> saying, <hi>in thee shall all the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles be blessed, Gal.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 2, 3. 18. 8. In like manner the glorious Gospell was soon conveyed to them, soon after the comming of Christ, even before the death of the Apostles; holy <hi>David</hi> spake of this promulgation, when he said, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 1. The Heavens, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Apostles did declare the glory of God, &amp;c. For the fourth, <hi>Their line is gone out into all Lands, and their words into the end of the world,</hi> is applied by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to this very purpose, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 18. It was the command of their Master, <hi>Goe teach all Nations, &amp;c. Mat.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>and preach the Gospell to every creature, Mar.</hi> 16. 15. and they gave hereto most willing obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which we must have believed, though it had not bin so exactly recorded in undoubted ecclesiasticall Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:35224:40"/>
never man dwelt, that they might there keepe their sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, which they never kept in their owne land, and they entred into <hi>Euphrates,</hi> by the narrow passages of the river, for through that Countrey there was a great way to goe, namely of a yeere and an halfe, and the same Region is called <hi>Arsareth,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Esdr.</hi> 13. 40. &amp;c. <note n="a" place="margin">Acost. l. 1. c. 9</note> 
                  <hi>Acosta</hi> is of opinion that these words thus produced by many, make in truth against this conjecture, and that for two reasons. 1. The ten Tribes went so farre to keepe their statutes and ceremonies, but these Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans observe none of them, being given up to all Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: And is this at all consequent, such was their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, therefore the successe must be answerable? is it likely they should be so tenacious in a farre and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne land, that never kept them in their owne, as the next words expresse? His second Argument is of like force, for tis not said, that <hi>Euphrates</hi> and <hi>America</hi> be contiguous, or places so neere one the other, much<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse that the entries of that River should stretch to the Indies; but hee tells of a very long journey taken by them, suitable to the places of their removall, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, which was to a Countrey where never man dwelt, and what Countrey could this be but <hi>America?</hi> all other parts of the world being then knowne and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited: Besides there hath bin a common tradition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews, and in the world, that those ten tribes are utterly lost; in what place are they then like to be found if not in <hi>America?</hi> for they shall be found againe. Some conjectures that they came from <hi>Norway,</hi> and be of that nation, have bin mentioned, with the improbability also thereof; and now lately <hi>T. Gage</hi> sets forth his new survey of the West Indies, his long abode there, and diligent observation of many, very many remarkable passages in

Their barbarous properties are most like the Tartats of any; this argument mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates with more force for their Judaisme, to which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their rites be so consonant, both sacred and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, as hath been said. And thirdly the West side of <hi>America,</hi> if it be not continent with <hi>Tartary,</hi> is yet disjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a small straite; but the like may be said of some other parts, that they be or may have been neer some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther maine lands, and so by that reason of some other race and extract. 4. The people of <hi>Quivira</hi> neerest to <hi>Tartary,</hi> are said to follow the seasons and pasturing of their cattell like the Tartarians; this particular, a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the generall, delivered in the second reason, is there glanced upon, but all he saith of this nature, and others with him, are so farre from weakening our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, that they may be embraced rather as friendly supports thereunto, if others have guessed right that conceive the Tartars also themselves to be Jewes. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew Paris</hi>

               <p>THe first of these is already going, the stocke of prayers, both hence and thence on that behalfe to heaven, and not now in a vision, as to St. <hi>Paul</hi> once, there stood a man and prayed him, saying, <hi>Come over into Macedonia and helpe us,</hi> Act. 16. 9. but the Natives begin to be really sensible of their spirituall necessities, and call earnestly for that bread, and our countrey men desire the assistance of their brethren here in many respects, all their Letters earnestly bespeak us in this, and O that we did heartily answer them in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and fervent prayers, in reference to this worke. There was indeed of late a generation of men, though extreme lovers of that Lethargy, yet forgate to be in charity with all men, they were content in their Letany to pray it would please God to have mercy upon all men, yet deemed it piacular to pray for the Novangles; The Directory guides otherwise, even by name advising to prayers for those Plantations in the remote parts of the World.</p>

This worke would be much prospered by a stocke of wise and constant correspondence mutually betwixt Old and New England in regard of this businesse, what progresse is made in the worke, what meet to bee done for its furtherance, &amp;c.

               <p>At the title of haeresie, <note n="c" place="margin">p. 24.</note> this is the preface. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though no humane power be Lord over the faith and consciences of men, and therefore may not constraine them to believe or professe against their consciences, yet because such as bring in damnable heresies, tending to the subversion of the Christian Faith, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the soules of men, ought duly to be restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from such notorious impiety, it is therefore ordered and decreed by this Court:</p>

It is therefore ordered, and decreed, That if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny christian, so called, within this jurisdiction, shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuously behave himself towards the word preached, or the messengers thereof—either by interrupting him in his preaching, or by charging him falsely with any error, which he hath not taught, or like a son of <hi>Korah</hi> cast upon his true doctrine, or himselfe, any reproach—every such person or persons (whatsoever censure the Church may passe) shall for the first scandall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented and reproved openly by the Magistrate at some Lecture, and bound to their good behaviour, and if a second time they breake forth into the like contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous carriages, they shall either pay five pounds to the publique treasury, or stand two houres openly upon a blocke or stoole foure foot high on a Lecture day with a paper fixed on his breast, written in capitall letters, AN OPEN AND OBSTINATE CONTEM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NER OF GODS HOLY ORDINANCES, that others may feare and be ashamed of breaking out into the like wickednesse. 1646.</p>

cast off his Ordinances; now blessed of God from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth be our Novangles, Magistrates, Ministers, and people that have so seasonably witnessed against these abominations.</p>
               <p>They are great lovers of peace and government, these therefore be their words in another place; <note n="e" place="margin">

               <p>4.

Wee next<note place="margin">p. 3.</note> asked them if they understood what was spoken, which they affirmed with many voices, and then wee desired to know if they would propound any questions to us, for their further satisfaction, and this they did, but not such curiosities as some others of them had done before, as, <hi>what was the cause of thunder, of the ebbing and flowing</hi>

If they<note place="margin">Questions to them.</note> did not desire to see God, and if they were not tempted to thinke there was no God, because they could not see him? some of them replyed they did indeed desire to see him, but we had taught them that could not be, yet they believed, though their eyes could not see him, hee was to be seen with their soules within. 2. Wee as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked if it were not strange to them there should be but one God, yet this God should be in <hi>Massachusets, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nectacut, Quimipenik,</hi> in old England, in this <hi>Wigwam,</hi> in the next, every where? It is strange one of them said, as all else is we hear preached; yet they thought it might<note place="margin">p. 7.</note> be true that God was so big every where. 3. Whether they did not finde something troubling them within af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the commission of sinne, as murther, adultery, theft, lying, &amp;c. they confest the trouble, but could not tell what to say to it, he therefore that first spake to them concluded with a dolefull description (as far as his language permitted) of the trembling condition of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very soule that dies in sinne, and shall be cast out of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from God. Having thus spent three houres, wee asked them if they were not weary, they said no, wee resolved to leave them with an appetite; the chiefe of them seeing us conclude with prayer, desired to know when wee would come againe, wee appointed the time, gave the children some Apples, and the men

what was at hand, they asked more ground to build a Towne together, which wee liked well, and promising our furtherance for them at the Generall Court, wee departed with many welcomes from them.</p>

                     <hi>November</hi> 11. 1646, Wee came againe to the same<note place="margin">Second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</note> Wigwam, there was a greater concourse, and seats pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for us, wee began againe with prayer in English, and then catechized the younger sort, wee asked them<note place="margin">p. 8.</note> onely three questions in their own language. 1. Who made you and all the world? 2. Who shall save you from sinne and hell? 3. How many commandements hath God given you to keepe? The Preacher then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, Wee are come to bring you good newes from the great God, and to shew how evill men may come to be good, and be happy while they live, and goe to God when they die; then in familiar descriptions hee set forth God to them in his glorious power, goodnesse and greatnesse, shewing what his will was, and what he required, even of the Indians, in the ten Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and how angry God was for any sinne, yet that hee sent Christ to die for their transgressions, and to pacifie God by suffering in their roome, if they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe the Gospell, and that hee would love the poore Indians if now they sought God, threatning wrath against all such as stood out and neglected so great salvation, &amp;c. In hearing these things about sinne, and<note place="margin">p. 9.</note> hell, and Christ, one of them shewed much affliction, desiring to conceale his griefe; about an houre thus spent, wee desired them to propound some questions, and the first was by an old man, <hi>If it were not to late for</hi>

What doe<note place="margin">P. 13.</note> you remember of that spoken to you the last time wee were here? after some speech among themselves, one of them said, They did much thank<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God for our comming, and the things they heard were wonderfull to them; then Secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wee said, Do you believe the things we tell you, and that God is <hi>Musquantum, i. e.</hi> very angry for the least sinne in your thoughts, or words, or works? they said yes, and we spake further of the terrors of God against sinners, and his mercy to the penitent, seeking after Christ; night being almost come, considering the Indians desired to know how to pray, and thought that Christ did not understand their language, one of us ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prayed in their tongue above a quarter of an houre, divers of them holding up eyes and hands, and one of them hung downe his head, with his rag before his eyes,<note place="margin">A weeping In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian.</note> which when hee had wiped, hee held up his head againe, yet such was the power of God upon his heart, that hee hung downe his head againe, covered his eyes, wiping them and weeping abundantly, till prayer was ended,<note place="margin">P. 14.</note> then hee turned to a corner of the Wigwam, and wept
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:35224:76"/>
more by himselfe, which one of us perceiving, spake encouraging words, hee then wept more and more; when he came out of the Wigwan, wee spake to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, hee then fell into more abundant weeping, like one deepely affected, so as wee could not forbeare wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping over him also; wee departed greatly rejoycing for such sorrowing. And while I am transcribing this, I know not whether first, to pitty the poore Natives in their spirituall distres, or sympathize with the English in their holy compassion, or praise God more for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering to the Indians their lost condition by n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>e, i. e.</hi> all. The chiefe Sachim of this place had heard him before, and now shewed great affection to him, and the word of God, using many arguments to perswade him to tarry among them, saying, his comming but once a yeere did them little good, it was as if one should come and throw a fine thing among them, and they like it well, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell what is within, whether something, or nothing, but if it be opened and they see it precious, they should believe it, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Another Indian learning from Mr. <hi>Elliot</hi> that hee had five sonnes, asked him if they should all teach the Indians to know God, as he did, which when hee affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the other was well pleased, and Mr. <hi>Elliot</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe much encouraged, for hee had often dedicated them in his prayers to that service of the Lord, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring no better preferment for them, than to be fitted for that worke, hee endeavours therefore with that smal meanes he hath to traine them up in learning, and God will I doubt not raise up some liberall hearts and hands to assist him therein.</p>
                  <p>This summer hee was making another journey, but
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:35224:83"/>
in regard of some quarrells among the Indians, the Church was doubtfull at first of his going, which when the <hi>Nashaway</hi> Sachim heard, he took twenty men armed after their manner, and was his guard, with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neerer Indians, so much do they hunger after instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; this was a long journey into the wildernesse of sixty miles, it proved very wet and tedious, so that hee was not dry three or foure daies together night nor day, but the Lord upheld him and his company in strength and health. One of the Indians would needs know of Mr <hi>Elliot</hi> the reason why they that pray to God, love the Indians so doing, more than their owne Brethren, and when the rest of them said they all found it so in their hearts, this gave him occasion to discourse to them of the unity of the spirit. They propounded questions.</p>

complaine of their ill fortune, saying that they deserved all that, and more also for their sinnes, which the said <hi>Francis</hi> hearing answered, that they should have pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that shortly they should have rest; whereunto they answered that they deserved it not, having used the holy people so ill, and the most noble of all the Nations in the world; but contrariwise that all the cruelties which the Spaniards had used against them did befall unto them for the expiating of that sin; after they were gone a little while, they stopt upon the Mountaine to rest, and passe the night season, at which time the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said <hi>Monterinos</hi> did take out of a box some few biskets, some cheese and sweet-meates, and offered some to the foresaid <hi>Francis,</hi> saying to him, take this though thou dost speake evill of the Spaniards, whereunto hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that he had not told the halfe of the hard usage which they received from that cruell and inhumane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but that after a short space they should see them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves avenged upon them by a hidden Nation: after these discourses between them, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

            <p>These discourses being all ended, which lasted all that day, they came backe and told him the same Wednes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day and Thursday, not adding a word more thereunto. And <hi>Monterinos</hi> being wearied, that they answered him nothing to that which hee asked, and that they would not permit him to passe the River, did draw neere the Boate in a dissembling way, and would have cast him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe therein to goe to the other side, but they thrust her from the shoare with a staffe, and the said <hi>Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinos</hi> falling into the water hee was in danger of being drowned, because he could not swimme; the men cast themselves suddenly into the water, and drew him out, and shewing themselves angry, said unto him, doe not
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:35224:89"/>
think that thou wilt bring to passe thy purpose by force; which the Indian declared unto him, and they shewed unto him by signes and words.</p>
            <p>Notice is to be taken that the Boat for the space of those three daies did not at all stay in one place, but four men went and foure other came, which all of them said the same nine things which we have mentioned, being all the men who during that time came to see him, about 300 more or lesse.</p>
            <p>These men are somewhat burnt with the Sunne, some of them weare their haire to their knees, some others shorter, and others as wee use to weare it, faire bodies, good countenances, well made of foot and leg, with a lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen about their heads.</p>
            <p>Moreover the said M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Monterinos</hi> declared, that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from that place on Thursday at night with a great deale of provision which they brought to him, he tooke his leave of them, having been entertained by them, during the three daies which he staied there; and having shewed him how they enjoyed all things which the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards have in the Indies, aswell of meates as of other things needfull for the life of man. Being come the same day to the place where they had lien the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Monterinos</hi> said to the Indian, <hi>Francis,</hi> thou dost know that my Brethren said unto me that thou shouldest tell me something, therefore I pray thee tell it now to satisfie my desire, whereunto the Indian said, I shall tell thee what I know, if thou wilt not anger mee, and shall relate unto thee the truth so as I have heard it from my Ancestors, but if thou dost vex me (which I apprehend, perceiving thee to be so speculatif) thou wilt oblige me to tell thee lies; so then I beseech thee take onely heed to what I shall say unto thee.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:35224:90"/>Thy Brethren the sonnes of <hi>Israel</hi> were by divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence brought into these Countrys, God doing many miracles for them, which thou wouldst not believe, if I should tell them to thee as I have heard them of my Fathers; Wee Indians went into those Countries and made warre against them, and did use them worse then the Spaniards doe us: Afterwards by the command of our Mohanes (these are their Sorcerers) wee went as Souldiers towards those parts where thou hast seen thy Brethren, to wage warre with them, and of all those that entred there, not one came backe againe alive; wee made a great Armie, and entring into his lands, all fell downe dead, so that not one escaped; at last wee raised another Army, for the making of which the Countrey was dispeopled wholly, so that none but old men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children remained therein, which came to an end as the former had done; which those who remained alive, and were not gone to that warre perceiving, said, that the Mohanes had deceived them and were the cause of the death of their Fathers, for which they deserved to be put to death, having then killed many of them, those that remained alive did intreat them to hearken to them, and they would discover to them all the truth of that which they knew, which having gotten leave, declared that which followeth.</p>
            <p>The God of these sonnes of <hi>Israel</hi> is the true God, all that is written in his stories is true, they shall be Lords of all the world in the latter end, a people shall come hither which will bring many things to you, and when the land shall be well provided, these sonnes of <hi>Israel</hi> shall goe out of their habitations, and shall become Lords of all the earth as it was theirs before, if you will be happy joyne your selves to them. The Indian ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb facs="tcp:35224:90"/>
made an end to relate the prediction of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanes, followed on his discourse after this manner, My Fathers were Caciques, and there are yet four of them. These 5 Caciques then having heard what the Mohanes had foretold, as if they had been some of the Sages of the Hebrewes, came and tooke their habitation neere that place, to see if they could get acquaintance with some of thy Brethren. They satisfied their desire after a long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>time by the intercession of an Indian woman: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thy Brethren would never speake to our Fathers, and he of us that went into their Lands, did fall downe dead, and none of thy Brethren did passe over to us; we therefore made a League with them, by the meanes of that woman, under these conditions. First, that five men, sonnes to five Caciques or their successors, should come to visit them every seventy Moones, and that none should come with them. Secondly, that the man to whom the secret was to be declared, should be three hundred Moones old, and that nothing of this should be revealed to him in a place inhabited, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the open field, and when it should be revealed, that it should be in the company of all the Caciques; thus then (said the Indian) wee keepe this secreet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, for the great reward which wee hope, for the innumerable services which wee have done to thy Brethren. Wee cannot go to see them, but from seventy to seventy Moones, if no new thing fall out; there hath not been any in my time except thy arrivall which they have so much desired and waited for. I finde no more but three new things according to my reckoning; the first, the arrivall of the Spaniards in these Countries, the second that Ships arrived in the
<pb facs="tcp:35224:91"/>
South sea, and the third is thy arrivall. Of all three they have greatly rejoyced, for they say that the Prophecies do come to passe.</p>
            <p>Moreover the said <hi>Monterinos</hi> declared, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hee came to <hi>Honda,</hi> where the said Indian did bring to him three Indian young men, not telling him their names, till hee told him that hee might speake freely with them, seeing they were his companions, whith whom hee was in league, and that the other namely the fift was old, and for that cause was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to come. The three Indians did imbrace him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately, and asked him of what Nation hee was; to whom hee answered, that hee was of the Hebrew Nation, of the Tribe of <hi>Levi;</hi> and then they imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him the second time, and said to him, Thou shalt see us one day, and shalt not know us, wee are thy Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren by a speciall favour which God hath shewed us, and having saluted him they went away: the Indian <hi>Francis</hi> bid him also farewell, and that hee went to speak with his Brethren in the company of the other Caciques. As concerning this Countrey, wee have all the Indians at our command, and when wee shall have made an end of these cruell Spaniards, wee shall goe and draw you out of the slavery wherein you are, if it please God; which he will permit, because his word cannot faile.</p>
