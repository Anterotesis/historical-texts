         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

READERS,
WHETHER
Children or others.</head>
            <p>THis Youth was a very duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Child to his Parents,
and patient, and ready to
receive Inſtruction; never was
known to reſist his Father or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Advice and Councel, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ready to obey their Commands,
and minded good things, being very
baſhful, and ready to put himſelf
forwards to do any buſineſs to pleaſe
his Parents or Relations; never
<pb facs="tcp:33776:3"/>
ſullen nor dogged; and what he did
it was with all his might faithfully
in obedience to a meek and quiet Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
to the laſt Minute: In the time
of his Health for Three Years laſt
paſt, he uſed to go to hear at the
Meetings of the People called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi>
and no where elſe, and was
by rude Boys ſcoff'd, at, and called
a <hi>Quaker.</hi> He was a very manly,
meek and ſober Child, not given to
quarrel with any. What we have
here related, that he ſpoke of the great
Love of the Lord, both to his own
Soul, and to his People, is far ſhort
of what he declared. His depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hence was on the Third day of
the Fifth Month 1675, at 7 in the
Morning, the 13 day of his Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
in great ſtillneſs and patience
he entred into Everlaſting Life.</p>

            <head>The Wonderful Sayings
ſpoken by Joſeph Brig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,
worthy to be min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>ON the 26. day of the Fourth Month, about
the Seventh hour in the Evening, being
(as we thought) very near death, after he had
layen ſilent for about an hour, he began to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
full of exceeding great joy and pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and his mouth was opened, and he ſaid,</hi>
I ſhall praiſe the Lord, for he is only to be
praiſed: <hi>So he went on in Heavenly words in
Prayer, to the admiration of the Nurſe and
Maid that heard him; of all which they only
could remember that he ſaid in admiration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh! I have never heard of any other
God but thee, O my Holy One.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the Nurſe offering him ſome Cordial
to drink,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:33776:5"/>
Nay ſaid he, I ſhall not eat nor drink
until I have ſeen my Heavenly Fathers
Face in Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And more and more he was changed and
filled with exceeding great joy and pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and ſaid,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have heard of thee, but now I ſee thee
in Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And many Heavenly ſayings and expresſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
came from him, the Maid and Nurſe
did think he had been neer going away: He
hearing them ſpeak ſo, He earneſtly ſaid,</hi>
Pray call up my Father and Mother, for
I have ſomething to ſay to them concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
what I have ſeen of my Heavenly
Fathers Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So he went on uttering</hi> many <hi>Heavenly
Sayings and Exhortations in ſound judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
his Mother was called up, and ſeeing
him ſo greatly changed in ſo ſhort a time, ſhe
wept, and ran down ſtairs and called his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and ſeveral people that was there at that
time; and when he hears them come up, he
joyfully called out,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Father, Father, Oh Father; <hi>and held
out his hand, and ſhook his Father by the hand,
and ſaid,</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:33776:5"/>
Oh! pure and glorious is my Saviour
which hath appeared to me, and hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
me into his Kingdom: Oh! mine eye

            <p>
               <hi>His words were expreſsed in ſo great wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and power that we were all amazed at
them being alſo in Meetre for the ſpace of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
one hour and a half praiſing God, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring
him, and his glorious power, and
Holy Order of glorified Saints and Holy
Angels, and of the Glorious day of God

words he gave forth to us are as followeth,
viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O moſt Glorious God, great and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
things are brought to paſs by thy
own pure holy power, by which thou haſt
revealed thy Son unto us thy Miniſters,
O my King, O let all people fear and
ſtand in awe of thy power, by which thou
haſt gathered many out of their ſinful
waies into pure obedience to thee: Oh,
thou haſt given us a living knowledge of
thee, O pure, glorious, holy God, let thy

my King, whoſe appearance is very
glorious at this day, and of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
no end is to be; but thouſands of
thouſands, millions of thouſands ſhall
come to ſee, and be made with me parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of his glorious bright-ſhining-day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Of which many words more he ſpake which
cannot be remembred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again he ſaid,</hi> O Glory, Glory, Everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
praiſes be given to thee by me, and
all we that know thee; O I have much
to ſay for thee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He was asked if he knew what he had ſaid?
his anſwer was,</hi> I have Preached the Goſpel
to You.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Father deſired at preſent to hearken
and mind what he ſaid, and ſpake ſome of his
words to them but he was grieved, and ſaid:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O be ſilent all fleſh and ſtand by, for we
that have ſeen thy pure mighty Glory, can
preach this Goſpel which is thy power,
and the day comes on apace, that all that
undertakes to ſpeak of thee, and obeyes
not thy power, by this power they ſhall
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:33776:6"/>
be brought to ſilence; there are many
waies and Baptiſms in the World; but oh
thou Pure, Holy, Holy one; we thy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
have known thy Spiritual baptiſm
into Chriſt Jeſus my Lord, by which the
living water have we known and felt. Oh
it is indeed exceeding pure, by which we
have been waſhed from all our ſins. Oh my
King thou waſt ſlain, and by the Virtue of
thy pure Blood, we have this gain, Oh that
all may wait continually upon thee, that
they may be kept from all the deceivable
waies of this world; Oh mind and ſerve
the Lord in your day for his Holy Truth
revealed in You is the way in which You
muſt Wait and Obey. Oh! Glorious
are the beams of his Sun that hath ſhined
into my Heart, in which I have ſeen the
glory of his day, although in the Grave
ſhortly this Body is to lie. But oh Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
Glory, and Hallelujah's my Soul doth
ſing to thee Oh my King for the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of my Soul, that ſhall never dye; but
in praiſes pure for ever ſhall endure; a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

which to me are dear; Yet a Glory I have

his pure face; Oh all obey his pure truth
in Your Day,</p>

               <l>That You may feel the virtue of his

            <p>
               <hi>Some were whiſpering together towards the
further end of the room, at which he ſeemed
to be grieved, and ſaid theſe words, pointing
with his finger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is a ſpirit ſpeaks in this Room
that is not of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He was ſo much ſpent he could hardly
Speak, and bid the people that ſtood by ſtand

lay ſilent a while, but again ſpake as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth:</hi>

Springs of his Love to my Soul: All that
know the Lord be obedient to his power,
and he will diſcover himſelf more to you,
and you ſhall know more, thouſands, thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
millions will the Lord call: O that
my kindred after the fleſh might come to
know the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again after ſome time of ſilence he
ſaid,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh that my Fellows, my Companions
might know the Lord, they ſhall know
the Lord, they ſhall follow me: Here be
ſome ſtand by me that do not know the
Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which he repeated again and again, and
then ſaid,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:33776:8"/>
What wait you to hear? what do you
all ſtand here to hear?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Father anſwered him, they ſtand to
hear what the Lord will ſpeak by thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſaid no, all that are here do not wait
to hear the Lord ſpeak; you do not all
know the Lord, you think you know him;
but you know him but in the notion, but
when you come to die, you ſhall know that
you did not know the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When ſome ſpake of his being light-headed,
and as though he should ſpeak he knew not
what, he ſeemed grieved, and earneſtly ſaid,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had rather be torn alive by Doggs,
than that an impure or unholy Word
ſhould come out of my mouth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Some that knew him very well, wondered to
hear him ſpeak as he did, and ſaid they had
never heard ſuch words come from him before;
he ſaid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord hath fully made that known
to my Soul which I had ſome feeling of
before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>On the next Day about the Seventh Hour
in the morning he was very earneſt in Prayer
ſoftly to himſelf; but ſome words were heard,
viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:33776:8"/>
O let all that know not thy pure truth
come and receive it ſaith my Soul.</p>
            <p>And ſung of the Olive-tree, and the
Fruit thereof which he had fed on, and of
his refreſhment he had thereby.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He was asked what he meant by the Olive-Tree?</hi>
he ſaid the Tree of Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And many more Heavenly Sayings he utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
before he Departed to his Everlaſting
Reſt.</hi>
