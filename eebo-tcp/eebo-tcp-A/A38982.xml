            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>HARK now, methinks I hear a diſmal Cry,</l>
               <l>As if ſome fatal Tragedy drew nigh:</l>
               <l>Alas, What means this tingling in my Ears</l>
               <l>Theſe doleful Sounds, that fill my Breaſt with Cares.</l>
               <l>The fatal <hi>Omen</hi> muſt protend ſome Ill;</l>
               <l>Surely ſome ſacred Saint to Day is fell.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Alas! It is too True, the worthy <hi>Hoare,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>This Day has lanch'd Eternity's wide Shore,</l>
                  <l>Never to riſe, till Time ſhall be no more:</l>
               </lg>
               <l>Oh! How cou'd he ſo ſoon bequeath his Breath,</l>
               <l>Without a <hi>Comet</hi> to protend his Death.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Yet ſo it is, Fate often proves unkind;</l>
               <l>To take the Beſt, and leave the Worſt behind.</l>
               <l>Let us then mourn in <hi>Eleagic</hi> Verſe,</l>
               <l>And weep in Brine ore his renowned <hi>Herſe:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>For <hi>Death,</hi> his moſt Tyranick Force imparts,</l>
               <l>That we with melting Grief may break our <hi>Hearts.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Oh! Let this Melancholy Hour be</l>
               <l>Griefs everlaſting Day of Jubilee:</l>
               <l>For he is gone untimely raviſh'd hence,</l>
               <l>Who liv'd in Love, and dy'd in Innocence:</l>
               <l>Admir'd and belov'd by all Man-kind;</l>
               <l>The poor Man's Father, and the rich Man's Friend.</l>
               <lg>
                  <l>Great was his Worth, but his Compaſſion more,</l>
                  <l>Diſpencing liberally to the Poor,</l>
                  <l>A ſort of daily Penſion from his Store:</l>

               <l>Nor was his Vertues only here confin'd;</l>
               <l>For large was the Endowments of his Mind:</l>
               <l>Stade in his Judgment, and approv'd in Sence,</l>
               <l>Fit for the Service of ſo great a Prince.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Stay daring <hi>Muſe,</hi> Oh! whither wilt thou fly;</l>
               <l>Alas thou canſt not reach his Piety,</l>
               <l>He was ſo Great, ſo Good, and yet he fell:</l>
               <l>Thus dy'd that worthy Saint who liv'd ſo well.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Weep! wring your Hands, and bitterly Lament,</l>
               <l>The Fall of this departed Innocent;</l>
               <l>And let your mournful Accents upwards fly,</l>
               <l>And with repeated Terror rend the Sky:</l>
               <l>Mourn as that Prophet mourn'd when <hi>Saul</hi> did lay,</l>
               <l>Weltring in Gore on the Mount <hi>Gilboa;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Or as that doleful Lamentation fell,</l>
               <l>In <hi>Aggamemnon</hi>'s melancholy Vale.</l>
               <l>Yet hold my <hi>Muſe,</hi> forbear thy melting Tears,</l>
               <l>Alas! He's fled above the reach of Cares;</l>

               <l>Crown'd with the fearful Labours of his Life,</l>
               <l>He's exil'd from a wretched World of Grief,</l>
               <l>To Life for ever in that bright aboad,</l>
