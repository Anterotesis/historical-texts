            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the READER.</head>
            <p>THat the Strength and Glory of <hi>France</hi> is now far more great and apparent than was that of <hi>Spain</hi> in 1588, is so visible a thing to every intelligent and unbiassed <hi>English-man,</hi> (whose Faith and Reason is not imposed upon by Interest, Faction, Prejudice, Humour, or a Spirit of Contradiction) that to use more words to prove it, than only to say it is so, would be impertinent; and therefore certainly I shall not need to urge any Arguments to convince my Country-men, that that thing which hath bin may be again.</p>
            <p>There was once a <hi>Spanish Invasion,</hi> (which Action from its success I confess was laught at then by the whole World) and there may be a <hi>French one,</hi> (though I do not pretend to prophesy) and how that may succeed is probably guessed at; in regard they are a great deal nearer us, have <hi>Calice</hi> and <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> two conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Places (once in our hands) in their Possession; have Ships and Men enough, run not that hazard of the Seas as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did, are a warlike well-experienc'd and disciplin'd People, and at this juncture have nothing to do, being at Peace upon pleasure with all <hi>Europe,</hi> so that if they should make any attempt upon us, they may reasonably have better success <hi>now</hi> than the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had <hi>then:</hi> And besides, they have a discontented Party here of <hi>Papists</hi> (upon the account of this horrid and unhappy Plot) that will undoubtedly join with them: And we all know that the Popish Gentlemen of this Nation, have bin trained up, and many of them Officers of the <hi>French</hi> Army, which may much facilitate the Conquest, as knowing all the Country. And as for their taking occasion to quarrel with us, we need not think they will want one, considering how they have dealt with their Neighbours in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Holland,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> as also their impudence some Years, since, in printing their Pretentions to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and their great Preparations now in raising of Men, buying of Corn, hiring of Vessels to bring them down to our Neighbouring Coasts, cannot certainly but be an Argument of some ill Design they have on Foot; and whether it be against <hi>us</hi> or <hi>Holland</hi> is all one, for the loss of one is the ruin of both, and the whole Protestant Interest all over <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now by all that hath bin said, we may expect the <hi>French,</hi> but I hope no true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted <hi>English-man</hi> fears them at all, (for <hi>forewarn'd forearm'd);</hi> yet if the Governor of any place should be such a Traitor to his Country, as to let the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my land or enter by consent, <hi>(for indeed French Pistols are very powerful)</hi> the Inhabitants and Souldiers may justify the killing of him, and defend themselves. Which Position I hope neither Divine nor Lawyer will deny, seeing the end of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is to preserve the People, <hi>(Salus Populi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prema Lex)</hi> and upon an Invasion People may forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <note place="margin">Common Law, see 7. <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>Brook</hi>'s Tenures 44, and 73. <hi>Fitch</hi> Protection 100. <hi>Coke 7.

So that certainly the Inhabitants of those Places that are nearest the Sea, having so much Reason and Law on their side, shall not need to have any exhortation to take care of their own, but that
<pb facs="tcp:49392:3"/>
their Prudence and Courage, both to defend their King, Themselves, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, will enspirit the rest of the Nation to assist and die with them in the opposing a Foreign Enemy; disarming all <hi>Papists</hi> at home, and securing his Majesty's Fleet in Harbour, and not to run away (as at <hi>Chatam</hi> in 1667) to the ruin of their Country, and their own shame and destruction.</p>
            <p>And now for my part, my only design in publishing this, is to secure the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment establish'd by Law, and not to stir up Rebellion, it being only calculated for the highest and most urgent Necessity the People can ever be drove to, which is an <hi>Invasion;</hi> neither do I believe that any Person will censure the Contents of these Sheets, except some Sycophant Persons, who by their impertinent Discourse teach <hi>Passive Obedience,</hi> and publickly affirm, that absolute Monarchy is <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> and that there is no such thing as <hi>Property</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> but all is at the Will of the Prince: Nay, tho an Enemy should invade us, yet we must not defend our selves without special Order. But such Doctrine as this will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve us: It is not crying, when we are fallen into the Ditch, <hi>Lord help us,</hi> but we must use the utmost of our endeavours to get out thereof, God now working by Means, not by Miracles; and such kind of designing (as well as silly) Rascals as these, being influenced by the Iesuits and Popish Clergie, are as great Traitors to their Prince, as to their Country, and will endeavour to help forward a <hi>French Conquest,</hi> and introduce Popery here, which the whole Nation is bound to oppose: But it is hoped, one time or other, a Law will be made to hinder such destructive Principles here (as it is in <hi>Holland)</hi> upon pain of being severely punished: For as he is certainly a great Rogue that would endeavour in the least to take away any part of the King's just Prerogative; so he is in the same quality, who would in the least give away and betray the <hi>Property</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> of the Subject.</p>
            <p>But thanks be to God we live under a most gracious and good Prince (for the preservation of whose Life we ought constantly to pray) who hath by his Promises, Proclamations, and his late most approved choice of some Members of his Privy-Council, as a Committee for the further examination of the Plot, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us sufficient and satisfactory assurance of his great care for the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> and our preservation. But notwithstanding all, his Neighbour being Great, Powerful, Ambitious, and Designing, may also be False, and of a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den pour those Forces upon us, that will otherwise pull him out of 'his own Throne if he hath no employment for them; and therefore this Treatise is only given you as a Remedy or Medicament towards half your Cure; and that if his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's Life should be taken away by any violent means, (which God of Heaven forbid) and an Enemy should take that opportunity of our Sadness and Divisions to invade us, you know how to receive them both by Land and Sea, and what Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials are useful towards either offending our Enemy, or defending our Selves. But that which will be most necessary of all, <hi>is a Union of Hearts and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> which that God would make upon such an occasion more especially, is no doubt the hearty and constant Prayers of those who have often fought (and will still to the last drop of their Blood) for their King and Country.</p>

               <hi>OR,</hi> A brief Discourse what Orders were best for repulsing of Foreign Forces, if at any time they should invade us by Sea, in <hi>Kent</hi> or elsewhere. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in Writing to the Right Honourable <hi>Robert Dudley,</hi> Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> a little before the <hi>Spanish Invasion</hi> in 88, by <hi>Thomas Diggs</hi>
               <abbr> Esq</abbr> Muster-Master General of all her Majesty's Forces in the <hi>Low Countries.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe accustomed Order hath bin by Firing of Beacons to put the Shire in Arms, and presently all Forces to repair to the Landing-place, there without delay to give them Battel. But because there are other Opinions, I think it first conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to set down the Reasons of each Opinion, and then a Resolution what I find best. Such as maintain this old accustomed Order, alleage, besides the good success that many times it hath taken; that in Reason also it is best dealing with the Enemy at Landing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath firm footing, and before he shall have leasure to range his Men in due Order or Battel, and before he shall be able to Land his Ordnance, Horse, and Carriages; and that a very few Men thus in time shall be able to give greater annoyance, and do greater Service upon the Enemy, than ten times so many when the Enemy is Landed, and setled in strength of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, with all his Horse, Ordnance, and Carriages. They also add these Reasons ensuing for confirmation of their custom.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Reasons.</head>
               <p>First, The fury of the Country upon the first firing of the Beacons is great, every Man, <hi>pro Aris &amp; Focis,</hi> violently running down to the Sea-side to repel the disordered Enemy at the first confused landing; which fury if we suffer to grow cold, we shall not so easily enflame again.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Every Man knoweth how great advantage they have, that have firm footing on Land, to encounter an Enemy that must land out of Boats, in a confused stragling manner, and therefore more willingly and speedily will go to enjoy the Benefit of this Advantage; whereas if you suffer the Enemy to land, and put himself into Military Order, he becometh more terrible unto us.</p>
               <p>Also, while the Enemy is landing, if he find any Difficulty or Danger, being in Boats, they are ready to retire to their Ships again; but if they be once landed, with their Artillery, Horse, Carriages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is not possible for them to retire to their Ships again, without extreme danger of their Lives upon the Retreat, and the dishonourable Loss of all their Munition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore Necessity enforcing them to fight, and all hope of Escape by
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49392:4"/>
flight being taken away from them, they become ten times more dangerous Enemies to deal withal than before.</p>
               <p>Further, there is in this Realm (as in all States divided in Religion) no small Numbers of Traiterous Minds, who having time to confer, and seeing an Enemy of Force already landed, may and will then discover their Malice, which on a sudden they dare not, nor cannot.</p>

               <p>Some others hold this old Custom of running to the Sea-side to be a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Custom, void of Order and Warlike Discipline, very perillous to our selves, not hurtful to the Enemy, but rather a means to lose all; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with, by especial Commandment that Order of Repair to the Sea-side be restrained, and the Enemy suffered to land quietly; and in the mean time to drive and carry away all Cattel, Victual, Forage, Carriage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and certain Places of Assembly appointed a good distance off the Sea, from whence they may march in Warlike Order, and so by driving and carrying away all Victuals, and fortifying of all Streights and Passages, to weary the Enemy with Time. And these be the Reasons for maintenance of this second Opinion.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Reasons of the second Opinion.</head>
               <p>First, It is said, the invading Enemy bringeth a select Company of disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd and well trained Souldiers, whom we seek to encounter with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused Multitude of Men untrained, in which Match there is no Comparison, but Loss certain.</p>
               <p>Again, it is said, An Enemy of Force meaning to land, will do it in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite of us, and then the Country offering to repell him, and finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves not able, grow much more fearful, than if quietly without resistance we had suffered the Enemy to land.</p>
               <p>Again, while we suffer the Enemy to land, we may drive away all Cattel and Provision further into the Country, and then maintain Streights and Passages, well fenced and fortified, so as the Enemy shall be forced to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach us upon our own Strengths and Fortifications, to his great Peril and Danger.</p>
               <p>Again they say, If in this manner we keep Victuals from them by Land, and her Majesty's Navy also in the mean time keeping the Seas, the Enemy for want of Victuals only shall be forced to retire, and glad to withdraw himself.</p>
               <p>Further, it is alledged, how doubtful a thing Battel is, and how dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous for a King to commit his Crown upon it, and therefore that tempori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Course extolled.</p>
               <p>These I think be the Reasons most effectual to impugn the speedy Repair to the Sea-side, and to maintain the Opinion of suffering the Enemy to land quietly, and by driving and carrying away Victuals and Forage, and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sying of Streights and Passes, by Time and Famine to weary the Enemy.</p>
               <p>But having attentively weighed the Reasons on both sides, and by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of former Invasions, examining the Success and Sequel of the like Attempts, as I am far from allowing of any confused disorderly running to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49392:4"/>
the Sea-side, to encounter a select, trained, well disciplined Enemy invading: so am I also utterly against that second Opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> to suffer the Enemy quietly to land all his Forces, Munition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not doubting but a mean Course, far more serviceable than either of them both, may be taken, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Benefit of that old Custom may be embraced, and the Disorders of the other well noted may be reformed, and no Advantage to annoy the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Enemy omitted; as by these Reasons ensuing better may be judged.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Reasons.</head>
               <p>First, I say, one of the chiefest Forces of this famous Island of <hi>England,</hi> consisteth in this, That it is fortified naturally with such a Trench or Ditch, as the Sea is, whereby it is not so subject to Invasion, as other Countries lying on the Main: Which singular Benefit, and peculiar Advantage of this our Country is utterly lost, if we suffer the Enemy quietly to land all his Forces, Munition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to take firm footing quietly on the Main.</p>
               <p>Again, Whereas this noble Island hath such a Number of Mariners, and good Shipping, both of her Majesty's Royal Navy, and also of Merchants, as may hope with good Success to encounter on Sea the Force of any Foreign Enemy, we lose a great part of this our chief Strength, if relying on this second Opinion, we should suffer the Enemy quietly to land, and then tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porize afterwards.</p>
               <p>Again, There is no Man of any mean experience, but knoweth with what danger Men land out of Boats, if there be but any mean Force before Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to resist them; for if therewhile any Storm arise, the Sea alone fighteth for us, and with any small Resistance on Land, will drown great Numbers of our invading Enemies.</p>
               <p>Also any small Trench on Land shall lodge Shot in safety, to spoil as many of our Enemies, as in Boats shall offer to land, before they can approach the Shore.</p>
               <p>Also in landing, before they can have time to put themselves in Order, what an Execution may a far less Number of Bills, or Swords, and Targets, do on them, before they shall have time to unite their Forces.</p>
               <p>Again, After the Remnant shall land, if they be not all drowned, slain, or repelled in or before their Landing, how easy a matter shall it be for a few Lances, joined with the Weapons aforesaid, to put such a confused, dispersed, scattered, Sea-beaten Company to the Sword, before they shall ever be able to advance Standard, or put themselves in Order of Battel.</p>
               <p>Besides all this, if her Majesty's Forces by Sea should not in time be assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled of such Strength, as to be able before landing to give them Battel; yet any mean Force assailing their Ships, while their Men are in landing, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but greatly annoy them, if not utterly defeat them.</p>
               <p>Also in most places, except the Enemy bring his Tide justly with him, he cannot land, and then if part land, and any mean resistance made, to give Impediment to the rest, till the Tide pass, their divided Forces may more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily be defeated.</p>
               <p>Again, It is no small time that is requisite to land an Army, with Horse, Carriages, Ordnance, Munition, and Victuals, without which an Invader shall never be able to prevail; and then if any mean resistance be made at the landing, it much prolongeth the same time; so as any Storm happening, the Winds, Tides, Shelves, Rocks, Bars, and Seas fight for us, wholly in our favour, and to the ruin of our Enemy. And therefore I utterly disallow
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49392:5"/>
that Opinion to give the Enemy leave quietly to land, and then by device to temporize afterward.</p>
               <p>Further, If such a Resolution by the Prince and State be taken, that the invading Enemy should be suffered to land quietly, to spoil and burn at their pleasure, and the inward Forces of the Country not permitted, even at their first landing, to come to their rescue, it would cause no doubt all the Inhabitants of the Coast to abandon their Towns, and leave the Frontiers naked and desolate, which the wise Kings and grave Counsellors of this Land have ever fought to make populous, by granting many Privileges and Immunities to allure Inhabitants on the Frontiers.</p>
               <p>But touching driving or carrying away of Victuals, and leaving the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try waste, and thereby to famish our landed Enemy, it is a thing more easily wished than performed. I confess, in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where most of their Substance consisteth of Kine, it is easily done; but in this rich and wealthy Country of <hi>England,</hi> it is not possible but that the Enemy, if he be once landed with all his Forces, shall find Houses full of Provision, and Barns full of all kind of Forage and Corn all the Country over, unless our Prince should command all to be wasted with Fire; which Precedent we see seldom or never put in ure, neither in these late Wars of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> nor in any former Invasions that we read of; for it would make the Prince odious, and alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate extremely the Subjects Minds, and therefore not to be used but upon great extremities, when all other Means fail.</p>
               <p>And here in <hi>England,</hi> above all other Countries, it may worst be done; for our Towns are poor, weak, unprovided, and unfortified, the Country full of Habitation, populous, rich, and abundant of all Commodities. In the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> by reason of the great store of their strong well-fortified Towns, they might much more easily drive and carry to their Cities at hand all Victual and Forage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet when the last great Armies of the States and <hi>Don Iohn</hi> were in the Field, notwithstanding all the Boors and Country-People were fled and retired to the next walled Towns, and had knowledg long before of the approaching of the Armies, yet were they not able so to drive and carry away the Victuals and Forage, but that the Enemy found Barns full in every place, in such sort as we never were forced at any time to forage four Miles from our Camp: So difficult and impossible a thing it is to carry away Victuals and Forage, or to leave the Enemy a waste Country. But if here in <hi>England</hi> we should drive or carry away our Victuals or Forage to the next walled Towns, the Enemy being quietly landed with his Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, should have his chief desire, knowing not only how weak and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortified our Towns are, but also how unprovided for all Necessaries to abide a Siege, if Fortification on sudden could be made. Wherefore I could wish all provident Means used to give the Enemy annoyance before and at the Landing, and by no means to suffer him to land quietly, or to trust to that temporizing Course, which is rather to be practised when all other Means fail, than to be relied upon at the beginning.</p>
               <p>I grant it perillous for a Defendent Prince to hazard his Crown on a Battel, and more dangerous for Men untrained to encounter expert disciplin'd Souldiers, and most perillous to us that have no strong Towns to make head, if we lose a Battel: Aad therefore it is no part of my meaning to wish our Prince to give any Invading Enemy Battel with all our Forces, how well prepared and ordered soever we should be. But my meaning is, to have such Provision in every Shire, as we may be able readily on any sudden to give the Enemy all annoiance possible, before and at the Landing, while
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49392:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the inward Forces of our Country may the better assemble, and put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in Military Order, to proceed after as shall be found most convenient.</p>
               <p>And therefore to avoid as well confused Assemblies of our own Forces, as also to be able, like Souldiers, orderly to annoy the Enemy, by all means at the landing, and nevertheless to reserve all Advantages of temporizing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, if we should not defeat or repell them at or before the landing, these Notes ensuing I would wish to be considered.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Notes to be remembred in the Musters and Ordering of Men hereafter.</head>
               <p>First, That all bad Armor, Weapons, and Furniture, be defaced or taken away, and such new provided as may be serviceable; and this to be better executed, without favour, indifferently on all degrees.</p>
               <p>That better Consideration be had of selecting or enrolling of Souldiers, that only active and able Bodies be appointed for Weapon, the rest for Pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers or Labourers; and that such Labourers be enjoined also to have in readiness their Spade, Shovel, or Pickax with them, accordingly as at the Musters shall be appointed. These well directed, shall do service with the best in the Field. I would not have them denied, but rather allowed every Man also his light Pike, or Black-Bill, to execute when Time shall serve.</p>
               <p>That good regard be had to maintain still full Numbers of armed Pikes, for as we grow by Wealth more delicate, we shall seek generally with the <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>French</hi> to leave that Weapon, and thereby greatly weaken the Forces of our Land.</p>
               <p>That some Games be erected in several places in every Shire of <hi>England,</hi> to allure Men to shoot in Muskets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to bestow their Bullets surely; for the usual manner of Training by wasting Powder is ridiculous, and no Service in the World in it.</p>
               <p>But especially that Provision be made of one kind of Weapon and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viture, that in all our former Musters hath bin omitted, and in my Opinion ought specially above all others to be provided in all Shires fronting on the Sea, where Invasion may be made, I mean the Argoleteir.</p>
               <p>These Argoleteirs need no such chief Horse, as the Lance, or Man at Arms, but every mean Gelding and ordinary Hackney will serve this purpose, whereby it shall be more easy to have in readiness a thousand of these Argo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leteirs than an hundred sufficient Lances. And yet would I have most part of their Horses such, as were able for four or five Miles, when need shall be, to take up and carry a Foot-Shot or Musquetier behind him; and so shall they be able for repelling sudden Invasions, to do singular Service, being well directed, and far above any other heretofore in our Musters provided.</p>
               <p>The Pioneers or Labourers also, being great Numbers, will always readily be at hand to cast Trenches, or make Sconces, to lodge Shot in Safety to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy the Enemy, and fortify Streights and Passages; and finally, when time is, on the scattering or flying Enemy to do execution also.</p>
               <p>It shall not be difficult in every Shire to find some such two or three places of Assembly, within a few miles of the Coast, as may discover the Enemy on the Sea far off, and plainly perceive on what part he meaneth to land, from whence Supplies accordingly may be sent.</p>
               <p>And first I would wish of those Argoleteirs, and Shot on foot, some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Companies be sent to the Coast, and Order given, that all the Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of those parts should attend on them, to make Trenches or Sconces to stay the Enemy, as they should be directed; in which time the armed Pikes,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49392:6"/>
accompanied with Lances, may have space to range themselves in Order Military, without confusion or disorder, to march towards the Enemy. And if these Argoleteirs and other Shot should happen by the Enemy to be repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, yet by the aid of the Labourers of the Country, they may retire in such sort from one Strength to another, as the Enemy with great loss shall very slowly follow them.</p>
               <p>And forasmuch as <hi>Kent</hi> is the most likely Shire of all other for many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects to be attempted, whensoever any Invasion shall be by Sea, it were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite before-hand by Men of Skill to have the Landing-Places well survey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and convenient Places of Assembly appointed, and all Passages or Streights well considered, that good direction may be given where to assemble, and how to proceed upon any sudden, when occasion shall require. For at this present, not only among the common sort of ignorant Captains, but even among some of good Judgment and Experience, if such an occasion should suddenly happen, there would be found such repugnance of Opinions, as perhaps the worst and most perillous Resolution might be taken. In other Arts Errors are not so dangerous, but upon better deliberation they may be corrected; but in these Military Causes, especially in matter of Invasion, an erroneous Resolution at the first may utterly overthrow the <hi>State</hi> for ever. I would wish this Matter, of so great Importance effectually considered, before imminent Danger, while Time is. And so is there no doubt (the natural Fortification of this Island considered) with the great store of Shipping and Mariners, and the abundance of Armor and Weapon now in <hi>England,</hi> and able Bodies also to use them, if they were duly trained and exercised; but we may with good Order repell the Fury of all Foreign Enemies whatsoever.</p>
               <p>Thus far Mr. <hi>Diggs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now I must not omit one thing, which is to let you know that the great strength of this Kingdom lies in <hi>Chatham-</hi>River, and at <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> (and I could heartily wish all his Majesty's Ships there were in that River too). As for the first, it is sufficiently secured by the New Fortifications at <hi>Sheerness,</hi> and thereabouts; but for the latter, if an Invasion should happen in those parts, the Enemy may land at <hi>Stokes-Bay,</hi> secure <hi>Gospar</hi> with a great deal of ease, destroy the Navy there, and beat down the Town of <hi>Portsmouth</hi> about their Ears; therefore that Bay ought to be secured upon the first Alarm.</p>
               <p>I would have given you a List of the last thirty Ships, but that they are not all yet finished, but when they are, will make the most glorious Fleet in the World.</p>
