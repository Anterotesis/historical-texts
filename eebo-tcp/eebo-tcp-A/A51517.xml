            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My LORD.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE abundance of indulgent Favours I have received from your Lordſhip, and the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Family to which you are now ally'd; made me preſume, humbly to crave your kind Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of this Firſt Fruits of a <hi>Young Muſe:</hi> And tho I cannot aſſure my ſelf of deſerving ſo great an
<pb facs="tcp:55084:3"/>
Encouragement as your <hi>Lordſhip's</hi> Eſpouſal of this Trifle; yet I will, to my utmoſt Endeavours, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the World, how much a generous Patronage may encreaſe a natural Genius, and that an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Beginning may, by the Aſſiſtance of ſo great a Perſon extreamly improve it ſelf.</p>
            <p>For what bold Cenſurer (tho never ſo Maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) dares queſtion what your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> takes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Protection: Safe, I'm ſure, it will remain, as plac'd upon an Altar: And indeed, when I call to mind how many, leſs deſerving than your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> have been ſtiled <hi>Hero's,</hi> and <hi>Demi-Gods,</hi> it makes me accuſe the Ingratitude of our Age, and call much in Queſtion its Judgment.</p>
            <p>Give me leave, my <hi>Lord,</hi> but to call to mind (tho far too worthy for my Pen) the famous, and never to be enough praiſed Actions of your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, the <hi>Douglaſſes,</hi> whoſe perſonal Valours have always been ſo great, that they ſeem'd the Souls of Armies, as having Life only where they charged: And whatſoever Quarrel they eſpous'd, Victory al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways dwelt there: Their Courages were ſuch, that what is in ancient Legends of others Romantick, was really juſtly true of them.</p>
            <p>And ſince they are gone to encreaſe the Number of the <hi>Hero's</hi> above, who does not ſee the true Image of their Souls in your <hi>Lordſhips:</hi> Every thing you undertake muſt have Succeſs, for what you do is with ſuch a noble Aſſurance, that Fortune ſeems afraid to contradict it; and you carry her with you
<pb facs="tcp:55084:3"/>
always bound, and in Subjection to your Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Indeed every thing in you is Extraordinary: To witneſs only your firſt early Valour with a Perſon of Honour, which ſhew'd an Example of your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Niceneſs in Gallantry, and was the true Teſt of Courage.</p>
            <p>Give me leave to add to the reſt of the Virtues, the Loyalty of your ſelf and Family; the never to be forgotten Tranſactions (now freſh in Memory) of your Two illuſtrious Relations, the Dukes of <hi>Hamilton;</hi> One ſacrificed for his Prince, by the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous and deteſtable Rebels; and the other, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of his Life in ſo meritorious a Cauſe, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in endeavouring the late King's Reſtauration.</p>
            <p>And tho their Sufferings are as well ſet forth as an original Collection, and an ingenious Hiſtorio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher could well model: Yet the ſecret Virtues of that ineſtimable Pair, which, but themſelves, and the glorious Martyr they liv'd and dy'd for, knew: Imagination cannot reach, of if known, 'twould tire Fame to ſound 'em.</p>
            <p>And ſtill to add to your Never-dying Name: This laſt happy Union, with a Family of ſuch Worth, that Fortune ſeem'd proud of the Match, and contrived it as an Honour to both Parties.</p>
            <p>What a vaſt Happineſs do I enjoy that have a Perſon of ſo unparallell'd a Family as your <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> to countenance my feeble Endeavours; and tho the Worthies of the World might juſtly claim the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour I ſue for; yet, as the <hi>Widdow's Mite</hi> was
<pb facs="tcp:55084:4"/>
acceptable, ſo may this poor Performance be to your <hi>Lordſhip's</hi> unbounded Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>Perhaps ſome <hi>Momuſes</hi> of this Time, may imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately (without farther Thought) decry this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and call it Flattery; but thoſe that will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially judge, muſt own that Flattery and Truth were never ally'd; and I have ſaid nothing here but what the well-known Merits of the Perſons will juſtify.</p>
            <p>May the noble Partner of your Heart live like her Virtues, which were a ſufficient Security (if Heaven would ſuffer her Abſence) for an Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality on Earth: May the Excellencies o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <l>MY Brother <hi>Mountfort</hi> in the Scene-Room ſits,</l>
                  <l>To hear the Cenſure of your ſharp quick Wits;</l>
                  <l>Expecting a moſt dreadful damning Doom:</l>
                  <l>My Third Day's past, but his, poor Soul's to come.</l>

                  <l>But if it does, there's few of 'em are Fighters:</l>
                  <l>Thoſe that are ſo, he does exclude his Pen,</l>
                  <l>For like Town Bully, he would know his Men.</l>
               </lg>

                  <l>He would not queſtion it, and pray don't you.</l>
                  <l>The Plot I'm ſure is good, or if it be not, fye,</l>
                  <l>Your Chair-Men now a days plot Tragedy.</l>
