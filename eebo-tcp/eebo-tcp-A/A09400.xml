            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Honourable, it can not be vnknovvne to your selfe, or to any man of a daies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that it is thought a small matter to commit a sinne, or, to lie in sinns against a mans ovvne conscience. For many vvhen they are told of their dutie in this point, replie and say, <hi>What tell you me of conscience? Conscience was hanged long agoe.</hi> But vnles they take better heed, and preuent the danger by repentance, Hanged-conscience vvill revive and become both gibbet and hangman to them either in this life or the life to come. For Conscience is appointed of God to declare and put
<pb facs="tcp:10898:3"/>
in execution his iust iudgement against sinners: and as God cannot possibly be ouercome of man, so neither can the iudgement of conscience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the iudgement of God be wholly extinguished. Indeed Satan for his part goes about by al means he can, to benumme the conscience: but all is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. For as the sicke man, vvhen he seemes to sleepe and take his rest, is invvardly full of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: so the benummed and drousie conscience wants not his secret pangs and terrours; and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it shal be roused by the iudgement of God, it wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth cruell and fierce like a wild beast. Again, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man sinnes against his conscience, as much as in him lieth, he plungeth him selfe into the gulfe of desperation: for euery wound of the conscience, though the smart of it be little felt, is a deadly wound: and he that goes on to sinne against his conscience, stabbes and vvounds it often in the same place: and all renewed wounds (as we know) are hardly or neuer cured. Thirdly, he that lieth in sinnes against his conscience, cannot call vpon the name of God: for guiltie conscience makes a man flie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God. And Christ saith, <hi>God heareth not sinners,</hi> vnderstanding by sinners, such as goe on in their owne waies against conscience: and what can be more dolefull then to be barred of the invocation of Gods name? Lastly, such persons after the last iudgement, shall haue not

               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Onscience is a part of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding in all reasonable creatures, determining of their particular actions either with them or against them.</p>
            <p>I say conscience is a part of the vnderstanding, and I shew it thus. God in framing of the soule placed in it two principall faculties, <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> and <hi>Will.</hi> Vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is that facultie in the soale whereby we vse reason: and it is the more principall part seruing to rule and order the whole man, and therefore it is placed in the soule to be as the wagginer in the waggin. The Will is an other facultie, whereby we doe will or nill any thing, that is, choose or refuse it. With the will is ioyned sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie affections, as ioy, sorrow, loue, ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:10898:5"/>
whereby we imbrace or eschew that which is good or euill. Now, conscience is not placed in the affections nor will, but in the vnderstanding, because the actions thereof stand in the vse of reason. Vnderstanding againe hath two parts. The first is that which stands in the view and contemplation of <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>falshood,</hi> and goes no further. The second is that which stands in the view and consideration of euery particular action, to search whether it be <hi>good</hi> or <hi>badde.</hi> The first is called the <hi>Theorical,</hi> the second the <hi>practical vnderstanding.</hi> And vnder this latter is conscience to be comprehended: because his propertie is to iudge of the goodnes or badnes of things or actions done.</p>

This the Scriptures confirme in that they ascribe sundrie workes and actions to conscience, as accusing, excusing, comforting, terrifying. Which actions could not thence proceede, if conscience were no more but an action or act of the minde. Indeede I graunt, it may be taken for a certen actuall knowledge,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:10898:5"/>
which is the effect thereof: but to speake pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, this knowledge must proceede of a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the soule, the propertie whereof is to take the principles and conclusions of the minde and applie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; by applying either to accuse or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse. This is the ground of all, and this I take to be conscience. If it be obtected that conscience cannot be a naturall power, because it may be lost: I answer if conscience be lost, it is onely in respect of the vse thereof, as reason is lost in the drunken man, and not otherwise.</p>
            <p>I adde, that the proper subiects of conscience are reasonable creatures; that is, men and angels. Hereby conscience is excluded first of all from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Pet. 2. 19. that men must indure griese wrongfully <hi>for conscience of God,</hi> his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is not to shewe that God hath conscience, but that men are to suffer many wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs because their <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sciences</hi> do bind the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in so doing to obay Gods wil, which conscience directly respecteth.</p>

            <p>The things that conscience determines of, are a mans owne actions: his owne actions, I say. To be certen what an other man hath saide or done, is commonly called knowledge: but for a man to be certen what he himselfe hath done or saide, that is conscience. Againe consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence meddles not with generals, onely it deales in particular actions: and that, not in some fewe, but in all.</p>
            <p>The manner of consciences determination,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:10898:6"/>
is to set downe his iudgement either with the creature or against it: I adde this clause, because conscience is of a diuine nature, and is a thing placed by God in the middest betweene him and man, as an arbitratour to giue sentence and to pronounce either with man or against man vnto God. For otherwhiles, it consents and speakes with God against the man in whome it is placed: other whiles againe it consents with him and speakes for him before the Lord. And hence comes one reason of the name of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>Scire,</hi> to know, is of one man alone by himselfe: and <hi>conscire</hi> is, when two at the least know some one secret thing; either of them knowing it togither with the other. Therefore the name <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>,</hi> or <hi>Conscientia</hi> conscience, is that thing that combines two togither, and makes them partners in the knowledge of one and the same secret. Now man and man, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> man and Angel can not be combined; because they can not know the secret of any man vnlesse it be reucaled to them: it remaines therefore that this combination is onely betweene man and God. God knowes perfectly all the doings of man, though they be neuer so hid and concealed: and man by a gift giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him of God, knows togither with God, the same things of himselfe: and this gift is named Conscience.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Here we must consider three things: I. of what things conscience beares witnes: II. in what manner: III. how long.</p>
            <p>For the first, conscience beares witnesse of our thoughts, of our affections, of our outward actions.</p>
            <p>That it beares witnes of our secret thoughts, it appeares by the solemne protestation which at some time men vse <hi>In my conscience I never thought it:</hi> whereby they signifie that they think something, or they thinke it not, and that their consciences can tell what they thinke. Neither must this seeme strange. For there must be two actions of the vnderstanding, the one is simple,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:10898:7"/>
which barely conceiueth or thinketh this or that: the other is <hi>a reflecting</hi> or doubling of the former, whereby a man conceiues and thinkes with himselfe what he thinks. And this action properly pertaines to the conscience. The minde thinks a thought, now conscience goes beyond the minde, and knowes what the minde thinks; so as if a man would go about to hide his sinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thoughts from God, his conscience as an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther person within him, shall discouer all. By meanes of this second action conscience may beare witnes euen of thoughts, and from hence also it seemes to borrow his name, because con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science <note place="margin">Consci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Againe, conscience beares witnes what the wills and affections of men be in euery matter, Rom. 9. 1. <hi>I say the truth in Christ, I lie nos,</hi> my conscience <hi>bearing me witnes in the holy Ghost, that I haue great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ines and continuall sorrow in my heart: for I could wish my selfe to be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from Christ for my brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly it witnesseth what be mens actions. Eccles. 7. 24. <hi>Oftentimes also thine heart know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> [that is, conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce witnesseth] <hi>that thou like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise hast cursed others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The manner that conscience vseth in giuing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:10898:8"/>
testimonie standes in two things. First it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues and takes notice of all things that we doe: secondly, it doth inwardly and secretly within the heart, tell vs of them all. In this respect it may fitly be compared to a notarie, or a register that hath alwaies the penne in his hand, to note and record whatsoeuer is saide or done: who also because he keepes the rolles and records of the court, can tell what hath bin said and done many hundred yeares past.</p>
            <p>Touching the third point. How long consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence beares witnes, it doth it continually; not for a minut, or a day, or a moneth, or a yeare, but for euer: when a man dies, conscience dieth not; when the bodie is rotting in the graue, consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence liueth and is safe and sound: and when we shall rise againe, conscience shall come with vs to the barre of Gods iudgement, either to accuse or excuse vs before God, Rom. 2. 15. 16. <hi>Their conscience bearing witnes at the day when God shall iudge the secrets of men by Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this first dutie of conscience, we are to learne three things. The first, that there is a God: and we may be lead to the sight of this euen by very reason. For conscience beares witnesse. Of what? Of thy particular doings. But against whome or with whome doth it giue testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie? thou maist feele in thy heart that it doth it
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:10898:8"/>
either with thee or against thee. And to whom is it a witnesse? To men or Angels? that can not be, for they can not heare the voice of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they can not receiue consciences testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, nay they can not see what is in the heart of man. It remaines therefore that there is a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall substance, most wise, most holy, most mighty, that sees a I things to whom conscience beares record; and that is God himselfe. Let A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists barke against this as long as they will: they haue that in them which will convince them of the truth of the godhead will they nill they, either in life or death.</p>
            <p>Secondly we learne, that God doth watch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all men by a speciall prouidence. The master of a prison is knowen by this to haue care ouer his prisoners, if hee send keepers with them to watch them and to bring them home againe in time convenient: and so Gods care to man is manifest in this, that when he created man and placed him in the worlde, he gaue him consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be his keeper to follow him alwaies at the heeles &amp; to dogge him (as we say) &amp; to pry into his actions &amp; to beare witnesse of them all.</p>
            <p>Thirdly hence we may obserue Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and loue to man. If he do any thing amisse, he sets his conscience first of all to tell him of it sec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>edy: if then he amende, God forgives it: if
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:10898:9"/>
not, then afterward conscience must openly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse him for it at the barre of Gods iudgement before all the saints and angels in heauen.</p>
            <p>The second worke of conscience is to giue iudgement of things done.</p>
            <p>To giue iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is to determine, that a thing <note place="margin">

                  </gap>. Of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>dgement.</note> is well done or ill done. Herein conscience is like to a Iudge that holdeth an assize and takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of inditements, and causeth the most notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous malefactour that is to hold up his hand at the barre of his iudgement. Nay it is (as it were) a little god sitting in the middle of mens hearts arraigning them in this life as they shall be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned for their offences at the tribunall seate of the euerliuing god in the day of iudgement. Wherfore the temporary iudgement that is giuen by the conscience is nothing els but a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning or a fore-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>unner of the last iudgement.</p>
            <p>Hence we are admonished to take special heed that nothing past lie heavy upon vs, &amp; that we charge not our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sciences in time to come with any matter. For if our conscience accuse us, god will much more condemne vs, saith S. Iohn. 1. Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. 3. 18. because he seeth all our actions more clearely and iudgeth them more seuerely then conscience can. It shall be good therfore for all men to labour that they may say with Paul, 2. Cor. 4. <hi>I knovv nothing by my selfe,</hi> that they

               </gap>st we must consider two things: first, the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>se that makes conscience giue iudgement: secondly, the manner how.</p>

            <p>Conscience is said to be bound as it is conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a part by it selfe from the binding power of gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement.

            <p>The second time was from the ascension of Christ, till about the time of the destruction of the Temple and city: in which, ceremonies cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to bind conscience and remained indifferent. Hereupon Paul circumcised Timothy: the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles after Christs ascension, as occasion was offered were present in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>emple, Act. 3. 1: And the councill of Hierusalem tendering the weakenesse of some beleeuers, decreed that the Church for a time should abstaine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> strangled &amp; blood And there was good reason of this,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:10898:15"/>
because the Church of the Iewes was not yet sufficiently conuicted that an end was put to the ceremoniall law by the death of Christ.</p>
            <p>In the third time, which was after the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of the Gospell; ceremonies of the Iewes Church became unlawfull, and so shall continue to the worlds end.</p>
            <p>By this it appeares what a monstrous and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable religion the Church of Rome teacheth and maintaines; which standes wholy in cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, partly heat heathenish and partly Iewish.</p>
            <p>As for the Gospel, I take it for that part of the word of God which promiseth righteousnesse <note place="margin">§7. Of the Gospell bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> and life euerlasting to all that beleeue in Christ, and withall commandeth this faith.</p>
            <p>That we may the better know, how the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell binds conscience, two points must be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered: one touching the persons bound, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther touching the manner of binding.</p>
            <p>Persons are of two sorts; some be called, some be uncalled. Persons called are all such to whom God in mercy hath offered the meanes of salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and hath reuealed the doctrine of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell in some measure more or lesse by meanes either ordinary or extraordinary. All such I thinke are straightly bounde in conscience to beleeue and obey the Gospell. For that word of God, whereby men shall be iudged in the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:10898:15"/>
day of iudgement, must first of all binde their consciences in this life, considering absolution and condemnation is according to that which is done in this life: but by the Gospell, all men that haue beene called, shall be iudged as Paul saith, Roman. 2. 16. <hi>God shall iudge the secrets of men by Iesus Christ, according to my Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</hi> And our Sauiour Christ saieth, <hi>Hee that beleeveth hath life everlasting, hee vvhich beleeveth not is alreadie condemned.</hi> It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines therfore, that the gospell binds the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of such men in this life. By this wee are all put in minde not to content our selues with this, that wee haue a liking to the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and doe beleeue it to be true (though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny protestants in those our dayes thinke it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oth in life and death, if they holde that they are to be saved by faith alone in Christ without the merite of mans workes) but wee must goe yet further, and enter into a practise of the doctrine of the Gospell as well as of the precepts of the morall lawe; knowing that the gospell doeth as well binde conscience as the lawe, and if it be not obeyed will as well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne.</p>
            <p>Men vncalled, are such as neuer hearde of Christ by reason the gospell was neuer reuealed unto them, nor means of reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> offered. That
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:10898:16"/>
there haue bene such in former ages, I make it manifest thus. The worlde since the creation may be distinguished into foure ages. The first, from the creation to the floode: the second, from the flood to the giuing of the Lawe: the third, from the giuing of the law to the death of Christ: the fourth, from the death of Christ to the last iudgement. Now in the three for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages, there was a distinction of the world into two so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>It may be and is obiected, that if euery man be bound in conscience to beleeue his owne Election and saluation by Christ, then some men are bound to beleeue that which is false, because some there be euen in the middest of the Church, which in the counsell of God were neuer chosen to saluation. I answeare, that this reason were good, if men were bound absolutely to beleeue their saluation without further respect or condition: but the bond is conditionall, according to the tenour of the couenant of grace; for we are bound to beleeue in Christ, if we would come to life euerlasting, or if we would be in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of God, or if we would be good disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and members of Christ.</p>
            <p>In that we are bound in conscience on this manner to beleeue the promises of the Gospell with an application of the benefites
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:10898:21"/>
thereof to our selues, sundrie necessarie and profitable points of instruction may be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. The first, that the popish Doctours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolish a great part of the Gospel, when they teach that men are bound to beleeue the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel onely by a Catholicke saith, which they make to be nothing else but a gift of God, or illumination of the minde, whereby assent is giuen to the word of God that it is true; and more specially that Iesus is Christ, that is, an all-sufficient Sauiour of mankinde. All which the damned spirits beleeue: whereas the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel for the comfort and saluation of mens soules hath a further reach, namely to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne men to beleeue that the promise of saluation is not onely true in it selfe, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so true in the very person of the beleeuer, as appeares euidently by the Sacraments which are as it were a visible Gospel, in which Christ with all his benefits is offered and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the particular persons of men: to this ende, no doubt, that they might beleeue the accomplishment of the promise in themselues.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we learne that it is not presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for any man to beleeue the remission of his owne sinnes: for to doe the will of God to which we are bound, is not to presume: now it is the will of God to which he hath
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:10898:22"/>
bound vs in conscience, to belo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ion of our owne sinnes: and therefore rather <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> to doe it is p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

As for Evangelicall commandements, they haue this priuiledge, that they may and can be performed according to the intention of the Lawgiuer in this life: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause with the commandement is ioyned the inward operation of the spirit, to inable vs to effect the dutie commaunded: and the will of God is not to require absolute perfection at our hands in the Gospel as in the law: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to qualifie the rigour of the law by the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:10898:22"/>
of a mediatour in our steads and of vs (we beeing in Christ) to accept the vpright will and indeauour for the deede; as the will to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and the will to beleeue, for repentance and true faith indeede. Now then if things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the Gospel, be both ordinarie and possible, then for a man to haue an unfallible certaintie of his owne saluation, is both ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry &amp; possible. But more of this point afterward.</p>
            <p>Lastly, all such persons as are troubled with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, distrustings, vnbeleefe, dispaire of Gods mercie, are to learne and consider that God by his word bindes them in conscience to be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ue the pardon of their owne sinnes be they neuer so grieuous or many, and to be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>hat are but civill haue care to auoid rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and killing, because God giues commaundements against stealing and killing: why then should not we much more striue against our manifold doubtings and distrustings of Gods loue in Christ, hauing a commandement of God that calls vpon vs and binds vs to doe so.</p>
            <p>Thus we see how Gods word bindes consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences now conscience being thus bound, againe bindes vs.</p>
            <p>The bonde of conscience is called <hi>Guiltines. Guiltines</hi> is nothing els but a worke of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,

            <p>The improper binder is that which hath no power or vertue in it selfe to binde conscience: but doth it onely by vertue of Gods word or of some part of it. It is threefold, Humane lawes, an Oath, a Promise.</p>

Therefore the words alleadged doe not giue vnto the priest a soveraigne power of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king lawes, but a power of giuing iudgement of controuersies, and that according to lawes alreadie made by God himselfe: from which iudgement there might be no appeale.

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:10898:25"/>
a new lawe not for this or that respect, but sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to binde consciences of the Gentils that they might be exercised in obedience. And this is prooued because the Apostles call this lawe a <hi>burden,</hi> and call the things prescribed <hi>necessary,</hi> and S. Luke tearmes them, the <hi>commandements of the Apostles:</hi> and Chrysostome calls the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle sent to the Church, <hi>Imperium,</hi> that is, a lordly charge. To this they adde, the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Tertullian, Origen, Augustine. <hi>Answ.</hi> Though all be granted that the law is a burden imposed, a precept of the Apostles, a charge, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine that things required therein are necessary: yet will it not follow by good consequent, that the lawe simply bindes conscience: because it was giuen with a reseruation of Christian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, so as out of the case of scandall, that is, if no offence were giuen to the weake Iewes, it might freely be omitted. And that will appeare by these reasons. First of all Peter saith, that it is a tempting of God, to impose upon the Gentiles the yoke of Iewish ceremonies: hee therefore must needs be contrary to himselfe if he intend to binde mens consciences to abstinence from strangled, blood, and things offered to idols. A reply is made, that this abstinence is prescribed not by the ancient law of Moses, but by a new Ecclesiasticall or Apostolicall authority. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:10898:25"/>
againe, that a Mosaicall ceremony is still the same thing though it be stablished by a new authority. And wheras Christ by his death put an end to the ceremoniall lawe, it is absurde to thinke that the Apostles by their authority re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived some part of it againe, and bound mens consciences therto. Secondly the Church of god in all places suffered this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement to cease, which the faithful seruants of God would neuer haue done, if they had bin perswaded that this law had bound conscience simply. It is answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that this law ceased not because the giuing of offence unto the Iewes ceased, but because it ceased vniuersally: yea but it could not haue cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed universally, if it had bound conscience sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, specially considering it was propounded to the Church without any mention or limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of time. Thirdly Paul was present in this counsell and knewe the intent of this lawe very well, &amp; therefore no doubt he did not in any of his Epistles gainsay the same. This being graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it can not be, that this law should bind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science out of the case of offence. For he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Corinthians that things offered to idols <note place="margin">1. Cor. 8 9.</note> may be eaten so be it the weake<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> brother be not offended. Here it is answered that when Paul writ his first Epistle to the Corinthians, this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the Apostles touching things
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:10898:26"/>

And this action of feeding is ascribed to all Christians Revelat. 3. 27. who can not therupon chalenge a power of making lawes to the conscience.</p>
            <p>Argum. 5. Ioh. 20. <hi>As my father sent me, so I send you:</hi> but Christ was sent of his father not only with power of preaching and ministring the sacraments, but also with authority of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding and giuing iudgement. <hi>Answ.</hi> Is this kind of reasoning may stand, all the Apostles shall be made redeemers; for they were all sent as Christ was: and hee was sent not onely to preach the redemption of mankind, but also to effect and worke the same. It this be absurde,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:10898:27"/>
then it is a flat abusing of scripture to gather fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this saying of Christ, that the Apostles had po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of binding conscience because he had so. It is true indeed that there is a similitude or analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie betwene the calling of Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles; but it wholly stands in these points. Christ was ordained to his office before all worldes, &amp; so were the Apostles: Christ was called of his father immediatly, and so were they of Christ: Christ was sent to the whol worlde, &amp; so were they: Christ receiued all power in heaven and earth as beeing necessary for a mediatour; and they receiued an extraordinary authority from him with such a plentifull measure of the spirit as was necessary for the Apostolicall function. Lastly Christ was sent euen as he was man to be a teacher of the Iewes: &amp; therfore be is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the minister of circumcision, Rom. 15. 8. &amp; so the Apostles are sent by him to teach the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. Thus far is the comparison to be enlarged, &amp; no further. And that no man might imagine that some parte of this resemblance stands in a power of binding conscience, Christ hath put a speciall exception when he saith, Goe teach all nations, teaching them to obserue al things <hi>that I have commanded you.</hi>

For body &amp; goods &amp; outward co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>versation I grant all: but a subiection of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science to mans lawes, I deny. And betweene these two there is a great difference to be subiect to authority <hi>in conscience,</hi> &amp; to be subiect to it <hi>for conscience,</hi> as wil be manifest if we do but consider the phrase of the Apostle, the meaning whereof is, that we must performe obedience not onely for anger, that is, for the auoiding of punishment, but also for the auoiding of sinne, &amp; so by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequent for auoiding a breach in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>scie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Now this breach is not properly made because mans law is negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, but because Gods law is broken which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daineth magistracie, &amp; withall binds mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences to obey their lawfull commandements. And the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation that is due unto men for resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting the ordinance of God comes not by the single breach of magistrates commandemet, but by a transgression of the law of God which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth magistrates &amp; their authority.

The rod of Christ is termed a rod of iron or the rod of his mouth, &amp; it signifies that absolute &amp; soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne power which Christ hath ouer his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures wherby he is able to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uert &amp; saue them, or to forsake and destroy them. And it is a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar priuiledge of this rodde to smite and wound the conscience. The Apostolicall rodde was a certaine extraordinary power where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God inabled them to plague and punish rebellious offenders with grieuous iudgements not in their soules but in their bodies alone. With this rod Paul smote Elimas blind, &amp; Peter smote Ananias and Saphira with bodily death. And it may be that Paul by this power did giue up the incestuous man when he was excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, to be vexed in his body and tormented by the deuill: but that by this rodde the Apostles could smite conscience, it can not be prooued.</p>
            <p>Arg. 8. 1. Tim. 3. Paul made a law that none hauing two wiues should be ordained a Bishop: now this law is positiue and Ecclesiasticall and bindes conscience. <hi>Answ.</hi> Paul is not the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of this law, but God himselfe, who ordained
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:10898:28"/>
that in mariage not three but two alone should be one flesh: and that they which serue at the altar of the Lord, should be holy. And to graunt that this law were a new law beside the written word of God, yet doeth it not follow that Paul was the maker of it: because he used not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer any doctrine to the Churches but that which he receiued of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Argum. 9. Luc. 10. <hi>He which heareth you, heareth me. Answ.</hi> These wordes properly concerne the Apostles, and doe not in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner belong to pastors &amp; teachers of the Church. And the end of these wordes is not to confirme any Apostolicall authority in making lawes to the conscience; but to signifie the priviledge which hee had vouchsafed them aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that he would so farre forth assist them with his spirite, that they should not erre or be deceiued in teaching &amp; publishing the doctrine of saluation, though otherwise they were sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men: according to Matth. 10. <hi>It is not you that speake, but the spirite of my father which speaketh in you.</hi> And the promise to be led into all truth was directed vnto them.</p>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:10898:29"/>
but that which he receiued from Christ; the precepts here ment are nothing else but rules of decencie &amp; comely order in the congregation: and though they were to be obeyed, yet Pauls meaning was not to binde any mans conscience therewith. For of greater matters he saith, <hi>This I speake for your commoditie, and not to intangle you in a snare,</hi> 1. Cor. 7. 35.</p>
            <p>Arg. 11. Councels of ancient fathers when they comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d or forbid any thing, do it with threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a curse to the offenders. <hi>Ans.</hi> The church in former time used to annexe vnto hir Canons the curse <hi>anathema,</hi> because things decreed by them were indeed, or at the least thought to be the will and word of God: and they had respect to the saying of Paul, If any teach otherwise though he be an angell from heauen, let him be accursed. Therfore councels in this action were no more but instruments of God to accurse those, whome he first of all had accursed.</p>
            <p>Arg. 12. An act indifferent if it be commanded is made necessary: &amp; the keeping of it is the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of vertue, therefore euery law bindes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to a sinne. <hi>Ans.</hi> An act in it selfe indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent being comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by mans law is not made simply necessary, for that is as much as gods law doth or can doe, but only in some part, that is, so far forth as the said act or action tends to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:10898:29"/>
and preserue the good end for which the law is made. And though the action be in this regard necessary, yet doth it still remaine indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent as it is considered in it selfe out of the ende of the law: so as if peace, the common good &amp; comely order may be maintained &amp; all offence auoided by any other meanes, the act may be done or not done without sinne before God. For whereas God himselfe hath giuen liberty &amp; freedome in the use of things indifferent, the law of man doeth not take away the same but onely moderate and order it for the common good.</p>
            <p>Arg. 13. The fast of Lent stands by a lawe and commandement of men: and this lawe bindes conscience simply: for the ancient fathers haue called it a Tradition Apostolicall, and make the keeping of it to be necassary, and the not kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of it a sinne, and punish the offenders with excommunication. <hi>Answer.</hi> It is plaine to him that will not be obstinate, that Lent fast was not commaunded in the Primitiue Church, but was freely kept at mens pleasures, &amp; in seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Churches diuersly both in regard of space of time, as also in respect of diversity of meats.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:10898:30"/>
to prepare men before-hand to a worthy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the Eucharist. And in regarde of this good ende was the offence. And whereas it is said, that auncient fathers taught a necessitie of keeping this fast, euen Hierome whome they alledge to this purpose saith the contrary. For confuting the errour of Montanus who had his set times of fast to be kept of necessity, hee <note place="margin">

            <p>By these arguments which I haue now answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, &amp; by many other being but lightly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>Arg. 1. He that makes a law binding conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to mortal sinne, hath power, if not to saue yet to destroy: because by sin, which follows upon the transgressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his law, comes death &amp; da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation: But God is the only lawgiuer that hath this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge, which is, after he hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his law, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the breaking or keeping thereof, to save or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy. Iam 4. 12. <hi>There is one lawgiuer that can saue or destroy.</hi> Therfore God alone makes laws

               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inding co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science properly, &amp; no creature ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do the like. Answer is made that S. Iames speaks of the principall law-giuer, that by his own proper authority makes lawes, &amp; doth in such manner saue &amp; destroy, that he need not feare to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroied of any: &amp; that he speaks not of secondary lawgiuers that are deputies of god &amp; make laws in his name. I say again that this answer sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds not with the text. For S. Iames speakes simply with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out distinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, limitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; the effect of his reason is this. No ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at all must slander his brother, because no man must be iudge of the law: &amp; no man can be iudge of the law, because no man can be a law-giuer to saue and destroy. Now then where be those persons that shall make lawes to the soules of men, &amp; binde them unto punishment of mortall sinne; considering God alone is the sauing &amp; destroying lawgiuer.</p>

for our gouernours by law to commaund mens thoughts and affections, then also might they command co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science: but the first is not possible, for their lawes can reach no further then to the outward man, that is, to bodie and goods, with the speaches and deedes thereof: and the ende of them all is not to maintaine spirituall peace of conscience, which is betweene man and God, but onely that externall and ciuill peace which is betweene man and man.

            <p>Touching the meanes, I set downe this rule. <hi>Whole some lawes of men, made of things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, binde conscience by vertue of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall commaundement of God, vvhich ordaineth the Magistrates authoritie: so as vvho soever shall wittingly &amp; willingly, with a disloyal mind, either breake or omit such lavves, it guiltie of s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

            <p>Now such kinde of lawes haue no vertue or power in themselues to constraine conscience, but they bind onely by vertue of an higher com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. <hi>Let euery soule <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Pet. 2. 13. that is, <hi>for conscience of God,</hi> as he saith afterward, v. 19. wherby he signifieth two thing: first that God hath ordained the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of gouernours: secondly that he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in his word, and thereby bound men in conscience to obay their gouernours law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full commandements.</p>
            <p>If the case fall out otherwise, as commonly it doth, that humane laws be not inacted of things indifferent, but of things that be good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, that is, commanded by God, then are they not <hi>

                  </gap>
               </hi> properly but <hi>divine</hi> lawes. Mens laws intreating of things that are <hi>morally good,</hi> and the parts of <hi>Gods vvorshippe,</hi> are the same with Gods laws: and therfore binde conscience, not because they were inacted by men, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:10898:35"/>
they were first made by God: men beeing no more but instruments and ministers in his name to revive, renew, and to put in exequution such precepts and laws as prescribe the worship of God, standing in the practise of true religion &amp; vertue. Of this kind are all positiue lawes tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching articles of faith, &amp; the duties of the morall law. And the man that breakes such lawes sinnes two waies, first because he breaks that which is in conscience a law of God, secondly because in disobaying his lawfull magistrate, he disob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> the generall commandement of God touching magistracie.</p>
            <p>But if it shall fall out that mens lawes be made of things that are cuill and forbidden by God, then is there no bonde of conscience at all but contrariwise, men are bound in conscience not to obay, Act. 4. 19. And hereupon the three children are commended for not obaying Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar, when he gaue a particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement vnto them to fall downe and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the golden image, Dan. 3.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, in that mans law binds onely by power of Gods law, hence it follows, that Gods law alone hath this priuiledge, that the breach of it should be a sinne. S. Iohn saith 1. epist. 3. <hi>Sinne it the anomie, or, transgressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the law,</hi> vnderstanding Gods lawe. When Dauid by
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:10898:36"/>
adulterie and murder had offended many men, &amp; that many waies, he saith Psal. 51. <hi>against thee, against thee haue I sinned.</hi> And Augustine defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned sinne to be some thing said, done, or desired against the law of God. Some man may say, if this be so, belike then we may breake mens laws without sinne. I answer, that men in breaking humane lawes, both may and doe sinne; but yet not simply, because they breake them, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in breaking them, they doe also breake the law of God. The breach of a law must be considered two waies. First as it is a trespasse, hinderance, iniurie, damage, and in this respect it is committed against mens lawes: secondly the breach of a law must be considered as it is sinne, and so it is onely against Gods law.</p>
            <p>The second point, namely How farreforth mens lawes binde conscience, I explane on this manner. It is all that the lawes of God doe or can doe, to binde conscience simply and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely. Therefore humane laws bind not simply, but so farre forth as they are agreeable to Gods word, serue for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mongood, sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d withgood order, and hinder not the libertie of conscience. The necessitie of the law ariseth of the necessitie of the good end thereof. And as the end is good and profitable more or lesse, so is the law it selfe necessarie more or lesse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:10898:36"/>
Hence it followeth that a man may doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing <hi>beside humane lawes</hi> and constitutions without breach of conscience. For if he shall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the doing of any law I. without hindrance of the ende and particular considerations, for which the law was made: II. without offence giuing as much as in him lieth: III. without contempt of him that made the law, he is not to be accused of sinne. Example. In time of warre, the magistrate of a citie commands that no man shall open the gates: the end is, that the citie and euery member thereof may be in safetie. Now it falls out that certaine citizens beeing vpon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion without the citie, are pursued by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie and in daunger of their lifes. Herupon some man within openeth the gate to res<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e them. The question is, whether he haue sinned or no. And the truth is, he hath not: because he did not hinder the ende of the law, but rather further it, and that without scandal to men, or contempt to the magistrate.</p>
            <p>And this stands euen by the equitie of Gods word. God made a law, that the priests onely should eate of the shewbread: now Dauid being no priest, did vpon vrgent occasion eate of it without sinne. If this be true in Gods law, then it may also be true in the lawes of men, that they may in some cases be omitted without

sinne, against God.</p>

Now he is in conscience to stand to his bargaine, because the thing is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, &amp; the domage is priuate, &amp; great reuerence must be had of the name of God which hath bin used in the bargaine making.

If at the first it were lawfull, and afterwarde by some meanes become either impossible or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, it binds not conscience. For when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes impossible, then wee may safely thinke that God from heauen frees a man from his oath. And when it beginnes to be unlawfull, then it ceaseth to bind, because the binding ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is onely from the worde of God. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: a king bindes himselfe by oath to a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Christian prince to find him men &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to defende his people against all enemies. This oath is lawfull. Well, afterward the prince becomes a professed enemy to him, his religion, &amp; people: and then the kings oth becomes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful and binds him not: because the word for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids that there should be any league of amitie with Gods enemies: though there may be leagues of concord with them.</p>
            <p>Seeing a lawfull oath must bind conscience, though a man be deceiued and great losses fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, it shews in how great reuerence we should haue Gods name, and with what care and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:10898:43"/>
take an oth. And by this we must be aduertiseo to take heed of customable swearing in our common talke, whether our oathes be great or small. We must thinke of an oth as a part of Gods worship: nay the H. ghost often puts it for the whole worship of God. Isai. 19. 18. <hi>In that day shall five cities in the lande of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt speake the language of Canaan, and shall sweare by the Lorde of hostes,</hi> that is, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and worship him. Ierem. 12. 16. <hi>If they will learne the waies of my people, to sweare by my Name, The Lorde liveth, then shall they be built in the middest of my people.</hi> This serues to shew unto us, that such as giue them-selues to swearing, want religion &amp; good conscience: &amp; that those families in which there is risenesse of othes, abandon all care of religion, and banish God out of their houses. And indeed it is a very hard thing for the common swearer to auoide common periury. If we see a man holde up his hand at the barre of an earthly iudge we pity him and are sorry for him: on then why doe we not pittie blasphemers and common swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. For with God they are no better then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beis, that hold up their hands at the barre of his iudgement seate as guilty malefactours. Exod. 20. 7. Augustine saith well, <hi>They that worship stockes and stones feare to svveare falsely by
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:10898:43"/>
stones, and doest not then feare God that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, God that liveth, God that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>Thus much of an Oath: now followes a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise which is either to God or man: the first is called a vow, the second a single promise.</p>
            <p>A vowe is taken three waies. First general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">§ 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Of a vow bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> for a promise of morall obedience: and this vowe is first made in Baptisme and continued in the Lordes Supper, as also in the spirituall exercises of invocation and repentance. It is called of Peter 1. Epist. 3. 21. the <hi>stipulation which a good conscience makes to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This kinde of vowe bindes all and euery member of the Church of God. And the not keeping of it is the common sinne of the worlde: for most men make not conscience to perfourme that which they haue promised to God in Baptisme: and therefore their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme is become unto them <hi>the sacrifice of fooles.</hi> Ecclesiast. 4. 17. But considering we are bound in conscience by this vowe, let vs here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after endeauor to be as good as our word; and that shall be when we begin to die to our sinnes
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:10898:44"/>
and rise to newnesse of life: we will seeme to haue care to keepe touch with men: what a shame is it for us then not to keepe couenant with God.</p>
            <p>Againe a vow is taken for a promise of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall obedience, whereof reade Num. 6. and 30. and Levit. 27. This vow is peculiar to the old Testament and did not bind all men, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such as had peculiar occasion to vowe, and thereupon bound themselues: as the Nazarites, and some other.</p>
            <p>Thirdly a vow is taken for the performance of some outwarde and bodily exercises taken up of a mans owne accord, as being things in a mans owne liberty, without any commaundè<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God: as the keeping of set times of fast, of praying or reading, the performance of set taskes, almes giuing, abstinence from certaine meates and drinkes, in the use whereof through our owne weakenesse we feare any occasion of sinne. And this kind of vow is more peculiar to the new Testament.</p>
            <p>In the making of it that it may be warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, foure things must be obserued. I. It must be agreeable to the worde of God. II. It must not be against a mans generall or particular cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. III. It must be in a mans power, and not against Christian liberty. IIII. It must be so
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:10898:44"/>
made and be obserued without any opinion of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>rit or worship of God to this end alone, that it may be a means to exercise and cherish repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and inuocation, temperance, patience, and to shewe forth thankfulnesse to God.</p>
            <p>A vowe thus made, binds conscience by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Gods commandement. Eccles. 5. 3. <hi>When thou hast <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>Conscience giues iudgement of things to come, by foretelling and as it were saying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in the heart, that the thing may be well done or ill done. Of this kinde of iudgement e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man may haue experience in him selfe,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:10898:49"/>
when he is about to enterprise any busines ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good or badde.</p>
            <p>By this we may see the goodnes of God to all men. If a man beeing to make an vnknowne iourney, should finde one that would goe with him and shew him the way, with al the turnings thereof, he could not but take it for a great point of curtosie. Wee are pilgrimes in this world, our life is our iourney. God also hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed our conscience to be our companion and guide, to shew vs what course we may take and what we may not.</p>
            <p>And here it must be noted, that in all things to be done, conscience is of great force &amp; beares a great stroke. For, <hi>This is the beginning of a good vvorke, that the conscience first of all give her iudgement truely, that the thing may be done, and is acceptable to God.</hi> Rom. 14. 23. <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is not of faith,</hi> that is, whatsoeuer is not done of a settled perswasion in iudgement and conscience out of Gods word, howsoeuer men iudge of it, <hi>is sinne.</hi> Againe, God regardes not the outward pompe of the action or the doer, but obedience and especially the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the heart: therefore vnlesse the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science first of all approoue the thing to be good and agreeable to Gods will, it can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but a sinne. And he that shall doe a
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:10898:49"/>
thing, because it is good in his owne eyes, not knowing that God doeth allow of it, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres him-selfe before God, and disobaies him as the seruant that in his masters house will not doe his masters will but his owne will.</p>
            <p>From this former rule arise three other: the first, <hi>What soeuer is done vvith a doubting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

            <p>Thus it is manifest that consci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nce beares a great stroke in all things that are to be saide or done. And hereby we are aduertised of many things. First, if a thing done without good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science be a sinne, then much more that which is done without direction of Gods word is a flatte sinne: for without direction of Gods word conscience can giue no good dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And if God will holde that for a sinne which is done without direction of his word,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:10898:50"/>
then no doubt Gods word ministers sufficient direction for all actions whatsoeuer: so as if a man be to put but a bit of bread in his mouth, it can so farre forth direct him, that in doi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g of it he shall be able to please God: If this were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot true, mans ease were most miserable. For then we should sinne in manifold actions, and that without remedie. And here by the Word, I meane nothing but the Scriptures of the olde and new Testament, which containe in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues sufficient direction for all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ctions As for the law of nature, though it af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oard in deede some direction; yet is it corrupt, imperfect, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certen: and whatsoeuer is right and good therin is contained in the writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> word of God. And as for the best vnwritte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> traditions, let al the Papists in the world answer if they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, how I may in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science be perswaded that they are the word of God. If they say that the auncient fathers of the primitive Church auouch in their writings that they are Apostolicall traditions, I answer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> I know and be certen in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science that the fathers subiect to errour, in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so haue not erred.</p>
            <p>Againe we learne hence, that a good intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not sufficient to make a good worke, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse withall conscience can giue iudgement that God doth approoue the action. This shewes

For they doe these actions either of custome, or example, or necessitie, as beasts doe, and not of faith: because they know not Gods will touching things to be done or left vndone.

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red indeede by Christ, but is continued partly by Christ, and partly by the man himselfe.</p>
            <p>Christian libertie hath three parts.</p>
            <p>The first, is a freedome from the iustification of the morall lawe. For he that is a member of Christ, is not bound in conscience to bring the perfect righteousnes of the law in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for his iustification before God, Gal. 5. 1. with v. 3.</p>
            <p>Hence it followeth, that he that is a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, is likewise freed from the curse and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the law, Rom. 8. 1. <hi>There is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to them that are in Christ.</hi> Gal. 3. 13. <hi>Christ hath redeemed vs from the curse of the law, when he was made a curse for vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this first part of Christian libertie, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares that there cannot be any iustification of a sinner by workes of grace before God. For he that will be iustified but by one worke, <hi>is debter to the vvhole lavv,</hi> Gal. 3. 3. but no man that is a member of Christ is debter to the whole law; for his libertie is to be free in that
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:10898:53"/>
point: therefore no man is iustified so much as by one worke.</p>
            <p>The second part, is freedome from the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of the law, which exacteth perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and condemneth all imperfection, Rom. 6. 14. <hi>Sinne hath no more dominion ouer yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>: for ye are not vnder the law but vnder grace.</hi> 1. Ioh. 5. 3. <hi>This is the loue of God, that ye keepe his commandements: and his commandements are not grieuous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence it followeth that God will accept of our imperfect obedience, if it be sincere: yea he accepts the will, desire, and indeauour to obay for obedience it selfe. Malach. 3. 17. <hi>And I vvill spare them as a man spareth his owne sonne that serueth him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third part is, that the conscience is freed from the bond of the ceremoniall law, Gal. 3. 25. <hi>But after that faith is come, we are no more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a schoolemaster.</hi> Eph. 2. 15. <hi>And hath broken the stoppe of the partition wall, in abrogating through his flesh, the lavv of commaundements vvhich standeth in ordinances.</hi> Coloss. 2. 14. <hi>And hath put out the hand vvriting of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances vvhich vvas against vs.</hi> v. 16. <hi>Let no man therefore condemne you in meate and drinke, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moone, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:10898:54"/>
Hence it followeth, that all Christians may freely without scruple of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science, vse all things indifferent, so be it the manner of vsing them be good.</p>
            <p>And first, when I say that all may vse them, I vnderstand a two-fold vses naturall, or spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall.</p>
            <p>The naturall vse, is either to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eleeue our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities, or for honest delite. Thus the Psalmist saith, that God giues not onely bread to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the heart of man, but also wine to make glad the heart, &amp; oyle to make the face to shine, Psal. 104. 15. and God hath put into his creatures infinite varieties of colours, sauours, tastes, and formes to this end that men might take delite in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Hence it follows, that <hi>Recreation</hi> is lawfull, and a part of Christian libertie, if it be well vsed. By <hi>recreation</hi> I vnderstand exercises and sports, seruing to refresh either the bodie or the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and that they may be well vsed, two rules esp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>

                  </gap>full recreation</hi> stands only in the vse of things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. For if the things be commanded by God, there is no sporting in them; or if they, be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, there is no vsing of them at all. Vpon this ground, sundrie kindes of recreation are to be neglected. As I. the dauncing commonly vsed in these daies, in which men and women,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:10898:54"/>
yongmen and ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

This exercise cannot be numbred among things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different; for experience sheweth, that it hath beene vsually either a fruit or a follower of great wickednes, as idolatric, fornication, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes: hereupon, one well compared it to a <note n="*" place="margin">Tripadium est circulus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Againe, if we must giue an account of euery idle worde, then also of euery idle gesture and pace: &amp; what account can be giuen of these paces backward and forward, of caprings, iumpes, gambols, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, with many other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>riskes of lightnes and vanitie, more beseeming goates and apes, of whome they are commonly vsed, then men. Whereas Salomon esteemed laughter as mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, he would (no doubt) haue condemned our common lascivious dauncing much more for madnesse, laughter beeing but the least part of it. II. Dicing, which is precisely the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of a lotte, not to be vsed at our pleasures, but in matters of weight and importance. And of this kinde are all games, the ground where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are not the sleight of mans witte, but lotte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. III. Playes and enterludes, that stande in the representation of the vices and misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:10898:55"/>
of the world. For if it be not lawfull to name vices, vnles it be in the way of dislike, Eph. 5. 3. much lesse is it warrantable to gesture and represent vice in the way of recreation and delite. The second rule is, that recreation must be a sparing, moderate, and lawfull vse of things <note place="margin">pag 103. and 104.</note> indifferent, according to the rules following:</p>
            <p>The spirituall vse is, when we take occasion by the creatures to meditate and speake of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly things: as, vpon the sight of the vine and the branches thereof, to consider the mysticall coniunction betweene Christ and his Church: by the sight of the rainbow to think of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of God of not drowning the world by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: and by any thing that befalls, to take occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to consider in it the wisdome, goodnes, iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, mercie, providence of God, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I adde further, that things indifferent; as bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, outward libertie, riches, pouertie, single estate, marriage, meate, drinke, apparrell, buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, may be vsed <hi>freely,</hi> because they are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commanded by God nor forbidden: and in themselues considered, they may be vsed or not vsed without breach of conscience.</p>
            <p>The right manner of vsing them, is to sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them by the word and praier, 1. Tim. 4. 3, 4. and not onely some of them, but the vse of them all. Meate, drinke, and marriage are thus to be
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:10898:55"/>
sanctified as the place before noted declareth. Paul sanctified his iourney on this manner, Act. 21. 5. And the Iewes were commanded to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their houses at the first entrance, Deut. 20. 5. By this dedication we may well vnderstand not onely the letting of the house, or the prouiding of a tenant, but also the sanctifying of it by invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Gods name, that by his blessing the place with the roomes thereof might serue for their benefit and comfort. And on this maner to blesse our dwelling places when we first enter into them, is the best way that can be to preserue them from the casualties of fire within, and lightning from heauen, and from the annoiance and molestation of euill spirits, and other iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God.</p>
            <p>Things indifferent are sanctified by Gods word, because it shewes what things we may vse, and what things we may not: and if we may vse them, in what manner it is to be done. And to this purpose the scriptures affoard foure rules.</p>
            <p>The first, that all things must be done to Gods glorie, 1. Cor. 10. 31. <hi>Whether ye eate or drinke or what soeuer ye doe, doe all to the glorie of God.</hi> And that this may be performed, things indifferent must be vsed as signes and tables, in which we may shew forth the graces &amp; vertues
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:10898:56"/>
that God hath wrought in the heart. For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: we must so make our apparrell both for matter and fashion, and so weare it, that it may in some sort set forth to the beholder our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie, sobrietie, frugalitie, humilitie, &amp;c. that hereby he may be occasioned to say, behold a graue, sober, modest person: and so of the rest. And the common sinne of this time is, that meat, drinke, apparrell, buildings, are vsed as banners displaied to set forth to the world mans wit, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, and pride of heart.</p>
            <p>The second We must suffer our selues law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be limited and restrained in the ouer-much or ouer-common vse of things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. I say the ouer-common vse, because it is not Gods will vtterly and absolutely to barre vs of the vse of such things. Now the restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of our vse are two, the first is the lawe of charitie. For as charitie giues place to pietie, so Christian libertie in the vse of outwarde things, giues place to charitie. And the law of charitie is, that we should not vse things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent to the hurt or offence of our brother, 1. Cor. 8. 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Question.</hi> Whether may a man vse his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie before such as are weake, and not yet perswaded of their libertie. <hi>Ansvver.</hi> Some are weake of simple ignorance, or because
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:10898:56"/>
they haue beene deceiued by the abuse of long custome: and yet are willing to be reformed. And before such wee must abstaine, least by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample we draw them to sinne by giuing occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them of doing that whereof they doubt. Againe some are weake up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> affected igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or of malice, and in the presence of such we need not abstaine. Vpon this ground Paul who circumcised Timothy would not circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise Titus.</p>
            <p>The second restrainer is the wholesome lawes of men whether ciuill or Ecclesiasticall. For howsoeuer things indifferent after the law is once made of them, remaine still indifferent in themselues: yet obedience to the law is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, and that for conscience sake. Actes 15. vers 28.</p>
            <p>The third: we must use things indifferent so farre foorth as they shall further us in godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. For we ought to doe all things not only to the edification of others, but also of our own selues. And therefore it is a flat abuse of christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an liberty, for men so to pamper their bodies with meate and drinke, that thereby they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able themselues to heare Gods word, to pray, to giue good counsell, to doe the ordinary works of their callings.</p>
            <p>The fourth: things indifferent must be used
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:10898:57"/>
within the compasse of our callings, that is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our ability, degree, state and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life. And it is a common abuse of this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in our dayes, that the meane man will be in meate, drinke, apparell, building, as the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemans the gentleman as the knight; the knight as the lord or Earle.</p>
            <p>Now then things indifferent are sanctified to vs by the worde, when our consciences are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued out of the word that we may use them, so it be in the manner before named, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rules here set downe.</p>
            <p>They are sanctified by prayer, when wee craue at Gods handes the right use of them, and hauing obtained the same, giue him thanks therefore. Coloss. 3. v. 17. <hi>Whatsoever yee doe in worde or deede, doe all in the name of our Lorde Iesus, giving thankes to God the father by him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much of Christian liberty, by which wee are admonished of sundry duties. I. to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to become good members of Christ of what estate or condition soeuer we be. The liberties of the citie of Rome made not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Romanes borne but euen the men of other countreyes seeke to be citizens thereof. Act. 22. 28. The priuiledges of the Iewes in Persia made many become Iewes, Hest. 8. 17. O then, much
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:10898:57"/>
more should the spirituall liberty of conscience purchased by the blood of Christ, mooue us to seeke for the kingdome of heauen, and that we might become good members thereof. II. Againe by this we are taught to study, learne, and loue the scriptures, in which our liberties are recorded. Wee make account of our char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters wherby we holde our earthly liberties, yea wee gladly reade them and acquaint our selues with them: what a shame then will it be for vs to make no more account of the word of God that is the law of spirituall liberty. Iam. 2. v. 16. III. Lastly we are aduertised most heartily to obey and serue God according to his worde, for that is the ende of our liberty: the seruant doeth all his businesse more chearefully in the hope and expectation he hath of liberty. Againe our liberty most of all appeares in our seruice and obedience, because the seruice of God is perfect freedome; as on the contrary in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience of Gods commandements standes our spirituall bondage.</p>
            <p>The second property of conscience is an vnfal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible certenty of the pardon of sinne &amp; life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting. <note place="margin">§ 2. Of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentie of saluation.</note> That this point may be cleared, I will handle the question betweene vs and Papistes touching the certenty of saluation. And that I may proceede in order we must distinguish the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:10898:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
kindes of certenty. First of all, Certenty is either Vnfallible or Conjecturall. Vnfallible, wherein a man is neuer disappointed. Conjecturall, which is not so euident, because it is grounded onely upon likelihoodes. The first all Papiste<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, but the second they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in the matter of saluation. Againe certenty is either of faith, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> experimentall, which Papistes call <hi>

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rall.</hi> Certenty of faith is, whereby any thing is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenly beleeued; and it is either generall or speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. Generall certenty, is to beleeue assuredly that the word of God is trueth it selfe, and this both wee and papistes allow. Speciall certenty is by faith to apply the promise of saluation to our selues, and to beleeue without doubt that remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinnes by Christ and life euerlasting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs unto us. This kind of certenty we holde and maintaine, and Papists with one consent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it, acknowledging no assurance but by hope; <hi>Morall</hi> certenty is that which proceedes from sanctification and good workes, as signes and tokens of true faith. This wee both allowe, yet with some difference. For they esteeme all cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenty that comes by workes to be uncerten and often to deceiue: but wee doe otherwise if the workes be done in uprightnesse of heart.</p>
            <p>The question then is, whether a man in this life may ordinarily without reuelation be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly

            <p>Touching the second part of my reason, that faith is a particular perswasion applying things beleeued: I prooue it thus. The propertie of faith is to receiue the promise, Galat. 3. 14. and the thing promised which is Christ with his spirit, Ioh. 1. 12. Now Christ is receiued by a particular application, as will appeare if we doe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>t marke the end and use of the ministery of the word and of the sacraments. For when God giues any blessing to man, it is to be receiued by man as God giueth it. Now God giues Christ or at the least offereth him not generally to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:10898:60"/>
mankinde, but to the seuerall and particular members of the Church. In the Lords supper, as in euery sacrament, there is a relation or ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie betwene the outward signes &amp; the things signified. The action of the minister giuing the bread and the wine representeth Gods action in giuing Christ with his benefits to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular communicants: againe the action of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the bread and wine seuerally, represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth another spirituall action of the beleeuing heart which applyeth Christ unto it selfe for the pardon of sinne and life euerlasting. Papists yeeld not to this yet if they refuse to maintaine this analogie, they ouerturne the sacrament and dissent from antiquity. Augustine saith, <hi>The body</hi>

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> certen assurance of it in this life. If we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the words thus, then the argument of the holy Ghost must be framed on this manner. If loue or hatred were to be knowne, then it must be knowne by the outward blessings of God: but it cannot be knowne by the outward bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of God, for all things come alike to all: therefore loue and hatred cannot be knowne. The propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is false. For loue may be known other waies then by outward benefits; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reason is not meete to be ascribed to the spirit of truth. Wherefore the true and proper sense of the words is, that loue or hatred cannot be iudged or discerned by outward blessings of God. S.

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:10898:65"/>
our spirit, that we are the sonnes of God; and this perswasion is caused by his calling and iustifying vs freely by faith.</hi> And S. Hierome (though co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly <note place="margin">Hierome on this place.</note> abused to the contrarie) saith no more but that men cannot know loue or hatred by the present afflictions which they suffer, because they know not whether they suffer them for triall or for punishment.</p>
            <p>Obiect. 3. 1. Cor. 4. <hi>I iudge not my selfe, I know nothing by my selfe.</hi> Here Paul as not being pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vic to his own estate, refuseth to giue any iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his owne righteousnes. <hi>Answ.</hi> It is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest by the words of this epistle, that certaine in Corinth, boldly more then wisely, censured the Apostles ministerie, and withall disgraced it in respect of the ministery of other teachers. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Paul in this chapter goes about to make an Apologie for himselfe, speaking nothing of his owne person and the estate thereof before God, but onely of his ministerie and the excellencie thereof. And this is the iudgement of Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, Aquinas, and Lira vpon this text. And when he saith, <hi>I iudge not my selfe,</hi> his meaning is, I take not vpon me to iudge of what value and price my ministerie is before God, in respect of the ministerie of this or that man: but I leaue all to God. Here then Paul refuseth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to giue iudgement of the excellencie of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:10898:66"/>
his owne ministerie, and in other cases he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed not to iudge him selfe, as when he said, <hi>I haue fought a good fight, I haue kept the faith, hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth is laid vp for me the crowne of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes which the Lord the righteous iudge shall giue me,</hi>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. Tim. 4. 8. And Chrysostome on this place saith, that Paul refused to iudge himselfe not simply, but onely for this ende, that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine others and teach them modestie. And where Paul saith, <hi>I know nothing by my selfe,</hi> the speach is not generall, but must be vnderstoode of negligences and offences in the compasse of his ministery. For he was priuie to himselfe that in simplicitie and godly purenes, he had his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation in the world, 2. Cor. 1. 12. and he knew this by himselfe, that nothing should seuer him from the loue of God in Christ. Rom. 8. 38.</p>
            <p>Obiect. 4. That we may be iustified there is somewhat required of vs, namely faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: and where these are wanting a man cannot be iustified. Now no man can be certen by the certentie of faith, that he repents of his sinnes with all his heart, and that he hath such a faith, as God requires at our hands, considering there is no testimonie in the word of our faith and repentance in particular. Therefore no man can be certen by certentie of faith, that his sinnes are pardoned. <hi>Answer.</hi> It is not necessarie that
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:10898:66"/>
any man should be certen by faith of his faith and repentance; because faith is onely of such things as are absent, where faith and repentance are truly present in all that truly beleeue and rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:10898:68"/>
of Christian faith, and therefore they must in sense containe more then the deuill doth or can beleeue: nowe the deuill beleeueth thus much, that God giues remissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of sinnes to his Church: Christian men therefore must goe one steppe further, and beleeue particularly the remission of their owne sinnes. Otherwise if the Papists will haue the Catholicke faith to beleeue no more in this point, then the damned spirits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, let them take it to themselues. But they replie further, that if there were any such ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of faith, then some persons must beleeue, that they are iust though they willingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit mortall sinne, which is an euident falshood. <hi>Ansvver.</hi> He that beleeues the pardon of his owne sinnes by true faith, hath the spirit of God in him, and a constant purpose not to sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God: and therefore if he sinne, it is against his purpose, and without any full consent of wil; and it is not he that doeth it, but the sinne that dwelleth in him. But if it so fall our, that the child of God be ouertaken with any actual sinne, then his case standeth thus. He hath by his fall woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his conscience, weakned his faith, bereaued himselfe of Gods fauour as much as in him lieth, made himselfe guiltie of a sinne and worthie of damnation: and God for his part according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turnes the woonted signes of his sauour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:10898:69"/>
signes of anger and displeasure: and the sinne though it be pardoned in the purpose of God, yet is it not actually pardoned, till the partie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. Things standing thus, we teach not that men must beleeue the pardon of their sinnes while they liue and lie in them; for that were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>tly to teach falshoode for truth: but our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is, that such persons must first of all humble themselues, and say with the prodigall childe, that they haue sinned against God, and are not worthie to be called his children any more: and againe renew their decaied faith and repentance, that they may beleeue (as before) their perfect reconciliation with God.</p>
            <p>Obiect. 8. In respect of God, who is truth it selfe, we are to beleeue the promise in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: yet if we respect our owne vnworthines and indisposition, we are to feare and in some part to doubt. For the promise of remission of sinnes is not absolute, but depends vpon the condition of our workes. Therefore our certentie is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly coniecturall. <hi>Answer.</hi> I answer first that in respect of our owne vnworthines, we are not to doubt of our saluation, but to be out of all doubt, yea to dispaire before the iudgement seate of God. For they which are of the workes of the lawe, are vnder <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he curse, Gal. 3. 10. and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:10898:69"/>
Paul saith of his owne workes of grace, <hi>in this am I not iustified,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 4. And Dauid being out of all doubt of his owne deserued damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in regard of his owne vnworthines saith freely, <hi>Enter not into indgement with thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, O Lord, for no flesh shallbe i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For true faith makes an entrance vnto God <hi>vvith bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> (I say with boldnes) euen for those persons that are vnworthy in themselues, Eph. 4. 12. And Abraham (whose faith is to be followed of vs) did not vpon the consideration of his olde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caied bodie, rest himselfe with bare hope vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alikelihood of the accomplishment of Gods promise, but he <hi>beleeued vnder hope euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst hope,</hi> Rom. 4. 18. Lastly I answear that the ground of the former obiection is erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, namely that the promise of saluation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the condition of our workes: because the Scripture saith, it is made and accomplished on mans part freely. I graunt indeede that to the promise there is annexed a condition of faith: yet faith here must not be considered as a worke, but as an instrument apprehending Christ with his benefits: and withall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>epentance with the fruits thereof are on our part required,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:10898:70"/>
yet no otherwise but as they are necessaric con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents of faith, and the signes and documents thereof.</p>
            <p>Obiect. 9. No man knowes all his sinnes: no man therefore can certenly know that all his sinnes are pardoned, and that he is accepted of God. <hi>Ansvver.</hi> The ground of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is false: namely that a man cannot be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the pardon of his sinnes, if some of them be vnknowne. And to make this manifest, I will lay downe a more certen ground, which shal be this. As the case is in Repentance, so it is also in faith: but there may be true and sufficient repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of vnknowne sinnes. God indeede requires a particular repentance for particular knowne sinnes; but if they be hidden and vnknowne, he accepts a generall repentance: an example wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we haue in Dauid, <hi>who knows,</hi> saith se, <hi>the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of this life? then purge me from my secret s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>es.</hi> If this were not so, neither Dauid nor any man els could be saued. For when Dauid repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted greatly of his murder and adulterie, yet we find not that he repented particularly of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygamie: which, in all likelihoode, through the swinge and custome of those times was not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reputed to be any sinne; specially in the person of a king: and yet because (as we know) he is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, this very sinne is pardoned. Therefore
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:10898:70"/>
when God pardons the knowne sinnes of men, whereof they repent, he doth withall pardon the rest that are vnknowne. And by this it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares that the ignorance of some hidden sinnes, after a man with diligence hath searched him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, cannot preiudice an vnfallible assurance of the pardon of them all and of his owne salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Obiect. 10. We pray for the pardon of our owne sinnes, and therefore we are vncerten of pardon: the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which knows that he hath par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, need not pray for it. I <hi>answer</hi> first, when we are taught by Christ to pray for the forgiuenes of our debts, we are put in mind not to seek the pardon of al our sinnes, whether past or present but specially of our present and daily offences whereby we make our selues day by day guilty, till such time as we humble our selues and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of them. Secondly by this petition we are taught to aske the increase of our assurance; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause though God bestow endles mercie on vs, yet we are s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Obiect. 11. No man can beleeue his owne saluation, as he beleeues the articles of faith: therefore no man can beleeue the pardon of

               </gap>ie. I <hi>answer,</hi> first that euery one that lookes for saluation by Christ, is bound in conscience as certenly to beleeue his owne saluation and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption by Christ, as he beleeues the articles of faith; because to the promise of life there is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed a commandement to beleeue and applie it. Secondly, this faith whereby we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue our owne saluation, if we respect the true and proper nature thereof, is as certen as that faith whereby we beleeue the articles of faith. Thirdly, as there be diuers ages in the life of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, so there be diuers degrees and measures of true faith. There is first of all a beginning or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of faith, like the <hi>smoking flaxe</hi> and <hi>br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> bruise. Againe there is <hi>weake faith,</hi> which belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the promise truly, but yet is perplexed with many doubtings. Lastly, there is <hi>strong faith,</hi> which hath ouercome all doubtings, and is not onely for nature certen, but also a large &amp; plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully perswasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Gods mercy in Christ.

Some places de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie unto man that certentie which is proper to God, which is, to discerne in himselfe all things to come plainly, as they shal come to passe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out helpe of testimonies and outward signes.

            </p>
            <p>Thus I haue in some part made manifest that an unfallible certenty of pardon of sinne and life euerlasting is the property of euery renued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. Now therefore I will proceede further to consider how this certenty is caused and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:10898:73"/>
in the conscience. The principall agent and beginner thereof is the Holy ghost, in light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the minde and conscience with spirituall and diuine light: and the instrument in this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is the ministery of the gospell wherby the worde of life is applyed in the name of God to the person of euery hearer. And this certentie is by little and little conceiued in a forme of reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or practicall syllogisme framed in the mind by the holy ghost on this manner.
<q>
                  <l>Euery one that beleeues, is the child of God.</l>
                  <l>But I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e beleeve,</l>
                  <l>Therefore I am the child of God.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The proposition is made by the minister of the worde in the publike congregation: and it is nothing else but the promise of eternall life applyed to the particular hearer. The second part or the assumption is the voice of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence regenerate or the voice of Gods spirite in the same. Now Papistes write and auouch that the assumption is false: but the reasons which they use to prooue the same, are of small moment. First they alledge, that many are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in their perswasions, thinking they haue that which they haue not: I answere againe that many doe falsely presume of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and imagine they haue that faith which they haue not: and in all such the assumption
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:10898:74"/>
is false: yet in all them that are chosen to saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and truely called, it is vnfallibly true. For such as haue receiued the gift of true faith, haue also another gift of discerning whereby they see and know their owne faith. It is further obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted that Ieremy saieth, 17. 9. <hi>The heart is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull and vvicked above all things, vvho can knovve it?</hi> But the intent of this place is onely to shew, that no man can search his heart to the very bottome, to see all and euery want, infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, and wicked inclination that is therein. For originall sinne wherewith the heart of man is tainted, is a pronenesse or disposition to all the sinnes that are or may be. And though men can not discerue all their sinnes, yet many of them are certenly knowen: why may not then many of the graces of God be certenly known, specially those which be of the principall, as faith, sanctification, repentance. Againe it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that Peter beleeued that he was able to lay downe his life for Christs sake, and yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede was not as the euent declared, for when the time came he denyed Christ. <hi>Ansvv.</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at this time was but weake in faith, and hee was much carried away with a confidence of his owne strength, which made him speake these wordes of presumption: and though he failed in this one particular action, yet failed hee
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:10898:74"/>
not in the principall, that is, in the perswasion of the pardon of his owne sinnes and of life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting. In a word, it is certen that many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them-selues of Gods mercy, and yet are deceiued: neuerthelesse all such as doe truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue are not deceiued. The holy ghost making them to see that in themselues which by nature they can not discerne, as Paul signified, when he said, I speake the truth, I lie not, my conscience bearing me witnesse <hi>by the Holy Ghost,</hi> Rom. 9. v. 1.</p>
            <p>Againe the same testimony is giuen other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise thus;
<q>
                  <p>Euery childe of God hath the pardon of his sinnes, <hi>saith Gods word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I am Gods child: and therefore have the pardon of my sinnes, <hi>saith the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed conscience by the direction of Gods spirit. Rom. 8. 16. Gal.</hi> 4. 6.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>After that this testimony is once begun, it is confirmed by the same meanes, as also by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and the sacraments. Now it may be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded how a bodily element, as bread, wine, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, should be able to confirme a perswasion of our adoption that is in the conscience. <hi>Ansvv.</hi> The element in the sacrament is an outwarde seale or instrument to confirme faith not as a medicine restores and confirmes health, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p>Whereas presumption and the illusion of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan will as well tell a man that he is the childe of God, as the true testimony of regenerate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, the way to put difference betwene them is this. I. Presumption is naturall and from the very wombe, but this testimony of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is supernaturall. II. Presumption is in them that make no account of the ordinarie meanes of saluation. This testimony comes by the reuerent and carefull hearing of Gods worde. III. Presumption is in them that use not to call on the name of God: but this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of conscience is ioyned with the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of adoption which is the spirite of prayer. IV. Presumption is ioyned with loosenesse of life, this testimony brings with it alwayes an
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:10898:75"/>
happy change and alteration. For hee which hath a good conscience, hath also care to keepe good conscience in all things. V. Presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is without doubting: wheras the testimony of conscience is mingled with manifold doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. Mar. 9. 24. Luc. 17. 5. yea otherwhiles o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercharged with them. Psal. 77. 7, 8. VI. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption will giue a man the slippe in the time of sicknesse and in the houre of death, and the testimony of good conscience stickes by him to the end, and euen makes him say, <hi>Lorde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member now how I haue vvalked before thee in truth, and haue done that which is acceptable in thy sight.</hi> Isai. 38. 1.</p>

The deuill begins and disputes thus. Thou, O wretched man art a most grieuous sinner: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou art but a damned wretch. The consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence answereth and saith, I know that Christ hath made a satisfaction for my sinnes, and freed me from damnation.

Now when a man is driuen to this straight, it is neither wit, nor learning, nor fauour, nor ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that can repulse this temptation, but onely the poore conscience directed and sanctified by the spirit of God which boldly and constantly answereth, <hi>I know that I beleeve.</hi>

            <p>If any shall demaund why God doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly regenerate the conscience and cause it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to excuse, the answere is this.

               <note place="margin">Luk. 5. 8.</note> Dead conscience is that, which though it can do <note place="margin">Dead con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</note> nothing but accuse, yet commonly it lye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> quiet, accusing litle or nothing at all.</p>
            <p>The causes why conscience lyeth dead in all men, either more or lesse, are many. I. Defect of reason or understanding in crased braines. II. Violence and strength of affections, which as a
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:10898:79"/>
cloud do ouercast the mind, &amp;c as a gulfe of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter swallow up the iudgement and reason: and therby hinder the conscience from accusing: for when reason can not doe his part, then consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth nothing. For exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple: some one in his rage behaues himselfe like a mad man, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly commits any mischiefe without control<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of conscience: but when choller is down, he begins to be ashamed and troubled in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, not alwaies by grace, but euen by the force of his naturall conscience, which when affection is calmed begins to stirre, as appeareth in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Cain. III. Ignorance of Gods will &amp; errors in iudgement cause the conscience to be quiet, when it ought to accuse. This we find by experience in the deaths of obstinate hercukes, which suffer for their damnable opinions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out checke of conscience.</p>
            <p>Dead conscience hath two degrees. The first is the slumbring or the benummed conscience; the second is the feared conscience.</p>
            <p>The <hi>benummed</hi> conscience is that which doth <note place="margin">Conscience benumed.</note> not accuse a man for any sinne vnlesse it be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous or capitall &amp; not alwaies for that but only in the time of some grievous sickenesse or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity. Iosephs brethren were not much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in conscience for their villany in selling their brother, till afterwarde when they were afflicted with famine and distressed in Egypt.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:10898:80"/>
Geues. 42. 2. This is the conscience that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly raignes in the hearts of drousie prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, of all carnall and lukewarme-gospellers, and of such as are commonly tearmed ciuill ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest men, whose apparent integritie will not free them from guiltie consciences.</p>
            <p>Such a conscience is to be taken heede of as being most dangerous. It is like a wilde beast, which so long as hee lyes a sleepe seemes very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ame and gentle, and hurtes no man: but when he is rowzed, he then awakes and flies in a mans face, and offers to pull out his throate. And so it is the manner of dead conscience to lye still and quiet euen through the course of a mans life: and hereupon a man would thinke (as most do) that it were a good conscience indeed: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sicknesse or death approcheth, it beeing awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by the hande of God, beginnes to stande up on his legges, and shewes his fierce eyes and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to rende out euen the very throate of the soule. And heathen poets knowing this right well, haue compared euill conscience to Furies pursuing men with firebrands.</p>
            <p>The <hi>seared conscience</hi> is that which doeth <note place="margin">Seared con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</note> not accuse for any sinne; no not for great sinnes. It is compared by Paul, 1. Tim. 4. v. 2. to the parte of a mans body which is not onely berefe of sense, life, &amp; motion by the gangrene, but also
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:10898:80"/>
is burnt with a searing yron: and therefore must needes be vtterly past all feeling.</p>
            <p>This kind of conscience is not in al men, but in such persons as are become obstinate heretikes and notorious malefactours. And it is not in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by nature, but by an increase of the corruption of nature; and that by certaine steppes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. For naturally euery man hath in him blindnes of minde, and obstinacie or froward nes of heart; yet so, as with the blindnes and ig norance of minde, are ioyned some remnants of the light of nature, shewing vs what is good and euill. Now the heart of man beeing excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly obstinate and peruerse, carrieth him to commit sinnes euen against the light of nature and common conscience: by practise of such sinnes the light of nature is extinguished: and then commeth the <hi>reprobate mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Eph. 4. 18. Rom. 1. 28.</p>
            <p>Here it may be demaunded, how mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences shall accuse them in the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if they be thus benummed and seared in this life. <hi>Ansvver.</hi> It is said, Rev. 20. 12. that at the last iudgement all shall be brought before
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:10898:81"/>
Christ, and that the bookes then shall be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: among these bookes, no doubt, conscience is one. Wherefore though a dead conscience in this life be as a closed or sealed booke; because it doeth either little or nothing accuse, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this life, it shall be as a booke laide open: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God shall inlighten it, and so stirre it vp by his mightie power, that it shall be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale and discouer all the sinnes that a man euer committed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Stirring conscience,</hi> is that which doth sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly either accuse or excuse. And it hath soure <note place="margin">Stirring conscience.</note> differences.</p>
            <p>The first which accuseth a man for doing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. This must needes be an euill conscience. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause to accuse is not a property that belongs to it by creation, but a defect that followeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fall. And if the conscience which truely accuseth a man for his sinnes, were a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, then the worst man that is, might haue a good conscience, which cannot be.</p>
            <p>When the accusation of the conscience is more forcible and violent, it is called a <hi>wounded</hi> or <hi>troubled conscience:</hi> which though of it selfe it be not good nor any grace of God; yet by the goodnes of God it serueth often to be an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or preparation to grace; as a needle, that drawes the threede into the cloath, is some
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:10898:81"/>
meanes whereby the cloath is sowed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The second, is that which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap>th for doing well. And it is to be found in them that are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to idolatrie and superstition. As in the Church of Rome: in which, because mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences are insnared and intangled with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane traditions, many are troubled for doing that which is good in it selfe, or at the least a thing indifferent. As for example: let a priest o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to say masse &amp; to say his canonicall houres, his conscience will accuse him therfore: though the omitting of the canonicall houres and the idolatrous masse, be indeede by Gods word no sinne.</p>
            <p>The third, is the conscience which excuseth for doing that which is euill. This also is to be found in them that are giuen to idolatrie and superstition. And there is a particular example hereof, Ioh. 16. 2. <hi>Yea, the time shall come that vvhosoeuer killeth you, will thinke that he doth God good seruice.</hi> Such is the conscience of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish traytours in these daies, that are neuer tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched at all, though they intend and enterprise horrible villanies, and be put to death therefore.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ans dutie concerning conscience is twofold. The first is, if he want <note place="margin">§ 1. Mans first dutie to get good conscience.</note> good conscience aboue all things to labour to obtaine it: for it is not giuen by nature to any man, but comes by grace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:10898:82"/>
For the obtaining of good conscience, three things must be procured; a preparation to good conscience, the applying of the remedie, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of conscience.</p>
            <p>In the preparation, foure things are required. The first is, the knowledge of the lawe, and the particular commaundements thereof, whereby we are taught what is good, what is badde: what may be done, and what may not be done.</p>
            <p>The men of our daies, that they may haue the right knowledge of the law, must lay aside ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny erronious and foolish opinions, which they hold flat against the true meaning of the law of God: otherwise they can neuer be able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne betweene sinne and no sinne. Their espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall and common opinions are these: I. That they can loue God with all their hearts, and their neighbours as themselues; that they feare God aboue all, and trust in him alone; and that they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer did so. II. That to rehearse the Lordes prayer, the beleefe, and 10. commaundements, (without vnderstanding of the words, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out affection) is the true and whole worship of God. III. That a man may seeke to wizzards and soothsayers without offences because God hath prouided a salue for euery sore. IV. That to sweare by good things and in the way of truth, cannot be a sinne. V. That a man going
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:10898:83"/>
about his ordinarie affaires at home or abroad on the sabbath day, may as well serue God as they which heare all the sermons in the world. VI. That religion and the practise thereof, is nothing but an affected precisenes; that coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes the roote of euill, is nothing but world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines; that pride is nothing but a care of honestie and cleanlines, that single fornication is nothing but the tricke of youth; that swearing and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming argue the couragious mind of a braue gentleman. VII. That a man may doe with his owne what he will, and make as much of it as he can. Hence arise all the frauds and badde practises in trafficke betweene man and man.</p>
            <p>The second, is the <hi>knowledge</hi> of the iudiciall sentence of the law, which resolutely pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth that a curse is due to man for euery sinne, Gal. 3. 10. Very few are resolued of the truth of this point, and very few doe vnfainedly beleeue it, because mens minds are possessed with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie opinion, that though they sinne against God, yet they shall escape death and damnation. Dauid saith, <hi>The wicked man,</hi> [that is, euery man naturally] <hi>blesseth himselfe,</hi> Psal. 10. 3. &amp; he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a league with hell and death, Isai. 28. v. 15. This appeareth also by experience. Let the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Gospel reprooue sinne, &amp; denounce Gods iudgements against it, according to the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:10898:83"/>
rule of Gods word, yet men wil not feare: stones will almost as soone mooue in the walls, and the pillers of our Churches, as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> hearts of men. And the reason hereof is, because their minds are forest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lled with this absurd conceit, that they are not in danger of the wrath of God though they o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>end. And the opinion of our common people is hereunto answerable; who thinke, that if they haue a good meaning, &amp; doe no man hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, God will haue them excused both in this life and in the day of iudgement.</p>
            <p>The third, is a <hi>iust</hi> and <hi>serious examination</hi> of the conscience by the lawe, that we may see what is our estate before God. And this is a duty vpon which the Prophets stande very much, Lam. 3. 40. <hi>Man suffereth for sinne let us search and trie our hearts, and turne againe to the Lord.</hi> Zeph. 2. 1. <hi>Fanne your selues, fanne you, O nation, not vvorthie to be loued.</hi> In ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king examination, we must specially take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of that which doth now lie, or may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after lie vpon the conscience. And after <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> examination hath beene made, a man comes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o a knowledge of his sinnes in particular, and of his wretched and miserable estate. When one enters into his house at midnight, he findes or sees nothing out of order: but let him come in the day time when the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> shineth, and

               </gap>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> many faults in the house, and the very motes that flie vp and downe; so let a man search his heart in the ignorance &amp; blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his minde, he will straightway thinke all is well: but let him once begin to search himselfe with the light and lanterne of the law, and he shall sinde many foule corners in his heart and many heapes of sinnes in his life.</p>
            <p>The fourth, is <hi>a sorrovv</hi> in respect of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of sinne, arising of the three former actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. And though this sorrow be no grace; for it befalls as well the wicked, as the godly: yet may it be an occasion of grace, because by the apprehension of Gods anger, we come to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of his mercie. And it is better that conscience should pricke vs and wound vs and doe his worst against vs in this life while reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die may be had, then after this life, when remedy is past.</p>
            <p>Thus much of preparation: now follows the remedie, and the application of it. The remedie is nothing else but the bloode or the merits of Christ, who specially in conscience felt the wrath of God, as when he said, <hi>my soule is heavy vnto death:</hi> and his agonie was not so much a paine and torment in bodie, as the apprehension of the feare and anger of God in conscience: and when the holy Ghost saith, <hi>that he offered vnto
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:10898:84"/>
God praiers with strong cries and was heard fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> feare,</hi> he directly notes the distresse and anguish of his most holy conscience for our sinnes. And as the blood of Christ is an all sufficient remedy, so is it also the alone remedie of all the sores and wounds of conscience. For nothing can stanch or stay the terrours of conscience, but the blood of the immaculate lambe of God: nothing can satisfie the iudgement of the conscience, much lesse the most seuere iudgement of God; but the onely satisfaction of Christ. In the application of the remedie, two things are required: the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel preached, and saith: the Gospell is the hand of God that offereth grace to vs, and faith is our hand whereby we receiue it.</p>
            <p>That we indeede by faith receiue Christ with all his benefits, we must put in practise two les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. The first, is vnfainedly to humble our selues before God for all our wants, breaches and wounds in conscience, which beeing vnto vs as a paradise of God, by our default we haue made as it were a little hell within vs. This hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation is the beginning of all grace and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: pride and good conscience can neuer goe together: and such as haue knowledge in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and many other good gifts without humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, are but vnbridled, vnmortified, and vnrefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med persons. This humiliation containes in it
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:10898:85"/>
two duties, the first is confession of our sinnes, especially of those that lie vpon our consciences; wherwith must be ioyned the accusing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning of our selues: for then we put consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence out of office, &amp; dispatch that labour before our God in this life, which conscience would performe to our eternall damnation after this life. The second dutie is <hi>Deprecation,</hi> which is a kind of praier made with grones and desires of heart, in which we intreat for nothing but for pardon of our sinnes, and that for Christs sake, till such time as the conscience be pacified.</p>
            <p>To this humiliation standing on these two parts, excellent promises of grace and life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting are made, Prov. 28. 13. <hi>He that hideth his sinnes, shall not prosper: but he that confesseth &amp; for saketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shall find mercy.</hi> 1. Ioh. 1. 9. <hi>If we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our sinnes, he is faithfull &amp; iust to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue vs our sinnes, &amp; to clense vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes.</hi> Luk. 1. 35. <hi>He hath filled the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>grie with good things, &amp; sent the rich emptie away,</hi> which are also verified by experience in sundrie exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, 2. Sam. 12. 13. <hi>Dauid said to Nathan, I have sinned against the Lord. And Nathan saide to Dauid, The Lord also hath put away thy sinne.</hi> 2. Chr. 33. 12. <hi>When Manasses was in tribulation, he praied to the Lord his God, and humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe greatly before the God of his fathers: and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:10898:85"/>
prayed vnto him: and God heard his prayer.</hi> Luk. 23. 43. <hi>And the thiefe said to Iesus, Lord remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber me vvhen thou commest to thy kingdome. Then Iesus saide vnto him, Verely I say to thee, to day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</hi> By these and many other places it appeares, that when a man doth truly humble himselfe before God, he is at that instant reconciled to God, and hath the pardon of his sinnes in heauen: &amp; shall afterward haue the assurance thereof in his own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science.</p>
            <p>The second lesson is, when we are touched in conscience for our sinnes, not to yeeld to natural doubtings and distrust; but to resist the same, and to indeauour by gods grace to resolue our selues that the promises of saluation by Christ, belong to vs particularly: because to doe thus much, is the very commandement of God.</p>
            <p>The third thing is, the reformàtion of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <note place="margin">Good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science a fruite of faith.</note> which is, when it doth cease to accuse and terrifie, and begins to excuse and testifie vnto vs by the holy Ghost, that we are the children of God, &amp; haue the pardon of our sinnes. And this it will doe after that men haue seriously hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled themselues, and praied earnestly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly with sighes and grones of spirit for reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God in Christ. For then the Lord will sende downe his spirit into the conscience by a sweete and heauenly testimonie to assure <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:10898:86"/>
that we are at peace with God.</p>
            <p>Thus we see how good conscience is gotten: and because it is so pretious a iewell, I wish all persons, that as yet neuer laboured to get good conscience, now to beginne. Reasons to induce men thereto may be these: I. You seeke day and night from yere to yere for honours, riches, and pleasures, which ye must leaue behinde you: much more threfore ought you to seeke for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and reformed consciences: considering that conscience will be with you in this life, in death, at the last iudgement, and for euer. II. He which wants a conscience purged in the blood of Christ, can neuer haue any true and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting comfort in this life. Suppose a man araied in cloath of tishue, set in a chaire of estate, before him a table furnished with all daintie prouision: his seruants, Monarches, and Princes; his riches the chiefest treasures &amp; kingdoms of the world: but withall suppose one standing by with a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked sword to cut his throat, or a wild beast rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die euer and anon to pull him in pieces: nowe, what can we say of this mans estate, but that all his happines is nothing but woe and miserie? And such is the estate of all men that abounding with riches, honours, and pleasures, carrie about them an euill conscience, which is as a sword to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lay the soule, or as a rauenous beast, readie to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:10898:86"/>
sucke the blood of the soule, and to rend it in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. III. He which wants good conscience can doe nothing but sinne: his very eating and drinking, his sleeping and waking, &amp; al he doth, turnes to sinne: the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science must first be good before the action can be good: if the roote be corrupt, the fruits are answerable. IV. An euill conscience is the greatest enemie a man ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue, because it doth execute all the parts of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against him. It is the Lords sergeant. God neede not send out processe by any of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for man: the conscience within man will arrest him, and bring him before God. It is the gayler to keepe man in prison in bolts &amp; irons, that he may be forth-comming at the day of iudgement. It is the witnes to accuse him, the iudge to condemne him, the hangman to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute him, and the flashings of the fire of hell to torment him. Againe, it makes a man to be an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie to God: because it accuseth him to God, and makes him flie from God as Adam did whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had sinned. Also it makes a man to be his owne enemie, in that it doth cause him to lay violent hands vpon himselfe, and become his owne hangman, or his owne cut-throat. And on the contrarie, a good conscience is a mans best friend: when all men intreat him hardly, it wil speak faire and comfort him: it is a continual
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:10898:87"/>
feast, and a paradise vpon earth. V. The scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture sheweth that they which neuer seeke for good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce, haue terrible ends. For either they die blocks, as Nabal did; or they die desperate, as Cain, Saul, Achitophel, Iudas. VI. We must consider often the terrible day of iudgement, in which euery man must receiue according to his doings. And that we may then be absolued, the best way is to seeke for a good conscience: for if our conscience be euill, and condemne vs in this life, God will much more condemne vs. And wheras we must passe through three iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts the iudgement of men, the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, &amp; the last iudgement of God: we shal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be strengthened against them and cleared in them all, but by the seeking of a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science.</p>
            <p>After that man hath got good conscience, his <note place="margin">§ 2. Mans second du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to keep good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</note> second dutie is to keepe it. And as in gouerning the shippe on the sea, the pilot holding the helme in his hand, hath alwaies an eye to the compasse: so we likewise in the ordering of our liues and conuersations, must alwaies haue a speciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the conscience.</p>
            <p>That we may keepe good conscience, we must doe two things; auoide the impediments thereof, and vse conuement preseruatiues.</p>
            <p>Impediments of good conscience, are either in vs or forth of vs. In vs, on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> owne sinnes and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:10898:87"/>
corruptions. When mens bodies lie deade in the earth, there breed certaine wormes in them whereby they are consumed. For of the flesh come the wormes which consume the flesh: but vnles we take great heed, out of the sinns &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of our hearts, there wil breed a worme a thousand folde more terrible, euen the <hi>worme of conscience</hi> that neuer dieth, which wil in a lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering maner wast the conscience, the soule, &amp; the whole man, because he shal be alwaies dying &amp; neuer dead. These sinnes are specially three; Ignorance, vnmortified affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, worldly lusts.</p>
            <p>Touching the first, namely ignorance, it is a great and vsuall impediment of good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. For when the minde erreth or misconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, it doth mislead the conscience, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the whole man. The way to auoide this impediment is, to doe our indeauour that we may daily increase in the knowledge of the word of God, that it may dwell in vs plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. To this ende we must pray with Dauid, that he would open our eyes, that we might vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the wonders of his law: and withall we must daily search the scriptures for vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as men vse to search the mines of the earth for gold ore, Prov. 2. 4. Lastly, we must labour for spiritual wisedo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that we may haue the right vse of Gods word in euery particular actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:10898:88"/>
being by it directed we may discerne what we may with good conscience do or leaue vndone.</p>
            <p>The second impediment, is vnsta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified affections, which if they may haue their swinge, as wild horses ouerturne the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot with men and all, so they ouerturne &amp; ouer carrie the iudgement &amp; conscience of man: and therfore when they beare rule, good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science takes no place. Now to preuent the danger that comes hereby, this course must be followed. When we would haue a sword or a knife not to hurt our selues or others, we turne the edge of it. And so, that we may preuent our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from hurting and annoying the conscience, we must turne the course of them, by directing them from our neighbours to our selues &amp; our owne sinnes, or by inclining them to God and Christ. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> example: choller and anger directs it selfe vpon euery occasion against our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and thereby greatly indamageth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. Now, the course of it is turned, when we begin to be displeased and to be angry with our selues for our owne sinnes. Our loue set vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the world is hurtfull to the conscience, but when we once begin to set our loue on God in Christ, and to loue the blood of Christ aboue all the world, then contrariwise it is a furtherance of good conscience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:10898:88"/>
The third impediment is worldly lustes, that is, the loue and exceeding desire of riches, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, pleasures. Euery man is as Adam, his good conscience is his paradise; the forbidden fruite is the strong desire of these earthly things; the serpent is the olde e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>my the deuill: who is hee may be suffered to intangle us with the loue of the world, will straight way put us out of out paradise, and barre vs from all good conscience. The remedy is to learne the lesson of Paul, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip. 4. 12. which is, in euery estate in which God shall place vs, to be content; esteeming euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more the present condition the best for us of all. Now that this lesson may be learned wee must further labour to be resolued of Gods speciall prouidence towards vs in euery case and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life: and when we haue so well profited in the schoole of Christ, that we can see and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Gods providence and goodnesse, as well in sicknesse as in health, in pouerty as in wealth, in hunger as in fulnes, in life as in death, we shall be very well content, whatsoeuer any way befalls unto us.</p>
            <p>The preseruatiues of good conscience are two. The first is to preserue and cherish that sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>g faith whereby we are perswaded of our reconciliation with God in Christ, for this is the roote of good conscience as hath bene shewed:
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:10898:89"/>
now this faith is cherished and confirmed by the daily exercises of inuocation and repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which be, to humble our selues, to bewaile and to confesse our sinnes to God, to condemne our selues for them, to pray for pardon &amp; strength against sinne, to praise God &amp; giue him thanks for his daily benefits. Now by the unfained &amp; serious practise of these duties, repentance and faith are daily renued and confirmed. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond preseruatiue is the maintaining of the righteousnesse of a good conscience: which righteousnesse (as I haue said) is nothing els but a constant endeauor and desire to obey the will of God in all things. That this righteousnesse may be kept to the end, we must practise three rules. The first is, that wee are to carry in our hearts <note n="*" place="margin">Conse. bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> non <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candi.</note> a purpose neuer to sinne against God in any thing: for where a purpose is of commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any sinne wittingly and willingly, there is neither good faith nor good conscience. The second is to walke with God, as Enoch did, Genes. 5. v. 24. which is, to order the whole course of our liues as in the presence of God, desiring to approoue all our doings euen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Now this perswasion that wheresoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer we are, we do stand in the presence of God, is a notable meanes to maintaine sinceritie. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. 17. v. 1. <hi>I am God all sufficient, vvalke before
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:10898:89"/>
me and be perfect:</hi> And the want of this is the occasion of many offences: as Abraham saide, <hi>Because I thought, surely the feare of God is not in this place they will slay me for my wiues sake.</hi> Gen. 20. 11. The third rule is, carefully to walke in our particular callings, doing the duties ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the glory of God, to the good of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth and the edification of the Church; auoiding therein fraud, covetousnesse, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, which cause men oftentimes to set their consciences on the tenters, and make them stretch like cheverill.</p>
            <p>Thus we see how good conscience may be preserued. Reasons to induce vs hereunto are many. I. Gods straight commandement. 1. Tim. 1. v. 19. <hi>Keepe faith and good conscience.</hi> And Prover. 4. 23. <hi>Keepe thine heart vvith all dili gence.</hi> II. The good conscience is the most tender part of the soule like to the apple of the eye; which beeing pearced by the least pinne that may be, is not onely blemished, but also looseth his sight. Therefore as God doeth to the eye, so must wee deale with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. God giues to the eye certaine liddes of flesh, to defende and couer it from out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde iniuries: and so must wee vse meanes to auoide, whatsoeuer may offend or annoy conscience. III. Manifold benefits redound
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:10898:90"/>
vnto us by keeping good conscience. First so long as we haue care to keepe it, we keepe and enioy all other gifts of Gods spirit. Good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science and the rest of Gods graces are as a paire of turtle dowes, when the one feeds the other feedeth, when the one likes not the other likes not, when the one dies the other dies: so where good conscience is maintained, there are many other excellent giftes of God flourishing: and where conscience decayes, they also decay. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine good conscience giues alacrity vnto vs &amp; boldnesse in calling on Gods name. 1. Ioh. 3. 21. <hi>If our heart condemne vs not, we have boldnesse towardes God.</hi> Thirdly it makes vs patient in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and comforts vs greatly: and when by reason of the grievousnesse of our affliction, we are constrained to kneele on both knees &amp; take up our crosse, regenerate conscience as a sweete companion layes too his shoulder, and helpes to beare one end of it. Lastly when none can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vs, it will be an amiable comforter and a friend speaking sweetely vnto vs in the very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony and pang of death. IV. Not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the conscience without spot is the way to desperation. It is the pollicie of the deuill to vse meanes to cast the conscience into the sleepe of security, that he may the more easily bring men to his owne destruction. For as diseases, if they
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:10898:90"/>
be long neglected become incurable: so the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science much and often wounded admitts no comfort. Neither will it alwaies boote a man after many yeres to say at the last cast, Lord be mercifull to me, I haue sinned. Though some be receiued to mercy in the time of death, yet farre more perish in desperation, that liued in their sinnes wittingly &amp; willingly against their owne conscience. Pharao, Saul, and Iudas cried all <hi>peccavi,</hi> I haue sinned against God; yet Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rao is hardened more &amp; more &amp; perisheth, Saul goeth on in his sinnes and despaireth, Iudas made away him-selfe. And no maruell, for the multitude of sinnes oppresse the conscience and make the heart to ouerflowe with such a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of griefe, that it can fasten no affiance in the mercy of God. Lastly they that shall neglect to keepe good conscience, procure many hurtes, and dangers, and iudgements of God to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. When a ship is on the sea, if it be not well gouerned, or if there be a breach made into it, it drawes water and sinkes: and so both men and wares and all in likelihood are cast away. Now, we all are as passengers, the worlde is an huge sea through which we must passe: our shippe is the conscience of euery man. 1. Tim. 1. 19. &amp; 3. 12. the wares are our religion and salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and all other giftes of God. Therefore it
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:10898:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>
stands vs in hand to be alwaies at the helme, and to carry our ship with as even a course as possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly we can, to the entended port of happinesse, which is the saluation of our soules. But if so be it we grow carelesse, and make breaches into the shippe of conscience by suffering it to dash upon the rockes of sinne, it is a thousand to one, that we in the end shall cast away our selues and all we haue. And in the meane season, as consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence decayes, so proportionally all grace and goodnesse goes from vs: Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments begin to be vile unto vs; the knowledge thereof, as also faith, hope, and the invocation of Gods name decay. Experience sheweth that men of excellent giftes through the vsing of bad conscience, lose them all.</p>
