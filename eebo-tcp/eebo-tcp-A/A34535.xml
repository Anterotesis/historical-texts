            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THe things here discussed I have studied many
years; and what, by the Writings of Learned
Men, and by discoursing with them, and by
my own ratiocination, grounded on the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scripture, I have apprehended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nearest the
Truth, which I have been feeling after, I have collected in
this narrow Scantling. I have been led into this search, not
out of vain Curiosity, but an honest Desire to gain as clear
a Knowledge in these Points, as I can reach to, that I
might be able with more assurance to unfold the same to
others, as far as is requisite for their Edification.</p>
            <p>Though the Counsels and Wayes of God cannot be found
out unto Perfection, yet the Light, of Scripture and Nature
leads us to think and speak of them so as is most agreeable to
his Infinite Wisdom and Goodness, and so as his Justice and
Truth may be cleared, and the freeness and largeness of his
Mercy magnified, and that the glorious Power of his Grace,
and the deplorable weakness of Fallen Man, may be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
and that penitent Sinners may be sufficiently incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and that the impenitent may be evidently self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61568:3"/>
That which is set down in this Enquiry, is mostly in order
to the clearing and confirming of the Principles here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p>1. The help of Divine Grace is the prime and main
Cause of all the Good that dwells in us, and that is done
by us: But our own Wills are the main Cause of the Evil
that is done by us, and of our abiding in that Evil State into
which our Nature is fallen, and God is no Cause thereof at
all.</p>
            <p>2. God doth decree to bring some to Salvation by his
Free Grace and Love: And he doth not decree to damn any,
but for sin, as the Cause of their damnation; which sin he
doth not decree, nor effect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but foresee.</p>
            <p>3. God doth ascertain the Conversion and Salvation of
his Elect; but he doth not effect it without their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
in a subordinate way. I speak of those that attain
to the use of Reason, not of Infants, Ideots, and Mad-men,
whose Case is of different and peculiar nature.</p>
            <p>4. Though Election doth infer a Certainty that the
Elect shall attain to Grace and Glory; yet Non-election
doth infer no Necessity of the sin and damnation of the
Non-elect, save only that which is called <hi>Necessitas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequentiae,</hi>
or Necessity in order of Argumentation, and is
Necessity but improperly so called, and implies no Necessitation
of the Event.</p>
            <p>5. Though God doth not simply will the Event of the
Conversion and Salvation of all, to whom the Gospel is
made known; yet he wills it so far, and in such manner, as doth
abundantly declare his good will towards men; and doth
assure the diligent of good success in their indeavours; and
doth convict the negligent of being inexcusable despisers of
his Grace towards them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61568:3"/>
6. God hath given us all some help of grace, more or
less, in order to our Spiritual Recovery. The said help may
be improved by us to the obtaining of more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And it is not
Gods ordinary way to deny more help, or to withdraw what is
given, but upon the abuse of what is given, and the resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of what is offered, and for our not doing not only what
we ought, but what we might do.</p>
            <p>According to these Principles I have proceeded. My in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
hath been accompanied with a sense of my own
great defectiveness in the Knowledge of these things: But
I have done, as I was able, and am willing to know where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
soever I have erred. The perfect clearing of all things,
and the solving of all doubts in these Mysterious Points,
may be above the reach of mortal men. The great Apostle said,
<hi>We know but in part.</hi> But Truths of the greatest Moment
and Evidence may not be disbelieved or doubted of, because
we cannot solve all Difficulties about lesser and obscurer
Questions relating to those grand Truths.</p>

            <head>PART I. Of the Decrees of God about
the Actions of Men.</head>
            <div n="1" type="subpart">
               <head>1. What the Divine Decree of an Event doth import.</head>
               <p>TO Decree a Thing, is to will and purpose its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to pass; and it supposeth that the Thing
is judged Convenient. If it be a sure Decree, it
implies that the Decreer can and will so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide,
that it shall infallibly come to pass.</p>
               <p>Gods Decree of an Event, is a willing and purposing of
it as Convenient. Its Convenience he knows by the knowledg
of simple intelligence; and being decreed, he knows it as a
Future Convenient, by the knowledg of Vision, and is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with it.</p>
               <p>As Gods Efficience is concern'd in the Event decreed, the
Decree of the Event includes the Decree of the said Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
That whatsoever God doth in time, he hath eternally
decreed to do, I suppose is unquestionable. And for as much
as no Humane Act comes to pass without his concurse, he
hath undoubtedly decreed the concurse that he yields to it.
And there is the same reason of the Decree of whatsoever on
Gods part is antecedently necessary, as the giving of all Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Power, Preparatives, Means, Concauses, Objects, all
which are unquestionably decreed of God.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="subpart">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:61568:5"/>
               <head>2. The Divine Decree doth not infer the Necessitation of the Event.</head>
               <p>THough the Existence of the Event depends upon Gods
Efficience, yet something thereof he may put under the
Creatures undetermined Liberty. Under this Liberty he may
put the comparative determination of the Will to act rather
than not to act, and to act towards such an Object rather
than another. Surely it is too high presumption for man to
say, that God cannot Decree or firmly Will that humane act,
which is in part suspended on mans Will; for instance, to
say God could not decree <hi>Adam's</hi> Perseverance in the state
of Innocence, if it were in any part left to his own liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to stand or fall.</p>
               <p>Now if such an Assertion be an apparently presumptuous
limitation of God, besides other great inconveniences to be
objected against it, then it may more safely and rationally
be held, that Gods Decree of a humane act is very agreeable
to the leaving of it in some part to the undetermined liberty
of mans will, though to unfold the Agreement be very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to humane Understanding. In short, though the Decree
cannot consist with the contrary Event, yet it may consist
with the possibility of the contrary, and so it doth not in
it self infer a Necessitation of the thing decreed.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="subpart">
               <head>3. The Negation of the Decree doth not infer an impossibility of the Event.</head>
               <p>GOd's Decree is not necessary to an Event, by way of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation;
Consequently the negation of the Decree, is not
a negation of what is causally necessary thereunto; and so
it doth not infer an impossibility thereof. As for Example,
the Negation of Gods Decree of the Persevering Obedience
of some Angels, was not a negation of what was causally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
thereunto, for then their Perseverance had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
which a sober judgment will not admit. The non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existence
of a thing not decreed, follows the negation of the
Decree, only by a necessity of logical illation, but not of
causal deficiency, or by a negation of any necessary Cause.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:61568:5"/>
There is a Power properly so called, or an adequate Power
to an act, wheresoever there is all the necessary causality of
the first Cause, also the Object and its necessary Position, and
the Capacity and necessary Predisposition of the Subject, and
an aptitude of the Natural Powers, and the necessary concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of all Concauses. And all these necessary Antecedents
to an Act may, and commonly do meet, where there is
no Divine Decree of the Act, as is undeniable in the Case
of the lapsed Angels, whose Perseverance was fully Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
yet certainly not Future.</p>
               <p>As Man hath a power to do that which God foreknows
he will not do, so he hath a Power to do that, which God
hath not decreed that he shall do.</p>
               <p>As it is rightly said, that it Cannot come to pass that
any Good will exist without the Divine Decree; so it is as
rightly said, that it Cannot come to pass that any Good will
exist without the Divine Prescience. But the Cannot in
both Instances is in respect of Illation, not of Causation.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="subpart">
               <head>4. The indetermination of Mans Will doth not infer the Vncertainty
of God's Decree.</head>
               <p>A Thing may be certainly Future that is under the unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
liberty of the Will. Mans Power and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of doing otherwise than God hath decreed, doth no more
infer a possibility of the frustration of his Decrees, than his
Power and Liberty of doing otherwise, than God hath fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
he will do, doth infer an uncertainty of Gods fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg.
Now it is undeniable, that God can certainly
foreknow, that a man will do that which he hath power not
to do; and that he will not do that which he hath power
to do. <hi>Adam</hi> had power to resist the Temptation, which
God foreknew he would yield to.</p>
               <p>The Power it self to do otherwise than as God hath decreed,
is foreknown and decreed; and it is also foreknown and
decreed, That the said Power shall not do otherwise, God's
Decree is according to his Foreknowledg, which is to us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible.</p>

               <head>5. God decrees all the Good that comes to pass.</head>
               <p>IT is the perfection of God, as God, to be the Author of
all Good as well Moral as Physical, as well of common
as of saving Grace. And to be the Author of it, is to decree
and procure that it be done.</p>
               <p>As it is the perfection of the Divine Intellect to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
all that is Intelligible; so it is the perfection of the
Divine Will to chuse all that is eligible, or fittest to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
to come to pass.</p>
               <p>It is agreeable to the perfection of Gods Providence,
that all the Good that is done in the World, should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed,
and infallibly brought to pass by him.</p>
               <p>As undoubtedly God doth effect every good Act that comes
to pass, so undoubtedly he doth decree it. For whatsoever
is the Object of Divine Operation is also the Object of
Divine Volition.</p>
               <p>Every good Act is an End, or a Means to an End, in
the Course of Gods Providence; and therefore it is decreed
of him. All the Ends of Providence are determined, and
consequently the Meanes to be made use of for the same
are likewise determined.</p>
               <p>Though I do not affirm, that Gods Foreknowledg and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
are of equal extent, yet it seems not congruous that his Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
should be active, and his Purpose or Will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to any future Good.</p>
               <p>Gods Foreknowledg of Evil infers, though not a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of it, yet a Decree about it, that it shall be so and so
disposed of for good; so that by those, who do what he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
not, he accomplisheth what he willeth.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="6" type="subpart">
               <head>6. God doth not Will or Decree Sin.</head>
               <p>IT must needs be held that whatsoever God doth, he wills
to do; and whatsoever is the Effect of his agency, he
wills the same. Consequently, whatsoever he doth about a sinful
Act, he wills to do it; and whatsoever is the Effect of his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61568:6"/>
Agency about the said Act, he wills the same. Now there
is a concurse of God, as the Universal Cause, to every Act,
and therefore to every sinful Act as an Act; that is, to so much
as is in the general Nature of the said act. And so much
as this comes to, he wills, which is not Sin, but only the
<hi>Substratum Peccati.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as he doth not concur to the sinful Act, as it is this
Act in <hi>specie,</hi> and not the contrary; so he doth not Will and
Decree the Act, as such in <hi>specie.</hi> How the Divine concurse is
yielded to sinful actions, shall be explained in it proper place,
under the Head of Gods Efficience.</p>
               <p>God Permitteth Sin. But to Permit Sin is not to Will
it, but only not to Prevent its coming to pass.</p>
               <p>God doth not Will the Essence, therefore he doth not
Will the Event or Existence of sin. For the Existence of
sin is but its Essence <hi>extra causas,</hi> or in actual being. To
say that God doth not Will the Essence of sin, but that
the Essence thereof exist, is very odd, and to me unintelligible.
The Event or Existence of Sin is the Object of Gods Hatred,
therefore it cannot be the Object of his Will. For the doth
not Will what he hates.</p>
               <p>If God willeth the Existence of Sin, he willeth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
of it; and if he willeth the committing of sin,
then the committing of Sin is the fullfilling of his Will;
and if it be the fullfilling of his Will, it is the Object of
his Complacence, and then he hath Complacence in the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation
of his Law.</p>
               <p>Sin hath no Good in it, and it works no good. 'Tis not
sin, but the feeling knowledg of sin, that works Humillation
and repentance.</p>
               <p>It is to be noted, That God doth not Will whatsoever
he doth not Nill. Between Volition and Nolition there is a
middle thing, <hi>viz.</hi> Non-volition.</p>
               <p>Though God doth not simply Nill the Existence of sin,
yet he Nills it so far, as that he hates it, and severely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
it, and gives Necessary Power to avoid it.</p>

               <head>7. there is no need of holding that Sin is decreed of God.</head>
               <p>IF the aforesaid Arguments be not strong enough to prove,
That God doth not decree Sin; yet there is no need for
any one, in order to the salving of Gods Providence; to hold
that he doth decree it.</p>
               <p>The Existence of Sin, foreseen indeed, but not decreed,
God makes advantage of for his Holy Ends, it being under
his Ruling Power. He Wills the Good occasioned by Sin, but
he Wills not Sin as the occasion of Good. All the Good that
follows Sin (not as the End follows the Means, but as health
follows the disease) is decreed of God.</p>
               <p>Seeing God over-rules all the Inclinations and Actions of
his Creatures, his not decreeing of Sin doth not at all lessen
his Providence about sinful Actions.</p>

            <div n="8" type="subpart">
               <head>8. A Decree to permit Sin is not necessary.</head>
               <p>TO Permit, is not to Act, and not to Act is nothing;
and of nothing there is no Decree, at least there is no
need of a Decree. No more is needful to a Not-being, than
Gods not Willing and not Effecting. Consequently, there is
no Decree of the Permission of Sin, at least, there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of holding such a Decree.</p>
               <p>It may be Objected, That a <hi>Non-esse</hi> is the Object of Gods
Will, when he wills that some Evil Action shall not come to
pass. The answer is, That in such a case the thing that God
properly wills, is his restraining and limiting of mens evil In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
and Actions, and the <hi>Non-esse</hi> of those Actions is
said to be willed by him, but improperly and reductively,
as being the Consequent of that which he properly Wills.
And his Will is further terminated on the good Consequence
of his preventing the said Evil Actions.</p>
               <p>It may be likewise objected, If a man may rightly say, I
will or Purpose to permit, why may not God rightly say
so? The answer is, that when a man makes such a Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
it commonly means a Purpose of restraining the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61568:7"/>
Inclination or Will, that is or may be in him, to hinder
the thing; and the said Purpose is further terminated on the
Consequents of the Permission, and the ordering of them. So
God may be said to Will, or Purpose a Permission, as he
wills or purposeth the limiting of his restraining Agency,
and as this Will and purpose is also terminated on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents
of the thing permitted, and the disposal thereof by
his Providence.</p>

               <p>THough God decree no mans sin, yet he may decree the
Effect which sinners cause by sin. So God decreed the
death of Christ, and the passive constupration of <hi>David's</hi>
Concubines, but he decreed not the sin of the Actors.
Accordingly such places of holy Scripture, as seem to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
Gods Willing the sins of men, do indeed signifie no
more than the Effects of their sins as willed by him.</p>
               <p>Though sin hath no Good in it, and works nothing Good
in it self, and cannot be willed of God as a thing conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
or conducible; yet it may be an occasion of the greatest
Good, and it may work an Effect, which, though bad in it
self, (I mean Physically bad) may be conducible to Good, and
so far the Effect may be willed as convenient.</p>
               <p>If it be objected, That a Decree of the Effect (one would
think) doth imply a Decree of the Cause. The answer is,
1. That the meer decreeing of a thing, includes no more than
a willing that it shall be, joyned with a Knowledg of its
convenience. And so a Decree of the Effect of sin, doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
a Foreknowledg of the conducibility of that Effect to
some Good; yet it no way implyes a Decree of the sin, but
only a Foreknowledg of it. 2. Though God doth not De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
mans sin, yet he decrees his own concurse to the Act in
its general nature, but not as morally specified. He decrees
also the disposing and ordering of all Concauses and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Antecedents of the Effect, which sinners accomplish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

of them as divers.</p>

               <p>All the Decrees of God are executed in certain Order,

And the Order of the Decrees, as to our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension

               <p>That God doth in Certain Persons effect all the Conditions

Efficacy of his own Grace which he hath purposed towards

There is indeed a Decree, that all, without exception, by

this is no other than the decreeing of the general Law of

               <p>God acts by his Essence, and not by an Act, that is an

his Essence and mans Act, effected by the said agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
may be above the understanding of mortals to apprehend.
Some Express it by an inward urgency to the act, whereby
the mind is more disposed to it, than it was before. All
that I can speak of it is this, That the said urgency denotes
no act of God besides his Essence, but it is God himself
so urging or influencing the mind of man without any alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

               <p>IT is most generally and safely said by Divines, that Gods
Acts on the part of the Agent are all one, and all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,
as being his Essence; and that on the part of the
Objects and Effects they are many, and some of them new
and temporary. It is likewise wisely and humbly said, that
the comprehending of this passeth the understanding of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
men.</p>
               <p>In a sinners turning to God, and in every holy act, there
is besides a common concurse from God, as the Fountain of
Nature, a special Influence from him, as the Fountain of Grace.
The diversity of the said Concurse and Influence is undiscer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nible
by us in it self, but in the Effects it is made manifest
to us. And that, which on Gods part hath no difference, is
diversified to us in the Effect.</p>

               <p>GOds Agency upon Mans will is not always in the same,
but generally in very different degrees. For he doth not
operate to the uttermost, or to the infinity of his Power, in
every Effect that is wrought by him. It is true, that God
is Infinite in Power, and whatsoever he doth, he doth it
with an omnipotent facility. But that his Power is equally
or always irresistibly put forth in all his Agency on the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

that whatsoever is brought to pass, comes under the highest

               <p>THat in some Cases God should Irresistibly Predetermine
the Will to a good Act, is not against its Essential Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
For such Predetermination is not inconsistent with a
Self-determining Power, but only supposeth it to be subject
to God's Omnipotence. And it being to a good act, it is
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61568:13"/>
a Premotion perfective of our Nature, and to its well-being,
and therefore not unbecoming the Goodness of God.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless the being of all Moral Good doth not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
require such Predetermination, but God may so operate,
as to leave the Effect in part to the liberty of Mans Will.
Otherwise a man could do no good, to which he is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated.
Yet when man doth his part, he doth it not inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently

are other Causes evidently in conjunction with him, their
own share in producing the Effect may be ascribed to them,
without Impeachment of his honour. But it must be also
considered, that they have all their Causation from him and
in him.</p>
               <p>God, and nothing besides him, is the Cause of his own
Act, and so far he is both a total and solitary Cause: But
he is not the sole Cause of Mans Act, because man himself is
a Cause thereof in Subordination to him. Yet he is a total Cause
of the Act done by man, as it is an Act, and of all that is
laudable in the Act. For none is coordinate with him or assistant
to him in his Agency. And whatsoever man doth, be it that
wherein his Privilege is greatest, <hi>viz.</hi> the determining of his

it is a Distinction that I understand not. For, the Act is

               <p>The Power here supposed to be given, is seated in the
Will; and the Will by it is supposed to be fully enabled and
sufficiently excited to act. For God to give to will and to
do, I cannot comprehend what it is, more than to give that

therein give the Act it self. He that gives the Power of
Self-excitation to the Act, and of all other Indeavour, gives
that very Self-excitation and Indeavour, when it is in Act.
And how God should have an Influx upon the Act otherwise,
than by his Influx on the Agent, to give him active Power
and Vertue, I cannot conceive.</p>

               <p>THe denying that God by his Efficience causeth mans Will

the affirming that the sinful Act, as morally specified, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised

as the first Determining Principle, not predetermined, is less
to be dreaded from the imagined Consequence of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of Deities, or the Creatures Independency, than the
contrary Opinion is from those Consequences which really
and palpably follow upon it.</p>
               <p>The truth is, that Faculty, which cannot act without an

               <p>Duely to consider how much every action of the Creature

that be held, the thing that is now in debate, is not so much
as Action <hi>qua</hi> Action, but a Mode of Action. And be it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
whether in such a Mode of Action the Humane Will
may not be the first determining Principle, without the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying
of Independent Beings, when the very self-determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Faculty, and its Power of acting in such a Mode, is
wholly of God, and is conserved in active power by him
in every Instance; and when God doth concur to that Act
in <hi>genere Actus,</hi> and that, which is left to the Self-determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

to all Humane Acts.</head>
               <p>THough I have a veneration for some men, both for their
Learning and Godliness, who held Physical Predetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to all Humane Acts, as well bad as good; yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
receive the Opinion in regard of its Consequences. For
from this Opinion it will follow, that all the sin that is done
in the world can no more be avoided, than Omnipotence be
overcome; that a man could no more do that Good Act,
whereof his sin is the Privation, than he could make the
world; that all the sinful Deficiency that is in the world ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably
comes from the Negation of that Divine Efficience,
which is absolutely necessary to prevent it; that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
made with <hi>Adam</hi> in innocence, and all the Laws of God
that have been violated, were impossible to be observed; that
when God hath Necessitated the Violation of his Law, he
Punisheth that Violation with Everlasting Punishments.</p>
               <p>I do not charge those that held the Opinion, but the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
it self, with these Consequences. And in this case, to
say that man sins Voluntary and upon Choice, and therefore
deservedly incurs the Punishment, is but to put off a very
harsh matter with fair words. For if it be a Choice, it is such
a Choice as is made under an Invincible Necessitation. And if
this be not to sin under a meer Natural Necessity of sinning,
what is?</p>

Gods Act, yet he doth not properly cause the penal sin;

and which is forfeited by the abuse of Grace already recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
He doth also justly expose the sinner to more and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

of former sin, certainly follows. But there is no Causation
or Agency of God to the effecting of the sin; only by his

               <p>IF the Humane Will had been bent to sin by a Natural Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
as the fire burns, sin must have necessarily followed
upon the permission of it. But first man sinned with Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

and therefore the bare Permission of it, which is no more
than a Non-prevention, doth not infer a Necessity of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
Nor did it causally ascertain the Event of sin. For
it hath no Causation in it.</p>
               <p>Yea, the first man sinned not only by Free Choice, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Previous Inclination to it, but also against a Holy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to Obedience, called Original Righteousness. This
holy Inclination, though it was not so natural, as burning
is to fire, that is, naturally inseparable, yet it was necessary
to Humane Nature in its right state, and as it first came out
of its Makers Hands; and under the Necessary Influence of
God, which was with him, it was so fully sufficient to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance
in that state, that his sin was a matter of inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable
Ingratitude, and high Contempt of the Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

               <p>In the state of Fallen Nature the Will hath lost its Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to acts conformable to Gods Law, and is enslaved to sin.
And while God permits him to abide in this state, man sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
Necessarily; yet not by reason of Gods Permission, but
his own Vicious Inclination. This Necessity of Sinning is
not purely Natural but Moral, which is also Voluntary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from no other Cause, than the obstinate Depravedness
of the Will it self, which is not to be conquered by its own

graciously vouchsafed on Gods part, in order to mans Duty
and Felicity, whether it be the Divine Operation or the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
hereof in man. Sometimes men call the first saving O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
of God to the renewing of the Soul, by the name
of the First Grace; but it is not so indeed. For abundant
and manifold Grace is vouchsafed before that. Whatsoever
is from God over and above Humane Nature, and Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and his general concurse, in themselves considered, is to
be comprehended under this Term.</p>
               <p>Nature, and Gods upholding thereof, in it self considered, is
not to be called Grace; but Gods reprieving of Nature, in
order to its recovery, is his Grace through-Christ; and so
the continuing of our Reason and Free Will, and all our

For Grace doth not put into us any such thing as we call a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61568:17"/>
Natural Faculty, but the Rectitude of the Faculty, or that
which tends thereunto. And all the degrees of the healing
and restoring of our depraved lapsed Nature, are so many
degrees of Grace obtained for us by Christ. In sum, under

               <head>2. The meaning of some Distictions of Grace, that are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
used.</head>
               <p>THere is Grace Objective and Subjective. By Objective
Grace is meant the Law or Covenant of Grace, which
is stiled in Scripture, <hi>the Grace of God that bringeth salvation,</hi>
together with all the external Signs and Evidences thereof,
either in the Works of God and the course of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
towards Mankind, or in his written Word. By
Subjective Grace is meant all internal gracious operations of
God on man, over and above his general concurse, together
with the impression and disposition made thereby in the
Soul.</p>
               <p>There is Grace Common and Special. By Common Grace
many understand that which is common, not to all, but to
more than the Elect; and by Special Grace that which is
peculiar to the Elect, or to a state of Salvation. But these
terms are not necessarily restrained to this meaning. For
there is a common Grace, not only as given to more than
the Elect, but as given to all men. And there is a Special
Grace, wherein God freely favours one man more than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and yet it may be below that which is peculiar to a
state of Salvation.</p>
               <p>Grace of the same kind may be considered as given to
several persons in equal or unequal measure.</p>
               <p>There is also Grace Sufficient and Grace Effectual. Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Grace is that, by which we can do the Good, to which
it is said to be sufficient, and without which we cannot do
it; and therefore it is also called Necessary Grace. Effectual
Grace is that, which, as such, doth take Effect, and is never
frustrate.</p>

               <p>I Think the Notion of Grace ought not to be restrained
to Favours or Benefits vouchsafed to some and not to
others; but whatsoever God gives, which in his Justice ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Law of Works he might refuse to give, is
truly called Grace, though it be given to all. And the most
Common Grace is so far of free-choice, as that God might
justly have refused to give it.</p>
               <p>That there is an universal Objective Grace, appears by the
general Law of Grace, or the Conditional Grant of Life and
Salvation to all Mankind.</p>
               <p>The Grace of the external Signes and Evidences of the
said General Grant is likewise Universal in some degree.
For in the course of Gods Providence towards Mankind, his
mercy to sinners is very legible, particularly his Reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness
to them upon their Repentance. The Mercy of
God towards men in general tends to lead them to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and seeking after God. <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 27. And this
supposeth God to be reconcileable, otherwise there were no
ground for Repentance.</p>
               <p>If there be such Universal Objective Grace, what hinders
that there should not be Universal Subjective Grace pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
thereunto? <hi>viz.</hi> some Help from God to dispose
the Minds of Men to own and accept his Mercy, and to seek
to be reconciled to him. Yea, I think that the former is in
vain without the latter, because it cannot be made use of. So
far am I from apprehending that Universal Grace is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy.</p>
               <p>It may be further noted, That in this Unversal Grace, that
Notion of Free-choice in preferring one before another, takes
place so far, as that it is vouchsafed only to Fallen Men
and not to Angels.</p>

given. If we suppose that those words of our Saviour,
<hi>[To him that hath shall be given]</hi> are to be understood only
in <hi>eodem genere,</hi> even then he that improves the more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
or Preparatory Grace, shall receive more in that kind,
and he that improves Renewing Grace, shall receive more
in that kind.</p>
               <p>Many do not improve the Divine Help already received,
and they do not attain to that more abundant Help, that would
enable them to do Actions savingly good, because they are wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to themselves. A Price is put into the Hand of a Fool
for the gaining of Wisdom, and he hath no heart to it.
So that men perish for the neglect and abuse of those Helps
which they have received, and for want of those further Helps
which they have resisted and rejected.</p>

               <head>5. Of Grace sufficient to that Good which is not Effected
by it.</head>
               <p>THat is sufficient Grace, which gives a Power, properly
so called, that is to say, an adequate Power to that
Good, which should be effected by it. A Physical without
a Moral Power, that is, a Natural Faculty without a due
disposedness, and much more with an obstinate depravedness,
is not an adequate Power to a morally good Act, that is,
to an Act conformable to Gods Law. But he hath a Power
adequate to a good Act, who is able to move his Will to it,
and to bring it forth without the addition of more Power,
or more antecedent Help of Grace, and whose indisposition
to it, or disposition to the contrary, is no other, but what
may be, and sometimes is overcome by that Power.</p>
               <p>The Grace, that gives the Power here described, is rightly
called sufficient Grace. The existence of this Grace doth
well consist with these Principles, that God is the Author
of all Good, as well Moral as Physical; and that there is a
Divine Predefinition and Efficience of all the Good that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
comes to pass. But it supposeth also, that all Moral
Good doth not depend on Gods Physical Predetermination,
or Necessitating Premotion of Mans Will thereunto, but that
good Acts may be effected without the said Predetermination
or Premotion.</p>
               <p>If there be no such Divine Grace or Help, as is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to some Good, which is not effected by it, then no man
hath or ever had a Power, properly so called, to do more
Good than he doth, and to avoid more Evil than he doth,
for lack of further Necessary Help from God. And if no
man hath or ever had Power to do more Good, or to avoid
more Evil than he doth, for lack of something to be given
him of God, as causally necessary thereunto, then all sin of
Omission and Commission is resolved at least into Gods Non-Volition
and Non-efficience, as the prime Reason thereof, in
the Negation of his Necessary Help.</p>

Though Gods Providence towards his Rational Creatures
be a Depth unfadomable, yet who would easily admit such
a Position, the evident Consequence whereof will be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
of all sin into the Will of God? Nor may that be
admitted for the only way of Divine Efficience on Mans Will,
the continued existence whereof is repugnant to the Wills
defectibility, and the Negation whereof infers a Necessity
of its Defection, and so brings all its Acts under a Kind of
Fatality. I doubt not but God hath afforded us so much
light into his mysterious ways, as to clear them from any
such Consequences.</p>

               <head>6. Some undeniable Instances of Grace sufficient.</head>
               <p>THat <hi>Adam</hi> had Divine Help, and a Moral Power suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to his Perseverance, though he did not persevere,
must be granted, or else it will follow, that God antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to his Fall was wanting to him in Necessaries, and that
he fell, because he had not Power to stand, which Consequence
is intolerable. His <hi>posse stare si vellet,</hi> could be no less than
a <hi>posse velle stare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whether <hi>Adam's</hi> Original Righteousness were to be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Natural or Supernatural, it makes no difference in our
Inquiry. For most certainly it was the Gift of God, and
his Workmanship, and it was upheld in him, while it remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
by God's Conserving Influence; and God gave him that
Inherent Rectitude, and that assistant Influence which was
sufficient for him. And though it was not remedying Grace,
which is proper to fallen man, yet it was Divine Help, which
sufficeth to the point here in question. And it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
called Grace, because it came from God, not as the
Fountain of Nature only, but of Grace.</p>
               <p>It is more than can be proved, that <hi>Adam</hi> had not that
Assistant Grace, and that Power, which had the same proportion
for his perseverance, with that Grace and Power, which the
Elect Angels had for their Perseverance before their Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.
Yea, it cannot be proved that the Elect Angels had
more Help of Grace from God before their Confirmation,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61568:19"/>
than the Reprobate Angels had before their Fall. But how
ever it be, the Reprobate Angels unquestionably had suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>
               <p>Regenerate persons have that Help of Grace, whereby
they are enabled to do more Good in the Saving Kind, than
they do. And the unregenerate have that Help of a moer
Common Grace, whereby they may do more Good in the
Common Kind, than they do. Both Regenerate and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate
have not only a Physical but a Moral and ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate
Power to many good Acts of Saving or Common
Grace, which are not done.</p>
               <p>In the aforesaid Instances it is to be noted, that the suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Grace is <hi>efficax ad posse;</hi> and in this regard that Rule,
<hi>posita causa in actu sequitur effectus,</hi> is not here gainsaid. For
sufficient Grace, where the good Act doth not follow, is <hi>causa
in actu</hi> only of the <hi>posse</hi> or moral Power, which Effect exists,
and so the Operation is not without Effect. And the good
Act doth not follow, because the Moral Power given by
sufficient Grace is in act of Existence only, but not of Causa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>There may be Grace sufficient to certain Acts tending to

remotely, and in a lower degree tending to Conversion, which
is not sufficient to acts more nearly, and in a higher degree
tending to it.</p>
               <p>Grace sufficient to an Act tending to Conversion may be

               <p>I grant, that a sinners Conversion may be an Effect of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

than the good Acts of the Regenerate are. For there was
in <hi>Adam,</hi> and there is in the Regenerate an active holy Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
or Disposition. I grant, that Man in his fallen state
doth need a change of the Will, which <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall
did not, and the Regenerate do not need. But this Change
of the will is no other than Conversion it self. And why
there may not be sufficient grace to change the Will, when
it is not changed, I cannot discern. If any shall say there
is no such Grace, he ought to prove it from the Evidence
of Scripture, or from the impossibility of the thing.</p>

               <head>8. Whether the Holy Habit be effected before the first
Act of turning to God.</head>
               <p>IT may be objected, That the effecting of the Habit, Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
or Principle in the Soul, wherein man is meerly
passive, is first in order of Nature, and the Soul's act of
turning to God, is consequent to it. And consequently there
can be no Sufficient Grace to Conversion, but that which
doth effect it, and no man hath a Power to turn to God
before the Holy Principle is infused.</p>
               <p>To this I answer, That this Hypothesis (to say the least)
is unnecessary and unproved. In what the Nature of a Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
doth consist is not easy to be understood, as whether it
be the firmness and vigor of the natural Faculty to such acts,
or a secret inperceptible constant act in the soul. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be the one or the other, there is no reason, why it
must needs go before the act. I apprehend that the Act of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61568:20"/>
turning to God is before that Holy Habit or fixed Principle
which is called the New Nature; at least that it may be so,
and that most ordinarily. This way is more congruous to
Gods Means of Conversion, which work in the Nature of
Moral Causes, that do not immediately beget the Habit, but the
holy act or acts, and the habit by the mediation thereof. And in
this case the influx and impress of Divine Grace is instead of the
holy habit. And the habit may be said to be infused, when
the Spirit of God doth excite the soul to the act, and by
that act or acts bring it to a setled habit. Any other way
of infusing habits, I confess, I am not able to apprehend.</p>
               <p>If the Will doth, without a precedent habit, move to a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
good by the influx of the Holy spirit, it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that a man moves without a Principle, meerly by an
extrinsick agency. For the Will it self, excited by Divine
Grace, is an intrinsick principle of Motion. As a man moves
himself by the locomotive faculty, so he wills the Object by
the volitive faculty; and the act of Conversion is not by Gods
extrinsick agency alone, but also by an intrinsick Principle,
the will it self.</p>
               <p>It is not necessary that the Will of a drunkard be habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
changed from drunkenness to sobriety, before any acts of
sobriety can be performed by him. And though there be a
greater change in sanctifying than in civilizing a man, yet
as a civil or common act may precede a habit, so may a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
act.</p>
               <p>If a man may commit a sinful act, without a previous sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Habit, as <hi>Adam</hi> did, and that from the intrinsick Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of his own Free Will, why may he not by the assistance
of Divine Grace bring forth a Holy Act, without a previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Holy Habit?</p>

               <p>WHen mans evil Inclination hinders the good Effect
that might come to pass through Divine Grace, it
is not because the evil Inclination is in it self stronger than
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61568:21"/>
the Grace, which we call sufficient, but because the Will
makes not use of that sufficient help. In this case the Will
is not so far weak or obnoxious to depraved Inclination, but
that by the assistance of the Grace given it might prevail
against it, and effect the Good that is designed in that As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance.
God giveth sufficient Help, and they to whom it
is given, neglect it, and give way to the prevalence of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
which might have been overpower'd by it. Though
none will say that Medicaments are Sufficient, which are not

               <p>If it be objected, That the will it self resists the Divine
Help that is given, and as stronger than it overcomes it: I
answer, that which is here called Resistance is not the Wills
reaction upon the Divine Help, or a breaking of its force;
but it is partly its wilful aversness from making use of that
Help, and its not acting according to it, and partly its will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
rejecting of it, and hardening it self against it. In the
mean time the said Divine Help is in its full force and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and sufficient to the designed Good, and so remains, till
God withdraws it in his just indignation against the sinners
wilful neglect and abuse of it.</p>

God antecedently is equal.</head>
               <p>THe measure and proportion of Divine Help given, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be alike to all, is to come under consideration.
In equal Grace there is not only an equality of Divine
Influx on the Soul, but also of External Means and Helps,
and an equal felicity of concurring Circumstances, which
make for that good which is to be effected thereby. Yea
that Grace may be in every respect equal, there must be an
equality of need in the persons receiving it. For where there
is more need, the same degree of Divine Help is a lesser
degree of Grace, respectively considered, than where there is
lesser need; as the same sum of money given to one, that is
more in want, is a lesser ayd to him, than to another that
wants less.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:61568:21"/>
A lesser degree of Divine Grace in one kind, may be made
up by a greater Degree thereof in another kind; and so
he that receives less in one kind, than what another hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in the same, may be equal in the receiving of Grace
with that other, by receiving more than he in another
kind.</p>
               <p>It is not against the Righteousness or Goodness of God
to vouchsafe a greater Degree of his Gracious Help to some
more than to others, whose condition towards him antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
and in themselves, is equal. God, considered as a
Rector, renders equally to all that are of equal merit or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
but as a Proprietor, or Lord of his own, he is not
bound to equality. For he may do with his own what he
Will, and none can challenge him for doing more for some
than for others, when he doth for all, as much as is meet
for him to do. And thereupon he gives to some, as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
such proportions of Grace, to which he gave them
no antecedent right by his Law of Grace, or any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</p>

               <p>3. That Grace, that ascertains the Effect, is not necessary
to make it possible. The negation of the Decree of the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in some doth not make it impossible to be in them, as
hath been before proved. The negation of the decree of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam's</hi>
Perseverance did not make it impossible.</p>
               <p>4. There is no repugnancy that something be sufficient to
an Effect, and yet never produce it. For if the Effect may
not follow in one instance, it may possibly not follow in a
thousand, or ten thousand instances of the same Reason.
This holds undoubtedly in Effects produced in Free Agents,
and to which their free concurrence is requisite; and that
the Effect doth not follow, it comes not from any antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Necessity, or because something necessary to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
therof was wanting.</p>

               <head>19. In what manner of Operation Grace formally Effectual
doth consist.</head>
               <p>EFfectual Grace is a special Operation of God on the
Soul, by Internal Influx, in conjunction with all sutable
means, (wherewith the Infinite Divine Wisdom is furnished
to every purpose) by which the Effect is ascertained. But
what is the special manner of this Operation is not easily
to define. God can work effectually in divers Ways, and
by us incomprehensible.</p>
               <p>I cannot say, that his Physical Predetermination, or Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitating
Premotion of the Will to a good act, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
to Conversion, cannot in any case be, nevertheless
it need not be insisted on, because by a way of Moral Agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
God can infallibly cause the Will to determine it self.</p>
               <p>In this way of Moral Agency God can put forth an insu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable
Efficacy of Divine Grace, so as therein to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the Moral, though not the Physical Power to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
Which to do is not against the Liberty of the
Will, but makes it more perfect. For an indetermination
of the Faculty to Will or not to Will, the Good that ought
to be willed, is but its liberty in a state of tryal.</p>
               <p>Moreover God can work effectually by such a degree or
manner of Operation, as leaves in the Will a Moral Power
to the contrary, or which leaves the Effect in part to the
un determined Liberty of the Will. And in this manner he
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61568:24"/>
can certainly bring to pass mans Conversion. Who can say
that God could not have infallibly effected <hi>Adam</hi>'s Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
by such an Operation, as should leave the Effect in
part to his Will, or that he did not in that manner effect
the Perseverance of the Elect Angels before their Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p>That a thing should be ascertained, to the Opposite where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the Will of man will determine it self, is indeed a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy.
But it is no repugnancy that a thing should be
ascertained, to the Opposite whereof the Will of man may
determine it self.</p>

               <p>THat Divine Grace, which effects mans Conversion, not

congruous Vocation, in which there is a Divine gracious

Gospel presented to it, with all concurring sutable Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
by which the Will is infallibly carried to the saving
Effect, by a free and sweet Motion, without any proper Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitation.</p>
               <p>The Doctrine of congruous Grace is not to be rejected

               <p>Against the explication of Effectual Grace here given, if

that by congruous is meant that which is so thoroughly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted

but Grace, meerly sufficient, may be ordinarily not so
throughly adapted to the Effect, being not in so high a degree
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61568:25"/>
or specialty of Convenience to such a particular Will; and yet
it may not be simply incongruous, but so far congruous,
as to be fully so much as is necessary and sufficient to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the Effect, though it follow not.</p>

is always a difference, <hi>ex parte influxus divini,</hi> between that
which effects, and that which effects not; It may lye in the
different congruity of the Means and circumstantial Helps,

be noted, That the said congruous Means, circumstantial Helps,

               <p>I doubt not but Effectual Grace may take hold of a less
prepared Subject, I mean less prepared even in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
immediately before Conversion; also that it may work
by less sutable means. Yet I believe, that as in the Works
of Nature, so in the Works of Grace, God doth more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
work upon the more prepared Subjects, and by the
more congruous ways and means.</p>
               <p>That Scripture, <hi>Tit. 3. 5. Not by works of righteousness which
we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us,</hi> expresly
speaks of Salvation, and not of the first Conversion. And it
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61568:25"/>
doth not intend the excluding of Faith, Repentance, and
Obedience in order to Salvation, but the Works of Legal
Righteousness. If the first Conversion be comprehended in
the Salvation there spoken of, yet it doth not intend the
excluding of Necessary Preparedness, but it may intend to
exclude the necessity of the Works of Natural Righteousness,
and that kind of Vertue that is in meer Natural Men, and
was found in many Heathens.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Paul</hi>'s Conversion, it is an extraordinary Instance,
and may not be urged against what is done in Gods ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
way. Towards unprepared Souls, suddenly converted,
there is an extraordinary Operation of God, both in respect
of the Internal Impress on the Soul, and the extraordinary
Outward Means. Moreover, none can disprove a more spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
preparedness in <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Manasse,</hi> or other most heinous
Offenders, in some instant of time before the Saving

               <p>Receptivity and Congruity for <hi>Grace</hi> doth not always-lye
in mens fair carriage, or more orderly behaviour, or in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

by the review thereof.</p>

               <head>23. How the Effect of Grace, left in part to undetermined
Free-will, can be ascertained.</head>
               <p>WHatsoever Contingency be in the Created Will, and
uncertainty thereupon in the Created Intellect, with
God there can be no Uncertainty, no nor Contingency, any
otherwise than as it denotes Liberty.</p>
               <p>To remove Uncertainty about Events from God, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it is not necessary to hold either a naturally necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Premotion, or an insuperable Moral Operation upon
Free Agents to all their Acts. All that I can say in this
difficulty is, That God can and doth, in a way past our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61568:26"/>
ascertain Events left in some part to mans Unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
Liberty.</p>
               <p>It is undeniably evident as concerning sin, that though God
cannot be said to ascertain it, because he doth not decree nor
effect it, yet he doth certainly foreknow it, though mans Will
doth freely and contingently determine it self to it. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Scantling of our narrow Apprehensions, and our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Knowledg, is no Rule or Standard whereby we may
confidently determine of the Ways of his Foreknowledge,
whose Understanding is Infinite, Eternal and Unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>It is most certain that God foreknew the Fall of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and of some Angels, which was contingent in it self,
and from no Necessitating Cause, in respect of any Creature,
or any Divine Decree or Operation. And if God hath the
Foreknowledg of one Future Contingent, by the same Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
he hath the Foreknowledg of a World of them.</p>
               <p>In this incomprehensible Divine Foreknowledg, and ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of what is left to the undetermined Liberty of the
Will, there is no repugnancy in Reason; nor do there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
from it any such Inconveniences in Gods Government,

               <head>24. Mans Will doth not that which is more and greater than
what Divine Grace doth, when the Effect is in some
part left to it.</head>
               <p>THere is an Objection, which though somewhat curious,
must be taken notice of. The Act of Repenting and
Believing is something more and greater, than the Ability
or Power to Repent and Believe, and is more conducing to
Salvation. Now though the Power of Repenting and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
be made the Effect of Grace, yet the Acts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are made the Effects of Mans Will, if they be left
in part to the undetermined Liberty thereof. To this it is
answered,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:61568:26"/>
1. Though the Acts of Repenting and Believing be more
and greater, than to have Power to the said Acts; yet to
give the whole Power, which is Gods part, is more and
greater than both the Power, and the consequent Acts. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
though in actual Repenting and Believing a man doth
more to salvation than in having the Power; yet God in
giving the Power, as a total Cause thereof, doth that which
is more and greater in order to Salvation, than Man himself
doth, who receives the Power, and acts according to it.
The Glory and Praise of an Act is infinitely more to be
ascribed to God, who as a total Cause gives the whole Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to do it, than to man that doth it. And so the glory
of Mans Salvation, yea and of his Conversion, is infinitely
more to be ascribed to God than to man.</p>
               <p>2. In the present case, the actual willing to Repent and
Believe, though it be of the Will formally, as its Act, yet
it is of God effectively as his Work. And so in every good
Act, though man be the subject of Willing and Doing, yet
it is God that worketh in man to Will and to Do. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
comprehend what it is for God to work in us to will
and to do, more than to be the total Cause of all that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
by which we will and do. And I do not understand any
other immediate influence of God into the Act it self, than
that which is into the Agent Power.</p>

               <p>Yet when God hath made with men a Conditional Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

doth not thence follow, that it is agreeable to his Wisdom

to per from the Conditions themselves, or to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
mediate Acts tending thereunto, upon performance
whereof more Help comes, till it reach to an immediate Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency.</p>
               <p>Let it be considered, whether it be agreeable to the
Mercy of God declared in the Covenant of Grace, to leave
those, to whom he hath propounded it, under an impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of being saved by it; And whether the Gospel-offer be
an Act of Grace, tending to Salvation, towards those that
are utterly destitute of that necessary Divine Help, without
which their Conversion and Salvation is morally impossible.
An offer of Mercy upon Impossible Terms, one would think
is no Mercy or no Offer.</p>
               <p>If Grace necessary to the acceptance of the Gospel-Offer
be utterly withholden, let it be considered, how the non-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
of that Offer can be a greater sin than the bare

in his abiding in sin, as the Devils now are; but I
cannot see how he had been inexcusable for the neglect of his
Recovery, if he had been utterly destitute of that Necessary

Helps of Grace, infers our Duty of improving them, and our
inexcusableness in the neglect of them; and this seems to
me necessarily to imply, that they are in themselves impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable,
and that we have Power to improve them.</p>
               <p>Every man is culpable in not fulfilling the whole Law,
without the least breach thereof, because the unalterable
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61568:27"/>
Law of God, and the Power that was once given, but now
lost, obligeth him to it: But no man is culpable for not
improving the Help of Grace to that perfect fulfilling of
the Law, because no man hath received a Help Sufficient
thereunto.</p>
               <p>An unconverted person is culpable in not turning to
God, because the Law of God unalterably obligeth him to
cease from sin: But he would not be culpable for non-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of Helps and Means if they be not Improvable,

notes ones not doing not only what he should, but what
he might do, and that he is wanting to himself, when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
necessary is wanting. Nothing is Improvable beyond
its Sufficiency; and Means in themselves Improvable, are not
Improvable with respect to us, if we have no Power of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
them.</p>
               <p>If the case were such, that men shall be condemned for
the Non-Improvement of any Helps external or internal,
when they are destitute of a further Help, without which it
is impossible that they should Improve them, any one would
think that it were better for them to be without those Helps.
And indeed how can they be truly called Helps or Means to

Preventing Grace, yet subordinately it may depend on our
own well-disposedness, which is always the Effect of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Preventing Grace.</p>
               <p>The Indeavours of a man yet unconverted, which are not
accepted of God immediately unto his Justification, may be
accepted according to their degree; namely, unto the bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Benefits tending to Conversion and Justification; and
so may be the Condition of obtaining such Benefits.</p>
               <p>It doth not derogate from the Honour of Divine Grace,
nor tend to beget arrogance in men, that God should ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
give further Grace upon the good use of former Grace.
For it is not the value and worth, but the congruity and
meetness of what is done by man for the receiving of more
Grace, that is here considered. And it is very congruous,
that the acts of Divine Grace towards men should not be
perfected at once, but by degrees, as men make use of the
former degrees.</p>

               <head>32. Equal help of Grace may have different Effects.</head>
               <p>WHere equal Help of Grace is vouchsased to several
Persons, it is possible that the good Act, for which
it is given, may follow in one of them, and not in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And where equal Help is given to the same person
at several times, it is possible that the good act may follow
at one time, and not at another. Otherwise whensoever a
good Act is done, a greater help, than that which is given
when it is not done, is supposed necessary. And if greater
Divine Help, than what is given, be causally necessary to
all those injoyned Acts, which are not done, all sinful omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61568:29"/>
would be ultimately resolved into Gods not giving
what is necessary to the opposite Good Acts; which to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
is, as I suppose, a great inconvenience.</p>
               <p>From this supposition that the same Grace sometimes takes
effect, and sometimes not, it doth not follow that the same
Efficience is not the same. For as the term Efficience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes
the following act, it is not the same Efficience that
doth and that doth not take effect. Yet it may be said
the same Efficience, if the word be taken for the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in <hi>se,</hi> and not respectively with connotation of the
Effect.</p>

               <head>33. Whether any be Converted by such Help of Grace,
as leaves some Vnconverted.</head>
               <p>THat there is Grace sufficient to Conversion which doth
not effect it, hath been already argued. And that
more Grace, than what is immediately sufficient, is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to it, the very terms do make plain. And if it be
not in the nature of the thing necessary, that more be given
than what is immediately sufficient, who can prove that God
doth always give more, where Conversion follows?</p>
               <p>If in several Persons or People receiving Equal Grace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
common Good Acts, the Events have been different as to
that kind of Good, I do not understand why in several
Persons receiving Equal Grace to saving Good Acts, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
may not be different as to that kind of Good. But
indeed I judg, that in this case we are not so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
to know what is done, as what may be done, and
what would be done, if men were not wanting to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>It may seem by our Saviours words, <hi>Mat. 11. 21. If the
mighty works, which have been done in you, had been done in
Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, &amp;c.</hi> That
some would certainly have been converted by that very Help
of Grace, if it had been given them, which did not convert
others, to whom it was given. His upbraiding the People
to whom he spake, as more unyielding to God than others
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61568:30"/>
would have been, doth shew that an Equal Help of Grace
would have converted others; I mean equal in it self; but
whether it might be called equal respectively to their need,
I confess I cannot say. For they might need a greater Help
than others to prevail against their greater aversness. Yet
this may be rationally hence inferred; That in some instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
by that Help of Grace, which is in it self Equal, some
may be, and actually are converted, and not others, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the unequal disposedness of the Persons.</p>
               <p>Whether some be converted, and others not, by that Help
of Grace, which is Equal not only in it self, but also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively
to the need of both, if we know not, there is no
great need to know. But I think it is hard for any to shew
cause why it cannot be so, and that it never is so. In
this Case the undetermined Liberty of the Will sufficeth to
make a diversity of the Cause to a diversity of the Effect
in the several Persons, notwithstanding the same Disposed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
the same Object, the same Helps, the same Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and all other Circumstances the same.</p>
               <p>Howbeit, none are Converted, whose Conversion is not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedently
ascertained of God. For this, if any thing, must
not be left to uncertainty. Here it is to be noted, that the
non-ascertaining of an Event doth not render it impossible.
And the non-ascertaining of Conversion doth imply no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of Non-Conversion, but that which is called <hi>necessitas
consequentiae,</hi> or of Logical Inference, and imports only a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
and no proper Necessity of the thing inferred.</p>
               <p>God doth ascertain Conversion, by the vouchsafement of
such Grace, as doth infallibly produce it, according to his
Foreknowledg and Decree. Gods gracious Efficience, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
from an absolute Decree of the Success, is the <hi>formalis ratio</hi>
of Effectual Grace.</p>

               <p>The undetermined Liberty of the Will, and the different

another?</head>
               <p>WHen one is converted and not another, if there be a
specialty or inequality of Divine Help in any Kind
vouchsafed to the Convert more than to the other,
the Cause of the difference is clear and unquestionable, <hi>viz.</hi>
that special or more abundant Help, whatsoever it be; but
if the Help vouchsafed to both be altogether equal, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
some disquisition to assign the Cause of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
               <p>Here it is to be considered, that difference or dissimilitude
is a Relation, and hath no other Cause than the Cause of
its <hi>fundamentum,</hi> from which it ariseth by bare resultancy.
In the present case, as there be two Subjects, there are two
dissimilitudes, to each whereof there is its proper <hi>fundamentum.</hi>
The Believer differs from the Unbeliever by believing,
that is, his believing is the <hi>fundamentum</hi> of the dissimilitude
on his part. Now of his believing God is the Chief Cause,
and he himself is the Subordinate Cause, totally dependent on
God; and consequently God is the Chief Cause, and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
but the Subordinate Cause of the relation of dissimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
on his side. The Unbeliever differs from the Believer
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61568:31"/>
by Unbelief, that is, unbelief is the <hi>fundamentum</hi> of the dissimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
on his part. Now of his Unbelief he himself is the Chief
Cause, and God is no Cause thereof at all; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he himself is the Chief Cause of the relation of dissimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
on his side, and God is no Cause thereof at all.</p>
               <p>This Solution is not so curious as plain and evident. In
this Case, God giving Equal Help to both, all that can be
said by an Objector, is, That the difference on the Believers
part comes not from Gods different help. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
it is manifest that it comes from his Gracious Help, as
the Chief Cause, upon which Mans Will the subordinate Cause
is wholly dependent; and the praise of this difference must
go accordingly.</p>
               <p>In short, Mans Will is the subject of the difference on
both sides; and on the Believer's side God is the Chief and
man the Subordinate Cause: but on the Unbelievers side
man is Chief, and God is no Cause at all of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
               <p>As for the Apostles words, <hi>Who made thee to differ,</hi> they
may be well thus expounded, <hi>who gave thee that by which thou

               <p>IT is probable that God gives from time to time a more special

the said Help may consist in more thoroughly congruous
Means, and happily concurring Providences, Seasons, and
Circumstances, all which depend on Gods wise disposal of all
for the Salvation of his Elect according to his Eternal Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.

External Means, and all concurring Providences, may be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined
towards several persons, in some of whom the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

always a specialty of Grace towards the Elect, in respect of
the Divine Decree, Gods gracious Purpose of the Saving
Effect is comprehended under the term Grace. The Scripture
mentions <hi>the Election of Grace,</hi> Rom. 11. 5. <hi>Gods purpose and

purpose of him, who worketh all things after the counsel of his own
will,</hi> Eph. 1. 11.</p>
               <p>Whomsoever God saves, he Eternally decreed to save
them. For it is undeniable, that whatsoever God doth in
Time, he Eternally purposed to do the same, and in the
same order. Though the Decree of God, which never fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
doth ascertain the Salvation of the Elect, yet the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of the Decree (as hath been before shewed) is not
the negation of any thing causally necessary to the Event, and
doth not make the Salvation of others impossible, any more
than the negation of his Prescience doth. And God hath
not discouraged any, by telling them they are not Elect: but
he hath put all men upon a fair Tryal in hope.</p>

               <head>38. It becomes God to ascertain the Salvation of some, but

               <p>UPon the great performance of Christ in the Redemption
of the World, that some should be saved is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
congruous to the Divine Wisdom and Goodness; and
thereupon that he hath Eternally Purposed the salvation of
some, is as evident. He hath indeed Eternally Willed all the
Good that comes to pass, and therefore more especially the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of them that are saved. It is also evident, that
according to that Purpose, he doth ascertain their Salvation
by such an Operation of Grace towards them, as shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
effect it, whatsoever degree of Free Agency under
Divine Grace they themselves have about it.</p>
               <p>From how absolute a Decree soever the salvation of the
Elect doth proceed, yet it is effected no other way in those
that have the use of Reason, than upon their performing the
Conditions of the Covenant of Grace. Though the Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
of the Elect be absolutely decreed (I mean abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely

yet this Crowning Gift is received upon condition of
their care and diligence, both to prevent their Falls and Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slidings,
and when they have faln, or slidden back, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
themselves.</p>
               <p>But the Wisdom and Goodness of God doth not lead him
to ascertain the Salvation of all. It sufficeth that his Goodness
hath made all men Salvable; but it is very agreeble to his
holy and wise Government of men in a state of tryal, that
there should be various measures of the Gracious Helps and
Means that he affords, and that there should be various E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
and Issues thereof.</p>
               <p>That few comparatively shall be Saved is Christs own as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion,
and that it is so, it is not through any omissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61568:32"/>
of those, to whom the Gospel is published; and to the
rest of the World the Justice of his Grace is not wanting.
They have the Natural Revelation of Gods Reconcileable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to Sinners upon their Repentance and Conversion to
him, which, if they were not wanting to themselves, might
