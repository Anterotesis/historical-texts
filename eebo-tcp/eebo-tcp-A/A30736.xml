            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A
SERIOUS ADVICE
TO THE
CITIZENS
OF
LONDON,
By some MINISTERS of
the GOSPEL in the said
CITY:
Upon occasion of the
HORRID MURDER
And
DREADFUL DEATH
OF
NATHANIEL BUTLER,
An high Malefactor</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Beloved in Christ,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AS we thought it a great duty lying upon
us, before the execution of the sentence
of death upon <hi>Nathaniel Butler</hi> to lay out
<pb facs="tcp:103782:2"/>
our selves to the utmost for the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of his spiritual and eternal good; in
frequent praying with him, or for him;
in endevouring to convince him of the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
greatness of his sins, and in spreading
the freeness of the grace of God in Christ
before him, according to the penitential work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
we observed in him. So (having done
our duty to him; (who is dead under the stroke
of justice) and as is hoped with some success
too through the grace of God, for wh<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ch we
bless him) we humbly judge there is a further
duty incumbent upon us, unto you the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of this famous City, who have been
spectators of this Tragedy, in a serious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending
of this providence to you and
the duty which it calls for.</p>
            <p>Psal. 9 16. <hi>The Lord is known by the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which he executeth.</hi> And surely this
latter Age (though an Age full of sin) hath
not set before you a more dreadful instance
of mans sinfulness, and Gods justice (though
in the end sweetned much with mercy) then
that which in and upon this notorious Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fa<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>tor
hath been laid before your observation.
And therefore we cannot here be silent, but
must take this advantage with all humility and
affection to your souls good, plainly to open
our hearts to you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103782:2"/>By some (we know before hand) we shall be
sleighted and censured as men too busy, and
may be, as men too credulous; but in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God we can say, our aim is publick
good and the discharge of our consciences, and
therefore we are not discouraged.</p>
            <p>And we are not wholly without hope, but
that some benefit may be reaped from these
few lines, which here with all sincerity we do
present upon that late providence which hath
been before you. That providence we say,
which like the <hi>Cloud</hi> is on one side very dark,
on the other side bright; very dark as to the
mans sin, but bright as to Gods mercy nnto him,
as is believed.</p>
            <p>Tis the daily and inward grief of our spirits,
God knows it, that our Ministry is so successe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
that we see so little fruit of the word
preached by us, that in a City where there is
such plain and powerful preaching, such horrid
sins should be committed:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is a lamentation and shall be for a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>
But possibly some secure sinners may be a
little startled and awakened by this terrible
judicial hand of God; and so a word setting
in with this providence may be more effectual
then many in an ordinance. We cannot but
comply with the will of God in the use
of all means for the furtherance of your salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb facs="tcp:103782:3"/>
And oh! that God would so bless this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
that you all may <hi>hear and fear and
sin no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching the sad occasion, we will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
upon that: the hainous murder, the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
uncleanness, the wicked theft, of which
<hi>Nat: Butler</hi> was guilty (of the former but once,
which we speak not by way of extenuation;
for that's too much, of the two latter very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten)
as also the shamefulness and dreadfulness
of his death: these we pass over, as being very
well known to all of you, Neither shall we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
our selves in any narrative of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of God upon his heart, during his impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment,
and at his execution; (though here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we could speak much as being (for the most
of us) very often with him in this time, and
narrow observers of him.) Nor shall we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiate
upon some of those great truths of the
Gospel, which this famous instance doth lead
us to; Namely that sometimes it pleases God
in the sovereignty and prerogative of his grace
to ceaze upon the greatest sinners; and out of
the coursest rubbish to erect the monuments of
his unlimited mercy. 1 Tim. 1. 16. The Lord
doth sometimes take the vilest wretches, and
hangs them out as patterns of his infinite love
that the freeness of his grace may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired,
and the greatest of sinners may
be incouraged; but still in the way of
<pb facs="tcp:103782:3"/>
               <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> we do not, we dare
not limit the Grace of God, as to exclude
this Notorious and Bloody sinner from it; nay
we have good hope, that through the infinite
Mercy of the Father, and the All-sufficient Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of the Son, he is accepted to eternal Life.
Indeed, when we consider the horribleness of
his sin, the greatness of his joy, after a short
humiliation (yet deep and through we hope)
we easily conjecture, that some will question
both the prudence of any publication, and the
truth of his Conversion. But we will med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with neither of these, leaving men to jude
of the former, and God alone (who searches and
knows the heart) to judge of the latter.</p>
            <p>Waving therefore all these things, our on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
design and businesse in this application, is to
press upon you (the inhabitants of this City)
to some of whom we are more neerly related
in our respective Charges) the several du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which do naturally result from this Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>We would exhort you in the first place, To
be thankful to God for his Restraining Grace;
which though it be short of his Renewing
Grace, yet tis with all thankfulness to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued:
Oh! bless the Lord, who keeps you
from those sins which this poor Wretch was
guilty of, that you are not Adulterers, Theeves,
<pb facs="tcp:103782:4"/>
nay, Murderers and Malefactors, to be <hi>punished
by the Iudge;</hi> this is the Lords mercy. 1 Cor.
4. <hi>7. Who makes you to differ from others?</hi>
Have not you the same Natures? Have not you
the Seed and Spawn of all wickedness in you?
And should God leave you to the baseness of
your own hellish hearts, would not you also
run to all <hi>Excess</hi> of sin, and that with <hi>Greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
too?</hi> When you read over this sad Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
we beseech you lay your hands upon your
hearts, and say, What a mercy is it, I was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Murderer</hi> nor the <hi>Murdred!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We desire you to mourne over the crying
sins that are to be found amongst us. Oh!
the Scarlet sins that swarm in <hi>London,</hi> even
in <hi>London!</hi> Swearing, Drunkenness, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness,
Profanation of the Lords Day, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the Gospel, and of the Ministry
thereof; nay, even Blood-guiltiness is to be
found amongst us! Should not your Souls, like
the Soul of Righteous <hi>Lot,</hi> be <hi>vexed</hi> within
you for these things, 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 7?</hi> Should you
not all come up to be <hi>Ezekiel's</hi> mourners, in
the remembrance of them, <hi>Ezek. 9. 4?</hi> Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
considering that these things are done in
times of Reformation, and in a place of Vision,
even in <hi>London,</hi> where the Light of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
shines so gloriously; where the Word is
Preached so plentifully and powerfully, even
<pb facs="tcp:103782:4"/>
there these abominations are to be found.
Will you not lay them to heart?</p>
            <p>And what reason have you to admire the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
of God to this <hi>City?</hi> Tis a wonder
<hi>London</hi> is not made as <hi>Sodom,</hi> that desolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
doth not seize upon your houses, that you
are not all swept away with the Bee<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ome of
suddain destruction, that you are not hung up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Gibbet as Spectacles of Gods vengeance
to all the Nations round about! What? so
much provocation, and yet the City to stand!
Oh the Patience and Long-suffering of God!
Doubtless, if God had not a <hi>Romnant</hi> amongst
you, who seek him daily, and fear his Name,
you had been laid desolate long before now.
<hi>Isa.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>We need not from hence to stir you up to
submit to <hi>Government,</hi> and to bless God that
you live in a place where Laws are Executed.
What a <hi>Chaos?</hi> what a Wilderness of wild
Beasts should we be, if Malefactors were not
punished? What Confusion, Cruelty, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barousness,
would overspread all, if by whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Laws, and the care of good Magistrates
in the Execution of them, we had not some
Boundaries set to the Lusts of men? whether
would the heart of man run, if there were not
some reins upon it? Tis sad the Law of God
will not keep men from sin, but seeing it will
<pb facs="tcp:103782:5"/>
not, tis mercy we have the Laws of Man. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
are afraid of the <hi>Gallowes,</hi> which have no
sense of <hi>Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This great Sinner is represented to you as an
eminent instance of the Grace of God, and
so we hope he was. Tis very necessary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
we should here insert a Caveat against
the abusing of this Grace of God. How apt are
we with the Spider to such Poyson, where with
the Bee we should suck Honey? How many
will be apt from hence to encourage themselves
in sin, and to say, <hi>Let us sin, that Grace may
abound,</hi> Rom. 6 1. Or, let us sin, for Grace
will abound. Man is not more prone to any
thing then to catch at eminent Acts of Grace,
and to make that <hi>Fewel</hi> to his <hi>Lust,</hi> which
God intended only to be <hi>Food</hi> to his <hi>Faith.</hi>
And never was there any age wherein there
was more of this Spirit of Presumption, then
this wherein we live; insomuch, that upon
this very account, some of us were very inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to think, That 'twas better to have the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of this man suppressed then published. But
since providence hath so ordered it that it doth
see the Light, we cannot but annex to it an
Antidote against presuming. Sinners, do not
pervert this Grace of God; God lets you
have it, to keep you off from the rock of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair,
not that you should run upon the rock
<pb facs="tcp:103782:5"/>
of presumption. Deut. 29. 19, 20. If you sin
you may have mercy, but if you presume to sin,
can you then expect mercy? Grace rejected
may yet save you (though that will cost you
dear) but oh tremble to abuse the grace of God
to incourage you in sins!</p>
            <p>God sometimes gives some rare instances
of his grace to notorious sinners that none
may <hi>de pair,</hi> but he is very choice in these
that none may <hi>presume.</hi> Tis true, upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
the greatest sinner shall find mercy,
but how do you know, that God will give you
repentance? How many are in the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
that this offender was, that die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any such work upon them? we affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
beseech you and warn you, not to <hi>turn
this grace of God into wantonnesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These things we hint in general; More
particularly we shall address our selves to
you in the several capacities wherein you stand.</p>
            <p>You the <hi>Right honourable Magistrates of
the City,</hi> with all submission, and yet with all
holdness we exhort you to do your duty. Tis
nor enough for you to punish sin when 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you, but you are to endevour the prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, you see what is the sad fruit of <hi>Ale-houses,
Whore-houses,</hi> and such places, we hope
your zeal will yet continue, nay be heightned
in the suppressing of them. Down with them,
<pb facs="tcp:103782:6"/>
Down with them, spare them not; they are
the Divels Shops, and let him have no Free-Trade
amongst us: If you will, none shall
have so many Customers as he. How many
Labourers drink that away at these houses,
which should maintain their wives and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
with bread? How are the youth of this
City debauched at them? where they have
their Gaming, Cheating, Whoring; and
what not? Oh let your Reformation be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
and throughout in this particular! But
herein blessed be God, we have great cause as
wel to commend as quicken the zeal of many.
We heartily wish that those who have power
in the <hi>Suburbs</hi> of the City, would be as active
in the restraining of sin as you are; that those
places and persons which you will not indure
in the City (the naming of which would
foul our pen) might not be held up and
harboured there; otherwise it will be small ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to smother Whores out of one Hive,
when they have another ready to receive them.</p>
            <p>We hear and fear tis too true that Priests
and Jesuites (those Romish Locusts) do swarm
amongst us in the City and Suburbs: We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you for the sake of Jesus Christ, and for
love to the Gospel, to put forth your power to
the utmost for the discovering &amp; suppressing of
them: And the rather, because they and their
<pb facs="tcp:103782:6"/>
party are so bold, as to intrude themselves upon
prisoners condemned to die, to pervert them
from the true Religion, (for this attempt they
were bold to make upon <hi>N. B.</hi> before he was
executed.)</p>
            <p>We should also speak to our selves, and to
our <hi>reverend Brethren</hi> in the Ministry. Doth
not this providence speak something to us?
Should we not from hence be stirred up in our
several congregations, more vigorusly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
sin, and to deter men from sin? Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will sinners go, if we let them alone?
Let our preaching be lively, quick, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
by Gods blessing, it may be a means
to prevent these abominable practises; How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
let's do this and then let our hearers do
what they will, their <hi>blood shall be required at
their own hands.</hi> Ezech. 3. 18, 19. We shall
be free from it. Let us beat down drunkenness.
Adultery, &amp;c. and such scandalous sins; and
while we labour to preach down unbelief, let
us take heed that presumption and gross sins
do not break in upon us with a mighty
breach.</p>
            <p>Should we enlarge upon these things, we
should be tedious. Our principal intendment
was to speak a word to you, the people and
Citizens of the place which we shall dispatch
with all plainness and brevity. And here we
<pb facs="tcp:103782:7"/>
will only take the liberty of advising you in
the Notion of <hi>Governours</hi> and <hi>Governed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You that are <hi>Governours,</hi> (we mean Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
of families) give us leave to set in
with this providence, and to stir you up, to
make more conscience of the Family-duties
and engagements, that lie upon you, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to your children and Servants. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
(if things be not mis-represented) had
there been a consciencious discharge of these
duties in the Family, where this young man
lived, he had never come to this sad end.
But we had rather awaken then censure; Was
not that a brave resolution of <hi>Ioshua? I and
my house will serve the Lord.</hi> Josh. 24. 15.
Gen 18. 9. Can you have a better Evidence
of sincerity towards God, then a faithful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
up to relative and Family-duties? Do
not parents that send up their children to you,
put a great trust into your hands? Are not
their children dearer to them then all their
outward comforts, and shall they miscarry
under you for want of care? Will not their
blood be required at your hands, if they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
through your neglect? will it not be sad
to have children and servanns to rise up in
judgment against you and to bring in evidence
at the great tribunall of Christ? <hi>Lord my
<pb facs="tcp:103782:7"/>
Father never minded me! Lord my master ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
regarded me, I might sin, he never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
me, I might go to hell, it was all one
to him,</hi> will not this be sad? will not this be
sweet to you, when you come to die to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to say, Lord I have <hi>walked in my house
with a perfect heart?</hi> Psal. 101. 2. Have you
no love to religion, to propagate it, and to
provide for it's flourishing when you are dead
and gone? Doth not your neglect of family-duties
make all the endeavours of our godly
magistrates, and of godly ministers to be
ineffectual and frustraineous? God hath put it
into their hearts to do good, but tis but
little, they can do in publick, because you
are so remiss in private. And tis the desire
of our souls to beat down sin but we groan
under the sense of sad disappointment, and
this is one reason of it, <hi>what we do at the
Church is undone by you again in your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies;</hi>
No setting on the word, no pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over the word &amp;c. Oh that these things
might be as so many spurs in your sides,
to quicken you to family-duties.</p>
            <p>Set up prayer in your Families; There's a
curse pronouned upon the Families, that do not
call upon God. The Lord be mercisul
to the thousands of Families in the City,
<pb facs="tcp:103782:8"/>
where there is scarce a prayer by the mast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the family, from yeer to yeer. How
can such hope for the blessing of God to be
upon them, who, though he gives mercy free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
yet <hi>he will be sought</hi> unto for it? Ezek. 36.
37. How can such look for Gods <hi>bounty,</hi> who
deny him his <hi>worship?</hi> Doth not <hi>prayer</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
all your Family-comforts, and sanctifie
all your family-comforts? <hi>Morning</hi> and
<hi>Evening</hi> call upon God; and call in your
servants, let them not want the benefit of
prayer; 'twil be poor to <hi>feed</hi> their bodyes,
and to <hi>starve</hi> their souls. If you <hi>eate</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
by all means <hi>pray</hi> together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Catechize</hi> your children and servants; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
them in the fundamentals of religion;
would you keep them from error in the
Head, from loosness in the life, make
conscience of this duty. How excellent,
how necessary, how profitable is this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and yet how sadly is it neglected, we
may in a great measure blame you for the
many Hereticks, and erroneous persons, with
whom we swarm in these dayes.</p>
            <p>Read and open the Scrptures to them,
but do this with all humility and sobriety, or
else there will be danger. These are the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine,
the Treasury of all knowledge,
able to make you and yours wise <hi>to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:103782:8"/>
Let the <hi>word of Christ dwell richly</hi> in
you; and in all that belong to you</p>
            <p>See that they frequent the <hi>publick Ordinances</hi>
let them follow you to the house of God, not
out of state, but in love to their soules; and
when they are there, see they keep there, that
they do not run out again to <hi>Ale-houses</hi> and
<hi>Taverns</hi> (as too many do, to our grief and
your shame be it spoken) when a publick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
is ended, call them to an account see
what they remember, wherein they profit,
how they relish the word; this is to do good
indeed to their soules.</p>
            <p>Keep them to strict observance of the
<hi>Lords-day;</hi> you will not let them trifle away
your days, then you'l hold them to their work;
Oh! let them not trifle away the Lords day.
Why do your children and servants stand gaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at your doors upon the Sabbath? Call
them in, put them upon, reading wholsom
books, and other exercises which are proper
to the day; be not partakers of their sin.</p>
            <p>What ever liberty you grant them at
other times, hold them to a close sanctification
of the Sabbath. And spend this day with
them, in <hi>prayer, repetition, singing of Psalms;</hi>
This is to make your Families as so many <hi>little
Churches</hi> of Jesus Christ. How little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
do the generality of you make of Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-duty;
<pb facs="tcp:103782:9"/>
we might sadly bemoan this before
the Lord. For your selves you can make that
day which is a day for Physick for the soul,
to be the Day for Physick for the Body; you
cannot spare time all the weeke long, you'l
take it upon the Lords day. And for your
children and servants, let them walk in the
Field, play in the streets, sleep in their beds,
or drink in Taverns. 'tis all one to you! Will
God beare this from you? Certainly, this
will be bitterness in the end.</p>
            <p>Do not indulge your servants in <hi>idleness.</hi>
that is the bane of youth, the Devils in-let to
all temptations.</p>
            <p>An idle person is like tinder that will take
every sparke that falls upon it, let them be
out of imployment, 'tis a thousand to one,
but presently they are in some sin. And yet
those that know how to use their Liberty, let
them have it sometimes for lawful recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations,
but this we leave to your pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>In the pursuit of your own pleasures and
conveniences have a care of your Families;
Many of you go to your Country houses
(we condemne you not for it) but what
becomes of your servants? As <hi>Eliab</hi> said
to <hi>David, with whom have you left
<pb facs="tcp:103782:9"/>
those few sheep in the wildrnesse?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reverend Mr. <hi>Stork</hi> an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher in thi<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> City was wont to make this matter of much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.</note> Whilst
you are in your pleasant gardens gratifying
your selves in your creature-enjoyments, who
takes care of them that are left behind to pray
with them, to instruct them, to see they san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
the Sabbath; the health of some Masters
bodies is the ruine of their servants souls.</p>
            <p>Set them in all things a good example, if
they see you can strain in defrauding others,
they'l easily come to strain in the defrauding
of you; let them see you fear to sin and that
will be an awe upon their spirits against sin.</p>
            <p>Take your Apprentices out of religious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
in the Country; Many of you are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with vexatious servants, you may
thank your selves for it; you take your Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices
by the pound, not by good education,
who will give most, not who will deserve most,
and you smart for it afterwards.</p>
            <p>But how do these Heads swell upon our
hands, though we do but name them! These
are some of the things which we should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to the serious consideration of you, who
are <hi>Governours</hi> of Families; and the Lord
make them useful to you.</p>
            <p>In particular, it is of great use to prevent
much wickedness to look to the keys and doors
of your houses and to have them in your own
custody not in your servants that so an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of sinning may be cut off from those that
<pb facs="tcp:103782:10"/>
seek such occasions as most fit for their pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
designs, keep up Discipline, or rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
it again; How is it fallen in these times,
how is it almost lost amongst us in the City;
The reins which your predecessors held with a
very strict hand, are very loose in yours; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of your servants will do what they list,
and you let them alone; we do very much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the low ebb of Discipline and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and judg that to be one Cause of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
disorders which are among us; we heartily
wish it may be restored in Church, in State, in
Families, if this be wanting, all things run up
to strange confusion.</p>
            <p>A Word to the Youth and <hi>Apprentices</hi> of
this City, and we have done. Oh that you
would hear us now, least you <hi>mourne</hi> at the
last, and say, <hi>How have we hated instruction,
and our hearts despised reproof? And have not
obeyed the voice of our Teachers, nor inclined
our ear to them that instructed us.</hi> This <hi>Great
Offendor</hi> was one of your Rank, had he taken
the advice of Gods Word, his sin had not been
so great, nor his punishment so terrible.
Of all, we fear, our counsel to you will be
the most successless; Youth is rash, inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate,
vain, proud, but sometime or other
you will remember what we say.</p>
            <p>Take heed of <hi>lesser sins.</hi> Little sins will
make way for greater sins; if you sip of sin,
<pb facs="tcp:103782:10"/>
you'l be drunk of it at last. How modest is sin
at first, but when 'tis gratified, it growes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent.
This poor man lately executed,
first he began to game, then to steal,
then to Whore, and then to Murder.</p>
            <p>Be careful of your company: associate with
them that fear God; say unto them that are
vain and wicked, <hi>Depart from us, for we will
keep the Commandments of God,</hi> Psal. 119. 115.
Bad company is the way to corrupt and spoil
you: <hi>Can a man touch pitch, and not be defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Read the Scriptures much; by them you
must stand or fall to all eternity; when we
walk by you in your Shops, we see many have
their Shop-Book in their hands, but few have
the <hi>Bible</hi> in their hands; the Shop-Book is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
but the Bible is shut.</p>
            <p>Entertain high thoughts of Holiness and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men: The froth of your wits runs out too
often in jeering godlinesse; but take heed, tha<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>
not a thing to be dealt withal. Many of you
count sin to be gallantry, and Religion but a
low and disgraceful thing. God convince you
of your folly.</p>
            <p>Frequent Publick Ordinances, especially upon
the Lords day, because you have not opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
so to do upon the week days. You'l find
more comfort in the Word and Prayer<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> then
in all your youthful delights.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103782:11"/>Keep the Sabbath; You have six dayes, let
God have one; can he have lesse? God out
of special respects to servants, hath instituted
and sanctified this day. How can you hope to
keep an everlasting Sabbath in heaven, if this
Sabbath on earth be profaned by you. Many
go to Tiburn lamenting the profanation of the
Lords day, as that which ushered in all their
wickedness.</p>
            <p>Every day spend some time in private pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
'tis but rising a little the earlyer, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to bed a little the later; you shall never be
the worse for that time you spend in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God.</p>
            <p>Be subject and obedient to your Masters;
study how to please them; bear with their
passionate infirmities: <hi>Do not purloyn but shew
all good fidelity, that the doctrine of God our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
may be adorned,</hi> Tit. 2. 9, 10. Be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
in your Callings; if you be idle, Satan
will get an advantage. The sitting bird is easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shot, and the standing water gathers filth.</p>
            <p>Love those that curb you, and restrain you
in wayes of sin; they are your best friends:
'tis better to be held in, then to have a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
liberty; 'tis better to have lust restrained
then satisfied. Be not angry with those who
cannot see you damne your souls, and let you
alone.</p>
            <p>Enter upon the wayes of God betimes, the
<pb facs="tcp:103782:11"/>
sooner the better: Shall the devil have the
best draught, and shall God be put off with
the Lees and Dregs <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12. 1.</p>
            <p>Live alwayes as in Gods sight, and know, if
you sin, God will certainly find you out one
time or other. Alas how many wayes hath
God to bring the most hidden works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to light; sometimes by startling mens
own consciences to an accusation of themselvs,
sometimes by awakening some of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices
to the discovery of the rest. If you sin
together, you shall smart together. Let this
sad example never be forgotten by you for
this: Those that were Confederates in sin,
are made instruments and occasions of misery
each to other. Look not upon sin in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of it, but in the danger of it: The Wine
sparkles in the cup, but 'twill be poyson in the
belly. Fear the strokes of God more then the
stroaks of man What's a fetter, a dungeon, a
gallows to hell fire? Mortifie a spirit of pride
Never such pride amongst the youth of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as now; What vanity in apparel, what su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perciliousness
in carriage, what contempt of
Authority? Oh, <hi>be clothed with humility,</hi> 1 Pet.
5. 5. Give not way to imaginary, speculative
heart sins; Murder in the heart, will soon be
Murder in the hand; uncleanness allowed in the
thoughts, wil come to bodily uncleanness at the
<pb facs="tcp:103782:12"/>
last. Keep Satan at a distance, if he get in, he'l
be too hard for you.</p>
            <p>To sum up all: A dreadful spectacle of Gods
Justice, and of the fruit of sin, hath been lately
set before you, we beseech you in the Bowels
of Iesus Christ, break off from all your sinful
wayes by repentance; <hi>One</hi> is smitten that <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
may fear; He's a warning to you, take heed
lest you be made a warning unto others. If you
would avoid his <hi>end,</hi> walk not in his <hi>sins;</hi> as
secure as you are, if you will allow your selves
in that which is evil, you do not know whither
the divel wil carry you in a way of sin, or to
what God will bring you in a way of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>Stand in aw therefore and sin not. Flee
youthful lusts,</hi> Ps. 4. 4. 2 Tim. 2. 22. <hi>Let him that
thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fal,</hi> 1 Cor
10. 12. Every day pray that God will keep you
from and strengthen you against temptation:
Say not, 'tis not possible I should ever be so vile
as this Malefactor was; Alas, if God leave you
you'l be as bad as he. <hi>Blessed is the man that
feareth alwayes.</hi> Prov. 28. 14. In all things so
carry your selves according to the rule of the
Word, that you may neither fall into the
hands of men, nor into the hands of God, which
is far the most dreadful. <hi>'Tis a fearful thing to
fal into the hands of the living God.</hi> Heb. 10. 31.</p>
