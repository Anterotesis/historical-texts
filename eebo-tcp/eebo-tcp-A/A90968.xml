         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Mr <hi>Calamy,</hi> who are thoſe <hi>men raiſed up from the Dunghill in
theſe riſing times, who doe govern the Kingdome almoſt?</hi> Either they
muſt be the Parliament or the Army? A man would preſume
you more richly furniſhed with noble principles of civility and

<hi>baſeneſſe</hi> either upon the one or the other; the Parliament being
the onely viſible authority of the kingdome; and the Army

like the point of the Diall to the time of the day, directs our
thoughts to the men of your meaning, <hi>viz.</hi> the ARMY: <hi>Are
theſe men raiſed up from the dunghill who doe governe the Kingdom al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt?</hi>
If ſo, firſt, what mean you by DUNGHILL MEN?
Secondly, what by their <hi>governing the kingdome almoſt?</hi> Do you
mean men of <hi>baſe,</hi> that is, of mean and low bird? your phraſe
(<hi>raiſed up from the Dunghill</hi>) doth intimate ſo much; if it be ſo,
this is no new thing under the Sunne, Was it not but as yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
when BASE MEN intiruling themſelves of the Tribe

Injunctions, ready to lick the duſt at their feet by conformity

King, and ſit in the Throne, though it made its way through
the blood and miſery of Parliament and people, ſhaking the
peace of the kingdome, and removing its foundations out of
their places. And hence it is, that (like <hi>Abſoloms</hi> ſnares of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing

we are ſo early ſolicited morning after morning, with bitter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives

            </p>
            <p>But ſecondly, by <hi>men from the Dunghill,</hi> doe you mean men of

               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:115439:6"/>
And yet upon the wonderfull turne of the times, ejection of
Epiſcopacy and advance of Presbytery, did preſently and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

and not ſuch a notorious conformitant unto, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
ſtickler for the Prelats fooleries in the county of <hi>Suffolke</hi> in

that ſuch a man once truly touched with the divine ſence of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
vanities, could hardly, if ever, be bitter and rigid againſt his
brethren for non-conformity to unknown Presbytery? Did not

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uſe conformity to ſuch idle vanities,
chuſing rather to ſuffer afflictions with the people of God, than
to enjoy the benefit of ſuch conformity with the troubles of
their conſciences for a ſeaſon; may we not thereby clearly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that unlearned men of low parts and cognizance in the
things of the Goſpel, may ſee into ſome things of that nature,
which learned men, yea Miniſters themſelves of no ſmall name

which may be a continuall bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and bridle in the lips of thoſe
who are calling for fire from heaven, and the ſword of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
to ſuppreſſe and moleſt their conſcientious brethren for
their non-conformity to their judgement in Eccleſiaſticall diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.
For may not he that was ignorant of the will of God in
the times of Epiſcopacie, be juſtly ſuſpected for weakneſſe and
miſtakes about his moſt perfect will in the dayes of Presbytery,
eſpecially when the moſt pious, godly, and learned men of the
kingdom, have engaged themſelves with all their might for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
yeares together, to find out the will of God herein, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
come at it.</p>
            <p>If Mr. <hi>Calamies</hi> old conformitie to Epiſcopall ceremonies,
was at that time againſt the light of his judgement and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
though we will not ſay ſuch an one is a <hi>Dunghill-man,</hi> but
Chriſtianly allow for the manifold temptations which may ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize

and Mr <hi>Calamy</hi> by his former conformity; yet Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
if truly touch'd with the feeling of his former infirmities, and
graciouſly ſenſible of the mercy obtain'd (would he but ſuffer the
conſideration hereof to work genuinely and naturally in him)
is the moſt competent Judge to accuſe, arraigne, and ſentence
himſelfe for his former vanity, and not inveigh againſt, abuſe
and traduce his brethren for Heretickes, Sectaries, Schiſmaticks,
according to the example of the Doctors of the Prelacie, for
non-conformity to his new Presbytery: For can we beleeve, that
that ſpirit which made <hi>Peter</hi> to weep for denying his Maſter, and
<hi>Paul</hi> to judge and ſentence himſelfe for perſecuting the Church,
and his old conformity to the Scribes and Phariſees; will ſuffer
Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi> to run a contrary courſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to vex and gall his
weak brethren for their preſent refuſall to Presbyterian ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Was Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi> a man, and therefore fallible in the
times of Epiſcopacy, And is he a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
the ſame time? or as <hi>Judas</hi> did with Chriſt, to pretend a kiſſe,
and to betray them into the rage, malice, contempt and ſcorn of
the people at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, what meane you by <hi>governing the Kingdome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt?</hi>
Is it in plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> thus, The Army governes the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

Doe you ſuppoſe that we can be ſo dim-ſighted, or ſo dull-hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,

the mercy, candor, and goodneſſe of the Parliament, will
prove the utter ruine of them and their families who were ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

Secondly, who are the <hi>HYPOCRITES?</hi> Mr. <hi>Cautons</hi> doctrine

            <p>Thirdly, what is it for the Innocent to ſet themſelves againſt the

away our good members the Speakers and others from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

Firſt of all, the diviſions between a good part of the formerly

Sermons do alter and change; one while we find them all for mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
&amp; Chriſtian accommodation, and forbearance one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
another while all for reformation againe, that is, Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in the rigid ſenſe thereof, that is, that all power may be in the
Miniſters hands, and the Magiſtrates engaged to put their Orders
and Edicts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wills and pleaſures into execution, one while pleading
for and preſſing the ſetting up the government of Chriſt in the
hearts of men, minding men to be zealous for the great things of
the Goſpel, faith and repentance, and love amongſt brethren, and
not thus to contend ſo ſtrenuouſly for the mint and cummin, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
and Government, &amp;c. Another while calling with might &amp;
main for Reformation, Reformation, putting the Crown upon the
head of Chriſt, and the Scepter into his hands, pleading for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Jeſus Chriſt, that is, the exalting of themſelves above
their brethren.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, our jealouſie that <hi>Sion Colledge</hi> is ſtill that root of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe
that fills our pulpits with ſuch bitter cluſters from day to
day, is further ſtrengthened by this, that we do obſerve thoſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
which before they came to the Citie, before they <hi>walked in the
counſell of Sion Colledge, ſtood in their wayes,</hi> and <hi>ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<hi>their ſoules did enter into their ſecrets,</hi> they were men of calme,
quiet, meek, ſweet and precious ſpirits; but as we have heard of
ſome kind of wormes, if brought into ſome aire, are thereby turned
into Serpents, ſo theſe very men once admitted into the aſſembly
of <hi>Sion Colledge,</hi> are very commonly turned into moſt venemous,
ſerpentine and bitter ſpirits, changing their very genius and candid
nature and diſpoſition, to the very amazement and admiration of
thoſe that knew them, differing as much from their former cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes
and behaviour (as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> did when he loſt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and noble principles of a man of honour and greatneſſe, and
had in the roome of it the nature of a wilde beaſt, whoſe nailes
grew like talons, which he improved doubtleſſe in procuring and
devouring his prey) we could give inſtances in ſeverall men of our
own knowledge, who are no more like the men that formerly they
were, than <hi>Hazael</hi> when he did ſet the ſtrong holds of Iſrael on
fire, deſtroyed their young men with the ſword, daſhed childrens
braines againſt the ſtones, and ript up womens bellies great with
child, was like himſelfe when he ſaid unto the Prophet who told

               <hi>him he ſhould commit theſe cruelties,</hi> Is thy ſervant a dogge that bee

            <p>Fourthly and laſtly, another ground of our jealouſie that <hi>Sion
Colledge</hi> is ſtill the womb of all theſe illegitimate and unchriſtian,
peeviſh, froward, perverſe and bitter paſſages that we meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
in pulpit from morning to morning, and from day to day, from
the lips of <hi>Sion Colledge</hi> men, is the changing of their countenance
towards ſome of their members, that at laſt recover themſelves
from out of that ſnare of death, a froward heart and a perverſe
tongue againſt their brethren. When any Miniſter ſits among
them obſerving their order, and feeling their ſpirits, but cannot
approve of their bitter proceedings againſt their diſſenting bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
or if any (formerly overtaken with the guilded ſpecies of
their zeal for God and Jeſus Chriſt, a reformation of ordinances,
&amp;c. that joyned with them) upon a due and experimental percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their deceitfull guiles, and crafty wiles, promoting little
more than their owne intereſt under the glorious pretence of a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
reformation, who cannot act in pulpit according to the [ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed]
reſolves of <hi>Sion Aſſembly;</hi> what an ill aſpect is caſt upon

City, preach for moderation, peace, gentleneſſe, goodneſſe, forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,

at leaſt, if not to conclude, that <hi>Sion Colledge</hi> is <hi>Londons,</hi> nay <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>
diſtemper: for doe we not perceive that this great Wheel ſets
the Citie and Countrey in motion; is not this the method (as the
Apoſtle ſpeaks of luſt when it is conceived bringeth forth ſin, and
ſin when it is perfected, bringeth forth death) even ſo I doe not
ſelfe-love, and ſelfe-intereſt, honour and greatneſſe, fomented,

men, &amp;c. and <hi>publickly</hi> in Pulpit and Preſſe, ſtirring up the
people, by all poſſible meanes, under the pretence of the glory of
God, a bleſſed reformation, the keeping of the covenant, the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of error, blaſphemy, hereſie, &amp;c. to ſet us all together by

it: for who pleads more for the City-Remonſtrance than the
members thereof? which of them declaimes againſt that rebellious
force made upon the Houſe? We heare enough of rebellion fixed
elſe-where, though all their Logick cannot make it good? Who
promoted the raiſing up of a new warre? Did not they read a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
in the Churches to little leſſe purpoſe, when the Army
was coming towards the citie? Did not theſe men in their ſeveral
places (at leaſt divers of them) ſtirre up the people to withſtand the
Army, and to this day declaim againſt the citie for not ſtanding up
at that time, but gave in, and would not ſtand to the cauſe of God,
as they are pleaſed to call it, complaining ever ſince in their prayers,
that the citie is become deſolate, ſhe that was great among the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and a Princeſſe among the provinces, is now become ſolitary

                  <hi>Reply</hi> 1. How often have you taught us that theſe are the acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,
not the naturall products of Chriſts coming into the world?
was not the proper end of his coming to furniſh his Miniſters with
the ſubject matter of their Commiſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> a meſſage of <hi>peace,</hi> that
they may ſay to every Countrey, every Citie, every man, peace be to
this Countrey, this Citie, this man, if they know not, or minde not,
or acknowledge not the things that belong unto their peace; if they
will not receive a meſſage of peace, but ſtand it out to the utmoſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God, their bloud is upon their own heads; have not you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
told us thus?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Did Chriſt come into the world, to put a ſword into
the hands of his converted ones, to kill and deſtroy the unconverted,
or the contrary? Did he come into the world to make wolves or
ſheep, leopards or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or ſave men from deſtruction?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Did Chriſt come into the world to ſend a ſword among
brethren, that they may be digging one anothers bowels, cutting one
anothers throats, bite, devour, and conſume one another? what mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
Text-men are theſe to take the minde and meaning of Satan,
and faſten it upon the words of God? may not truth juſtly complain
of theſe men, as <hi>David</hi> in the like caſe, they wreſt or torture my words
daily, intending to doe me miſchiefe? doth not the Apoſtle bid us
mark ſuch which cauſe diviſions, and tels us that ſuch, how ever they
pretend, ſerve not our Lord Jeſus, but their own bellies, and by good
words and faire ſpeeches, deceive the hearts of the ſimple? and is not
the conſent to divide the childe, an argument of no naturall relation
to the childe, the trick of a ſtrange woman, and not of a naturall
mother? Wee meet yet with your main Objection, with which you
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115439:14"/>
alwayes flouriſh, as if that like the ſword of <hi>Saul,</hi> or bow of <hi>Jonathan,</hi>
did never returne emptie: and when that you have ſpent your ſelves
by ſearching up and down the Scriptures for ſome grounds to juſtifie
your unbrotherly proceedings in bitterneſſe againſt your brethren;
fiſhing night and day, and catching nothing to relieve you in this
poynt, at laſt you take up the Covenant, the ſolemne League and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
that bleſſed Covenant, and make ſuch a noiſe with the word

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r,</hi> as if no man could pronounce it but your ſelves; you man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
this after ſuch a manner, as that if the word of God cannot help
you, yet the Covenant will; if principles of civility, morality, will
not help you, the Covenant will; if Orders, Votes, and Ordinances
of Parliament cannot help you, yet the Covenant will; as if the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
did ſay unto you, as <hi>Peter</hi> did unto Chriſt, Though all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
you, though Scripture, and reaſon, and argument, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of common honeſty forſake you, yet will not I; but alas, if you
will but a little throughly examine the Covenant, with a very few
Queries, as the maid examined <hi>Peter,</hi> the Covenant it ſelfe will be
ready to proteſt that how ever it might be indeed with ſome of the
thoughts of thoſe that did promote the Covenant at the beginning,
yet in true conſtruction and intent, it never knew any ſuch meanings
as you are pleaſed to put upon it; but if truly and throughly exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
it will prove as <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

will not curſe them but bleſſe them altogether; for what can you find
in this Covenant, either feeding or juſtifying that ſpirit of bitternes,
wherewith you are poſſeſt againſt your brethren; is there any one
word, jod, or tittle of Presbytery in any Article, line or letter of the
Covenant? Is there any one word that looks towards ſuch a thing,
as a rigid, fierce, biting, devouring, perſecuting Presbytery? All that
poſſibly you can plead for out of the Covenant to your purpoſe, is it
not contained in the firſt Article? and what is that?</p>

                  </gap>ell in the midſt of us.</p>
               <p>Firſt, What is here for Presbytery? eſpecially a vexatious Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery?
a briery, thorny, perſecuting Presbytery? Wee have engaged our
ſelves for the preſervation of the Reformed Religion in the Church
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline, and government, doth
that juſtifie your railing againſt your brethren, and your charging
the Parliament with Covenant-breaking, as Mr. <hi>Cawton,</hi> and that
peremptory Mr. <hi>Jenkins</hi> have done in expreſſe termes? What an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
is this upon our brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as if the Doctrine, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
Diſcipline, and Government of our brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> were
conſtituted, framed, and calculated for the Meridian of wilde beaſts
of the Deſert, for <hi>Gim</hi> and <hi>Ogim,</hi> owles and ſatyres, dragons and vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that live and prey upon their fellow-creatures, and not for the
ſonnes of <hi>Sion</hi> who are the children of peace? Doe you repreſent the
Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline, and Government of our brethren of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> in ſuch horrid black and bloudy colours, as ſuch a taking
object unto the ſonnes of <hi>England,</hi> if the Cannons, and Laws, Edicts,
and Orders, Statutes and Ordinances of the Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline

and rage, ſlander and abuſe Magiſtrates or Miniſters, Parliament or
people, that will not act according to the fiery fierce and furious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
of peeviſh, froward, and angry ſpirits, ſuch Doctrine, Worſhip,
Diſcipline and Government, doth more become the American Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quids,
Cannibals, or Men eaters in <hi>New-England,</hi> than thoſe that
have heard of a Goſpel of peace, or the leaſt ſound of that ſweet
Commandement of Jeſus Chriſt our liege Lord, who hath ſaid;
<hi>This is my Commandement that yee love one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Are not Presbyterians by this Covenant as well
bound to hearken to the counſels of their diſſenting brethren, as
their diſſenting brethren to hearken to their counſels? and is not
<hi>Scotland</hi> as well engaged to liſten to the advice of <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>England</hi>
to <hi>Scotland?</hi> For are not all of them to make <hi>THE WORD OF
GOD, AND THE EXAMPLE OF THE BEST REFORMED
CHURCHES</hi> (whoſe walking muſt be judged by their conformity
to the <hi>Word of God</hi>) the golden Standard to meaſure them by?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:115439:15"/>
Thirdly, who muſt judge and determine the meaning of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant?
Presbytery is not in the letter of the covenant, and we hope
(though we doe not in the leaſt implead a holy, godly, peacefull and
pious Presbytery, but doe wait and hope for the eſtabliſhment
of it in all our Congregations in the Kingdome) that ſuch a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
as ſeems now to be contended for, will never be found to be the
meaning of thoſe that impoſed the covenant. Shall the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>England</hi> enjoyn a Covenant upon the people, and <hi>Sion Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
in <hi>London</hi> give, nay command or conjure ſuch a meaning into
it as was never intended; what is this but to put <hi>Sion Colledge</hi> above
the Parliament of <hi>England?</hi> The Parliament of <hi>England</hi> commands
the Kingdome to take the Covenant, and <hi>Sion Colledge</hi> (upon the
matter) commands the Parliament to ſubject themſelves unto their
interpretation thereof, upon pain of being arraigned in their Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits
for Covenant-breakers, forſakers of their firſt love, yea and of
vilifying, ſcorning and abuſing them in the eyes of the people, ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
up a ſpirit of contempt in the people againſt them, as many of
you have done from day to day.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, what is ſuch an interpretation of the covenant, but a
meere prophaning of the covenant it ſelfe? Does the covenant ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liege
us to raile and rage, revile and abuſe men that are holy, learned,
godly, peaceable, uſefull in Church and common-wealth, to brand
them with the odious names of Heretickes, Separatiſts, Schiſmaticks,
&amp;c. who cannot ſubject themſelves (we ſay not to the covenant, for
they took it, yea defended the taking of it; yea, ſtirred up their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
to take it in its true, proper, naturall, genuine, and literall
meaning of it) but unto ſuch a ſenſe, meaning, and interpretation
as will ſerve onely to drive on the deſignes of the faction of <hi>Sion
Colledge:</hi> for moſt confident we are, there is at this day no faction
in the Kingdome more dangerous and obnoxious unto the peace,
proſperity, and welfare of the Parliament, Army, and conſequently
whole Kingdome, THAN SION COLLEDGE IS. What

chantings) under the colour of zeale for the glory of God, a bleſſed
ref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rmation, and we know not what, as that they are ready upon

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inous inſurrections againſt the
Parliament and Army; what is this but to abuſe and prophane the
innocent Covenant, which intended union, peace, love, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
amongſt brethren, and the banding them together as one man
againſt the common enemy. Doubtleſſe the true naturall ſoule and
ſpirit of the Covenant, was Union, and not diviſion amongſt bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:
But when men force that ſoule out of the Covenant (we
mean that meaning of the covenant which is naturall) and poſſeſſe it
with a contrary ſpirit or meaning, though it pretends zeale for God,
and a bleſt reformation, &amp;c. yet this is to repreſent the covenant like
<hi>Samuels</hi> body without his naturall ſoule, poſſeſſed with the ſpirit of
Satan, ſpeaking indeed like <hi>Samuel,</hi> but with a wicked and Satanicall
deſigne; what is this but to make the covenant not like an Angel of
God, a meſſenger of peace and union among brethren, but a very
Fury from beneath, furniſhing men with fire-brands to hurle and
throw each againſt other, to the danger of fiering and enflaming the
whole kingdome. You complain of contempt of the covenant, that
it is looked upon as an <hi>Almanack out of date, &amp;c.</hi> and moſt confident
we are, that no pretenders to the covenant under heaven, have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the covenant more vile, baſe and contemptible, than your
ſelves have done, by the interpretation, ſenſe &amp; meaning which you
have put into it. But the truth is, it is no great marvell that you make
the covenant ſpeak what you pleaſe for your own deſignes, ſince you
make (or at leaſt ſtrive to make) the holy Scriptures themſelves,
whoſe naturall juice is milk and honey, to yeeld forth gall, yea blood
it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, who are they which truly and properly break the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant?
Either thoſe that act contrary to the very letter of it, or thoſe
that deny to ſubject themſelves unto that illegitimate and forc'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115439:16"/>
which <hi>Sion Colledge</hi> men put upon it; ſurely they are the
covenant-breakers who act contrary to the letter and moſt naturall
literall and obvious meaning of it: If ſo, let us examine each
Article of the Covenant, and compare it with the practice of <hi>Sion
Colledge</hi> men, and let indifferent men judge who breake the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Article we ſweare, with hands lifted up to the moſt
high God, to <hi>endeavour in our ſeverall places and callings, the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the reformed Religion in the Church of Scotland in Doctrine, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,

withall, that there is no Article, word or ſyllable in the
covenant engaging againſt the toleration of ſuch a man; and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
letter of the covenant binds us unto ſuch endeavours for unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
that brethren may live together as brethren in faith and love,
that the Lord may delight to dwell in the midſt of them. We know
it will be replied, that we are tied in the very letter of the covenant,
unto <hi>unity</hi> and <hi>uniformity</hi> in the three kingdoms, which is inconſiſtent
with a toleration of <hi>Independents,</hi> or any other way whatſoever that
is againſt the received way of the authority of the Kingdomes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
therefore an abſolute breach of covenant, which we muſt not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

ſuffer for our faithfulneſſe to Jeſus Chriſt, holding faſt the profeſſion
of our faith under his tyranny, than be actuall breakers of our cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

               <p>Firſt, if we had promiſed abſolutely to be uniforme in the three
Kingdoms, except we had attained to a moſt certain infallible know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the mind of God herein, we had ſinned by ſuch an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;

and judgement,</hi> and by conſequence were not bound to keep ſuch
a covenant, every man being bound to forſake, and not to continue
in a ſinfull engagement.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ABSOLUTE uniformity in <hi>Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
and Government in the three Kingdomes,</hi> is not our covenant, but
our <hi>ENDEAVOURS</hi> after ſuch an uniformity is our-covenant;
and doubtleſſe we are all bound by all juſt wayes in our ſeverall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and callings to <hi>endeavour</hi> the ſame.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, our Covenant hath tied us to order, manage, &amp; frame our
<hi>endeavours</hi> ſo, <hi>as that brethren may live together in faith and love:</hi> all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>endeavours</hi> directly hindering this bleſſed iſſue, is againſt the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe

               <p>Fourthly, that not an abſolute uniformity, but a Chriſtian, loving
and bortherly <hi>endeavour</hi> was (not onely the expreſſe letter, but alſo)
the intent of the covenant, appeares both by the perſons that made
the covenant, whom we all know not perfectly agreed at that time
about a certain way of Church-government, calling the Aſſembly of

               <p>Secondly, Conſider the miſerable conſequences of disbanding the
Army: is not the Army the walls and bulwarks of the Parliament?
if you disband the one, you ſhall ſee them that will quickly diſſolve
the other, and then the miſerable conſequences of the Parliaments
diſſolution, would be the ſame of the Armies disbanding; hath not
God been a front guard, and a rere-ward unto this Army? hath he
not made it his battle-axe and weapons of warre? hath he not made
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115439:24"/>
it like a new ſharp thraſhing inſtrument having teeth? hath he not
made the mountains plains before theſe <hi>Zerubbabels?</hi> hath he not
made the mountains to skip like rams, and the little hils like young
ſheep, before the preſence of God in this Army? hath he not riſen
up againſt them that have oppoſed them? hath he not honoured
them in the face of the people? and have not you endeavoured to
caſt reproach and ſcorne upon them, making them the baſeſt, vileſt,
moſt blaſphemous, hereticall, erroneous, plundering, oppreſſing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
that ever marcht into the field? have not Gods dealings &amp; yours
towards this Army been like the conteſt between <hi>Michael</hi> and Satan
about the body of <hi>Moſes?</hi> hath not God plainly and evidently ſet
himſelfe in direct oppoſition unto you about this Army, he honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them, you diſhonouring them, he cauſing a ſpirit of glory, you
a ſpirit of ſhame to reſt upon them; did not you propheſie bitter
things of this Army, if the Citie would permit them to march
through, and did not God make you all deceivers, and falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
in the eyes of all men? they marching through the Citie with
weapons in their hands, at ſuch a time when profeſt reſolutions and
endeavours were uſed through your means to raiſe up an Army to
cut their throats, yea, when a ſpirit of feare and trembling took
hold upon their enemies, having all advantages put in their hands
to avenge themſelves for all the wrongs and injuries that were offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them, and yet did they not march peaceably and quietly through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the City, not offering the leaſt wrong to man, woman, nor child,
to their honour, and your ſhame?</p>
               <p>Againe, what had been the iſſue of that horrid inſurrection, made
the ninth &amp; tenth of <hi>Aprill,</hi>

ſome part of this Army ſuppreſt the ſame, (the influence of your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
ſo prevailing with men, that not one of many would appeare
to reſcue the Governours and Government of the Citie from the
ſonnes of violence) and yet did not theſe contemptible Army-men
put their lives in their hands, and preſerved the whole Citie from
the woefull conſequences of that rebellious inſurrection, yea, when
brick-bats and ſtones were caſt out of houſes, and ſome of them were
ſhot out of windows; which affronts had they been offered unto
ſome Armies, would have rendered the Citie in aſhes, but they
would have had ſatisfaction, and yet, as if they were men in valour,
and children in malice: having reſcued the Citie, departed in peace,
bleſſing and praiſing God, that he had made them able to render
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115439:24"/>
good for evill; and doe not all reaſonable men clearly perceive,
that if <hi>Sampſon</hi>-like you lay your hands upon Parliament and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
to diſſolve the one, and disband the other, you take hold of the
pillars of the kingdome, which being removed, you bring all into
confuſion, ruine and miſery, and pull down deſtruction upon your
own heads.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, conſider, the moſt probable, if not certain conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the ſuppreſſion and extirpation of your diſſenting brethren,
were all your diſſenting brethren ſuppreſt, and not one remained,
but onely your ſelves and the Prelaticall party in the kingdome,
doe but ſeriouſly conſider what a through, a bleſſed, a perfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
you would be like to carry on. Suppoſe the diſſolution
of the Parliament, the disbanding of the Army, the deſtruction,
baniſhment or impriſonment of your diſſenting brethren, doe not
you thinke that the malignant and Prelaticall party would not
joyn together with you to ſet up Presbytery in a pious, pure, ſtrict
and godly way? May not we ſay of ſuch among you, that ſhall
think ſo, or acteth as if they did think ſo, as the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi>
ſaith, <hi>The Prophet is a foole, and the ſpirituall man is mad.</hi> In ſhort,
you muſt both unite and live, or both divide and periſh, chuſe you

weary and worry one another, but the reſolve of all muſt be
one of theſe two, either agree and live, or elſe ſtrive thus, and fall
both together.</p>
               <p>Firſt, conſider what faith the one party which the other may not
ſay: You ſay of the <hi>Independent</hi> party, Theſe are the troublers of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> the hinderers of reformation, the diſturbers of our peace, the
incendiaries of the times, the Covenant breakers; and they ſay the
like of you, and both of you argue it each againſt other in the eyes
of the world; but were it not better that both of you did joyn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in joynt promotion and joynt oppoſition of ſuch things
as were according to your joynt opinion, you both profeſſe your
hatred of known ſinne and wickedneſſe, the prophaning the Lords

and looſneſſe; you both profeſſe it your duties to promote
the glory of God, the name of Jeſus Chriſt, the fruits of the Spirit,
the obedience of faith, the workes of repentance, love, meekneſſe,
gentleneſſe, patience, brotherly kindneſſe, mercy, bounty: Did
both parties joyn together in the propagation of thoſe things
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:115439:25"/>
which were according to both your judgements, how quickly
would your differences be reconciled, did both parties ſeeke the
things of Chriſt, and each others good? how quickly might you
both rejoyce each in other, and bleſſe God each for other?</p>
               <p>Secondly, conſider the things wherien you agree, and wherein

the other? Is the one for the ſuppreſſion of error, herefie, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,

this ſuppreſſion, the one affirming it muſt be done by the Magiſtrate,

blaſphemies, directly repugnant with the light of nature, the peace

ought to puniſh ſuch things; but for thoſe errors and miſtakes in
matters of religion, which cannot be rectified but by a ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
illumination, and work of the Spirit; that theſe are to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
by argument, reaſoning, and debates out of the word of truth,
as the onely meanes ſanctified by God for the pulling downe of all
ſuch imaginations that exalt themſelves againſt the knowledge of
Jeſus Chriſt; nay, in the very argument of Church government,
the difference is not ſo vaſt &amp; great as ſeems to be by theſe unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
miſcarriages towards one another. Are you for a Presbytery,
that is, the government of the Church by Paſtors, Elders, Helpers?
ſo are they. Are you for the admiſsion of none but godly perſons
in the eye of charity, into theſe ſocieties? ſo are they. Are you for
combination of Churches? they are for aſſociation. Are you for
ſubordination of one Church to many? they are for a brotherly
and Chriſtian reference of one unto more. Are you for an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative

to another? Are you for excommunication of ſuch Churches as do
not reclaim after admonition, exhortation, reprehenſion, &amp;c. for
error, hereſie, blaſphemy, or evill of doctrine or converſation,
though they are not for excommunication of Churches, yet they
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115439:25"/>
are for non-communion with Churches in ſuch caſes, &amp;c? Why
ſhould there be ſuch an irreconcileable diſtance betweene one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, conſider there have ever been greater differences in the
Churches of God than theſe are: you very well know, that among
the Churches in the Apoſtles dayes, there were differences about
Circumciſion and keeping the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> about the Doctrine
of the reſurrection, about eating meats offered up to Idols, &amp;c. and
the like in after times; and though it be granted that there ſhould
be no allowance of any evill whatſoever, yet th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that faith and love, and the unity of the Spirit was ſtill preſerved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them; and were they not meet and fit examples unto us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whom the ends of the world are come?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, what do you complain of whereof you have juſt cauſe,
and which is not in your power to reclaim?</p>
               <p>Firſt, you complain of your miſery, bondage and ſlavery, of
oppreſſions, ſorrowes and troubles of the Church: that is, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,

you? what troubleth you? who doth oppreſſe you? Have you
not authority on your ſide? Have you not all the Church livings

Ordinance upon Ordinance, Order upon Order, for to back you?
Is there the leaſt ſhew of oppreſſion, ſorrow, or cauſe of complaint
adminiſtred unto you, except it be becauſe you are not ſuffered to

you feed upon nothing but blood, yea the blood of your

that ſearcheth your hearts, whether you are the men whom we thus

be thus as we have ſaid; that it is Gods glory, not any mans ruine,
the blood of errors, hereſie, blaſphemy, prophaneneſſe, &amp;c. that you
ſeek after, not the blood of men; the building of Gods houſe, not
the pulling down of any mens houſes; the ſetting up of <hi>Chriſt</hi> on the

that they were factious, ſeditions, hereticks, ſectaries, ſchiſmaticks?
and doe not Presbyterians call thoſe whom they would baniſh, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon,

               <p>Secondly, Doe you complaine, that the Miniſtery is deſpiſed?
Why doe you make your ſelven deſpicable? Can ſober diſengaged
men alwayes honour thoſe that leave preaching of Chriſt (the life

to offer 185 arguments to maintain an error, and to give teſtimony
to it, when 185 Miniſters of <hi>London, Lancaſhire,</hi> and <hi>Warwick-ſhire,</hi>
give teſtimony indeed to the truth of Jeſus, by aſſerting ſuch and ſuch
things for truth, and by calling ſuch and ſuch things errors, hereſies,

had we more of your pains, and leſſe of your paſſions, more of your

Error is ſeated in the imaginations of men, and they are high

demolliſh ſtrong reaſonings; the weight of the little finger of
truth and ſound reaſon doth more effectually cruſh error, hereſie,

argument coming againſt error in the name and according to the
will of God, will be unto an whole hoſt of errors, as the Angel of
God unto the hoſt of <hi>Senacherib,</hi> viz. ſcatter and ſlaughter them,
that the place thereof ſhall not be found any more; one ſound argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from the holy Scriptures wiſely and skilfully managed againſt

viz.</hi> ſtrike it dead in the face of many abettors thereof, making them
quickly throw down their weapons at the feet of truth, and become
captives unto it; bitter invectives without arguments againſt errors,
hereſie, &amp;c. are unto them as the Egyptian perſecution was unto the
<hi>Iſraelites,</hi> the more they be thus dealt withall, the more they grow;
the ſpirit of conviction doth not uſually appear in whirlewinde,

and Chriſtian debating, reaſoning, and arguing out the truth; it is
moſt true, it is good to be zealouſly affected in a good thing, yea, that
our zeale ſhould even eat us up, but we muſt be zealous according to
knowledge, not to eat up our brethren; it is reaſon and not railing
that conjures errors out of mens judgements; why ſhould the ſonnes
of error be wiſer than the ſonnes of truth? they inſinuate errors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their proſelytes, they watch to deceive, they come under the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of humilitie, meekneſſe, and ſweetneſſe, to ſeduce the ſimple;
if you will undeceive them, you muſt be that in ſincerity, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers
are in hypocriſie, <hi>viz.</hi> truely humble, truely meek, and kinde;
'twas <hi>Pauls</hi> rule, eſpecially towards fallen brethren, <hi>to reſtore them
with the ſpirit of meekneſſe;</hi> it was his practice <hi>to catch men by guile;</hi>
its no marvaile, that errors abound amongſt us, when men inſtead
of rooting them up by a ſtrong hand of arguing, doe onely tread up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them (as upon Cammamell) by lowd reproaches, reaſonleſſe
declamations, &amp;c. making them indeed rather to grow and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply;
God (if we may ſo ſay) doth often need mens patience, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
humility, but never needs mens paſſions, frowardneſſe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſſe;
this is to goe down into the Land of darkneſſe to fetch
light, to apply our ſelves to Satans Magazin, to furniſh us with wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous
to fight the Lords battles; this is for vice to correct ſinne;
When men come to heare reaſon againſt error, and finde nothing
but railing, what is this but to feed men with ſtones inſtead of

convince men by arguing and reaſoning, as Chriſt did, and not as the
Scribes, it would make men aſtoniſhed at their doctrine, and error
and hereſie, like <hi>Dagon</hi> before the Arke, would not ſtand before the
truths of God ſo mannag'd and aſſerted.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Doe you complain that the worke of reformation is
hindered, <hi>Sanballads</hi> and <hi>Tobyaſſes</hi> obſtruct the building of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
wee have been a great while in expectation of ſetling Religion,
but alas all is in vaine, wee have nothing but an empty ſhew of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
Presbytery is deſpiſed, ſleighted, we are farther off from
reformation than wee were ſeverall yeares ſince.</p>
               <p>Who hinders your reformation but your ſelves? have you not all
incouragements unto a reformation? were ever any of you troubled
for the exactneſſe, ſtrictneſſe, or purity of your reformation? may
you not keep any man, how great ſoever he be, from your Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115439:28"/>
who lives ſcandalouſly, looſely, or in groſſe ignorance? is it
not evident, as the Sunne at noone-day, that nothing ſtands in your
way, but your ſelves? may not all men of diſcerning ſpirits ſee and
perceive, what it is that hinders your reformation? ſhall we dictate
unto you the common obſervations of ſeeing men, <hi>viz.</hi> that you
take not a right method for a pure reformation; for is not this your
Cuſtome, you call in all your Pariſh (if houſe-keepers) to chooſe
your Elders, your Elders they admit of your members to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and ſo your reformation is made up? is it not too notorious
that the moſt of men are not the beſt of men; nay, have not you
often told us, that the moſt of men are the worſt of men? and can
the worſt of men bring about the beſt of reformations? will the worſt
of men make choice of the beſt of rulers, except it be through the
wonderfull providence and interpoſition of the hand of God? doe
not wee plainly ſee, that the moſt of men have not principles lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards a ſtrict, a pure, a ſpirituall reformation? doe not men
generally <hi>know men after the fleſh,</hi> and eſteeme them accordingly?
Whence is it, that wee ſee the great man, though the ignorant man,
the rich man, though the prophane man, the Deputie, the Common-Councell-man,
the Juſtice of peace, the chiefe man in the Pariſh, he
muſt be the Elder, though an ordinary ſwearer, an ignorant, a looſe,
a covetous perſon? Doth not every eye obſerve this in the Citie, in
the Countrey, &amp;c. and can you drive on that reformation which you
pretend unto in this method? are you tied and neceſſitated unto this
way? Will not ſwearing, ignorant, covetous, unclean, and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Elders admit of the like Communicants and Members? and can
you reforme according to your profeſt deſires in this courſe? Doe
you ſay, you have not power to doe otherwiſe? is your government
from heaven, or of men? if it be from heaven, as you profeſſe, and a
<hi>jus divinum</hi> be ſtampt upon it; what though you have not the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of men to joyne with you in the work of the Lord; the time
(perhaps) is not yet come when the earth ſhall help the Woman?
will you doe nothing for the Name of Chriſt, untill you have the
powers of the world to aſſiſt you? is this to doe the will of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
is this to walke as you have Chriſt and the Apoſtles for your
patterne? do you pleaſe men? if you yet pleaſe men, how are you
the ſervants of Chriſt?</p>
               <p>Will that old ſpirit of fearing the face of man, which poſſeſt many
of you in the dayes of the Prelats, never be gone out of you? Doe
you profeſſe with the Scribe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 19, 20. <hi>to follow Chriſt whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
he goes;</hi> and when he tells you, <hi>The Foxes have holes, and the

Fowles of the aire have neſts, but the Sonne of Man hath not where to
lay his head:</hi> will you with the Scribe ſteale away, and let Chriſt
heare of you no more? Is it not a Snaily diſpoſiti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

onely in the dew, and to creep in during the heat of the day? Is it
Chriſtian to <hi>cry Hoſanna</hi> unto Chriſt with the people, while the
<hi>garments and Palm-branches</hi> are ſpread, but to ſlink away <hi>when hee
is led to mount Calvery?</hi> Would you live by the Truth, and not
ſuffer the Truth to live upon you?</p>
               <p>Perhaps you will ſay, that however the Sectaries deſpiſe Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy,
yet you will not diſtaſte Authority by ſuch an haſty pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of that government which you could wiſh was ſet up, and
therefore would have power from them to carry on the worke of
Reformation in peace, that the noiſe of the hammer may not be
heard in Temple work. We reply,</p>
               <p>Your care not to provoke Authority we abundantly perceive by

makes men think that your zeale for reformation is your zeale to

               <p>A paſſionate, peeviſh, froward, pettiſh, perverſe Profeſſor, is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
acquainted with the truth as it is in Jeſus, meekneſſe encapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
a man to receive the truth. <hi>James</hi> 1. 21. A froward heart and
a perverſe tongue, or pen, commonly goeth together; and <hi>Salomon</hi>
ſaith, that <hi>one findeth no good, and the other falleth into miſchiefe,</hi> Prov.
17. 20. He that thinketh he knoweth nothing as he ought to know,
is in the ſweeteſt capacity to be taught of the Father, who filleth the
hungry with good things, but ſendeth the rich empty away. Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
the proud, he giveth grace to the humble, the Lord guideth the
meeke in judgement, and them will he teach his way, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 9.
Thoſe who are become like weaned children, doth he teach know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and underſtand doctrine, <hi>Eſay</hi> 28. 9. A froward heart and
tongue, is an abomination unto the Lord, and therefore the ſecrets
of the Lord cannot be with ſuch. Swelling words commonly come
from ſhallow braines; and the moſt ignorant are moſt conceited;
<hi>With the owly there is wiſdome,</hi> Prov. 11. 2. A railing tongue is
like the <hi>raging waves, foaming out its own ſhame,</hi> Jude 13. The Lord
teacheth the lowly perſon, and ſuch is fit to teach his brother.</p>

Men doe much prejudice the truth by a paſſionate endeavour to
vindicate the ſame, rayling language and invective lines, vailes the
truth that it cannot be ſeen, who loves to drinke in troubled wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
or puddle ſtreames? When mens foame of malice, envie and
diſcontent, appeare in the ſurface of their peeviſh lines, who will
look for truth therein? A ſmooth tongue ſhall not bewitch us: for
we wil examine what it affirmes. A ſcolding tongue ſhall not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
us; for we wil never beſtow the pains to hear it, truth hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
need of paſſion, but oft of patience. A froward tongue oft-times
ſtirres up other mens paſſions, but ſeldome ſetleth any mans judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
frowardneſſe raiſeth up frowardneſſe, and ſtrife ſtirreth up
ſtrife, and both together rejoyceth the Devill, and ſporteth his
children, and the truth is neglected all the while. He that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to conquer error with good ſucceſſe, muſt bring along with
him <hi>Meeknes</hi> and <hi>Truth;</hi> and having both, may ride on and proſper,

               <p>Men doe ſeldome contend for truth in a railing Dialect, it is
maſtery more than truth that is ſo ſought out, paſſion, envy, hatred,
malice, are the fruits of the fleſh, and can theſe contend for their
deſtroyer, the ſpirit of truth?</p>
               <p>Conſider how doth it gratifie the deſignes of the adverſarie,
that the Saints ſhould thus wrangle each with his brother? how
doth this cheere up the Popiſh, Epiſcopall, Presbyteriall, Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent,
Antinomian, Anabaptiſticall, Jeſuite: For we preſume
the Jeſuite perſonates them all, and whoſe ends we proſecute by
our unhappy diviſions amongſt our ſelves: how is this told in
<hi>Gath,</hi> &amp; publiſhed in <hi>Askalon?</hi> how do the daughters of the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtims</hi>
rejoyce, and the daughters of the uncircumciſed triumph?
how do they jeere at our diſcord, that we our ſelves prove thorns
in one anothers eyes, and goads in one anothers ſides? boaſting
that they laſht us with rods, but we our ſelves with Scorpions, and
that our own little fingers will we heavier upon one another, than
their loynes were upon us all. They oppreſt us, and we were pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied
of all; we oppreſſe our ſelves, and then who pitieth us? They
ruin'd us by an uſurpation, and ſhall we ſtrive to ruine one another
by a law? They cruſht us by the heavie ſentences of the high
Commiſſion and Star-chamber, and ſhall we endeavour to doe the
ſame by the authority of Parliament? If we love not one another,
let us love our ſelves; for each undermineth his own ſecurity, by
circumventing his brothers peace.</p>

How doe Saints loſe in each others hearts, when they gall and

with the briefe tender of ſome few Queries.</p>
               <p>Firſt, whether you did ever perceive ſuch a ſpirit of profaneneſſe, lewdneſſe
and wickedneſſe, ſuch contempt, ſcorn and reproach caſt upon Authoritie
and all Civill Government in Citie and Kingdom, ſuch a ſpirit of life, power
and vigor among the troops of malignants, ſince the beginning of this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
as you doe now: And whether this kind of preaching and praying
as bath been here declared, doe not beget theſe things, every malignant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
in it?</p>
               <p>Secondly, whether you think in your conſciences that this ſpirit that is
thus raiſed, can be ſo ſoon allayed or no; and if not, what will be the iſſue
of it in the latter end?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whether you have obſerved ſince ſuch kind of preaching and
praying hath been practiſed among you, that the ſpirit of Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
of converſion unto God, and confirmation in Jeſus Chriſt, ſuch a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of knowledge, of love, and holineſſe, hath accompanied your Miniſtery,
and the obſervation thereof hath comforted your hearts?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, whether you are not perſwaded in your own hearts and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
that you have a great influence both in City and Countrey, upon
the hearts and ſpirits of the Inhabitants of the Kingdome, ſo farre to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile,
as to encourage or diſcourage, to engage the inhabitants of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
one way or another by preſſing vpon them the ſolemne League and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and whether your endeavours have not been improved to ſtirre up
the people againſt that party which God hath bleſſed in the ſubjection of the
common enemy of the Kingdome, and whether you can ſuppoſe, that if the
enemy prevaile, the conſideration of your own endeavours in pulling downe
miſchiefes upon your own heads, and upon the heads of all the godly party in
the Land, will not be as gall and wormwood, as a fire from beneath in
your very bowels, as darts of the Almighty ſticking in your ſides, and as a
ſword that will pierce your very ſoules?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, whether you doe not think in your conſciences, that the main end
of the Covenant, (ſo farre as it was religious) was the u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iting of all the
godly party againſt the common enemies of the kingdome of Jeſus Chriſt,
the prophane rabble of the world, and ſo farre as the end of the Covenant
was Civill) the uniting of all the well-affected againſt the common enemies
of the peace, intereſt, and liberties of the Kingdome, (the Covenant binding
us abſolutely to the Parliament and their priviledges, the Kingdome and its
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:115439:34"/>
liberties, and to the King but relatively and in ſubordination and ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viencie
unto theſe,) and whether that now the Covenant be not made
(through the interpretation put upon it) the great engine to divide the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
party, and to unite the prophane party againſt them, and to engage and
ſtirre up mens ſpirits againſt the Parliament and well-affected party, and to
ſtand for the King abſolutely, without any relation or reſpect to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and their priviledges, the Kingdome and their liberties?</p>
               <p>Sixthly, whether the Army of <hi>England</hi> be not the great obſtacle and
<hi>Remora</hi> of the Malignants, the Papiſts, the Cavaliers, the Prelaticall
and diſaffected party of the Kingdome; and whether any thing appeares in
reaſon to hinder the King and his party, that have engaged themſelves in
ſuch bloody warres in the two Kingdomes, the Prelats to return to their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
power and greatneſſe, the Papiſts to return into, nay to advance their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in this kingdome; and not onely the reducing of this Kingdome unto
all its former ſinfull vanities, wickedneſſes, miſeries and oppreſſions, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
the bringing of it up (or rather down) unto that ſtate of Popery and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
that was in proſecution before this Parliament began, (whether we ſay
any thing hinders theſe things at this time) but the Army, or at leaſt ſo
hinders as could hinder, was it not for the Army, and whether any party
hath caſt ſuch ſcorne, ſhame and contempt upon the Army as your ſelves have
done?</p>
               <p>Seventhly, whether it would not be more for the glory of God, the peace of
the Kingdome, the healing our diviſions, the ſetling of reformation, to throw
by your froward preaching, and to uſe no more perverſneſſe in prayer, but to
promote faith and love amongst the the Saints, and the reuniting them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt
that flood of ungodlineſſe, malignity and wickedneſſe that is now
ready to ſwallow them up.</p>
               <p>Eighthly and laſtly, whether it would not be the beſt vindication of your
holineſſe and goodneſſe, the moſt effectuall anſwer that you can make to the
charges that are laid againſt you in this booke, to behave your ſelves ſo (for
future) eſpecially in Pulpit, that others, and not your ſelves, may hereafter
plead your integrety and reformation; we expect to have little from you in
preaching and praying (at leaſt a good while) but a juſtification of your ſelves,
and lifting up of your ſelves, and pleading your own innocency, &amp;c. but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be not better ſo to order your wayes, that others (and they not your own
engaged party) but moderate, pious, learned, and godly (Miniſters and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers)
may praiſe you, and not your own lips.</p>
               <p rend="italic">If you do judge a juſt and righteous judgement in theſe Queries, we are confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of common good; but if not, we ſhall conclude with that of <hi>Hoſea</hi> 9. 7.
