            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Yea, one can not miſſe of the promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

hart cannot faint, his ſtrength cannot

Ryches are in the number of good
thinges, and are the bleſſinges of God,
and therfore there can bee no exceſſe of
them, becauſe there is no exceſſe of a
good thing. Thys reaſon becauſe it is
ſo well pytcht on the heads of worldly
<pb facs="tcp:5974:23"/>
cormorants, that they take it for a hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,
muſt be wyth great conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

bleſſynges of God, and a cleare light of

there any exceſſe in the Lordes beſtow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing,

Ariſtotle did eſpecially wryte hys firſt
Booke <hi>de caelo.</hi> It is (I ſay) of the inor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dinate
appetite of man, which becauſe
it is exceſſiue, it muſt of force proſecute
an exceſſe of riches. And thus it may be
prooued, that it hath ſuch an obiecte to
worke vpon. Euery thing whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it hath
gotten a ſufficient and proper matter
to worke vppon, employeth his force to
that thing onely, as hauing a taſke pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed

were the proper obiect and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of worldly deſire, then hauing got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

the wealth that it firſte deſired, and

            <p>It is not to be doubted, but the ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
wherewith God aduaunced <hi>Iob,</hi>
were very ſingular, and the rare bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinges
of the Almighty, but the deuill
that erronious Serpent, vſed them as
a bayte and ſnare to intrappe the ſoule
of <hi>Iob.</hi> For he imagining that his ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
had lulled him in ſecuritie, and
intangled his conſcience, thought that
the ſpoyle of <hi>Iob</hi> hys ryches, woulde
haue béene the ſacking of the ſoule. So
riches were an inſtrument of abuſe to

in him a diſcontented deſire, &amp; brought

            <p>There is nothing in the worlde ſo
precious, but it may be abuſed, as a gly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering
Pearle, may bee placed in a
Swines ſnoute: the abuſe of ryches, is
the exceſſe of riches in mans minde,
which becauſe it is an abuſe, it muſt

it muſt not be coueted, leaſt ſwelling

may be ſpoken touching the abuſe of

            <p>It is no doubt, but they are the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes
of Iuſtice, and the honourable

            <p>If yée will haue a witneſſe more

Rome: which was ſo waſted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed

ſéemed rather to bee a ſhamble to the

<pb facs="tcp:5974:25"/>

drawne againſt the naked common
Weale, one Shéepe was committed to

contempt, was the funerall of theyr
common Weale. Theſe actions did fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
and immitate the contentions of
<hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Sylla. Marius</hi> made little
eſtimation of all the Nobility, <hi>Sylla</hi>
did take <hi>Marius</hi> for a vile &amp; baſe borne
creature, as an abiect or forlorne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
but this light contempt was of
great waight, and the ſcalefire of pryde
could not be extinguiſhed or repreſſed
without the downefall of the common
Weale.<note place="margin">Villeius Pater cul.</note> 
               <hi>Marius</hi> béeing conſtrayned fled

            <p>Thus were honours peruerſlye
drawne from their proper ende, to the

yet it is moſt certaine, that they bee
God his ſpeciall benefites and ſignes of

It is beſt therefore to ſéeke the glorye

            <p>The continuaunce of this dyſcourſe

hauing nothing, hath nothing to bee

our Commedie into a Tragedye,
and our laughter into lamentation. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
doubtfull rumor of a perillous

that we feele as it were a worme, fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

that maketh vs to ſhake, and all our

a man diſcharge himſelfe of this bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
if he would profeſſe a ſolitary and
chaſte life: which I will firſt illuſtrate
by a ſimilitude, and afterward by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

his Teſtament, he renounceth the
worlde, and in a little paper hee dooth
orderly and conueniently diſpoſe euery
thing. When he is dead, he is neuer
more likely to be troubled againe wyth
ſuch cares, or with any worldly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
which is the fountaine of ſorrow,
of which, as often as we thinke, wee
cannot chooſe but ſighe. If a man wold

<pb facs="tcp:5974:29"/>

ſitteth on the throne of wealth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed
with a large circle of freendes,
hath (as long as the ſun-ſhyne of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
doth warme his bagges, and as

euery man to caſt vppe hys eyes)
a great multitude of fréends, but when
Fortune beginneth to wage battayle
wyth him, when his riches be melted,
and his authority eclipſed, then euerye
fréende flincheth from him, and then he
is as wylling for ſhame and ſorrow to
forſake hys freendes, béeing then by
compulſion enforced to leade a ſolitarie
life. And ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

To be chained to a fréende, is a ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,

to leape beyond the line, to raunge out

Nowe, when after our pleaſures com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth

Let them thinke of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> miſerable Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,
which contayneth the powers of
darknes, that loathſome lake of hell,
where the deuills are plunged, as in a

There is continuall gnaſhing of

Let them to whom God permitteth
