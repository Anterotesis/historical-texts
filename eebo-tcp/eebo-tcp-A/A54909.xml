            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

HISTORY
OF THE
Perſecutions, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE Encroachments of the King of <hi>France</hi> upon the <hi>Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Orange,</hi> were the Fore-runners of the Perſecution of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi>
there: In the year 1660, that King making himſelf Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of that <hi>Principality,</hi> demoliſhed thoſe ſtately Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which were raiſed by Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> of glorious Memory, as the
Monuments of his ſtrength and power. For five years the State conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
thus in the hands of Strangers; and God knows great were the
Churches Troubles in that <hi>Interregnum.</hi> The <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> who till now,
had kept themſelves within the bounds of Moderation, began now to
lift up the <hi>Standard of Diviſion,</hi> and eſtabliſht a <hi>Fraternity,</hi> without the
conſent or permiſſion of their lawful Prince, and within a little time
grew very powerful by the Money which they drew from all parts, that
ſo they might more eaſily oppreſs the Reformed: They employ'd their
Money for the purchaſing of Converts, which was intended by thoſe
who furniſht 'em with it. Theſe <hi>falſe Zealots</hi> uſed their utmoſt skill to
corrupt the Childrens Obedience they owed to their Parents; and they
ſet up a Houſe at <hi>Avignon</hi> for the Entertainment of 'em: And if they
could not be won by favours, and milder courſes, they ſerved themſelves
with the Authority of the Officers, to take them by force.</p>
            <p>I may give you ſome taſte of the beginning of our Evils, by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Account: A Child of nine years old, whoſe name was <hi>Louis Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leneve,</hi>
was accuſed as guilty of ſome Irreverence in the Chappel that
they made in the Caſtle: The poor Child was clapt up in a cloſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
where it ſpent the night in continual Cries and Lamentations to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40628:3"/>
its Father and Mother, for their help. The <hi>Sunday</hi> following, the
Child was brought in open veiw, at the uſual time when the <hi>Proteſtants</hi>
went to the Temple; and being tied neck and heels together, and whipt
by the common Hangman, which he did with tears and reluctance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forc'd to it by the Souldiers of the Gariſon, who were about him;
and the Drums beating at the four parts of the Town.</p>
            <p>The Edict about the <hi>Relapſt,</hi> was publiſht at the ſame time in <hi>France.</hi>
The Governour of the Caſtle ſent four Guards to bring me to the
Caſtle, thinking to fright me with this <hi>Pageantry</hi> of War; when I
drew near him, he told me, the King intended this Edict ſhould extend
to the <hi>Principality:</hi> Whereupon I anſwer'd him, The Edict mention'd one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the King's Subjects; that he could not look upon theſe of the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality</hi>
as ſuch, ſince they lived under the Edicts of another Prince,
and ſo could acknowledge any other Laws but his. At this Anſwer
he flew out in a Rage, and fell a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> of me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and seeing me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
ſteadily to maintain it, he turn'd from me on a ſudden, <hi>You
ſhall quickly ſee</hi> (ſays he) <hi>who 'tis you ſpeak to.</hi> I was not concerned at
his Threatnings, but the more danger they carried, ſo much the more
firm was I to my reſolution: In effect, a few days after the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their <hi>Fete-Dieu,</hi> not contenting themſelves with their allowed Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms,
but indeavouring to Innovat<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, by hanging their Tapeſtry up,
and carrying it farther then the bounds that were preſcribed by the
Edicts of our Princes: I oppoſed 'em ſo, till they were forc'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
notwithſtanding they came backt with the Authority of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
and his Gariſon.</p>
            <p>We now began to be forc't to continual Diſputes, to maintain the
Priviledges of our Church; 'twas hardly any longer that we could find
Juſtice with the Magiſtrates, tho' they exerciſed their power in the
Prince's Name and Authority; for either through particular Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or through baſe Courtſhip to the Governour, they were not toucht
by the Churches Calamities; and inſtead of oppoſing this tide of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
which broke in upon us, they ſuffer'd us to be run down by
their <hi>Compliances,</hi> or the <hi>Intregues</hi> of State.</p>
            <p>Before the Cittadel was demoliſht, the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> carried themſelves
very quietly all the time of the <hi>Advent,</hi> the <hi>Lent,</hi> and <hi>Octaves;</hi> and
the Prieſts did not in their Sermons annimate the people againſt the
Reformed, neither did they provoke us to Diſputes: And if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
at any time that the Prieſts ſpoke too freely againſt us, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts</hi>
themſelves uſed to tell 'em, that this was not the Cuſtom at
<hi>Orange,</hi> and that therefore they ſhould uſe Moderation. This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
held till a foreign Power got ground, and then they quickly alter'd
their Maxims. And whereas before we ſaw very ſeldom any <hi>Jeſuites</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:40628:3"/>
at <hi>Orange,</hi> they were now ſaught after in great Zeal, to ſupply the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits;
theſe Gentlemen at their firſt coming (according to their poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Conduct) gain'd upon the people, by a free Converſation, and by
the outward ſhew of promoting Peace and Agreement with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But before the <hi>Advent</hi> was half over, they could no longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
their natural Temper, and talkt of nothing but of Hereſie and
Damnation, and challeng'd all to the Controverſie. This task lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me, which for two and twenty years I diſcharged by God's aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
with ſome advantage to his Truth, and the confuſion of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
            <p>Had they made uſe of no other Weapons in their Warfare, then Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
to maintain the Diſpute, it might then have ended with Joy
to me; the Conteſt would have been determin'd without loſs, to me,
or damage to my Church; nay, rather it might have reapt glory from
the occaſion. But the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> found that this would not do their
Work, and therefore they betook themſelves to other courſes, whereby
they might gain thoſe, whom they moved not by their Controverſie.
Hence their Hatred againſt us was every day working, either by falſe
Witneſſes, by Lying or Cheats; and from this their Deſign, the Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
was modelled, that we have ſince ſeen in <hi>France,</hi> from the year
1660; and they ſeem'd to be learning the Trade of Cruelty againſt
us, that they might be Maſters at it, when they were to exerciſe it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
others.</p>
            <p>It ſhall be ſufficient for me to give you two inſtances, wherein they gave
great trouble to our Church: Upon the Birth of Mr. <hi>le Dauphin</hi> there
was Joy all over <hi>France,</hi> and 'twas a Cuſtom among us of the <hi>Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
likewiſe to obſerve that Day, which we uſed to do with more Show
and Acclamations than the <hi>French</hi> themſelves; to teſtifie our Affection
to the King, at the end of <hi>November</hi> 1661, 'twas concluded upon, that
Bonfires ſhould be made, and that all the Prince's Subjects of either
Religion, ſhould rejoyce for the Birth of the <hi>Dauphin.</hi> The Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſeem'd moſt affected for the Day, and readieſt to perform thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd
Solemnities; however, the Joy they expreſt upon this Feaſt,
contributed to their Misfortune, for many were accuſed of ſpeaking ill
of the King; and the next day nothing was heard of but Crimes and
Accuſations, without mentioning the perſons whom they accus'd.
They were ſo well inſtructed by their Malice, that I was brought in
to the Accuſation; and 'twas whiſpered about, that I went to Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi>
a Merchant, and to other Citizens, to perſwade 'em not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
the Rejoycings; or at leaſt, to vent ſome diſ-reſpectful Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes,
which they charg'd 'em with: Upon this they immediately
clapt up Mr. <hi>Armand</hi> in a Dungeon, and in Chains, and the reſt made
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40628:4"/>
their eſcape by flight. I cannot here but reflect upon the furious Zeal
the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> are inſpired with, when they fixt an Accuſation upon
myſelf, who that morning in the Pulpit gave all the teſtimonies of my
Zeal for the Proſperity of the King, for long Life to the <hi>Dauphin;</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I was not much concern'd at the report, ſeeing I found no man
durſt openly accuſe me. I was not the only man in this matter; the
Malice of our Perſecutors, who were mightily influenc'd by a Woman
of ill Reputation, Madam <hi>Redonnet,</hi> gave great fears to others too of
being brought into the ſame Misfortune. They ſuborn'd falſe Witneſſes.
Mr. <hi>Itier,</hi> and <hi>Rouſſas</hi> were condemn'd to the Gallies; the latter died
either through the ſlavery of it, or from the anguiſh of his mind, and
Mr. <hi>Itier</hi> had his liberty, by the great application of the late Mr. <hi>Zui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lychem,</hi>
who was ſent Envoy to the <hi>French</hi> Court, from the Governours
of the Prince, to demand Reſtitution of the <hi>Principality.</hi> This excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
perſon did ſo manifeſtly convince Mr. <hi>de Brienne, Councellor, and
Secretary of State,</hi> that as to the matters whereof we were accuſed,
'twas all a Cheat, and a malicious Deſign; ſo that both the accuſed;
and he that was condemn'd to the Gallies, were acquitted; which will
be a laſting <hi>Reflection</hi> upon the ill Deſigns of our Perſecutors againſt
us.</p>
            <p>The ſecond inſtance I ſhall give, carried with it equal Malice, but
was of much worſe conſequence, 'twas this: Upon a <hi>Sunday</hi> when the
<hi>Carmelites</hi> gave the Bleſſing, over againſt the Church-door, the late
Mr. <hi>de Bedarrides,</hi> an eminent Councellour, had a Chamber whoſe Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
lookt towards the Church, where it happen'd a great many were,
and the Church was ſo crowded that many were forc'd to ſtay at the
Door, among whom there were ſeveral of the Acquaintance of thoſe
who were in the Chamber at a Collation; there being one in the Room
who held out a Glaſs of Wine to a Friend of his, to invite him to
drink, the people preſently cried out, <hi>Sacriledge, Impiety;</hi> and laid their
Accuſation againſt thoſe in the Room: they charg'd 'em with counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting
the Prieſt, and doing Mockery to their Myſteries, and demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Juſtice of the Parliament: This did not ſatisfie 'em, but they wrote
of it to the Court, and had got ſuch credit to the Report, that the late
Mr. <hi>de Beſons,</hi> Intendant of the Province of <hi>Languedock,</hi> was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to go to <hi>Orange,</hi> to enquire into the truth of the matter, and to ſend
an Account of it. Thoſe who were the accuſed, were frighted at what
happened, and retired from the State, nor durſt ever return till by the
Protection of their lawful Prince. Mr. <hi>Beſons,</hi> according to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
came to the place; went both to the Altar of the Church,
and to the Room where the Accuſed were, to ſee if the Altar and the
Room lookt to each other, ſo that perſons might ſee each other from

the Chamber to the Altar; but found, when he ſaw the places, that
neither could ſee each other, and that therefore that Charge of Imitating
the Prieſts, or Mocking their Ceremonies, could not be intended; but
was rather the forc'd Interpretation of their Malice and ill Will: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
tho' Mr. <hi>Beſons</hi> was ſatisfied in the matter, and was a man of
good Reputation, yet he ſeem'd not inclin'd to do the Reformed any
ſervice in it; but left 'um under an apprehenſion that ſome farther
trouble would be brought upon 'um; yet 'tis probable, he repreſented
to the Court the Innocence of the Accuſed, ſince nothing more fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
but the Decree of the Parliament of <hi>Orange,</hi> which condemn'd
'em to Fines and Baniſhment. One cannot queſtion the ill Deſigns of
theſe falſe Accuſers, when I ſhall tell you, that a year after this, making
a Viſit to Mr. <hi>Beſons,</hi> who was going by <hi>Orange,</hi> the <hi>Carmelites</hi> came to
him at the ſame time, but not having confidence to ſpeak of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
while I was with him; Mr. <hi>Beſons</hi> coming out with me when I
took my leave, ſtopt me of a ſudden, and addreſſing himſelf to the
<hi>Carmelites, What do you deſire Fathers?</hi> (ſays he) <hi>Mr.</hi> de Chambrun <hi>is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.</hi>
The good Fathers made a long Speech to him, ſhewing him the
great charge they had been at in the Suit, and yet the Parliament had not
re-imburc'd 'em, which gave great diſorder to the <hi>Fraternity.</hi> Mr. <hi>Beſons</hi>
took 'em up, interrupting 'em, <hi>Ye have</hi> (ſays he) <hi>taken up a Cauſe without good
grounds; ye have not done well to theſe poor People: I have been at the place,
and found no reaſon for the Accuſation; if you have not wherewithal, you
muſt ſell your</hi> Chalices, <hi>and be more cautious for the future.</hi> Upon this the
<hi>Carmelites</hi> were ſurpriz'd at Mr. <hi>Beſens</hi>'s anſwer, and the more, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there while 'twas ſpoken. Mr. <hi>Beſons</hi> turning to me, (ſays he)
<hi>Have I not treated them well; theſe</hi> Monks <hi>are the moſt troubleſome of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, upon the <hi>Principality's</hi> being reſtored to the <hi>Prince of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range,</hi>
in the year 1665, we continued in a pretty good ſtate of Quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
till the year 1672, when the War broke out, and the King of <hi>France,</hi>
by his Edict, ſeized again the <hi>Principality</hi> by Reprizal, and gave it to
the Count <hi>d'Auvergne:</hi> During the time it was in this Count's hands,
there were few things which Malice could invent, but were practiſed
againſt us. The Country-men who labour'd to demoliſh the Caſtle,
thought good, before they went away, to ſet up two large Croſſes of
Wood, which had been made uſe of to other purpoſes about the Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeen,
in the Caſtle; they placed one of the Croſſes upon the <hi>Red Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,</hi>
looking towards the <hi>East;</hi> and the other they placed upon the
<hi>Baſtion du Rhône,</hi> which faced the <hi>West.</hi> Theſe gave <hi>Offence,</hi> and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd
us much trouble.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:40628:5"/>
A little while after, theſe two Croſſes were pull'd down; and they
charg'd ſome men of conſiderable note with this pretended <hi>Sacriledge;</hi>
but by good providence the deſign was found out, for 'twas clearly
proved upon the <hi>Curé,</hi> Father <hi>Omagi,</hi> a man of very ill Life, and
Ignorant, and of more than ordinary Malice to the Reformed; who
had ſuborn'd ſome young men, to accuſe theſe perſons of Quality with
it: However, this hindred not, but that this <hi>Prieſt</hi> puſht the matter on
farther; he procur'd Mr. <hi>Aimard</hi> (an Advocate in the Parliament) to
draw up a <hi>Petition</hi> to the King, ſuggeſting many Falſhoods, which
were purpoſely deſigned to render us obnoxious; and to put a ſtop to
the collecting of Money for the Preachers, which was for the Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the Paſtors, and of the Profeſſors and Governours of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
I had a ſight of the <hi>Petition;</hi> and a Friend of mine has ſtill a
Copy of it, which poſſibly I may publiſh to the World, to give an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Character of thoſe Eccleſiaſticks. But, however, the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition</hi>
was not anſwer'd; they had other matters in hand, and this lay
by till a more favourable opportunity. This ſatisfied not the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> he
preſented another <hi>Petition</hi> to Mr. <hi>le Count d'Auvergne,</hi> who enjoy'd the
<hi>Principality</hi> by Reprizal, deſigning that St. <hi>Martin</hi>'s Church might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
to the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> which my People poſſeſt by vertue of the Edicts
of our Princes. But the Count <hi>d'Auvergne</hi> was wiſe and cautious, and
would not innovate, after he had ſeen our Princes Edicts, which I ſent
him by his Intendant.</p>
            <p>I did not ſo little underſtand how matters were carried, at <hi>Orange,</hi>
but that I clearly ſaw this <hi>Prieſt</hi> was not the chief Agent: There was
Mr. <hi>Jean Jacques d Obeille Abbot,</hi> and Count <hi>de Montfort,</hi> who was now
come to fill up the <hi>Biſhoprick;</hi> he ſo well inſinuated himſelf into the
Peoples affections, by ſhewing himſelf diſpoſed for peace, that they
thought themſelves happy in him, as the circumſtances of the times then
were; and that there was now a Biſhop at <hi>Orange</hi> who lov'd not Strife
and Contention. For my own part, I was not won to the opinion by
thoſe appearances; quickly diſcovering that the <hi>Prieſt</hi> was but the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's</hi>
Inſtrument, to bring his Miſchief about; and the event gave re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
to my conjecture: for the Biſhop being a perſon of good Wit,
he foreſaw that the Peace was like to be concluded, and therefore he
would not appear againſt the Reformed, leaſt when his Highneſs the
<hi>Prince</hi> was reſtored to his Rights, he might repent of his acting againſt
the Edicts of the <hi>Prince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſhort, the Peace of <hi>Nimeguen</hi> being concluded, the <hi>Principality</hi>
was reſtored to its lawful Soveraign, according to one of the expreſs
Articles of the Peace. There was upon this great Joy at <hi>Orange,</hi> in
hopes that they might now have a Calm: but the Spirit of <hi>Popery,</hi> that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40628:5"/>
is ever wreſtleſs, loves not <hi>the ſoft and ſtill Wind, which God is ſaid to be
in;</hi> but quickly brought great Difficulties upon my Church. The day
which was ſolemniz'd for the concluſion of the Peace, afforded no great
Joy to the <hi>Papiſts:</hi> The Biſhop was the firſt that was obſerved to be
concern'd. The Citizens of both Religions went in Crowds to his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
where the Muſqueteers did him the honour of giving him a Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
of Shot: he took it ill of 'em, and lookt upon it, as if they did it to
affront him. 'Twas there poſſibly, that 'twas contriv'd that the two
Croſſes ſhould be pull'd down, and the Reformed accuſed of it. The
Citizens had continued three whole days in Arms, <hi>viz. Sunday, Munday</hi>
and <hi>Tueſday,</hi> and they were ſo wearied in their Attendance, that they all
fell aſleep, which gave an opportunity to ſome to contrive miſchief againſt
'em: For there was an <hi>Hermite</hi> who had boaſted, that this their Joy would
have no long continuance: Upon <hi>Tueſday</hi> or <hi>Wedneſday</hi>-night, he took two
Rogues with him to pull down the two Croſſes. 'Tis ſtrange what Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have for Croſſes; and yet that they ſhould ſo prophane
'um, when 'tis to do 'em ſervice againſt the Reformed. But there is
nothing ſacred or holy with them, but which they will abuſe to ſerve
their wicked Deſigns; Prophanation, Sacriledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are eſteem'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
if by that means they may deſtroy thoſe who paſs, with them for
Hereticks. We need not go farther for a proof then the Relation before
us: The Biſhop, who well knew what had been done, went full of
rage to the two Baſtions where the Croſſes had been ſet up, that he
might ſay, that he himſelf had ſeen it: and came down in great paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
promiſing that he would revenge it. He wrote to the Court of
<hi>France,</hi> heightning the Crime, as if their whole Religion was in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
However 'twas obſerv'd, that thoſe Croſſes were ſet up by the
Workmen only, without the Conſent of publick Authority; and that
they had never been Bleſt; ſo that they might well be lookt upon as
things indifferent. But this hinder'd not but that it paſt for the higheſt
Act of Sacriledge that had ever been done. There were a great many
Informations brought in; and whereas the Parliament might eaſily have
made ſuch an Inquiry as to have diſcover'd the perſons, they paſt it
over as if they were affraid to find out the Agents; and contented
themſelves to put out a Decree of the Baniſhment of <hi>John Poudrier;</hi>
tho' they had no manner of Evidence againſt him: But <hi>Tevenon,</hi> a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt,</hi>
who had aſſiſted the <hi>Hermite,</hi> and upon whom the Irons were
found, which kept up the Arms of the Croſſes, and who alſo fled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Citation, him they let alone without purſuing him farther.</p>
            <p>This Decree ſatisfied not the Biſhop, who never left writing to the
Court, till ſuch time as Mr. <hi>de Rouillet</hi> ſent him word, That he had
received order from the Court, to come with his Troops to chaſtiſe 'em
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40628:6"/>
for their Offence. A few Weeks after the Intendant's Secretary came
with order, to have the Croſſes put up again, and to ſet up another in
the Market-place; and in caſe they refus'd to obey, that there ſhould
come a Regiment of Dragoons, who were in <hi>Provence,</hi> to execute the
the pleaſure of the Court. They would alſo have had the Magiſtrates
among the Reformed, to have been preſent at the Ceremony in their
Hoods and Habits; which I endeavour'd all I could to prevent; tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
'em, that 'twas better to ſuffer any Misfortune, then baſely to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
at their Ceremony. But all that I could do, neither my Prayers
nor my Tears could diſſwade 'em: their Cowardiſe carried 'em from
their Duty; and their Fearfulneſs made 'em tell me, That I ſhould be
the Ruine of the Town. Mr. <hi>de Riomall,</hi> who was then at <hi>Orange</hi> in
Quality of <hi>Envoy</hi> for his Highneſs the <hi>Prince,</hi> oppoſed it as far as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible;
but not having power to prevent it, he went out of the Town,
reſolving not to be preſent at the ſetting up of the Croſſes. They for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
nothing that might make the Ceremony pompous; they ſent for
Muſick from <hi>Avignon;</hi> all the Dioceſs came in; and many came in
Proceſſion from far off, to ſolemnize this Day; the Town was fill'd
with the Religious of all ſorts; and all the Company went up to the
place where once the Caſtle ſtood, to ſee the Biſhop Bleſs the Croſs,
who was in all his pontifical Robes; they came down by the way
which ſhooted down to my Houſe, where the Muſick ſtood, playing
for ſome time; and the Biſhop, being near the Secretary, (ſays he, in
Rallery) <hi>Mr.</hi> Chambrun <hi>will have no reaſon to complain, being ſo well treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
From thence they went to the Market-place, where they ſet up a
new Croſs with the ſame Ceremonies.</p>
            <p>But all this was but as Lightning that did forerun thoſe cruel Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Claps which did break afterwards upon this <hi>Principality:</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the Peace of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi> acted againſt them,
as if he had been in actual War-againſt them; he diſmantled the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Orange,</hi> ſent his Dragoons into it in 1682, who did miſerably ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs
the poor people there. The Intendant of <hi>Provence</hi> cauſed ſeven or
eight men to be ſeized there, under pretence of being Relapſt: They
ſeized of the <hi>Prince's</hi> natural Subjects, who had all along profeſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Religion; they committed them to Priſons that belong'd to the
Parliament of <hi>Aix;</hi> where, after they had endured great Cruelties, and
hard Uſage, ſome of 'em chang'd to obtain their Liberty; others who
continued firm, were condemn'd to Fines and Penalties, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to quit the Kingdom upon pain of Death. This ſort of Cruelty
began to ſtartle our people; when no man could look upon himſelf
ſafe, tho' in his own Houſe; they expected daily to find the Officer
at their Doors; and were not delivered of their Fears, till they heard
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40628:6"/>
that Mr. <hi>Heinſius</hi> was to go in the Quality of Envoy Extraordinary
from L. H. P. to the Court of <hi>France,</hi> who had very much reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the pulling down of the Walls. But every one knows the ſucceſs
he had; for they maintained, that they had right to do what they
did: And tho' Mr. <hi>Heinſius</hi> proved it clearly to the Marqueſs <hi>de Croiſſi,</hi>
that they had infring'd upon the Peace of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> by pulling down
the Walls; and that the <hi>Principality of Orange</hi> was independent upon
<hi>France:</hi> yet he was forc'd to go back without Reparation for the Injury
they had done.</p>
            <p>And tho' the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> ought to regard this pulling down of
the Walls, as a common Evil, which they were as much concern'd
in, as we of the Reformed, yet they made this the Subject of their
Joy, and began to create us more trouble then before: The <hi>Priest</hi>
whom we have before given a Character of, brought in another Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
of Religious, which we had never before ſeen in <hi>Orange.</hi> The
<hi>Prince's</hi> Officers who perceived this Innovation would have very ill Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
oppos'd their Eſtabliſhment here: But the Biſhop who had put
the <hi>Prieſt</hi> upon it, took his part, and wrote to the Court of <hi>France,</hi> of
the oppoſition which the <hi>Prince's</hi> Advocate, and Proctor General, had
made againſt the Eſtabliſhment of this Fraternity. We know not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
what Anſwer this had; but 'tis very probable, they incourag'd
'em to go on; otherwiſe they had never dar'd to have rais'd ſuch a
Tumult as they did in <hi>June</hi> in the ſame year, upon the <hi>Sunday</hi> after
their <hi>Fete-Dieu:</hi> For upon that day there had like to have happen'd a
terrible Slaughter in <hi>Orange;</hi> this was the occaſion of the Tumult:
This Religious Order went in Proceſſion about ſix a Clock i'th' even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
thoſe who were the firſt that went out of the Cathedral-Church,
furniſht themſelves with Clubs, and other ſorts of Weapons, which
they kept under their Robes, to fall upon the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> whenever they
met any. As they went they lookt on all ſides to ſee if they could find
any. But our Conſiſtory had given particular Order to the People,
exhorting them at the Morning-Exerciſe, to keep at their own Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
ſo as to give no occaſion to theſe tumultuous People to offer any
Violence. Our People behaved themſelves very cautiouſly upon this
occaſion: but the Religious, who chiefly deſign'd ill under pretence of
Religion, bethought themſelves of flinging Stones into the <hi>Proteſtants</hi>
Houſes, and upon 'em. The <hi>Hermite,</hi> whom I have before ſpoken of,
with a little crooked Fellow call'd <hi>Delaire,</hi> were the forward'ſt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
this Violence; and tho' our People were extreamly provok'd, yet
they ſuffer'd all with great patience: So that theſe tumultuous People
finding no occaſion to execute their wicked Deſign, there coming ſome
Harveſt-men from <hi>Dauphine,</hi> who were a great way off of 'em, they
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40628:7"/>
quitted their Order in the Proceſſion, and fell upon 'em with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
violence, knocking 'em down with their Clubs; they on the other
ſide cried they were <hi>Catholicks,</hi> (as indeed they were;) but all this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed
'em not; they drag'd 'em along the Streets, tore their Cloaths,
and had it not been for ſome of the more moderate of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> they
had run them through with their Swords, which they had under the
Robe. This Tumult ſtopt the march of the Proceſſion. The Biſhop
was in the Church, juſt following the Hoſt; he knew nothing of the
occaſion of the Diſorder, and they who were next to him, told him,
the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> had made an attempt upon the Religious; and that they
were hard by, and adviſed him to eſcape, and ſave himſelf in his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace.
The Prelate took heels, and run croſs the Church in great haſte
to get to his Houſe; but as he was going, ſome honeſt Gentlemen met
him, and told him the truth of the matter, and ſo he came back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
Now, whilſt this Ceremony was in the Church, the <hi>Hermite,</hi>
with ſome few of the Religious, broke off from the Proceſſion, and
running about the Streets, cry'd out, that the Biſhop was kill'd, and the
Hoſt was ſeiz'd: and this Cry thoſe very men made, who were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
thirty Yards from the Biſhop: So that all the Papiſts of the Town,
eſpecially thoſe of the meaner Rank, run to their Houſes, arming
themſeves with Forks, or Spits, or Hatchets, and what came next to
their hands, reſolving to fall upon the Reformed: And they were ſo
tranſported with this Alarm, that they would not hearken to any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
they were told that 'twas a falſe Report, and that the Biſhop was
not dead; but they would not give credit to it: So that had it not
been for the Courage and Mediation of ſome of the Gentlemen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Reformed, who went to the Rabble to compoſe 'em, <hi>Orange</hi>
in a little time might have been ſeen without Inhabitants; for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
ſeeing the <hi>Papiſts</hi> betaking themſelves to their Arms for a Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre,
they alſo arm'd themſelves. I was in my Houſe alone, whilſt
all this noiſe was; and there came in a good Woman to tell me, with
Tears, <hi>Ah, Monſieur,</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>are you here alone; they are devouring
your Flock, and you'll be preſently ſacrificed to the Fury of the Religious.</hi> I
then heard a great cry in the Street; I beſought the good Woman to
call one of my Servants; ſhe told me, there was none in the way.
There then came in one of my Neighbours, pale and languiſhing, who
told me, that all our People were running to the place, to relieve our
Brethren whom they were maſſacring. I deſired him that he would
endeavour to ſtop 'em, and to tell 'em from me, that I would ſpeak
with 'em; there came to me ſome of 'em, whom I conſtrain'd to go
after the reſt to prevent their going to the Tumult. A little after they
came all of 'em to me, and taking my advice, retired to their Houſes.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40628:7"/>
Mr. <hi>de Bergairolles,</hi> who is now at the <hi>Hague,</hi> was very active in
calming ſome the moſt violent of their Men: and by this means
the Tumult was appeas'd, and thoſe of the Seditious Party, were
diſappointed of their Deſign. I draw'd up a Relation of all that
paſt, and ſent it to the late Mr. <hi>de Zuilichem,</hi> who ſignified to me
in his Anſwer, that God had miraculouſly deliver'd us; and that
he pray'd heartily we might never ſee ſuch another <hi>Sunday.</hi> The
day after, the Parliament intending to proceed againſt the Authors
of this Uproar, at the requeſt of the Proctor-General, and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate;
the Biſhop did all he could to oppoſe it with mighty Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings;
this gave great apprehenſions to the Reformed: We ſaw that
the <hi>French</hi> Court gave credit to all that the Biſhop wrote, and he
had others that ſtood by him; and that there needed nothing but
the pretence of Religion, to give authority to all they undertook.
The Parliament thought it not proper to puſh the Information far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
but his Highneſs the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> being inform'd of
this Attempt, and that it had like to have coſt him the Lives of the
beſt Subjects he had, gave out a Declaration, by the which he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
this Fraternity, and charg'd the Magiſtrates, that they ſhould
take care that they appeared not publickly.</p>
            <p>I have already ſpoke of the Prieſts preſenting a Requeſt, to have
a ſtop put to the Collection which was for the Maintenance of the
Paſtors, the Profeſſors and Governors of the Colledge, which was
not anſwer'd. The time being now more favourable for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
they preſented it a ſecond time, in the Year 1683. 'Twas
now anſwer'd with a Decree of the Council, by which the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer
was prohibited to raiſe that Money, upon pain of Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
with an injunction upon Mr. <hi>Grignan, the Lieutenant General
of Provence,</hi> to help forward the Execution of the Decree. 'Twas
a great blow to the Reformed Churches of the Principality, who
had now no way to get ſubſiſtence for the Paſtors, or Profeſſors
and Governours of the Colledge. But his Highneſs the Prince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
acquainted with it, he provided for them according to his uſual
Charity. The Misfortunes which befel us came blow after blow,
as the Lightning is follow'd by Thunder, which at laſt deſtroys all;
ſo that we might ſay, with St. <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revelations, The ſecond Woe
is paſt, and behold the third Woe cometh quickly.</hi> In the Year follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we ſaw another Decree of the Council in <hi>July,</hi> and which we
were advertized of in <hi>Auguſt</hi> following; and this was the pretence
of it. There was a Youth, called <hi>Dumas,</hi> a Notary, who during the
ſpace of two years, had been much converſant in reading of the
Holy Scripture; he had took great pleaſure in it, and from a deſire
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40628:8"/>
which he had to be farther inſtructed in it, he came on Nights to
me to be reſolved of difficulties, and to receive from me freſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions.
At laſt, being perſwaded and convinc'd of the Truth,
he came to the Conſiſtory, deſiring to be received in our Church,
and ſhewed great Reaſon, in giving us an account of the Motives
of his change. The Sunday following he made his Abjuration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the whole Aſſembly, who were much edified by his Diſcourſe.
This Young Man was of a Family who were extreamly bygotted
to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Superſtitions, whoſe Anceſtors were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
in our Annals, among thoſe who had committed that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Maſſacre at <hi>Orange,</hi> the ſecond of <hi>February,</hi> in the Year 71 of
the laſt Age. He reckoned in his Pedigree, ſome of the Richeſt,
and of the Chiefeſt Quality of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Citizens of
<hi>Orange.</hi> This Converſion of their Kinſman had enraged them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly;
they went in a croud to the Biſhop, and begg'd of him
with Tears, to uſe all means imaginable to draw him off from this
pretended Error. The Biſhop could not find a more ſucceſsful way
then to raiſe us ſome trouble in the Court of <hi>France,</hi> ſuppoſing we
had received a relapſed Subject of the <hi>French</hi> Kings. His Letter
was quickly followed by a Decree, which I am now going to ſpeak
of; by which 'twas prohibited for the Miniſters of <hi>Orange,</hi> or for
the Elders, to receive in their Temples any Subject of the King of
<hi>France</hi>'s that was a Relapſe; or to endeavour the perverting of the
Catholicks, to embrace Hereſie, upon the pains mentioned in the
Declarations, with an Injunction to the <hi>Count de Grignan,</hi> to help
forward the Execution of the ſaid Decree. This unheard-of way
of proceeding, with regard to the Principality of <hi>Orange,</hi> afforded
me many Reflections; the title of Hereſie, which they had not put
in any Declaration or Decree before, made me imagine they would
no longer uſe any Moderation; and this regulating the Affairs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in the Principality of <hi>Orange,</hi> perſwaded me, that we had
now nothing to hope for, but that very ſuddenly we ſhould be more
ſeverely treated than the Natural Subjects.</p>
            <p>The Year 1685 was ſuch an <hi>Epoche,</hi> that future Ages ſhall look
upon to be the moſt dreadful that hath happened. 'Twas in that
Year that the Temples throughout <hi>France</hi> were pull'd down, and
an univerſal diſperſion of the People into all parts of the Earth.
We indeed ſaw our Calamity haſtning apace; but we never thought
the Perſecution would be ſo ſharp, or that the Dragoons would have
thrown away common Humanity. Poſterity will hardly believe i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:40628:8"/>
'Twas at <hi>Eaſter</hi> in the ſame Year, that we began to ſee the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
of the Reformed Churches in <hi>France;</hi> thoſe who in the
Neighbouring Provinces had been forbid all publick Exerciſe of
their Religion, came crowding to us for the ſake of their Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
We that were the Miniſters of <hi>Orange,</hi> endeavour'd to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
'em under their Calamities, and both in our Sermons, and
more private Diſcourſes, incourag'd them to a Stedfaſtneſs and
Perſeverance in the Faith. From that time they brought Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
continually from all parts, to be Baptiz'd of us. 'Twas a ſight
which would move compaſſion, to ſee Fathers and Mothers bring
their Infants fifteen or twenty Leagues to be Baptiz'd, ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring
in the Journey. At <hi>Whitſontide</hi> we had yet greater Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
reſorted to <hi>Orange,</hi> than at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> for then they of <hi>Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock</hi>
alſo were forbid the Exerciſe of their Religion, together with
<hi>Cevennes, Vivarets, Dauphine,</hi> and <hi>Provence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Twas at this time that we heard of the terrible Perſecution at
<hi>Guienne,</hi> and of the barbarous Uſage of thoſe at <hi>Montauban:</hi> Till
then we had heard little of it, but we had now the News of it ſo
often confirm'd, that we could not doubt of it. Storms drive not
the Waves with more Fury, than this violent Perſecution threw
Troubles continually towards us, which at laſt ſwallow'd us up:
We now ſaw that we were encompaſt on every ſide by the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons;
they were now in <hi>Dauphine,</hi> as well as in <hi>Languedock;</hi> and
the ill News came atteſted by no leſs than ten or twelve thouſand
Souls who fled for Refuge in the <hi>Principality of Orange.</hi> 'Twas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a miſerable Spectacle to ſee ſuch numbers of poor People of
all Ages and Conditions, where we might read Calamity in their
faces, and their Diſcourſes taken up with the ſtory of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane
Cruelties they had felt in thoſe Provinces. Women ready
to be delivered, put to the fatigues of Travelling, Widows with
their little Children following them; Old Men afflicted by their
fears of the Dragoons more than by the inconveniences of Old
Age; we ſaw nothing but Objects of Compaſſion about <hi>Orange,</hi>
which gave us the afflicting ſenſe of their Miſeries, together with
a lively Repreſentation of the perſecuted condition which was
falling upon us. All this diſpoſed us to receive them with a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
Affection as became fellow-ſufferers, and comforting them
by thoſe excellent Diſcourſes which our Miniſters ſuited to their
Condition.</p>
            <p>The retreat of theſe poor People to <hi>Orange,</hi> drew down upon
us the Anger of the Governours who were at <hi>Montelimard: Mr.
de la Trouſſe, St. Ruth,</hi> and <hi>Teſſe</hi> caſt out againſt us violent Thret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40628:9"/>
we heard daily of their Diſcourſes in their Houſes, and
in the open Streets, that they would Plunder us, and pillage and
burn us: And in this temper they wrote to the Court, and did
aggravate every thing beyond the truth; and other ſtories they
ſent, that were down-right falſhoods; they inform'd the Court,
that there were ſixty Miniſters who fled thither, and who preach'd
in the open Streets; that they ſpoke reproachfully of the King,
and that in the Principality they would form a Rebellion. And
though theſe Diſcourſes had little appearances of truth in them,
yet the Council made an Advantage of them againſt us, and made
uſe of them as a pretence for their evil uſage of us; though 'tis
clear that theſe were not the Reaſons of their Cruelty, which,
as it may in part be diſcovered by what I have already ſaid, ſo
'tis too well known to the World, to need a more particular
Proof.</p>
            <p>Upon the <hi>11th.</hi> of <hi>October</hi> at Night we were all alarm'd; they
told us, the Dragoons were hard by our doors, and on a ſudden
there was nothing heard but Out-cries about the Town; all the
Inhabitants, as well of one as the other Religion, began to pack
up; every body was calling out for Carts and Horſes, to remove
their Goods into the <hi>Comtat.</hi> As much incommoded as I was by
my Indiſpoſition, I deſired ſeven or eight of our Citizens to get
on Horſe-back, and diſcover where abouts the Dragoons were:
They went with great haſt, and came back and told me, that
they had not found one Man, ſo that I thought we had made
a falſe Alarm. The worſt that befel us this Night, was the
great diſtreſs of thoſe who took Sanctuary with us; for they
were all upon the flight again, and run about where Providence
directed them; ſome into the Woods, which were filled with
theſe poor People, and to the <hi>Montagne,</hi> which is called the
<hi>Prince's,</hi> a frightful Deſart, which in a moment was turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a well-peopled place. They all now reſolved each Perſon to
go to his own Habitation, or to get out of the Kingdom.
That which occaſioned this Alarm, was a Letter which a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
wrote me from <hi>Paris,</hi> by which he informed me, that I
ought to look upon it as a thing certain, that it had been reſolved
of in Council, to ſend the Dragoons to <hi>Orange,</hi> to ſeize of thoſe
who had fled to us for Refuge, and to deal with us, as with the
reſt of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Whilſt we were under this Conſternation, our Parliament
thought they could not do better, than to put out a Decree,
which ſhould Command all Strangers within three days to go out
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40628:9"/>
of the Principality: For as they made this a pretence that <hi>Orange</hi>
received the King's rebellious Subjects; ſo by this Decree, we
might take away all occaſion of their falling upon us. Before this
Decree came out, we perſwaded thoſe few who were left among
us to retreat, leſt by being found here, they might draw upon
us the ſame misfortunes which they had felt: That to be plain
with them, they could not hope for any ſecurity among us, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
what was preparing for us; and that therefore they had
better contentedly to retire, than that we ſhould uſe forcible
means to make them, which would be a ſenſible grief to us;
And that we might not be wanting in any thing that might ſerve
us, we appointed two Gentlemen to wait upon the <hi>Duke de
Nouailles,</hi> and two more upon the Governours whom I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſpoken of, who were at <hi>Montelimard,</hi> to acquaint them with
the Decree of Parliament which had been publiſh'd.</p>
            <p>The Duke received them with great Civility, telling them, he
would write to Court about it, and that in the mean time he
could aſſure them they need not fear any thing, ſince the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
had proceeded in that manner. But thoſe who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
at <hi>Montelimar</hi> took another Method. The Marquiſs <hi>de
la Trouſſe</hi> continued his furious Language, and ſpoke of nothing
to our Deputies but hanging the Miniſters, and Interdicting the
whole Principality. 'Tis certain he knew the Court's mind, and
'twas upon that account that he ſpoke ſuch imperious and mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Language. The Deputies were no ſooner returned, but we
underſtood the <hi>Count de Grignan</hi> was come Poſt from Court, with
Orders concerning <hi>Orange.</hi> He came by the way of <hi>Taraſcon,</hi>
to take with him the Intendant of <hi>Provence,</hi> and two Companies
of Dragoons of the Ord'nance for his Guard. With this Train
he came to <hi>Orange Octob.</hi> 23. 1685. But before he made his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
he reſolv'd to ſhew himſelf a good Neighbour; for having
made a halt at <hi>Lieu de Bedarrides,</hi> he ſent the Captain of his
Guards to pray <hi>Mr. de Beaufain</hi> to aſſure the Inhabitants of <hi>Orange</hi>
that he was not coming to do them any Injury. The Captain
found the whole City alarm'd, and in a terrible fright, which
could not be quieted by all the Speeches which <hi>Mr. de Beaufain</hi>
took the pains to make from Street to Street. About Three in
the Afternoon the Count arrived there with the Intendant; they
took up their Quarters at the Biſhop's Palace, and the Dragoons
were billited in the Publick Houſes, where they continued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
committing any diſorders. After theſe Gentlemen had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
a while with the Biſhop, the <hi>Count de Grignan</hi> ſent for
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40628:10"/>
the Officers of the Court of the Revenue, of whom the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<hi>Mr. de Lubieres,</hi> is the Chief. He told them, he was ſent
thither by the King his Maſter, to ſignifie that his Majeſty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,
that they would cauſe thoſe of his Subjects, who had fled
into that Principality, to depart thence; that for the future, we
ſhould not receive them into our Churches, nor multiply any
more the exerciſes of our Religion, as we had done at the laſt
Sacrament in <hi>September,</hi> upon which Conditions we need not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the leaſt danger. To this <hi>Mr. de Lubieres</hi> anſwered, That
as for Entertaining the Refugiees, the Parliament had already
provided againſt it by their Decree, which he then preſented to
him; that his Majeſty's Subjects were already retired thence, and
that if any yet remained, their number was was very inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
that they would cauſe another Decree to be publiſh'd,
purporting that thoſe who were yet left, ſhould depart the State
in three days. Upon this, the Intendant took occaſion to tell
the Count, theſe Gentlemen have acted very fairly, 'tis fit we
ſhould do ſo too, and allow eight days time to the Refugiees to
retire in. To the Point concerning the Exerciſes of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
'twas anſwer'd, that our Church being now reduced to its
former number, there would be no neceſſity of multiplying the
uſe of them. This Conference paſs'd very amicably on both
ſides, with all the ſigns of a very good Correſpondence. But
here I muſt intreat the Reader to take notice, with what ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
we proceeded with them in this Affair. The <hi>Count de Grignan</hi>
and the Intendant aſſure us, as from the Court, that if we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
what the King deſired, we need not fear any danger: The
Prince's Officers promiſe to do ſo, and perform that Promiſe;
but alas! how have they kept their Word to us? For there had
not paſs'd twenty four hours, but it was violated in a moſt exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable
manner, and ſuch as muſt needs ſtrike all my Readers with
horror. However I muſt needs ſay for the <hi>Count de Grignan,</hi>
that he acted like a Man of Honour; he ſpoke ſincerely, as
being not privy to the Court-Intrigue, and he ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
his diſſatisfaction for being made an Inſtrument to bring a
Promiſe, which has been ſo ill obſerved.</p>
            <p>This Conference of his Highneſs's Officers with thoſe of his
Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, cauſed an extream Joy in the Reform'd
Inhabitants of the Principality. They mutually congratulated
their Happineſs, as thinking the Aſſurances given them would
have been made good; and gave Thanks to God, that it had
pleaſed him (though they were no better than their Brethren)
to divert the fury of that approaching Tempeſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:40628:10"/>
In this pleaſing Imagination, that they would let us be quiet,
we ſlept ſecurely in our Beds; it ſeem'd that our paſt Inquietudes
were as an eaſie Cradle to rock us aſleep: But it was ſoon inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by the ſad News which was brought me at Three a Clock
in the Morning. For it happened that one of my Neighbours
as he was going out of the City, was ſtopt and turned back by
a <hi>Corps de Gard</hi> of Dragoons. He knock'd at my Door, which
my Servants opened, and came into my Chamber all pale, and
in a panick fear, telling me we were all undone, that above a
Thouſand Dragoons had begirt the City, not ſuffering any of the
Inhabitants to go out; and indeed the <hi>Count de Teſſe</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
ſuch Orders from Court, had commanded the Queen's
Regiment of Dragoons, and <hi>Du Pleſſis Believre</hi>'s Regiment of Foot
to repair inſtantly to <hi>Paul trois Chateaux,</hi> four Leagues from <hi>Orange;</hi>
theſe Troops were no ſooner come to their Rendezvous, but they
were commanded to march at the beginning of the Night, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
knowing whither they were to go. They came to the Bridge
of <hi>Aigues</hi> an hour after Midnight, and by the way meeting his
Highneſs's Courrier, who was carrying Letters to St. <hi>Eſprit,</hi> they
ſtopt him, and took away his Packet. The Commander of the
Party cauſed a Candle to be lighted, and unſeal'd the Orders
which he had received from the <hi>Count de Teſſe,</hi> and having read
them, took his march to <hi>Orange,</hi> and diſpatch'd ſome Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
to go and inveſt the Towns of <hi>Courtheſon</hi> and <hi>Jonquieres.</hi>
He approached the City without being diſcovered, and poſted
his <hi>Corps de Gardes</hi> and Sentries very near each other, before any
of the City had notice of it. My Neighbour, whom I before
mentioned, was the firſt that gave the Alarm; every one ſtarted
out of their Beds, endeavouring to ſave themſelves by all paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
out of the City, but the Souldiers were placed at ſo near a
diſtance, that only ſome few who had moſt courage durſt ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to get through. I leave others to imagine the cries and
ſhrieks of the poor Inhabitants; as remote as I was from the
Street, their Lamentations pierced my very Heart; and thoſe
Torrents of Tears which my poor Sheep came to pour out in
my Chamber, put me into the condition of a dying Man. At
break of Day the <hi>Count de Teſſe</hi> entred the City, attended by
ſeveral Officers, breathing out nothing but Puniſhments, Blood,
and Slaughter, which augmented the Conſternation of thoſe of
the Religion. After having marched about the ſtreets to ſtrike
Terror by his barbarous Expreſſions, intermixed with horrid
Execrations, he alighted at the Biſhop's Palace, the common Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40628:11"/>
of all thoſe who came to <hi>Orange</hi> to Oppreſs us. The
Companies of Dragoons who were gone to Inveſt <hi>Courtheſon</hi> and
<hi>Jonquieres,</hi> had made terrible work there. In the latter they had
ſeiz'd a Rich Inhabitant, named <hi>Garaignon,</hi> whom they had pinion'd,
and made him march before them in that condition quite to
<hi>Orange.</hi> At <hi>Courtheſon</hi> they took <hi>Mr. Aunet,</hi> Paſtor of that Church,
and made him go in the Head of a Party of Dragoons, who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
him to the <hi>Count de Teſſe,</hi> by whom he was immediately ſent
to Priſon. My dear Collegues, <hi>Meſſieurs Gondrand, Chion,</hi> and
<hi>Petit,</hi> had attempted before day to make their eſcape, but being
forced back by the Guards, who fired at them, and <hi>Mr. Villet,</hi>
Miniſter of <hi>Provence,</hi> who yet was ſo lucky to get away, they
went to abſcond in ſome of their Friends Houſes. At Three in
the Afternoon the <hi>Count de Teſſe</hi> required to ſpeak with the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
and for that purpoſe ſent ſome Officers to ſearch for
them at their Houſes. They brought him word, that they had
found no body but me, who was not able to ſtir-in my Bed for
the extream pain of the Gout and my broken Thigh. This Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
put him into a terrible Fury, whileſt he was ſtudying
where it ſhould be that my Collegues had ſecur'd themſelves.
This grand Converter ſpoke of nothing but demoliſhing our
Churches, and ruining the City, if the Miniſters were not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd.
Theſe Menaces did ſo terrifie our People, that inſtead
of concealing their Paſtors, as thoſe of <hi>Alexandria</hi> did once in
the caſe of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> they were the firſt to ſearch for them, in
order to their bringing them before the <hi>Count de Teſſe,</hi> hoping
thereby to appeaſe the rage of that furious Perſecutor, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
that they ſhould thereby rather add to the weight of their
Perſecution.</p>
            <p>But for as much as we had mutually promiſed to ſacrifice our
ſelves for our Flocks, my bleſſed Collegues came out of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements,
and notwithſtanding the Tears of their Wives and
Children, who begg'd of them not to expoſe themſelves, as they
were going to do, went to wait upon the <hi>Count de Teſſe,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
them with threats of ſending them to the Gallows, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<hi>Mr. Petit,</hi> whom he told poſitively, that he ſhould be
hang'd the next day. He had ſcarce patience to ſuffer them one
moment in his preſence, before he ſent them to Priſon, without
being ſo civil as to hear them ſay one word in their own defence.
Theſe faithful Servants of God were no ſooner committed, but
the Count ſent an Officer with two Dragoons to my Houſe, one
of which he poſted by my Bed-ſide, telling him, his Life ſhould
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40628:11"/>
anſwer for my Appearance; and the other at the Door of my
Houſe, to hinder any from coming to me. When I ſaw my ſelf
under this Confinement, I lifted up my Heart to God in a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
Prayer, imploring the aſſiſtance of his Grace to ſupport me
in this Conflict, to perfect his ſtrength in my weakneſs, and that
he might be glorified, whether by my Life or Death. I can
aver with a ſafe Conſcience, that though I was in ſuch deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Condition, I did not ſo much reflect upon my own Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
as thoſe of my dear Collegues, and my poor Flock. I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
my Wife, Mrs. <hi>Louiſe de Chavanon,</hi> my Nephews, and
others of my Relations, that could be near me, to give me their
Aſſiſtance, and not to diſcourage me by their Tears, telling them,
that in that miſerable eſtate to which my Pains and Afflictions
had reduced me, we ought all of us rather to Arm our ſelves to
fight together that good Fight, and to defend the precious Pledge
of our Faith, which God had put into our hands; that as to my
own particular, my truſt in God was ſo ſtrong, that I was firmly
perſuaded, that neither Death, nor Life, nor Perſecution, nor
Nakedneſs, nor the Sword could ever ſeparate me from his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
love. That I fore-ſaw that I ſhould be treated with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treameſt
Rigor, as well for Reaſons of State, as upon account of
Religion; but whatever happened, I found I had Courage enough
to endure the utmoſt Cruelties they could inflict upon me.
But alas! I have found by too ſad Experience, that the ſtouteſt
Heart cannot bear up if it be not ſtrengthened by the invincible
power of Grace, and that our ſtrongeſt Reſolutions are but vain
Illuſions, when they have no better Foundation than meer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in our ſelves.</p>
            <p>When they had ſecur'd me and my Collegues, they diſmiſs'd
the Guard which they had planted round the City, into which
the Dragoons made their entry as into a place conquer'd. They
Quarter'd one third part of them upon the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> and the
other two thirds upon thoſe of the Religion. You may more
eaſily conceive than I can expreſs the outrages committed from
that Night forward. All that Barbarity and Violence could ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
to them, was employed in tormenting my poor Flock. 'Tis
true, their Fury for ſeventeen days was not altogether ſo great;
and <hi>Teſſe</hi> gave out, that his Buſineſs there was not to make us
change our Religion; but yet he placed his Guards at all the
Avenues of the City, to hinder any body from going out.—He
was pleaſed likewiſe to remove the Dragoon that was placed in
my Chamber, being informed of the ſad condition I was in, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40628:12"/>
that there was no fear I ſhould make my eſcape, the misfortune
I lay under being a heavier Chain than all the Irons they could
have loaded me with.—The Biſhop gave me to underſtand by
a Perſon that was ſent to me, that I was obliged to him for thoſe
petty Favours, and I returned him my Thanks for the ſame. But
for all that, the Door of my Houſe was guarded by Sentinels that
were relieved every hour; and there were but a very few ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to enter.—The Guard that <hi>was placed in my Chamber</hi> incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded
me extreamly, hindring me from diſcourſing freely with
thoſe Perſons that ſtood in need of Comfort. But when he was
removed, I had the Opportunity of conferring with ſeveral that
came to me a private way the Dragoons knew not of.—The
day after the Arrival of theſe cruel Perſecutors, being the <hi>26th.</hi>
of <hi>October,</hi> came the firſt Batallion of <hi>Du Pleſſis Believre</hi> about Two
in the Afternoon, and was followed the day after by the ſecond.
The great number of the Souldiers obliged <hi>Count de Teſſe</hi> to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
the Inhabitants with thoſe new Gueſts; who, though they
had extraordinary Pay, <hi>viz.</hi> the Dragoons 30, and the Infantry
<hi>10 Sous</hi> a day, yet for all that, they forced their Landlords to
give them Free Quarter: And Happy was he that was forced
only with dry blows to grant them what they demanded.</p>
            <p>No ſooner was the firſt Batallion come, but the <hi>Count de Teſſe</hi>
ſent the Major of the Regiment, accompanied with the Biſhop's
Secretary, to me, to demand the Keys of our Churches. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
him, that I was not the Church-Warden. This Anſwer
put him into a Paſſion; and he told me, he had Orders to receive
the Keys from my own Hands. I reply'd again, that I was not
the Church-Warden; and that it was in vain for him to expect
that I ſhould deliver him them. Then he began again to uſe
Threatning Language to oblige me to do what he required. But
finding me, after all, firm to my Reſolution, he ordered ſome
of the Souldiers to go and ſee for the Church-Warden; and they
not finding him, made one of his Daughters come along with
them to me with the Keys in her Hand. The poor Girle came
into my Chamber all in Tears. The Major ordered the Maid to
deliver the Keys to me; but I refuſed to receive them. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me in the <hi>Count de Teſſe</hi>'s Name to take them, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them to him. I abſolutely refuſed to do either the one or
the other. At laſt, after a Debate of about a quarter of an hour,
he ſnatch'd them out of the Maid's Hand, and went to tell the
<hi>Count de Teſſe</hi> what he had done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:40628:12"/>
The Count in the mean time tarry'd at the Gate of the great
Church, impatiently expecting the Keys; and as ſoon as he got
them, he entred the Church, accompanied by the Biſhop, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
by way of Deriſion, <hi>Farewel, poor Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt thing thoſe honeſt Gentlemen did in that Holy Place,
was to tear in pieces the Bibles, and the Pſalm-Books. Then
they went up into the Pulpit, where they uttered a thouſand
profane Expreſſions. After that, they tore down his Highneſs's
Arms, which were placed over the Parliament-Seat. And in
fine, they ſhewed themſelves ſo Inhumane, as to do violence
even to the Aſhes of the great <hi>Chriſtopher, Count de Dona,</hi> that
were repoſited in that Sacred Structure, which by his means had
been built by Order, and at the Charge of the great Prince <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drick-Henry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reader I hope will excuſe me for not relating all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities
they put in practice to profane our Churches, which
fills me with ſo great a horror, that my Soul even ſinks under it.
It will ſuffice to tell him, that they ran to the Poors Box to take
away the Money, and finding but little there, they diſcharged
there Fury upon Mrs. <hi>Chion,</hi> my Collegue's Wife, whom they
ſent to Priſon. The next day they began to take away the Seats,
ſome of which they carried to the Cathedral, and the reſt to the
Chappels of the Convents: Then they proceeded to the pulling
down the little Church, called the Church of St. <hi>Martin.</hi> The
Curè did what he could to hinder it, alledging it belonged to
his Cure, but he could not be heard; ſo it was razed down to
the ground. But I muſt not omit to tell one thing very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
of a Souldier, who being of the Religion, choſe rather to
be cudgell'd in a moſt cruel manner, and dragg'd along the ſtreets,
than to aſſiſt at the pulling down of it; telling his Captain, he
would ſooner die, than obey him in ſuch an unjuſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
            <p>This Church was no ſooner demoliſh'd, but theſe Deſtroying
Angels ſet about reducing the other to a heap of Stones. This
was a very ſpacious one, and of an admirable Structure; the
Roof was ſupported by an Arch carried from Weſt, on which
ſide ſtood the Pulpit, to Eaſt, having on the right and left a
Range of three Arches of Free-ſtone, with their Corniſhes, which
ſupported the Galleries, to receive the Rain-water falling on the
Roof, which was conveyed away. They ſpent fourteen days in
pulling down this Fabrick, and not being able to looſen the more
ſolid parts of it with Levers, nor any other Inſtruments, they were
neceſſitated to blow it up.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:40628:13"/>
At the ſame time they were at work in demoliſhing the Church
at <hi>Courtheſon,</hi> and the Dragoons tormented the Inhabitants with a
thouſand Outrages which they committed upon thoſe poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who being eat out of all, as well as thoſe of <hi>Orange,</hi> were
not able to provide any longer for the ſubſiſtance of the Souldiers.
In the mean time my Collegues were kept very cloſe Priſoners
with two other Miniſters, <hi>Meſſieurs Rainaud,</hi> and <hi>De Vignoles;</hi>
the former of which they had ſeized in <hi>Dauphine,</hi> and the latter
in the Province of <hi>Languedoc.</hi> Very few Perſons were permitted
to viſit them; but we ſent each other little Notes, to encourage
us to fight the good Fight, and to defend our Religion, though
with the hazard of our Lives. But though theſe little Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of mutual Correſpondence gave us ſome little Joy and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation,
we had every day ſome new ſubject of Affliction. The
poor people that were miſerably harraſs'd, and could not bear
the great expence which they muſt lie under, of maintaining
the Dragoons, did moſt ſhamefully abate in their Zeal. I ſent
as many as I poſſibly could to confirm them; and gave my ſelf
no reſpite neither night nor day from performing the Duty of
my Miniſtry, and Praying with all thoſe that came to my Houſe.
But at laſt, God, who intended to puniſh us for our hainous ſins,
ſuffered us to ſee thoſe ſad days, being wholly forſaken by our
Flocks, except only ſome few particular Perſons, who, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all the Cruelties that could be exerciſed upon them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
firm to the laſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>November</hi> the <hi>10th.</hi> in the Morning it was publickly reported,
that an Expreſs was come to the <hi>Count de Teſſe,</hi> with Orders, that
he ſhould execute the Booted Miſſion, <hi>i.e.</hi> that he ſhould Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
us without Mercy, to make us change our Religion. I have
by a woful Experience obſerved, that the Aſſembles that have
been made at <hi>Montaban, Montpellier, Nimes, Uſez,</hi> and all the
other conſiderable Cities, to Conſult what was to be done upon
like Occaſions, have been Snares, which thoſe unhappy Perſons
who have been drawn away, have laid for the ſimple, as likewiſe
for thoſe of better Judgments, to make them alſo fall with the
Croud. This made me take all poſſible care that my Flock might
not be drawn into the ſame Snare: 'Twas for that Reaſon, that
the day before I had deſired <hi>Mr. Grenatier</hi> my Kinſman, who was
one of thoſe happy Perſons, that, notwithſtanding a thouſand
Dangers he muſt meet with, and as many Difficulties he was to
run through in making his eſcape out of the Kingdom, yet ſtill
preſerved his Religion. 'Twas, I ſay, upon an apprehenſion of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40628:13"/>
this, that I pray'd him to go all about the City, and engage the
Inhabitants to decline all ſuch Aſſemblies, whatſoever might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
thereupon, aſſuring them, that contrivances of ruining them
by ſuch means would certainly be made uſe of; and that all ſorts
of fair Promiſes would be made them, but nothing of thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
would be afterwards obſerved. And though he acquitted
himſelf in that Affair with abundance of Zeal and Diligence, yet
the ſucceſs did not anſwer our pains, as we ſhall ſhew hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Teſſe</hi> was at the <hi>Count du Suzes</hi> Houſe, about three Leagues
from <hi>Orange</hi> when the Expreſs arrived. He came immediately,
and begun an open Perſecution, by removing the Souldiers that
were quartered upon the <hi>Romaniſts:</hi> And all the Troops were
billetted only upon thoſe of the Religion. And no ſooner was
this new aſſignment of Quarters made, but a thouſand doleful
Cries were every where to be heard in the City; the People run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
up and down the Streets all in tears. The Wife cry'd out
for help to Reſcue her Husband, whom they were either cruelly
cudgelling about, or hanging up <hi>by the heels</hi> in the Chimney, or
tying to the Bed's-feet, or threatning immediately to cut his
Throat. The Husband implor'd the like aſſiſtance in behalf of
his Wife, whom threats and blows, and a thouſand ſorts of
Cruelties had made to miſcarry. The Children cryed out, Help,
Help! They are Murthering my Father, they are Raviſhing my
Mother, and ſpitting one of my Brothers.—But here I
muſt ſtop my Pen, which is ready to drop out of my Hand, and
the very remembrance of their Barbarities has ſo over-whelmed
me with grief and tears, that I am not able to proceed in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing
that Tragical Scene. From thoſe Cruelties neither Sex
nor Age was exempt. Nor was there any more regard had to
Perſons of the greateſt Worth, or of the beſt Families, than to
the meaneſt Peaſants. Nor had they any Reſpect to the Prince's
Officers, but even <hi>Monſieur de Lubieres, Monſieur d'Alencon,</hi> and
<hi>Monſieur de Drevon</hi> were forced to receive Dragoons into their
Houſes. And it was well for my Nephew, <hi>Mr. Convenent,</hi> who
was Chancellor of Parliament, that he got away early that
Morning in a Country-man's Habit, that ſo while it was in his
power, he might make his eſcape out of the Kingdom: For I
do not doubt, but that barely for his Relation to me, he would
have been worſe uſed than all his Collegues.</p>
            <p>The ſame day about Four in the Afternoon, the <hi>Count de Teſſe</hi>
came along with the Biſhop to my Houſe; he came into my
Chamber, where, having lately broke my Thigh, I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40628:14"/>
confin'd to my Bed, having not been able to riſe but only
twice to have my Bed made. He ſaluted me very civilly, and
ask'd me kindly concerning the ſtate of my Health. And after
he had plac'd himſelf at the Head of the Bed, and the Biſhop
at the Feet, he began to tell me, that he had a great concern
for me, and that he had ſhewn me a particular favour above my
Collegues, in not throwing me into Priſon, as knowing that I
was a Gentleman, and that he had ſeen none elſe in the City,
but <hi>Monſieur de Beaufain</hi> and my ſelf to perſwade to comply with
the King's Commands. And that the better to prevail with me,
he had brought along with him Monſieur the Biſhop, that if I
had any ſcruples of Conſcience, he might give me ſatisfaction
therein. I return'd him my Thanks for his Kindneſs, and ſaid
to this effect, That I had a Maſter in Heaven, whom I ought
chiefly to obey; and that as for a Soveraign upon Earth, I own'd
none other but his Highneſs the <hi>Prince of Orange;</hi> that I was born
his Subject, and had the Honour to be one of his Domeſticks;
that as for Monſieur the Biſhop, we were well acquainted, and
had been good Friends, and had never had any Diſpute about
Religion, and that now, when ſo many Swords were drawn to
defend the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, and to extirpate the Reformed, it
would be to no purpoſe to enter the Liſts with him. He was
very importunate with me to enter into Diſcourſe. If, ſaid he,
you will not engage with the Biſhop, pray tell me, for my own
ſatisfaction, why you abhor Images ſo much, and what is the
Reaſon you will not come over to our Communion? Sir, reply'd
I, ſince you will have me ſpeak my Mind, I will tell you, that
in order to the Re-union you ſpeak of, the <hi>Prelates</hi> of <hi>France</hi> are
to puſh the Point which they contend for ſomewhat further.
The condemning the four Propoſitions ſeems to have ſomewhat
that is good in it, or at leaſt we make this Advantage of it, that
they agree with us in this particular, that the Pope is not the
Infallible Judge of Controverſies; which is a Point we all along
eagerly contended for againſt the Pretences of the Jeſuites, and
the Monks. After ſo hopeful a beginning, we expect that the
Gentlemen of the Glergy ſhould proceed to Reform the manner
of Worſhip, as now practiſed in the Church; for really we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
look upon it but as unlawful in it ſelf. They ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to do as <hi>Serenus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Marſeilles</hi> did, who coming into
his Church, and ſeeing it curiouſly adorned with exquiſite Statues
and Pictures, ordered thoſe Objects of Idolatry to be removed,
and made every the ſmalleſt Piece to be defaced. And if the Pope
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40628:14"/>
ſhould ſend his Letters to reproach them for it, as <hi>Gregory</hi> the
Great formerly did to <hi>Serenus;</hi> and that they ſhould at leaſt have
ſpared the Paintings, which might have ſerved as ſo many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructors
to the Illiterate. They may anſwer him, as that great
Biſhop did to <hi>Gregory,</hi> that he had no need of ſuch petty Doctors
to make Men groſs Idolaters, and that he, the true Paſtor of his
Flock, was ſufficient to ſhew them how they were to Worſhip
God. Well, anſwered <hi>Monſieur de Teſſe,</hi> but do you believe we
adore the Images? That is not the thing we are to conſider, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
I; 'tis enough that you give them a Religious Worſhip.
Your Biſhops ſhould therefore follow the Example of St. <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
who going to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> upon his entrance into an Oratory,
tore a Veil that had upon it the Picture of a certain Saint. Till
then, the Biſhop had kept ſilence, but then he interpoſed, ſaying,
That that was the Picture of a Robber. Then I began to ſmile,
ſaying, that ſuch an Evaſion would have come well enough
from a Jeſuite, but I could not but wonder, that ſuch an eminent
Prelate as he ſhould ſhuffle over this action of St. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> with
a Fiction ſo very ill contrived. You, Sir, ſaid I, being ſo very
well verſed in Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, I am ſurprized that you
ſhould not have taken Notice of the Epiſtle which St. <hi>Epiphanius</hi>
wrote to <hi>John,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which St. <hi>Jerome</hi> has Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated
out of <hi>Greek</hi> into <hi>Latin,</hi> and is his one hundred and firſt
Epiſtle to <hi>Pammachius,</hi> where it is ſaid expreſly, that 'twas the
Picture of Chriſt, or elſe ſome Saint, not particularly remembring
whether it was the one or the other. The <hi>Count de Teſſe</hi> would
not permit us to diſpute any longer upon that Subject, but asked
me, why we would not uſe Confeſſion? No doubt, Sir, ſaid I,
you underſtand <hi>Latin,</hi> hear therefore what St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Quid
mihi cum hominibus ut peccata mea audiant tanquam Morbos meos ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturi,</hi>
What have I to do to confeſs my ſins to Men, as if they
were able to heal the Diſeaſes of my Soul? Then he led me into
a Diſcourſe about <hi>Purgatory,</hi> ſaying, that it was highly neceſſary
that our Souls ſhould be purged, and prepared to appear in the
Preſence of God. I anſwered, That that was to be done by our
Saviour's Blood; and that in ſhort, Purgatory was nothing elſe
but a meer Fiction, whereof there was not ſo much as one word
ſpoken in the Primitive Church. And, Sir, ſaid I, I will leave
you to judge whether St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> believed a Purgatory, when I
have recited a few words of his; <hi>Primum locum fides catholicorum
credit eſſe Regnum Coelorum, ſecundum Gehennam ubi omnis Apoſtata
aut à fide deficiens cruciatur, tertium penitùs ignoramus, neque in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40628:15"/>
Scripturis eſſe invenimus.</hi> The word <hi>Penitùs,</hi> added I, is very
emphatical, and does ſo expreſly exclude Purgatory, that if you
conſider it well, you will not believe any ſuch Place.</p>
            <p>When the Count ſaw me ſo Reſolute to maintain the Truth,
he chang'd his way of Aſſaulting me; he told me, the King his
Maſter made it a point of Honour to make me a Catholick; and
therefore I ought to conſider with my ſelf, and to accept thoſe
Terms he was going to offer me. You have nothing to do, ſaid
he, but only to draw up in Writing whatſoever you deſire, and
I have Commiſſion to grant it you. Here is Monſieur the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
who knows, and is ready to atteſt it. I anſwer'd him, that
I knew very well that ſo great a Prince, as the King his Maſter,
would not have any ſuch concern for ſo inconſiderable a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
as I was. That as for the reſt, I had no need of any thing;
and that all the Favour I deſired of him, was, that he would
pleaſe to grant me a Paſs, as he had given to the Miniſters of
<hi>France,</hi> that I might retire to my Great Maſter in <hi>Holland.</hi> He
immediately broke out into high <hi>Elogiums</hi> upon the Prince, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that he had a particular Veneration for his extraordinary
Merits, that he highly admired him as a great Hero, and that he
had upon ſeveral Occaſions ſeen him behave himſelf both as a
brave Souldier, and a great General. If, Sir, ſaid I, you have
ſuch a Veneration for that great Prince, I beſeech you have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
upon his Servant, and grant me a Paſs, that I may repair
to him, which would be a great Comfort to me in my preſent
afflicted Condition. That, reply'd he, is not in my Power; I
have told you already, that the King makes it a Point of Honour
to Convert you. It is very well known that you are a dangerous
Perſon, and too much devoted to the Prince; you will never be
ſuffered to go to him. How, ſaid I, muſt my Fidelity to my
Great Maſter be charged upon me as a Crime, to detain me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to all Right? It is to no purpoſe to Argue, reply'd he in a
Rage; you muſt obey the King, otherwiſe I ſhall proceed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
my Order againſt you. You dare not do it, ſaid I. How,
Sir, ſaid he, (approaching my Bed with a Countenance flaming
with Rage) dare not do it? Yes, Sir, ſaid I, I ſay again, You
dare not execute your Orders upon me. And then uncovering
my ſelf, I let him ſee my wretched Body, ſaying, Conſider, Sir,
this Carkaſs; your Compaſſion and Generoſity will not let you
execute any Cruelty upon it. Adieu, Sir, ſaid he, you are too
Rhetorical for me. I bid you a third time conſider of it, and
obey the King, or elſe it will be worſe for you. I told him, that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40628:15"/>
I had conſidered every thing that I ought to conſider; I ſee that
Pity is a Vertue that is not in faſhion now adays. I ſhall with
ſatisfaction ſee my ſelf dragged along the ſtreets of <hi>Orange.</hi> The
Biſhop tarried a little time after in my Chamber; he deſired me
not to ſuffer my ſelf to be Tormented, adding, that he bore a
part in my Misfortune; and leaning himſelf down upon me, he
embraced me with Tears, which I believed came from his very
Heart. From my Houſe theſe Gentlemen went to the Priſons:
The Count had given Orders that my Collegues ſhould be kept
apart, and that they ſhould be put into deep Dungeons. He
viſited them one after another, perſwading them to turn: Yet
notwithſtanding all the Threats that the Count could uſe, they
remained firm and undaunted; and by the Piety of their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
they ſent away the Count and the Biſhop very much
aſhamed, that they had ſucceeded no better in their Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
This Example of Conſtancy, which both my Collegues
and I had given thoſe under our Care, ſhould have confirmed
them in a Reſolution of ſuffering any thing, rather than quit the
pure Profeſſion of the Goſpel. Several Perſons that were in my
Cloſet, heard all that paſt between the Count, the Biſhop, and
my ſelf; and my Diſcourſe with them was related all the Town
over, as were likewiſe thoſe of my Collegues. But we had the
misfortune to ſee that they proved not ſo effectual as we deſired.
The ſenſe of what they already ſuffered, and the apprehenſion
of what they were further to expect, prevailed with the people
to Aſſemble. God forgive thoſe that occaſioned that Aſſembly,
and who voted ſo wickedly therein. 'Tis true indeed, before
any thing was concluded, a Counſellor of Parliament and an
Advocate were diſpatched to <hi>Count de Teſſe,</hi> to Remonſtrate the
Injuſtice of forcing his Highneſs's Subjects to change their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
and to pray him to grant Paſs-ports to as many as had a
mind to leave their Country. But they got no other Anſwer
than a poſitive Denyal, and ſevere Menaces. Which when they
had reported to the Aſſembly, they reſolved upon a change of
their Religion upon Terms agreed to by the Biſhop, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
in theſe following Articles.</p>
            <q>
               <l>That they ſhould not be obliged to Pray to Saints.</l>
               <l>That they ſhould not be required to kneel-before Images. <hi>And</hi>
               </l>
               <l>That the Sacrament ſhould be given to them in both kinds.</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:40628:16"/>
Together with ſome more ſweeting Conceſſions, which I do
not particularly remember. Thus theſe poor unhappy Creatures
ſuffered themſelves in the Agony of their Minds to be trepann'd
by thoſe fair Promiſes, not conſidering that whether they
would or no, they ſhould ſhortly be brought to kneel before an
Image, and in every particular to Conform themſelves to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi>
way of Worſhip.</p>
            <p>All this while I underſtood nothing of this Aſſembly. There
were ſome Devout Perſons with me, who were come to Pray
with my Family. I read to them the <hi>Lamentations of Jeremiah;</hi> and
as we were joyntly bewailing the Ruin of our Church, we were
interrupted in that Holy Exerciſe by ſome that came to acquaint
me with what had paſs'd. Upon theſe ſad Tydings we redoubled
our ſighs and our tears. I made a Prayer for the Aſſiſtance and
Protection of Heaven in that Extremity: For I was ready to
expire with Grief, as plainly fore-ſeeing that that Aſſembly
could produce nothing but the Apoſtacy of my Flock. I ſent
every where to get my Elders together; but the buſineſs was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
concluded, and all my Arguments to no purpoſe. No
ſooner was that unhappy Re-union ſigned, but Orders were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the Dragoons to live peaceably in the Houſes of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Converts: But as for thoſe that remained ſtedfaſt, they
were grievouſly harraſs'd by the Souldiers.</p>
            <p>And now came my turn to bear the Fury of theſe mercileſs
Perſecutors. The <hi>Count de Teſſe</hi> had threatned to treat me with
Severity, and he was in that particular as good as his word: For
without being touched with any ſenſe of that ſad Condition he
ſaw me in, within two hours he ſent to my Houſe 42 Dragoons,
and 4 Drummers, who beat Night and Day about my Chamber,
to put me paſt ſleeping, and, if poſſible, to make me ſubmit.
Theſe new Gueſts crouded into my Chamber to demand Monies
of me, having one Towel tyed about their Heads inſtead of a
Cap, and another about their Arms, to wipe their hands with.—
To have given them every thing they asked for, you muſt have
gone to all the Cooks-ſhops in the City. For if when they had
gorg'd themſelves with the moſt delicious Fowl, that did no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
pleaſe their Palat, they would call for ſuch Rarities, as only
the <hi>Indies</hi> can furniſh, and all this only for a pretence, that they
might abuſe my Servants, and good Neighbours, that were come
to wait upon them, thinking thereby to mollifie their extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
Fury. In a few hours my Houſe was turn'd topſy-turvy:
All the Proviſions I had would not ſerve for one Meal, they
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40628:16"/>
broke open the doors to ſearch for whatever they found lock'd,
and made havock of all they lay'd hands upon. My Wife en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to oppoſe it with an undaunted Courage, but her
greateſt care was how to preſerve me, being afraid every time
ſhe came to me, leſt the Dragoons ſhould do me ſome miſchief.
She ſuffered from them all imaginable Inſolencies, Threatnings,
and opprobious Names, as Whore, Jade, and a thouſand other
filthy Expreſſions, which theſe wicked wretches belch'd out every
moment. The fear I was in leſt they ſhould grow more abuſive,
made me conjure her to retire to her Father, <hi>Mr. Chavanon</hi>'s
Houſe. She refuſed a long time to comply with me, but at
length being overcome by my Tears, ſhe yielded to my Requeſt.
No ſooner was Night come, but the Dragoons lighted up Candles
all over my Houſe. In my Court-yard, and all my Chambers you
might have ſeen as at Noon-day; and the ordinary employment
of thoſe Ruffians all Night was, to eat, drink, and ſmoak. This
would have been tolerable if they had not come into my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to intoxicate and choak me with the Fumes of their Tobacco,
and the Drummers would but have ceas'd their horrid din, and
have let me taken ſome reſt. But theſe Inhumane Monſters
were not contented to diſturb me in that manner, but added to
it moſt hideous yellings: And if by good chance the Fumes of
their Wine laid any of them aſleep, the Officer that commanded
them, who, they ſaid, was nearly related to the Marqueſs <hi>de
Louvois,</hi> ſoon wak'd them with the Diſcipline of his Cane, that
they might torment me afreſh. What could I do in the midſt of
that Hell upon Earth, but only lift up my Soul to God to beg
his gracious Aſſiſtance? That was my only Employment, which
I accompany'd with my ſighs and tears. Theſe Torments had ſo
deprav'd the Conſtitution of my Body, that I was not able to
take any Nouriſhment. I received no conſolation from any
body but my Wife, who came from time to time from her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Houſe to comfort me in my Miſery. The Doors were ſhut
againſt every body but two <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> who being touched
with Compaſſion at my cruel Uſage, hazarded themſelves, to
come and lend me their help. Some of my Flock, who had
yielded under the Perſecution, found means, I know not how,
to ſlip into my Houſe: They came into my Chamber, and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves upon the Ground at my Bed-ſide, conjur'd me to
pray to God for them, that their Iniquity might not be laid to
their charge. It will not, ſaid I, burſting into Tears, my dear
Children, if you recover again by a ſpeedy Repentance; <hi>for there
is mercy with God, that he may be feared.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:40628:17"/>
Having got over this ill Night, the <hi>Count de Teſſe</hi> ſent an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer
to ask me, whether I would obey the <hi>King.</hi> I anſwer'd him,
that I would obey <hi>God.</hi> Upon this, the Officer went haſtily out
of my Chamber, and Order was given to Quarter the whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
upon me, and to torment me with greater violence. All
this Day and the Night following the diſturbance was intolerable.
The Drums beat in my Chamber, the Dragoons ſmoak'd their
Tobacco in my Face, and what through this infernal Smoak, want
of Food and Sleep, and the pains I ſuffer'd, my Mind was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.
And yet in the midſt of all theſe Torments, I ſenſibly
felt the Grace of <hi>God</hi> ſuſtaining me. I was once more ſummon'd
by the ſame Officer to obey the <hi>King.</hi> I anſwer'd, that <hi>God</hi> was
my <hi>King,</hi> and that I ſhould ſoon appear before him to give an
Account of my Actions; and that they would do much better
to diſpatch me, than to make me languiſh under ſo many Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manities.
All this did not in the leaſt ſoften their barbarous hearts,
but made them a great deal worſe; ſo that being thus oppreſs'd
with ſuch a load of Perſecutions, on <hi>Tueſday,</hi> the <hi>13th.</hi> of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
I fell into a Trance, in which I remain'd four hours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat,
with ſmall appearance of Life. The noiſe of this ſoon
ſpread ever all the City; the people run in crouds to my Houſe,
and ſeveral Ladies forced their way through the Dragoons, to give
me Aſſiſtance in this extremity: And 'twas even reported, that I
was dead. My Flock prais'd God for my deliverance, and for
taking me away in the midſt of my Troubles, out of the hands
of my Enemies. The Dragoons came into my Room, and ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inſulted over me; one brought a another a Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
and the reſt brought Joynts of Mutton, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and mocking,
ſaid, We muſt rub his Teeth with theſe, and he'll come to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
The noiſe of my Death was quickly carried to the <hi>Count
de Teſſe.</hi> Upon which he immediately commanded the Dragoons
from my Houſe, fearing without doubt, the Anger of the <hi>Court</hi>
(who, it ſeems, is not willing that any ſhould be kill'd) for having
let me dye in the midſt of ſo many Torments. And to ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
he cauſed to be publiſh'd by his Emiſſaries, that I was poiſon'd.
There was left only four Dragoons to Guard me; and in the
Evening I was no ſooner come out of this Trance, but this Count
ſent the Officer who had the Command of my Houſe, to tell me,
that I muſt get me ready to be carried the next day to <hi>Pierre-ciſe.</hi>
With my weak trembling Voice I told him, that I was even that
moment ready to go whereſoever they would carry me. I omit
to ſpeak of the ſorrow of my Wife and all my Kindred, and will
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40628:17"/>
only ſay, I paſs'd over that Night with ſtrange perplexity of
Mind. The Priſon did not fright me, but I miſtruſted the ſtrength
of my Body; I could not imagine that it would hold out ſo long
a Journey. They try'd to put on my Cloaths, but my pains were
ſo great, I could never endure them. In this great Conflict be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Fleſh and the Spirit, I commended my ſelf into the
hands of God, and ſang the <hi>11th.</hi> Verſe of the <hi>40 Pſalm, That
I, O Lord, ſhould do thy mind,</hi> &amp;c. Whileſt I was in this Combat,
my Wife went and threw her ſelf at the Feet of the <hi>Count de
Teſſe,</hi> and with a torrent of Tears, which would have ſoftned the
moſt ſavage of Mankind, conjur'd him to let me be carried to my
Country-Houſe, and ſhe would pay the Guards that ſhould be ſent
to ſecure me; or if not this, that he would pleaſe to put me in
Priſon with my <hi>Brethren</hi> and <hi>Collegues.</hi> But this hard and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Heart, with ſcorn deny'd her Requeſt, telling her, that I
was called the <hi>Pope</hi> of the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> but that now my <hi>Pontifical</hi>
Reign was expir'd; and that it was to have been wiſh'd, that long
ago I had been baniſh'd <hi>Orange,</hi> from whence I did nothing but
ſow my <hi>Hereſies</hi> in all the Provinces of the Kingdom. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
and ſeveral others, who in my Proſperity ſeem'd my Friends,
were preſent, but not one of them would ſpeak a word in my
favour. This ſhews the <hi>Spirit of Popery,</hi> which Idolizes <hi>Proſperity,</hi>
but has not common pity for the <hi>Miſerable.</hi> The next Morning
the <hi>Count de Teſſe</hi> ſent me word, that I muſt be going. He had
before-hand cauſed to be made a <hi>Horſe-Litter,</hi> it being impoſſible
to carry me any other way. They took me out of Bed with
the looks of a dying Man; my Friends about me had much ado
to get on my Cloaths, and I endur'd a great deal while they
were dreſſing me, and ſix Men were forced to carry me into the
<hi>Horſe-Litter,</hi> which was ready for me in the outer Court, ſome
at my Head, others at the middle of my Body, and the reſt at
my Feet. In my Chamber, and at the bottom of the Stairs I ſaw
ſeveral of my Friends, who ſpoke to me only by their Sighs and
their Tears. When they had put me in the <hi>Litter,</hi> they had much
ado to find a poſture in which I might be tolerably eaſie from
my pains. The Court where I ſtood was crouded with People,
who melted into Tears, and tore their hair from their Heads. On
one ſide of me I beheld two of my Neighbours, who for a long
time had been at great difference; to whom I thus addreſs'd my
ſelf. My dear Children, why do you weep? Pour forth Tears
upon your ſelves, and your ſins, which have pull'd down the
wrath of <hi>God</hi> on you. If you love me, and are ſorry for me,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40628:18"/>
give me the Comfort to ſee you embrace each other, and let your
Peace and Agreement be the laſt Fruit of my Miniſtry among
you. I had no ſooner ſpoke theſe words, but they fell upon the
ground, embracing each other, and with their Faces in the Duſt
begg'd Pardon of one another. On the other ſide, I ſaw ſome
Ladies with their Hair about their Ears, <hi>Gentlemen, Citizens,</hi> and
<hi>Country</hi> People, who kiſſing my Hand, begg'd my Bleſſing. I
gave it them with as much Zeal, and as great elevation of Soul
as I ever did in my Life. My Wife, whom the Count had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
the favour to follow me, was now with me, and hanging
about my Neck, melted into Tears. She exhorted me in very
pathetical terms, to Patience and Perſeverance. I was in pain how
to leave theſe good people; but the Dragoons which were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to Guard me, made them withdraw, to make room for
the <hi>Horſe-Litter</hi> to march. I was hardly got without the Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
of my Houſe, but I beheld a multitude of people, which
fill'd four ſtreets and another place adjoyning to them. At the
ſame time that theſe diſconſolate perſons ſaw me, they began to
cry out, <hi>Miſericorde, Miſericorde, Miſericorde.</hi> There were among
them even ſome <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> which ſhed tears with my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
There was ſo great a Croud, that one trod upon another
to ask my Bleſſing. Some of them cry'd, <hi>Adieu, my dear Friend:</hi>
Others, <hi>Adieu, my dear Paſtor;</hi> and all together lifting their hands
and eyes up to Heaven, wiſh'd me a thouſand good things. This
ſad ſight, and theſe ſorrowful voices even rent my Heart, and I
ſwoonded away in my <hi>Litter,</hi> and was forced to take Cordial
Waters to reſtore me. I was no ſooner come to my ſelf, but I
conjur'd thoſe neareſt about me, to let me go in Peace: But they
again began to take me by the Hands, the Feet, and the Arms,
as if they would have kept me for ever. The Dragoons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
were ſo ſenſibly touch'd with this ſpectacle, that they were
obſerv'd to change colour, and were not able to ſpeak a word to
theſe poor afflicted people. There was a Perſon of worth in that
Country, who having enquir'd into all the particulars of this
days Action, ſaid to one of my Friends, who afterwards gave
me an Account of it, <hi>That he did not believe there were ſo many
Tears ſhed in</hi> Rome, <hi>at</hi> Liberius <hi>his going from thence;</hi> nor <hi>at</hi> Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,
<hi>when</hi> Athanaſius <hi>was baniſh'd, as was that day ſhed at</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range.
At laſt, having been often ſtopt in the ſtreet, I got out
of the City by that Gate which is neareſt my Houſe, where again
I found more People weeping, than I had met with in the City.
And here again we were forced to ſtop, to give them my Bleſſing,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40628:18"/>
which they begg'd with great earneſtneſs. And on this manner
I paſs'd by three Gates of the City, all the way accompanied
with a continual croud of People. I was ſtopt again in the Suburbs
of the <hi>Angel,</hi> where a Dragoon gave a box on the Ear to a poor
Woman, who was a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> only becauſe ſhe bewail'd
my Misfortune. The care I always took to do Service to all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of either Religion, had gain'd me their Hearts and Affections,
ſo that I did not much wonder to find a great many honeſt minds
touch'd with my Sufferings.</p>
            <p>I am perſwaded ſome charitable Perſon had inform'd the <hi>Count
de Teſſe</hi> of the ſad condition I was in; and that it was to be fear'd I
might die before I arriv'd at <hi>Pierre-Ciſe.</hi> And upon this conſideration
it was doubtleſs, that he countermanded the Orders he had given.
An Officer comes to him that commanded the Party that guarded
me, and bids him conduct me to a place call'd <hi>Saint Eſprit,</hi> and
put me into the hands of the <hi>Chevalier De Montanegues,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
there, and to whom the <hi>Count de Teſſe</hi> writ. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
upon this new Order they march'd with me: Abundance of
my poor Flock ſtill continually follow'd me, the ſight of them
did but renew my ſorrow, for which reaſon I beg'd them to let
me go in Peace, ſince I was in the hands of God, to whoſe Mercy
I recommended them. This Multitude accompanied me near
half a League; but having got clear from them, I began to turn
my thoughts upon my ſelf: I lift up my Heart to <hi>God</hi> in ſinging
the <hi>143 Pſalm, Lord hear my Prayer,</hi> &amp;c. I recited not one Verſe
without making holy Reflections for ſtrengthening me in this great
Tryal. After this, I ſang the <hi>69 Pſalm, Save me, O God,</hi> &amp;c. But
I was interrupted in this holy Employment by the violent pains
of my broken Thigh. The ſhaking of the <hi>Litter,</hi> and the ſlips
and falſe ſteps of the <hi>Mules</hi> did ſo looſen my Bones, that I fancied
I heard them crack; and very often my Nephew, <hi>John Convenent,</hi>
and two Footmen, which the <hi>Count de Teſſe</hi> permitted me to take
along with me, were forced to give me Cordial Waters to revive
my Spirits, and ſupport my drooping Heart. As I paſs'd by <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi>
a Village of that <hi>Countat,</hi> the Inhabitants flock'd out to ſee
me, and void of all Pity, reviled me, and told me, I deſerv'd to
be thrown into the <hi>Rhoſne.</hi> A change in ones Condition, makes
a change in Peoples Behaviour; heretofore when I us'd to paſs
this way, I met with all Honour and Civility. One of the Guard
of the <hi>Vice-Legat</hi> of <hi>Avignon,</hi> to whom I had done ſome ſmall
kindneſs, being poſted here to hinder any of the People of <hi>Orange</hi>
to paſs, as his Comrades were poſted in other places, he advanced
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40628:19"/>
towards me, and diſpers'd this Mutinous Company. He expreſs'd
a great trouble for my Misfortune, and wiſh'd it had been in his
power to make me happy. I thank'd him for his Civility, and
purſu'd my way to <hi>Saint Eſprit,</hi> where at the foot of the Bridge
I met the <hi>Chevalier De Montanegues,</hi> who expected me. He came
up to my <hi>Litter,</hi> and whiſpering me in the Ear, expreſs'd a mighty
grief at the hard uſage I had met with, but aſſured me, that I
might confidently expect from him whatever he was capable of.
My Wife had the Honour to belong to this honeſt <hi>Gentleman;</hi> this,
together with ſome little Service I had done the <hi>Marqueſs</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
prevail'd with him not to put me in the <hi>Caſtle,</hi> and he gave
this Reaſon to the <hi>Court</hi> for not doing it, that the Stairs were ſo
inconvenient, that it was impoſſible to carry me up. They lodg'd
me in the Houſe of <hi>Mr. Robin,</hi> famous for his great Wit, for the
ingenious Verſes he hath publiſh'd, and for the Honour he hath
merited to be one of the moſt conſiderable Members of the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
of Arles. Mrs. Robin</hi> his Lady, in the abſence of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
treated me with all the kindneſs I could deſire, for which
I ſhall pay an eternal acknowledgment. I was ſo diſordered at
my arrival with the toil of five hours being upon the Road be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Orange</hi> and <hi>Saint Eſprit,</hi> that I knew not where I was.
They had much trouble to take me out of the <hi>Horſe-Litter,</hi> and
I endur'd incredible pain in their carrying me into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
which was to be my <hi>Priſon,</hi> and where for the ſpace of Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
days I kept my Bed, without being able to riſe to have it
made.</p>
            <p>I ſpent the firſt Night in dictating to my Nephew, <hi>John Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venent,</hi>
ſeveral Letters for <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> in which I gave an
Account of my ſad Adventures. As I paſſionately deſir'd to get
a Paſs-port, ſo I writ an importunate Letter to the <hi>Baron De Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heim,</hi>
Envoy Extraordinary from his <hi>Electoral Highneſs</hi> of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh,</hi>
in which I begg'd him to omit nothing to obtain it. I
believ'd it would contribute to the ſucceſs of my Deſign, if I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
my Letter with a ſhort <hi>Petition</hi> to the King, and
which the ſaid <hi>Baron</hi> might pleaſe to preſent in my Name. Here's
the <hi>Petition</hi> in the ſame terms I conceiv'd it.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">

                  <p>NOble <hi>James Pineton de Chambrun,</hi> born and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bred in the City
of <hi>Orange,</hi> heretofore <hi>Miniſter</hi> in the ſame City, with the moſt
Humble Duty repreſents to your <hi>Majeſty,</hi> That for theſe Eleven Years
he hath been depriv'd of the uſe of his Body by the pain of the Gout,
by reaſon of which he is continually confin'd either to his Bed, or a Chair,
and from whence he cannot ſtir but by the help of his Servants. Beſides
this, he is actually tormented with the Stone; and to compleat his
Miſery, he has one of his Thighs broken, by a fall he had out of the
Arms of his Servants. It was, Sir, in this ſad Condition he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from his Houſe, by Order of the <hi>Count de Teſſe,</hi> and carried by
Dragoons to your City of <hi>Saint Eſprit,</hi> without being able to prevail
with the ſaid <hi>Count</hi> to ſuffer his Wife to follow him, and to aſſiſt him
in his great Neceſſities. For theſe Reaſons, he proſtrates himſelf at the
feet of your <hi>Majeſty's</hi> Goodneſs, Clemency, and Mercy, humbly beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your <hi>Majeſty</hi> to give Order, that he may have a <hi>Paſs-port</hi> diſpatch'd
to him, for himſelf and Wife to go into <hi>Holland,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>Accordingly I received an Anſwer from <hi>Mr. Spanheim,</hi> by which
he let me know, that he had ſent away with all Expedition my
Petition to the Marqueſs <hi>De Croiſſy,</hi> and that he writ a Letter
along with it, of which he ſent me the Copy, as alſo of the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs</hi>
his Anſwer. And here truly I cannot forbear ſaying, that
the moſt ardent Charity, and moſt hearty Friendſhip dictated <hi>Mr.
Spanheim</hi>'s Letter. The Reaſons he urged for my gaining what I
deſired, were unanſwerable, ſo the Commendation which it pleas'd
him to give of me, was a certain ſign of his dear kindneſs, but
not the right means, to make me obtain a Paſs-port. On theſe
Occaſions, the more ones Vertue is prais'd, the more it's oppreſs'd:
So that what at another time would have procur'd me favourable
regards, was now partly the cauſe of a more ſevere Perſecution.
In the Anſwer which the Marqueſs <hi>De Croiſſy</hi> ſent <hi>Mr. Spanheim,</hi>
he told him, he had preſented my Petition to the <hi>King,</hi> and that
on the Tueſday following he ſhould have a poſitive Anſwer to it.
Now mind, I beſeech ye, the Intrigues of this World: The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
<hi>De Croiſſy</hi>'s Anſwer was dated the <hi>27th.</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> and
three days before that, which was the <hi>24th.</hi> of the ſame Month,
the Marqueſs <hi>De Louvois</hi> had given Order to the Marqueſs <hi>De la
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40628:20"/>
Trouſſe</hi> to ſend me to <hi>Pierre-Ciſe.</hi> The Tueſday following <hi>Mr. Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heim</hi>
fail'd not to be at <hi>Verſailles,</hi> to receive the poſitive Anſwer
which the Marqueſs <hi>De Croiſſy</hi> had promiſed him, which in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
was this; That the <hi>King</hi> had not yet reſolved to give me a
<hi>Paſs-port,</hi> and notwithſtanding all <hi>Mr. Spanheim</hi>'s importunity, he
could get no other Anſwer. Nay, they hid from him the Order
which had been given to remove me to <hi>Pierre-Ciſe.</hi> While they
were carrying me to the Priſon deſign'd, I received theſe two
diſpatches, and that too by the means of my ſaid Nephew, who
ſtole away from the Boat, and took Poſt for <hi>Orange.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The day after my Arrival at <hi>Saint Eſprit</hi> I was viſited by the
<hi>Chevalier De Montanegues,</hi> who ſpoke to me in the moſt obliging
manner, offering me both his Purſe and every thing elſe in his
Power. He told me, he would uſe his endeavour that I ſhould
be under his Cuſtody till I had received a <hi>Paſs-port:</hi> For, ſays he,
they will not ſurely treat you worſe than other Miniſters of this
Kingdom, abundance of whom I have ſeen paſs along. During
my ſtay here in this <hi>City,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Chevalier</hi> gave leave to all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of Quality to viſit me. One day I entred very far into ſome
Controverſies of Religion with a <hi>Judge</hi> of that place, whoſe Name
was <hi>Mr. Bernard.</hi> And for the Ladies, who came in great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
to ſee me, I endeavoured to inſtruct them as dextrouſly as
poſſibly I could.</p>
            <p>While I exerciſed my ſelf in this good Employment, I forgot
not my poor Wife, which I had left in much danger. I writ to
her Conſolatory Letters, and beg'd her to hide her ſelf from the
inſolencies of the <hi>Dragoons,</hi> and to keep out of the hands of the
<hi>Count de Teſſe.</hi> In a little time I was informed how cruelly this
Count did uſe her: He cauſed her Father's Houſe, where ſhe had
taken Sanctuary, to be beſet with fourteen Dragoons; they ſeized
her, and becauſe ſhe would do nothing againſt her Conſcience,
he ordered her to be dragg'd to my Houſe, and there to be Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
to the whole Regiment of <hi>Dragoons,</hi> without any body to
help her. She was over-whelm'd with ſorrow when ſhe heard of
a Command ſo unjuſt, and which expos'd her Honour and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity
to all the ſhameful practiſes of the Dragoons. A <hi>Religious</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and a Friend of mine, to whoſe Family I had done ſome
good Offices, as ſoon as he knew of the Miſery ſhe was to endure,
immediately ran to <hi>Mr. Chavenon</hi>'s Houſe, and there he ſoon
found means to give ſome eaſe to my Wife; for without making
her, by any Trick, to ſign or abjure, he ſent the <hi>Count</hi> word,
that ſhe had done her <hi>Duty,</hi> as they us'd to ſpeak; upon which
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40628:20"/>
the <hi>Count</hi> withdrew the Dragoons, and my Wife came to me.
The ſight of her was a mighty Comfort to me. We encouraged
each other to Perſeverance, and as a help to it, every day I uſed
thoſe Exerciſes of Piety which it had been my Cuſtom to do at
<hi>Orange.</hi> At the ſame time I learnt that the <hi>Count de Teſſe</hi> upon
the <hi>25th.</hi> of <hi>November</hi> with his Troops diſlodg'd from <hi>Orange,</hi> and
drove before them my <hi>Collegues,</hi> till they came even to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
which are in the <hi>Biſhoprick</hi> of <hi>Valence;</hi> and this was an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Grief to me and my Flock.</p>
            <p>After I had been Twenty days in my Priſon at <hi>St. Eſprit, Mr.
De Vermenton, Provoſt</hi> of <hi>Valence,</hi> came with an Exempt and his
Attendance to remove me to <hi>Pierre-Ciſe.</hi> And I am here obliged
to ſay, that of his Profeſſion, there is not ſo gallant a Man. He
executes his Orders punctually, but he does it with ſo much kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and compaſſion for thoſe he thinks innocent, that whoever
is in his Cuſtody, ſeem as if they enjoy'd their full Liberty. If
I had a Vote in the <hi>Chapter,</hi> as they ſay, he ſhould have it to be
a <hi>Biſhop;</hi> and there are <hi>Biſhops</hi> which I would Vote to be <hi>Provoſts,</hi>
becauſe their inhumanity makes them fit for this Place, and the
Goodneſs of <hi>Mr. De Vermenton</hi> makes him worthy of a <hi>Biſhoprick.</hi>
Before he would come to me, he ordered that I ſhould be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely
advertiſed of his Arrival, that ſo I might not be ſurpriz'd.
After this, he came where I was, and in the moſt friendly terms
in the World; he ſignify'd to me the regret he had that he muſt
be forced to remove me. He had ſo much Compaſſion for my
ſad condition, after I had ſhew'd him my Body, that Tears fell
from his Eyes, and forced him to ſay, he would have given a
great deal to have been diſcharg'd from this Commiſſion. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
a Boat was prepared for my removal. All things being
ready, they took me out of my Bed, from whence I had not
ſtir'd ſince the firſt day they put me in it. God knows what I
ſuffered between my Chamber and the Boat, which lay about a
quarter of a League off. My Foot-men carried me in a Chair,
my Wife and Nephew held up my Legs, and upon the leaſt turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or jogging, I roar'd as if I had been upon the <hi>Wheel.</hi> As I
went, I took my leave of <hi>Mr. De Montanegues,</hi> and thanked him
for all his kindneſſes. It was very difficult to put me in the Boat:
Six Men took me out, as if I had been a dead Corps, and I was
but too ſenſible to feel a thouſand pains. They laid me upon
Quilts, after which, ſix Men which Town'd the Boat began to
march. We were ſix days in going to <hi>Anconne,</hi> which is but ſix
Leagues from the Bridge of <hi>St. Eſprit.</hi> The North Wind blew ſo
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40628:21"/>
violently, the coldneſs of which brought the <hi>Gout</hi> upon me, which
made my whole Body as ſtiff as a Bar of Iron. They kept me
upon the Water from break of day, till Ten or Eleven a Clock
at Night, which failed not to put me in the moſt pitiful condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that ever poor <hi>Gouty</hi> Man was in. My Tongue to complain,
and my Pulſes to let me ſigh, were the only things I had at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
They put me to bed in my Cloaths, either upon Straw,
or Quilts laid upon the Ground. When we came to <hi>Anconne
Mr. De Vermenton,</hi> fearing I might dye by the way, would not
expoſe me, in purſuing the Voyage. He ſtaid therefore two days,
as well in expectation of good Weather, as to let me get a little
ſtrength. A great many Perſons of the City of <hi>Montelimard</hi> came
to ſee me; theſe good People ſpoke to me only by their Sighs and
their Tears, and lift up their Eyes to Heaven to beg of <hi>God,</hi> that
he would Revenge the Cruelty which was exerciſed upon me. I
ſhould be too tedious, if I ſhould relate all the Diſcourſe I had
with theſe good Souls. I told them, that it was a great Glory
for me to ſuffer for the Name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> but that my Body
made me afraid; and that I feared leſt the exceſs of my pains
ſhould make me ſay ſomething contrary to the meaning of my
Heart. As to what concerned them, I told them, they ought to
conſider with themſelves, and to riſe from their fall by a ſpeedy
Repentance, if they would expect Mercy from God. And thus
I endeavoured to Edifie my Neighbours in every place as I paſs'd
along. In the mean while the Tempeſt ſtill continued, and we
had like to have ſeen the <hi>Cardinal De Bouillon,</hi> who came down
the <hi>Rhoſne,</hi> to go to his Baniſhment in the Iſles of <hi>Provence,</hi> caſt
away. With leave of the <hi>Curate,</hi> the <hi>Provoſt</hi> cauſed to be made
on the Sunday a <hi>Litter,</hi> the better to convey me forward. He
employ'd Twelve Country-men, who carried me upon their
ſhoulders, and all at my Charges and Expences, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
amounted to four Piſtols a day. The Noiſe that was abroad
about me, had drawn a great many People in the way as I paſs'd.
The good People of <hi>Dauphine</hi> came in Troops with Tears in their
Eyes to ask my Bleſſing, teſtifying by their general regret how
much they were troubled with my Miſeries. The <hi>Exempt</hi> beat
them back very ſeverely; yet this did not hinder them from
coming up to me to kiſs my hands, and ſend their good wiſhes
after me. At <hi>Sauſſe</hi> I met with a worthy Gentleman, whoſe
Name was <hi>Mr. Du Ferron,</hi> Captain in the Regiment of <hi>Sault.</hi> He
came up to me very ingenuouſly, and mightily comforted me by
a thouſand pretty things, which he entertain'd me with on the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40628:21"/>
Subject of Perſecution. He talk'd to me of the Sermon which
the incomparable <hi>Mr. Claude</hi> had publiſh'd upon theſe words <hi>You
have not yet reſiſted unto Blood.</hi> He even had that Confidence in
me, as to tell me of his deſign of leaving the Kingdom, and that
he was now on his way in order to it. God hath bleſt his good
Reſolution, and I have had the good Fortune to ſee him again
at the <hi>Hague.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>10th.</hi> of <hi>December</hi> I arrived at <hi>Valence,</hi> juſt as it began to
be dark; <hi>Mr. De Vermenton</hi> went before to prepare me a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
and his arrival having declar'd mine, I found in the Suburbs
a great Multitude of People, and in the firſt Court of the Inn,
a great many Perſons of Quality of both Sexes. Some ſaid, Look,
here's that Devil, the <hi>Miniſter</hi> of <hi>Orange;</hi> others cry'd, This is
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Spy; in a word, I heard nothing but Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Invectives, which yet did not trouble me much, calling
to mind the words of the <hi>Saviour</hi> of the World, <hi>Mat. 5. 11. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
are ye when men ſhall revile you, and ſhall ſay all manner of evil
againſt you falſly.</hi> That which I was concern'd for, was, how to
get out of my <hi>Litter;</hi> they were above half an hour before they
could effect it, not knowing on which ſide to take me, being ſo
helpleſs as I was of all the parts of my Body. I beg'd the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſt</hi>
to have a little Patience till I recovered my Spirits; and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
ſo much fine People round about me, I ſaid, <hi>Ladies,</hi> I
beg your Pardon for my rudeneſs, I am not able to lift my Hand
to my Cap to ſalute you: Doubtleſs you have heard talk of <hi>Job,</hi>
you ſee here his Brother, or Couſin-German. At this the Ladies
were touch'd with Pity, and went away haſtily, and I obſerved
ſeveral who took out their Handkerchiefs to wipe away their
Tears. At laſt they carried me from my <hi>Litter</hi> to a Bed, where
they endeavour'd to get off my Cloaths, that I might take ſome
Reſt, after ſo many days fatigue, and want of ſleep.</p>
            <p>The ſame Night that I arrived at <hi>Valence,</hi> there was a Perſon
of worth came to my Bed-ſide. After he had paſs'd ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements
upon me, with a voice pretty loud, becauſe he would
give no ſuſpicion to the <hi>Exempt,</hi> of whom I have ſpoke, whoſe
Name is <hi>Nardouin,</hi> and who never one moment left my Chamber,
nor the ſight of me, and who beſides placed Sergeants at the
Door as Sentinels Night and Day; this honeſt Man, I ſay, with
a low voice told me, that he utterly deteſted the Cruelty and
Barbarity which had been practiſed upon me. After that, he
drew before me ſo hideous a draught of the ſtate of his Soul ſince
his fall, that I was filled with fear: To which he added the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40628:22"/>
which he ſuffered as oft as he was forc'd to go to <hi>Maſs,</hi>
and the horrors of his Mind when he there beheld the Idolatries
they committed. He beg'd me to give him ſome comfort; but
alas! I was but in an ill condition to do it. There came ſome
other Perſons of Note, who could not forbear weeping, amongſt
whom there was a <hi>Marqueſs</hi> of worth, whoſe Name I ſhall conceal,
who was going to the place of his Baniſhment, and whom they
would not ſuffer to ſpeak to me. This Night I paſs'd mighty
unquietly, partly through the terrible pains of the <hi>Gout,</hi> and partly
through the grief that they would not let me have the freedom to
ſpeak to thoſe about me. The <hi>Exempt</hi> lay in my Chamber, he
was the Spy upon all my words and actions, ſo that I had hardly
the liberty to complain. The next day the <hi>Provoſt,</hi> who had
been conferring with the Biſhop of <hi>Valence,</hi> came into my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to tell me, that he would leave me that day to take my reſt,
and that in the mean time he would prepare a Boat. I told him,
that I had much rather go in a <hi>Litter,</hi> becauſe I ſhould endure
the pains of the <hi>Wheel</hi> in their carrying me to the River-ſide, which
was a quarter of a League from my Lodging. He ſeemed to
conſent to it, but though I had ſecur'd one for the next day, yet
he refuſed to carry me this way. In the mean time, I know not
whether it was not from a motive of Compaſſion which made
<hi>Mr. De Vermenton</hi> unwilling I ſhould go any further than <hi>Valence;</hi>
but this I am ſure of, that he feared exreamly leſt I ſhould dye
in his hands. For this Reaſon the two <hi>Phyſicians</hi> of the <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,</hi>
and two <hi>Chirurgions</hi> were ſent to viſit me. They had no
ſooner ſeen my miſerable Body, but they turn'd away their Eyes,
and lift up their ſhoulders; and when I told them, that theſe
were not all my Ills, I was beſides tormented with the Stone.
They ſaid, they could not give a judgment concerning that, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
they made a ſearch; but however they had already ſeen but
too much: And upon this they with-drew. In my Journey my
Thigh was unbound, which cauſed me horrible pains; and thoſe
of the <hi>Gout</hi> increaſed furiouſly upon me: Yet notwithſtanding
this ſad condition, I was impatient to be quickly carried to <hi>Pierre-Ciſe.</hi>
I beg'd the <hi>Provoſt</hi> to ſatisfie my deſire, and he promiſed
me, that the next Morning we ſhould ſet forward; but inſtead
of that, I ſaw coming into my Chamber that Morning the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Valence.</hi> It was eaſie to imagine that there was ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
laid, which made me ſtand upon my Guard. My Arms
were ſo ſtiff through the effects of the <hi>Gout,</hi> that it was impoſſible
for me to lift my hand to my Cap to ſalute him. After he was
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40628:22"/>
ſet by my Bed's-head, he began to tell me, that he was ſorry to
ſee me in ſo much trouble, that this ought to make me conſider
with my ſelf, that I might not go to <hi>Pierre-Ciſe,</hi> where I ſhould
ſuffer much; that I had much better re-unite my ſelf, by which
means I ſhould be at eaſe, that the <hi>King</hi> would allow me large
<hi>Penſions; That his intention was not only upon his own Subjects to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite
them to the Church, but that his Piety incited him to cauſe all
other Proteſtants to enter into the Church;</hi> and that I ſhould be a
very proper Perſon to contribute to ſo good a Deſign, and that
through my means, there might be a good underſtanding, and
that ſome ſatisfaction might be given to <hi>Proteſtants</hi> concerning
ſome Points; and that for his part, he would make no ſcruple to
conſent to the taking away ſome <hi>Images</hi> out of <hi>Churches,</hi> and
that even he had already taken away a great many out of his
<hi>Churches,</hi> where very few are ſeen; and that the Cup would be
given to the People again. But that it was neceſſary to have ſome
conſiderable Man of our Party, who ſhould promote this buſineſs,
and that for certain, I was the Man the moſt fit. This in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
is what this <hi>Prelate</hi> ſaid to me at this firſt interview. To
which I anſwer'd, that I thanked him for the Honour he had
done me; that as to the Sufferings he mentioned, I was fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to undergo them; that if I had believed I could have been
ſaved in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, I ſhould never have let my ſelf have
been thus tormented for theſe two Months. As for Penſions,
through the goodneſs of God I had no need of them; as mean
a Gentleman as I was, I had where-withall to live. As for the
Praiſes he beſtowed on me, in thinking me fit to Labour towards
a <hi>Reformation,</hi> I was very ſenſible of my own weakneſs; but yet
I could willingly ſpend my Blood to effect ſo good a Work: But
in the condition Affairs are, there's no likelihood that things ſhould
conclude by Lenity and Friendſhip, that are begun by force of
Arms; and that therefore I ſhould be extreamly obliged to him,
if he would obtain a <hi>Paſs-port</hi> for me to go where Providence
ſhould direct me. Do not flatter your ſelf about it, Sir, reply'd
he, you are a Priſoner of <hi>State,</hi> and you ought not to expect any
<hi>Paſs-port.</hi> It will be thought an Honour if they can make you a
<hi>Catholick.</hi> It is very well known that you are cloſely engaged
to the <hi>Prince of Orange,</hi> and you'll never be ſuffered to go near
him. But pray tell me, ſays he, Do you think it would not be
more for your Advantage to ſerve the <hi>King,</hi> than the <hi>Prince of
Orange?</hi> Is not he a greater Maſter? I know very well that 'tis
your engagement to the Intereſts of that <hi>Prince</hi> which ſticks at
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40628:23"/>
your heart, and that you are afraid to diſpleaſe him in changing
your Religion; but I do aſſure you, that we have certain News,
that he is getting himſelf inſtructed. Pardon me Sir, reply'd I, if
I tell you, that I do not believe a word on't. I had the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to know him in his moſt tender years, he was then perfectly
well inſtructed, and I doubt not but his Underſtanding has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd
with his Age; and as I am perſwaded he hath no ſcruple
of Conſcience upon the account of his <hi>Religion,</hi> ſo neither does
he need any further Inſtruction. You are not the firſt Sir, who
hath told me this News, there are a great many others who pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
it, but there are reaſons for all this, and 'tis not hard to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the deſign for which all theſe Reports are ſpread throughout
<hi>Europe.</hi> I know that your <hi>King</hi> is a great <hi>King,</hi> but I know alſo
that my <hi>Prince</hi> is a great <hi>Prince,</hi> who hath always done me much
good, and honours me with his kindneſs: and I ſhould be very
ungrateful if I did but think of changing my Maſter. What
have I done to deſerve to be a Priſoner of State? I have never
medl'd with things of this nature; ſo that Sir, I muſt once more
beg you to procure for me a <hi>Paſs port,</hi> or if Mr. <hi>Vermenton</hi> find
that I cannot be remov'd, becauſe of my Pains, be pleas'd to let
me be put in one of your Priſons with my Brethren. After this
diſcourſe, he ſtill very preſſingly ſollicited me to a change, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
offering me both Riches and Honours, to all which I only
anſwer'd him, (that I might rid my hands of him) <hi>That people
do not change their Religion as they do their Shirts,</hi> and that I ſhould
have time to think on't in my Priſon of <hi>Pierre-ciſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was by his order that they made a ſhew of my tarrying in
<hi>Valence,</hi> till they receiv'd orders from the Marqueſs <hi>de la Trouſſe</hi>
who commanded in <hi>Dauphine;</hi> they remov'd me to an ordinary
Houſe in the City, where I was continually guarded by the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt,</hi>
and by <hi>Serjeants.</hi> My dear Brethren, who as yet were not
thrown into Dungeons, as afterwards they were, ſent to me a
truſty perſon to tell me that they offer'd up their Prayers to God
for me, and beg'd that I would pray for them: And I did the
ſame in their behalf.</p>
            <p>As they continually conſulted in <hi>Valence</hi> to find out ſome way to
make me yield, ſo they were of opinion that it would be beſt
to take from me, my Wife and my Nephew, and deprive me of
all my Servants; they accus'd the two firſt of encouraging me in
my reſolution not to change. The <hi>Exempt</hi> it ſeems had heard us
diſcourſe about it; and for the others, they knew that they were
abſolutely neceſſary for me, ſince they only underſtood how to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40628:23"/>
manage me in my bed, and to ſerve me in all my natural neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities.
In effect, I was to be dealt with, as if I had been a new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
Infant, and I had rotted in my own filth, if I had been in
the hands of other perſons, ſince I could never have endur'd them
to have done ſuch vile and unpleaſant work. But they told my
Wife and my Nephew that they muſt withdraw, and me they
told, that I ſhould have Dragoons or Serjeants to wait on me.
This diſcourſe was to me as a mighty clap of Thunder, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order'd
me ſo extreamly, that I knew not where I was. I was
very well aware that they us'd me after this manner, on purpoſe
to reduce me to the laſt extremity, and to throw me into Pains
a thouſand times worſe than thoſe of Hell; for if my Servants
who were us'd to my Miſeries, could not touch me without cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
me exceſſive pain, what could I expect from the hands of
Dragoons, and Serjeants, people void of Pity and Mercy? My
only refuge was Prayers and Tears, and I beg'd God that he
would have pity on me, but my Sins were too great to obtain
from his aſſiſting Grace what I beg'd of him, having a mind to
put on my Cloths to try whether I could endure them when I was
to go to <hi>Pierre-ciſe,</hi> as they had given me notice to be ready for
that purpoſe, I ſuffer'd ſo much Torments that I let ſlip theſe
curſed Words, <hi>Well, I will re-unite my ſelf.</hi> The <hi>Exempt</hi> who was
preſent, immediately run to the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> without ſaying a word
to me; the Biſhop comes the ſame moment accompanied by the
<hi>Provoſt</hi> and ſome other Perſons, and having preſented me with a
Paper to ſign, and pronouncing ſome words in <hi>Latin,</hi> which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
I never heard, I refus'd to do it, as I have conſtantly refus'd
as oft as I have been ſollicited to it. He told me, that they had
acquainted him that I ſaid, <hi>I would re-unite my ſelf;</hi> I anſwer'd
him, that it was true, but it was the violent pains I endur'd which
forced thoſe words from my Mouth, in the diſtraction of my
Mind, and that if I ſhould <hi>re-unite my ſelf,</hi> it would be no great
Conqueſt gain'd, ſince the condition he ſaw me in had depriv'd
me of my Reaſon. And really, I knew not what I did, my
Reaſon was ſo diſorder'd; nay, I had hardly the uſe of my Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
I doubt not but the <hi>Biſhop</hi> caus'd to be ſign'd in the Paper,
that he had preſented before me the <hi>Provoſt</hi> and ſome other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
as Witneſſes of my pretended <hi>Converſion:</hi> But I appeal par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
to the Conſcience of Mr. <hi>de Vermenton,</hi> whether he ever
heard me ſay in the preſence of the ſaid <hi>Biſhop,</hi> that <hi>I would re-u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
my ſelf.</hi> And I make the ſame appeal to all the other perſons
as to this matter, as I take them for honeſt people, ſo I hope they'l
bear witneſs to the <hi>Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:40628:24"/>
In the mean time let not any believe I ſay this to excuſe my
fault. To my ſorrow, I am but too ſenſible that I have faln a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and that the fatal words which I utter'd, have ſeparated
me from the external Communion of the true <hi>Church,</hi> till thro'
the Mercy of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Miniſtery</hi> of his Servants I ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admitted.
If I had not thought ſo, and if I were not yet of the
ſame mind, I ſhould not have ſhed ſo many Tears; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
I ſhould have rejoyced at my ſufferings, and ſhould have
thought I might have had a place in the Catalogue of the moſt
Illuſtrious <hi>Confeſſors;</hi> But alas! I look upon my ſelf as a cowardly
Souldier, <hi>who turn'd my Back in the day of Battle,</hi> and as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful
Servant, who hath betray'd the Intereſts of his Maſter.</p>
            <p>Although my fall was after that manner, and of the nature I
have been repreſenting, yet the Biſhop of <hi>Valence</hi> did not fail to
boaſt of it as a mighty honour to himſelf; he continually talkt of
it to all comers and goers, and he writ of it to the <hi>Court,</hi> and
triumpht upon it, as the greateſt of his Victories.</p>
            <p>But my condition was vaſtly different from his; that which
was the ſubject of his Glory was the matter of my Shame; and
the Honour he claim'd in perverting me, was an Eternal reaſon
for my Sighs and Tears.</p>
            <p>Is it poſſible for me to expreſs my grief to that degree I felt it?
Is it poſſible for me to deſcribe the ſtate of my Soul in Colours e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
black with the ſorrow that overwhelm'd me on that ſad
occaſion? Can I tell forth my Groans to all <hi>Europe</hi> with as mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
a Voice as I did the moment immediately after my pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
thoſe curſed words?</p>
            <p>Whilſt I was in this Affliction, the Biſhop of <hi>Valence</hi> receiv'd
Letters from <hi>Court</hi> in anſwer to thoſe he had writ concerning my
<hi>pretended</hi> change: He pleas'd himſelf mightily in the <hi>Congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
which he receiv'd from the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> and Father
<hi>la Chaiſe,</hi> upon his imaginary Victory. The Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois</hi>
writ to him alſo concerning it; and immediately upon his recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of theſe <hi>Letters</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks publiſh'd in <hi>Valence</hi> that
there was a <hi>Penſion</hi> of two thouſand <hi>Livres</hi> ſettl'd upon me. This
<hi>Prelate</hi> came to me, and told me, that it now depended only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my ſelf, whether I would be very happy; that they writ him
from <hi>Gourt,</hi> that I might ask whatever I had a mind to, and it
ſhould be granted me. And that the King only wiſht that I would
continue a little while at <hi>Valence.</hi> I told him, that I had no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of any thing, and that were I in the greateſt neceſſity, I
had rather dye, than it ſhould be ſaid, I ſold my <hi>Religion</hi> and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40628:24"/>
Conſcience for Money; that they did me great wrong in detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me at <hi>Valence,</hi> and that they would be much more juſt in
granting me a <hi>Paſs-port.</hi> Nay, to try him, I deſir'd him however
to procure me leave to go to <hi>Orange,</hi> though in truth I had no
great mind to return thither. He told me that with time this
laſt might be, as ſoon as I had given any proofs of my Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Fidelity to the <hi>King;</hi> but for a <hi>Paſs-port,</hi> I ought not
to expect that. And he added, that he obſerv'd me mightily
caſt down, and askt me why I was ſo. It ſeems the <hi>Exempt</hi> and
<hi>Serjeants</hi> had given him conſtant information, for they had their
haunts about the place where I was, and never fail'd every day
to give him a faithful account of every thing that paſs'd. How
is it poſſible, Sir, ſaid I to him, that I ſhould not be caſt down
after having receiv'd and do ſtill receive ſuch cruel uſage? I muſt
needs tell you, that I am in continual Tears by reaſon of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
I ſuffer both in Body and Mind. You fancy that you
have gain'd a mighty Victory by thoſe words I ſpoke, but how
eaſie is it to triumph over a poor miſerable? Upon this firſt viſit,
I was not in circumſtances to let him know more of my Mind.
But he made me ſeven other viſits while I ſtay'd at <hi>Valence,</hi> what
our Diſcourſes were upon them all, I ſhall here in few words re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</p>
            <p>He was continually telling me, That there was nothing ſo fatal
as <hi>Schiſm,</hi> nor no greater bleſſing than a <hi>Re-union.</hi> I told him,
'Twas very true, that <hi>Unity</hi> was a moſt pleaſing thing to <hi>God,</hi> when it
could be maintain'd; but that yet we muſt mind what St. <hi>Paul</hi>
ſays, who teaches, that we muſt <hi>follow Peace with all men as much
as 'tis poſſible;</hi> from which Doctrine we may obſerve, that when
the <hi>Unity</hi> endangers our <hi>Salvation,</hi> we are indiſpenſably oblig'd to
break it, and that for as much as the ſame <hi>Apoſtle</hi> teaches us, that
we muſt not ſo much as eat with <hi>Idolaters,</hi> and that there can be no
<hi>agreement between the Temple of God and Idols.</hi> Upon this he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to diſcourſe to me of the <hi>Schiſm</hi> of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> but it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
not <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n extraordinary Judgment to perceive that he was but
little vers'd in that Hiſtory. I told him that certainly the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi>
were in the wrong to make a <hi>Schiſm</hi> about a matter of <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline;</hi>
but that our <hi>Reformers</hi> ſeparated about <hi>Eſſential</hi> matters of
<hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Worſhip,</hi> as well as about the <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi>
and for this reaſon 'tis impoſſible to make them guilty, unleſs it
can be demonſtrated that they have err<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d in the truth of their
pretenſions. He did not perſue this point very far, and he only
told me, that as he had already ſaid, that ſome things might be
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40628:25"/>
Reformed in the <hi>Church,</hi> and that he eſteemed me a very fit
Perſon to aſſiſt in this good work. I do not very well remember
how we began to diſcourſe of the preſent <hi>Perſecution,</hi> but I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
remember that he ſaid theſe very words to me; <hi>It is believed
that the Biſhops are the Authors of the Methods that are now taken for
a re-union, but certainly 'tis a great miſtake; we have indeed upon this
occaſion, repreſented what we thought our Duty, but 'tis the King's Will,
which no body ought to oppoſe.</hi> While he diſcourſed to me on this
manner, I lift up my Eyes to Heaven, as aſtoniſh'd to hear a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi>
able to talk ſo directly againſt Truth. In his Diſcourſe he
ſeemed to me, as if he had deteſted all Violence, and yet he
was no ſooner gone from me, but I heard he was on Horſe-back
at the head of the <hi>Dragoons,</hi> going to torment all thoſe in his
<hi>Dioceſs,</hi> who would not either <hi>abiure,</hi> or go to <hi>Maſs.</hi> The <hi>Prince</hi>
my Maſter, I found, troubled his Mind much; we ſeldom diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed
together, but he would tell me, theſe head-ſtrong Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſtill fancy that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> will come to their Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
which made me ſay one day to a Friend of mine, that
the Name of the <hi>Prince</hi> my Maſter, was as terrible to the Biſhop
of <hi>Valence,</hi> as the Drum which was made of the Skin of <hi>Ziska</hi>
was heretofore to the Emperors.</p>
            <p>At another of our Meetings we ſell to diſcourſe about the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
of the <hi>Maſs;</hi> he gave me ſo particular account of it, as if he
had believed it the compoſition of Angels. I told him, that to
ſpeak truth, there were very good things in't; but yet, that it
ſeem'd like a Cloak made of ſo many different pieces, that thoſe
who conſidered it throughly, did not ſee thoſe fine things in it
which he did. As for Example, Sir, ſaid I, who can endure
this paſſage in't, where the <hi>Prieſt</hi> ſays, We preſent to thee this
<hi>Sacrifice</hi> in Honour of the Holy <hi>Virgin,</hi> St. <hi>Peter,</hi> St. <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c.
What, offer to <hi>God</hi> that Blood by which theſe <hi>Saints</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd,
in Honour to them! Is not this eſteeming leſs of the
Blood of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> than of thoſe Saints? All the Anſwer I could
get from him was this, <hi>That we ought to underſtand theſe words in
the ſenſe of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> I cited to him that incomparable paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> which is found in his <hi>Dialogues; God does not
change the nature of Bread, but adds Grace to Nature.</hi> I quoted it
to him in <hi>Greek.</hi> He told me, that heretofore he underſtood this
<hi>Language,</hi> but that he had now forgot it. Yes, Sir, ſaid I to him,
I do believe it; you have had other buſineſs than to mind your
<hi>Grammar.</hi> He acquitted himſelf not much better from what I
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40628:25"/>
ſhewed him in the <hi>Decretals.</hi> He laid much weight upon theſe
words, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> telling me, 'twas impoſſible to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in believing what Jeſus Chriſt had ſaid. Upon which I
ſhewed him the Explanation which the <hi>Decretals</hi> themſelves give
of this paſſage, under the Title of the <hi>Conſecration.</hi> Your <hi>Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,</hi>
ſaid I to him, ought not to be ſuſpected by you; and theſe
words of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> they thus explicate: <hi>Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſte
Sacramentum quod vocatur caro Chriſti dicitur etiam corpus Chriſti,
non propriè ſed impropriè, non rei veritate, ſed ſignificante myſterio,
ita ut is ſit ſenſus, hoc eſt corpus meum, id eſt, ſignificat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this, he alſo gave me the ſame Anſwer, to wit, <hi>That it muſt
be underſtood in the ſenſe of the Church.</hi> But ſaid I, Sir, it is in
theſe <hi>Decretals</hi> which the <hi>Church</hi> explains her meaning, and ſhe
ſays, that we muſt underſtand theſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> not
that the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is <hi>truly</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> but that it
is <hi>repreſented</hi> and <hi>ſignified</hi> by the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>The Anſwers which this <hi>Prelate</hi> made me, let me clearly ſee,
that he had ſtudied more <hi>Politicks</hi> than <hi>Divinity;</hi> that he was more
converſant among the leaves in the <hi>Archives</hi> of his <hi>Dioceſs,</hi> that he
might increaſe his <hi>Revenues,</hi> than in the Holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that he
might be <hi>perfect in all good works, and be the man of God,</hi> according
to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Precept; and in a word, his Mind was more ſet upon
the Greatneſs of this <hi>World,</hi> and the Intrigues of the <hi>Court,</hi> than
upon the Humility of a true <hi>Biſhop,</hi> or upon the unfolding of the
Myſteries of <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To perſwade me, that it was Lawful to uſe <hi>Force,</hi> to make <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>
Perſons come into the <hi>Church,</hi> according to that ſaying, <hi>Coge
eos intrare, compel them to come in;</hi> which was, it ſeems, much in
uſe in thoſe days. He ſent me the two Epiſtles of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi>
which ſome had lately taken the pains to Tranſlate into <hi>French:</hi>
The firſt was to <hi>Vincent,</hi> a <hi>Donatiſt</hi> Biſhop; the other was to <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface,
General</hi> of the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s Army. I was prepared to Anſwer
theſe two <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> but I was gone ſo far with him, that I preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his asking my Opinion of them. I had before quoted to him
this incomparable paſſage of one of the <hi>Ancients; Nova haec &amp;
inaudita praedicatio quae verberibus fidem ſuadere conatur. This is a
new and ſtrange way of Preaching, which goes about to perſwade men
into the Myſteries of Religion by blows and ſtripes.</hi> However I had
got ready for him ſome paſſages of the ſame <hi>Father,</hi> and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to tell him, that although St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was endow'd with a
great many rare gifts, that yet, he was but a Man, and for that
Reaſon, ſuffered himſelf to be a <hi>Court-Biſhop.</hi> I ſhould be too
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40628:26"/>
tedious if I related the particulars of all I talk'd of with this <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi>
concerning <hi>Religion;</hi> I think it ſufficient to ſay, for the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of my Neighbour, and my own ſatisfaction, that ſince I
let ſlip thoſe raſh words, there hath not gone out of my Mouth
any that have in the leaſt been againſt my knowledge, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Dictates of my own Conſcience; on the contrary,
I have endeavoured as much as 'twas poſſible for me to Edifie the
Church of <hi>God,</hi> exhorting all thoſe I met with, either to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,
in caſe they were not yet fallen, or if they were fallen,
to riſe again by a ſpeedy Repentance: I never omitted the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
Exerciſes of Piety; I prayed with all comers and goers;
I ſang Pſalms with a loud voice; and although they continually
told me, if I took not care, I ſhould ruin my ſelf; I anſwered
them, that I would glorifie my <hi>God,</hi> and that Death was far more
dear to me than Life. One day the <hi>Biſhop</hi> reproach'd me, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
him briskly, that I ſhould all my Life think my ſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to thank him, that he could not reaſonably ſpeak againſt
my Devotion, ſeeing he had told all his <hi>Dioceſs,</hi> that our Prayers
were good, and that there was no fault to be found with our
<hi>Pſalms.</hi> Two Months and a half I continued in that City with
a dejection of Mind not to be conceiv'd. My Thoughts were ſo
taken up, that I ſcarce was ſenſible of the pains of my Body,
which has almoſt perſwaded me into that Opinion, that pain ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
only in the Thought. The <hi>Biſhop's Commiſſary of War</hi> for the
<hi>Province</hi> of <hi>Dauphine</hi> came to ſee me; he was going to <hi>Orange</hi> to
carry 500 <hi>Piſtols</hi> to free thoſe <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks which were poor
from Quartering <hi>Souldiers,</hi> by which one may judge at the Expence
the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have been put to. This <hi>Commiſſary</hi> offered me Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
for which I did not vouchſafe to thank him. He exhorted
me alſo to write the motives of my <hi>pretended Converſion,</hi> and ſet
before me the Example of the <hi>Miniſter Vigné.</hi> I told him, I was
not ſuch a one as he took me for; that he had forgot the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons</hi>
and <hi>Drummers</hi> which he ſent me, whoſe terrible noiſe had
made me forget my <hi>Latin;</hi> and thus I briskly ſent him away,
laughing at him and his offers.</p>
            <p>And ſince the mention of this <hi>Commiſſary</hi> hath brought to my
Mind the <hi>Miniſter Vigne,</hi> I cannot forbear noting here, that this
<hi>Apoſtate</hi> being come to <hi>Valence</hi> to get himſelf received a <hi>Counſellor</hi>
in the <hi>Preſidial Court,</hi> came to ſee me, accompanied by two of
the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Valence</hi> his Men. He came into my Chamber all
trembling and pale; I received him very coldly, and after a
ſhort diſcourſe of Civility, which he thought fit to make me, I
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40628:26"/>
ſpoke to him in <hi>Latin,</hi> becauſe there were ſome Perſons I had no
mind ſhould underſtand us. I deſired him to tell me, in what
condition his <hi>Conſcience</hi> was ſince his <hi>change:</hi> He was extreamly
ſurprized at my Queſtion, and ſeemed at a great loſs: But never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
after a ſhort ſilence, he anſwered me with a ſtammering
voice, that his Conſcience was at reſt; upon which I told him,
that mine was in Hell, although I had not done what he had
done. I have no quiet Night nor Day, for an ill word which I
ſpoke, and yet you ſay, that your Conſcience is in perfect Peace.
Ah! Sir, you do not conſider as you ſhould; you had much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
confeſs your ſin to <hi>God,</hi> than to withſtand Truth unjuſtly.
Says he to me, I am <hi>re-united</hi> to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that ſo I may
not be guilty of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> which is ſo hurtful to our Salvation:
I am <hi>re-united poſitively,</hi> but I am <hi>ſeparated</hi> from her <hi>negatively.</hi> Said
I to him, if you were ſpeaking to ſome ignorant <hi>Country-man,</hi>
you might throw ſome duſt in his Eyes by this diſtinction, but do
you believe me ſo ignorant, as not to underſtand your <hi>Jargoon?</hi>
Can you ſay, that you are ſeparated <hi>negatively</hi> from the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church, in rejecting the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Worſhip</hi> which we diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove?
Have not you very lately publiſh'd a Letter, directed to
your <hi>pretended new Converts,</hi> in which you maintain what you tell
me now is not the object of your Faith? Have a care, that in
lying to Men, you do not lie to God. In all likelihood he did
not expect that I durſt talk to him with ſo much Courage, but that
in Policy I would diſſemble with him my Opinions; ſo that he
withdrew in ſome confuſion, and went directly to the <hi>Biſhop</hi>'s
Houſe, where 'tis very likely he made him a partial recital of our
Diſcourſe; but yet the <hi>Biſhop</hi> never took the leaſt notice to me of
it.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as I was a little recovered from the ſwelling of my
Heart, which had almoſt deprived me of the uſe of my Reaſon,
I preſumed to write to his <hi>Highneſs;</hi> the Letter was Dated the <hi>12th.</hi>
of <hi>January</hi> 1686, and in that I gave him a ſhort account of all
my ſad Adventures. This <hi>Excellent</hi> Maſter had the goodneſs to
cauſe <hi>Mr. De Schuylemberg</hi> to write to me, that he was very much
concerned at all my Miſeries, and that I ought ſtill to hope that
<hi>God</hi> would not forſake me. This Anſwer was a mighty aſſiſtance
to me, and contributed much to my Comfort; for as <hi>God</hi> had
ſtill deſign'd more Afflictions and Sufferings for me, ſo theſe marks
of kindneſs to one ſo unworthy, help mightily to ſupport me in
my Combats.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:40628:27"/>
A few days after I had received this Anſwer, the Biſhop of
<hi>Valence</hi> made his laſt Viſit to me, and it was very troubleſom: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
then he had never preſs'd me, but then he told me, that I
ſeem'd as if I intended to live without the exerciſe of any <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi>
that I would create to my ſelf troubleſom buſineſſes, for
which he was ſorry; but however he was to take care of me,
that as I had importuned him, either to procure a <hi>Paſs-port</hi> for
me, or leave to go to <hi>Orange,</hi> he had obtain'd leave for me to go
to <hi>Romeyer,</hi> which is near <hi>Die,</hi> where there is good Air to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
my Health. I was very ſenſible that he was unwilling to tell
me, that this was to be the place of my <hi>Baniſhment;</hi> but yet I
was overjoy'd that I was ſuffered to go out of <hi>Valence,</hi> which I
eſteemed as <hi>Hell.</hi> And I went away as ſoon as 'twas poſſible,
notwithſtanding my pains. But before I left the place, I failed
not by this Letter to take my laſt Farewel of my dear <hi>Collegues.</hi>
            </p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <p>I Bid you Farewel, my dear Brethren, if you can yet think
me worthy of ſo Honourable a Relation. I am leaving
this place, which has been ſo fatal to me, and am going to
withdraw my ſelf into a <hi>Deſart,</hi> which I muſt look upon as a

me from you, and I am no longer a <hi>Faithful</hi> and <hi>Loyal</hi>

Upon the ſecond of <hi>March</hi> I arriv'd in that horrid <hi>Deſart</hi>
to which I was baniſh'd. Upon the Road I was in great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities
of Mind. Divers Miniſters who had yielded, ſome
through Violence, others moſt willingly, were at <hi>Die,</hi> a Town
which I was to paſs through. Is it poſſible, ſaid I to my ſelf,
that thou art ſent near ſuch a Neſt of <hi>Apoſtates,</hi> the remembrance
of whoſe Crime will continually reproach thee with thy Fault?
I made my complaint with ſuch vehemence, that a Gentleman
travelling by the <hi>Litter</hi> where I lay, askt one of my Servants
whether I was not mad. I will ſay nothing of the Tears which
abundance of good people ſhed for me as I went along; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
from them a thouſand kind wiſhes, for they very well
knew the truth of my Heart, and the regret I had for having let
ſlip thoſe <hi>Words.</hi> The frightful <hi>Deſart</hi> into which I was baniſht,
is a little narrow <hi>Valley,</hi> into which you cannot enter neither, but
through the opening of an inacceſſible Rock to the <hi>Weſt</hi> of the
ſaid <hi>Valley.</hi> To the <hi>Eaſt</hi> there's a barren Mountain call'd <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſſe,</hi>
of ſo prodigious a height, that to arrive at the top of it, it
will require three hours time. To the <hi>North,</hi> and to the <hi>South,</hi>
there are Hills which are joyn'd by heaps to one another, and
which caſt ſuch a ſhadow, and ſo far, that in Winter one can
hardly ſee the Sun-ſhine. That which is the only pleaſant thing
there, is a little <hi>Brook</hi> which takes its <hi>Source</hi> from the ſaid Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of <hi>Glandaſſe,</hi> and by its pretty Murmurs might ſerve to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the Mind when 'tis free from diſmal Thoughts, which mine
was not. Before theſe laſt Revolutions, all the Inhabitants of the
three or four <hi>Villages</hi> which are in this <hi>Vale,</hi> were of the <hi>Reform'd</hi>
Religion, except two or three Families, which was a great ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to me; for while I ſtaied in this place of <hi>Exile</hi> theſe good
people came to pray with me, and to comfort me. The News
of my arrival in this melancholly abode was no ſooner ſpred in
the Neighbourhood, but there reſorted to me people of all ſorts, of
each Sex, which ſtole away to ſee me, and to mix their Tears
with mine. There came to me ſome from every <hi>Province</hi> therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts,
and they all aſſur'd me, that my <hi>Fall</hi> was ſo far from giving a
<hi>Scandal,</hi> that every body had compaſſion on me, knowing to
what a ſad condition they had reduc'd me, and that they pray'd
and hoped the example which I had furniſhed the <hi>Church</hi> would be
of great <hi>Edification</hi> to her. What Edification ſaid I, can any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from ſo great a ſinner as I am? I do indeed beſeech God
with all the powers of my Soul, that he would pleaſe to give me
the grace to glorifie his Name, but I fear the fault I committed,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40628:28"/>
will keep him from hearing my Prayers. I am firmly reſolv'd
rather to dye than make any profeſſion of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
But alas! what am I? and how do I know but the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which they may yet make me endure, may cauſe me once
more to <hi>Fall?</hi> I told the <hi>Count de Teſſe</hi> that I would be dragg'd thro'
the Streets of <hi>Orange,</hi> and yet I was not as good as my word.
What's paſt makes me fear what's to come.</p>
            <p>During the five Months that I was in this place of <hi>Baniſhment,</hi>
the chief Employment in my Bed of Affliction, was, every day
to bath it with my Tears. I never ceas'd praying and ſighing,
and afflicting my Soul; and if ſometimes they forced me out of
my Bed, and carried me into a Garden, as oft as I ſaw thoſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
<hi>Mountains,</hi> I repeated what <hi>David</hi> ſaid in the <hi>121 Pſalm, I
will lift up my eyes unto hills from whence cometh my help. My help
cometh from the Lord which made heaven and earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter</hi> being near, the Biſhop of <hi>Valence</hi> came to
<hi>Die,</hi> which is about a League from the place of my Baniſhment,
to <hi>Confeſs</hi> and <hi>Communicate</hi> the <hi>pretended new Converts.</hi> I had
reaſon to believe he would come and diſquiet me, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he did not fail; there happen'd to be with me one Mr. <hi>Julian</hi>
an <hi>Advocate</hi> of <hi>Die,</hi> and a very honeſt man, and one who hath
glorifi'd <hi>God</hi> by his retiring; I intreated him to hide himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
my Bed, that he might have the pleaſure of hearing what I
ſaid to the <hi>Biſhop.</hi> He granted my requeſt, and quickly, the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi>
accompanied with a great many <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and ſome <hi>Officers</hi> of
the <hi>Army</hi> come in. For half a quarter of an hour our Diſcourſe
ran upon things indifferent; but upon his coming up cloſe to my
Bed-ſide all the other people withdrew, and putting his head very
near mine, he askt me, if I would not think of ſigning the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
which he had ſhew'd me, and of doing what a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
ought to do. I anſwer'd him, that for the Writing I could
not ſign it, and to live as a good <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> I ſhould endeavour all
the days of my Life. He preſs'd me extreamly. But at laſt I
told him for a full anſwer, that I would beg him never more to
urge me, and conjur'd him to order the <hi>Curate</hi> of the place not to
require me to exerciſe any Act of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, ſince that
being recovered from the diſtraction of my Mind, I was in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to ſpeak of my Life.</p>
            <p>He appear'd not much troubl'd at this Diſcourſe, he only ſaid,
<hi>Well, you'l think on't,</hi> and ſo left me with great Civility. The <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate</hi>
came out of his ſecret place, and falling upon my Neck,
embrac'd me with abundance of Tenderneſs and Tears, telling
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40628:28"/>
me that my Diſcourſe had extreamly edifi'd him, that he muſt
leave me to go to <hi>Die,</hi> where the Biſhop would not fail to report,
that I had promis'd him every thing; which accordingly happen'd:
For this Biſhop was no ſooner at <hi>Die,</hi> than in the preſence of a
great many People, he ſaid, That he came from me, that I was
a very honeſt man, that he was pleas'd with my Converſation,
and that I had promis'd to Confeſs, and to Communicate. The
Advocate who was there preſent while the Biſhop ſaid this, whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd
in the Ears of ſome of his Friends; <hi>This is not true I am wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of it;</hi> and afterwards unfolded the whole Myſtery, aſſuring
them that the Biſhop ſaid all this only to ſeduce them.</p>
            <p>The continual troubles of my mind quickly threw me back in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the condition I was in at <hi>Valence.</hi> I was ſeiz'd by a violent Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
which diſtracted me, yet I was quickly well, without uſing
the leaſt Medicine; but though my Body was eas'd, yet my Mind
was ſo tormented with ſad Thoughts, which continually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
themſelves to me, that I knew not where I was. It
ſeem'd as if God himſelf had imprinted my Sin on my Heart, to
make me the more ſenſible of its horrible foulneſs, and to the end
that I might run to him by Prayers, Sighs and Tears. I muſt
confeſs, that I was forſaken of all Comfort, for I was able oftner
than once to ſay with <hi>Job,</hi> c. 3. v. 3, 4. <hi>Let the day periſh where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I was born, and the night in which it was ſaid, there is a man-Child
conceiv'd: Let that day be darkneſs; Let not God regard it from
above, neither let the light ſhine upon it.</hi> To this I added, what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
in the ſame Chapter which here I care not to write. To
call in the Conſolations of my God, I often repeated theſe words
in the 77th <hi>Pſal.</hi> v. 7. 8. <hi>Is his mercy clean gone from us? and is his
promiſe come utterly to an end for evermore? Hath God forgotten to be
gracious; and will he ſhut up his loving kindneſs in diſpleaſure?</hi> Alas!
how often did I ſay, <hi>Have mercy upon me, O God, after thy great
goodneſs: according to the multitude of thy mercies, do away mine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences.
Caſt me not away from thy preſence; and take not thy holy
ſpirit from me. O give the comfort of thy help again; and eſtabliſh me
with thy free ſpirit,</hi> Pſal. 51. v. 1, 11, 12. I endeavour'd to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
my grief by conſidering the difference which St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> made
of thoſe who were faln. I knew the <hi>Ancients</hi> diſtinguiſh'd between
thoſe which were call'd <hi>Sacrificati,</hi> that is to ſay thoſe who had
ſacrificed to <hi>Idols</hi> and <hi>Thurificati,</hi> thoſe who had preſented <hi>Incenſe,</hi>
and <hi>Libellatici,</hi> thoſe who gave Money to the Judge, that they
might not go into the Temple of the <hi>Idols,</hi> and who afterwards
had a certain work to deliver themſelves from the Perſecution by
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40628:29"/>
cunning ſhift. I very well ſaw that I was of this laſt ſort, but
yet this did not ſatisfie me, becauſe I had not the courage to ſuffer
Perſecution for the ſake of my <hi>Saviour,</hi> which by the by, I deſire,
may be an admonition to thoſe who have eſcap'd it, by any Art
whatever, to look upon themſelves as great Sinners. Many may
ſay that they have not ſign'd any <hi>Abjuration,</hi> but I deſire them to
ask their Conſciences, whether they have done no Action, by
which they have deny'd their <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I conſider'd with my ſelf the <hi>Fall</hi> of many great men, who yet
afterwards glorified <hi>God</hi> by their Repentance. St. <hi>Peter</hi> was the
firſt who preſented himſelf to my Imagination: but I found my
Infidelity far greater than his. I forgot not the great <hi>Hoſius</hi> who
preſided at the Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> the love of his <hi>Sepulchre,</hi> as St.
<hi>Hillary</hi> elegantly calls it, meaning his <hi>Body,</hi> grown weak through
his great Age, made him ſign the deteſtable Hereſie of <hi>Arius.</hi>
But ſaid I, <hi>Hoſius</hi> becauſe of his Age was in a kind of dotage;
but thou was in the vigour of thy Mind. <hi>Liberius</hi> came next to
my Thoughts, but I perceiv'd it was only the uneaſineſs of <hi>Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
that made him fall. And that the fears of Death made <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rengarius</hi>
as well as <hi>Jerome</hi> of <hi>Prague recant,</hi> as alſo the great <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> Although there was no compariſon
betwixt theſe great men and me, but inregard of my fault, yet I
could not forbear making a parallel of their conduct with mine;
for at laſt, ſaid I to my ſelf, all theſe great Lights regain'd their
former brightneſs after they had been ſometime obſcur'd: But
miſerable that thou art, can thou expect that <hi>God</hi> ſhould raiſe thee,
ſeeing thou haſt ſo baſely forſaken him?</p>
            <p>In the exerciſe of ſuch thoughts as theſe did I paſs the greateſt
part of the time of my <hi>Baniſhment;</hi> they were interrupted by the
<hi>Curate</hi> of the place, who came to me about <hi>Whitſontide,</hi> to exhort
me by Order of Monſieur <hi>De Valence,</hi> to Communicate. He told
me <hi>Eaſter</hi> was paſt, and that it was his Duty to make me this
Exhortation, to the end I might do mine. He was accompanied
by two or three <hi>Prebends</hi> of <hi>Die,</hi> but they durſt not propoſe this
to me, fearing to engage with me. The <hi>Curate</hi> ſeemed much
diſturb'd while he ſpoke to me; I thank'd him for the care he
took of me, but that my Conſcience forced me to tell him that I
was not in a condition to do what he requir'd me; and that I
was ſurpriz'd that Monſieur <hi>De Valence</hi> ſhould give him this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
ſeeing I had ſo fully informed him of my intentions
therein. In good earneſt, Mr. <hi>Curate,</hi> would you oblige a Man
to Communicate that does not believe your Myſteries? Hereupon
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40628:29"/>
I made a long diſcourſe to him to let him know the Sentiments
of my Soul. When I had ended, he aroſe, and told me, he would
never while he lived ſpeak more to me about this Matter, but
that he was indiſpenſably obliged to let his Biſhop know all that
I had ſaid to him. This <hi>Curate</hi> was a Man of his word, for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſince, did he ever ſpeak to me of Religion.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, with an extream Paſſion I wiſh'd I might glorifie
<hi>God,</hi> either by a Retreat, or by Priſon, or by Death, <hi>God</hi> having
put it into my Heart, that I muſt ſuffer every thing, rather than
defile my ſelf by any act of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> It was upon this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
that I writ to the Biſhop of <hi>Valence,</hi> to let him know, that
I could no longer live being ſo horribly tormented with the <hi>Stone.</hi>
And truly, for ſeveral days I endured the pain of ſuch a ſtoppage
of Urine, that I could find no eaſe, till I had voided a Stone as
big as a Bean. This <hi>Prelate</hi> never ſaw me but in Bed, which I
uſually kept, as well for the eaſe of my Mind, as that of my
Body; for when I was up, I was in continual pain. By my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
I intreated him to get leave for me to go to <hi>Lyons</hi> to be cut.
He anſwer'd me very civilly, that with all his Heart he would uſe
his endeavour for that as well as for my entire eaſe. He prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied
without thinking on't; for the permiſſion which he obtain'd
ſome time after, was the cauſe of my deliverance, by which I
was diſcharg'd of a Stone, which I had in my Head, a thouſand
times more troubleſom than any that could afflict a Man in that
ſtrange Diſtemper. Every day ſeem'd a Year; I waited for this
Permiſſion with great impatience, and not hearing any News of
it, I again writ to the <hi>Biſhop</hi> to the ſame effect, and after a ſtrange
manner aggravated my evil. He got his deſire, and I mine. He
delay'd the time, that ſo my pains and anguiſh might determine
me to what he wiſh'd; but my thoughts were quite contrary.
Therefore while he deferr'd procuring me this ſatisfaction, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
by way of <hi>Grenoble,</hi> to find a favourable occaſion to
make my eſcape out of the Kingdom. God bleſs'd my Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
and heard my ardent Prayers. There was found for me
a Party, which to me ſeemed able enough to execute my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.
But when I had made all ready to be Tranſported by
Twelve <hi>Peaſants</hi> over the high Mountains, even to the ſide of the
<hi>Lizere,</hi> Advice was brought me, that <hi>Grenoble</hi> was full of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons,
and ſo that my Deſign was ruin'd. My Affliction was
great to have fail'd of my aim: But God, who Rules all things
by his wiſe <hi>Providence,</hi> was pleas'd to bar up this way againſt
me, that he might open me one more eaſie and commodious. I
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:40628:30"/>
knew not then, that I was under the Guard of the Chief Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
of the Neighbouring <hi>Corporations,</hi> to whom, it ſeems, the
Biſhop of <hi>Valence</hi> had given Order to take care that I made not
my eſcape. Infallibly I had been taken, if I had offered to go
away without expreſs leave, which a thouſand times has made
me adore the <hi>Providence</hi> and favourable Protection of my good
<hi>God</hi> over me.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of the Month of <hi>July</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Valence</hi>
came into his Dioceſs of <hi>Die,</hi> to bring his People to <hi>Confeſſion</hi> and
the <hi>Communion.</hi> A great many <hi>Troops</hi> came before him to uſe
<hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Violence</hi> towards thoſe who would not obey him. He
was no ſooner come, but he let a Friend of mine know, that
he had obtain'd the Permiſſion which I deſired, to go to <hi>Lyons.</hi>
As much as I was caſt down by my continual Tears, yet this
good News reviv'd me, and I plainly perceived my bodily pains
to diminiſh; from whence I infer'd that the great <hi>God</hi> would by
this means enable me to gain my end, which through his Aid I
have done. But in the midſt of this little Joy, I was ſtill troubled
in my Mind, fore-ſeeing that I ſhould meet with furious Attacks
from this Biſhop, either to force me to <hi>Sign,</hi> or do ſome other
thing againſt my Conſcience. I ſtrengthened my ſelf in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
that I had made, by the help of my Prayers, my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings,
and extraordinary Humiliation to conſent to nothing.
Theſe Pious Exerciſes made me a little ſenſible of the Grace of
<hi>God,</hi> and the effects of this <hi>Divine</hi> Comforter, which before had
withdrawn from my Soul.</p>
            <p>But before this Biſhop came to me, to Torment me, he went
the Circuit of his <hi>Dioceſs,</hi> where he exerciſed unheard-of Violence
to make People <hi>Confeſs</hi> and <hi>Communicate.</hi> The People eſcap'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Woods and Mountains; they were purſu'd thither, as if
they had been Wild Beaſts; they were knock'd down, bound
faſt, and then as quickly as they could were thrown into deep
Ditches. In a word, there was nothing heard but Deſolation
and Miſery. What <hi>Honour</hi> is this theſe Gentlemen do to their
<hi>Religion,</hi> to drag folks to the foot of their <hi>Altar,</hi> and make them
Sacrifice to their <hi>Idols?</hi> Heretofore <hi>God</hi> refuſed a <hi>Victim</hi> which
went not chearfully to the <hi>Altar;</hi> and can they expect that a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
made with an ill will by reaſonable Creatures can be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to him? They ſhall bear this Iniquity, and the great Judge
of the Univerſe will not fail to impute this crying ſin to them,
and to chaſtiſe theſe horible attempts. The beſt of it is, that
Monſieur <hi>De Valence</hi> ſet before the Eyes of theſe good People my
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40628:30"/>
Example to induce them to Confeſs, and to Communicate. What,
ſays he, are you wiſer than Monſieur <hi>De Chambrun?</hi> He hath
done every thing, and why do you refuſe to follow his Pattern?
At the ſame time I received from divers places Diſpatches to
know how it was. As I was never byaſs'd, ſo I anſwered, that
they ſhould take great heed not to give credit to ſuch Diſcourſes;
that I was reſolved to die, rather than give them this Scandal;
and that they need only to inform themſelves how I had behav'd
my ſelf, not to be catch'd with ſuch Cheats as theſe. Good God!
what Religion is this? What Biſhops are theſe, that dare add lies
to Violence, to deceive poor Innocents? And here, to the Glory
of my God, I muſt needs own, that what I did upon this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
was with ſingular Edification, and produc'd abundance of
good Effects, becauſe whole Societies or Corporations choſe rather
to expoſe themſelves to the Rage and Fury of the Dragoons, than
to <hi>Confeſs,</hi> and to <hi>Communicate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Comptroller</hi> of <hi>Dauphine</hi> about this time came to <hi>Die,</hi> to aſſiſt
the Biſhop in this fine <hi>Miſſion.</hi> The laſt preach'd by the Mouth
of the Dragoons, and the firſt ſued thoſe who would not obey.
Every day I heard that they ſent away Troops of Women and
Girles to that cruel Robber, who had committed a thouſand out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages
againſt ſo many poor Innocents who paſs'd through his
hands while I was at <hi>Valence.</hi> I was told that this <hi>Comptroller</hi> one
day as he was at Dinner diſcours'd of me. I am told, ſays he, that
this Miniſter which is at <hi>Romeyer,</hi> will do nothing, tho' he has
promis'd to Confeſs, and to Communicate, but we'll quickly bring
him to Reaſon. He has refuſed two thouſand Livres Penſion;
he is very nice, to deſpiſe the Favours of a great King. <hi>Mr. De
Vermenton,</hi> who was there alſo at Dinner, began to ſpeak, and
told him, Sir, you have him not yet; I have obſerved him till he
came at <hi>Valence,</hi> and I am perſwaded, that the extremity in which
I ſaw him made him ſay, that he would re-unite himſelf, but that
the ſecret meaning of his Heart is quite contrary.</p>
            <p>After the <hi>Biſhop</hi> had been the whole Circuit of his <hi>Dioceſs,</hi> he
failed not to come and ſee me: He came alone into my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and began to tell me, that he had obtain'd the Permiſſion
which I had ſo much wiſh'd: But before he would give it me,
I muſt make my ſelf ready to <hi>Sign, Confeſs,</hi> and <hi>Communicate.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
him, that I thank'd him for the care he had taken; but I
begg'd him to let me go in Peace to <hi>Lyons</hi> without further preſſing
me; that in likelihood I ſhould there die in the Operation of cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
me, and ſo ſhould give him no more trouble. He reply'd,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40628:31"/>
to me, What, Sir, the King is not to be thus mock'd; I have writ
to Court, that you were in good earneſt Converted, and what will
they ſay of me, if I do not make you do your Duty? I have cauſed
all the <hi>Miniſters</hi> which were at <hi>Die</hi> to <hi>Confeſs and Communicate,</hi> and
will you be the ſingular <hi>Huguenot</hi> in <hi>France?</hi> I anſwered him,
that I live not by Example. I have no intention to mock or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any body; you are too Reaſonable, Sir, to force me to do
a thing againſt my Conſcience; I beſeech you let me go to <hi>Lyons.</hi>
A little after, he took out of his Pocket a Book, in which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
had collected ſeveral Paſſages of the Fathers to prove the
<hi>real preſence</hi> of the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> There
were ſome of St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> St. <hi>Cyril,</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>
and divers others. As faſt as he read them, I immediately gave
him an Anſwer to them, but he did not reply the leaſt word to
my Anſwers. But he inſiſted particularly on that paſſage of St.
<hi>Auſtin,</hi> in his explication of <hi>33 Pſalm,</hi> according to the <hi>Vulgar</hi>
Edition, and the 34 according to the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> where this Father
did ſay, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt did bear or carry himſelf in his hands when
he gave his laſt Supper to his Diſciples. Se ipſum ferebat in manibus
ſuis.</hi> This paſſage appeared to him unanſwerable. What can be
ſaid, ſays he to me, to ſo ſtrong an expreſſion of St. <hi>Auguſtin?</hi> I
began to ſmile, and told him, that if I had here my St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi>
I would quicly let him ſee that what he fancied never entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the mind of that Father. How, ſays he, is your St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>
different from that which is cited here? No, Sir, ſaid I, and you
need but turn the leaf to ſee his Opinion. In the Expoſition fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
he lets us underſtand, that his People were offended at
theſe words; which was the reaſon he commented upon them in
that place I ſpeak of, and told them, <hi>Se ipſum quodammodo ferebat
in manibus ſuis. After a manner,</hi> &amp;c. Well, ſays he, let this paſs.
But here are others, to which there is no Reply. He purſu'd
reading his Book, without ever giving me any Reply to my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers.
He very well ſaw by my manner of acting, that he ſhould
not be able to gain any thing upon my Mind; and that all thoſe
paſſages which he alledged to me, were not capable to convince
me; which obliged him to ſhut his Book, and then he told me,
that as a Friend, he would adviſe me to obey the King, if not,
ſtrange ill things ſhould be done unto me; after which he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd
me, and bid me Farewel. The ſame Evening he ſent Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
to the Inhabitants of my Deſart, who committed a thouſand
diſorders to force them to do any thing. I concluded that I ſhould
be oppreſs'd by them as well as others; but inſtead of theſe trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40628:31"/>
Gueſts, the next Morning I ſaw come into my Chamber a
<hi>Jeſuite,</hi> ſent by him to endeavour to corrupt me. There came
before him a <hi>Canon,</hi> named <hi>Reinaud,</hi> to whom I ſaid ſo many
things about Religion, that in all appearance he had given Glory
to God in any other time. This <hi>Jeſuite</hi> made himſelf known to
me, in making me call to mind ſome Obſervations which I made
in one of my Sermons preach'd about <hi>Controverſie.</hi> Do you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
Sir, ſaid he, the two <hi>Anagrams</hi> upon <hi>Cornelius Janſenius,</hi>
and upon <hi>Joannes Calvinus?</hi> I have retain'd them, ſays he. Did
not you find in <hi>Cornelius Janſenius, Calvini ſenſus in ore,</hi> and in
<hi>Joannes Calvinus, An non es via Lucis?</hi> Yes, Sir, ſaid, I, the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of them is very freſh. Are you the Man with whom I had
then to do? Yes, ſays he, I am the very Man, and I come now
to offer you my Service. I come to tell you, that Monſier <hi>De Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi>
is extream angry with you; he talks of nothing but deep
Ditches, or ſending you to <hi>Pierre-Ciſe.</hi> I ſhould be very ſorry that
any ill ſhould come to you, for I can aſſure you, that I moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
Honour you, and that all our <hi>Fathers</hi> have a very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
eſteem for you. Believe me, Sir, and ſuffer not your ſelf to
be tormented; you need only make a little Confeſſion to me,
and I will ſpeedily go to <hi>Die</hi> and pacifie the Mind of Monſieur
<hi>De Valence.</hi> As to the Confeſſion of my ſins, ſaid I to him, I do
it every day to my God; and 'tis to him only I ought to do it,
according to the Opinion of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> in one of his Home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
upon the Epiſtle to <hi>Titus,</hi> where he ſays in Formal Terms, <hi>I
do not ask thee that thou ſhouldeſt confeſs thy ſins to me, it is to God
alone thou ought to confeſs them.</hi> And you know what St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>
ſays, <hi>Quid mihi cum hominibus ut peccata mea audiant tanquam mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bos
meos ſanaturi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will not, ſays he, diſpute with you. I know Sir that you
are my Maſter. The fear I am in leaſt any ill happen to you,
hath brought me hither to conjure you to have pity on your ſelf.
I fear nothing, ſaid I to him, I have put my ſelf into the hands
of <hi>God.</hi> Let him diſpoſe of me according to his Will. This Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite
put himſelf into all ſhapes, and acted all parts to bring me
to what he wiſht. He embrac'd he ſigh'd, he wept; but
all thoſe Artifices were in vain, and he was forced to withdraw
without being able to prevail over my Mind; but yet he was
not diſcourag'd for all this. The next Morning he came again,
and entred my Chamber, all frighted, as if the Dragoons had
been at his heels ready to carry me away and load me with
Chains. He employ'd all his Eloquence in a lively repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40628:32"/>
what would happen to me; nay, he went to my Wife to
terrify her by his Diſcourſe, and to ſollicite her to conjure me by
her Tears that I would prevent the miſchief that was preparing
for me. But he found himſelf every where rejected, ſo that he
went away the ſecond time without being able either by his Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
or his Threats to make the leaſt impreſſion on my Spirit. News
was brought me, that Monſieur <hi>De Valence</hi> was in a great paſſion
upon the report this Jeſuite had made to him, and ſaid, he knew
not what ſhould hinder him from cauſing me to be thrown into a
deep Ditch: that I troubl'd him more than all his Dioceſs: that
I might go to the Devil, and that at <hi>Lyons</hi> I ſhould meet with thoſe
that durſt talk to me. The next day he caus'd another onſet to
be made me, but ſeeing me immoveable, he gave order to one of
my friends to tell me, that I might go when I would to <hi>Lyons,</hi>
where the Archbiſhop had receiv'd Orders, and ſhould yet receive
more, to make me paſs my time uneaſily enough. And here one
ought to admire Providence in my behalf, that the Biſhop of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi>
who is one of our moſt bitter Perſecutors, ſhould let me
go out of his Dioceſs in the manner I did; for night and day I
ſaid my Prayers with a loud Voice, and in Company ſung Pſalms,
and exhorted every body to perſeverance, and all this too was
not unknown to him; beſides that he could never force me to
make the leaſt ſtep againſt my Conſcience; and that I ſhould
have diſputed againſt him, explicated my Opinions to his <hi>Curate,</hi>
to certain <hi>Canons,</hi> and to a Jeſuite; certainly in all this there
muſt be ſomething of Divine, and very extraordinary, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I have often with great diligence try'd to diſcover the ways
of God in this Affair. And after I had well conſider'd it, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that God made uſe of the Vanity of this Biſhop to bring
me out of my Miſery. He did write to <hi>Court</hi> that he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
me. He durſt not contradict himſelf, leaſt he ſhould paſs
for a man of little ſenſe; and beſides I verily believe that I hit
right of his Thoughts, if I ſay, that he argu'd with himſelf after
this manner. <hi>Every body believes that this man is really converted,
and I have taken care to ſpread this News throughout the Kingdom; if
we throw him into Priſon we give the Lye to what we have publiſh'd;
it is better to let him go to</hi> Lyons, <hi>where infallibly he'l dye in the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of his cutting, and ſo we ſhall be deliver'd of him, and after his
Death, we can ſay of him what we pleaſe.</hi> In all likelihood theſe
were his thoughts. But here <hi>God</hi> cries from Heaven, <hi>Your thoughts
are not my thoughts, neither are your ways my ways.</hi> The good Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
could never imagine that I <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>uld be able to do what I did;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40628:32"/>
he was an Eye-witneſs of all my Miſeries, and he knew that I
was rather a dead Carkaſs, than a living Man. He had little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to ſuſpect that which I had ſo vehemently deſir'd in my
Heart. But it is thus <hi>God</hi> confounds the Wiſdom of thoſe who
think themſelves wiſe.</p>
            <p>I had no ſooner the liberty to go to <hi>Lyons,</hi> but I left my Deſart
the firſt day of <hi>August</hi> 1686. carry'd in a <hi>Litter</hi> by twelve Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants.
The poor people of <hi>Diois</hi> came in Crowds to ſee me paſs
along the Road. I will not tell here, with how many Bleſſings,
and with what Tears I was accompanied. Every where I beheld
pale and dejected Looks, which fill'd me full of Compaſſion. I
endeavour'd to comfort them by my Prayers, and my Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
My people perceiv'd that I was follow'd from place to
place by the <hi>Curates</hi> and other Perſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who had receiv'd order
from Monſieur <hi>De Valence</hi> to watch me upon my way. Near the
Town of <hi>Creſt</hi> an honeſt man gave me information, and told
me that aſſuredly I would be ſtopt there. Notwithſtanding all
I ſtill perſu'd my way without the leaſt fear, and I got ſafe to
<hi>Lyons</hi> the fifth of the ſame Month, I took up my Lodging in a
great Inn, both to take away all ſuſpition; and alſo the better to
perſwade that I was there with a deſign to be cut of the Stone.
The next Morning I ſent to look for one call'd <hi>Hermite,</hi> a Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon
for the Stone, to know of him when he could cut me.
He view'd my Body, and after he had examin'd it well, he told
me it would be very dangerous to perform this Operation in the
condition I was in: but that he would conſult of the beſt-means
to do it. Here it was I met with a very pious Lady, who with
me ſhed abundance of Tears. She was juſt upon going for <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va.</hi>
I had ſo great confidence in her, that I told her my Deſign,
and injoyn'd her to beg the Paſtors of <hi>Geneva,</hi> to put up their
Prayers to God for me. She took me by the hands, and kiſſing
them, ſaid ſhe hoped that theſe ſame hands who had ſo often ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred
to her the Seal of Grace and Pardon might yet be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
in giving her the ſame Conſolation. This great Inn where
I went to Lodge was not convenient to execute my deſign; but a
private Houſe more convenient, was procur'd for me, where I was
no ſooner fixt, but I ſent for the ableſt Phyſitian in <hi>Lyons,</hi> whoſe
name is Mr. <hi>Falconnet,</hi> and of whom the Archbiſhop made uſe.
I gave him an account of all the Symptoms of my imaginary E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;
he concluded that I had the Stone, but that he muſt alſo
ſearch me for the greater certainty. He pitied the condition I
was in, and though I was a Stranger to him, yet he was extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40628:33"/>
friendly. He was a man of Learning, and I took great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in his Converſation. I cannot tell whether it was my illneſs,
or ſome obſervation which I made upon the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets,
which pleas'd him, and oblig'd him to be much with me.
But let it be what it will, he made uſe of all his Skill to give me
eaſe, and to pleaſe him; I told him I did find benefit by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.
It happen'd that as he was one day to viſit the <hi>Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,</hi>
he told him that he had a Patient who was a ſtranger to
him, but a Gentleman in a very bad condition. Without doubt,
ſays the <hi>Arch-biſhop,</hi> this muſt be a Miniſter of <hi>Orange,</hi> of whom
I have order from Court to look after, and calling to his Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
bid him bring his little Box of Papers, where he found the
ſaid Order. He communicated it to the Phyſitian on purpoſe
that he might tell it me, the ſubſtance of which was, that the
Archbiſhop ſhould not let me go from <hi>Lyons,</hi> and that he ſhould
take care that I held no <hi>Meeting;</hi> when this was ſignify'd to me, I
anſwer'd, that as for holding <hi>Meetings,</hi> my condition would not
let me run about the City; and for going from <hi>Lyons,</hi> they need
but look upon my Body to be ſatisfy'd in that point. But becauſe
I would avoid lying, I reſolv'd not to ſay, that I would not go
thence without Order.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, finding my ſelf ſo narrowly watcht, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
that I ſhould quickly be in <hi>Pierre-ciſe,</hi> if I did not take ſome
ſpeedy courſe. I had made a bargain with a Waggoner of <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
Counté,</hi> who promis'd me for a hundred <hi>Louiſes</hi> he would car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
me to <hi>Switzerland</hi> in his Waggon cloath'd like a Peaſant, and
as if I was his Servant, and that the Waggon had run over me
and broke my Legs. Several of my Friends were againſt this
way for two reaſons; the firſt, that I ſhould never be able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
ſo long a Journey in the Waggon; and the ſecond that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo ſtrictly obſerv'd as I was, I ſhould be no ſooner miſt in
<hi>Lyons,</hi> but immediately they would diſpatch Meſſengers upon all
the great Roads, and that the great diſtance between <hi>Lyons</hi> and
<hi>Switzerland</hi> by way of the <hi>Franche Counte,</hi> would undoubtedly
cauſe my being taken; and ſo that I ought rather to think of
ſome way both quicker and ſhorter. After much thinking, I
fancy'd that I ſhould certainly gain my point, if I went out Poſt
in a <hi>Callech,</hi> with the attendance of ſome great Lord, my great
diſtemper oppos'd this deſign; for indeed it was very plain, that
without an extraordinary aſſiſtance from Heaven, I could never
ſucceed. Nay, there were ſome that ever laught at me when I
propos'd it. But in ſhort, notwithſtanding all their Arguments,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40628:33"/>
I was ſo well confirm'd in my deſign, that the very ſame day I
caus'd a <hi>Callech</hi> to be bought for me, and order'd it to come by
a private way. I had a mind to try whether I could endure this
ſort of travelling, that ſo I might not hazard my ſelf to no purpoſe.
I went upon the <hi>Key</hi> by the River ſide, and as ſoon as I perceiv'd
<hi>Pierre-ciſe,</hi> where my dear Brethren and Collegues are kept, I
could not poſſibly forbear weeping, a whole torrent of Tears fell
from me, as well in compaſſion of the ſad condition of perſons
ſo dear to me, as at the remembrance of my own fault which
deprives me of the ſweet comfort of enjoying the Company of
ſuch bleſſed Confeſſors.</p>
            <p>If my Nephew had not earneſtly ſollicited me to quit that
place, and give ſome intermiſſion to my Tears, I believe I ſhould
not have ſtirr'd from thence before night. I had not gone thence
thirty paces before an Officer was at my heels, and commanded
me to retire home. This accident ſurpriz'd me, and let me ſee
that I was narrowly watcht, being I was ſo cloſely follow'd the
firſt time of my coming abroad. But indeed my Servants had
often told me, that they had obſerv'd certain perſons hovering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
my Houſe which they ſuſpected to be Serjeants. This made
me tell my Wife, that I was now ſatisfy'd that I had ſpies ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me; but yet that I would ſo well time my buſineſs, that I
would ſteal from the ſight of my Guards. And that I might
the better ſucceed, I ſent for my Doctor, and told him that my
Pains were ſo exceſſive that I could no longer live. He was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
by his Son, and the <hi>Operator</hi> who was to ſearch me.
This was the fifth of <hi>September</hi> that I endur'd this cruel Operation.
The <hi>Operator</hi> could find no Stone, and for his excuſe, pretended
that my lying croſs the Bed was not a fit poſture to perform it, and
that he muſt ſearch me in a Chair. I beg'd the Doctor to put
off this ſecond ſearch to another time; that I had ſuffer'd ſo much
in the firſt, that I did not feel my ſelf ſtrong enough to undergo
a ſecond, and the ſeaſon in the Month of <hi>October</hi> would be cooler,
and ſo more favourable to me. This was approv'd of, and thus
I got rid of my Doctor, and my Operator. But this Operation
made me endure two terrible nights, yet this did not hinder for
putting my Affairs in order to go away the <hi>Sunday</hi> following,
which was the eighth of the ſame Month. A particular perſon for
whom I ſhall all my life pray, lent me two Footmen, with order
to do whatſoever I bid them. He ſet them out very handſomly,
and at my own coſt I fitted two others ſuitable to them. The two
firſt I thought fit to call <hi>Pariſien</hi> and <hi>Campagne,</hi> and thoſe two
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40628:34"/>
which belong'd to me, I nam'd <hi>Flower</hi> and <hi>River.</hi> As for my
ſelf, I was in a Suit cover'd with Gold, a Hat edg'd with Gold,
a fair Perriwig, and a point of Venize Cravat, with a Scarlet
Ribbon. The Horſes that were neceſſary for me, I procur'd and
ſent them out of the City, and kept only two for my ſelf and
Boy. I fancied that the beſt time I could take would be about
ſeven a Clook in the Evening, when every body was taking their
pleaſure in walking. My Wife and I pray'd together, and after
I had embrac'd her full of Tears, I caus'd my ſelf to be put in
my <hi>Callech</hi> which was there ready for me, conjuring her to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the ſame moment from that Houſe to another I had prepar'd
for her. My grief was extream to forſake a perſon ſo dear to me,
and who had been ſo great comfort to me in all my Afflictions:
but as ſhe could not ride Poſt, as I did, I took care that another
party ſhould aſſiſt her, and in a few days to follow me.</p>
            <p>At the hour reſolv'd on I began my Journey. I paſs'd quite
through that great City in the midſt of an incredible throng of
<hi>People. Calleches</hi> and <hi>Coaches,</hi> and upon a good round Trot quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
came to the end of the Bridge of <hi>Roſne,</hi> whither a friend
had follow'd me at a ſmall diſtance to obſerve whether I was
known; but he told me all was well, ſo we ſhak'd hands and
bid adieu. At the ſame time I commanded my Footman to
mount his Horſe and make the beſt of his way. It was juſt night
when I came up to my other Footmen with five Horſes, who
waited for me behind the Ruines of a Houſe; they preſently
harnaſs'd another Horſe and added him to my <hi>Callech,</hi> and all
being mounted, we purſu'd our way with a ſtrange expedition, I
was made faſt to my <hi>Callech</hi> with two leather Thongs, which kept
me ſo cloſe to my Engine, that it was impoſſible to know that I
was indiſpos'd. Order was given to <hi>Pariſien,</hi> who was a witty
fellow, always to ride before, and to get the Poſt Horſes ready,
and never to ſpeak of any but my <hi>Lord,</hi> who travail'd in great
haſt upon urgent Affairs. This little precaution ſucceeded won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully.
I always found the Horſes ready at my coming to the
Stages; I was call'd nothing but my <hi>Lord.</hi> This together with
my great Liberality to the Poſtillions, carry'd me with ſuch dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
that at break of day I arriv'd at the Bridge of <hi>Beauvoiſin.</hi>
All that night I employ'd in ſinging the Praiſes of God, I began
with the <hi>91 Pſalm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being come to the Bridge of <hi>Beauvoiſin,</hi> I could get but two
Poſt-Horſes; a Courrier that I had met upon the Road, who
carried the News of the Creation of <hi>Cardinals,</hi> had taken the reſt.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40628:34"/>
I found <hi>Pariſien</hi> engaged with the Poſt-Maſter; I heard him
ſay as I arriv'd, <hi>My Lord will not be thus content; You muſt find
Horſes at any rate.</hi> The good Man immediately came up to me,
and calling me, <hi>My Lord,</hi> askt my Pardon a thouſand times, that
he could not preſently furniſh me with Horſes neceſſary for me;
but in a little time I ſhould have enough very fit for my Service.
I made as if I was very Angry, and it may be I was ſo in good
earneſt, and told him, that the Service of the King ought not
thus to be hindred. He begg'd me to walk into a Room, where
I might be more at my eaſe. I briskly anſwer'd him, that I
muſt go forward. While he was arguing with me, the People
of the Town, who began to get out of their Beds, flocked about
my <hi>Callech,</hi> to make their Obſervations of it, and my Equipage.
They paid abundance of Reſpect, taking me for a <hi>Lord.</hi> I ſtir'd
my Hat a little to them, and then ſat cover'd, letting them ſtand
bare-head, the better to perſwade them that I was ſome great
<hi>Lord.</hi> After I had askt ſomething for Breakfaſt, tho' I had no
ſtomack at all to any, I invited them to drink my Health. I hope
I ſhall be excuſed, if here I do not relate all the particulars of
what I did and ſaid upon this Adventure: Let it ſuffice to ſay,
that I left the Quality of a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> to take that of a great Officer
of the Army. And truly, my manner of Acting did ſo well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
all thoſe ſort of People of being ſuch, that thoſe who had
the Guard of the Bridge, and the Commiſſaries of the Cuſtom-Houſe,
askt my Nephew, if I did not Command the Regiment
of Guards to the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> It may be ſo, ſays he to them.
Yes, we did think ſo indeed, reply'd theſe Commiſſaries to him;
we have ſeen him paſs this way heretofore, he hath good Fortune
in his looks. While this Dialogue laſted, I was in great diſquiet
of Mind, for I had been tarrying there near two hours, and
could get no Horſes, notwithſtanding my earneſt preſſing for
them. But at laſt they came, and all things being ready, the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillion
turned to me, and askt if I would pleaſe to go a good
pace; we had need, ſaid I to him, to redeem the Time we have
loſt. I paſs'd the Bridge as quick as could be through the midſt
of a dozen Souldiers, who were upon the Guard, and who open'd
for me to the right, and to the left. The Joy I had to ſee my
ſelf out of a Kingdom, where I had ſo much ſuffered, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable:
I rais'd up my Heart to offer my moſt humble thanks
to God, and ſang the <hi>125 Pſalm.</hi> But when I thought my ſelf
entirely delivered from the hands of my Enemies, there fell out
an Accident which I no way expected. At the entry into that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40628:35"/>
inacceſſable Rock, which a Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> cauſed to be cut to

ſaid I, to be thrown into a Ditch as well as thou, for
leaving his Poſt. Let him be called, and let him come and ſpeak
to me. They called him; but whether the Threats that I had
made frighted him, I know not, however he was ſatisfied to call
out to his People, To let my <hi>Lord</hi> paſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This word reviv'd my
Heart, which before began to grow ſad. It was no ſooner pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd,
but I commanded my Poſtillion to make all haſte poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.
I paſs'd through <hi>Chambery</hi> with all ſpeed, only ſtopt a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to mend my <hi>Callech.</hi> And although I muſt croſs the Country,
yet I made uſe of Poſt-Horſes to carry me even to <hi>Geneva.</hi> The
bad Ways, and the Precipices which in this Country one meets
with, made me go more ſlowly than I deſired, leſt I ſhould be
purſued by ſome <hi>Courrier.</hi> Sometimes it was neceſſary to make
uſe of the Country Folks to hold up my <hi>Callech</hi> in the ill way,
for I had very often liked to have been over-turn'd. But yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all theſe Toils and Dangers, the great God, who
hath viſibly ſuſtain'd me, brought me ſafe to <hi>Geneva</hi> about Six a
Clock in the Morning. I was hardly upon the Bridge of <hi>Arve,</hi>
but I found my Heart began to melt into Tears for my Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
I began to give Thanks to this Divine <hi>Protector,</hi> in ſinging
the <hi>8th.</hi> Verſe of the <hi>26 Pſalm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I cannot omit one Remarkable thing; the very laſt
ſtep which the Horſes made after they were within the Inn, one
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40628:35"/>
of the ſhafts of my <hi>Callech</hi> broke ſhort in the middle; upon which
I made this Reflection, That God, by this ſilent Voice, told me,
it was he who had ſuſtained and carried me in his Hands, ſince
there was much more likelihood, that this Accident ſhould have
happened in the midſt of Rocks and Precipices. I reflected alſo,
how weary all my People were, and yet that I was as freſh as
when I left <hi>Lyons,</hi> notwithſtanding all my indiſpoſitions. For
this I rendred my hearty thanks to God, as well as for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
he had given me.</p>
            <p>Though I had taken great care to be private here, yet the noiſe
of my Arrival was quickly ſpread all over <hi>Geneva.</hi> They came
in Crouds to Congratulate my Eſcape.</p>
            <p>Amongſt all the Conſolations which I received at <hi>Geneva,</hi> I
ought to reckon that which I had by Communicating the next
Sunday after my Arrival, as the greateſt and moſt efficacious. But
before I did this, I preſented my ſelf before four of the Faithful
Servants of God, to whom I opened my whole Heart, and by
my Tears gave them ſo many marks of my Repentance, that
they could not forbear mixing ſome of theirs with mine. I was
admitted to the Communion of the <hi>Church</hi> by theſe four Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Perſons. The Dean, whom I eſteem as my Father, made
a Prayer ſo ardent, and ſo ſenſible, and directed a Diſcourſe to
me ſo piercing, that I believe I ſhall never receive that Pleaſure
and Comfort which I did at that time. The Thurſday before
the Communion I was carried into the Temple of <hi>Magdalen.</hi> To
tell the raviſhing Joy I had at my entring into this Holy Place is
impoſſible. I was very ſenſible of it, but I cannot expreſs it.
According to their ordinary courſe they ſung the <hi>86 Pſalm.</hi> It
ſuited ſo exactly to my Condition, that I thought the Paſtor had
choſen it on purpoſe to comfort me. There was not one Verſe
which I did not apply to my ſelf; and I ſhed ſo many Tears in
ſinging it, that all thoſe who ſaw me, wept with me, as they
have often acknowledged to me. It was in the Temple of St.
<hi>Peter</hi> that I receiv'd the Communion. I hope I communicated
worthily, ſince I preſented to God <hi>a broken and a contrite heart,
Pſal.</hi> 51. which, according to holy <hi>David,</hi> is the Sacrifice which
God requires of us.</p>
            <p>After I had rendred to God part of these Acknowledgments I
owe him, in order to the making my Peace with him, I thought
I was indiſpenſibly obliged to give notice to the Prince my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of my Eſcape. Here follows that Letter which I took the
freedom to write to him.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THE Compaſſion which your <hi>Royal Highneſs</hi> was pleaſed
to take of all my Miſeries, and the goodneſs with which
you gave me aſſurance of it by <hi>Mr. Schulemburg,</hi> makes me pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
to acquaint you with ſome good News. I am, Sir, by
the Grace of God, delivered from my Slavery and hard Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude;
for by a ſtrange Miracle I find my ſelf among my
Brethren in the City of <hi>Geneva.</hi> But before I relate my eſcape
to your <hi>Royal Highneſs,</hi> I moſt humbly beſeech you to permit
me in few words to give you an Account of what paſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
me, ſince my unhappy <hi>Fall.</hi> In the Letter which I
took the Liberty to write you in that time, I acquainted you
that I was ſtill detain'd in the City of <hi>Valence,</hi> where they kept
me for the ſpace of two Months and a half, though they would
perſwade me that I had my full Liberty. During this, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
viſited me eight times. I always let him know that he had
made no great Conqueſt; that my great Infirmities were the
cauſe of thoſe words which fell from me, and that Day and
Night I wept for the fault I had committed; I pray'd him not
to preſs me to any Profeſſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
delivered from my Weakneſſes, I was a Man that could
ſpeak for my ſelf. We often diſputed together; and on theſe
Occaſions I was very ſenſible of the Divine Aſſiſtance to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Truth I had preach'd. In one of his Viſits he ſhewed
me a Letter, in which Monſieur <hi>De Louvoy</hi> writ him, that I
ſhould be allowed a Penſion of two Thouſand <hi>Livres,</hi> if I would
give any aſſurance of Fidelity to the <hi>King.</hi> I Anſwer'd him
couragiouſly, that I had rather feed upon Graſs, than accept
of any Penſion; and that I would chuſe rather to die, than
be thought a Man, who like ſo many others, had ſold his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and his Conſcience; that as mean a Man as I was, I had
enough to keep me, and ſo thanked him for the kindneſs he
thought to do me. It would be too tedious to tell your <hi>Royal
Highneſs</hi> all that paſt in our other Converſation, and common
Prudence will not let me commit to Paper many things which
I may tell your <hi>Royal Highneſs,</hi> if <hi>God</hi> gives me leave, as with
Paſſion I wiſh it, to come near your Sacred Perſon. At the
end of two Months and a half, they put me in a frightful <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart,</hi>
ſtill telling me that I enjoy'd my full Liberty. It was here
I lived five full Months, feeding upon my Sighs and Tears. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
I had been there a Month, the ſame Biſhop came to ſee
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40628:36"/>
me, and feigning my ſelf grievouſly troubled with the Stone,
I beg'd him to get leave for me to go to <hi>Lyons</hi> to be cut. He
delay'd me with fair Promiſes for four Months, but at laſt wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with my importunity, he writ to Court, and was anſwer'd,
that they might let me go to <hi>Lyons</hi> to be cut of the Stone, but
charged him to take care how I behaved my ſelf there. As I
was preparing my ſelf for my Journey, he came once more
into his Dioceſs of <hi>Die,</hi> to Confeſs and Communicate thoſe
which were called <hi>New Converts.</hi> And he came again to my
<hi>Deſart,</hi> to exhort me to do my <hi>Duty,</hi> as they call it. He br<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ught
along with him a Book newly compoſed to ſupport by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Fathers, their Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> As
faſt as he read the paſſages to me, I anſwer'd them, ſo that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me reſolv'd to do nothing of all that he requir'd of me, he
ſent to me ſome Jeſuits and other Eccleſiaſticks, whoſe Labours
prevail'd as little upon my Mind, as he had done. This vext
him ſo extreamly, that he threatned me ſeverely, and ſpoke of
nothing but throwing me in a Ditch, and by way of Favour,
into <hi>Pierre-ciſe.</hi> But yet notwithſtanding all his Anger, I left
my Deſart, and went to <hi>Lyons;</hi> whether he caus'd me to be
follow'd and watch'd by his Curates and other Perſons. I was
no ſooner arriv'd there, but I ſent for, and conſulted the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt
<hi>Phyſicians</hi> and <hi>Operators</hi> about the beſt means to cut me. I
ſuffer'd them even with their Inſtruments to ſearch me; and
the Phyſicians having acquainted the Archbiſhop with my piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
condition, he ſent me word that he had orders to obſerve
my Actions, and that I ſhould take heed not to hold any <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
at <hi>Lyons;</hi> this did not hinder me from thinking of my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape.
And the great God heard my Prayers, and put a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
into my head, how to be deliver'd from my ſevere cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
which one day I hope to relate to your <hi>Royal Highneſs.</hi>
But, Sir, that a man depriv'd of the uſe of his Limbs, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
watch'd by Officers, ſhould yet get out of <hi>Lyons,</hi> and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
at <hi>Geneva,</hi> by ways through Rocks, and in the ſight of
Guards, in two days time, add to this, that he ſhould be able
to endure the fatigue of riding Poſt in a <hi>Callech,</hi> and tire four
Servants well fitted, and ſhould never meet with one Soul that
ſo much as askt <hi>Whither goes thou?</hi> except at one place where I
was ſtopt ſome few minutes, and from whence I clear'd my
ſelf by perſonnating a reſolute Man of Honour; and that they
ſhould every where take me for ſome great Officer; and that I
ſhould be able to hide my Illneſs and Diſtempers, and never
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40628:37"/>
come out of my <hi>Callech;</hi> this doubtleſs will appear like a Fable
to all <hi>Europe;</hi> but as for my own part, I ſhall look upon't as
the work of the great God, who hath given his Holy Angels
charge to bear me up in their Hands. This, Sir, is a ſhort A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment
of my Hiſtory; I expected when I ſhould come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another Country to be regarded as a Dog for my <hi>falling</hi> away.
But God who hath without doubt had Mercy on me, hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
things quite otherwiſe; I can aſſure your <hi>Royal Highneſs,</hi>
that I have been receiv'd in this City, as if I were an Angel
from Heaven. Nay, I am very much troubl'd with People
who come in great numbers to ſhed Tears of Joy for my Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance;
inſomuch, that the firſt <hi>Syndic</hi> hath earneſtly preſs'd
me to Lodge in his Houſe, but for ſeveral reaſons I have refus'd
it, and acknowledge to him that I was very ſenſible it was for
the ſake of my <hi>Great Maſter</hi> he was deſirous to do me this honour,
and aſſured him I would not fail to let him know it. But, Sir,
this is not all, for within two days after my Arrival, the news
of it was ſpread all over <hi>Switzerland,</hi> and continually I receiv'd
from thence Letters of welcome: And that which fills up the
meaſure of my Joy, is to hear that your <hi>Royal Highneſs</hi> is pleas'd
with my Eſcape. But as there is nothing which I wiſh, with
greater paſſion, than to be near your Perſon, and that methinks
I ſhould then be content to die, if once God would pleaſe to
let me behold him whom I moſt Love, Reſpect and Honour in
the World; but then on the other ſide as my unhappy fall makes
me dread appearing before my <hi>Great Maſter,</hi> ſo I ſhall wait for
the Orders which you will pleaſe to ſend me, before I dare
begin my Journey. I hope, Sir, and this hope is my comfort
in the midſt of my great Affliction, that you who are ſo bright
an Image of <hi>God</hi> upon Earth, as well by your <hi>Greatneſs,</hi> as by
your <hi>Piety,</hi> will ſhew Mercy to your Servant; as I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
God himſelf has done to me. For this reaſon, I throw
my ſelf into the Arms of your <hi>Royal Highneſſes</hi> Goodneſs and
Charity, from whence I hope for all the Favour imaginable,
being aſſured that you are throughly convinc't that there is not
any of your Subjects, or Servants, who is with greater Obligation
and Veneration,than</p>

Within a few days after my arrival at <hi>Geneva,</hi> I receiv'd abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Letters of Congratulation, which perſons of great Merit
did me the honour to write me. I could produce divers of them,
which would not be a little for the Edification of the World, if
I had not ſome good reaſons which hinder me to publiſh them.
Several fugitive Paſtors diſpers'd in <hi>Switzerland</hi> did me the honour
in perſon to come and rejoyce with me. All this did but renew
my Tears, for I think my ſelf unworthy of ſo much goodneſs as
was ſhewn to me. But the Charity of theſe good Servants of God
extended a great deal farther; for as I ſignified to them, that
there was nothing I deſir'd more earneſtly than to be reſtor'd to
the Holy Miniſtry from whence through my fault I was faln, ſo
there were ſome of remarkable Merit, who maintain'd, that as I
had neither ſign'd, nor exercis'd any Act in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion,
ſo that they judg'd that I was not ſo faln, but that I might perform
my Miniſtry, without being re-eſtabliſh'd; and that I might
without the leaſt ſcruple do my function whenever God was
pleas'd to give me opportunity: nevertheleſs, I was not ſatisfy'd
with this, but told them, that I perceiv'd by this, they deſign'd
to comfort me, and conjur'd them not to flatter me in my Sin;
and that I had need of being more humbled by their Reproaches
for my horrible Cowardice; and that far from extenuating my
Crime, they ought rather to aggravate it. <hi>Let the Righteous,</hi> ſaid
I, <hi>Pſal. 141. 5. Smite me, it ſhall be a kindneſs; and let him reprove
me, it ſhall be an excellent Oyl, which ſhall not break my head.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this they all appointed a general Meeting, where I appear'd
before them, and where I ſpoke more by my Tears, and my
Sighs, than by my Words. I made them a ſhort relation of all
my ſad misfortunes, and of all that I could remember, that I ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did or ſaid during my Captivity; and beg'd them to make an
exact enquiry into all, as well for the Edification of the Church
of God, as for my own Comfort and Satisfaction; and in a word,
I aſſur'd them, that if my weak condition would allow me to caſt
my ſelf to the ground, I would there humble my ſelf in Duſt,
and of God ask pardon for my Sin, and of the whole Church par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for the ſcandal I have given. After the Formalities uſual up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
theſe occaſions were perform'd, I was re-eſtabliſh'd in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Holy Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>The ſupport and Charity of my Brethren was a very great
comfort to me: I thought my ſelf quite another man after this
re-eſtabliſhment; yet nevertheleſs I found my Soul continually to
groan under the heavy burden of my Sin; and I was alſo now
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40628:38"/>
tormented with the fear left my Wife ſhould be taken, ſhe was
to have follow'd me in a few days, and yet there were ſeveral
gone, and did not ſo much as hear that ſhe was ready to come
away from <hi>Lyons,</hi> a little to divert my Grief, and to pay my Duty
to the <hi>Count De Dona:</hi> I made ſome little Journies to <hi>Copet,</hi> where
I was by this Illuſtrious Lord and his Lady, receiv'd with all the
kindneſs and marks of good Will, that it is poſſible to imagine;
this <hi>Lord,</hi> whoſe Anceſtors from Father to Son have always ſhew'd
great favour to my Family, omitted nothing that he thought
would comfort me in this my extream Affliction; for I was no
ſooner in his Preſence, but a ſtood of Tears hindred me at the firſt
ſight of him, to give him that reſpect which is owing to his rare
Virtues and Merits. It was at his Houſe I receiv'd the anſwer
of the Letter which I writ to his <hi>Royal Highneſs:</hi> Monſieur <hi>De
Schulemberg</hi> ſent me word, that the Prince was extream joyful
at my eſcape, that I ſhould immediately come away for <hi>Holland;</hi>
and that orders were given at <hi>Geneva</hi> to furniſh me with all things
that ſhould be neceſſary. And indeed, this great Maſter hath
ſhew'd ſo much goodneſs to me, that it is through his generous
Liberality, that I have been able to bear the exceſſive Charge
which I was forc'd to be at, in getting my Wife from <hi>Lyons,</hi> and
my ſelf to be near his Perſon, in purſuance of the command
which he ſent me.</p>
            <p>At my return from this little Journey to <hi>Copet,</hi> I found at <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva</hi>
divers Letters from <hi>France,</hi> in which Perſons of great worth
rejoyced with me at my happy eſcape. They alſo let me know
how glad an infinite of good Souls were at this News, and what
grief my Perſecutors had, that I ſhould ſteal from them in their
very ſight. They alſo acquainted me with the Diſcourſe that was
among the <hi>great ones</hi> upon this occaſion; and yet after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
ſome of them reaſon'd. <q>Who would ever have thought
that ſo lame and weak a man in his Body, would have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
to run away, or that he had the courage to expoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſo ſtrangely as he has done? In all likelihood there is ſome
Secret in this matter; without doubt 'tis the <hi>Prince of Orange,</hi>
who hath caus'd him to eſcape, and with a great expence of
Money has corrupted the <hi>Guards.</hi>
               </q> The greateſt occaſion which
I found in theſe Letters to rejoyce at, was the good effect which
my eſcape has produced; for this has not only awak'd ſome Minds
which before ſeem'd to be aſleep, but in imitation of me, the
moſt fearful Perſons have had Courage enough to fly the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:40628:38"/>
But whilſt I was buſie in anſwering ſo many Letters, I receiv'd,
divers from my Wife, which much afflicted me; ſhe gave me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
that thoſe ſhe had agreed with, prov'd unfaithful to her;
that the Captain of that Quarter, at midnight entred the Houſe
where ſhe was with an intention to ſeize her; and that ſhe ſav'd
her ſelf from him, in hiding her ſelf in a Pile of Faggots: But that
ſhe was yet in great fear that ſhe ſhould fall into the hands of
thoſe he employs to perſecute us; becauſe it was known that ſhe
lay hid in <hi>Lyons.</hi> I neglected nothing to get her out of the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to which ſhe was expos'd; and at laſt I thought I had met
with a ſafe convenience to bring her to <hi>Geneva;</hi> but ſhe fell into
the hands of dishoneſt People, where ſhe narrowly eſcap'd Ruin.
In the Night, after they had travel'd two hours from <hi>Lyons,</hi> her
Guides forſook her and three Ladies, who were in her Company
and Deſign. Theſe poor Creatures were nine days going from
<hi>Lyons</hi> to <hi>Geneva,</hi> endur'd the rigour of the Winter, walk'd in Snow,
upon the Ice, and over Mountains, waited for by thirty armed
Peaſants at certain paſſages, and cloſely purſued by an Officer,
her Companions ſeeing themſelves beſet with ſuch Dangers, would
fain have return'd back to <hi>Lyons;</hi> but ſhe couragiouſly oppos'd them,
declaring to them, that ſhe had much rather periſh than go back;
for which reſolution, ſhe has had from theſe <hi>Ladies</hi> a thouſand
Praiſes and Thanks, after their arrival at <hi>Geneva.</hi> I had notice
from <hi>Lyons</hi> of the day of her coming away; her tarrying ſo long
made me believe ſhe was taken, which infinitely afflicted me,
thinking that if this misfortune was befaln her, that they would
uſe her cruelly upon my account. But this great <hi>God</hi> who hath
every way comforted me, hath reſtor'd her to me, even then when
I concluded ſhe was loſt; for the very minute when they were
at ſhutting the Gates, which was the laſt day of the year 1686, a
Souldier of the <hi>Gariſon</hi> came in all haſt, and brought me the
news of her Arrival, and the next moment I ſaw her at my bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
where my illneſs kept me. Our Joy was extream, and we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
gave ſolemn Thanks to this great <hi>God,</hi> who to our mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
comfort hath ſo mightily aſſiſted and bleſt us.</p>
            <p>After this unhop'd for happineſs, I thought of nothing but my
Journey for <hi>Holland;</hi> I ſet forward the firſt of <hi>February</hi> the year
following, notwithſtanding the rigour of the Seaſon, but the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of Snow, and the earneſt Sollicitations of the <hi>Count De
Dona</hi> and his <hi>Counteſs,</hi> ſtaid us at <hi>Copet,</hi> where I and my Wife
were receiv'd with a thouſand marks of Kindneſs by theſe Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
Perſons. From the Windows of this agreeable Seat I could
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40628:39"/>
divert my ſight upon the <hi>Lake Leman,</hi> and upon the inacceſſible
Rocks of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> which brought to my remembrance the Poem
of <hi>Beza,</hi> which is found at the head of ſome of our Pſalms; for
every day I heard the poor Fugitives, as they paſs'd upon the <hi>Lake,</hi>
ſinging Pſalms to their God, which reſounded to the Banks, and
eccho'd into the midſt of theſe horned Rocks. Methought I heard
the Quire of <hi>Angels,</hi> which is repreſented to us in the <hi>Revelations,</hi>
ſinging <hi>Allelujahs,</hi> which even pierc'd Heaven, giving thanks to
<hi>God</hi> for the deliverance of theſe poor Fugitives, and begging that
his gracious Protection might accompany them whetherſoever
it pleas'd his good Providence to direct them. I purſu'd my way
by <hi>Lauſane,</hi> where I met with a great number of Illuſtrious <hi>Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi>
and with whom I mixt my Tears; and I was receiv'd with
ſo great kindneſs by the renown'd Family of <hi>Chabot Chandieu,</hi>
and by Mr. <hi>Du Vernan,</hi> ſo celebrated for his Zeal, his Piety, and
his rare Merit, that I ſhall eternally preſerve the Memory of it.</p>
            <p>In all the Cities of <hi>Switzerland</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> I was moſt kindly
entertain'd. I no ſooner ſhew'd the Paſs-port of the <hi>Prince</hi> my
Maſter, but they offer'd me a thouſand Services, and I had ſo
much honour done me, that I was even aſham'd; but there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
to me in this long and tedious Journey a very ſad accident,
as I was laid in the <hi>Horſe-Litter,</hi> which was the only way I could
endure to travel; one of the Horſes fell, and I fell with ſo great
Violence upon my Face, that I remain'd as Dead; all my Body was
ſo bruis'd with this fall, and the Nerves of my Legs and my Arms ſo
very much hurt, that the pains which I felt differ'd but little from
thoſe of the <hi>Rack.</hi> Nevertheleſs the impatience that I was in to
be at the <hi>Hague,</hi> would not let me looſe one day, and the eight and
twentieth day of <hi>March</hi> I arriv'd there, whether <hi>God</hi> hath viſibly
by his good Providence conducted me.</p>
