            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Faith,</hi> to note, that there is not any Chriſtian, who can hope for life by him, who doth not ſight under his Banner: knowing, that if the Tempter did dare to fall upon our Generall, he will be ſure to aſſault his Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If he ſtruck at the head, he will not faile to lay at thoſe that are his members, and that it will be our part accordingly <hi>to reſiſt the Devill.</hi> And how ſo? but by <note place="margin">Jam<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now after the reference to the Tempter, let us, from the relation of the word <hi>[And,]</hi> take notice of the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the temptation; which was, as I ſaid, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of the place, for the Devill now, as it is in the former verſe, had Chriſt on the pinacle of the Temple, <hi>And</hi> now <hi>ſaith unto him.</hi> There is no circumſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Temptation, wherein the Devill doth not ſhew his policy, as here we ſee in the choice of the place to begin his temptation, whilſt he hath him <hi>in the wilderneſſe</hi> alone without any ſecond to annimate him. Next, on <hi>the top of a high mountaine,</hi> that he might more eaſily take a compendious view of the whole world; and then, <hi>on the pinacle of the Temple,</hi> as the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt place to try an experiment by caſting himſelfdown. But this was an artificiall pinacle, which occaſioneth a conſideration of a Morall pinacle, and a ſpirituall ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting down in three kinds far more agreeable to our diſcourſe. Firſt, Deviliſh, the Devil himſelf being both actour and author; Actour in himſelf, who, becauſe <note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note>he would be equal with <hi>the higheſt,</hi> and ſo a <hi>pinacle,</hi> caſt himſelf down into the loweſt hell: Authour to others by tempting our firſt Parents to be like unto God, which wrought the break-neck of all man-kinde. The
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54320:4"/>
ſecond is a <hi>Popiſh pinacle,</hi> the man of Rome, appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting unto himſelf many titles proper onely to Chriſt the Sonne of God, which are ſet down in Epiſtles, and Orations dedicated unto him and publiſhed by his <note place="margin">Bzovius lib. Pontificatus.</note>Oratour <hi>Bzovius</hi> of late, as to be called <hi>The Oracle of truth, The Annointed with Unction above his fellowes, The Corner-ſtone, The Celeſtiall Majeſty.</hi> By <hi>Stapleton, The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine might,</hi> and in the Roman gloſſe extant yet from divers hundred of yeares, <hi>Our Lord God the Pope.</hi> You ſee this pinacle, and it is the pinacle of the Temple, for the Scripture ſpeaking of Antichriſt, ſaith, <hi>that he ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2. 3.</note>
               <hi>in the Temple of God,</hi> which is the Church.</p>
            <p>But how ſhall we underſtand the fall of that pinacle of Babel? Thus, Rome by all Expoſitours, as well Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh as others, is the City which is called <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <note place="margin">Ribera, Viega in Apoc. <hi>14. 18.</hi>
               </note>where of it is witneſſed by two Jeſuites, <hi>Ribera</hi> and <hi>Viega</hi> out of the Texts, that before the comming of Chriſt, it muſt, for the Apoſtacy and Idolatry in it, be <hi>conſumed</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rhemiſts Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtam. Annot. in Apoc. 17.</note>
               <hi>with fire,</hi> and by the Rhemiſts, that it ſhall be <hi>the Seate of Antichriſt.</hi> A third we may here terme <hi>a Politique pinacle,</hi> which is a <hi>popular applauſe.</hi> Hereupon was <hi>Herod</hi> ſet, when he drew in as his vitall breath the vulgar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, <hi>The voice of God and not of Man:</hi> and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately became as you know, but a <hi>lowzie God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no queſtion, but the Devil is as buſy now, as ever, to fix ambitiouſneſſe in thoughts and affections with mens conſent, and it is as ſure, that his endeavour is the caſting them down againſt their Wills. Neither wil he want a reaſon for his temptation any more, then he doth here: which is the next generall point.</p>
            <p>Why <hi>caſt himſelf down<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> His Reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For it is written,</hi> God hath given his Angels charge, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore</hi> caſt thy ſelf down.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:54320:4"/>
In this one reaſon we have divers obſervables. Firſt is the Allegation, It is written, <hi>He hath given his Angels charge,</hi> &amp;c. By his deceitfull lying in concealing a neceſſary part thereof. The ſecond, in dealing thus with ſacred Scripture, which maketh the lye utterly Sacrilegious. Two others are diſcerned in the Devils conſequence: one in his pretentions thus: <hi>If thou be the Sonne of God,</hi> &amp;c. to wit, that thereby thou mayeſt manifeſt thy dignity and ſpeciall intereſt thou haſt in the favour of God: The ſecond in his intention, <hi>If thou be the Sonne,</hi> &amp;c. that by trying concluſions he might work his own deſtruction. Let us begin with his lye; It is no newes to heare that the Devil can lye, whom <note place="margin">Pſal. 91. 11. John. 8. 4.</note>Chriſt thus branded, ſaying, that he <hi>is a lyar, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lyes,</hi> as if lying were a property eſſential unto him, who no ſooner heard this queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>Who ſhal deceive Ahab?</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Kings 22. 21.</note>but inſtantly anſwered, as if this were an office peculiar unto himſelf, and ſaid, <hi>I will be a falſe ſpeaker in the mouth of all Ahabs Prophets.</hi> But the manner of this lying is worth inquiring into. The tenour of the Text which he cited runneth thus; <hi>He,</hi> namely God, <hi>Will give his Angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy wayes; they ſhall hold thee up in their hands, that thou daſh not thy foot againſt a ſtone.</hi> But the Devil omitteth that clauſe, <hi>to keep thee in all thy wayes,</hi> whereby is meant the wayes of his own revealed ordinances, as all the Pſalmes ſpeake, which were directory words, and made againſt the Devills temptation of ſeeking extraordinary, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous wayes of mans own will. He did thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend therefore a lying deluſion, as many expoſitours, Ancient and others have obſerved: and the Devil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>the father of lyes,</hi> every one that liveth in the world will acknowledge, that he hath had
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54320:5"/>
an innumerable off-ſpring therein. Now, the manner of lying is twofold, one cloſe, by that equivocation, which is called mentall reſervation, which we may call Jeſuiticall, becauſe of their more ſpecial profeſſion and practiſe thereof, inſtructing every Prieſt, when he is examined by a Magiſtrate, and in danger to be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, that being asked, <hi>Art thou a Prieſt;</hi> he may anſwer ſlily, <hi>I am no Prieſt,</hi> reſerving this notion in his minde, <hi>to tell it unto you:</hi> Which Jeſuiticall art and ſubtilty in the Prieſts anſwer, we diſcerne here to have been Satanicall in this Deviliſh temptation, by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment of the former words of the Pſalmes. As for example thus, <hi>He hath given his Angels charge over thee,</hi> &amp; not uttering the next words, <hi>In all thy wayes,</hi> could not but reſerve in his minde a purpoſe of not telling it unto Chriſt. For it is impoſſible, but that he, who omitteth words, leſt they ſhould be told hath the ſame co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ception in his mind. But they tell it and print it in their books, that this kind of anſwer by reſervation is no lye. Let us therefore try this out of Gods book. <hi>Ananias</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſold his poſſeſſion for a piece of money, and laid it down at the Apoſtles feet to be diſtributed in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, craftily kept back a part thereof: to whom Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, <hi>Why hath Sathan poſſeſſed thy heart to lye to the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> Now, lying is not without ſome expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of words, which muſt have been to this queſtion. Thou <hi>Ananias,</hi> haſt thou ſold them that poſſeſſion but for ſo much? and he anſwering, <hi>but for ſo much,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing a part, could not but conceive in his mind a ſelling it but for ſo much for ought that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould know; which as we have heard from <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe, came from the Devil, and therefore was as I ſaid, a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanicall lye. And I leave it, that I may come to that,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54320:5"/>
which is open, direct and flat lying, which is commonly practiſed amongſt men, and may be called, as <hi>Bernard</hi> termeth every brazen faced ſinne, <hi>Daemon meridianus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We reade of diſtinct and peculiar Nationall ſinnes, as being more predominant in ſome countryes then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; ſome branded with the infamy of Drunkenneſſe, ſome of Gluttonie, ſome of Venery, and the like, ſome have become Proverbialls for lying: whence we have the <hi>Graeca fides,</hi> the faith (meaning faithleſneſſe) of the Grecians: <hi>Punica fides,</hi> the faith of the Punicks, and <hi>fides Cretenſium,</hi> the Cretians faith: to which we may adde (if we conſider our proficiency in forging lyes in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of three yeares) I ſpeake to our ſhame) our <hi>fides Anglicana,</hi> whether <hi>Privata</hi> or <hi>Publica,</hi> exceeding the three former put them all together, when as ſtill our to morrow doth give yeſterday the lye. So epidemical is this leproſie amongſt us. I returne to the Text, <hi>It is written.</hi> So then, this we ſpeak of is uſed by the devil, in his falſe allegation of the ſaid Scripture, aggravating the lye to make it ſacrilegious. The devil, ſaith the Apoſtle, can tranſlate himſelfe into an Angel of light; this he doth moſt, whenſoever under the colour of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, and of newly deviſed ſtrictneſſe of manners and opinions, he ſeduceth men into new hereſies and ſchiſmes, as is taught us <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 23. But yet can there be any transformation more deluſive and ſacrilegious then this, the perverting of the right ſenſe of Scripture, whether by falſe gloſſes, or (and that eſpecially) by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing the ſenſe of Scriptures by omiſſion of words and circumſtances, which contradict the intention of the Objectours? upon which point come wee now more eſpecially to inſiſt.</p>
            <p>Many houres would not ſuffice to rehearſe the many
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54320:6"/>
Romiſh ſophiſtries in this kind of abuſing of Scriptures in every controverſie; but I have ſingled out one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moſt pertinent for the preſent time, which is, their doctrine of Subjects taking up Armes againſt Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty for reſtoring of Religion, and calling it a juſt cauſe, for juſtifying of their former Iriſh and now En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Popiſh Rebellions, which may give you a cleare ſcantling how to judge of the reſt.</p>
            <p>Thus beginning with this their Maxime, <hi>That the power of all Government is alwayes reſident in the people,</hi> and therefore for Religions ſake, they may make their Inſurrections at pleaſure. Their firſt Scripture is out of the 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13. where ſpeaking of a King, he ſaith he is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a creature of man, or humane creature, which we ſay is moſt true, <hi>in conſtituendo,</hi> in conſtituting a King, or any forme of Government. But <hi>rege conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuto,</hi> the King being conſtituted and eſtabliſhed, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Government by the ordinance of God is in the Governour, and not in the people; and therefore they wittingly conceale that <hi>Peter</hi> having ſaid of the creation of a King that it is <hi>Humane,</hi> addeth preſently (he being once authorized) an injunction upon the people, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Submit your ſelves unto him.</hi> How? during their owne wills? nay, for he ſubjoyneth, <hi>for the Lords ſake:</hi> So that now he is not mans creature, but Gods, who immediately putteth an obligation upon them of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto him. This is the firſt point, and for proof of this our Expoſition, we have the teſtimony of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> where that which S. <hi>Peter</hi> called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane creation, he entituleth it expreſly <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, the ordinance of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. and therefore char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth every ſoule to be ſubject unto it.</p>
            <p>Next, they object, that the governments ſpoken of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54320:6"/>
by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> are written to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, powers and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: that is, <hi>in abſtracto,</hi> ſay they, as Ariſtocracie, or Democracie, and Monarchie; not Monarchs, or Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocraticks, ſignifying the perſons: concealing that, which is alſo written in the ſame place, the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>The Rulers, ver.</hi> 3. which ſignifieth the perſons; and againe, <hi>He carryeth the ſword, ver.</hi> 4. accordingly <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> moſt expreſly naming <hi>The King:</hi> all which have <note place="margin">1 Pet. cap. 2.</note>been concealed.</p>
            <p>But thirdly, they inſiſt, that the power ſpoken of, as to be obeyed, is to be a <hi>terrour to the evill, and a praiſe to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom 13 3, 4.</note>
               <hi>the good.</hi> And therefore if a King prove tyrannous, they owe no more ſubjection; concealing, that <hi>Paul</hi> notwithſtanding tyrannie it ſelfe enjoyned ſubjection, ſaying, <hi>Be ſubject to the powers that</hi> ARE: and you your ſelves knowing right well that the principall of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers that then were, was <hi>Nero,</hi> a moſt monſtrous ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to his owne heatheniſh ſubjects, and the ſierceſt perſecutor of Chriſtians for their Religion: yea, not ſparing theſe Apoſtles themſelves, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> but hunted them even unto martyrdome: notwithſtanding <hi>Peters</hi> direct doctrine was to the people, <hi>Submit your ſelves;</hi> and <hi>Pauls, be ſubject;</hi> both commanding to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue civill obedience.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Say they, although <hi>Peter</hi> giveth the King the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie, yet there is a power from the people coordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate unto them: but this they ſpeak from themſelves without any <hi>Scriptum eſt,</hi> cunningly concealing that which indeed hath <hi>Scriptum eſt,</hi> which may diſcover their falſe figment: <hi>Peter</hi> requiring ſubjection both to the <hi>King,</hi> as <hi>Supreame,</hi> and alſo to <hi>them that are ſent from him,</hi> as namely, his Officers: the Law of Relation evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing that Supremacie with coordination is as true a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54320:7"/>
ſolaeciſme, as is an head equall with its ſhoulders.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They being left forlorne of defence in the New Teſtament, poſt back to the Old, urging Scriptures ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſtale trick of concealment.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1 Reg. 11.</note> Firſt, alledging for their purpoſe examples which can neither affirme or deny, contrary to that knowne Maxime, <hi>A facto ad jus non valet argumentum,</hi> but they ſtick to that, omitting Gods direct precepts in behalfe of Kings commanding obedience, and forbidding all contempts: although precepts, as all know, be directo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to over-rule all examples.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For their examples, they inſtance in the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <note place="margin">1 Kings 11. 29. Judges 3. 12.</note>of <hi>Athaliah</hi> the Queene, the defection of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and <hi>Ehud</hi> his killing of King <hi>Eglon,</hi> concealing the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances there extant, to wit, that the <hi>Queene depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed was an Uſurptrix againſt the Heire of the Crowne then living:</hi> That <hi>Jeroboam</hi> was a manifeſt rebell againſt <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> although for the ſin of the ſame King expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly permitted by God, and that <hi>Eglon</hi> was an Alien, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannizing over them, whom it was lawfull for an Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elite to kill as an enemie in open warre againſt them. Thus of Papiſticall allegations. But can this make any thing againſt our Zelots and Incediaries of theſe times? Onely thus much, that they in defence of the ſame concluſion of taking up Armes againſt Authority, in caſe of Religion, depend wholly upon the ſame Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitical and Papiſtical principles and practices: except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two or three additionals, with which the latter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light themſelves, it being the ſame art of violation of Texts of Scripture againſt the rules of due loyaltie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by God. The two which I ſhall mention ſhall not be inferiour to the former.</p>
            <p>It was reſolved in an Eccleſiaſtical Aſſembly, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54320:7"/>
               <hi>publiſhed in print</hi> for the juſtification of an hoſtile man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of entrance into this Kingdome without conſent of the King, and affirmed, that if the Engliſh ſhould deny them free paſſage, and victuals for their money, God would be offended with them, as he had been with the King of Edom, and his Countrey, in not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the Iſraelites to paſſe through their coaſts in their journey to the land of Canaan. The matter is ſtoried, <hi>Numb.</hi> 20. It is worth your reading. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we finde, that <hi>Moſes,</hi> and all the Hoſt of Iſrael, came to Kadeſh, which was the borders of Edom, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to journey through that Kingdom; but concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, firſt, that they did not offer to ſet a foot within the borders of Edom, before they had ſent Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to aske leave of the King thereof: ſecondly, concealing that the condition of paſſing, which they tendered, was to goe onely <hi>the high way,</hi> &amp; that through without delay, or negotiating with the people of the Land, ſave onely to have <hi>water for their money;</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine concealing how, when the King of Edom raiſed warre againſt the Campe of Iſrael, and came to face them, <hi>Moſes</hi> and his Hoſt offered not the leaſt reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but, as it is in the Text, <hi>Iſrael turned away from him.</hi> All three circumſtances directly contradictory to the practices that followed.</p>
            <p>In another late Engliſh Treatiſe, we may find ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther allegation of Scripture much boaſted of; which, indeed, if it were ſincere, might, ſo farre, as a Topick place of example could enforce, conclude for juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Rebellion in part. For it is written, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18. 7. in expreſſe termes, <hi>Hezekiah King of Judah rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King of Aſſyria.</hi> This is the Allegation. Now
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54320:8"/>
hearken we to the omiſſion of words in the ſame ſtory of the ſame Chapter, and but the eleventh verſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. <hi>And Hezekiah ſent to the King of Aſſyria, ſaying, I have offended, returne from me, that which thou putteſt on me, I will beare:</hi> meaning for ſatisfaction and reparation. O that theſe gloſſers would follow his example in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting for their rebellion, and that they would recant their wilfull falſifications, which their art of perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 14.</note>the Scriptures, is no better then a kind of that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> condemned by the Apoſtle, which we may terme, Cogging a Die. It will not be ſufficient to detect theſe Incendiaries and Trumpeters for Rebellion, except we further pull off the vizards, wherewith they uſe to maske themſelves by colourable pretences, that ſo the uglineſſe of their naturall viſages may more plainly appeare.</p>
            <p>Their Viſards are of theſe kinds.</p>
            <p>1. Aſperſions of Jealouſie. 2. Name of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. 3. Oſtentation of Zeale. 4. Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of happineſſe upon every one ſlaine in the Cauſe: beſides 5. their plauſible Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of their allegations and other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to the perſon of his Majeſty, and the preſent occaſions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Aſperſions of Jealouſie.]</hi> It is your common pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice to infuſe into the hearts of people an argument of Jealouſly: but why? becauſe forſooth, his Majeſty uſeth the help and Armes of Papiſts, to make him a defender of Popery. But with what face or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head? ſeeing, that you your ſelves, by the ſame argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may be much more concluded Papiſticall, for urging in this cauſe againſt the Kings cauſe altogether
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54320:8"/>
the arguments of Papiſts: The difference will be, that Papiſts yeeld the aſſiſtance onely in the name of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, according as God hath preſcribed: you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the obligation of ſubjection from God, raiſe an Alarm of Warre and hoſtile reſiſtance. We adde, that Popiſh Arguments doe more hurt then their Armes; thoſe faſtning onely upon the body, theſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſoule.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Religion pretended.]</hi> But yet onely pretended, againſt the Article of Chriſtian Religion, both Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and Moderne in our Church, which is Loyaltie and Subjection to our Prince. We ſay, firſt, that as there is no Article of Religion concerning Morality, more ſtrictly, commonly and expreſly taught in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then Loyaltie of Subjection to Princes; ſo was the ſame Article as abſolutely profeſſed and practiced by the whole Church Chriſtian. Their profeſſion wee have in the Apologies which were written in the name of the whole Church of Chriſt, to remove all jealouſies of Princes, and conceit of the leaſt diſloyaltie, which is made moſt manifeſt, and indeed admirable, above all other profeſſed ſubjects in the world, by theſe three conteſtations. Firſt, avouching againſt the Heathen themſelves, ſaying, <hi>Eſt nobis magis Imperator quàm vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis,</hi> That is in true ſenſe, <hi>We Chriſtians profeſſe more the Right Imperiall, then you doe.</hi> Another giveth the reaſon, <hi>Quia vos conſcios tantum metuit is, nos conſcientiam:</hi> In ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect thus: The Loyaltie of your hearts, O you Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, is but onely that, which you would be loth any man ſhould know beſides your ſelves, becauſe but hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and ſo farre onely as your temporall occaſions ſhall enforce; but we Chriſtians profeſſe ſubjection

            <p>The application of all your arguments from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures concerning reſiſtance by Armes againſt Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, Tyrants, or Enemies to Religion, is by you in this cauſe againſt a King in right and hereditary poſſeſſion, without contradiction legall; againſt a Myrrour of clemency, for deſervings of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, gracious above his Predeceſſours; for Religion eſtabliſhed exemplary beyond compariſon; and vowing himſelf for the preſervation thereof. And now then deliberate with your ſelves, whether your miſparalleling of theſe examples with our King, be not a moſt impious wreſting of Holy Scripture, and injurious detraction from his Majeſty. But here I ſeeme to heare ſome one of you interrupting me with a <hi>non confido:</hi> yea, whereas that his engagement is to the whole Kingdome of Proteſtants without exception, even as he will be accounted a King, and as he expects Gods bleſſing upon himſelf and his poſterity: and yet will ye ſtand upon a <hi>Non confido?</hi> Will you make him a Devil?</p>
            <p>After our thus ending the warrantin <hi>Scriptum eſt,</hi> it is <hi>written,</hi> we are to examine the two conſequences
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54320:13"/>
thereof. Firſt, <hi>If thou be the Sonne of God, then caſt thy ſelfe down, for he hath given his Angels charge &amp;c. If thou be the Sonne of God:</hi> Is this queſtion of the devil deviliſh alſo? Could he be ignorant what Chriſt was? Yes, why not? Devil, though he be an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical ſpirit, yet is he a creature of finite apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and his knowledge but experimentall, and that he had not the abſolute knowledge thereof in this caſe (as the moſt of the Fathers have thought) our obſervation may ſatisfie in terming Chriſt onely <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Son of God, which might agree to any rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate child of God (I have not this note onely from my ſelf) whereas afterwards upon full experience of divine miracles and correſpondent propheſies of him, many devils at once at the ſight of his approach unto them, as he was ready to diſpoſſeſſe them out of a man, all cryed out, ſaying, Thou art <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the Son of God <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as the learned know, by way of excellency and tranſcendency, betokening the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall and naturall ſonne of God. So then, ſuppoſing the Devil ſpake to Chriſt onely upon this intuition of him, as onely man, albeit a ſingular favouret to God above others, and ſo peradventure priviledged to caſt himſelf down and ſave himſelf, and yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure neither. If he tempteth him to make try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all with this intention, his caſting himſelf down upon this temptation, might be his death and deſtruction, and yet with this wily <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and pretence, that this being warranted by the Scripture of God for his protection, it would greatly redound to the honour of God. Of both which, as namely the devils mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious intention and fayned godly pretence, Chriſt
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54320:14"/>
quitteth himſelfe by this one anſwer of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, <hi>Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God:</hi> but to try experiments of extreame dangers by an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary meanes, where an ordinary way of ſtepping down may be had, were contrary to the ſaid Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of walking in my wayes, and conſequently is a tempting of God, being a tranſgreſſion of Gods commandements. Theſe are the two reſults from the anſwer of Chriſt, and may teach us two leſſons uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for our own ſoules ſafety all our lives long.</p>
            <p>The firſt is not to try extreamly hazardous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when ſafe means may be had, as we learne by Chriſt his example in this Text, who afterwards likewiſe gave us the ſame document, when the Jews were about to caſt him down from a ſteep precipice, but he returned back, and went through from among them, ſafe. The like concluſion S. <hi>Paul</hi> taught, when having had a Revelation, that in that otherwiſe ſtorme called <hi>Euroclydon</hi> threatning unavoidable wrack, none in the ſhip ſhould periſh; yet perceiving the Mariners in their incredulity ſeeking to ſhift for themſelves by boat, peremptorily pronounced, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Except theſe abide in the ſhip, you cannot be ſaved,</hi> thereby compelling them to returne to their office, and look to their tacklings. Let us conclude. If that Chriſt notwithſtanding the ſuppoſed decree of God of preſerving him in the downfall, did not adventure to try; and if <hi>Paul,</hi> notwithſtanding the revelation of the general ſafety, did exact of the Mariners to ſtay and performe their offices: Wee may juſtly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge three ſorts of wild and infatuated tempters of God.</p>

Firſt, how many having heard of the doctrine of Gods infallible Predeſtination, chooſing and refuſing from all eternity, according to the pleaſure of his will, have thus (I had almoſt ſaid reaſoned) rambled in their brains? If I be elect, I cannot periſh; if not, I cannot but periſh: Seeing therefore ſaved or not ſaved they muſt needs be, I will therefore live after my hearts luſt in the pleaſures of ſinne. We ſay, that this is a deviliſh temptation, and a <hi>caſting downe the ſoule,</hi> without repentance, into the bottome of hell. Let every one thus tempted but tranſlate his thoughts to the conſideration of his bodily condition, and then will he ſee his owne phrenzie, ſeeing that none is ſo mad, as being upon the top of a high Tower, wil reſolve concerning his body, (and God hath as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely determined concerning body, as ſoule) If I ſhall be preſerved, it will be ſo; if not, it cannot be ſo: I will therefore caſt my ſelfe downe headlong, and not rather take the way downe, whence I came up, knowing otherwiſe, that by this downfall hee maketh himſelfe <hi>Felo de ſe</hi> in Mans Court, and in Gods Judicature guilty of his owne damnation. Our <hi>Theorem</hi> therefore is this, That the directions of mans wayes are not to depend upon the ſecret and unknowne decree of God, but upon his precepts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed unto us in his Word.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſort are the Solifidians and Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in their abuſe of the doctrine of Juſtification by Faith without works: The one, as if together with the Papiſt he reaſoned thus againſt Proteſtants, You ſay, Faith juſtifyeth without works, therefore you teach, that it is void of works: As much as to ſay,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54320:15"/>
Light in the fire doth enlighten men without heat, therefore is light in the fire without all heat; altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contradictory to the direct <hi>Scriptum eſt</hi> of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 6.</note>who deſcribing Juſtification by faith, faith he, <hi>Faith which worketh by love.</hi> So then, a Juſtifying Faith is a loving, and therefore a living faith. 2. Repugnant alſo to S. <hi>James,</hi> who ſpeaking of a faith void of works, confuteth it by the moſt emphaticall way of Interrogation, ſaying, <hi>Can this faith ſave?</hi> Fully as much as to have ſaid, Impoſſible, and therefore is the Solifidian Faith a ſpirituall break-neck.</p>
            <p>The Antinomian taketh off Juſtification by (as he calleth it) ſole cloſely cleaving unto Chriſt thereby; Thus he ſlighteth the works of Sanctification, inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely upon thoſe termes, that Chriſt is <hi>The onely way,</hi> and urging this <hi>onely way</hi> with manifold inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: And ſo indeed he is, if we ſpeak either of an abſolute exemplary way, or elſe of an effectual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious way to everlaſting life. But if we ſpeak of an introductory way preſcribed by Chriſt, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we cannot come to Chriſt and to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then we are to be directed to this <hi>Scriptum eſt,</hi> concerning the whole courſe of our predeſtination to <note place="margin">E ph. 2. 10.</note>eternall life, ſaying, <hi>We are his,</hi> that is, <hi>Gods workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip created to good works, which he hath ordained wee ſhould walke in.</hi> Doe you mark? <hi>Good works ordained to walk in.</hi> Plainly ſhewing, firſt, that good working <hi>is a good walking.</hi> Secondly, <hi>ordained of God,</hi> as the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way, to all that are predeſtinate, to be ſaved; Which giveth us this concluſion, that to neglect good works deſtinated to attaine to predeſtinate ends, is another deſperate downfall into certain perdition and deſtruction.</p>

And therefore, ſay we, their not continuing in the Church of Chriſt, is a manifeſt conſequence of a damnable precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The ſecond conſequence remaineth. As the devil tempted to preſumption by inſtigating to danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ends in neglect of ordinary meanes: ſo did he, by a <hi>Scriptum eſt,</hi> tempt thereunto, by pretence of a good and holy end of honouring God thereby, as hath been ſaid, notwithſtanding Chriſt giveth him a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54320:16"/>
ſhamefull repulſe, by this his <hi>Scriptum eſt, Thou ſhalt not tempt,</hi> &amp;c. The full Theorem in this is given by the Apoſtle, not to do evil that good may come thereby, which drawes me to a doctrine, then which, none is more neceſſary for theſe times, when our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences for violent rapines, our <hi>Sic volumus</hi> impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, our thirſting after wounds and bloodſheds, as ingendred, fomented, foſterd and inforced by that which is called a Cauſe, were it never ſo godly: yet ſure we know, that be as much, as can be ſaid, for a good intent of glorifying God by unjuſt meanes, it cannot but be to the diſhonouring of him, whilſt it wanteth Gods own warrant and <hi>Scriptum eſt:</hi> as hath been plainely ſhewn; Onely we cannot conceale that this Theorem doth draw from us another infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as our laſt concluſion.</p>
            <p>The ends of all actions morally, according as the learned know, <hi>are the principall formes,</hi> like the formes of creatures <hi>dant nomen &amp; eſſe,</hi> making them good or il, therefore will it directly follow, that, if ill actions for good ends be condemnable, then good actions for wicked ends much more, and that ſuch actions may be deviliſh, the devils themſelves have ſhewne by their addreſſe to Chriſt, which hath been alledged; where they made that open and joynt confeſſion of our fundamentall Article of Chriſtian faith, ſaying, <hi>Thou art the Sonne of God,</hi> and again, <hi>The Sonne of the Higheſt,</hi> which they did more then once. Now none can deny, but the confeſſion it ſelf ſevered from all evil circumſtances, had been divinely good, but Chriſt never would endure to heare Devils preach, though a truth, concerning the Honour of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54320:16"/>
but he put them to ſilence, knowing, that the Devil, ſpeake he well or ill, he will be the Devill ſtill: he either ſpeaking a <hi>falſum,</hi> a lye, or if truth, yet <hi>ad falſum,</hi> to a falſe and wicked end. Enough of this Doctrine, I come to our citation of three parties, which may appeare, as they ſhall be ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned.</p>
            <p>Firſt are the Phariſaicall Hypocrites boaſting of their faſts, and prayers, and juſt tythings, but to what end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Goſpell tells us, to have applauſe of men, onely their long prayers excepted, which were to devoure Widowes Houſes. Behold their downfall, Woe be unto you! Woe be unto you! Thus doth Chriſt multiply woes upon them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Romiſh Phariſees are the next, who pride them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the merit of their works, merits of condig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity according to the exact juſtice of God: which is an act of Excellence proper to the Sonne of God, and againſt that <hi>Scriptum eſt, Luke</hi> 17. 10. <hi>When you have done all that is commanded, ſay, you are unprofitable ſervants.</hi> And their downefall is elegantly reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt and beſt of that name, and therefore entituled a <hi>Saint,</hi> who as he did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clayme all conceite of merit in himſelfe, ſo did he condemne it in all others. His ſimile is this: <hi>Eleazar the valiant man of warre killed an Elephant that was comming upon him, but ſo, that the beaſt having received his deadly wound, in his downfall light upon Eleazar and cruſhed him to death:</hi> even ſo they, who glory in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering their vices, are therein conquered, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued themſelves, through their opinion of merit.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:54320:17"/>
3. Laſtly, to reflect upon our Engliſh ſelves, if it were that our faſts and prayers were not boaſted of, they might be better thought of. But did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any ſo before us? Yes, in the Prophet <hi>Eſay.</hi> the Jewes did exprobate God: we have faſted, and thou ſeeſt not. But let us ſee what God ſaith thereunto: you faſt to ſtrife and debate: is this a faſt that I have choſen? ſhewing, that God did ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre it. Prayers we have, and that extraordinary long, beyond all examples of all times, in whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever people of God; whether ſome of them fiſh thereby for Widowes houſes, they themſelves know beſt, but queſtionleſſe it is done in a ſingula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, if not as Chriſt ſpake of the Phariſaicall, thinking the rather to be heard of God. As for Almes deeds, I wiſh they were ſo viſible as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a queſtioning the end why? The Acts which are moſt in ſight are contributions againſt Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Ireland, and the Popery thereof: and this we might be perſwaded of, if we ſaw not viſibly the baite of their conditions, for devouring not onely houſes, but all of thoſe Papiſts poſſeſſions and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes within the Nation. Beſides, the like faith here at home devouring in hope the uſe of money by publique faith, or elſe, if that ſhould faile, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents lands. The downfall is infallible, for that, if Goats, which are at Chriſts left hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe unprofitable creatures, are to receive a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible doom, much more Beares, Wolves, Tygers and all Ravenous birds and beaſts of prey, who have yeelded to the temptation of the Devil, muſt be in
