            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OD be mercyfull vnto vs: For the tyme is euen nowe comynge, when as God muſte needes eyther of hys mercy here in Englande, worcke ſuche a wonderfull miracle vnto our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte, as farre paſſeth mans expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion: or els of his righteouſnes take ſuch vengeaunce of this land to thexample of all other landes, as ſhal be to our vtter deſtruccion.</p>
            <p>Ye know, that immediatlie after the preachynge of Noe, came the great ſtud that drouned y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlde. After the warnynge of Loth, came fyre, &amp; brimſtone vpon the Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites and Gomorrians. When Moiſes had declared gods threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynges in Egipt, kinge Pharao and hys people were plaged vpon the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and drouned in the red ſea.</p>
            <p>Such plages came euer where
<pb facs="tcp:8719:3"/>
gods worde truly preached, is not beleued, receaued, and folowed. But at is the preaching of Ionas, the Niniuites repented wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. When the boke of the lawe was reade vnto Ioſias the kynge, he, with all his people ſpedely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentynge, found exceadyng mercy bleſſynge and grace: as lykewyſe all other ſhalbe ſure to find, which heare the word of God and kepe it.</p>
            <p>For when Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had preached the goſpell vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Iewes, thoſe that beleued were delyuered frome the curſe of the law, vnto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the bleſſing of grace out of worldly myſerye, to be inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritours of the heuenly kingdome: and thoſe that did not beleue, were caſt from God, oppreſſed of men, ouercome, ſpoyled, murthered, and deſtroyed of theyr enemies.</p>

            <p>Take heede therfore England, for if thou by vnbelefe, let and ſtop God from workynge of miracles to thy comforte, then ſurely doeſt thou prouoke god to powre down vengeaunce vpon the, to thy vtter diſtruccyon: But if thou doo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde, receiue, and beleue goddes worde, he wyll worke wonderfull miracles to thy conforte, wealthe,

and proſperitie. Yea, let euerye man, of what eſtate or degree ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he be, grope hys owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for if he dooe not there fele that the worde of God dothe take place to moue him to repentaunce and amendment of lyfe, then ſhall he be ſure ſoone to haue experience, that the vengeaunce of god, by a ſhameful ſhorte ende of hys wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched lyfe, wyl brynge hym vnto an euerlaſtinge dampnable deathe. For all thoſe that wyll not creepe vnder the merciful wings of god, as the chikinnes of Chryſt, ſhal be caught and deuoured of puttocks, haukes, and kytes, as a praye for the deuyll. The wynges of god be ſtretched abrode here in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, by the kynges gracious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty, and his honourable counſell, of mighty power, wyth ready wyl, to ſhadowe, defende, and ſaue all thoſe that wyth reuerent loue, come

Wherefore as Chriſt in his owne perſon dyd once lamente and bewayle Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, ſo doeth he nowe many ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes in the perſons of hys prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Preachers, lament &amp; bewayl Englande, ſaying: O Englande, howe ofte wold I haue gathered thy chyldren, as a hen gathereth her chikens vnder her wynges, and thou woldeſt not?

            <p>Now your reuerende maieſty, moſt gracyous kyng, and you ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, wyſe godly counſellers, you are the chiefe ſhepeherds, you are the moſt reuerende fathers in Chryſte, hauynge the wynges of

            <p>God be prayſed, wyth thankeful obedience, and louynge reuerence dewe to your gracious maieſtye &amp; honourable counſell, whiche haue ſurely, wyſely prouyded for, dyly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently kepte, and charitably ſaued thys realme, by driuing awaye the wyly foxe of papiſticall ſuperſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, and by caſtinge oute the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane ſpirit of ignorau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, to gods glorye, your honor, &amp; our comfort.</p>
            <p>But alas moſt gracious King and godly gouernors, for the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mercyes of god, in oure Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Ieſu Chriſt, take good and diligent heed when ye be chaſyng the wyly foxe of papiſticall ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticion,
<pb facs="tcp:8719:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that the gredye wolfe of couetous ambicion, doo not creepe in at your backes: For ſurely he wyl do more harme in a weke, then the foxe did in a yere.</p>

            <p>Then ſhall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you leeſe the rewarde of your former dylygence, and be damned for your later negligence. Then ſhal the welſpring of mercy which of long tyme hath watered this Realm with the grace of god, be cloſed vp, and the bludy flouds of vengeance guſhing out fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wrath &amp; indignacion of God, ouer flow al togither. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil not god by workinge of miracles declare

            <p>But God beyng as mercyfull yet, as euer he was, if you conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newe as faythful, wiſe, and dyly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gente as ye haue bene, to handle the wolfe, as you haue done the foxe, to keepe out the deuyll, as to caſt out the deuyll: then ſhall the people of this la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de feede in quyet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out feare of euyl: then ſhall you continuyng to thende, be ſure of an hunderdfold reward in thys lyfe, and afterwardes euerlaſting lyfe, ioye and glorye. Then ſhall God doo wonderfull myracles in England, to declare howe mercye ſhall triumphe ouer rightouſnes.</p>
            <p>And that we maye all dyſpoſe our ſelues the more conuenientlye for god to worke ſuche a miracle amonge vs, wee haue appoynted for the goſpel of this day, wrytten in the .vi. of Ihon, a wonderfull

For the one, by worldly policy, would haue much honor, and the other of godly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie wil do much good. Chriſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſaid this, to proue and trie Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip, knowyng him ſelf what ſhuld be done.

Yea ſurely, a good King ſhal take farre more delyte in edifiynge wyth conforte and deckynge wyth good order the Congregacion of hys people, the Churche and houſe of God, the heauenly Citye of Ieruſalem, then in buildinge ſuche houſes as ſeeme gaye and gorgeous, and be in deede but vyle earthe, ſtones, tymber and claye.

any of your Counſellers more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal than ſpiritual, more worldlye then godly. Or els tourne awaye your eares from ſuch Philipians, &amp; heare other, as Chriſt did.</p>
            <q>Then ſaide vnto him one of his Diſciples, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Simon Peters bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Ther is a boye here that hath fyue barely loa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes and two fyſhes, but what auaile thoſe amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge ſo manye?</q>
            <p>Note here that this boye was ſhe Apoſtles page, &amp; theſe loues and fiſhes were their vittayles.

            <p>Theſe men cared more for the Commune people, then they dyd for them ſelues, and therfore were very mete to be Counſellers, and neare about a great Kyng.</p>
            <p>Here we perceyue what ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Phylippe, and good Andrewe thinke, but here is nothyng decla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red of couetous Iudas counſell. No, for Chriſt beynge fully pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to doo a good deede doeth neither aſke, nor heare anye coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of couetous Iudas: teachyng all them whych intende any good<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, neuer to aſke nor admit anye

            <p>The Euangelyſt doeth ſhewe howe that Iudas dyd gyue thys counſell, not for that he had anye care of the poore, but bycauſe he was a thefe, and bare the bagges.</p>
            <p>Iudas pretence was wonders godlye, to ſell the oyntmente for a great ſumme of moneye, to relieue the poore wyth, but hys purpoſe was deuelyſhe, to get the mony in

And thoſe in England why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che dyd pretende, that beſides the aboliſhinge of ſuperſticion, wyth the landes of Abbeys, Coliges and Chauntries, the King ſhould be enryched, learnynge mayntay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, pouertye relieued, and the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

no leſſe then Iudas couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe dyd.

            <p>Heare what foloweth: whan theſe fiſhes &amp; loaues were broughte vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to Ieſus, make (ſayeth he) the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſit downe.

            <p>Wel, I wyl tel you that thus whyſper: Euen as Chriſte was <hi>Poſitus in reſurreccionem et ruinam mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum in Iſraell:</hi> Set to reſtore and decaye manye in Iſraell: So be Chriſten rulers in euerye comune wealth, ſet and ordayned of God, to beate doune &amp; kepe vnder theſe ſturdye rebels, whyche be ſo euyll the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, that they cannot thinke that any man doeth intende to do them good, &amp; to rayſe vp, conforte

            <p>Nowe, to applye this miracle vnto this preſent time, the kynges Mageſty may learne at Chryſt to take of his ſeruauntes, Preben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, Benefices, Improperacions and all maner of Offyces, that be not preſently occupyed &amp; executed of a faythful diligent officer, and after thanckes geuen vnto God therfore, to deliuer them vnto his Counſell and Nobilyty to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed amongeſt the people of hys Realme, whych be in ſuch hunger and lacke of faythful officers, and houſe kepers, and godli preachers that they muſt nedes faint, excepte they be ſone prouided for.</p>

            <p>Your Mageſty hath had gyuen &amp; receiued by Act of Parliament,

Colleges, Chauntries, &amp; guyldes for mani good conſideracions, and eſpecially as appeareth in the ſame Act, for erectinge of grammer ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, to the educacion of youthe in vertue &amp; godlynes, to the further augmentynge of the vniuerſities, and better prouiſion for the poore and nedy. But now, many Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſcholes, and muche charytable prouiſion for the poore, be taken, ſold, and made awaye, to the greate ſlaunder of you and youre lawes, to the vtter diſcomfort of the pore, to the greuous offence of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to the mooſte miſerable drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge of youthe in ygnoraunce, and ſoore decaye of the Vniuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>There was in the North coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trye, amongeſt the rude people in knowledge (whyche be moſt readye to ſpend theyr liues and goodes, in ſeruinge the king at the burnyng

            <p>For gods ſake you that be in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorytye, loke vpon it.</p>
            <p>For if ye winke at ſuche matters, God wyl ſcoule vpon you. Thinke not that I do burden you w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> more than that which God by hys ordy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out your willes &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentes, hath charged you wythal.
<pb facs="tcp:8719:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
For by whoſe faute or negllgence ſo euer it was, that thynges afore tyme haue ben vncharytably abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, luerlye it is your charge, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che be nowe in authorytye, to ſe at thys tyme all ſuch thynges as yet remayne out of order, rightuouſly, ſpedely, and charitably redreſſed. And as I do perceyue, that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of theſe thynges afore tyme, hath offended God, troubled the common wealth, and brought ſome men towardes ſhame &amp; confuſion: So do I wyſhe, praye, and truſt, that nowe the redreſſe of the ſame maye be to gods pleaſure, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, &amp; to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> honor &amp; eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of them that be in moſt highe authorytye.</p>
            <p>Heare therefore, and I wyl tel you more: There were in ſome townes .vi. ſome .viii. and ſome a doſyn kyne, gyuen vnto a ſtocke for the relyefe of the poore, and vſed
<pb facs="tcp:8719:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in ſuch wyſe, that the poore cotin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, which could make any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion for fodder, had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> milke for a very ſmall hyre, &amp; then the number of the ſtocke reſerued, al manner of vayles beſydes, bothe the hyre of the mylke, and the pryces of the yong veales, and olde fatte wares, was diſpoſed to the reliefe of the poore, theſe be alſo ſoulde, taken, and made awaye. The Kynge bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the ſlaunder, the poore feleth the lacke, but who hath the profit of ſuche thynges. I canne not tell: but well I wot, and al the worlde ſeeth, that the Acte of Parlimente made by the Kynges Mageſtye, and hys Lordes and Commens of the Parliamente, for the maynte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce of learnynge, and reliefe of the poore, hathe ſerued ſome, as a moſt fit inſtrument to rob learning and to ſpoyl the pore.</p>
            <p>If you that now be in authorytye
<pb facs="tcp:8719:36"/>
do not loke vpon ſuch thynges to redreſſe them, god wyl loke vpon you, to reuenge theym. Here haue I reherſed theim, that the Kynges Mageſtye, wyth you of hys coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell maye learne not onelye by the doctrine &amp; examples of ſcripture, but alſo by experience in hys own land, to ſe and conſider howe hys benefytes, put into the handes of hys nobles and offycers, be diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and vſed amongeſt his inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our people.</p>
            <p>For if landed men &amp; offycers by keping of houſes, &amp; doing of theyr dutyes in theyr countryes, do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowe amonge the people, all that they haue receiued of god, by the kynges gyft, theyr fathers inhery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or other waies: then ſhal god giue ſuch enereſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euery man ſhall haue inough.</p>
            <p>As Salomon, the .xi. of the Prouerbes teſtifieth: <hi>Alii diuidunt</hi>

As ye ſee in day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye experience, thoſe that do theyr owne duties in executinge theyre offyces, and beſtowe theyr owne goodes in kepynge good houſes, baue euer ſuche plentye, that all other men maruayle from whence god ſendeth it. And thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> do no du<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties, nor kepe no houſes, but brybe in theyr offyces, and polle theyr te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, take ſo much and haue ſo li<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tel, that all men wonder how the de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uyl they waſte it.</p>
            <p>Nothynge is more true then the Goſpell: <hi>Date, et dabitur uobis:</hi> Gyue &amp; it ſhal be gyuen vnto you. Gyue plentifully vnto other, and god wil gyue more plentie vnto you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8719:37"/>For God wyll alwayes be afore hand, in giuyng good giftes. For as appeareth in thys goſpell, when the Apoſtles hadde giuen vnto the people ſo muche good meate as they deſyred, then ſaieth the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſte.</p>
            <q>When they wer filled, Ieſus ſayeth to hys dyſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: Gather vp the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken meates that remaine, ſo that nothynge be loſt. They therefore gathered and fylled .xii. baſkets ful wyth the broken meates remaining of that which they had eaten.</q>
            <p>Here they gaue but .v. loues &amp;, two fiſhes, &amp; ther was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> .xii baſkets ful of meates.</p>

            <p>Here alſo maye rych men learne, when and howe to fyll theyr ſtore houſes. Surely, euen as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles dyd fyll theyr baſkettes, when the people haue inoughe, then by gatherynge vp that whiche elles ſhoulde be loſt. So dyd Ioſephe in Egipt, ſuffer no corne to be loſt in the yeares of plentye, but ſtored it vp in barnes, to releue the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple wyth, in the tyme of darth: Not as couetous Carles do here in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland forſtall the markets, and by corne at al tymes, to begyn and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe a dearthe.</p>

            <p>Nowe, to teache Chryſten ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers theyr dutyes, in the example of Chryſtes Apoſtles: marke howe the Apoſtles dyd fyrſt miniſter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people, and than gathered vp for them ſelues, teaching there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all Chryſten miniſters, lande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lordes, offycers, and rulers, fyrſte to miniſter vnto the people, euerye one the dutye of hys owne voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, afore they gather of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, rentes, tythes, or fees by the name and aucthorytye of that vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacion. <hi>Qui non labor at,</hi> ſayeth Paule,
