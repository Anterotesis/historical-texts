         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to which all the Truth, Reality, Order,

is not a contingent, temporary, mutable

<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> so much celebrated by
<hi>Plotinus</hi> and <hi>Philo</hi> in his <hi>Cosmopoea,</hi> the
first intelligible World, the World that
truly is, and the World of Truth, the great
Type and Mould of external Nature, and
the measure of the things that are. The
only eternal, stable and immutable
World, that existed before the Almighty
<hi>Fiat</hi> was issued forth for the Production
of this, and would remain unshaken
if it were reduced to nothing, that was
before the Foundations of the Earth
were laid, nay even before there were
any morning Stars that might sing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
or any Sons of God to shout for
Joy, <hi>Iob</hi> 38. This is the World of
Original and Essential Beauty, where
Order it self, and very Reason and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
dwell, that never had a Chaos,
and knows no black Intervals of Night,
but where 'tis ever Light and Day, and
where Truth shines pure and without a
Cloud. A World simple in its Variety,
and various in its Simplicity, infinite in
its Store and Fulness, and stored with
incorruptible and unsading Treasures,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66457:10"/>
universal in its Presence, and uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
by any Limit of Time or Place.
The genuine Country of Truth, and its
proper native Soil, the Place of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
the living and ever springing Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of Intelligence, and the great Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy
of all Arts and Sciences. Where
those solid Realities, and substantial En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
perpetually flourish and shine,
whereof we have here only the faint Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,
and in Comparison of which
this material World is but a Phantom or
a Shadow. Where all is Youth and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
Life and Joy, Essence and Flower,
where happy Spirits drink of the Wine
that Wisdom its self has mingled, and are
sed with immortal Truth. <hi>Whoso is
Simple, let him turn in hither,</hi> Prov. 9.</p>
            <p>10. But tho' very great and glorious
Things may be spoken of thee, O thou
City of God! yet how little art thou
known, and how much less art thou in
the Thoughts and Minds of Men!
Plunged as they are in a Life of Sense
they are ignorant of thee, Thou first
and only Intelligible, and immers'd as
they are in a Body of Flesh, they seldom
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66457:10"/>
think of thee who art all <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi>
and that tho' thou shinest into their very
Eyes, and they see continually by thy
Light. Thou makest their Day, and
thou thy self art the only thing that is
not seen by it. They take the Shadows
of this Natural World for most real and
solid things, and thy most substantial
Realities they look upon as Shadows and
<hi>Visionary</hi> Chimera's, and all Discourse
about thee, (tho' never so Rational) as
but extravagant and delirous Talking,
or at best but as Notional Romancing,
pure Metaphysical <hi>Reverie,</hi> a Subtilising
upon a fine nothing. They are indeed
united to thee by their Souls, but by
their Bodies to this Sensible World, and
as their Bodies are to them their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Selves, this latter Alliance makes
them insensible of the Former. Thou
art nearer to them than this World is,
nay than their very Bodies are, and yet
they are far distant from thee, meet
Aliens to thee, and so utterly insensible
of thee, that they will hardly believe
that thou <hi>art.</hi> If any mention be made
of thy Name the amazed Vulgar <hi>stare,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:66457:11"/>
and the Learned gravely <hi>smile,</hi> and if
the Discourse be any whit long, they
<hi>sleep.</hi> But if they continue awake, they
sleep however to <hi>thee.</hi> Tho' they were
cast in thy Mould, and form'd upon thy
Model, yet (ungrateful Stupidity) they
seldom or never mind their Original,
nor look up to the <hi>Rock</hi> from whence
they were <hi>hewn.</hi> But had Men but one
clear and distinct View of thy rich in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
Scene, could we but draw the
Curtain of our Mortality so far, as but
once to see thee as thou art, we should
be so transported and ravish'd with thy
Divine Beauty, so enamour'd of thy
glorious System, all shining with the
very Essence of Being, and full of <hi>Grace</hi>
and <hi>Truth,</hi> that we should lose not only
all Value for this Sensible World, but
even <hi>Sense</hi> it self too, and pass along in
the Croud and Throng of Creatures,
without any Notice or Perception of
them, all fix'd and intent upon thy more
ingaging Views, not minding the
Bodies we see, nor feeling those we
touch. We should in a manner be dead
to this sensible World, and alive only
to thee.</p>

II. This great intellectual System is
by some term'd the <hi>Ideal,</hi> by some the
Intelligible, and by some the Archetypal
World, which are but so many relative
Appellations for the same thing, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
it according to so many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
respects it carries to the System of
created Beings, which accordingly is
sometimes call'd the <hi>Natural,</hi> sometimes
the <hi>Sensible,</hi> and sometimes the <hi>Ectypal</hi>
World. It ought to be farther observ'd
here, that when we say the <hi>Intelligible</hi>
World, the meaning is not as if it did
exist only in our Conception, and had
no real Being out of it, after the manner
of an <hi>Ens Rationis,</hi> but 'tis therefore so
call'd, partly because 'tis the first and
only proper <hi>Intelligible,</hi> the sole and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Object of all our intellectual
Views, and that which exactly speaking
is the very thing we always understand
and reason about. And partly because
'tis a Word of a Nature purely spiritual
and intellectual, and such as is not Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
but <hi>Intelligible</hi> only, and partly
again because 'tis a World of a conceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Being and Existence, and such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66457:12"/>
as we cannot but conceive to be,
not subjected indeed to the perusal and
examination of our bodily Senses, but
as certain and as really and truly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to our Understanding, as this Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is to our Sense. But chiefly
is it so call'd because it is the <hi>Idea</hi> of this
Sensible World, as being truly represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
and expressive of it to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.
For the Idea of a thing is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellingibly
that thing, and as the Idea of
a Circle is call'd an intelligible Circle,
or the Idea of a Square an intelligible
Square, because they express these things
to our Thoughts, so in like manner the
Idea of the World, or if you will, those
Ideas which answer to the several Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
whereof it consists, may very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
and fitly be call'd the <hi>Intelligible
World.</hi> Thus far the Theorist.</p>
            <p>Had not this Philosophy come from
so excellent a Person, I should have used
more Freedom in exposing it than I have
done; but as Mr. <hi>Norris</hi> is the Author,
I would not have allow'd my self so
much, did I think it could lessen any
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66457:12"/>
Man's Esteem of his Character and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts.
However to countenance my own
Reflections upon this Subject, I shall
set down the Sentiments of some other
Persons, who are allow'd to be good
Authors in their several Kinds. And
now I assure the Reader, that there is
nothing in the Book so hard to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand

did; and yet after he had read his <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physicks</hi>
forty times over, and had them
all by heart (which I will venture to
say is more than ever any Man will do
again) he was forced to lay him aside
as unintelligible.</p>
                        <p>I must rank <hi>Malebranch</hi> in the same
Order with Mr. <hi>Poiret,</hi> whose <hi>Recher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che</hi>
has furnished out such refin'd and
abstracted <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> as if they were
design'd for Comprehensors; he has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
<hi>Ideas</hi> to their utmost Height, and
because they bore not with them Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
enough, whilst they were barely
Operations of the Mind, or Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
from external Objects, he has
placed them in Subject that cannot
err, to wit, in the Wisdom of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
whom having suppos'd to be the
place of Spirits, as Space is of Bodies,
and that there is an intimate Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
God and the Soul of Man, by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to him, who is always prefen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to our Minds, we are to see all things
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66457:14"/>
in this Ideal or Intelligible
World<note n="a" place="margin">Rech. L. 3. Par 2. Sect. 6.</note>. Now tho' there
can be no doubt, but God can lead us
into all Truth, by displaying himself to
us, and perhaps may deal thus with us
when we are in Heaven, yet this way
seems too supernatural whilst on Earth,
and too clear for weak and frail Men,
who are yet to know by Vision; and is
withal so like the inward Light of a
new Sect of Men, as not to make it
over reputable: To which purpose it is
very remarkable, that <hi>Malebranche</hi>'s
Opinion having been espoused of late,
by an ingenious Person of our own,
with all the Advantages of Beauty of
Style and Perspicuity of Expression, yet
the Men of new Light have taken such
hold of it, as to make it necessary for
him to write an Apology to disengage
himself from the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who would
needs have it thought they had gain'd
a Proselyte<note n="b" place="margin">vid. Cond. of Hum. Life, page 183.</note>: Wherein tho' he has
distinguish'd himself from
these People, yet thus much
he owns, That if the
<hi>Quakers</hi> understood their own Notion,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:66457:15"/>
and knew how to explain it, and into
what Principles to resolve it, it would
not very much differ from his.</p>

            <p>WHEN you have settled your
grand Affair with Mr. Stationer
concerning the Purchase of this Golden
Manual, you are desired to receive a
modest Address from the Author. Some
thing must be said to a Person of your
Character and Office, towards rendring
him <hi>attent and docile,</hi> especially where
the subject Matters are profound and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate,
as well as important; and some
Civilities must needs pass between Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
and Reader, towards introducing a
better acquaintance, before they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to their main Business. It must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
be own'd, that many Readers of
great Candor and Judgment, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with a mighty timerous Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
can never enter upon a Preface, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction,
or <hi>Apparatus</hi> without the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Circumspection, and very great
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:66457:18"/>
Uneasiness, lest in every Line some fly
thing should be lurking to circumvent
their Judgments. Now I am willing to
do all I can towards easing their Minds
of such Jealousies, and therefore assure
those Faint-hearted Gentlemen, upon
the Word of an honest Author, (if an
Author can be honest in these times) that
they may boldly and safely venture thro',
even to the Catastrophe, nay the very
Peroration or final Period of All. The
only thing to be apprehended, is that by
too great Precipitancy, many Graces of
Composition may escape notice; much
Watchfulness and Advertency of thought
being necessary to discern them all, as
you go on, where they are strowed so
thick in your way. For, tho' I have
clothed this Body of Philosophy in the
most proper and pellucid Dress, yet the
Beauties of it are too Fine to be easily
distinguished at first View, as they are
too Dazling to be long contemplated.
There is also a vigorous Spirit pervading
the Whole, and pregnant with Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of a surprizing Nature, being
either wonderfully <hi>Sublime,</hi>
or vastly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:66457:18"/>
               <hi>Profound,</hi> but generally both; which
shews how mighty a <hi>Capacity</hi> is required
to <hi>comprehend</hi> them. However, there
is nothing to trepan any inadvertent
Reader, nor the least Design upon him,
but what is purely and solely for his own
Good. Alas, I am so far from drawing
up a subtle Harangue to bespeak your
good Will, or prepossess you in Favour of
an idle, unorthodox, or injudicious Book,
that I am fully resolved to make this
very Preface almost as valuable as the
Book it self, and perhaps twice as long.
Nay I can witness this for my self, that
I have had much Debate in my own
Thoughts which would serve best for
the Book, and which should stand for
the Preface; whether it agrees with the
Rules of Grammar, or of Heraldry, that
the Book should be accounted the <hi>more
Worthly,</hi> or the <hi>more Honourable,</hi> of the
Two. Due Examination being had, and
all Arguments weigh'd on both sides, I
could not in Equity, but give it for the
Preface; as well because, by the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Consent of Nations, it was always
allow'd the Precedence, as because the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66457:19"/>
Book has no other Office but that of
filling up a Gap in the Middle,<note place="margin">See the Treatise in Praise of the Gout.</note> when it
happens that a few useless Inter-leaves
may be spar'd from the Introduction and
the Index. This shows us what a strange
Absurdity our modern Innovators have
run into, who bring in the Book before
their Chief Preface, or
which is all one, put off
what was promised in the
Title-page, till the Candid Reader be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to grow impatient; for who can
bear to see things so preposterously dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
that all the principal Matters,
which have an undoubted Right to be
admitted in the Preface, should violently
be kept out, and reserv'd to make up a
pitiful Appendage, that is appointed to
come servilely in the Rear of it: as if
the Head should be forced to change
place with the Belly, or the Brains thrust
down to take their Seat in the lower
Region.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of the great Importance of this Theory,
and the Applause it has been receiv'd
with. Of the Author's Loyalty, Honest
Designs and Eminent Poverty.</head>
            <p>EVery sagacious Person must needs
be sensible, how much it imports
the High-lands of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Dominion
of <hi>Wales,</hi> and the Town of <hi>Berwick</hi> upon
<hi>Tweed,</hi> to procure a right understanding
of this noble Subject I have undertaken
to expound. As for my own Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
tho' I have promised to insinuate
nothing that may any way Biass the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's
Judgment, yet this I may fairly say,
that, such as it is, it has been very kindly
entertained in the Places above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned;
neither is any modern Treatise
of Philosophy, except the two incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
Works of Father <hi>Malebranche</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Asgyl,</hi> so much enquired after,
studied and admired in all the Intelligible
World, which is most concerned in it,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66457:20"/>
and best understands its worth. It has
already been translated into all the Ideal
Languages with great and faithful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness,
in each of which it has sold off
near twenty Editions. Nay, such a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Disposition of reserved, private
and modest Liberality appears in some
Noble and Refined Spirits, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
has been surprized with several ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
Presents, tho' he could never
find out any one Donor, by all the flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Designs and cunning Projects that
he could contrive. Some of these Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
were very considerable, being larger
Sums than he had ever been Master of, or
could now have expected. Hereby to his
great Satisfaction, he is grown strangely
enriched in Idea, all of a sudden; and
has happily attained the great Ends of
all his Study, having ever laboured to do
Some publick Service to the World, and
withal to get a Penny for his own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> private
Use. Till now, he never succeeded
to his Wish, nor was Fortune ever so
kind to bestow upon him, either a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
or any thing of that nature, suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to his Deserts, and the Greatness of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:66457:20"/>
his Spirit. Neither did it avail him any
thing to have been a Person of unsha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Virtue and Loyalty, which he must
be acknowledged to have approved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
upon all Occasions. This indeed is
the more <hi>Remarkable</hi> in him, as having
formerly been known a <hi>Furious Iacobite,</hi>
and continuing at present a <hi>Furious</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican,
and a <hi>Furious</hi> Preacher of <hi>Scotch
Moderation,</hi> having some time ago learnt,
and settled in his Heart many a good and
useful Doctrine, among which this is
laid down for a Fundamental, That since
by the unanimous Confession of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
Statesmen and Casuists, Time is
the only thing which brings about all
our good Fortune, and is consequently
our best Friend and Benefactor, we are
manifestly engaged by Gratitude and
Generosity to be true to it, and never
shrink from <hi>serving</hi> it to the best of our
Power, in any the worst Circumstances,
or Revolutions of Condition it can fall
into.</p>

ill Success therein.</head>
            <p>HAving observed that small Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
accrues from praising Men
of Honour and Integrity, or censuring
of Knaves, I formerly resolved upon the
contrary Method of bestowing Satyrs
upon all that are loyal and vertuous, and
Panegyricks upon 'tother sort of good
People. But in both kinds I found some
of my Betters so expert, that I could
not hope to find my accounts, or make
any Figure in either. The first Essay I
made of my Faculty was at <hi>Nando</hi>'s
Coffee-house, where, not considering who
lolled at my Elbow, I ventured to let fly
half a dozen strong Lies against Arch-Bishop
<hi>Laud,</hi> together with a smooth
Sentence in Defence of Trimming; and
what should I find in Print within a
Week, but these very Products of my
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:66457:21"/>
own Impudence; the former display'd
in the Observator with ample Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and the latter set down in Dr.
<hi>Davenant</hi>'s Essay upon the Versatility of
his own Soul, and not without a formal
<hi>Allusion</hi> to <hi>Tacitus.</hi> These are all to be
seen still in my Common-place-Book,
and any Gentleman that pleases may
command the Sight. I resented this
Affair, as very unkind Usage from my
Brother <hi>Touchin,</hi> tho' I would not take so
much notice of Dr. <hi>D—nt</hi>'s little Theft,
because he was then as it were a Stranger,
and but newly come over to our Party.</p>

            <p>MY next Project was to beg a small
Estate of the Muses; in Hopes
of whose Favour, I made them daily Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations
of liquid Jett, and sacrificed to
their Deities, each year, a hundred
Reams of Paper. The Reader will
see that my Oblations have not been
quite in vain, if among all the Poems

with great Diligence, he shall be able to
cull out.</p>

            <p>'TIS possible I may hardly find
Credit among many well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
People, when I declare that this
<hi>Damon</hi> is no other, than my own self,
tho' still alive; but as for <hi>Marcellis, aliàs
Flavelia,</hi> that appears to be so desperately
afflicted for my Death, I must own that
she is utterly unknown to me. However,
I pity the unfortunate Lady, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but she is a very Lovely and very
Worthy Person; for, otherwise, 'tis
highly probable she would not be so
much concern'd. whoever the Lady be,
in composing this Poem, I design'd that
after my Death, which at that time was
hourly expected by my Heirs, it should
pass in her Name, both for her Honour
and my own; as by the Whiningness of
it, you may believe it was indited in a
melancholick Season. But since my
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:66457:34"/>
happy Recovery, I am taken with a
Jealousy, that the said Nymph deals by
me disloyally, entertaining my worthless
Rival, to her own Dishonour, and my
Despair. Therefore I now think it Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to take to my self the Credit of my
own Verses, and make publick my love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Intention of entitling them to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellis,</hi>
that the World may see the Justice
of my Dealings, and what she has lost
by playing me false.</p>
            <p>Together with this Ditty I had devis'd
an Epitaph for my self, that my Memory
might be preserv'd in my own Works;
besides that I was unwilling to have
<hi>Marcellis</hi> turn her self to Stone on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
Now such is the Nature of that kind
of Composition, as necessitated my speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much in my own Commendation,
and making a Catalogue of all my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Endowments. For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
it might be construed a piece of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modesty
to let it come abroad in my Life-time,
and seems therefore more advisable
to reserve it for one of my <hi>postumous</hi> Works.
Among these will be found also very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Memoirs of all, even the very
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:66457:34"/>
minutest of my Concerns; especially
my most material Thoughts, which I
never yet discover'd, and the wise Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
that I chiefly delight in. Of all
which I give this publick Advertisement,
because it will be a mighty Help to the
Learned Person, who is to be the Writer
of my Life, for whom I always enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a very particular Respect, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
bequeath to him the said Journal,
not doubting but he will perform accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>IT was well for these innocent Verses
here present, as likewise for me and
my happy Reader, that Fate provided
for their Security from all the Injuries of
inclement Seasons, the hostile Invasions
of domestick Vermin, and the Rage of
devouring Elements; being partly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonado'd
out upon the Walls of my
Garret, and partly fumigated upon my
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:66457:35"/>
Cieling with a Taper of Sheep's Wax.
The single Elegy that treats of Raisins
and Almonds, happen'd to remain alive
in my <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> having but newly been
engender'd there by a wonderful Irradia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from that masculine Muse with
which Mr. <hi>Wy—ly</hi> is now Possessed. Had
these, or any of these been intrusted to
frail Paper, they had certainly been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
over to secular Flames and eternal
Oblivion; the same Fate that was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone
by some Thousands of their
Fellows, altogether as deserving as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
That fatal Execution has since
cost me a sad Repentance; but it was
done in the heat of Passion, and 'tis a
Happiness these few were preserv'd for
my Comfort. Immediately after the
Massacre was committed, I found means
to enter my self among a Club of Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleteers,
which was truly the best re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
Society that I have known, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
only some four or five of our Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demies.
When a Volume of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Figure was in hand, every Man
had his particular Province assign'd him,

Members that flourished all our Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
a Fourth had a happy Genius for

in this Faculty, as is <hi>Incredible to

said with Modesty of my great Dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
that I am able to set down a copious
Index without ever casting an Eye upon

both for the Preservation and Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of my good Reader's Sences, and
this Treatise of mine is also calculated
to provoke the most passionate Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:66457:39"/>
especially in the greatest and finest
Spirits, which are not only most preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
but soonest endanger'd; in such a
Case as this, I judged it would become
and Author to use the utmost Precaution
for moderating the Surprize that is to
come upon his Reader, and no better
Expedient occurred to me than that of
confessing and laying open the whole
Mystery of my Art, since nothing does
more take off from our Astonishment
than a right Apprehension of the Way a
thing is done. On the other side, in
Opposition to these Considerations, I
plainly saw that many unlucky Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
would attend the Publication of
my Secret, which I may truly call my
<hi>Choice Receit,</hi> or <hi>Elixir Scribendi;</hi> For
First, unless it be taken and apply'd with
utmost Caution, it operates too strongly
on the Stile, and turns every thing into
<hi>Elevate</hi> and <hi>Surprize.</hi> Let a Banker, a
Doctor, or a Scrivener set himself to
dash over a Bill, or Deed of Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
he would have his Ink run insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
into Flights and Metaphors, Quaint
Conceits, Grave Apophthegms, Politick
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:66457:39"/>
Sayings, and Learned Dissertations, such
as the Body of this Treatise consists of;
so that such Gentlemen would receive
little Benefit by my <hi>Elixir;</hi> for a wise
Man would no more wish that every Pen
he handles should flow nothing but Wit,
than that every thing he touches should
instantly commence Gold.</p>

out, and illustrated to my hands; it
might seem Superfluous to attempt any
further Comment, since 'tis evident that
nothing can be plainer than the Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

we shall a little farther expatiate upon the

against understanding, or so much as

such a Section as is judg'd improper to

be allow'd a Place in the Volume; the

            <p>'TIS this that makes me weep, in
the most piteous Manner, at
the Thoughts of being imprison'd in
this Wretched Sublunary World; as
<hi>Alexander,</hi> among <hi>the Ancients,</hi> is said
to have done before me. However, to
make the best of my Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inement to so
vile a Place, I have been long thinking
to retire, together with Sir <hi>W. Raleigh,</hi>
Bp. <hi>Wilkins</hi> and others,
into the most Eligible
Time.<note place="margin">See Sr. <hi>W. Raleigh</hi>'s Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, Bishop <hi>Spart</hi>'s Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations upon <hi>Sorbie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi>'s Voyage, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication before D. <hi>Cave</hi>'s Lives of the Apostles.</note> I knew for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that the Present is
the worst of all Times,
if <hi>Tradition</hi> it self can
pretend to the <hi>least Infallibility.</hi> For,
this Doctrine is not only Attested by as
many living Eye-witnesses, as there are
now in Being Persons of the last Age,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:66457:42"/>
but has been always deliver'd down
from Father to Son, Ancestors to Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
with such satisfactory and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable
Evidence, as to obtain the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Assent of all Ages and Nations.
From hence with great Reason, it may
be deduc'd that the Present Time is not
the Worst just, <hi>Now</hi> only, but was also
the Worst in every Age since the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation;
not that other Times were better,
but each had its Turn of being the Worst
just when it came to be Present; each was
compell'd to undergo the same Ignominy
before it could be dismissed; upon which
Account the Present has never been
known to stay more than one Moment,
just to hear it self railed at and upbraided,
as if it were sensible how Intolerable its
longer Continuance would be to mortal
Man, who as it is does generally Abuse it.
And indeed how should Mankind be like
to endure a real <hi>Nunc Stans,</hi> who are so
angry and displeas'd, whenever it does
but seem to stand still, or even to move
slowly?</p>
            <p>Neither is there any God, or Godling,
above Ground, that shews any manner
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:66457:43"/>
of Regard to the Present, but that of
Contempt or Aversion. Observe the
bashful and demure <hi>Cynthia,</hi> aliàs <hi>Hecate,</hi>
aliàs <hi>Diana, Luna, Trivia,</hi> &amp;c. Goddess
of Changelings, Fanaticks, State-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melions,
Flying-Squadrons, Menders and
Reformers; how she discovers always
the same Discontent and Dislike to the
Present, as we may read in her very
Face. For, is she not always shifting it
off for whatever comes next; running
over the Changes, and playing Tricks
to elude and <hi>deceive</hi> it? sometimes we
have her mounted and riding Post in the
Sky, where she puts on a new Look for
every new Posture of Affairs; then after
a while, grown weary even of constant
Changing, she disappears and gets down
to the Banks of <hi>Eurotas,</hi> where she hunts
away the <hi>Present</hi> Time, till tired also of
her <hi>present</hi> self, she turns from <hi>Diana</hi> to
<hi>Proserpina,</hi> and flies to the infernal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
there to converse with Folk of
past and future Ages.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:66457:43"/>
If <hi>Cynthia</hi>'s Practise be not Authority
sufficient, let us consult <hi>Metis,</hi> another
Goddess that deals in Good <hi>Advice, Due
Deliberation,</hi> and <hi>Considering-Caps;</hi> and she
takes no more Notice of <hi>Time Being</hi> than
<hi>Vacuna</hi> her self, but prohibits all Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Present as worthless and
pernicious; Times Past are indeed of
some Value, as furnishing Matter of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,

let me advise you to believe, <hi>for my sake</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:66457:44"/>
that there is not a single God, among the
twice ten Thousand, that does in the
least regard what we have been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing
of. So far from it, that if the
Condition of their Nature were at their
own Disposal, they would rather chuse
to secure to themselves one single Month
of <hi>Future Life,</hi> than to enjoy their very
<hi>Immortality</hi> it self, if it were only just
<hi>for the Present.</hi> For farther Satisfaction

to be sentenc'd to that Execution, or to
have the Penalty of Life inflicted upon
them. Now does not all Philosophy,
with one Voice, proclaim the Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness
of the fore-said Maxim? for
does it not assure us that <hi>Vtopia</hi> is a finer
Region to dwell in than any other what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever;
not in this Terraqueous Globe
only, but even in either Hemisphere of
that other in the Moon?</p>
               <p>These Reflections may show us how
justly the Religion and Virtue of <hi>Oliver</hi>
C—<hi>l,</hi> the Vertue, Loyalty and Merits

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:66457:50"/>
by Mr. <hi>W—r,</hi> Mr. <hi>S—,</hi> Mr. <hi>A—,
&amp;c.</hi> for what can give to a Man's Virtue,
Loyalty and Poetry, or Merits of any
kind, so eminent an Advantage; what
can make them so Worthy of being
highly celebrated, as that singular and

either Arctick or Ant-arctick, Past or
Future, (which is all one between Space

Estimable, which must be allow'd the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference?
There are a <hi>Species</hi> of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
who setting up for <hi>Moderation,</hi>
endeavour to defend the Equality, and
urge us with the foresaid famous Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
of Time and Place, which obtains,
as they pretend, in this point as well as
any. For, granting that at an equal
Distance from the Torrid Zone on either
side, the Force of the Sun's Malignancy
does equally abate, it seems to them a
plain Consequence, that at an equal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from the <hi>Punctum Tonunicum,</hi>
which way you please, the Virulency of
Praesentialness must in the same measure
be taken off, qualify'd and debilitated.
Now 'tis true indeed, that the Inference
here seems very just and inevitable, but
the Ground of it is fallacious and cannot
be insisted on; for it supposes the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
between Time and Place to extend
farther than it ever did, since we see that
several Countries, tho' at the same Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from the Sun, yet have various
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:66457:52"/>
Degrees both of Heat and Fertility, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion'd
by their peculiar Situations, and
such like <hi>Collateral Arguments;</hi> whereas
in the case of Time, on the same side of
the Present, and at the same Distance,
Days and Years have always the same
Excellence and Worth; because 'tis very
evident, that nothing has any Influence
upon the Happiness of Ages, but their
Distance from the Present only.</p>

               <p>This present Oration, Dissertation, or
Commentary (or whatever Name you
shall please to honour it with) will be
mightily satisfy'd, if it can but give hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Race a convenient Insight into the
Business before us, by pointing at the
chief Topicks, Offensive and Defensive,
which the Parties militant employ against
each other. Therefore
<q>Pergite Pierides—</q>
on the part of the Futurists it is confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
talk'd, that a Minute to come is
worth an Age that is gone; may, they
pretend it to be an avow'd and current
Maxim among Philosophers of all Ages,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:66457:53"/>
That a Week in Prospect is not only more
valuable, but even apparently longer,
than a Twelve-month that is slipt away,
by the exactest measure yet known. Nor
do they scruple to refer us to the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Sence of Mankind, who discover so
great an Opinion of the Future, as to
long for it with Impatience, while they
always acknowledge the Past to be no
better than Vanity; the days that are
coming, at a distance, being Fine and
Delightful, tho' they change to quite
another thing, as soon as they are gone
by, and begin to show us their Reverse.
All this and a great deal more, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to confirm by a great number
of Instances, but chiefly insist upon the
particular Case of a longing Nymph,
who is always very well assured that the
Future will make her Happy, but when
once that future is converted into Past,
perceives her Expectations deluded, and
herself betray'd by it into Misery and
Repentance. A thousand other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that are mustered for the Defence
of this Tenet, I shall reserve for my sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
Volumes; nor will I now dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:66457:53"/>
miss the Subject without this Concession,
which all Parties, Orders and Degrees of
Men seem to conspire in, That the Future
is the only proper Season for mending,
and repenting of, Faults that are Past;
that it is absolutely the most convenient
Opportunity of setting upon any Work
of great Labour and Difficulty; and the
rather, if it be a thing of such Necessity,
or Importance, as should not be enter'd
upon with Precipitation; for 'tis plainly
impossible to undertake Matters of that
Nature, till the Future is come, though
some prejudic'd Persons have a Conceit,
that this Future tantalizes our Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and always flies before us.</p>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:66457:54"/>
runs on the other side, and has
many Reasons to support it. In my

the Argument, by displaying
all that can possibly be said in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of Days elapsed,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>B—y</hi> form'd a modest Design of this Nature, in the Case of <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s Epist. which he promis'd that no Mortal should take to be Genuine, from the time his Dissertation came out, 'till the Confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration.</note>
so that for the time to
come, no Man shall offer
to write, speak, think,
or <hi>opine</hi> any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Dignity and
Precedence of Times
Past.</p>
               <p>I am so well satisfy'd in the Proofs and
Evidence of this Doctrine we are now
defending, as to believe that the contrary
Perswasion where-ever it be found, can
arise from nothing in the World but meer
Ingratitude. For is it not even visible,
that Men shew a mighty Respect for the
Future only, because they have great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations
from it, whereas the Hours
which have left and bequeath'd to them
all the Goods, Possessions and Enjoyments
which they are Masters of, are often
slighted, turned away, and out of mind,
only because they are Past the Condition
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:66457:54"/>
of doing them any further Service. Now
instead of that Disingenuous Principle,
we ought to forget only what Injuries
the Age expir'd has done us; to forgive
all that is past and gone of that Kind;
be easily reconcil'd to its Memory, and
willing to speak well of the deceas'd. This
I esteem to be one of the most eminent
Virtues, yet it has always been flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and triumphant, and so much the
more conspicuously, because by this
Virtue, which by its own Nature is
solitary, and even self-subsisting, we
are convinced that all other Virtues
are either extinct or languishing; upon
which Account there is Reason also to
be the more fond of this. There is in the
World a certain Society whose laudable
Disposition, as to the point before us, must
not be passed over without due Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation;
a Society well known, of a
great Rank and Figure, and bearing a
great Sway in sublunary Affairs, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
produc'd more Persons of Note in
all Kinds, than ever appear'd besides.
My Meaning is doubtless obvious enough
to conceive, for what can any charitable
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:66457:55"/>
Reader think of me in his Conscience, but
that I do most joyfully lay hold upon this
happy Occasion of vindicating our <hi>Specifick
Reputation,</hi> by doing Justice to the noble
Race of Mankind; to whom I am known
to bear a very singular Affection, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Honour to belong to that cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
Species, in the Quality of an
<hi>Vnworthy Individual;</hi> so much at least
I may say, that this Character is allow'd
me by all that love and understand the
<hi>Good of my Country.</hi> For such my Birth
and Breeding, I own an infinite Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Manes of Sir <hi>Samuel Luke,</hi> my
much Honoured Grand-father, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to some others of my illustrious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors,
who were good old Men, true
Zealots for the <hi>Good Old Cause,</hi> &amp;
<q>—nati melioribus annis.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I take the Boldness therefore to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Honour of human Race, as to
this most excellent Virtue of forgetting
what Sufferings Times past brought upon
them, as well as remembring and exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
with the utmost Gratitude, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:66457:55"/>
Blessings they enjoy from the
Goodness of those happy Days, now
departed. Nay, I will venture to go a
Point further, the more firmly to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
my Cause, tho' by seeming to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it; as some Persons of known Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Integrity, are labouring to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine
something or other, 'tis hard to
affirm what, by pretending themselves
its <hi>Protectors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For since the Press, the Pulpit and the Stage
Conspire to censure and expose our Age,
Provok'd too far, we resolutely must
To the one Virtue that we have, be Just.</p>
               <p>I assert therefore, for the Glory of our
own Time, and will maintain it to the
last Drop of my Ink, that it does not fall
short of any other in this good Quality
of preferring all others to its self; that it
does not fail to pay due Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to elder Ages, or to aggravate its
own Degeneracy. I assert farther, for
the Credit of my own Country, that
without flattering our selves, we are not
out-rival'd in this Point by any Nation
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:66457:56"/>
whatever, let our Neighbours think of
themselves as fondly as they please. How
few among us can ruminate upon the

illustrated, without the sweetest Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency,

be the true Account, is more

than I dare offer to determine; or, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

However this be, it is undoubtedly
true, that there are some five or six Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
at least, in the World, who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe
the matter of Fact, and seem to
be of the Sect of <hi>Sceptick</hi> Philosophers.
You will be surpriz'd to hear what Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxical
Notions these strange sort of
People have set up. First, they pretend
that former Times were, one with
another, as bad as the present; and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Times also are like to be so, the
World being never without Reason to
complain of bad Times, if Complaints
were to any Purpose towards making
them better. For if former Ages have
not suffer'd so much of the same Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
which ours is troubled with, they
have had others of their own, which
we are insensible of; and all Vices have
reigned in their Turns, like Diseases or
Fashions, according as mortal Men are
pleas'd to change, and grow weary of
one after another. Hence they would
infer, that for a Man of the present Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
to tumble over worm-eaten
Volumes, and hunt up and down Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology,
in quest of a better Time than

this which keeps him alive, is to imitate
the restlesness of a Bed-rid Patient, who
when displeas'd, or grown out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
with his present Posture of Affairs,
tumbles and takes Pains all in vain, to
settle his crazy Tabernacle in some

Sollicitude of Brain many Days together,

            <p>AT length my Intellectual Part
quite drooping under the Pressure;
began to retire from the sensible World,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:66457:65"/>
and would have resign'd it self into the
dark State of Incogitancy, had not Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Malebranche</hi> appear'd, in the very
Instant, to divert it from that Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
I had never seen him before, but
found an <hi>Innate Idea</hi> to know him by,
without which I could
never have known him
by any Description,<note place="margin">If we had not an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Idea of a Circle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> saith Mr. <hi>Norris,</hi> we could never acquire an Idea of a Circle by seeing material Circles.</note> or
even Sight of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
After a few Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments
(which 'tis
neither decent, nor civil, to omit upon
such Occasions, whether Waking or
Dreaming) he told me it was the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
he had for a Person of my extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Merits, that brought him thither
to intrude upon my Privacy; that he
knew the Grounds of my <hi>present</hi> Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and would instantly remove them,
by taking me into a better World, where
I should be put in Possession of entire
Felicity; where every Man had Riches
and Honour, Wit and Beauty as much
as could enter into his Wishes, or his
very Imaginations. I concluded this
Blessed World could be no other but
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:66457:65"/>
That call'd the <hi>Ideal,</hi> and therefore
growing impatient to be upon the Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
began to look about for my Wings.
They were a very strong and a new
Pair; and such I had Reason to provide
my self with, having long owed, and
design'd, a Visit to an old Acquaintance,
who has been settled some Years at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernicus</hi>
in the Moon; a very rich and
delightful Country as any in those Parts,
but a great way from my Lodgings in
<hi>Barbican.</hi> Now I very well understood
by my <hi>Innate Idea</hi> of the Ideal World,
that the said World must certainly lie in
some of the Lunar <hi>Regions,</hi> or at least,
that we must take the Moon in our way
towards it. Notwithstanding which,
the Father order'd me to leave my
Wings behind, for they would be a
mighty Hindrance to me in Flying, and
he would undertake for my safe and easy
Conveyance without them; only I must
needs give my self up entirely to his
Guidance, and also submit to be hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wink'd;
Nay, if my Desire was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a true Philosopher, by seeing the
Ideal World to the best Advantage, there
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:66457:66"/>
was nothing so proper or expedient as to
put out my Eyes. For this he alledged
Examples, both his own, and of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Philosophers of famous Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory;
moreover assuring me, the only
Reason of imposing this Condition, was
the great Inconvenience that arises from
the Use of our Senses; for, 'tis Sense,
continued he, that is the great Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to Knowledge and Enemy to Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy;
for Alas—we should find our
Eyes infinitely sharper, if it were not for
Light; nay we should see even Ideas
themselves, did not this Outward Light
stand in the way. I greatly fear that it
must remain a Doubt in History, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I was more surprised by the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty
of this Philosophy, or satisfied by
the Clearness of it; 'tis certain that I
was struck with great Admiration, and
likewise receiv'd entire Satisfaction; as
every thing that comes from Father
<hi>Malebranche</hi> is new, and admirable, and
clear, and satisfactory. Upon this, I
immediately banded over my Eyes with
my own Hands, and then deliver'd them
up to my Guide, that he might pull me
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:66457:66"/>
along behind him; treading sometimes
upon his Heels, and sometimes pushing
him forward out of Eagerness.</p>
            <p>Not with more Alacrity did the <hi>Trojan</hi>

<hi>Sphere</hi> of its <hi>Activity,</hi> you may imagine
it was some Surprize to find my self very
Gravely turning round upon my own
<hi>Axis;</hi> which to me was a strange way
of proceeding, and very much against
my Inclination, having never travell'd
in that <hi>manner</hi> before. And this <hi>probably</hi>
might be the Reason that my Brain was
seiz'd with a most violent Sickness; as
if a great Number of Windmills had
been very diligently at work within it;
and I verily perswade my self, that
there is no going over to the <hi>Ideal World</hi>
without being so affected. We were
easily suckt down by the Vortex; as
you may guess that weighty Bodies have
no great Appetite to resist in that Case;
being seldom known so obstinate as to
insist upon nothing, or fly upwards when
they are mov'd to the contrary. My
vertiginous Circumstances of Brain were
not in the least abated by the continued
Rolling of my Person, which grew more
violent as we descended. At last I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scry'd
something that seem'd to be a
Scull, and was making very discernible
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:66457:70"/>
Circumvolutions about its own Center.
My Guide bid me welcome to the <hi>Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
World,</hi> and immediately we were
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it; for this Scull was no other than
the Shell of it, or the <hi>Ideal</hi> Scull. It is
the <hi>Archetype</hi> of all Real Sculls, and a
Promptuary of all <hi>Ideas</hi> whatsoever; from
which, as from a never-failing Spring-Head,
they are constantly drawn forth
into Things; each at its appointed time,
when summon'd by Fate to exert it self,
and put on <hi>Real</hi> Existence. Within the
<hi>Cranium,</hi> tho' for certain there is little
or nothing of Brains, yet <hi>'tis thought,</hi>
there is the <hi>Idea</hi> of Brains, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
as good, and accounted even
far Preferable by the more subtile and
refin'd <hi>Species</hi> of Philosophers. I saw
also the <hi>Ideas</hi> of two Eyes; the Pupil of
the one just discover'd it self peeping
from behind the Lid, like the Sun half-set;
but the other had turn'd its self
quite inward. From this I concluded
that if they had any Sight at all, they
must fee things <hi>Double.</hi> However, they
were evidently more Perfect than <hi>Real.</hi>
Eyes; for the Perfection does not consist
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:66457:71"/>
in <hi>external</hi> Seeing, but in pleasing the
<hi>internal</hi> Sight; now these were endued
with a very shining Je<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>. which may be
esteem'd the true Emblem of <hi>Illuminating
Darkness;</hi> and if they were not clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sighted
themselves, that was compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sated
by a more rare and admirable Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
for both of them were transparent,
and might clearly be <hi>seen through.</hi> My
Guide propos'd to my Choice, whether
I would content my self with a distant
View, or make Application for personal
Admittance. We might take a Prospect
conveniently thro' those Inlets of Sight,
whereas there was no way to enter, but
along the same <hi>Ductus,</hi> by which all
kind of Vapours insinuate into the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netralia</hi>
of human Head. I declin'd the
Proposal of getting in, being come only
upon Likeing, and loth to be initiated at
a Venture; conceiving also that for the
present, it would be satisfaction enough
to make my Observations at a distance.
Thereupon we fix'd each at his Pos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

were we rowl'd about by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

in a very good Humour, and willing to
over-look a small Disproportion in point
of Magnitude) you may conceive us to
have resembled either two Spots in a
Planet, or a brace of Flies, should they
chuse to plant themselves, for the Benefit
of a warm Fire, upon some convenient

to the good Father for his Guidance,

We carry forth our View into the Regions of

Wisdom has built her magnificent and stately

Even Error in the Ideal World, is

how plainly it must needs be seen it self.

(which is as much as to say, <hi>Student in

a very particular Satisfaction from
the News I am to tell him, concerning
all manner of Figures and Diagrams.
These abound in the <hi>Ideal</hi> World, and
are esteem'd the most excellent in their
several kinds, that can any where be
met with. There are Circles, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
many of them much resembling
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:66457:81"/>
Hoops, which also are reputed the <hi>Causa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
Exemplares,</hi> or primitive Patterns of all
Hoops whatsoever. There are other
Circles to be seen of Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s Square
sort, which 'tis possible a <hi>common Spectator</hi>
might scarce know to be Circles. They
are of great use in <hi>establishing a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,</hi>
and demolishing <hi>immaterial Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances;</hi>
but the Logicians disallow them
as altogether unserviceable to a Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.
For, these Circles, say they, will
afford no Assistance towards drawing up
an Argument into the <hi>Round Figure;</hi>
which is universally acknowledged the
most <hi>compleat</hi> of all Figures, and to be
of soverain use in War, as well as in
Philosophy. The Difference in the two
Disciplines is only this, that Warriours
never <hi>conject</hi> themselves into an orbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Body, but in Cases of Extremity;
whereas Philosophers do not only recur
to this expedient, when they <hi>act</hi> upon
the Defensive, or when they are pressed
by some Necessity of their Affairs; but
frequently surprise the Enemy by it, and
use it not unsuccessfully for a <hi>Feint,</hi> in
making their Attacks. Nay, sometimes
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:66457:82"/>
(so habitual is this most excellent Practice
become to them) they run into it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

Pencils and Compasses drawn, the one
to mark Whence and Whether a Line of

Quodvis Cypher,</hi> not allowing them to

decreed him, of which I shall but name
one. This victorious Person was wheel'd
round a publick School with much Pomp,
in a kind of Vehicle contriv'd for that
Purpose, and not unlike to a modern
Barrow. During the Procession he kept
his Face fronting directly towards the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:66457:92"/>
Spectators; which being all over planted
thick with <hi>Plumage</hi> of <hi>Subfuse</hi> Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
not without the Ornament of a
proportionable Beak affixt in its proper
Place, did much resemble the graceful
Countenance of an <hi>Athenian,</hi> or <hi>Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
Bird, so call'd from being Favourite
to <hi>Minerva.</hi> The Eyes only were suffer'd
to show themselves, and these appear'd
very Glaring and Illustrious, by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of two Magnifying-Glasses,
which were Concave, like the Chrystal
of a modern Watch, of Blazing Dark-Lanthorn.
Many other Ceremonies and
Triumphal Decorations being laid out
upon the Sucessful, lest too great an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flation
of Mind should ensue, there was
appointed an Officer to follow at a cer-Distance,
supplying him with frequent
Sprinklings of Dust and Cinders, and at
the same time loudly calling upon him,
<hi>Not to forget that he was still but a Mortal.</hi>
This Custom was afterwards reviv'd by
the <hi>Romans,</hi> upon wise Considerations,
and us'd for many Ages on warlike Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
among that noble People.</p>

in the foresaid manner, some five

thereby so great a Reputation, for a
shrewd Person at this way of disputing by
Cyphers, that <hi>Alexander the Great</hi> chose
him for his own Master. It must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd,
that the Exercise we are
speaking of, seems to have been in
Vogue chiefly among the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> 'till it
was taken up by <hi>Plato,</hi> some Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
for the Practice of his own Scholars;
which is thought to be the only Reason
why <hi>Diogenes</hi> so fiercely inveigh'd against
it, as an Artifice design'd purely to serve
the ends of Popularity and Vain-Glory.
I think it has never been deny'd, that

               <p>YOU are to know, that this Sir <hi>Sata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides
Goatham,</hi> is a certain Man in
Office, who by several great Attempts
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:66457:96"/>
has made himself very considerable, and
purchased an invaluable Reputation,
Honour and Esteem, among all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and Gentry that live within the
Sound of his Name. The Particulars
are, a harmless Rape upon a Young
Lady of extraordinary Virtue, as well
as Wit and Beauty; a civil Design to
murther one of her Relations; together
with sincere Endeavours to ruine and
defame her whole Family: in all which
laudable Undertakings, by the Spite of
envious Fortune, he has come off with
Disappointment and Infamy, though
not Shame.</p>

               <p>IF we remember how that great Doctor
<hi>Freneticus, Thomas</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> has
irrefragably demonstrated the State of
Nature to be a perfect State of War;
and if we add to that Conclusion what
has now been discover'd concerning

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:66457:96"/>
that in our degenerate Times, nothing
can approach so near the true State,
whether Natural or Ideal, as Fighting

               <p>From this Consideration is chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived

               <p>I could not but observe, to my great
Amazement and Indignation, how
basely Learned Men have all along been
mis-led in their Notion of a <hi>Centaur;</hi> and
that by taking up with such lame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions

their <hi>Metaphysical</hi> Histories. These Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
have, most certainly, either had
very poor Information themselves, or
been very unfair in suppressing Part of
the Truth. For though in their Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles

                  <hi>Iuno,</hi> they have given us a fair Account

another Point wherein the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Poets have greatly deviated from
the Truth, and brought an ugly Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
upon their own Veracity. For,
with what Reason, or Countenance can
it be pretended, that the entire <hi>Genus</hi> of
<hi>Centaurs</hi> is comprised within the two
<hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Risible</hi> and <hi>Hinnible,</hi> or Man
and Horse? Doubtless they were induced
to this Partiality, either thereby to do
an Honour to their own <hi>Pegasus,</hi> or to
make their court to some Knight-Errant,
or other puissant Person that delighted in
Chivalry. For, had they reported the
Truth, we should have been informed,
that the Generality of <hi>Centaurs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> are of
other Compositions, our Ideal Humanity
being coupled with more irrational
Kinds than <hi>Proteus</hi> could put on seeming
Transformations, or than Human In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals
were really transformed into,
when <hi>Metamorphoses</hi> were in Fashion.
This I can fairly attest, that in my most
accurate Survey of the Ideal World, I
could not descry more Men-Horses, than
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:66457:97"/>
Men-Bulls, Men-Camels, Men-Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants,
Men-Sharks, Men-Cuckows,

that fall off, and prudently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw,
as soon as the Preface is over.
There are a Number of Persons in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
who bearing an unaccountable
Aversion to us learned Authors, esteem
the Entertainment of our Compositions
no less insipid than that of our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations;
or if ever they grow a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to either of them; yet still they
will have it that We affect a ridiculous
Singularity in Both. This, say they,
puts us upon that preposterous Method
of serving up our choicest Dainties in
the first Course; which so palls the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
for any thing less delicate, that few
Guests have Patience to sit out the Bill of
Fare, or accompany the Author till he
orders <hi>Finis</hi> to take away. This is Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
sufficient why I should not be so cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in Cooking that plain, but sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
Meat, which is still to come in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Wherefore in evidence of this, I do
earnestly entreat all my worthy and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposed
Readers, to bear Witness for
me that this Instant, the First of <hi>April,</hi>
Old Style, 1701, but of my own Age 57,
We <hi>Gabriel Iohn, aliàs Timothy,</hi> do issue
out Directions to our trusty and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloved
Amanuensis <hi>Ezekiel Philodash,</hi>
that in order to prevent all future Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
between our Book<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
Preface, as likewise all erroneous
Mistakes of the hasty and ill-advised
Peruser; he, the said <hi>Ezekiel Philodash,</hi>
lawfully begotten Son to <hi>Ananias Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dash</hi>
and <hi>Tabitha</hi> his Concubine, of the

            <p>I Doubt not in the least but some
Thousands of my Readers are e'en
overjoy'd to see that the Preface has some
End at last; having long since been quite
jaded in their Spirits, and vainly flattering
themselves at every Section<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they were
travelling through, that there would be
no more to come. But if any one should
have Strength of Heart to hold out;
if any Individual Person of indefatigable
Industry, innate Courage and undaunted
Resolution, will still press on, being
smitten with sweet Love of Truth, and
filled with glowing Zeal to search, to
comprehend, to digest;

Opticks towards my Ideal Garret
in <hi>New Barbican,</hi> what should appear to
me at the Window, but the Counterpart,
or the beautiful Idea, of my self. It was
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:66457:107"/>
sitting as solitary as a Hermit, but in a
violent Fit of Mirth, and undoubtedly
under the Operation of some pleasant
Conceit, which is a thing very familiar
to me in my <hi>Retirements.</hi> And as 'tis
sung of the former <hi>Narcissus,</hi> that his
<hi>Idea</hi> in the <hi>Water,</hi> as cruel as he found
it, never refused to smile, when it saw
that he smiled in Return; I on the other
side, <hi>Narcissus alter,</hi> could not chuse
but rejoyce to see my Idea so joyful.
But here indeed I fell into a fatal and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable
Oversight—here was I seized
with a rash Curiosity, which has proved
the sad Occasion of so much Regret,
and such grievous Lamentation, to me
and to my poor Reader.

him. My Guide, the Ideal World, and
my own <hi>beloved, and lovely,</hi> Idea were

in the Place Father <hi>Malebranche</hi> and my

               <p>I Am well aware that among Persons
who Canvas matters Nicely, and
are very Circumspect in putting Things
and Things together, it may seem a
Problem, how this Edition should so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly
happen to be the Second.
And because <hi>Wise Philosophers</hi> are back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to believe what they are unable to
comprehend, (as I have frequently
found in my own Disputes with the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians,
Atheists,</hi> and other <hi>Great Wits)</hi>
they will probably imagine, that either
the Bookseller, or the Printer, has made
some Mistake in the Title-Page as to the
Number of Editions; Nay, 'tis not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
but some unlucky Surmise may
fall upon the Author himself, as if he
had designed to impose upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
of Title-Page-Learning, upon
whose good Opinion he has so great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance.
And this would ruine his
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:66457:116"/>
Credit for a Philosopher, by bringing
into Question the Truth of his Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and those very Positions that are
<hi>the Hinges upon which his whole Theory
turns.</hi> Now in such a case, 'tis evident
the Theory could be of no Benefit to
the Common-wealth of Philosophy, nor
work its desired Effect upon the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings
and Opinions of Mankind.
It doubtless lies upon me to obviate so
grievous a Calamity as this by all Ways
and Means that my present Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
will bear. Accordingly I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
upon Honour, that had such a Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
happen'd either by the Printer's
Neglect, or <hi>Librarii Incuriâ,</hi> it should

I shall endeavour to Define, as concisely
as may be, that Notion of a Second
Edition which in my own Mind I have
affixed to the said Term. A Second
Edition then is.</p>
               <p>Qualitas quaedam Sensibilis, Occulta,
Instrumentalis, Bipes, Subjecti sui per
<hi>Hysteron-Proteron,</hi> quodammodo Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiva,
quae Subjecto ejus Qualitatis capaci,
ita super veniens, &amp; inhaerens, ut sit veluti
Praemissarum Altera, facit ut cui ejus rei,
quae hujusmodi subjectum est, naturalis &amp;
antecedens inerat Appetentia, in eo genere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
<hi>Duplum</hi> hujus Appetentiae versus idem
Objectum, &amp; cui nulla fuerat hujus objecti
antecedens Appetentia in illo generetur ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua,
it a ut plerumque consequatur Rei cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jusdam
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:66457:117"/>
contentae ex continente desumptio,
quo fiat ut Objectum illud praedictum in ean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem
rem aptam natam aliquid continere,
demitti possit naturali lege motus praeter &amp;
propter Fugam vacui.</p>
               <p>This Definition being laid down,
there will remain little Difficulty in the
Sequel of our Argument; for tho' some
Editions never disown themselves for
the First, as if they were fond of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeniture;
yet 'tis evident from the
Terms <hi>Duplum</hi> and <hi>Appetentiae,</hi> that for
a Book to make its first Appearance in
the <hi>Shape</hi> of a <hi>Second Edition,</hi> is a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
far more <hi>Auspicious.</hi> This will also
save me, or my Publisher the Expence
of a new Title-Page to the same Edition,
which is commonly found a necessary
Expedient for bringing these Affairs to a
good Issue.</p>
               <p>I am not a going to deny that <hi>Messieurs
Gronovius</hi> and <hi>Le Clerk</hi> were very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
to Have this Be rather the Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
Edition than the Second, and so to
have run down by the Nineteenth, &amp;c.
in a direct Line to the First: an Advice
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:66457:117"/>
which notwithstanding all the Reasons
they urged, I resolved to reject. I very
well saw that it was a Proceeding so
much <hi>out of the Way,</hi> and seemingly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant,
as would very ill become a
Treatise of this nature; besides that,
after the repeated Editions should have
exceeded the Compass prescribed, and
exhausted the Lower or Single Numbers,
they must at last either have come to
<hi>Nothing,</hi> or divided Unity it self into
Innumerable Fractions to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckoned
by; as we see that though a
Multitude of streight Lines, all from a
single Point, may be produced in <hi>Infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
yet whenever such Lines are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
into a Point, from any <hi>Indefinite</hi>
Distances, if their Occasions Require
them to go farther, they are obliged to
separate again, and expatiate on the
other side in Proportion to their former
Contraction. And thus, I think, we
have clear'd the Controversy by a plain
Demonstration.</p>

                  <hi>N. B.</hi> The Reader must not take it ill,
if I once again put him in mind of his
<hi>Old Engagements</hi> to Secresy; for though
this Doctrine touching Editions be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
to him <hi>as a Friend,</hi> I would not
have it go any further for twice the
worth of my Copy-money.
