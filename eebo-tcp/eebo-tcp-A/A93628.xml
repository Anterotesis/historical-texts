         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The firſt, conſiſted in their Power, and
in the reſenting of the preſent Diſtractions.
The other, being altogether in your choyce

            <p>We have long agoe, and Divers times
ſpoken unto Your Honours of the one,
and the other: as likewiſe unto the King,
who hath honoured ſo much Our State,
as to have accepted the offers of Our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition.
But We are ſtill with Your
Honours upon the ſame termes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We were
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:112941:3"/>
at the beginning, without any certitude,
or likelyhood to be accepted.</p>
            <p>We have already obtained Our leave
from the King, and have left His Majeſty
full of good will, and diſpoſition for a juſt
and reaſonable Accommodation: Likewiſe
We parted from Him well ſatisfied, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

take Our leave, and returne to Our owne

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our Excellencies came into <hi>England</hi>
to ſhew your ſelves Chriſtians out of
hope to prevent blood and miſchiefe, and
partly to ſhew your ſelves Friends to <hi>England,</hi>
out of hope to prevent the utter ruine of this
your neighbour Nation. To accompliſh theſe
honourable ends you have addreſſed your ſelves
both to His Majeſty and the Parliament: But
whereas his Majeſtie hath accepted the offers
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:112941:4"/>
of your Interpoſition, you ſeeme to complaine
that you have no certitude or likelihood to
be accepted by the Parliament. You doe not
nevertheleſſe declare what that Interpoſition is
which the King admits or the Parliament de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies:
For if the King doe wholly referre His
Cauſe to your umpirage, twere neceſſary that
you plainly make this knowne to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and if the King receives you no further
then as friendly Interceſſors to Intreat or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade,
in this he does no more then the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
does. But you conceive the King of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
enough aſſurance for the Evangelique-Proteſtant
Religion; and (it may be) you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that the Aſſembled States of <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Scotland</hi> having drawne together for their
aſsiſtance the beſt Divines they can from
all Proteſtant Countries, ſhould attribute
more to your judgement herein then to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
Truly this ſeems to us ſomething too
unequall, and we much doubt whether His
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:112941:4"/>
Majeſtie be ſo fully reſolved to reſigne up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
and all his pretences in the point of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
to your finall deciſion. You further ſeeme
confident, That His Majeſty will ſatisfie others
when He is himſelfe ſatisfied concerning His
Prerogative and our Liberty: but this may be
perhaps, becauſe you doe not ſo experimentally
underſtand what is likely to ſatisfie the King,
as the beſt and wiſeſt of His two Proteſtant
Kingdoms doe. The Kings Intentions are
knowne either by his profeſsions or actions; As
for his profeſsions we know they are and ever
were very gracious, but whatſoever Expreſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
He may make to you in your particular, He
cannot promiſe a greater affection to Religion
and Juſtice then the Parliament does. And as
for the Kings actions we would gladly be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
by you, but we cannot apprehend our
ſelves leſſe judicious in them then any ſtrangers
whatſoever. When your State was formerly in
diſtreſſe, our Anceſtours did intercede other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:112941:5"/>
then you doe now, and yet your Provinces
were as divided as ours are now, and your
Cauſe was as liable to diſpute as ours is now;
and what we did tender then was from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
body of our whole Nation; and to be cleere
with you, we doe not looke ſo upon your Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
now. For your good wiſhes to the
proſperity of this Kingdome wee thanke you;
and if you will propoſe a juſt and reaſonable
Accommodation, whatſoever you thinke of us,
you will finde us as full of good will and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to it, as you now beleeve the King is.</p>
