            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

A perfect ſtrength and ability beſtowed on him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all that was required of him, and by that a poſſibility to have lived for ever without ever ſinning.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Walking in that <hi>light,</hi> making uſe of that <hi>ſtrength,</hi> (and therefore upon defailance in thoſe two, upon

               <p>Exact, unſinning, perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, proportioned to the meaſure of that ſtrength; and conſequently upon the commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the firſt ſinne, this crowne was forfeited, <hi>Adam</hi> caſt out of Paradiſe, and condemned to death, and ſo deprived both of eternity and felicity, and from that houre to this, there hath beene no man living <hi>(Chriſt</hi> onely excepted who was God as well as man) juſtifiable by that firſt covenant, <hi>all</hi> having <hi>ſinned, and ſo coming ſhort of the Glory of God</hi> promiſed in that covenant.</p>

               <p>You have now given me a view of the firſt covenant, and I ſhall not give my curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity leave to importune you with more queſtions about it. Onely if you pleaſe, tell me, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition <hi>Adam</hi> and conſequently mankinde were concluded under, upon the defailance, or breach of the condition required in that firſt covenant, for I perceive <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned, and ſo brake that condition.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I have intimated that to you already, and yet ſhall farther enlarge on it. Upon the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> he and all mankinde forfeited that perfect light and perfect ſtrength, and became very defective and weake both in knowledge and ability of performing their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61219:7"/>
duty to their Creatour, and conſequently were made utterly uncapable of ever receiving bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by that firſt covenant. It being juſt with God to withdraw that high degree of ſtrength and grace when he ſaw ſo ill uſe made of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>But why ſhould God inflict that puniſhment upon all mankinde, for (or upon occaſion of) the ſinne of that one man? though he uſed his talent ſo very ill, others of his poſterity might have uſed it better, and why ſhould they all be ſo prejudged, upon one mans miſcarriage?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Many reaſons may be rendred for this act of Gods, and if they could not, yet ought not his wiſedome to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign'd at our tribunall, or judged by us. Now this is an act of his wiſedom, more then of diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butive juſtice, it <hi>being free for him to do what he will with his owne,</hi> and ſuch is his Grace and his Crowne. But the moſt full ſatisfactory reaſon may be this, becauſe God intending to take the forfeiture of that firſt Covenant, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended withall to make a <hi>ſecond Covenant,</hi> which ſhould tend as much or more to the maine end, the eternall felicity of mankinde, as, or then the firſt could have done.

a cleare one to the purpoſe, and I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to object againſt it; only pardon my curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty if having beene told by you that this ſecond Covenant was repeated to <hi>Abraham Gen.</hi> 22. 16. and finding it here called the oath ſworne to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, and yet by reading of that oath in <hi>Gen.</hi> not finding any ſuch forme of words there expreſt, I beſeech you to ſatisfy this ſcruple of mine, and reconcile thoſe two places which both you and the margents of our Bibles acknowledge to be paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell the one to the other, but the ſound of the words doth not ſo readily conſent to.

celebrate the incarnation of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two parts are ſpecified and interpreted by him; the victory over (or <hi>poſſeſſing the gates of) the enemies</hi> there, is here called <hi>deliverance without feare from the hands of our enemies;</hi> and the <hi>bleſſing</hi> there, is explained here to be <hi>giving</hi> us power <hi>to ſerve him in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe before him all our dayes,</hi> the grace of God for the amending of our lives; according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 14. where the <hi>receiving the promiſe of the ſpirit</hi> is called the <hi>bleſſing of Abraham,</hi> the power of <hi>Chriſt</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſiſting and enabling us to perſevere, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the moſt ineſtimable <hi>bleſſing</hi> that this life is capable of, to which purpoſe Saint <hi>Peter Act.</hi> 3. 26. ſpeaking of Chriſt <hi>ſent</hi> by <hi>God to bleſſe us,</hi> expreſſeth the thing, wherein that bleſſing conſiſts, to wit <hi>in turning away every one from his iniquities.</hi>

more grace, the <hi>ſecond,</hi> of crowning with glory; but both thoſe conditionall promiſes: the <hi>firſt,</hi> upon condition that we make uſe of thoſe former talents, thoſe weaker degrees of grace given us, which is the intimation of the parable of the noble man <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 13. the ſumme of which is, that <hi>unto every one that hath</hi> (that is, hath made good uſe of the talent of grace intruſted to him) as <hi>Heb. 12. 28. to have grace</hi> ſignifies to make uſe of it to the end to which it is deſigned,) <hi>ſhall be given; and from him that hath not</hi> (made that uſe he ought) <hi>even that he hath ſhall be taken from him.</hi> The <hi>ſecond</hi> upon condition that he be at the day of death or judgement, ſuch a man as <hi>Chriſt</hi> now under this ſecond Covenant requires him to be.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Judaicall</hi> law was not the <hi>firſt Covenant,</hi> but the <hi>law of unſinning perfect obedience</hi> made with <hi>Adam</hi> in innocence. The truth is, the <hi>Judaicall</hi> law did repreſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us the firſt Covenant, but ſo it did the ſecond alſo: the firſt by requiring perfect obedience, and pronouncing a curſe on him that <hi>continued not in all</hi> thoſe many burthenſome ordinances, which the law gave no power to any to performe. The ſecond in the ſacrifices, and many other rites, which ſerved as emblems to ſhew us Chriſt, and in him the ſecond Covenant.</p>

               <p>It hath ſo, many wayes. I will mention a few. Firſt, By preſcribing the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61219:11"/>
condition, it ſets us a worke to the performance of it, and that is living well. Secondly, By ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us how poſſible or falſible that condition is by the Grace and helpe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it firſt obliges us to a <hi>deligent performance</hi> of that duty of <hi>prayer</hi> for that Grace, and then ſtirres us up to <hi>endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> and <hi>induſtry</hi> in doing what we are enabled to doe, that we <hi>receive not the grace of God in vaine.</hi> Thirdly, By ſhewing us the neceſſity, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible neceſſity</hi> of <hi>ſincere</hi> obedience, it ſhuts the doore againſt all temptations to <hi>carnall ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſloth, preſumption, hypocriſy, partiall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or habituall going</hi> on in ſinne. And Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, By ſhewing the true grounds of <hi>hope,</hi> fortifies us againſt <hi>deſperation.</hi> And Laſtly, if we need a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny encouragements in our <hi>Chriſtian</hi> walke, his promiſe to <hi>enable</hi> firſt, and then to <hi>accept,</hi> will moſt abundantly contribute to that purpoſe.</p>

               <p>It is an <hi>Hebrew</hi> word which ſignifies <hi>Saviour</hi> or ſalvation. I ſhall not need to prove it when an Angell hath aſſerted it, <hi>Mat. 1. 21. Thou ſhalt call his name Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſinnes.</hi>

               <p>The place you cite I have conſidered, and finde a very puzling difficulty in it, by giving my ſelfe liberty to read on, to the two next verſes, the words of which are theſe: <hi>All this was done that it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet, ſaying, Behold a Virgin ſhall conceive and beare a Sonne, and they ſhall call his name</hi> Emmanuel. How could his name be called <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Emmanu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> too? or how could the calling his name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> be the fulfilling of that prophecy that foretold that they ſhould <hi>call his name</hi> Emmanuel?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>You are to know that in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue, <hi>words</hi> and <hi>things,</hi> and ſo alſo <hi>calling</hi> and <hi>being, name</hi> and <hi>perſon</hi> are all one; <hi>No word ſhall be impoſſible with God,</hi> is, <hi>nothing ſhall be impoſſible:</hi> and <hi>my houſe ſhall be called the houſe of prayer,</hi> is, my houſe ſhall <hi>be</hi> the houſe of prayer <hi>to all people,</hi> that is, to the Gentiles as well as Jewes; and ſo many <hi>names,</hi> that is, ſo many <hi>men:</hi> and according to that idiom. (retained both in the Prophets of the Old, and Evangeliſts of the New Teſtament) this phraſe <hi>[they ſhall call his name</hi> Emmanuel]
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61219:12"/>
is in ſignification no more then this, <hi>He ſhall be, God with us,</hi> or God incarnate in our fleſh; which incarnation of his, being on purpoſe to ſave his people from their ſinnes, that prophecy which foretold it, was perfectly fulfilled in his birth and circumciſion, at which time he was called <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Which name was but a ſignification of his deſigne in his coming into the world, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to another place; <hi>This day there is borne in the City of</hi> David <hi>a Saviour, which is Chriſt the Lord.</hi>

               <p>By the anſwering of my impertinent ſcruple I have gained thus much, that the whole end of <hi>Chriſts</hi> birth, of all he did and ſuffered for us, was that he might <hi>ſave us.</hi> I pray you then what is meant by <hi>ſaving.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>In 3 things, firſt, In obtaining pardon for ſinne or reconciling us to God; and conſequently to that, in delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring us from the eternall torments which from God as judge, and from Satan as accuſer firſt, and then as executioner, are in ſtrict juſtice, or by
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61219:13"/>
the firſt Covenant due to ſinne. Secondly, In a calling to repentance, by weakning the reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power of ſinne, and the tempting power of Satan, by mortifying the old man, (that is, the ſinfull deſires of the naturall, and ſinfull habits of the carnall man,) by implanting a new principle of holineſſe in the heart. And thirdly, In perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting and accompliſhing all theſe ſo happy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, at the end of this life in heaven.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>How can it be ſaid that Chriſt came thus to <hi>ſave,</hi> to doe all this, when ſo many, ſo long after his coming, are ſo farre from being thus ſaved in all or any of the three ſences?</p>

               <p>That he came to <hi>ſave</hi> is certainly true, whatſoever objections you can have againſt it: and that by <hi>ſaving</hi> theſe 3 things are meant, if you pleaſe I ſhall manifeſt from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scriptures.

For that that prophecy of <hi>Chriſts, Mat.</hi> 24. belongs to this matter, the deſtruction of thoſe preſent crucifiers, and the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> ſtate, and not to the deſtruction of all enemies at his great appearing yet to come, is apparent by the 34 verſe. <hi>This generation ſhall not paſſe till all theſe things be fulfilled.</hi> Where the word <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> ſignifies ſuch a ſpace that they that were then alive, might and ſhould live to ſee it, in that ſence, as the word is uſed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. Where the time or ſpace of 14 mens lives in a line ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding one another, is called 14 <hi>generations,</hi> not that <hi>generation</hi> ſignifies the whole ſpace of a mans life (for that is oft 60, 80, or an 100 yeares) but rather the 3 part of that; for of any mans age, part he lives in his fathers life time, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61219:16"/>
part after his ſonnes birth, and thereupon 'tis wont to be ſaid, that three generations make one <hi>ſaecle</hi> or hundred yeares, as you ſhall find ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily it doth. So that the plaine meaning of that ſpeech of <hi>Chriſts [this generation ſhall not paſſe,</hi> &amp;c] is this, that all this ſhould come to paſſe in their age, or within the life of ſome that were then men, as <hi>Mat. 16. 28. There be ſome ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding here which ſhall not taſt of death till they ſee the ſonne of man coming in his Kingdome.</hi> Which, though ſome by the next Chapter following, are perſwaded to interpret of the <hi>transfigurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> (as if that were <hi>Chriſts coming in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome)</hi> may yet more properly be interpreted of this matter, ſo immediately conſequent to his being <hi>killed by the Jewes,</hi> and <hi>riſing againe, v.</hi> 21. which was the ground of this ſpeech of his) <hi>Chriſts</hi> illuſtrious <hi>coming</hi> to deſtroy thoſe <hi>Jews;</hi> to which alſo that other place belongs, (which will cleare both theſe) <hi>Jo. 21, 22.

               <p>It is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable that <hi>Melchizedek</hi> offered ſacrifice al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, but becauſe the ſacred ſtory mentions nothing

of him, as belonging to his Preiſthood, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his bleſſing of <hi>Abraham,</hi> therefore it is reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the <hi>Melchizedekian</hi> Preiſthood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted onely in bleſſing.

                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> being conſidered in the whole purpoſe of God concerning him, was to undertake both theſe offices of Preiſthood, to be an <hi>Aaronicall</hi> Preiſt firſt, and then for ever after a <hi>Melchizedekian</hi> Preiſt, he was appointed firſt to offer up ſacrifice for the ſinnes of the world, which he performed once for all upon the croſſe, and therein exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the office of an <hi>Aaronicall</hi> Preiſt, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all completed and perfected that whole worke of ſatisfaction for ſinne, to which all the old le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall ſacrifices referred; and that being done, he was to enter upon his other office of <hi>Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dekian</hi> Preiſthood, and exerciſe that continually from that time to the end of the world, and is therefore called a Preiſt for ever after the order
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61219:18"/>
of <hi>Melchizedek.</hi> And this ſecond kind of Preiſt-hood is that which the Scripture of the New Teſtament, eſpecially the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> doth mainly referre to, when it ſpeaks of Chriſt, and is to be conceived to ſpeake of that, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it indefinitely mentions <hi>Chriſts</hi> Preiſt-hood.</p>

It is moſt truly ſaid and reſolved, that <hi>Chriſts</hi> death was a voluntary offering and ſacrifice of himſelfe once for us, and that will ſerve to denominate him an <hi>Aaronicall</hi> Preiſt in his death, or rather to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that his death was the completion of all the rites &amp; ceremonies (ſuch as the ſacrifices) of the <hi>Aaronicall</hi> Preiſthood.

               <p>No nothing at all, but rather demonſtrate that this death of his was neceſſary in a double reſpect, 1, as an act of an <hi>Aaronicall</hi> Prieſt, and a completion of all thoſe legall rites, which vaniſhed at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of this great ſacrifice. 2, that in reſpect of the ſatisfaction wrought by it, it was neceſſary to make him our eternall Preiſt, or to make us capable of the benefits of that Preiſt-hood of his.</p>

But then I beſeech you wherein lies the parallel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Melchizedecks</hi> preiſt-hood, and <hi>Chriſts?</hi> Is it in <hi>offering of bread and wine</hi> which we read of <hi>Melchizedeck,</hi> or in any thing anſwerable to that?</p>

               <p>No, that is the Papiſts phanſy cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by a great miſtake of theirs, they conceive that <hi>Melchizedek offered up Bread and Wine to God:</hi> and that in that reſpect he is called a Preiſt,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61219:20"/>
or that he was <hi>ſacrificing,</hi> or did ſacrifice; but in this there are two miſtakes, for firſt, <hi>Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dek</hi> brought forth this bread and Wine, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it to <hi>Abraham,</hi> did not offer it to God; and therefore <hi>Philo</hi> a <hi>Jew,</hi> well ſeene in that ſtory, ſets it as an act of <hi>hoſpitality</hi> in <hi>Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dek,</hi> contrary to the crabbed <hi>niggardlineſſe</hi> of <hi>Amelek, he would not allow water, but</hi> Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedek <hi>brought forth bread and wine.</hi> Secondly, this he did as a King, and ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a King may perhaps be ſaid to entertaine and feed us in the Sacrament with bread &amp; wine, &amp; the ſpiritu, all food annexed to, or repreſented by it, the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of grace and pardon being a donative of his Kingly Office: but the Preiſtly acts of <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedek</hi> are thoſe that follow.

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>This is it, that from hence we learne, how farre forth we may expect juſtification and ſalvation from the ſufferings of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> no farther it appeares, than we are wrought on by his renewing and ſanctifying and aſſiſting grace, this being the very end of his gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving himſelfe for us, not that abſolutely or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently we might be acquitted and ſaved, but that he <hi>might redeeme us from all iniquity,</hi> from the reigning power, aſwell as guilt, and that imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, of <hi>all iniquity,</hi> and <hi>purify unto himſelfe a peculiar people zealous of good workes, Tit.</hi> 2. 14. without which acquiſition of purity, and zeale of good workes in us as in a peculiar people, <hi>Chriſt</hi> failes of his aime and deſigne in dying for us, he is deprived of that reward of his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, which is mentioned, <hi>Iſ. 53. 10.

                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:61219:22"/>
And if he faile of his hope, much more ſhall we of ours, after all that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath done and ſuffered, the impenitent unreformed fiduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary ſhall <hi>periſh.</hi> And what can you imagine more obligatory to good life, then this?</p>

And now if you will have my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, I conceive it cleare that <hi>Chriſts active obedience</hi> is not imputed unto any other perſon. For <hi>firſt,</hi> if his <hi>active</hi> righteouſneſſe were impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to me, then by that I ſhould be reckoned of and accepted by God, as if I had fulfilled the whole law, and never ſinned, and then I ſhould have no need that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould ſuffer for my

ſinnes, and ſo this would exclude all poſſibility of having <hi>Chriſts</hi> paſſive obedience imputed to me. For what imaginable reaſon could be given, why I ſhould ſuffer for ſinne, or any other ſurety for mee, if by ſome former act I am accounted to have performed perfect unſinning obedience, at leaſt have the benefit of that obedience perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by that ſurety of mine, and accepted for me? <hi>Secondly,</hi> the truth is cleare that <hi>Chriſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive obedience</hi> was required in his perſon, as a neceſſary qualification to make it poſſible for him to ſuffer or ſatisfy for us, for had he not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed <hi>active</hi> obedience, that is, had <hi>any guile</hi> beene <hi>found in his mouth,</hi> or heart, had he ever ſinned, he muſt have ſuffered for himſelfe, and could no more have made ſatisfaction for us, then one of us ſinners can now doe for another.

               <p>It is there the aſſenting to, or beleeving the whole word of God, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the Goſpell, and in that the commands and threates, and promiſes of that word: eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the promiſes.

               <p>That which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> referres to <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. his beleeving the promiſe of God made unto him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>It conſiſted of two parts. Firſt, that God would ſheild and defend, or take him into his protection, and withall reward him abundantly for all the ſervice that he ſhould ever performe unto him. This promiſe is ſet down, <hi>v.</hi> 1. in theſe words, <hi>feare not</hi> Abraham, <hi>I am thy ſheild and exceeding great reward.</hi> The ſumme of which is, that God will protect all thoſe that depend and truſt on him, and reward all his faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in a manner and meaſure inexpreſſibly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant, and particularly that he would then deale ſo with <hi>Abraham,</hi> a true faithfull ſervant of his, and conſequently that he ſhould not fear.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61219:26"/>
This promiſe it is not ſaid in the text expreſſely that <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeved; but yet it is ſo farre im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied that there is no doubt of it, for <hi>Abrahams</hi> queſtion, <hi>v. 2. [What wilt thou give me, ſeeing I goe childleſſe?]</hi> is in effect a bowing and yeilding conſent to the truth of this promiſe, and firmely depending upon it: and thereupon proceeding to a ſpeciall particular, wherein he deſired that favour of God to be made good to him, the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him a child for his reward, whereas other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe (having none, and ſo his ſervant being his onely heire apparent) all the wealth in the world would not be valuable to him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon as a reward of that his former faith, on the former promiſe God proceeds to make him that ſecond more particular promiſe, which I called the ſecond part of it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>The promiſe that he ſhould have an heire of his own body, from whom ſhould come a poſterity as numerous, or rather innumerable, as the ſtars of heaven, (and among them at length the <hi>Meſſias</hi> in whom all the people of the world ſhould be bleſſed) for that is the meaning of <hi>[ſo ſhall thy ſeed be,</hi> v. 5. and of the ſame words delivered by way of <hi>Ellipſis, Rom. 4. 18. Who beleived that he ſhould be the father of many nations, accordingly as had beene ſaid to him by God.] So</hi> (i. e. <hi>as the ſtarres of heaven) ſhall thy ſeed be.</hi> This ſecond part of the promiſe being a particular conteined
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61219:26"/>
before under the generall of rewarding him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, but not till now explicitely revealed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that God would then reward him by giving him a ſon, and a numerous poſterity, and the <hi>Meſſias</hi> to come from him, was a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular triall whether his former beleife were ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, <hi>i. e.</hi> whether he would truſt and depend on God or no, there being little reaſon for him to expect a child then, having remained ſo long without one, and ſo ſome difficulty in ſo belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; and then it followes that in this triall he was found faithfull, <hi>he beleeved, v.</hi> 6. (or as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> heightens it, <hi>beſide or beyond hope he belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, Rom. 4. 18.) and God counted it to him for righteouſneſſe, i. e.</hi> tooke this for ſuch an expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his faithfullneſſe and ſincerity and true pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety that he accepted him as a righteous perſon, upon this performance, though no doubt he had many infirmities and ſinnes which he was or had beene guilty of in his life, unreconcileable with perfect righteouſneſſe.</p>

               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>What was the ſecond of thoſe acts of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>That which Saint <hi>Iames</hi> mentions <hi>c.</hi> 2. 21. and Saint <hi>Paul, Heb.</hi> 11. 17. offering up his ſonne <hi>Iſaak</hi> upon the Altar. For God having made triall before of his faith, in one particular, that of beleeving his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; makes now a new triall of it in another, that of obedience to his commands: for when God gives commands aſwell as promiſes, the one
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61219:27"/>
is as perfect a ſeaſon and meanes of triall of faith as the other; and to ſay I have faith, and not thus to evidence it, not to bring forth that fruit of it, when God by expecting it and requiring it puts mee to the triall, is either to manifeſt that I have no faith at all, or elſe not a through faith, but only for cheaper eaſier ſervices, not able to hold out to all trials. Or elſe that this is but a dull live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe habit of faith, without any vitall acts flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from it: which yet are the things that God commandeth, and without yeilding of which in time of triall (or when occaſion is offered) the habit will not be accepted.</p>
               <p>And this I conceive the cleareſt way of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling Saint <hi>Iames</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Abraham <hi>was juſtified by faith,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul, Rom,</hi> 4. and <hi>not by workes, i. e.</hi> by beleeving and depending on God for the performance of his promiſe, and reſigning himſelfe up wholly to him to obey his precepts; or more clearely by that Faith which howſoever it was tried, whether by promiſes of ſtrange incredible things, or commands of very hard duties, (killing his onely ſonne) did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly approve it ſelfe to be a true ſaith, and ſo was accepted by God, without performance of abſolute unſinning obedience, much more with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out performance of the <hi>Moſaicall</hi> law, <hi>(Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> then being uncircumciſed) which two things, one or both, are generally by Saint <hi>Paul</hi>

the contrary, and practice what Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands againſt all the invitations of pleaſure or profit, or vaine glory to the contrary; to which purpoſe it is, that Chriſt ſaith, that they <hi>cannot beleive, which receive the praiſe of men:</hi> by that one carnall motive, as an example or inſtance of the reſt, illuſtrating this truth, that he that the World, or Fleſh, or Devill, can carry away from the profeſſion of, and obedience to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is no ſonne of the faithfull <hi>Abraham,</hi> no beleiving Diſciple of his.

as faſt as occaſions were offered, which God, that ſaw no maime in him, did accept of even before he had made thoſe other trials.

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61219:29"/>
all the Commands, yea and Threats of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell; and all theſe are to be received uniformly with a cordiall faith proportioned to each of them, aſſent to all his affirmations, dependance on all his promiſes, reſolution of obedience to all his commands, (even thoſe hardeſt ſayings of his, moſt unacceptable to fleſh and bloud) and feare and awe of his Threats, without any flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering fallacious hope of poſſibility to eſcape them.

may approve and juſtify thy faith and thee, before or without any triall, any performance, (beholding all in the heart which men doe in the actions) yet when thoſe trials are made, and the performance not met with, 'tis then appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent even to men and thy owne ſoule, that thy reſolutions were not before ſincere, <hi>(i. e.</hi> thy faith true) and conſequently God that ſaw that before thoſe trials, cannot be thought to have juſtified that unſincere reſolver, that dead heartleſſe liveleſſe Faith. But when upon ſuch trials God meets with his deſired expected returnes, he then juſtifies the fidelity or Faith of that man, and conſequently that man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, who hath ſhewed himſelfe ſo faithfull; and ſo (by the purport of the New Covenant, through the ſufferings and ſatisfaction of Chriſt) he imputes not to that man the ſinnes of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, nor frailties &amp; infirmities of his preſent life.</p>

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61219:32"/>
coming, I come upon that invitation, then this coming of mine may be called particular appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; as when a picture is ſo deſigned and ſet, as to looke on every one that comes in at the doore, &amp; on none elſe, the way to be particularly lookt on, <hi>i. e.</hi> to apply the eye of the picture par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to me, is to come in at that doore.

The <hi>ſecond</hi> of theſe, if it be reall and ſincere, gives me a <hi>certainty</hi> of the <hi>object,</hi> ſeales the <hi>Promiſe</hi> to me in heaven, which will remaine firme, though <note place="margin">Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecti.</note> I never know of it.

               <p>I am not altogether of your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for I conceive it very poſſible for me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive, and yet not to live accordingly.

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>That to which <hi>juſtification</hi> is promiſed, is certainly the giving up of the whole ſoule intirely unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> accepting his promiſes on his conditions, undertaking Diſcipleſhip upon <hi>Chriſts</hi> termes; But yet 'tis poſſible that ſome one act of <hi>faith</hi> may be more excellent and acceptable in the ſight of God then others; as that humble act of the faithfull <hi>ſervant,</hi> that when he hath done all, acknowledges himſelfe <hi>unprofitable,</hi> and ſo <hi>excludes all glorying,</hi> (which the Apoſtle makes very neceſſary to juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.) expects all good from Gods free mercy in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>without

               <p>It is made up of two things, 1. The thing <hi>promiſed,</hi> 2. The <hi>Cauſe</hi> or Author of it. 1. The thing <hi>promiſed,</hi> or the performance of that promiſe. Such is the Reſurrection of the dead, which nature cannot helpe us to ſee any thing into, but being beleived by faith, becomes the object of Hope. And 'tis obſervable, that ſeven times in the Acts of the Apoſtles, the word <hi>Hope</hi> referres to this one object, the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or future ſtate or life in another world, which indeed is the ſupreme object of the Chriſtians Hope, and all other things but in an inferiour degree, and as they referre to that, and in order to that great treaſure of our rejoycing. Though the truth is, as there be promiſes of this life, as well as of another, (as that God will give us all things neceſſary for us, and the like) So is there a Secular Hope, or an Hope of this life, and an object of that Hope.</p>

God, then that promiſe belongs to us, not elſe. And conſequently then we are to hope it, not elſe; <hi>Ye that feare the Lord, hope in the Lord,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt.</p>

               <p>There is another condition requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in him firſt before that promiſe belongs to him, and conſequently before he is bound to that hope.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>To pray for them, for the <hi>having and finding,</hi> is promiſed to none but to them which <hi>aske</hi> and <hi>ſeeke;</hi> yea and to uſe the meanes ordinary and lawfull, which are in order to that end, as labour, and the like.

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>Well then, muſt the ſervant of God having prayed, and uſed thoſe meanes, hope and be aſſured that that which he thus prayes for, ſhall be granted him?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Yes: either formally, or by way of aequivalence; either that, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is better; or againe either now or when God fees fitter for him: for this muſt be allowed God to be able to chooſe for us better then we can for our ſelves, both for the thing it ſelfe, and the time of conferring it. For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, that which we aske, would, if it ſhould be granted, be worſt for us, and perhaps tend
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61219:37"/>
to our deſtruction; and then God by denying the particular matter of our prayers, doth grant the generall matter of them, which alwaies is that which is beſt for us. Sometimes againe he deferres to grant, that we may reinforce our impreſſion, pray more ardently, and for us to be ſo exerciſed in prayer and hope, is beſt for us alſo.</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, we are, and the want of that is the ſinne of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering or doubting, noted by <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>Well, but you toldme there was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the object of Hope, beſides the thing promiſed, which you called the cauſe or author of it. What is that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>The perſon that is to make good this promiſe to me, which is God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. And therefore we are ſo often exhorted <hi>to hope in the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> For as in the other affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, we are not onely angry at the injury, or the provoking thing done to us, but at him that did it, and we doe not onely feare paine and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, but him alſo that can inflict it on us; ſo we doe not onely hope for Heaven, or for any other good thing, but for God as the fountaine of our bliſſe, and through whoſe mercy it is, that it befals us. This is called <hi>hope in him,</hi> or (as it ſhould rather be rendred) <hi>Hope on him, 1 Joh.</hi> 3. 3. And this is a ſpeciall act of Chriſtian hope, to be thus unbottom'd of our ſelves, and faſtned
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61219:37"/>
upon God with a full relyance, and truſt, and dependance on his mercy.</p>

               <p>I thanke you for this direction. Give mee leave to proceed. What be the ſeaſons and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanities of this Hope?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>1. Time of tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Rom. 5. 4. Tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience Hope, and Hope maketh not aſhamed.</hi> Where the word, <note place="margin">

                  </note> which we render <hi>experience,</hi> ſignifies being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved upon a triall, and the ſence runnes thus. Tribulation is a ſeaſon and a meanes to worke patience, and that patience to produce approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as of one that is tried in the fire, and hath paſt the teſt. And this a meanes to worke an Hope or expectation of reward, and that Hope will keepe from being aſhamed of thoſe ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and make us rather rejoice in them, as in benigne auſpicious ſignes that in another world there is <hi>a reward for the righteous,</hi> becauſe in this life the contrary rather. So <hi>Rom. 12. 12. Rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in Hope,</hi> and <hi>patient in tribulation,</hi> are joi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together. 2. Time of temptation, when ſome preſent delight is ready to invite to ſin, or preſent bitterneſſe to deterre from the waies of God, then the Hope of future joies to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed for that bitterneſſe, and to outvy and preponderate that pleaſure, comes in ſeaſonably. 3.

               <p>You told me the ground of Chriſtian Hope was the promiſes. I pray, is a man to hope for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that for which he hath ſome promiſe in Scripture?</p>

               <p>He may perhaps lawfully hope for ſome things for which there is no promiſe, ſo there be nothing to the contrary; but then this is not the grace of Hope, but a good natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall aſſurance or confidence, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves young men to be full of, and old men not ſo inclined to.

               <p>This is the miſpriſion I deſired to anticipate and foreſtall in you, and now I muſt be faine to cure, ſeeing I could not prevent it. To which purpoſe you muſt againe remember, that Gods promiſes being the grounds of Hope, and thoſe promiſes being but ſeldome abſolute, moſt what conditionate, the Hope, (if it be the Chriſtian Grace of Hope,) muſt be proportioned and attemperate to the promiſe; and if it exceed that temper and proportion, it becomes a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and tympany of Hope. For example, that there ſhall be another ſtate or life after the end of this, both for juſt and unjuſt, there is an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute promiſe, and therefore every man may iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

hope for that, though to the ungodly it be matter rather of feare, then Hope; but for a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py or joyfull Reſurrection to life, a bleſſed future ſtate there is no abſolute unlimited, but conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall limited promiſe, to the true penitent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, and none elſe; for to all others God hath ſworne, they <hi>ſhall not enter into his reſt.</hi> And then he that is ſuch, may no more hope for his part in the Reſurrection of the juſt, then for the moſt impoſſible thing: or if he doe hope, that Hope will ſtand him in no ſteed, will never make that true by hoping it, which was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe falſe; <hi>The Hope of the Hypocrite ſhall periſh,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> and ſo the carnall impenitent, his Hope ſhall periſh alſo; ſure never be able to keepe him from periſhing.</p>

               <p>It is an aſſurance, 1. That though my ſinnes be never ſo great, they may be pardoned me, if the condition to obtaine that pardon be not neglected. 2. To hope chearefully and confidently upon the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe meanes. 3. (which is the prime act and evidence of the Chriſtian Hope) to ſet induſtriouſly and piouſly to the performance of that condition on which the promiſe is made: as Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>Every man that hath this hope purifies,</hi> And 4. upon view of the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of that performance of mine, to hope com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably and chearefully for Gods performance.

In breife, the Hypocrite or unreformed ſinner may have ſome roome for Hope ſuppoſitively if he doe change and repent, the honeſt penitent may hope poſitively. The former may hope as for a future poſſibility, the latter at the preſent as for a certainty. But the latter of theſe, is the onely Chriſtian Hope. For by this you ſhall know a Chriſtian Hope from all other, that he that <hi>hath it purifies himſelfe.</hi> The Hypocrite or carnall man hopes, and is the wickeder for hoping, he feares nothing, and ſo diſcernes not the neceſſity of mending; The beſt way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme ſuch a man, is, to robbe him of his Hope, to bring him to a ſence of his danger, that he may get out of it, to conduct him by the gates of Hell, to a poſſibility of Heaven.

               <p>The want of the Chriſtian Hope is a ſinfull deſpaire,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61219:39"/>
but not the want of all kind of Hope, the think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it impoſſible his ſinnes ſhould be forgiven though he ſhould be never ſo truly penitent, is a ſinne, but that rather of infidelity, then deſpaire, it being the diſ-beleeving an eternall truth of Gods. A conſequent of this indeed may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperation, (as on the contrary, Hope is a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſuperſtructed on faith) to wit, when he that beleeves himſelfe uncapable of Pardon, goes on without any care or thought of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, ſuch an one we vulgarly call a <hi>desperate perſon,</hi> and that ſure is a moſt damning ſinne; but for him that lives an impenitent ſinner, not to hope for mercy as long as he doth ſo, is ſure no ſinne ſuperadded to his impenitence; his impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is a ſinne, but that being ſuppoſed, his not hoping is but duty and juſtice; the contrary would be a greater ſinne and a more deſperate ſigne. So that not every not hoping for Heaven is the ſinne of Deſpaire, but rather the perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory contempt of the condition, which is the ground of Hope. The going on (not onely in terrours and amazement of conſcience, but alſo) boldly, hopingly, confidently, in wilfull habits of ſinne, which therefore is called deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe alſo, and the more bold thus, the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate.</p>

be onely grounded in a falſe judgment of his owne repentance and ſincerity, in conceiting too meanly of himſelfe, in thinking himſelfe no true penitent, when he is; this will not be the ſinne of Deſpaire; no nor infidelity neither: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if he could beleive his penitence ſincere, (the want of which beleife is not the diſ-belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of any part of Gods word, becauſe that ſaith nothing of him particularly) he would aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly hope; and now that onely his humility makes him ſo comfortleſſe, there is certainly no ſinne in that.</p>

               <p>By no meanes. Becauſe God hath made no ſuch promiſe that he ſhall repent, nor without Repentance, that any man ſhall have Heaven. This is a ground-worke of carnall ſecurity, and no degree of the Grace of Hope.</p>

and true acts of Contrition, before or without the habit, may be accepted by God to my ſalvation, yet in this caſe there is no ſure judgment, whether this purpoſe be ſerious, or theſe acts true acts of Contrition.

            <sp>

               <p>It is moſt certaine there is (Faith being taken in that notion, which I told you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to that place) becauſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it, that <hi>Charity is the greateſt of the three, 1 Cor.</hi> 13. 13. And it is as ſure, that no other Scripture hath contradicted this; and although very great things are ſaid of Faith, as of the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condition of Juſtification and Salvation, yet. 1. This is when it is in conjunction with Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>Faith conſummate by love.</hi> And 2. 'Tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that the moſt imperfect things are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies the moſt neceſſary, and conſequently the great neceſſity of Faith is no argument of it's dignity in compariſon of this other Grace. For
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61219:41"/>
indeed Faith is neceſſary ſo, as without which Charity cannot be had, but then this alone is unſufficient to ſave any, if Charity be not added to it. Faith is the foundation, which though it be the moſt neceſſary part of the building, yet is it the loweſt and moſt imperfect: Charity the ſuperſtruction which is never firmely built but when grounded in Faith, and when 'tis ſo, 'tis farre more excellent then it's foundation. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, Charity is a Grace not out-dated in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as Faith and Hope are.</p>

               <p>But may not the outward expreſſions of love in many good Chriſtians be greater to ſome other object, then to God? or is this incompatible with the ſincerity of the love of God?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Our love of God may be ſincere, though it be accompanied with ſome frailties; now the ſenſitive faculty may have a ſenſitive love of ſome ſenſitive objects; which though it be moderated ſo, as not to fall into ſinne either in reſpect of the object, or the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61219:43"/>
yet through the nature of mans ſence may expreſſe it's ſelfe more ſenſitively toward that inferiour object, then toward God himſelfe; and this is a peice of humane frailty, not to bewholly put off in this life. And yet for all this, the love of God may be more deeply radicated in that ſoule; and that will be tried by this, that if one were to be parted with, I would part with any thing, rather then God. But that not to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by what I could anſwer, if I were asked the queſtion; nay nor what I would reſolve at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but in time of temptation and actuall competition betwixt God and that any thing elſe that could not be held without ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, what then I would really doe. This may beſt be underſtood by that other paſſion of ſorrow. I may weepe more for the loſſe of a freind, then for my ſinnes, yet my ſorrow for ſin may be the deeper and more durable ſorrow, though it be not ſo profuſe of theſe ſenſitive expreſſions. So may, and muſt our love of God be moſt firmely rooted, though not ſo paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately expreſt, as through the infirmity of our fleſh, and neereneſſe of other objects to it, our love to them is wont to be.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>If it be a bare ſorrow and compunction, onely reſpecting thoſe preſent terrours, and advancing no high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, then certainly it hath no promiſe of mercy
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61219:46"/>
belonging to it. But if that which begins thus, by Gods mercy allowing of time, and by his Grace uſing theſe terrours for the ſoftening of the heart, improve farther into ſorrow for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing of God, and from thence into a reall ſincere reſolution to amend and forſake ſinne, then theſe ſuperſtructions have a promiſe of mercy belonging to them, though that founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had not. The onely thing then in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be conſidered, is, whether it be thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved or no: and that no man can certainly judge of, neither Confeſſor nor patient himſelfe, but by the fruits of it, after wards in time of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. For 1. the man himſelfe may through ſelfe-love take that for Godly ſorrow and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of amendment, which is onely ſorrow for his owne danger, and willingneſſe to avoid that, and againe, when forraigne temptations are out of the way, and by diſeaſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> inner flames quench't in him, he may reſolve againſt thoſe ſinnes which before he had lived in; or, by way of naturall revenge, he may vow never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to thoſe ſinnes which he hath had ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of, for the emptineſſe and damning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of them, and ſo thinke himſelfe a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate penitent. And 2. the ſenſitive expreſſions being oft as great for the one as the other, nay greater for danger then for ſinne, and from weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of body, then change of minde, the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61219:47"/>
may eaſily miſtake likewiſe; but when God pleaſeth to reſtore health and ſtrength, when thoſe preſent apprehenſions are over, and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the world and fleſh returne againe, and perhaps ſome new that were not before in his rode, then if the ſorrow continue as great, and the reſolution as earneſt, and perſevere to hold out in deſpight of temptations to the contrary, and take not up any new ſinnes in exchange for the old, this is a comfortable evidence, that that ſorrow was <hi>Contrition,</hi> and that reſolution a ſincere reſolution. But if, this time and meanes of triall being allowed, the matter prove other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if the penitent returne to his former jolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and luxury, or inſtead of thoſe nauſeated ſins, make ſome other choiſe of a new path to hell, entertaine covetouſneſſe inſtead of prodigality, ſpirituall pride inſtead of carnall ſecurity, envy, malice, ſedition, faction, in commutation for luſt, and the like; This is a demonſtration that that ſorrow was not <hi>Contrition,</hi> that reſolution no ſincere reſolution, and conſequently that if that man had then died, there would not have beene found any thing in him which God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to accept of. But if the caſe be ſet in a third or middle way, that the patient dye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any ſuch triall hath beene made, either to evidence the ſincerity or unſincerity, then that which remaines for us is, not to judge, but to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61219:47"/>
leave him to Gods inſpection, who can ſee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thoſe waies of triall, and diſcerne what it was in it's ſelfe, <hi>attrition</hi> or <hi>contrition,</hi> ſincere or not ſincere, whether it would have continued (or no,) a through change of minde; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently will accept the will for the deede, if it be a firme and ratified will, and not elſe. And ſo in breife, God may have mercy on him whoſe repentance began never ſo late, if he ſee it was ſincere repentance. But in this caſe there is ſmall matter of comfort to us, becauſe there is no ſuch way of aſſurance that we are ordinarily capable of, nor reaſon to hope that God will afford us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny extraordinary; and for any man to put off his preſent repentance, on contemplation of a poſſibility that his latter repentance may ſerve the turne, is the moſt wretchleſſe preſumption in the world; and that which I am ſure hath no promiſe of mercy annexed to it.</p>

               <p>I ſhall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy my ſelfe with theſe grounds of reſolution for this matter &amp; conceive that any more particular difficulty will be ſalved by the application of theſe grounds to it, and ſo not object what was obvious to have done, the example of the theife on the croſſe which is ſo common ground of ſecurity, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption to carnall livers; becauſe I already diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne reaſon to thinke his ſtate the ſtate of true <hi>contrition</hi> and <hi>converſion,</hi> and not onely of <hi>attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> becauſe in thoſe minutes he lived on the

croſſe, he gave ſuch evidence of this in confeſſing and praying to Chriſt, when his owne Diſciples had forſaken him: and beſide, Chriſt who know his ſincerity and will not accept the unſincere, revealed to him his acceptance of him.

               <p>I ſhall do it, and that moſt clearely by bringing downe the ſenſe of the whole chapter from the begining to this place in this breife paraphraſe; do you looke u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the words in your Bible, whilſt I do it. <hi>v. 1. Gods love to us is very great in that he hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted us Chriſtians to be his Children,</hi> (which by the way is the reaſon that the <hi>world</hi> which <hi>rejected Chriſt, rejecteth us alſo.) (v. 2.) &amp; being children, though we know not exactly the future benefit which ſhall accrue to us by this meanes, yet this we know, that when this ſhall be revealed to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61219:51"/>
us, we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is, and that viſion will aſſimilate us to him, (v. 3.) &amp; the very hope of it now hath the ſame power of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king us pure, as he is pure.</hi> (for 1, Hope includes deſire and love of the thing hoped for, which being Heaven, a place of purity, the hope of Heaven muſt include a deſire of purity, and therefore the Heaven that the ſenſuall man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, if he deſire it for the preſent, is a mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heaven; and if it be the true Heaven the ſtate of purity, then he deſires it not for the preſent, but hereafter when ſenſuall pleaſures have forſaken him. And 2 the condition of Gods promiſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our purification or ſanctification, and the particular condition of this <hi>ſeeing God,</hi> being Holyneſſe, 'tis madneſſe for us to hope any thing but upon thoſe grounds, and therefore he that hath this hope of ſeeing him or being like him hereafter, labours to become like him now, in purity, (a ſpeciall imitable quality of his) And <hi>(v. 4.) he that wants it, (i. e. every one that committeth ſin) is guilty of the breach of the law, of this Evangelicall law of his; &amp; that ſin it ſelfe is that breach, upon which conſequently followes the forfeiture of thoſe promiſes contained in it, (v. 5.) and to that end, that we, for whom he dyed, ſhould not thus ſinne, it was without doubt that he came amongſt us, and ſinne or any ſuch impenitent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter of ſinne, is not in him, (v. 6.) For every one
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61219:51"/>
that remaineth in him, as a member of his ſinneth not wilfull deliberate ſinnes; if any man do ſo, pretend or profeſſe, be what he will, he hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeene nor knowne</hi> Chriſt <hi>(v. 7.) I pray ſuffer not your ſelves to be deceived, Chriſt you know is righteous, and the way to be like him is to be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous alſo, and that cannot be but by doing righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, living a conſtant Chriſtian life, (v. 8.) He that doth dot ſo, but goes on in a courſe of ſin, is of the Devill, and by his actions expreſſes the ſtocke he comes of. For 'tis the Devill that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his age with ſinne, and ſo continued it, and ſo ſin is his trade, his worke, &amp; this was a ſpeciall part of the end of Chriſts comming, to deſtroy his trade, to diſſolve that fabricke he had wrought, i. e. to turne ſinne out of the world, (v. 9.) and therefore ſure no child of God's, none of that ſuperiour ſtocke will go on in that accurſed trade, becauſe he hath God's ſeed in him,</hi> that originall of <hi>cognation</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and him, <hi>Gods grace, that principle of his new birth, which gives him continuall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes to ſin, ſuch as</hi> (though they doe not force or conſtreine him not to yeild to Satans temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, yet) <hi>are ſufficient to enable him to get out of thoſe ſnares;</hi> and if he be a Child <hi>of God, of Chriſts making, like him that begat him in purity, &amp;c. he cannot, he will not thus go on in ſinne, (v. 10). So that hereby you may clearly diſtinguiſh a child of God, from a Child of the Devill, he
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61219:52"/>
that doth not live a righteous and charitable life,</hi> (to do <hi>juſtice, and to love mercy,</hi> as Micah ſaith) <hi>is no child of Gods, hath no relation of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinity to him. I ſhall</hi> need proceed no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by this you will underſtand the ſence of the verſe to be this, and no more. <hi>Thoſe that are like Chriſt, and ſo God's children, 'tis ſuppoſed that they have ſuch a ſeed or principle of Grace in them, that inclines them to diſlike, and enables them to reſiſt all deliberate ſinnes; and if they doe not make that uſe of that grace, ſure they are not like Chriſt, none of his fellow-Sonnes of God:</hi> a regenerate man remaining ſuch, will not, nay morally cannot do ſo; ſo doing is contrary to a regenerate ſtate.</p>

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61219:52"/>
you, I ſhall anſwer by degrees, 1. That there is a double ſtrife in a man, the one called a warre betwixt the <hi>law in the members and the law in the minde,</hi> the other the <hi>luſting betwixt the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and the fleſh.</hi> The former <hi>betwixt the law in the members, and in the mind,</hi> is the perſwaſions of ſinne or carnall objects on one ſide, and the law of God, inviting us on the other ſide, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding us the contrary; and in this caſe, <hi>the law,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>being weake,</hi> and not able of it ſelfe to helpe any man to do what it commands him, it muſt needes follow, that they that have no other ſtrength, but the bare light of the <hi>law in the minde,</hi> no grace of Chriſt to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteine them in their combats, will by their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall appetite be led to do thoſe things, which the law tells them they ſhould not; which if they do and continue in them, this condition you will have no colour of reaſon to miſtake for a regenerate ſtate, 1. Becauſe it is the ſtate of him only that knowes <hi>the law</hi> (which is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to quicken or renew) conſidered without the grace of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is neceſſary to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man, 2. Becauſe this <hi>law in the minde,</hi> when it is not obeyed, but deſpiſed, doth ſerve only to teſtify againſt us, that we <hi>knew our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters will, and did it not, i. e.</hi> that what we did, was againſt thedictates of our owne conſcience, which ſure will never helpe to excuſe a ſinne
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:61219:53"/>
(but tather to aggravate it) or conſequently to make that act reconcileable with a regenerate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, which otherwiſe would not be ſo; and therefore 2. Of this kinde of compoſition of a man, when his minde or upper ſoule being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in its duty diſlikes the ſinnes he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, and yet he continues to commit them, you may reſolve, that this ſtriving or this diſlike of his mind is no excuſe or Apology for his ſinne, much leſſe any argument of his regeneracy or good eſtate; but on the other ſide his <hi>ſerving of, or captivity to the law of ſinne in his members, is all one with the reigning of ſinne in his body to fulfill the luſts thereof,</hi> and that a ſure token of an unregenerate: for of every regenerate 'tis ſaid 1 <hi>Joh. 5. 4. that he overcommeth the world,</hi> which is quite contrary to <hi>being ſold under ſinne</hi> (a phraſe referring to the <hi>Romans</hi> cuſtome of ſelling of ſlaves under a ſpeare) or to that which is ſaid of <hi>Ahab. 1 King. 21. 25. that he was ſold</hi> (the Greeke reading) <hi>to do evill,</hi> being a <hi>ſlave of ſin,</hi> or <hi>ſerving with the fleſh the law of ſin,</hi> &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you may conclude, that he, whoſoever it is, <hi>that with the minde ſerves the law of God. i. e.</hi> approves of Gods command, or <hi>conſents to it, that it is good,</hi> and yet <hi>with the fleſh, the members, ſerves the law of ſinne,</hi> not only commits ſome act of ſinne, but lives indulgently in it, and is thereby enſlaved to it, is never to be counted of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:61219:53"/>
as a regenerate man, but only as one that by the law is taught the knowledge of his duty, but by that bare knowledge is not enabled to performe it.</p>

               <p>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly it may, and in ſome degrees will be, as long as we carry fleſh about us, for the <hi>fleſh</hi> will alwayes diſlike what the <hi>ſpirit</hi> likes; but then, we muſt be ſure that the <hi>fleſh</hi> do not carry it againſt the <hi>ſpirit. i. e.</hi> do not get the conſent of the will to it, for if it do, <hi>luſt conceives and brings forth ſinne,</hi> even thoſe <hi>workes of the fleſh</hi> mentioned <hi>v,</hi> 19. for though this <hi>lucta</hi> be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable with a regenerate ſtate, <hi>i e.</hi> that a man may be regenerate for all this, yet it is not an argument of a regenerate eſtate, ſo that every one that hath it, ſhall by that be concluded re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate; for if the <hi>fleſh</hi> carry it from the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> to <hi>fulfill the luſts thereof,</hi> it ſeemes that man <hi>walkes not in the ſpirit. v.</hi> 16. and conſequently is not in a regenerate ſtate.</p>

               <p>I told you, frailties and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and alſo ſinnes of ſuddaine ſurreption,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:61219:54"/>
and thoſe that by daily incurſion, continuall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, at ſome time or other gained in upon us, (ſo they were as ſuddainly taken and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of) were reconcileable with a regenerate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate; and therefore if it proceed no farther, it is onely mixture of the fleſh in our beſt actions, or elſe ſlips and trips, or falls ſuddainly recovered againe; but not <hi>carnality, or walking after the fleſh.</hi> And for theſe you know the remedy I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed you, daily prayer for pardon for daily ſlips, and daily caution and care and endeavour to prevent them. But as for indulgence in, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of carnality, 'tis not the <hi>luſting of the spirit againſt the fleſh</hi> that will excuſe them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>workes of the fleſh,</hi> or him that is guilty of them from being <hi>carnall.</hi> For it being too too poſſible and ordinary for the <hi>luſtings of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, i. e.</hi> ſpirituall motions to be reſiſted, it will be little advantage to any to have had theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, unleſſe he have obeyed them, <hi>i. e.</hi> unleſſe he <hi>walke in the spirit,</hi> and be <hi>led by it:</hi> for to ſuch onely it is that there <hi>is no condemnation, Ro.</hi> 8. 1.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>If you take that vow and that wiſh to be all one, you are miſtaken; a wiſh is a farre lower degree then a vow; and therefore I
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61219:55"/>
muſt diſſolve your demand into two parts; and to the firſt anſwer, that the <hi>vow</hi> or <hi>reſolution to amend,</hi> if it be ſincere, and ſuch as is apt to bring forth fruits, is ſure to be accepted by God; and that it is not ſincere we ſhall not be able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerne, but by ſeeing it prove otherwiſe in time of temptation: onely God that ſees the heart, can judge of it before ſuch triall, and if he finde it ſincere, he will accept of it. But for <hi>the wiſh that I were penitent,</hi> there is no promiſe in holy writ that that ſhall be accepted, nor appearance of reaſon, why he, that wiſhes he were peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but is not, ſhould be accounted the better for that wiſh; 1. Becauſe when the reward of penitents, and puniſhment of impenitents is once aſſented to as true, 'tis impoſſible but the minde of man ſhould wiſh for the one, and have diſlikes to the other, and ſo no virtue in that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. 2. Becauſe that wiſhing is onely a bare, aiery, ſpeculative act of the minde, and not a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall of the will, which alone is puniſhable or rewardable. 3. Becauſe the actions being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to ſuch wiſhings are more accuſable of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate ſinne, and ſinne againſt conſcience; then if thoſe motives which produced thoſe wiſhes, had never beene repreſented to the faculty.</p>

But yet if the whole worke be no more but this, if he be advanced no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther toward repentance, but onely to wiſh, and to pray that he were penitent, this perſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines ſtill impenitent, and ſo long the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents portion belongs to him, and none other; for ſtill <hi>he that is borne of God overcometh the world:</hi> and he that is advanced no farther toward a victory, then to wiſh or pray for it, is for that preſent farre enough from a conquerour; and if for the future he adde not the ſincerity of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to the importunity of prayer, the <hi>Joſhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a's</hi> hand's held up to fight, as well as the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſes</hi>

I am not glad that you have met with that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlety, yet ſeeing 'tis proper to the particular we are upon, and that a branch of a practicall point, I will endeavour to ſatisfy you in it. 1. By grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth of your rule, that to make both parts of a contradiction true, is abſolutely impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, a thing which Gods infinite power and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity makes as unfit for God to be able to doe, as to lye, or ſinne; becauſe it were not an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, but defect of power, to be able to doe theſe. But then, ſecondly you muſt know what is meant by contradictions, nothing but affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and negation of the ſame thing in all the ſame reſpects; as to be and not to be; to be a man, and not a man; to be two yards long, and not two yards long; which therefore are thus abſolutely impoſſible to be done, even by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power. But then thirdly, That which you called reaſon's contradicting of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is a very diſtant thing from this. For when reaſon ſaith one thing, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> the contradictory to that, reaſon doth not oblige me to beleive reaſon; or if it doth, it bids me disbeleive <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſo ſtill I beleive not contradictories, which ſoever of the contradictories I beleive; all that reaſon hath to doe in this caſe, is to judge which is likelieſt to judge of, or affirme the truth; it's ſelfe, or God; wherein if it judge of it's owne ſide againſt God, it is very partiall and very A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſticall:
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:61219:57"/>
it being very reaſonable, that God which cannot lye, ſhould be beleived, rather then my owne reaſon, which is often deceived in judging of naturall things, it's onely proper object; but is quite blind in ſupernaturall, till God be pleaſed to reveale thoſe unto it. The ſhort is, reaſon tells me, and in that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it ſhould erre, eſpecially God having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed nothing to the contrary, it is doubtleſſe that it doth not erre) that theſe two propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons cannot be both true, there is another life, and there is not another life; and therefore I am not bound by <hi>Chriſt</hi> to beleive both; but it doth not tell me, that to affirme another life implies a contradiction, but onely that it is <hi>above reaſon</hi> to diſcerne how there can be a returne from a totall privation to a habit againe, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things ſuppoſed in the Reſurrection, which though nature cannot doe, and conſequently naturall reaſon cannot tell how they are done, yet reaſon may acknowledge the God of nature can doe, and will doe, if he ſaith he will; and illuminated reaſon having revelation of this will of God's, muſt and doth beleive they ſhall be done, or elſe makes God a lyar.</p>

According to that Covenant he ſends his ſpirit, and by the word and that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to it he calls the ſinner powerfully to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; If he anſwer to that call, and awake, and ariſe, make his ſincere faithfull reſolutions of new life; God then 4. Juſtifies, accepts his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and pardon's his ſinnes paſt: Then 5. gives

him more grace, aſſiſts him to <hi>doe,</hi> (as before he enabled to <hi>will,)</hi> to performe his good reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions.

               <p>That he went up <hi>to the Mount,</hi> was to intimate the matter of this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to be the Chriſtian law, as you know the Jewiſh law was delivered in a <hi>Mount,</hi> that of

                  <hi>Sinai.</hi> And that he would have no auditours, but Diſciples, It was, 1. Becauſe the multitude fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him not for doctrines, but for cures; <hi>c.</hi> 4. 24, 25. And therefore were not fit auditours of precepts. 2. Becauſe theſe precepts were of an elevated nature, above all that ever any Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver gave before; and therefore were to be diſpenſed onely to choiſe auditours. 3. Becauſe the lights and myſteries of Chriſtianity are not wont to be abruptly diſpenſed, but by degrees, to them that have formerly made ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe, (at leaſt have delivered themſelves up to Chriſt's Lectures, entred into his Schoole) <hi>i. e.</hi> to his Diſciples.</p>

               <p>That it was given onely to Diſciples then, it may be acknowledged; but that will be of latitude e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to conteine all Chriſtians; for to be a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple of Chriſt,</hi> is no more then ſo; for you know Chriſt firſt called Diſciples, and they followed him ſome time, before he ſent them out, or gave them commiſſion to preach, &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> before he gave them the dignity of <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> of which as onely the Miniſters of the Goſpell are their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours, ſo in Diſcipleſhip all Chriſtian profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours.

               <p>The proper'ſt rules for the defining it, will be theſe. 1.

If it be matter neither defined, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be defined in Scripture, then with each particular man among us, the definitions of the Church wherein we live, muſt carry it, ſo farre as to require our yeilding and ſubmiſſion; and with that Church which is to define it (if it come in lawfull aſſembly to be debated) the tradition of the Univerſall, or opinion of the primitive Church, is to prevaile, at leaſt to be hearkened to with great reverence in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; and that which the greater part of ſuch a lawfull aſſembly ſhall judge to be moſt agreeable to ſuch rule, or (in caſe there is no light to be fetch't from thence, then) that which they ſhall of themſelves according to the wiſedome given them by God, agree upon to be moſt conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, ſhall be of force to oblige all inferiours. 1. Not to expreſſe diſſent. 2. To obedience. But 3. If Scripture be pretended for one party in the debate, and the queſtion be concerning the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:61219:69"/>
of that Scripture, and no light from the Scripture it ſelfe, either by ſurveying the context, or comparing of other places, be to be had for the clearing it, then againe the judgment of the univerſall or my particular Church, is to be of great weight with me; ſo farre, as if it command, to inhibit my venting my owne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion either publiquely, or privately, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne to gaine proſelytes; or if all liberty be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely left to all in that particular, then meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe requires me to enjoy my opinion, ſo as that I judge not any other contrary-minded.</p>

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61219:70"/>
is matter of infinite delight. 1. In conquering that mad, wild, devilliſh paſſion of revenge; getting victory over one's ſelfe, which is the greateſt act of valour, the thought of which is conſequently moſt delightfull. 2. In conquering the enemy, of which there is no ſuch way, as the <hi>ſoft anſwer,</hi> which, ſaith the wiſe man, <hi>turneth away wrath;</hi> and feeding the hungry enemy, which, ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> is <hi>the heaping live coales upon his head;</hi> and that the way that Metalliſts uſe to melt thoſe things, that will not be wrought on by putting of fire under them, which he expreſſes by <hi>overcoming evill with good.</hi> 3. In conquering or out-ſtripping all the fooliſh and heathen world, which had never attained to this skill of <hi>loving of enemies,</hi> which is onely taught Chriſtians by Chriſt. The honour of this muſt needs be a moſt pleaſant thing. 2. It is matter of <hi>preſent</hi> felicity to us, in reſpect of the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity and quiet it gaines us here, within our owne breaſts, a calme from thoſe ſtormes that pride, and anger, and revenge, are wont to raiſe in us. And 3. In reſpect of the quiet, peaceable living with others, without ſtrife, and debate, without puniſhments, and executions, that are the portion of the ſeditious turbulent diſobedient ſpirits. Which is the meaning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly of the promiſe in the Pſalmiſt, the <hi>meeke ſhall inherit the earth, i. e.</hi> ſhall generally

               <p>I ſhall, by ſaying theſe foure things to you. 1. That though to be <hi>perſecuted</hi> is no duty of ours, yet. 1. To beare it patiently, and 2. Rejoyce in it when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls us, and 3. That it be for righteouſneſſe ſake, when it is our duty required of all Chriſtians. 2. The very being <hi>perſecuted,</hi> though it be not a duty againe, is yet a marke and character of a Chriſtian; and the Scripture doth ſeeme to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that no good Chriſtian ſhall ever be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his part in it. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 6. &amp;c. And it will be hard for any to find out one holy man that hath paſſed through his whole life without this portion. 3. If it ſhall not be ſo generall a rule as to be capable of no exception, but ſome good Chriſtians be found, which are not <hi>perſecuted,</hi> yet ſtill the preparation of minde for this indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, is neceſſary to every Chriſtian. 4. The being <hi>perſecuted</hi> ſhall contribute much to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of our glory, and ſo may ſtill be ſaid ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:61219:80"/>
reſpectively (though it ſhould not be affirmed abſolutely) to the attaining of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of glory: and therefore this is placed after all the reſt, as a meanes of perfecting &amp; conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating the Chriſtian, that as the former ſeaven are neceſſary to the attaining a crowne at all, ſo this to the having ſo rich a crowne, or ſo many gemms in it.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, eſpecially two things. 1. That the grace firſt named is a generall principall grace, which is the foundation of all the reſt. Where that is once ſeated and planted, all the reſt will more eaſily and more happily follow. <hi>Humility</hi> is the ſeed-plat of all, and from thence it is moſt proper to proceed, 1. To <hi>mourning</hi> or ſorrow for ſinne; the <hi>humble</hi> heart is a melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart. 2. To <hi>meekeneſſe</hi> and quietneſſe of ſpirit; the <hi>humble</hi> heart is the next degree to that already. 3. To <hi>hungring and thirſting after righteouſneſſe;</hi> the <hi>humble</hi> heart will moſt impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently deſire both pardon of ſinne (that firſt kinde of righteouſneſſe) and grace, to ſanctify, (that ſecond kinde of righteouſneſſe.) 4. To <hi>mercifullneſſe;</hi> the <hi>humble</hi> heart will be moſt ready to give and forgive, 5. To <hi>purity of heart;</hi> the <hi>humble</hi> heart is moſt unreconcileable with all filthineſſe both of the fleſh and ſpirit: but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:61219:80"/>
the latter, of which pride, a cheife particular, is the direct contrary to humility. 6. To <hi>peaceableneſſe,</hi> contention being generally the effect of pride. 7. To <hi>perſecution and revile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> humility 1. being apt to tempt the proud worldlings to revile and perſecute. 2. being ſure to worke patience of them in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>The interchangeable mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of theſe graces; one toward God, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther toward man: thus interweaved, that the firſt reſpects God, the next man; the next God againe, and ſo forward till it comes to the laſt, which reſpects God againe. For having told you, that the firſt is a generall fundamentall grace, as the head to all the reſt, it followes that the ſecond, that of <hi>mourning,</hi> muſt be the firſt particular, which being faſtened particularly on ſinne, reſpecteth God, againſt whom we have ſinned: then next to that, <hi>meekeneſſe</hi> reſpecteth our neighbour eſpecially; and 3. <hi>hungring</hi> and <hi>thirſting</hi> after righteouſneſſe, (which is all to be had from God) reſpecteth God. <hi>Mercifull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> againe reſpecteth man. <hi>Purity</hi> in heart, God; <hi>Peaceableneſſe,</hi> man; and laſtly <hi>perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> for righteouſneſſe ſake, and patience of it, as comming from a conſideration and beleife of Gods provident diſpoſall of all things, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:61219:81"/>
God againe. So that you ſee the firſt and the laſt reſpecteth our duty toward God, who is <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the firſt and the laſt; and thoſe betweene, divided betweene our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and God. That ſo we may reſolve, that to God belongs the cheife, and firſt, and laſt of our love and obedience, yet ſo as not to exclude but require alſo in its ſubordination our care of duty and love toward man alſo; one intermixing lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly and freindly with the other, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther performed, as it ought, if the other be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>

               <p>Theſe eſpecially; Becauſe 1.

of the spirit, i. e.</hi> A meanes to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the ſpirit to our hearts, to enable to doe what he commands to doe; and then (as the Father ſaid) <hi>Lord give me ſtrength to doe what thou commandeſt, and command what thou liſteſt.</hi>

               <p>If this be true that <hi>Chriſt</hi> now requires more then under nature or <hi>Moſes</hi> had beene formerly required, at leaſt fully revealed to be required, How then is our Chriſtian <hi>burthen lighter,</hi> then the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> formerly was?

Which two things being ſuppoſed, the adding of theſe perfections to the law, (which are all of things gainefull and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and before (even by thoſe that were not, or thought themſelves not obliged by them) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be more excellent, and more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable then the other) will not in any reaſon be counted the increaſe of a burthen, (for no man will be thought oppreſſed by that he gaines by) but the gainefull yoke will be a light one, though it be a yoke, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 30.

               <p>Some glimmerings per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of this light there were before, as Goſpel under the Law: But theſe either, 1. not univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commanded to all under threat of eternall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, but only recommended to them that will do that which is beſt, and ſo ſee good daies, &amp;c.

               <p>God having ſole power over the life of man, may without doubt take it away by what way he pleaſeth, either immediately by himſelfe, or by any man, whom he appoints to execute his will: Thus you know might <hi>Abraham</hi> kill his ſonne when God bid him; becauſe though <hi>Abraham</hi> had not power over his ſon's life, yet God had;
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:61219:86"/>
and his bidding <hi>Abraham</hi> kill him, is not any thing contrary to this law, which only forbids man to do it, but doth not forbid God. In the like manner, God having <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 6. command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>murtherers bloud to be ſhed by man,</hi> and thereby enſtated the power of the ſword on the Supreme Magiſtrate, (who, by whomſoever he is choſen to be Magiſtrate, by God, or the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, hath that power of the ſword given him immediately from God, the people having not ſingly this power over their owne lives, and therefore not able to give it any other) not only permits him and makes it lawfull for him thus to puniſh malefactors, but commands and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires him ſo to do, as his <hi>miniſter to execute wrath.

               <p>But was nothing elſe forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the law by that Commandement, but killing?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>That was the prime eſpeciall matter of it, but by way of reduction other things which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory to this, or offences of this nature, but of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:61219:88"/>
a lower degree. As 1. Mutilating or maiming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mans body. 2. Wounding him, which may poſſibly endanger his life. 3. Entring into, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting, or offering of <hi>Duells,</hi> wherein I may kill or be killed, in which caſe, which ſoever it prove, I am guilty of murther. Nay if by the equality of fortune both come ſafely off, yet the voluntary putting my ſelfe on that hazard, is guilt enough for a whole ages repentance, and humiliation; to conſider what had become of me, if without repentance, I had thus falne a murtherer of my ſelfe and my fellow Chriſtian alſo.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>May no injury or affront be accounted ſufficient to provoke me to offer, or challenge to a Duell?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>None imaginable; for that injury, what ever it is, if it be a reall one, of a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nature, will be capable of legall ſatisfaction; and that muſt content me; private revenge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly prohibited by Chriſt. Or if it be ſuch, that the law allowes no ſatisfaction for, that is an argument that it is light and unconſiderable; and then ſure the life of another man, and the danger of my owne will be an unproportionable ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>Well, but if another ſend me a Challenge, may not I accept of it? especially when I ſhall be defamed for a Coward if I doe not?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Certainly I may not; the law of killing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraines me. And for that excuſe of <hi>Honour,</hi> it is <hi>Firſt,</hi> moſt unreaſonable that the obedience to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:61219:88"/>
Gods commands ſhould be an infamous thing. And then 2. If ſo impious a cuſtome hath prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, I muſt yet reſolve to part with reputation, or any thing, rather then with my obedience to God. Nay 3. You may obſerve, that there are two ſorts of cowardize, much differing the one from another; the one proceeding from feare of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beaten, or killed; the ſecond from fear of hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or killing another. The moſt valiant deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of dangers may be allowed to have a great deale of the ſecond of this, and will certainly have as much of it, as he hath either of good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or religion; and that will reſtraine Duells as much as the other. And might this but paſſe, as ſure it deſerves, for a creditable thing, the feare of the other kind of diſcredit would worke lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle upon us. For the world is now generally grown ſo wiſe, that a man may, without any diſhonour, feare being killed or hurt; and even to run away from ſuch dangers, being very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent, is creditable enough. The unluckineſſe of it is, that the other honeſt kinde of feare, that of hurting or killing another, is become the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infamous thing, the onely cowardize that is counted of. For the removing of which, you may obſerve, 4. That in a reaſonable eſtimation of things, he that for the preſerving of his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall venture to diſobey God, is ſure the greateſt coward in the World; he is more feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:61219:89"/>
of diſgrace and ignominy in the world, then any pious man is of violating the lawes of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reaſon, of offending God, or of incurring the flames of eternall Hell.</p>

               <p>But what am I to doe in caſe of Challenge offered to me?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>1. In conſcience toward God, to deny it, what ever the conſequents may be. 2. To offer a full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for any, either reall or ſuppoſed injury done by me, which hath firſt provoked the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenger. 3. As prudently as I can to ſignify (and by my actions teſtify the truth of that) that it is not the feare of dying, but of killing, not cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardize, but duty, which reſtraines me from this forbidden way of ſatisfying his deſire.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>But what if all this will not ſatisfy him, but he will ſtill thirſt my bloud, and accept of no other allay, but aſſault me, and force me either to deliver up my owne life, or try the uncertainty of a Duell?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>The utmoſt that in this extreme caſe can be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, I ſhall define to you, by this example which I have met with. Two perſons of quality meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a publicke place, the one paſſed an affront upon the other; the other bare it patiently in that preſence, but after ſent him a challenge; he ſent him a returne of acknowledgment of his fault, and readineſſe to give him any ſatisfaction that ſhould elſe be thought onto wipe off the injury; the other will not accept any other; he keepes his chamber, and for a long time uſeth all
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:61219:89"/>
care not to meet him in any place which would be ſeaſonable for fighting, and ſtill offers tender of ſatisfaction. At length it falls out they meet in a place where this could not be avoided. The challenger ſets upon him, he drawes in his owne defence, wound's him lightly, having done ſo, deſires againe that this may end the quarrell, or offers any other ſatisfaction; the challenger will not conſent, aſſaults againe, is killed; and ſo the Tragedy concluded with the cheife Actors life. That the ſurviver did any thing unlawfull in all this, all circumſtances conſidered, I cannot af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme; no man being bound to ſpare that other mans life, which he cannot ſpare without part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his owne. I conceive this may ſatisfie the utmoſt of your ſcruples in this matter, if I tell you, that this caſe taken with all the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is the only one I can give you wherein one of the two Duellers may be innocent. And you will be apt to deceive your ſelfe, if you ſeeke to finde out other caſes, and thinke to juſtifie them by this.</p>

               <p>But is there nothing elſe reducible to the prohibition of murther?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, 4. Oppreſſion of the poore, and not giving thoſe that are in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme diſtreſſe, according to that of the ſonne of <hi>Sirach; The poore mans bread</hi> (either that which he hath, or that which in extreme want he craves of thee) <hi>is his life, and he that deprives him of it
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:61219:90"/>
is a murtherer.</hi> 5. The beginnings of this ſinne in the heart, not yet breaking forth into action, as malice, hatred, meditating of revenge, wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſcheife, curſing, &amp;c. All theſe are reduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to this Commandement, as it was given in the law.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>Is there yet any thing elſe thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>One thing more there is, and that is, <hi>Warre,</hi> the conſideration of which is full of great difficulties. For though all unjuſt warre be ſimply forbidden under this ſixth command of the law, and it be evident enough, that ſome warres are unjuſt, as that of Subjects againſt the ſupreme power or Magiſtrate in any ſtate, that of one Prince or nation invading another for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging of their dominion or territories, &amp;c. And though indeed there be but few warres but ſinne againſt this Commandement, and in thoſe few that doe not, yet there be many actors in them, auxiliaries, ſtipendiaries, &amp;c. which have no lawfull calling to take part in that trade of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling men, (for ſo onely have they that doe it in obedience to their lawfull Magiſtrate) yet ſtill it is apparent, that ſome warre is lawfull; as that which hath had Gods expreſſe command; and that which is for the repreſſing of ſeditions and rebellions; and betwixt nation and nation, for the juſt defence of themſelves, and the repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of violence. But this laſt head of <hi>warres</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that wherein the greateſt difficulties lye, will
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:61219:90"/>
not be ſo proper for this place, as for another which we ſhall meet with, that of not reſiſting of evill, <hi>v.</hi> 39. And therefore to that place we ſhall referre it; as alſo that of private warre in caſe of aſſault.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>I ſhall then count of that debt, and not require payment till that time cometh: but proceed to demand.</p>
               <p>What Chriſt hath added to this letter of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaicke</hi> law thus explained?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>It is clearely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in theſe words, <hi>[But I ſay unto you, that whoſoever is angry with his brother without a cauſe] &amp;c.</hi> to the end of that verſe. Wherein there be three things forbidden by Chriſt. 1. <hi>Cauſeleſſe</hi> or <hi>immoderate anger,</hi> going no farther then the breaſt. 2. The breaking out of this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger into the tongue, but ſome what moderately: <hi>[Whoſoever ſhall ſay</hi> Racha. 3. A more violent railing, or aſſaulting him with that ſword of the tongue that anger hath unſheathed. <hi>[Whoſoever ſhall ſay thou foole.]</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>What doe you meane by the firſt of theſe?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>That <hi>anger</hi> which is either without any, or upon light cauſe; or, being upon any the juſteſt and weightieſt cauſe, exceeds the degree and proportion due to it; and this againe in either kind aggravated by the duration and continuance of it. And the Greeke word here uſed is a denotation of every of theſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>For the underſtanding of this, I deſire firſt to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any <hi>anger</hi> be juſt or no, in respect of the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:61219:91"/>
                  <hi>cauſe? and if ſo, what?</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> advice of being <hi>angry and not ſinning,</hi> though it referre there peculiarly to the not continuing or endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of wrath, <hi>[Let not the Sunne goe downe in thy wrath]</hi> doth yet imply, that ſome <hi>wrath</hi> may be lawfull in reſpect of the cauſe; for otherwiſe the non-continuance of it would not juſtify it from ſinne. The moſt juſtifiable cauſes of anger are, 1. When it proceeds from ſorrow that God is provoked; anger conceived for Gods ſake, <hi>Mark.</hi> 3. 5. without reflexion on our ſelves. 2. When for virtues ſake; to ſee that neglected, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, and the rules of it violated. 3. When for other mens ſake; ſtill without reflexion on our ſelves or any intereſt of ours. And each of theſe not in light triviall matters neither, but in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of weight; and ſo the cauſeleſſe anger is that which riſes upon ſlight or no cauſes, or thoſe wherein our owne intereſts are concerned; Which though they may be cauſes, are not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable cauſes of anger in us.</p>

               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>Having this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from you to underſtand cauſeleſſe <hi>anger,</hi> I ſhall eaſily anſwer my ſelfe for the other two cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which make it fit for Chriſt to prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit it. As 1. When 'tis immoderate and exceeds the degree and proportion due to it, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe may be done even when the cauſe is juſt. And 2. When it continues beyond the length of a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient paſſion; when, as the Apoſtle ſaith, the <hi>Sunne</hi>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:61219:91"/>
is permitted to <hi>goe downe upon our wrath.</hi> But I pray what is meant by that phraſe which is by Chriſt here repeated, and againe applyed to this cauſeleſſe <hi>anger,</hi> as before to killing, <hi>[ſhall be in danger of the judgment]</hi> ſure 'tis not that he thinkes it fit, that every Chriſtian that thus of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends ſhould be put to death, as even now you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted thoſe words?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>The meaning is, that the wrathfull man in another world ſhall be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to puniſhment as the homicide here, <hi>i. e.</hi> that wrathfullneſſe being ſo contrary to that meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, patience, humility required now by Chriſt, and being, as <hi>Solomon</hi> intimates, an effect of pride and hawtineſſe, is to be counted of as an Un-Chriſtian ſinne; which unleſſe it be mortified <note place="margin">Prov. 21. 24.</note> here by the grace of Chriſt, will coſt us deare in another world; though not ſo deare as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third mentioned in this verſe. The pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment in that court of judicature being the ſword, or beheading; which, though it be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy enough, is not yet ſo great as the two other which are after named.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>This of cauſeleſſe <hi>anger</hi> being thus clearely forbidden by Chriſt, and yet that that even good Chriſtians are ſo ſubject to fall into; what meanes will you direct me to, to mortify or ſubdue it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>1. A conviction of the danger and ſinne of it; not flattering our ſelves that either 'tis no ſinne, or ſuch as with our ordinary, frailties ſhall have it's
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:61219:92"/>
pardon of courſe. But 1. Such as is here under a heavy penalty particularly denounced againſt by Chriſt. And 2. is ſo oppoſite to thoſe graces of humility, meekeneſſe, patience, peaceableneſſe, bearing with one another, and forgiving one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, &amp;c. and required ſo ſtrictly by Chriſt of his Diſciples, i. e. all Chriſtians followers of him. 3. A conſideration of the unreaſonableneſſe of that ſinne, which is, 1. Unjuſt, being cauſeleſſe, or immoderate. 2. So much againſt what I would have done to me either by my brother, (it being a very painfull uneaſy thing to be under anothers wrath, eſpecially when ill words or blowes are joined with it; and that that no body would be under, if he could helpe) or by God himſelfe (whom I ſo oft diſpleaſe, and would be ſo ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry if he ſhould be wrath with me, even when juſtly he might. 3. The labouring againſt that bitter roote of pride in my heart, of which this is ſo neceſſary infallible an attendant. 4. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion upon my ſelfe, if t'were poſſible, in time of that paſſion, or elſe immediately after, when I come to my ſelfe againe out of that drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſoule, and conſidering how ill-favoured a hatefull thing it is; how like a tyger, a beare, or any the furiouſeſt beaſt rather then a man, it makes me; what a deforming us, putting us out of all that poſture of civility, that in our ſobriety we chooſe to appeare in. Yea and what a
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:61219:92"/>
painefull agony it was when I was under it, 5. To conſider how at ſuch time we are out of our owne power, apt to fall into thoſe oathes, acts of furies, indiſcretions, revealing of ſecrets, diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous expreſſions, &amp;c. in a few ſuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, which a whole age of repentance will not repaire againe. 6. A ſober vow or reſolution ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to permit my ſelfe to fall into ſo inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and dangerous a ſinne; that when I finde it a coming upon me, I may reſtraine it by remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, this was it that I thought fit to vow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt. 7. A watching over my ſelfe continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that I be not taken unawares. 8. Abſteining carefully from the leaſt indulgence to any begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of it; it being eaſier to keepe from any firſt degree of it, then yeilding to that, to reſtraine the farther degrees. 9. Avoiding temptations and provocations as much as I can; and ſo the company of thoſe who are ſubject to that ſinne. 10. Labouring with God in prayer for grace to mortify this in me. 11. Diverting in time of temptation, with ſome particular repeated ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations to God to ſuppreſſe at that time any ſuch exorbitant affection in me. Many other conduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meanes you will be able to ſuggeſt to your ſelfe.</p>

               <p>You have by this plenteous diſcourſe on this word, prevented my doubt, which would have beene, whether the laſt onely of theſe ſinnes, and not the two former, make a Chriſtian liable to hell fire; for now I perceive the meaning of it is that torture in the <hi>valley of Hinnom.</hi> And that to expreſſe a third greater degree of puniſhment in another world anſwerable to that third degree of ſinne; and that nothing elſe is to be collected from it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall onely trouble you with one ſcruple in this matter, and that is, whether all kind of calling <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha</hi> or <hi>foole,</hi> i. e. all contumelious speaking of a greater or leſſe degree, be ſuch a ſinne puniſhable in a Chriſtian in another world?</p>

By interpoſing one caution obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable in theſe words; It is not all uſing of thoſe words, but that which is the effect and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of cauſeleſſe immoderate anger; for you ſee they are here ſet as higher degrees of that. And therefore, 2. Thoſe ſpeeches that proceed from any thing elſe, particularly when they are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by thoſe to whom the office and duty of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſeing others belongs, as Maſters, Teachers, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours in any kinde, (nay perhaps equalls too, who in charity are obliged to reprove the neighbour, and not ſuffer ſinne on him) And by them, 1. Done to that purpoſe that they may by theſe goads wake them out of a lethargy of ſin;
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:61219:94"/>
And againe, 2. Done ſeaſonably, ſo as they be in prudence moſt likely to worke good effect. And 3. Upon great and weighty cauſes; And 4. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeking any thing to themſelves, either the venting of inordinate paſſion; or the ambition and vanity of ſeeming ſeverer then others, or ſo much better then thoſe whom they thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; theſe all this while are not ſubject to this cenſure or danger. And of this nature you may ſee in the New Teſtament theſe ſeveralls, <hi>Ia. 2. 20. O vaine man,</hi> i. e. <hi>literally,</hi> Racha. <hi>Mat. 23. 17. The fooles and the blind,</hi> ſpoken by Chriſt. And againe, <hi>v.</hi> 19. and <hi>Luk. 24. 25. Ye fooles, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Gal. 3. 15. O fooliſh Galatians,</hi> and <hi>v. 3. are yee ſo fooliſh?</hi> Which is directly the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion <hi>[thou foole]</hi> which now you will ſee and diſcerne eaſily (if you conſider the affection of the Speakers,) to be out of love, not cauſeleſſe inordinate paſſion, and ſo not liable to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in this text. But then 3. There is little doubt but that all detraction, cenſoriouſneſſe, back bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, whiſpering, that ſo ordinary entertainment of the world to buſy our ſelves when we meete together in ſpeaking all the evill we know, or perhaps know not, of other men, is a very great ſinne here condemned by our Saviour, and upon his advertiſement timely to be turned out of our communication; as being moſt conſtantly againſt the rule of doing as I would be done to; no man

               <p>I beſeech God to lay this to my heart, that by his aſſiſtance I may be enabled to ſuppreſſe and mortify this inordinate paſſion, that my nature hath ſuch inclinations unto; to that end, to plant that meekeneſſe, and patience, and humility, and charity in my heart that may turne out this unruly creature; to arme me with that continuall vigilance over my ſelfe that it may not ſteale upon me unawares; but especially to give me that power over my tongue, that I may not fall into that greater condemnation.</p>
               <p>But I ſee you have not yet done with this theme; for before our Saviour proceeds to any other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, I perceive he buildeth ſomewhat elſe on this foundation in the foure next verſes. <hi>[There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if thou bring thy gift to the Altar, &amp;c.]</hi> Be pleaſed then to tell me, 1.

Our Saviour had mentioned the danger of <hi>raſh anger and contumelies, &amp;c.</hi> And becauſe through humane infirmity he ſuppoſes it poſſible that Diſciples or Chriſtians may thus miſcarry, he therefore addes the neceſſity of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent repentance and ſatisfaction after it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, 1. That the time immediate before the performing of any holy duty, of prayer, of obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of faſting, of receiving the Sacrament, &amp;c. is the fitteſt and properſt time to call our ſelves to account for all the treſpaſſes and injuries we are guilty of toward God and men. <hi>[If thou bring thy gift, and there remembreſt, v.</hi> 23.] That it ſeemes a ſeaſon of remembring. 2. That though the not having made my peace with thoſe whom I have offended, make me unfit for any ſuch Chriſtian performance, and ſo require me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre that till this be done; yet can it not give me any excuſe to leave that Chriſtian perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:61219:96"/>
undone, but rather haſten my performance of the other, that I may performe this alſo. He that is not yet reconciled muſt not carry away his gift, but <hi>leave it at the Altar, v.</hi> 24. And <hi>goe and be reconciled,</hi> and then <hi>come</hi> backe and <hi>offer his gift.</hi> He that is not in charity or the like, and ſo unfit to receive the Sacrament, muſt not think it fit or lawfull for him to omit or neglect that receiving, on that pretence, (or if he doe, t'will be a double guilt) but muſt haſten to recover himſelfe to ſuch a capacity that he may with cleane hands and heart, thus come to Gods table whenſoever he is thus called to it. 3. That a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent reconciled ſinner may have as good confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his approaches to God as any, <hi>[Then come, &amp;c. v.</hi> 24.] 4. That the putting off or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of ſuch buſineſſes as theſe of reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſatisfaction, &amp;c. 1. Is very dangerous. And 2. The danger of them paſt reverſing, when it cometh upon us. 5. That there is no way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this, but in time of life and health, quickly, inſtantly to doe it, the next houre may poſſibly be too late. <hi>Agree quickely whil'ſt thou art in the way, v.</hi> 25. 6. That the puniſhment that expects ſuch ſinners is endleſſe, indeterminable, the <hi>till thou haſt paid, v.</hi> 26. is not a limitation of time, after which thou ſhalt come out, (any more then <hi>[ſhe had no children till ſhe died]</hi> is a marke or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation of her having children after death) but

               <p>Yes, clearely, that which is here named in <hi>caſe of fornication i. e.</hi> If the wife prove falſe to the husbands bed, and take in any other man, t'will then be lawfull by Chriſts law for the husband to give her a <hi>Bill of Divorce, i e.</hi> legally to ſue it out, and ſo put her away. The reaſon being becauſe of the great inconveniences and miſcheifes that ſuch falſeneſſe brings into the family; children of anothers body to inherit with (or perhaps before) his owne, &amp;c. which ſort of reaſons it is that this matter of Divorce now under Chriſt, is cheifely built on, (and not, as might be imagined, that of the conjugall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, for that being mutuall, would as well make it lawfull for the wife to put away the husband, which is no where permitted in the Old or New Teſtament) this liberty being peculiar to the husband againſt the wife, and not common to the wife againſt her husband, becauſe I ſay thoſe family inconveniences doe not follow the falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the husband, as they doe that of the wife; to which may be alſo added one other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the wife hath by promiſe of obedience made her ſelfe a kinde of ſubject, and own'd him a Lord, and ſo hath none of that authority over him (an act of which, putting away ſeemeth to be) which he by being Lord hath over her.</p>

                  <hi>But me thinkes there is a place in Saint</hi> Paul, 1 Cor. 7. 12. <hi>from whence I might conclude that</hi> Chriſt <hi>hath named ſome other. For when Saint</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith that the</hi> brother, <hi>i. e. belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> having an unbeleiving wife, if ſhe be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to live with him, he muſt not put her away, <hi>he prefaceth it in this manner:</hi> To the reſt ſpeake I, not the Lord. <hi>Whence I inferre, that in Saint</hi> Paul'<hi>s opinion</hi> Chriſt <hi>had not then ſaid that</hi> unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife <hi>was not a lawfull cauſe of</hi> Divorce; <hi>and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently I conclude that</hi> Chriſt <hi>had left place for ſome other cauſe beſide fornication, and therefore I ſhould gheſſe that the naming of</hi> fornication <hi>here was not excluſive to all other cauſes, but onely to thoſe that were inferiour to it, (and that would make it contrary enough to what was by</hi> Moſes <hi>permitted, to wit,</hi> [for every cauſe] Mat. 19. 13.) <hi>and that if there ſhould be found any other cauſe as great as that, it might be conceived comprehended under that example named of</hi> fornication; <hi>and then I ſhall be bold to interpoſe my opinion, that ſure if the wife ſhould attempt to poiſon, or otherwiſe to take away the life of the husband, this would be as unſupportable an injury as adultery, and ſo as fit a cauſe of a Divorce, as that.</hi>

               <p>You have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed an objection of ſome difficulty. I muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply anſwer to it by dividing it into parts, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king my returnes ſeverally. 1. That in that place,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:61219:102"/>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. if the words <hi>[ſpeake I, not the Lord]</hi> did belong to the words immediately follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to wit, thoſe which you name, your collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from thence would be reaſonable. But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive they belong rather to the 15 <hi>verſe</hi> preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That <hi>in caſe the unbeleiver will not live with the beleiver, then upon her or his departure, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiver, man or woman, ſhall not be in bondage, (i. e.</hi> conſtreined to live unmarried,) but may freely marry in this caſe: and of this it may truly be ſaid, That <hi>Chriſt had ſaid nothing;</hi> and ſo, <hi>This ſpeake I, not the Lord.</hi> Now that this ſtands ſo farre from that preface, falls out, becauſe when the Apoſtle had reſolved to ſay this, that he might ſay it ſeaſonably, it was neceſſary for him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe thoſe other caſes, <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13. and give a reaſon for them, <hi>v.</hi> 14. and then this, <hi>v.</hi> 15. would come in intelligibly. If this interpretation be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, then the ground of the whole objection is taken away. And if it be objected againe, that by that liberty of Saint <hi>Pauls,</hi> the woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiver being put away by the infidell husband, is permitted to marry againe, which ſeemes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Chriſts ſaying, That <hi>he that putteth her away except in caſe of fornication, cauſeth her to commit adultery, and whoſoever ſhall marry her committeth adultery.</hi> For if in any caſe but forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſhe be cauſed to commit adultery, and he that marries her commit adultery, how in this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:61219:103"/>
caſe of unbeleife is ſhe free to marry? To this I anſwer alſo. 1. That if all this be granted, 'twill yet be nothing to the preſent purpoſe; for it concludes onely againſt Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> judgment; that he did contrary to <hi>Chriſts</hi> in giving this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, not that <hi>Chriſt</hi> had ſaid this, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, he had not ſaid, which is the onely thing that this objection is built on. But then, 2. Though that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> here ſaith, be ſomewhat which <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath not ſaid before, and ſo an example of <hi>[I, not the Lord]</hi> yet 'tis not oppoſite or contrary to what <hi>Chriſt</hi> had ſaid; for though <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſay, that <hi>he that divorces</hi> (not for fornication) <hi>cauſeth his wife to commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery;</hi> yet ſure his meaning is onely that as much as in him lyes, he <hi>cauſeth</hi> her, by putting her to ſome ill exigents, which may perhaps tempt her to harlotry; but not that he <hi>forceth</hi> her to this, infallibly or irreſiſtibly; for ſure 'tis poſſible one who is ſo divorced, may live chaſt; yea and though ſhe have leave to marry, live ſingle ever after. And that is the meaning of that phraſe, <hi>[cauſeth her to commit adultery.]</hi> You may be aſſured by this, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> mentions it onely as an aggravation of the mans fault, who by this puts her on that hazard, of which he is no whit leſſe guilty, though ſhe reſiſt that temptation, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape that danger. And for that part of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours ſpeech, <hi>[he that marries her that is divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:61219:103"/>
commits adultery]</hi> it belongs not to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for that <hi>[her]</hi> there, is not <hi>[her]</hi> that is divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for ſome other cauſe; for ſhe having meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing, no reaſon that ſhe ſhould be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by that bondage; or conſequently that he that marries her, being now free, ſhould be thought to offend; but the <hi>[her]</hi> is ſhe that is divorc't for fornication, and of ſuch an one it is very reaſonable on both ſides, though the truth is, <hi>Chriſt</hi> had affirmed nothing of it. Thus you ſee the place to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> cleared. I ſhall onely, (by the way,) adde, that v. 12. thoſe words <hi>[to the reſt]</hi> ſeeming to be oppoſed to the <hi>[the married] v.</hi> 10. as though he ſpake now to the <hi>reſt, i. e.</hi> thoſe that are unmarried, is a miſtake cauſed by the Engliſh Tranſlation, for thoſe that <hi>v.</hi> 12. he ſpeakes to, are married alſo. The word <note place="margin">

               <p>Having anſwered now your firſt part of the objection, I proceed to the ſecond, and anſwer, that there were againe ſome reaſon in the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, if <hi>firſt,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had thus affirmed, (which we have ſhewed he did not.) And 2. There could be produced any cauſe ſo juſtifiable for Divorce, as Adultery is. But of this I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that there can nonebe produced becauſe in all conſiderations none is ſo great and ſo irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:61219:104"/>
an injury, as this; none that repentance can ſo little ſet right againe, the poſſibility of which is one great reaſon why other injuries are not thought fit by <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be matter of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce. For though it be poſſible ſome other ſins may be as great or greater then adultery, (as ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, heatheniſme, for example) yet becauſe this is not ſo contrary to, and deſtructive of the conjugall ſtate, therefore 'tis not thought fit to cauſe Divorce, by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> (nor as appeares, by <hi>Chriſt</hi> neither) though to cauſe damnation, (which is farre greater puniſhment then Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce) it be aboundantly ſufficient. As for the having attempted the life of the husband, (which leades me to anſwer the laſt part of the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) I ſhall make no doubt to ſay this is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to the having committed adultery. For <hi>firſt,</hi> It appeares that though it was attemped, yet it was not acted, (fot if it had, that would have made a reall divorce indeed) and the attempt, 1. Is not ſo puniſhable, as the act; And 2. It may by repentance be repaired againe, and the reſt of the life be the more happy and comfortable with ſuch a penitent wiſe; and this very poſſibility is conſiderable: and that that was the reaſon why the beleiving husband is adviſed not to put away the unbeleeving wife, [for <hi>he knowes not whether he</hi> may not convert and <hi>ſave the heathen wife</hi> by living with her] hath place here alſo.

If there were dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being killed ſtill, yet may the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of living with one who hath beene falſe to the bed, be beyond that. <hi>Love is ſtrong as death, jealouſy cruell as the grave; the coles thereof are coles of fire, which hath a moſt vehement flame,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon.</hi> And if that be thus cauſed, what a hell is that mans life? and that is farre worſe then death, eſpecially then the meere danger of it; and beſide, if ſhe alſo have repented of her
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:61219:105"/>
fornication, and the husband be ſatisfied that ſhe hath ſo; yet the diſgrace of having beene ſo u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and perhaps the continuall preſence of a baſe brat in the family will be yet more unſupportable then that poſſible danger of looſing a life. For you ſee how ordinary it is for men to contemne their lives, to endanger, nay oft actually to looſe them rather then part with reputation or any ſuch trifling comfort of life; on this maxime of the naturall mans, that 'tis better to dye then live mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably or infamouſly. And though Chriſtianity curbe that gallantry of the world, yet ſtill it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to contemne life when it cometh in competition with obedience to him; which here it doth, or may doe, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> command (as his words affirme he doth) this not-divorcing for any kinde of cauſe, but fornication. The ſame might be ſaid in divers other things where we are apt to interpoſe the excuſe of extreme neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity <hi>(i. e.</hi> danger of looſing our lives) when we are not inclined to doe what God bids us doe. Where 1. If we did thus dye, it were martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and that the greateſt preferment of a Chriſtian. 2. Seeing 'tis but danger, and not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine death, we may well entruſt our lives in Gods hands by doing what he bids us; and thinke our lives ſafeſt when ſo ventur'd. And ſo I have ſatisfied your ſcruples.</p>

That it doth not interpoſe in the Magiſtrates office, ſo as to forbid him to puniſh by way of retaliation, if the lawes of the land ſo direct him for his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice being to preſerve the Kingdome in peace, <hi>Chriſt</hi> forbids not the uſe of any lawfull meanes to that end, but rather by the Apoſtle confirmes it in his hand, by ſaying, <hi>[he beareth not the ſword in vaine]</hi> and adding <hi>[he is Gods Miniſter, an avenger for wrath to him that doth ill.]</hi> By which is intimated that that ſword for <hi>vengeance,</hi> or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of offenders, which naturally belongs to God onely, is as farre as reſpects this life, put into the hands of the lawfull Magiſtrate, with commiſſion to uſe it, as the conſtitution of the Kingdome ſhall beſt direct, either by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliation, or otherwiſe; and what is done thus by him, is to be counted <hi>Gods vengeance</hi> execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him; and ſo no more contrary to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of private revenge, then Gods owne
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:61219:109"/>
retributions would be; which yet are mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Apoſtle as an argument to prove the unlawfulneſſe of ours, <hi>Rom. 12. 19. Avenge not your ſelves, but rather give place to wrath;</hi> leave all puniſhment to God, <hi>For it is written, vengeance is mine:</hi> By which connexion you may note by the way, that the motive why we ſhould not avenge our ſelves is (not that which ſome revengefull minds would be beſt pleaſed with, becauſe by our patience our enemies ſhall be damned the deeper, as ſome would collect from <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 20. but) becauſe the priviledge of puniſhing offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, <hi>i. e.</hi> of vengeance, belongs peculiarly to God, and to none but thoſe to whom for things of this life he is pleaſed to communicate it. Which I conceive to be the reaſon why upon this ground of <hi>vengeance belonging to God</hi> onely, ſet downe in the end of <hi>Rom.</hi> 12; The thirteenth to the <hi>Rom.</hi> begins with <hi>obedience to the higher powers, and their being ordained by God, &amp;c.</hi> This being thus ſet, it will follow 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. That Chriſts prohibition belongs onely to thoſe who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the injuries, conſidered (whatſoever they are) as private ſufferers; and thoſe are forbid two things; 1. Taking into their owne hands the avenging of themſelves. 2. (and which is the ſpeciall thing in this place, the former being not by the law permitted to the <hi>Jewes</hi> themſelves, though among the Heathen it was generally
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:61219:110"/>
thought lawfull to hurt them who had injured us) deſiring and thirſting, ſeeking and requiring e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that revenge which the law of man affords, with this reflexion on himſelfe, for the ſatisfying his revengefull humour. This might <hi>Chriſt</hi> very reaſonably prohibit, it being before not comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but onely permitted by <hi>Moſes</hi> law; though forbid the Magiſtrate thus to puniſh offenders he could not, without deſtroying that law, which indeed to have done would not be thought rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the greateſt part of the world being ſo farre from Chriſtians even now in times of Chriſtianity. Not that it is made utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull by <hi>Chriſt</hi> to proſecute any who hath wronged me; and bring him to legall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for that the law of man authorized and not contradicted by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> may and oft doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of me; and there is great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>revenge</hi> and <hi>puniſhment:</hi> Nor that it is unlawfull to require reparations for an injury done me when the matter is capable of it; nor to doe the ſame for the good that may accrue to my brethren by the inflicting ſuch exemplary puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on offenders; but that to require this for the ſatisfying of my owne revengefull humour <hi>beſides</hi> or <hi>without</hi> the reparation of the damage received by me, (as generally it is when I require <hi>an eye for an eye;</hi> for in that caſe the pulling out of his eye will contribute nothing toward the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:61219:110"/>
helping me to mine againe) or againe to require it in contemplation of the farther incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience that may poſſibly befall me another time if this paſſe unpuniſhed, is thought fit by <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be interdicted us Chriſtians; who are bound, 1. By gratitude for what <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath done to us in pardoning of injuries, to goe and doe likewiſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> to pardon and not revenge injuries. 2. By the law of faith to vanquiſh ſuch feares, and depend on Gods providence to defend us for the future, and not to be ſo haſty and follicitous in uſing all poſſible meanes, however unlawfull, for the future ſecuring of our ſelves. And all this ſeemes to be the literall importance of that phraſe, <hi>Rom. 12. 19. [Not avenging our ſelves,]</hi> Whatever avenging is lawfull, that is not which reflecteth <hi>upon our ſelves,</hi> and our owne immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate paſſions; whether that of anger, or that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of deſire, a branch of which is this wordly carking.</p>
               <p>From theſe two thus ſet it will appeare <hi>third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> what is to be ſaid of <hi>warres</hi> betweene one Kingdome and another, which are of a middle nature betweene the revenge of the Magiſtrate upon the offender within his juriſdiction, and the revenge of one private man upon another; this being betweene <hi>equalls,</hi> and ſo not of the firſt kind; and yet betweene <hi>publicke</hi> perſons or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and ſo not of the ſecond, which conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:61219:111"/>
will be onely ſo farre lawfull, as it agrees with the <hi>firſt;</hi> and unlawfull as with the <hi>ſecond.</hi>

               <p>In what respect may <hi>warre</hi> be lawfull? Or is it at all ſo?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>That it is not abſolutely unlawfull, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares 1. By the Baptiſts anſwer to the ſouldiers when they came to his Baptiſme, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. 14. where he forbids them not that calling as unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. 2. By <hi>Chriſts</hi> commending the <hi>Centurions</hi> faith who was then a Souldier. 3. By <hi>Pauls</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a band of ſouldiers againſt the Treachery of the <hi>Jewes.</hi> 4. By Saint <hi>Peters</hi> baptizing of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> without his giving over the military im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. Now in what reſpect warre may be lawfull, will appeare, if we obſerve the cauſes of it. 1. If it be for the ſuppreſſing of a ſedition or rebellion at home, it is clearely lawfull for the lawfull Magiſtrate, as having the <hi>power of the ſword,</hi> 1. To preſerve the peace of the land. And 2. To puniſh and ſuppreſſe the diſturbers of it. In which caſe it is impoſſible any warre ſhould be lawfull on both ſides; there being but one ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power in any Kingdome, (whether that conſiſt of one, or of more perſons) and to that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing the power of the ſword, which whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver elſe <hi>taketh into</hi> his hand in any caſe uſurpeth it, and therefore ought to <hi>periſh by the ſword.</hi> 2. If betwixt one Kingdome and another, then the warre may be lawfull againe, in caſe one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome doth attempt the doing any eminent inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:61219:111"/>
to another, which by a warre may poſſibly be averted from thoſe whom the Magiſtrates office binds him to protect. An <hi>eminent injury</hi> I ſay, and that which is more hurtfull then warre, or taking up of armes, and that againe, when there is no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitration, or other meanes of debating ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, or averting ſuch injuries to be had. And with theſe cautions, <hi>To hurt no peaceable man,</hi> as neare as may be; To ſhed as little bloud as is poſſible; Not to protract it out of deſire of revenge, or gaine; Not to uſe cruelty on captives, on thoſe that yeild themſelves, that deſire quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, on women, children, husbandmen, &amp;c. To give over warre when any reaſonable termes of peace may be had; To take away nothing from the conquered, but the power of hurting. In theſe caſes and with theſe cautions as it is lawfull to the Supreme Power to uſe armes, ſo is it alſo to others his Subjects that have commiſſion from him, if they be ſatisfied of the juſtice of the cauſe; it being not imaginable that any. Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate ſhould by his owne perſonall ſtrength pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect his Subjects without the aſſiſtance of others with him.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>But is it lawfull for a private man for the repelling of any the greateſt injury from himſelfe to kill another? Or if it be not, how can this warre againſt thoſe who are not our Subjects and Rebels, but thoſe who are out of our power, and over whom
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:61219:112"/>
we have no juriſdiction, and ſo we are but private men in respect of them) be accounted lawfull, ſeeing it is ſure more ſinfull to kill many then one?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>To the <hi>firſt</hi> part of your queſtion I anſwer, that a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man may not, by the law of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way anothers <hi>life,</hi> for the ſaving his owne <hi>goods,</hi> or the repelling any ſuch kind of injury from himſelfe, becauſe <hi>life</hi> is more then <hi>goods:</hi> but if his life be attempted alſo, and no probable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to ſave it but by taking away the others life, it may then be lawfull to take away his life; <hi>Chriſt</hi> having interpoſed nothing to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, (where yet he that to ſave anothers life, or rather then take it away, ſhould venture and loſe his owne, may be thought to doe better and more honourably, in imitating <hi>Chriſt</hi> who <hi>laid downe his life for his enemies.)</hi> This then being granted, I ſay yet to the <hi>ſecond</hi> part of your que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, that the ſame rule cannot be extended to the making of warre unlawfull. 1. Becauſe the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power who is ſuppoſed to mannage the warre, hath the ſword put into his hand by God, (which the private man had not;) and that not onely to <hi>puniſh</hi> Subjects, but alſo to protect them: 2. Becauſe it is his duty ſo to doe, which he may not, (without ſinne againſt them, and failing in diſcharge of truſt) neglect; whereas the private man having power of his owne goods, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede from that naturall right of his; deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:61219:112"/>
to follow <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and for his life it ſelfe may better thus part with it, by leaving it to Gods tuition, then the Magiſtrate can another mans, being entruſted by God to defend it, and by oath bound to performe that part of his duty. And for the number of thoſe whom a warre en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangers to kill, that will be countervailed with the number of thoſe whom it is intended to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, whoſe peace and quiet living, if it may be gotten, is more valuable to them then life it ſelfe deprived of that.</p>

               <p>Well then, ſuppoſing warre to be lawfull, and theſe two kinds of warres to be ſuch, What other kinde of lawfull warres are there? Or be there any more?</p>

               <p>It will be hard to name any other; and yet I ſhall not peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay there is no other, becauſe ſome other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may be found which will beare proportion to one of theſe.</p>
               <p>It will be eaſier to informe you in this matter by telling you what be the ſpeciall ſorts of wars that are unlawfull.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>1. When one Nation fighteth with another for no other reaſon but becauſe that other is not of the true <hi>Religion;</hi> this is certainly unlawfull. For 1. God hath not given any nation this juriſdiction over another. And 2. 'Tis againſt the nature of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be planted by violence or conſequently by the ſword; and therefore much more is this unlawfull for Subjects to doe, againſt the lawes
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:61219:113"/>
and governours under which they are placed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>It is the moſt precious thing indeed, and that to be preſerved by all lawfull, proper, proportionable meanes; but then warre or unlawfull reſiſtance being of all things moſt improper to defend, or ſecure, or plant this; and it being acknowledged unlawfull for <hi>Peter</hi> to uſe the ſword for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe, to doe it meerely for Religion, muſt needs be very unlawfull. Religion hath ſtill been ſpread &amp; propagated <hi>by ſuffering,</hi> &amp; not by reſiſting: and indeed it being not in the power of force to conſtreine my ſoule, or change my Religion, or keepe me from the profeſſion of it, armes or reſiſtance muſt needs be very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for that purpoſe.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>All manner of <hi>invaſive</hi> warre for the enlarging of our territories; for the reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of an affront; for the weakning of thoſe that we ſee proſperous, and conſequently ſuſpect it poſſible for them to invade us for the future; or in any caſe, unleſſe perhaps to get ſome repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſome eminent injury done to our nation which the nation cannot reaſonably beare, nor yet hope for any other way of reparation.</p>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Commiſſion from the Supreme Powers under which he lives, and to

whom he is a Subject, and who have the power of the ſword in their hand; and therefore as in obedience to them, it is poſſible for a private man lawfully to take armes, even when the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours do it unlawfully, ſuppoſing that he thinke the cauſe good upon the Supreme Powers undertaking it; ſo he that takes up armes only for hire, or hope of honour &amp;c. under one who is not his Magiſtrate, may, though the cauſe be juſt for which the Generall fights, commit ſinne in fighting under him.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Chriſt's foreſight of an objection, which upon occaſion of the prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion precedent, men would be apt to make, thus: If when one doth me an injury I may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge it on him my ſelfe, or require a legall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge upon him, then by this eaſineſſe he will be taught to multiply thoſe injuries; to ſmite me on the other cheeke, when he ſees me take that
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:61219:114"/>
ſo patiently; to take away my cloake alſo, if I am ſo tame as to let him carry away my coate without any payment; to make me goe a ſtage of two miles with him next time, if I take the firſt oppreſſion ſo patiently. To this foreſeen obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, our Saviour anſwers by commanding us to performe the former duty, and put this feared hazard to the venture, intimating that this is not ſure to be the reward and conſequent of ſuch pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. But yet if it ſhould be certainely ſo, yet we Chriſtians muſt rather ſubmit to this alſo, then give the raines to our revenge on that conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; we muſt venture that conſequent with <hi>Chriſt</hi> who hath commanded us this patience, and be armed for the worſt that can befall us in his ſervice. From whence you ſee what obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it is, that lyes upon us toward thoſe acts which are accounted ſo ridiculous among men. Not that we are preſently <hi>to turne the left cheeke to him that ſtrikes us on the right, to give the cloak to him that takes the coate, &amp;c.</hi> but to performe the precept of non-revenge, and not to be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from it by any foreſeene inconvenience: Yea and really to make that adventure, if I cannot performe that obedience without it, rather let <hi>him take the cloake alſo,</hi> then ſeeke wayes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge for ſuch former treſpaſſes. Which will be nothing unreaſonable, if we conſider, 1. That <hi>Chriſt</hi> can preſerve us from farther injuries if he
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:61219:114"/>
think good, as well without as with our aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and indeed that patience is oft bleſt by him to be a more proſperous meanes of this, then ſelfe revenge would be; it being Chriſt's tryed rule <hi>to overcome evill with good,</hi> 2. That if we ſhould chance to ſuffer any thing by obeying him, he will be able to repaire us in another world.</p>

               <p>That they are all tolerable and ſupportable injuries both in reſpect of what is done already, and what may be conſequent to our bearing them. For thus the <hi>loſſe of the coate,</hi> or <hi>cloake</hi> alſo is a moderate injury; the <hi>ſmiting on the cheeke</hi> or cheekes a very unconſiderable paine; and only valued for the contumely annext to it, which yet Chriſtians had beene before, <hi>v.</hi> 11. (and ſhould after by the ſufferings of <hi>Chriſt</hi> be) taught to ſupport cheerefully; and the <hi>going a mile</hi> or two a very tollerable invaſion on their liberty, and a very eaſie poſt, being compared with the ordinary ſtages, and from thence 1. The reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe and agreeableneſſe of Chriſts commands to our ſtrength appeares; that he provides us ſuch <hi>eaſie yoakes and light burthens.</hi> even when we thinke he uſeth us moſt hardly, 2. The indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence which he allowes us in matters of greater concernment; where the damage or treſpaſſe is not ſo ſupportable, he there intimates a liberty
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:61219:115"/>
to uſe ſome meanes to ſave or repaire our ſelves, (which may be extremely uſefull if not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to our temporall Subſiſtence) though not to worke revenge on the enemy for what is paſt, by exacting any puniſhment on his perſon, by endeavouring to trouble him, who hath troubled us, (which cannot bring in any profit to us.)</p>

               <p>For the loving of the Neighbour, <hi>i. e.</hi> the fellow <hi>Jew,</hi> it hath commanded to <hi>love him as thy ſelfe, Lev.</hi> 19. 18. and not to <hi>avenge</hi> nor beare any <hi>grudge againſt him;</hi> from which, though it were no excluſion of the like to other country-men, yet 'tis very true that the Jewes tooke occaſion of advantage to deny all kindneſſe and exerciſe of offices of common humanity to all others unleſſe they became Proſelytes to them, Now this they did without any authority of their law, which therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> by the parable of the good <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan,</hi> ſhewes to belong to the loving of (and ſhewing mercy to) others beſide their owne country men, and extending the meaning of the word <hi>[neighbour]</hi> to all thoſe who are of the ſame <hi>common ſtocke</hi> with us, and are <hi>men</hi> as well as our ſelves: though the truth is, God by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the <hi>Jewes</hi> peculiar meates, and forbiding others that were familiarly uſed by the Nations, did conſequently interdict them any ſpeciall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity of converſe with the Nations; by way of caution, leſt they ſhould be corrupted by them who were at that time ſo extremely Idolatrous; which rule conſequently was to be accounted
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:61219:117"/>
temporary, and to laſt no longer then the reaſon of it. But then, for the <hi>hating of enemies,</hi> it is not to be thought that there was any ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept given to them, of hating, either all but their owne country men, or even all their very enemies. Thus much only toward it we finde in the law, that though the <hi>Jewes</hi> were commanded to do courteſies to their enemies of their owne country, to <hi>reſcue the enemies Oxe out of the ditch, &amp;c.</hi> yet they are forbid to enter any friendſhip, affinity, league with the ſeven nations, <hi>Hittites, Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, &amp;c.</hi> or to ſhew any mercy to them; which yet muſt not be extended to the commanding all manner of mortall hatred againſt them, but this within certaine limits; they were to offer them conditions of Peace, and to permit them to redeeme their lives, if they deſired it, by ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, <hi>Deut.</hi> 20. 10, 11. and though upon not accepting of conditions of peace, they were to have no pity on them, but to deſtroy them ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, yet this belonged only to thoſe of that age; <hi>Solomon</hi> doth not ſo, but only levies a tribute of bond-ſervice upon them 1 <hi>King.</hi> 9. 20, 21. After the ſame manner were they to deale with the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malekites, to have warre with them for ever. Ex. 17. 16. Deut.</hi> 25. 19. and with ſome difference, with the <hi>Moabites,</hi> and <hi>Ammonites.</hi> In all which nothing can be obſerved contrary to the law of nature, or humanity; for the ſame power that
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:61219:118"/>
the Magiſtrates on earth have over malefactors, the ſame ſure muſt be yeilded God over Nations and Governours of them, to put them to death by what meanes he pleaſe. This execution he was pleaſed to commit to the people of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long time of patience, when <hi>thoſe natione had filled up the meaſure of their rebellion, Lev.</hi> 18. 14. So that this of <hi>hating enemies]</hi> cannot be accounted of as any common generall command, for it held not generally againſt any but theſe forenamed nations; but as a <hi>speciall, particular ſentence of Gods,</hi> to be at that time executed on them. And although, the truth is, the <hi>Jewes</hi> did generally reſolve it lawfull <hi>to kill</hi> or ſpoyle any that were <hi>ſtrangers</hi> from the religion of the true God; yet by the limiting of Gods command for ſuch execution to theſe forenamed, and that with this reaſon, becauſe they had <hi>fill'd up the meaſure of their iniquities</hi> (which when it is, none but God can judge of) 'tis evident that this was an errour in the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and that the rather becauſe at this time when <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpake, they were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and had no power of the ſword in their hands; in which caſe thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer commands of warre with <hi>Ameleck,</hi> (much more with other idolatrous Nations, againſt whom it was not appointed) became utterly out-dated, and the law of nature was to prevaile; which commends love and charity to all men.</p>

               <p>Doe you beleive, that liberality to the poore is likely to receive any ſuch reward in this life? The reaſon of my queſtion is, becauſe if there were any ground for the affirmative, I ſhould conceive it a moſt convincing motive to all, even the worldly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded men, to <hi>caſt their bread</hi> thus <hi>upon the waters;</hi> if it ſhould returne to them againe in this life with encreaſe. Liberality being a thing plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and delightfull even to fleſh and bloud, to the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:61219:126"/>
moſt covetous minded man; and nothing imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to deterre any from the practice of ſo lovely a duty, were it not the feare of diminiſhing our ſtore or bringing our ſelves to want by that meanes. I ſhall therefore in great earneſt deſire to heare your opinion in that point?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>I make no doubt of this truth, that mercifulneſſe and Chriſtian libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality is the ſureſt way to plenty and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this life; ſo farre from ever being a meanes of impoveriſhing any, that it is moſt conſtantly (when exerciſed as it ought) a meanes of enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And that you may not thinke this a phanſy or ſpeculation, or groundleſſe confidence in me, I ſhall tell you that I conceive there is not any one thing (temporall) for which there are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cleare evident promiſes in the Scripture as this. For the giving you ground of faith in this, I will name you ſome. And a foundation I ſhall lay, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 11. where there is by God preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed a forme of prayer to be uſed by him that <hi>hath made an end of tithing all the tith of his encreaſe the third yeare, i. e.</hi> that hath paid the poore their patrimony, (as appeares by the reſt of the verſe, and which till it be done, the third yeares <hi>tithing</hi> is not made <hi>an end of.)</hi> And the forme preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed gives the man that hath ſo done liberty and priviledge of claime and challenge to all kind of earthly bleſſings. <hi>v. 13. Then thou ſhalt ſay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord thy God I have given to the ſtranger,</hi>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:61219:126"/>
to the <hi>fatherleſſe, &amp;c.</hi> And thereupon, <hi>v. 15. Looke downe from heaven and bleſſe thy people</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and the land which thou haſt given us, a land flowing with milke and honey.</hi> The mention of the milke and honey, and affluence, is an interpretation what that bleſſing is which is there prayed for ſo confidently; to wit, temporall plenty here; and Gods preſcribing this forme of prayer is argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enough that God will grant it to him, that having performed this condition, doth humbly in prayer require the performance of ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. Onely by the way, theſe two things muſt goe together inſeparably, <hi>performance</hi> of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and then <hi>prayer</hi> to God. According to that of the blind man in the Goſpell, that he that is a <hi>worſhipper of God and doth his will, him he heareth.</hi> Other places fit to be ſuperſtructed on this you have in the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> of <hi>David, Pſal. 41. 1. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is he that conſidereth the poore and needy.</hi> And what kind of <hi>bleſſing</hi> this is, appeares by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, <hi>The Lord will deliver him, preſerve him, keep him alive, bleſſe him on the earth, &amp;c.</hi> And beſides others one remarkeable place that booke affords, <hi>Pſal. 37. 25. I have beene young, and now am old, yet ſaw I never the righteous forſaken, nor his ſeed begging bread.</hi> What is meant by the <hi>righteous</hi> there, will be evident, if you adviſe with <hi>v.</hi> 21.

Where although the rule doe not neceſſarily hold ſo farre, that no other meanes can make a mercifull man poore, (for perhaps negligence, ſuretyſhip, ſome other ſinne lived in and bringing a curſe upon him, may; and <hi>mercifulneſſe</hi> not prove antidote ſufficient to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him againſt all other poiſon.) Yet thus farre it doth in <hi>Davids</hi> obſervation hold, 1. That it never brings any man to want; whatever elſe may, that will not; 2. That it is an ordinary meanes to helpe to more wealth; to enrich the poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; to beſtow temporall bleſſings on them; a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne favourable influence this hath upon all that belongs to him. And this which <hi>David</hi> mentions as an <hi>Aphoriſme</hi> of his owne obſervation, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive I might extend to all times, and challenge any Hiſtorian of paſt, or obſervator of preſent times, to give one inſtance out of his knowledge
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:61219:127"/>
to the contrary; of any Chriſtian Almes-giver that brought himſelfe or his poſterity to want (nay that did not thrive and proſper the better) by that meanes. Some notable examples I have knowne in my time for the confirming what I now ſay, but could never yet heare of any to the contrary. To theſe I ſhall adde a few places of teſtimony alſo out of the Proverbs of <hi>Solomon, 11. 24. There is that ſcattereth and yet encreaſeth, i. e.</hi> One ſort of <hi>ſcatterers</hi> there is that <hi>encreaſeth</hi> by ſcattering; and no cauſe of doubt but that the <hi>mercifull</hi> is this kind of <hi>ſcatterer;</hi> which farther appeares by the oppoſition in the reſt of the verſe, <hi>There is that with holdeth more then is meete, and it tendeth to poverty.</hi> Aſtrange thing that <hi>ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering</hi> ſhould be a meanes of <hi>encreaſing;</hi> giving, of having; and withholding, of poverty; keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of not having; but when 'tis conſidered how all temporall plenty is of Gods diſpoſing, how by his bleſſing and <hi>opening his hand, all things are filled with plenteouſneſſe;</hi> and by his with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing his auſpicious influence, all things are improſperous, moulter and crumble into nothing, there will be ſmall difficulty in beleiving Gods promiſe for ſuch kind of difficulties, as theſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the following verſes make it cleare, that it belongs to this matter, <hi>v. 25. The liberall ſoule ſhall be made fat,</hi> and he <hi>that watereth ſhall be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered alſo himſelfe.</hi> And <hi>ſelling of corne</hi> being an
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:61219:128"/>
act of liberality, <hi>v.</hi> 26. in oppoſition to him that <hi>withholdeth it,</hi> it followes, <hi>Bleſſing ſhall be upon his head.</hi> and <hi>v. 28. The Righteous, i. e.</hi> the liberall againe, (as oppoſite to him that truſteth in riches) <hi>ſhall flouriſh as a branch. i. e.</hi> be very proſperous. And though it follow in the laſt verſe, <hi>that the righteous ſhall be recompenced on the earth; i. e.</hi> meete with afflictions and puniſhments here; ſet is that common ſtate of good men reconcileable with temporall bleſſings here, as may appeare, <hi>Mark.</hi> 10. 30. So againe, <hi>Prov. 13. 22. A good man leaveth his inheritance to his childrens chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> Where if the <hi>good man</hi> be the ſame that is meant by that phraſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 7. it will be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly pertinent to this matter, (and ſo the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text would inforce, <hi>and the wealth of the ſinner is laid up for the juſt.)</hi> But if it be a more generall word, yet then alſo this of the <hi>mercifull</hi> will be <hi>conteined</hi> under it. So againe, <hi>Prov. 14. 21. He that hath mercy on the poore happy is he.</hi> So 19. 17. <hi>He that hath pity on the poore lendeth unto the Lord:</hi> the <hi>Vulgar</hi> read it <hi>[lendeth unto the Lord upon uſe] and that which he hath given will he pay him againe,</hi> and (it being lent upon <hi>uſe,)</hi> pay him with <hi>uſe,</hi> and intereſt alſo. On occaſion of which place I remember an ancient ſtory in <hi>Cedrenus</hi> (how true I know not) of a <hi>Jew,</hi> as ancient, ſaith he, as King <hi>Hezechiahs</hi> time, that having read this place and weighed it, reſolved to try
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:61219:128"/>
whether God would be as good as his word. Gave all that he had but two peices of ſilver, to the poore, and then waited and expected to ſee it come againe; but being not preſently anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in that expectation, grew angry, and went up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to expoſtulate with God for cheating him by this unperformed promiſe. The ſtory goes on, that he being on his way, found two men a ſtriving, engaged in an unreconcilea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble quarrell; about a ſtone, that both, walking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, had found in the way, and ſo had both e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall right to it; but being but one and undivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, could not both enjoy; and therefore to make them freinds, he having two peices of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, doth upon contract divide them betwixt the pretenders, and hath the ſtone in exchange from them; having it, he goes on his journey, and coming to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> ſhewes it the Goldſmith, who tells him that it was a jewell of great value, being a ſtone falne and loſt out of the high Preiſts <hi>Ephod,</hi> to whom if he carried it he ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly receive a great reward; he did ſo, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly it proved; the high Preiſt tooke it of him, gave him a great reward, but withall a box on the eare, bidding him truſt God the next time. The ſtory if true, is an inſtance of the matter in hand; if not, yet an embleme or picture of it. So againe, <hi>Prov. 22. 9. He that hath a bountifull eye ſhall be bleſſed, for he giveth of his bread to the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:61219:129"/>
poore.</hi> Where the affirmative promiſe is moſt punctuall, and the reaſon to confirme it moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable, being but the repetition of the thing it ſelfe, (as principles are faine to be proved by themſelves) the <hi>bountifull</hi> minded man ſhall be bleſſed, why? becauſe he is <hi>bountifull, i. e.</hi> no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther argument needfull to prove it but this; the promiſe, infallible promiſe belonging peculiarly to ſuch. And <hi>Prov. 28. 27. He that giveth to the poore ſhall not lacke.</hi> A moſt definitive large rule, from whence no exception is imaginable, if we had but faith to depend upon it. And leſt you ſhould thinke that this referred onely to the ſtate of the <hi>Iewes</hi> under the Old Teſtament, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed not at all to us Chriſtians, you may <hi>firſt</hi> obſerve, that theſe Proverbs of <hi>Solomon</hi> are not truths peculiar to that ſtate, but extenſive even to us Chriſtians; and more purely ſo, then to them, many of them. 2. That in the Goſpell one place there is that repeates in ſence one part of theſe places, that of 19. 17. <hi>[He that giveth to the poore lendeth to the Lord.]</hi> to wit, <hi>Mat. 25. 43. [In as much as ye did it to one of theſe, you did it unto me.]</hi> And then why may not the latter part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to us alſo? 3. One plaine promiſe of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things there is in the Goſpell alſo to thoſe that part with any of their goods for Chriſts ſake, (and ſuch ſure are the Chriſtian <hi>Almes-givers</hi> that doe it in obedience to Chriſts law, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

               <p>This great duty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of theſe ſo many parts, muſt be performed <hi>frequently</hi> by all and every Chriſtian, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſlacking or intermitting of it; but how fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently there is no precept in this place or any other of ſcripture; which argues that though the ſubſtance of the duty be under particular precept, yet the <hi>frequency</hi> is left (after the manner of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther free-will-offerings) to every mans owne conſcience, and prudence, as occaſions and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ſhall direct. Yet from the commands and examples of Scripture, ſome ſpeciall directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we may take with us. As 1. that <hi>one day in ſeven</hi> is to be ſet apart for this purpoſe, (though not to be all ſpent in the performance of this one duty, yet) for this duty to be carefully perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both in the Church, the familie, and in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate; and that with more ſolemnity then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. 2. That <hi>other times</hi> taken notice of by <hi>the Church,</hi> either by way of commemoration of partticular paſſages in the ſtory of Chriſt, of his Saints, &amp;c. or by way of commemoration of ſome notable benefits received; or on occaſion of particular urgencies, &amp;c. be by us ſolemnely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved alſo, according to the rule of the Church wherein we live; in like manner as the Jewes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved their dayes appointed them by law. 3. that no man omit to performe this duty at leaſt <hi>morning and evening,</hi> every day; this being ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:61219:135"/>
required of the people of God, directed by the law of piety to begin and cloſe all with prayer, which the very heathens could judge neceſſary, and being the leaſt, that can be meant by that precept of the Apoſtle of <hi>praying without ceaſing, or continually:</hi> which is thought by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to extend no farther then in proportion to the dayly ſacrifices among the <hi>Jewes,</hi> which were conſtantly every morning and evening; but by none interpreted, or conceived interpretable to any lower proportion. But then 4. the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of holy men in ſcripture do adde unto this number, ſome more, ſome leſſe: <hi>David</hi> in one place ſpecifies the addition of a third, at <hi>morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and at evening, and at noone day will I pray, and that inſtantly, i. e.</hi> in a ſet, ſolemne, intenſe, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt addreſſe, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 55. 17.

And there is little doubt, but that the <hi>third houre, i. e.</hi> nine in the morning, was an houre of prayer alſo, though there falls not out to be any
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:61219:136"/>
mention of it in the new Teſtament, and then that is a <hi>fifth</hi> time: And the evening prayer being anſwerable to the morning, and ſo uſed at ſix in the evening, as the other at ſix in the morning, the cuſtome of Godly men hath beene to ſhut up the evening with a <hi>Compline</hi> or prayer at nine of the Night, and ſo that is a ſixth time.

               <p>In this there are two queſtions couch ed; 1. whether any <hi>ſet forme of prayer</hi> be lawfull to be uſed? 2. <hi>If it be, whether any other may be uſed?

That it is lawfull to uſe a <hi>ſet</hi> determinate forme of words either written or faſtened in our memory, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent both by the example of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (who in Saint <hi>Luke</hi> bids us when <hi>we pray, ſay, Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c:</hi> not only pray after this patern (as the words in Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> may be interpreted) but uſe theſe very words, <hi>When you pray ſay, Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c. Luk.</hi> 11. 2.) and of <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> who <hi>taught his Diſoiples to pray</hi> in ſome forme, though we know not what it is, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 1. As alſo of the Preiſts that uſed ſet formes of <hi>bleſſing the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Numb.</hi> 6. 24. and of our Saviour himſelfe, who uſed a part (if not the whole) of the 22
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:61219:137"/>
                  <hi>Pſalme</hi> upon the croſſe; <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? &amp;c.</hi> And of the Church of the Jewes, and Chriſtian Churches through all times, who have had their <hi>Liturgies</hi> as wayes and formes of ſerving of God publickely, and as meanes to preſerve the true Religion from all corruptions in doctrine. And to theſe arguments may be added one more of common obſervation even when the Miniſter (or who ever is the mouth of the reſt) prayeth, though in a forme of his owne preſent extemporary effuſion, yet at that time all others preſent are <hi>limited</hi> to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, and pray in as <hi>ſtinted a forme,</hi> as if what the Miniſter prayes were read out of a booke, or dictated by his memory. That it is alſo lawfull to uſe a <hi>ſet</hi> (as that ſignifies a <hi>preſcribed) forme</hi> of prayer is apparent alſo, 1.

               <p>Yes doubtleſſe, For the Church being obeyed in the obſervance of the preſcribed Liturgy in publike, gives liberty for other; ſometimes in the publicke Congregation, ſo it be done prudently and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and reverently, and to edification; and ſo alſo in the family, or in viſitation of the ſicke, if the particular condition of one or other doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it. And in private in the cloſet, 'tis not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by our Church but that every one may aske his owne wants in what forme of words he ſhall thinke fit; which that he may doe fitly and

reverently, 'twill not be amiſſe for him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint himſelfe with the ſeverall ſorts of addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to God, that the Booke of Pſalmes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of Holy Writ, and all other helpes of devotion will afford him, either to uſe as he finds them fit for the preſent purpoſe, or by thoſe pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes to direct and prepare himſelfe to doe the like.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Three ſorts of qualifications: <hi>One</hi> in the perſon that prayeth; and that is, that <hi>he lift up cleane hands without wrath or doubting,</hi> 1. That he be purified from all wilfull ſinne, bring not any unmortified wickedneſſe with him for God to patronize. 2. That he have <hi>charity</hi> to his brethren, and <hi>humility;</hi> the two contraries to wrath. 3. That he come with confidence to Gods Throne, aſſuredly beleiving that if he aske what he ought, and what God hath not decreed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, God will grant it him either in kinde, or by giving him that which is better for him. For this a Chriſtian is bound to beleive, that God is the <hi>hearer of prayers;</hi> that they which <hi>aske ſhall have;</hi> onely this with theſe limitations, unleſſe God by his all-ſeeing eye judge ſomewhat elſe better for us; or by ſome particular decree hath determined the contrary; as when the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a nation is determined, then <hi>though</hi> Noah,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:61219:138"/>

That the <hi>matter</hi> of it be juſtifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; ſuch things as God hath promiſed to give his Children; Or when that is doubtfull whether it be ſuch or no, then with ſubmiſſion to his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as well as his will; if he ſeeth it beſt for us, and not otherwiſe. 2. That the things that <hi>belong to our ſoules,</hi> and wherein God may moſt be honoured, and our neighbour benefited, be moſt and primarily deſired. 3. <hi>Zeale</hi> or ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. 4. <hi>Attention,</hi> as it is contrary to wandring idle thoughts; which (though they are very apt ſtill to interpoſe, and no hope ever to be wholly without them) yet muſt be laboured againſt, and by the uſe of all meanes probable repelled, and pardon for them asked ſolemnely of God. 5. Conſtancy, and perſeverance in asking, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us by the parable of the importunate widow. 6. The uſe of ſuch <hi>bodily reverence,</hi> ſuch geſtures and poſtures as may both helpe to inflame our zeale, and be a fit companion of our ſpirituall worſhip. And 7. ſometimes adding to <note place="margin">Gen. 28. 20.</note> our prayers <hi>vowes</hi> of voluntary oblations, after the example of <hi>Jacob</hi> If <hi>God.</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Thoſe that are to follow our prayers. 1. Obſervation of Gods returnes to our prayers; and in that of
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:61219:139"/>
God's gracious providence in denying what would have beene leſſe fit, and granting that that is more; 2. Returning him the thankes and the glory of all his grants, and denialls. 3. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering and ſetting a value on this great unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell'd dignity and prerogative of a Chriſtian, in talking, and converſing, and prevailing with God; no difficulty of acceſſe, no doubt of accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. 4. Rayſing from his mercies a ſtocke and treaſure of confidence for the future, together with a love of him; and by his denyalls learning to make fitter addreſſes the next time. 5. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing our gratitude for his mercies by our acts of charity and bounty to our brethren that aske of us, or need our ayd, and in caſe of precedent vow, paying that which we have vowed.</p>

withall, becauſe both <hi>David</hi> in his <hi>Pſalmes</hi> (particularly <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136.) and <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his <hi>agony</hi> uſed the ſame words in prayer many times.

That the thing moſt probably to be fixt on, is this, the Tumbling out of a many unſignificant words, as the heathen Tragedies expreſſe their manner, or the ſame words over and over againe, not out of fervency of minde, but to lengthen out the prayer as long as they can, counting this length of words a good quality, or that that makes it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more powerfull or more acceptable with God, which indeed was the peculiar fault of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the Jewes rather uſing conciſeneſſe and brevity in their prayers. From all which it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, that the bare length of prayers, any farther then either the neceſſity of our ſeverall wants, or the fervency of our Zeale requires, or may tend to the inflameing of our Zeale, is not acceptable to God or like to prevaile with him; but rather to do the contrary, if it be affected by us, which is farther evidenced by the manner of that prayer which is here by <hi>Chriſt</hi> commended to us, as a patterne and forme of ours to be ruled and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by. <hi>Our Father &amp;c.</hi> a very conciſe and ſhort prayer. <note place="margin">Of the Lords Prayer.</note>

               <p>Yes, this one thing, that our firſt and cheife care ought to be the glory of God, advancement of his kingdome, and obedience to his will; <hi>i. e.</hi> the ſetting up God in that excellence that belongs to him; which is the ſumme of the three firſt petitions: And then after that, the care of our ſelves and thoſe things wherein we are moſt concerned; the ſumme of the three latter. To which if we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex the Doxology <hi>[for thine is the Kingdome</hi> &amp;c.] which is the reflecting on God's gloryagain the obſervation will be enlarged, that the <hi>glory of God</hi> &amp;c: ought to be our <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>laſt</hi> care; and all that is good to our ſelves taken in only as it may beſt conſiſt with that, on each ſide limited with it; Juſt as we read of the Liturgy uſed by the <hi>Jewes,</hi> that of the eighteen prayers uſed in it, the three firſt and three laſt concerned <hi>God;</hi> and the reſt, betweene <hi>themſelves</hi> and their owne wants.

there is reaſon to thinke that they came in out of the Liturgies of the <hi>Greeke</hi> Church; where (as now in many places) the cuſtome was, when the Lords prayer had beene recited by the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, for the people to anſwer by way of <hi>Dox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology</hi> (as after the reading of every Pſalme a <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry be to the Father, &amp;c.)

That all the acts of a <hi>father</hi> on earth are by him performed to us, but in a farre higher and more excellent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; as farre as <hi>heaven</hi> is above earth. Such are, 1. <hi>His begetting us a new to a lively hope; i. e.</hi> his giving us his ſpirit, the principle of ſpirituall and celeſtiall life: 2.

               <p>This, that whether it were delivered by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or annexed out of the Liturgies of the antient <hi>Greeke</hi> Church, it is a very fit forme of acknowledgement to God to enforce the granting of the petitions; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially thoſe three which reſpect God; thus, <hi>[Thy kingdome come]</hi> for <hi>[thine is the Kingdom.] [Thy will be done]</hi> for <hi>[thine is the power.] [Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed be thy name]</hi> for <hi>[thine is the glory] for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and ever.</hi> The firſt of theſe is the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of God's dominion due to him over the world; and is not (nor can be) ſaid in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt by any, but thoſe that freely reſigne up their ſoules for him alone to reigne in, The ſole Prince and Monarch of their ſoules: He that retaines one <hi>rebell</hi> luſt out of his obedience, doth mock him when he repeates thoſe words. The ſecond is the acknowledgement of Gods omnipotence, and all-ſufficiency, the fountaine of all that grace and ſtrength we beg for; and he that cannot rely on him for all that is neceſſary for this life and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, doth reproach him when he faith <hi>Thine is the power.</hi> The third acknowledgeth the thanks, the honour, the glory, of all we are, or have, to be due to him from whom all is receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he that can impute any thing to himſelfe, as his owne acquiſition, can never be thought in carneſt when he faith <hi>[Thine is the glory.]</hi> The

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>It is a returning by way of reveiw, or giving a reaſon of one paſſage in the former prayer (and but one, as if that were the moſt hugely important of any) to wit why thoſe words <hi>[as we forgive them that treſpaſſe againſt us]</hi> were interpoſed. Namely becauſe in God's forgiving of us, he hath a peculiar reſpect to our free par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don &amp; forgiving of other men; as appeares by the parable. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 35. where he that had his <hi>debt forgiven</hi> him by the King, yet going out and <hi>challenging</hi> his fellow ſervant and <hi>exacting</hi> pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from him, hath the former forgiven debt moſt ſadly brought upon him againe and this applyed there <hi>v.</hi> 35. particularly by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:61219:148"/>
every of us who <hi>from our hearts forgive not our brothren their treſpaſſes.</hi> And therefore whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prayeth for forgiveneſ,ſe in this prayer, doth not only oblige himſelfe to forgive all others, but even curſe and bring downe imprecations upon himſelfe, and deſire God in effect never to pardon him, if he be not thus qualified by pardoning of others. 'Twill therefore be moſt abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for every man, that takes this prayer into his <hi>mouth, firſt</hi> to put all malice, deſire of revenge or grudge out of his <hi>heart;</hi> or elſe his prayer ſhall be truned into a curſe to him.</p>

And the <hi>ſobriety</hi> contrary to this, is when we content our ſelves with that meate and drinke which is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary or uſefull to the health and ſtrength of our bodies, and neglect or deſpiſe all other delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Some difference there is in this matter. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of thoſe <hi>exceſſes</hi> is ſo forbidden, that he that uſeth it is <hi>excluded from the Kingdome of God, 1 Cor. 6. 10. Gal.</hi> 5. 21. And conſequently the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>ſobriety</hi> ſtrictly commanded under that heavy penalty.

Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe two conſiderations there are which make this <hi>exceſſe</hi> in the <hi>quality</hi> or delicacy to be una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the compoſition of the <hi>Gospell-rule of life,</hi> I cannot but ſay that this kind of <hi>ſobriety</hi> is

commanded alſo, and the contrary habit to it a <hi>finne.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>What be thoſe two conſiderations?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>1. The hope of eternall life, and endleſſe ſpirituall joies that are propoſed to us in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which if they be ever ſuffered to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and fill our hearts, will produce a diſ-eſteeme and meane opinion, and in time a contempt and ſcorne of all carnall delights and pleaſures; an <hi>uſing</hi> (the pleaſant part, as well as the profitable of) the <hi>world, as if we uſed it not;</hi> and, ſo we may have <hi>food convenient</hi> for us, a notcaring for any choice or ſuperfluity; an abſteining purpoſely from all ſupervacaneous pleaſure. The ſecond <hi>conſideration</hi> is the duty of charity and liberality to our poore brethren required of us, and ſo recommended to us in the Goſpell: in which he that <hi>fares deliciouſly,</hi> and takes care not onely for the preſerving of the health and ſtrength, but alſo for the pleaſing and entertaining of his palate, will be leſſe able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge his duty; that ſupervacaneous pleaſure bringing a ſuperfluous expence and charge along with it. Theſe two <hi>conſiderations</hi> make it very hardly ſeperable from ſinne, for any man to allow himſelfe this 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> kind of <hi>exceſſe;</hi> though I ſhall not pronounce damnation on him that is guilty of it; 1. Becauſe I doe not find in the New Teſtament a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular direct immediate command againſt it; 2. Becauſe the virtue of <hi>ſobriety,</hi> eſpecially in this 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> ſort conſiſts not in any one point indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:61219:151"/>
ſo that he that eateth this kind of meate ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not, and he that eateth any more delicious doth ſinne. 3. Becauſe there is no rule by which to define <hi>delicious</hi> meates; that being moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to one, which is leſſe to another. 4. Becauſe indeed to a temperate healthy man the plaineſt and ordinarieſt meates are moſt <hi>delightfull and pleaſing</hi> alſo. On which and the like reaſons I ſhall not condemne or terrify any man in this matter, nor tell him the abſteining from delicacies is by any <hi>precept required</hi> of him. But onely mention to him theſe ſeven things. 1. That 'tis a <hi>vile and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n-Chriſtian</hi> thing to ſet the heart upon ſuch meane carnall delights. 2. That what I can convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpare from my ſelfe, I ſhould <hi>reſerve</hi> for thoſe that doe, or may <hi>want</hi> it. 3. That there is <hi>exceſſe in the quality</hi> as well <hi>as quantity</hi> of meates and drinkes. 4. That a Chriſtian may doe better to <hi>deny himſelfe</hi> lawfull pleaſures, then doe all that is not unlawfull. 5. That the <hi>end</hi> of eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king is the <hi>preſervation</hi> of health and ſtrength; and not the <hi>delighting</hi> the palate. 6. That though a well-tempered healthy mans appetite ordinarily demands thoſe things that are fitteſt for him; and conſequently in that caſe the ſatisfying the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite may not be amiſſe; Yet 1. The <hi>appetite</hi> is oft <hi>intemperate</hi> in it's demands; oft demandeth this or that which by ſome <hi>cuſtome</hi> it hath beene uſed to; and then that <hi>cuſtome</hi> being <hi>equivalent</hi> to a
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:61219:151"/>
                  <hi>diſeaſe</hi> ſometimes, ſometimes the <hi>author</hi> of ſome reall diſeaſe, that <hi>diſeaſe</hi> ſhould be cured, and that appetite meane time not obeyed; 2. The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite is tempted many times by the object, either really preſent, being ſet before us; or imaginari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, being repreſented by the phanſy, and then the motion of the appetite is no argument of the meeteneſſe of ſatisfying it. 7. That <hi>faſting,</hi> or abſtinence wholly, is alſo a Chriſtian duty to be uſed ſometimes; and by theſe rules I ſhall leave a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prudent and ſincere Chriſtian to direct him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in this matter, and deſire him in the feare of God to be carefull that he offend not againſt that Chriſtian neceſſary duty of <hi>ſobriety</hi> in any kind.</p>

               <p>I have yet one objection againſt all which you have ſaid in this matter, and it is this, that all this while you have not mentioned any command or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of faſting in the new Teſtament, and therefore do I not beleive there is any ſuch; and for the old Teſtament, though there be a command for the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the great day of expiation every yeare, yet 1. That was onely obligatory to the <hi>Jewes.</hi> 2. It was a publicke faſt, and not pertinent to this place, which ſpeakes of private faſts, 3. If it ſhould be thought to concerne us, yet being but once in the yeare, it would not be conſiderable; from all which it being ſuppoſed that there is no <hi>precept</hi> now par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly obligeing us Chriſtian's to faſt, it may
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:61219:154"/>
ſeeme to follow, that faſting is not now acceptable to God.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>To your whole objection I anſwer, 1. That there is no neceſſity of a precept of faſting, to aſſure us that it will be acceptable to God; there was no precept for <hi>voluntary oblations</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law (ſave only a direction when they were offer'd, that they ſhould not be offered <hi>maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed &amp;c.</hi> as here there is, that we ſhould not ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh our faſting with deſire of <hi>praiſe of men,)</hi> and yet they were accepted; and many other eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have beene produced to prove the uſe of faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be acceptable to God, though not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. 2. Though there be no explicite com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of faſting in the new Teſtament, yet from the nature and conſtitution of the Goſpell, it may be collected, that there are in ſome caſes ſome ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite commands of it. As when all degrees of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe, all ſatisfying the deſires of the fleſh, are forbidden, ſave onely in lawfull matrimonie, and no allowance of polygamy or concubines, to him that findes himſelfe unable thus to live in conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall chaſtity, the uſing of meanes, which may helpe to it, are tacitely commanded by God; and conſequently faſting, if that be the onely meanes left him; and then, as to the Diſciples, that could not caſt out that Devill, which would not goe out but by <hi>prayer and faſting,</hi> it is accounted infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> not to uſe that meanes, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9. 19. So will it be the like unchriſtian ſinne in him, that
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:61219:155"/>
uſes not this meanes ſo neceſſary to ſo neceſſary an end. The ſame may be ſaid, in caſe the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate under whom we live preſcribes the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, or when ever any man ſeeth it neceſſary, or very probable, that he ſhall be hindred from the performing of ſome duty (which he owes to the glory of God or edification of his brethren) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he faſt that day. Laſtly, the caſe may be ſo ſet, that a man may diſcerne himſelfe able, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any detriment to his health, or danger of ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his life, &amp;c. to uſe frequent faſting, and withall by that meanes much advance his ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ends, have greater vacancy for holy imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, greater ſtore for workes of mercy, &amp;c. and then ſure in this caſe the commands of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and mercifullneſſe, will be alſo tacite com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of faſting. So that though there be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular explicite precept, obligeing every man whatſoever, under paine of ſinne to faſt ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, thus, or thus often; yet <hi>tacite</hi> commands there may be to them that are by any of theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances fitted for it; and even to thoſe that for the preſent are not, it will yet be fit to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and counted of, as a duty that they may be concerned in; and that, if in no other reſpect, yet in this, that they are Chriſtians who aſpire to an angelicall life, and inviſible joyes, and ſhould therefore deny, and by that weane themſelves of thoſe ſenſuall corporeall pleaſures of eating, or

That the <hi>Phariſee faſted twice every weeke,</hi> and that never cenſured in him as a peice of Phariſaiſme, or hypocriſie, or fault of any kind; but as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, if he had not boaſted of it. 2. That every Chriſtian ought to have his ſolemne <hi>ſet dayes</hi> for the performing that great and weighty duty of <hi>humiliation,</hi> in calling himſelfe to account for all his wayes, and confeſſing his ſinnes to God more particularly; and thoſe dayes ſhould not be too ſlow in their returnes, leſt his ſoule be too deep in arreares, and ſo unwilling to come to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts at all. 'Tis very reaſonable for every man or woman of leiſure to ſet apart <hi>one day in the weeke</hi> for this turn; &amp; if the whole day or any other part of it may not thus be ſpared from the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his calling, yet the dinner time that day may be borrowed from eating, and thus more uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully emploied, without any diſturbance to his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:61219:156"/>
affaires. And he that uſeth not ſome ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant courſe (which yet on ſpeciall occaſions may be altered) will be in great danger to be found, and cenſured a neglecter of the duties of a Diſciple of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> 3. That over and above this common du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all men, ſome other wants there are or may be in this or that man, to the repairing of which faſting may be very inſtrumentall, as hath beene ſhewed; and ſo proportionably is to be more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently uſed by them who have this need of it Of which their owne conſcience in the feare of God is left the judge. All this hath beene ſaid of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate faſting, becauſe that is peculiar to this place. For <hi>publicke faſting</hi> the direction muſt be had from the lawes where we live; which ſo farre at leaſt oblige every one that he offend not againſt them, either contemptuouſly, or with ſcandall.</p>

And by this way of ſtating, I acknowledge our Saviours ſpeech here fully reconciled with Saint</hi> Pauls <hi>command of providence, with</hi> Chriſts <hi>praying for temporall bleſſings, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>

ſatisfaction, whether God doth not ſometimes leave men deſtitute of food and rayment, and how then it can be infidelity to be anxious in that point? Or how can Gods promiſe of caring for us be ſaid to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I anſwer, 1. That it is not ordinary for men to be left deſtitute of food and rayment; and though ſometime it cannot be had but by begging of it, yet God having in his providence deſigned the rich man to be his ſteward, the <hi>weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy mans barne to be the poore mans ſtore-houſe;</hi> no man is left deſtitute that is afforded this meanes. 2. There being ſo many other meanes forenamed, required of us, to be inſtrumentall to Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, it will hardly be found that any man is left thus deſtitute, who hath not firſt beene wanting to himſelfe; and ſo the whole matter imputable to his default, and not to Gods. 3. That if the utmoſt be ſuppoſed which is imaginable, that ſome one be left ſo farre deſtitute as to come to ſtarve, yet may the promiſe of God remaine true and firme; for that promiſe obligeth him not to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize the life of any, which being ſuppoſed, that he ſhould dye by famine, is as reaſonable and reconcileable with this promiſe, (which can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend no farther then that he will ſuſteine us, as long as he ſees it fit for us to live, but no longer) as that he ſhould dye by ſword, or peſtilence; and that death as ſupportable as many other diſeaſes and deaths, of the ſtone, ſtrangury, dyſentery, &amp;c.
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:61219:167"/>
4. That ſuppoſe God doe thus deſtitute us, yet our anxiety, or ſollicitude, our uſing of unlawfull meanes, can never be able to releive or ſecure us; whatſoever we can in this caſe call to our releife, God can curſe and blaſt alſo, and make it as unable to helpe us, as the reed of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> and though ſometimes God permits unlawfull meanes to offer us helpe, when lawfull faile us, to make triall of us whether we will uſe them, and diſtruſt God or no, (who ought to be <hi>truſted</hi> and relied on, <hi>though he kill us)</hi> yet is it farre more ordinary for thoſe who have fled to all manner of diſhoneſt meanes of encreaſing wealth, to come to abſolute beggery and diſtreſſe, and contumelious ends; then in any mans obſervation it will be found for the truſters in God to doe. 5. Why may it not be thought and found true upon every mans ſelfe-examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that ſuch deſtitution, when ever it befalls a child of Gods, is a puniſhment of ſome ſinne which God in mercy ſees fit to puniſh here, and not in another world. As particularly that of <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſſe of Faith</hi> in this matter, (as <hi>Peters ſinking, Mat.</hi> 14. 30. was a puniſhment of his <hi>feare, and doubting, and little Faith;</hi> which ſome good men <note place="margin">

               <p>I conceive you have now done with the precept or doctrine, which now I ſee how fitly it is annexed to the former matter of not ſerving of Mammon. 1. As an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the <hi>Mammoniſts</hi> reaſon of ſerving <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> that he may not be deſtitute the morrow, 2. As an improvement of that exhortation to which it may be ſeaſonably ſuperadded, but would never have entered or have beene admitted without that harbenger. I beſeech God to ſinke it now unto my heart! To which end I preſume you will give me your aſſiſtance by proceeding to the <hi>ſecond</hi> thing propoſed from our ſaviours words here, the <hi>Inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of it,</hi> ſhewing how reaſonable it is to be a ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by a Chriſtian?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I ſhall proceed to that, and give you the inforcements as they lie. A firſt inforcement is the conſideration of what God hath done to us allready. 1. He hath given us <hi>life</hi> it ſelfe, which is much more, and a farre greater act of power and mercy then to give <hi>food</hi> for the continuing of that life. 2. Given us the very <hi>body</hi> we take ſuch care of, and that much more againe then the <hi>rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> that muſt cloth it, and thoſe he hath given without any aide of ours, without our uſe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:61219:169"/>
or indirect meanes, and therefore no doubt can provide ſufficiently for the ſuſteining of both, and for his willingneſſe to do it, if we truſt and rely on him, thoſe very former mercies of his are pawnes and pledges of it. <hi>God</hi> (ſaith a father) <note place="margin">Deus donan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do debet Cypr.</note> 
                  <hi>by giving becomes our debtor.</hi> Every mercyfrom ſo good a father, comes forth twins; a <hi>gift;</hi> and a <hi>bond</hi> together; a preſent <hi>payment,</hi> and a future <hi>pawne;</hi> a <hi>ſumme</hi> payed downe, and an <hi>annuity</hi> made over, the having beſtowed favours, the greateſt obligations to continue them, when we can begin with the Pſalmiſt <hi>Pſ. 100. It is he that made us,</hi> then we may as confidently go on, <hi>we are his people and ſheep. &amp;c.</hi> and then, <hi>O go your way into his gates with thanksgiving,</hi> not only for paſt mercies but confidence of future alſo, <hi>his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is everlaſting, &amp;c.</hi> A ſecond inforcement is taken from the example of God's providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward other creatures 1. For <hi>food,</hi> from the <hi>foules of the aire,</hi> 2. For <hi>rayment</hi> from the <hi>lillies of the field.</hi> For food, that thoſe birds without any trade of husbandry, of ſowing or reaping, &amp;c. are by the providence of God ſufficiently ſuſtein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. (Nay of many birds it is obſerved they are fatteſt ſtill in coldeſt and ſharpeſt weather.) Nay that ſort of birds, that Saint <hi>Luke</hi> mentions. <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 24. the <hi>ravens</hi> are a creature that if <hi>Job</hi> or the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> may be beleived <hi>Job</hi> 38. 41. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 147. 9. hath more of the providence of God illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:61219:169"/>
in it then any other. Naturaliſts have obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of that creature, that it <hi>expoſeth the young ones</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Valleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</note> And therefore perhaps it was, that that creature to make its returne of gratitude to God, flies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently on its errand to feed the prophet <hi>elias</hi> in the wilderneſſe; in which this was ſurely very obſervable, that that creature which is ſo unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall as not to feed its owne young ones, did yet at God's command feed the prophet. As ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thoſe baggs of the miſer are opened liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Gods children, (at their death in building hoſpitalls &amp;c.) which had beene ſhut to their owne all their life. This example our Saviour ſhuts up with an expoſtulation, <hi>[are not you much better then they?]</hi> Man a much more conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creature then thoſe birds, man the Monarch of all them, and <hi>the life of my Lord the</hi> King <hi>worth ten thouſand of theirs,</hi> and therefore ſurely a farre greater part of God's providence, then they, though no thoughtfulneſſe of his contribute to it.

But then this muſt be taken with ſome caution along with it; not that we ſhould neither ſow, nor reape, becauſe the foules do neither; but that we ſhould take no anxious thought, as <note place="margin">

Had men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired but as much religion, dependance, truſt, reliance on God by all the preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, by all the cultivation of ſo many hundred yeares, as nature teacheth the young <hi>ravens,</hi> as ſoone as they are hatcht, to gape toward heaven, and ſo in a plaine, downeright, naturall, inarticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late way, to <hi>call on God,</hi> the <hi>Mammoniſts</hi> idoll would ſoone be driven out of the world; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of it, a cheerefull comfortable dependance on heaven (in deſpight of all our jealous traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous feares, that worldly hearts betray us to) an obedient ſubmiſſion to Gods direction in uſing thoſe meanes that he directeth us; and then reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all up into his hands to diſpoſe of, with an <hi>[If I periſh I periſh]</hi> and <hi>[I will waite upon the Lord which hideth his face, and I will looke for him]</hi> and <hi>[though he kill me yet will I truſt in him.]</hi> The other example concerning <hi>rayment from the lillies of the field</hi> lies thus. God in his forming of the world hath beſtowed a ſtrange proportion of

naturall be auty and ornament upon the <hi>lillies</hi> that grow in every field or garden, though thoſe are of a very ſhort duration, and being inanimate do contribute nothing to their owne beauty, but moſt evidently the whole worke wrought by God only, and all the care and ſollicitude and temporall advantages of gold and the like artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall bravery cannot equall or compare with that naturall beauty which God hath endued them with. Which conſideration as it may well leſſen our deſire of the gallantry of clothes, and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our pride which they feed in us (the utmoſt that we can attaine to in this kinde being not comparable with that, which is in the meaneſt creatures) ſo may it give us a fiduciall relyance on God for all things of this nature; who ſure can cloth us; as well as thoſe, and will certainely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for us ſuch rayment, as is convenient for us, by our uſe of ordinary meanes, without our anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous care and ſollicitude for the future.</p>

by that meanes lay a double burthen on that part of our life, which is preſent, to provide for it ſelfe, and that other alſo) will when it cometh, <hi>be able to take care and make proviſion for it ſelfe.</hi> The <hi>Manna,</hi> that came downe from heaven to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> fell every day, and therefore there was no need of laying up in ſtore (and if it were done, it putrified) of reſerving any part of the preſent portion; for, for the time to come they were ſure to be as plentifully provided, as for the preſent they were; and ſo the providence of God that hath brought us in a preſent ſtore, will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ready to do the like for the remainder of our lives, when it comes; and therefore all that we ſhall acquire by this ſollicitude before hand, is only to accumulate trouble, and diſquiet upon our ſelves; beſides that due labour, and induſtry, which we owe to God, as ſubſervient to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and to our ſelves for our preſent ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, ſo much more as will ſecure us for the future alſo; which, what is it but to multiply toyle upon our ſelves, above the proportion that God hath deſigned to us? Whereas the trouble that belongs to every day <hi>for the maintaining of it ſelfe (i. e.</hi> the labour and ſweat that we eate our bread in) is ſufficient for that day, without our artifices to increaſe it, and requires too much (ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then takes up too little) time of divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the duties of piety to theſe ſo vile in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour

               <p>Yes! If that which you judge in him be (though neither habituall, nor incorrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) yet notorious, and evidence of fact make it ſubject to no miſtake of theirs. 2. If you extend that cenſure no farther, then that fact; or no farther

then what may from that fact be neceſſarily infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; 3. If you expreſſe your judgement or cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in words, no farther then may agree with rules of charity; As 1. Charity to him either in telling it him your ſelfe, and ſeaſonably reproving him, or telling it ſome body elſe, to that end that he may reprove him. Or 2. Charity to others, that they may be warned and armed, not to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and enſnared by him; Or 3. Charity to the community, that he may not by concealement of ſome great faults get into ſuch place of judicature &amp;c. where that ravenous humour of his, entring in a diſguiſe of <hi>ſheeps clothing,</hi> may be armed with power to doe more miſchiefe. In all which I muſt be very wary, that under this cloake of charity I doe not carry along a malicious, or proud, or wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, petulant humour of my owne; or even an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of defaming; and flatter my ſelfe that charity is the onely mover in me all this while.</p>

                  <hi>But can my judgement be forced?

               <p>It is this, (occaſioned by the laſt precept of <hi>doing,</hi> as well as <hi>profeſſing Gods will)</hi> that the profeſſion of Chriſtianity lending a patient eare to thoſe doctrines, will, (if it be, (as oft as it is) truſted to and depended on, to render us acceptable to Chriſt) prove a very fallacious, and deceitfull hope. Whenſoever any ſtorme comes, any ſhaking diſeaſe or affliction, which gives us occaſion to awake throughly, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine

'Tis <hi>true Chriſtian pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,</hi> that will hold out in time of triall; and that hope of ours which is thus grounded, will ſtand firme and ſtable in time of affliction, and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at the houre of death, and the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This doctrine of Chriſtian duty and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is ſuch that can never deceive any man that is content to build upon it. Nor <hi>infirmity,</hi> nor <hi>ſin,</hi> (committed, but repented of, and forſaken) nor <hi>Devill,</hi> ſhall ever ſhake any mans hold that is thus built; endanger any mans ſalvation, that lives ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule of this Sermon; nor ſhall all the flattering deceitfull comforters of the world, bring in any true gaine to any other.</p>
