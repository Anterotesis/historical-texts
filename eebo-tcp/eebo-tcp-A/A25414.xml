            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>OUt of the long and continuall love and affection, and alſo in reſpect of your continuall expreſſions of kind<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe and curteſie extended unto me, where by you have obliged me unto a neceſſary gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, I could not neglect my ſervice unto you, whereby you may aſwell taſte of our joy and comfort, as you have formerly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of our jealouſies and fears, juſtly conceived in theſe parts; occaſioned here amongſt us by reaſon of his Majeſties ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and alienation from the Honourable Houſe of Parliament, and by reaſon of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode amongſt us here in theſe Northerne parts: For ſince his Majeſties reſidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, we have had continuall rumours of Civill Warres in this Kingdome, no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe almoſt ſtirring, but what hath poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt the Subjects hearts with feare and terror, by reaſon of the continuall expectation of
<pb facs="tcp:65359:3"/>
blood and miſchief. But now we hope all things are at the worſt, and that the bleſſed Sun of peace and proſperitie, which hath long ſlept under a diſcontented cloud, will break forth, and with its happy and cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full beams, warm the benummed eſtate of this diſtracted State and Kingdome. I may indeed truly call it diſtracted, and diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, when a generall malady had over-run and over-ſpread the whole body, ſo that one continuall grief had diſquieted the Head, and all the members, both Head and members ſuffering a moſt grievous and terrible mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, which daily did beget in all true hearts, the fear and expectation of ruine and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which muſt of neceſſitie enſue the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement of the King and Parliament. I doubt not but you have heard of the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations which have been publiſhed on both ſides, both by his Majeſtie and the Houſes of Parliament, which have taken but ſmall ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſo that the maladie of this Kingdome yet remains unrelieved.</p>
            <p>Upon the ſeventh of June laſt, ſince His Majeſtie gave anſwer unto the laſt Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Houſe of Parliament, his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie
<pb facs="tcp:65359:3"/>
at an Aſſembly of the Peers and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell which were then preſent with him at <hi>York,</hi> declared his laſt intentions unto them, and reſolved them that this his laſt and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute determination, was to ſet up his Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, and that ſince he could not win and perſwade the Houſes of Parliament to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto his deſires, that he would defend himſelf by his ſword, and by that meanes ſecure his Crown and Royall prerogatives; which he ſaid he well underſtood they had an aim and intention to abridge and deprive him of.</p>
            <p>This Reſolution was diverſly received and entertained among the Nobles, ſome being reſolute to hazard all, both their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, lives and fortunes, in this His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Reſolution, and to endeavour by all means to juſtifie his undertakings; Others upon more mature conſultation and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, were of another mind, and thought that by this meanes they could not acquit themſelves of the fidelitie impoſed upon them for the generall good and benefit of the whole Kingdome.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65359:4"/>So that induced by theſe and other faithfull and mature conſiderations, as in duty, and by oath they ſtood bound, they did apply themſelves to divert his Majeſty from this his intention and determination, whereby his Majeſty did perceive his Majeſty might bring a ruine unto this Nation, and alſo that it was impoſſible by this meanes to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect his determined purpoſe without the danger and loſſe of thoſe who were moſt neere and deare unto him, and in whoſe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity his Majeſty did repoſe his truſt and confidence, and alſo out of their loyaltie and care informed his Majeſty, that they feared that thoſe who had poſſeſſed his Majeſties eares and breaſt with this evill and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive counſell, they did very much feare would at the time of moſt hazard and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, be backward and unwilling to put his will in execution. Theſe perſwaſive reaſons could not alter his Majeſties reſolution for the preſent, but he ſeemed to be ſomewhat diſpleaſed with their adviſe; Whereupon ſome of his counſell whoſe hearts and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie ſtood well affected to the State, left his Majeſtie, <hi>viz.</hi> the Earle of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> the Earle
<pb facs="tcp:65359:4"/>
of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Clare,</hi> with one Lord more whoſe name for the preſent I canot remember, took their leave and would have come for <hi>London.</hi> Afterwards Sir <hi>John Banks</hi> endevored to perſwade His Majeſtie to make His return to <hi>London</hi>; Which at firſt ſeemed as pleaſing to his Majeſtie as to the Subject deſirous of this moſt happy union, and it received ſuch welcome entertainment with His Majeſtie, that he was graciouſly pleaſed to prepare himſelf for <hi>London.</hi> This was moſt welcome newes, and gave a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and ample ſatisfaction to all, but thoſe whoſe aimes are the difference between His Majeſtie and the loyall Subject. Much joy was at the firſt conceived and expreſſed, and and in this joy and comfort the night was ſpent. But joy and grief have their continual ſucceſſion, and ſeldome is joy of a long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, for now when the morning vvas come, and the accompliſhment of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived joy vvas expected, a ſuddain cloud overſpread their cheerfull breaſts, and a new diſcontent vvas ſpread through thoſe parts, for His Majeſties reſolution vvas quite alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from what he had over night determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb facs="tcp:65359:5"/>
which did cauſe a generall ſorrow in all true hearts; the cauſe of this ſo ſuddain change, is not as yet made known, but tis ſuppoſed that His Majeſtie was moved thus ſo ſuddainly to alter his reſolution, by the wicked advice of ſome malignant and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſpirits, who are near His Majeſties perſon.</p>
            <p>Thus have I enformed you of the laſt proceedings that have happened amongſt us, God in his good time ſettle all things, that this Nation again may flouriſh: So I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly take my leave, and reſt</p>
