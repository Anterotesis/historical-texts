         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Don Franciſco De Mela,</hi> the Spaniſh Prefect now in Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,

at their owne charge to be ſent into the North of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,

that ſervice would be to his Holineſſe, and the
Conclave at Rome, how advantagious to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Catholicke cauſe, and re-eſtabliſhment of

part of his honour engaged to returne theſe ſouldiers back:
His Majeſty the King of England now he had need of
them, himſelf when he had bin ſo courteouſly permitted to
condiſcend to the Spaniards aſſiſtance, and laſtly, that this
action would not only be unpre judiciall to the league now
in force with England, but rather an additament to cement
it faſter. It being made with the King of England, to whom
the Parliament was refractory, and with open armes
ſought to diminiſh His Royalty, and bring in inſtead of
the Proteſtant Religion (which was leſſe oppoſite to
theirs) Puritaniſme, Browniſme, or Anabaptiſme. So mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

that though he wiſhed as well to the Catholique cauſe as
any, and ought His Majeſty of England as much ſervice as
any forraine Prince whatſoever; yet that he durſt not
without expreſſe command of the King his Maſter, ſend
any of his Frigats to their places, or imploy them to other
uſes, then to the guard of the Flemiſh Coaſt againſt their
inveterate adverſary the Hollanders who, for the alliance
they have to the State of Engl. to which they were enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
would be ſure to interrupt them in their paſſage, that for
the Engliſh Regiments, though they were King <hi>Charles</hi> his
Subjects, they were King <hi>Philips</hi> ſouldiers there, ere hee
came to the government, and that he was reſolv'd to leave
all things in thoſe Provinces as hee found them; that hee
could not with the ſafety of his wiſdome or allegiance to
his Maſters ſervice, dimiſſe ſo many able and experienc'd
ſouldiers, dangers both from neighbouring France, and not
farre diſtant Holland, threatning on every ſide thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
that for the quarrell or contention betweene his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
of great Britaine and his Parliament, as he was uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in it, ſo he was reſolv'd not to intermeddle in other
mens buſineſſe, but to preſerve the league nnviolate, and
for their reverences, the Fathers of the ſociety, purchaſing
amunition to transferre hither, <hi>Don Franciſco</hi> told Father
<hi>Siliſden,</hi> that they might <hi>Con muy buena gana,</hi> with all his

from his great Patrons the aforeſaid Jeſuits, hee made
purchaſe of three good tall barks, (which are very good

without examination from the Hollander, and in them
landed this Ammunition: committing the care thereof,
