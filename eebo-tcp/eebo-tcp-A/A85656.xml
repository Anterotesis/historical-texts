            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is no truth now more apparent, then that the tongues and pens of many men; and the Preſſe have in theſe latter times been ſo looſe and diſordered, as that they have been applied too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to the ſcandalizing of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in Parliament, and the ſeverall Committees, and Members by them imployed, in the tranſacting of the weighty affaires of the Kingdome, during the times of theſe late diſtempers: that ſo they might bring them into the diſaffections of the people. The truth of this
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:160472:3"/>
is clearely proved by thoſe ſeverall <hi>Pamphlets</hi> which every day are engendred, and ſent abroad into the world: and by the cunning and artifice of ſeverall evill diſpoſed perſons, of different tempers, they are made inſtrumentall for different ends and intentions. And this is perceived by all wiſe men, ſo that it is hoped thoſe Libells take no impreſſion with them, in regard of the perſons ſcandalized: And amongſt others finding the Committee of the <hi>Navy</hi> and <hi>Cuſtomes,</hi> as they have had no ſmall part of the care and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of theſe weighty affaires, ſo not to have the leaſt ſhare in thoſe ſcandalls and reproaches: In diſcharge of the duty I owe unto the Parliament, who when the <hi>King</hi> deſerted them, were neceſſitated to undertake the Government of the <hi>Navy</hi> Royall of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, for the ſafety and good thereof, and likewiſe of the Cuſtomes appointed for its maintenance and ſupport, and alſo in diſcharge of that particular duty I owe the Committee of the <hi>Navy</hi> and <hi>Cuſtomes,</hi> and the Gentlemen attending thoſe ſervices, unto whoſe care and truſt both <hi>Houſes of Parliament</hi> committed that great and weighry Charge. And to cleare up the Honour, Care, Prudence, and Fidelity of both <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>Committee,</hi> againſt all Traducers, in the advantagious and faithfull diſcharge of the truſt for the weale and ſafety of the People, and all the three Kingdomes; I thought it not the leaſt part of my duty, (being beſt acquainted with thoſe affairs) to make this following Declaration of the beginning, progreſſe, and preſent State of the ſame; relating to the <hi>Cuſtomes</hi> and <hi>Navy;</hi> and by what Rules they have been trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:160472:3"/>
In the yeare 1641. ſhortly after the <hi>Parliament</hi> firſt ſate, and before the <hi>King</hi> deſerted them, the Houſe of Commons appointed ſome Gentlemen of that Committee, and recommended to their charge the diſcovery of the abuſes of the then Farmors of the Cuſtomes, and the Examination of their Accounts from the firſt yeare of his Majeſties Raigne, unto that time: And notwithſtanding the work was conceived by many worthy Gentlemen not to be feazible, yet that Cmmittee within few Months by their report did ſo ſatisfie the Houſe of the whole State of that affaire, as it produced 176000. in fines to the uſe of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>This done about the 25. of <hi>May</hi> 1641. the Houſe of Commons commanded that Committee to frame a Bill for the legall payment of <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> to continue for a few weeks, untill ſome difficulties and miſunderſtandings between the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were removed; and upon the ſame grounds ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall other ſhort Acts of <hi>Parliament</hi> were paſſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till <hi>Iuly</hi> 1642.</p>
            <p>But the burthens upon Merchandize, both forreign and domeſtick being unequally layd by the old Book of Rates, occaſioned ſeverall complaints and Petitions, from <hi>Merchants, Cloathiers, Shopkeepers,</hi> and others, unto the <hi>Parliament,</hi> for eaſe of thoſe burthens; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon in the yeare 1641. the Houſe ordered that <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee</hi> to frame a new Book of Rates: This proved a work of that travell and conſequence in relation to the ſupport of the trade of the <hi>Kingdome</hi> on the one ſide, and the Revenue of the <hi>Kingdome</hi> for ſupport of the <hi>Navy,</hi> the ſtrength of the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> on the other ſide, as it became full of labour and intricacy to keep
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:160472:4"/>
the Ballance even; for the encreaſe of the one, and ſupport of the other, of which the very bare diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of thoſe Rules which the wiſedome of that <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee</hi> found out to the due framing of that elaborate work, will ſufficiently ſatisfie the Reader at firſt view.</p>
            <p>
               <list>
                  <item>They firſt divided all Merchandize into
Domeſtick and Forreign.</item>
                  <item>Domeſtick into Commodities

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The Manufactures of Wooll, in regard of their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall influence throughout moſt conditions of men, and hazard of the loſſe of that Trade in Forraigne parts ſo much of late undermined by Forraigne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, was much eaſed of its former impoſition.</p>
            <p>The other Staple Commodities as Tyn, Lead, &amp;c. not ſo ſubject to danger as the others, were raiſed to ſome higher Rates, according as the ſame could well beare.</p>
            <p>
               <list>
                  <item>The Forraign Commodities were divided into Neceſſaries. and Superfluities.</item>

            </p>
            <p>Neceſſaries, and of certain uſe, as victualls, and all materialls for to encreaſe the Manufactures of the Kingdome were eaſed.</p>
            <p>Superfluities which might be ſpared, and were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centives to Prodigality, either in apparrall, or diet, food, or rayment, had their full load; ſaving that in

the very ſuperfluities they found it neceſſary to make addifference: As,</p>
            <list>
               <item>Thoſe of bulk, advantagious in the employment of Shipping and Marriners, in that relation, were ſomewhat eaſed.</item>
               <item>Thoſe of ſmall Stowage had a full load laid on them.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Yet in thoſe likewiſe they made a difference: <list>

            </p>
            <p>But the Marchants of the Kingdome not only ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring under the unequall impoſitions laid on their Commodities, but under the Arbitrary power, and undue Fees of the Officers of the Cuſtomes, which oftentimes more oppreſſed them then the payment of the impoſitions themſelves.</p>
            <p>It was not the leaſt labour of that Committee, to diſpoſe of the manner of payment of the duty, and to give ſuch directions therein as by thoſe Rules they delivered the Merchant, from all occaſions of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, by the Officer, and yet kept up the Officer in his due eſteeme.</p>
            <p>In compleating of this great work, the Committee proceeded by a further rule, as well to attaine to the knowledge of the value of all Commodities, as to their uſefulneſſe, without which, they could not well agree on the duty: And to that end did make uſe of the labours and judgements of many Merchants of quality, of known integrity, and beſt experienced in Forraigne Trade, and Importers of the ſeverall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, who having with much labour laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this great work; It was alſo the wiſdome
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:160472:5"/>
of the Committee in ſo high a truſt to take advice from the Retailors, and ſeverall Traders in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Commodities.</p>
            <p>And after divers dayes diſputes with them, having made their obſervations in writing of the differences in opinion between the Importer and Buyer, did referre the whole work together with their own obſervations, unto the Farmours and Officers of the Cuſtomes, who according to their great experience and wiſedome, did contribute much unto the compleating thereof: And upon return of their opinions, the Committee finding yet further differences; did after divers dayes ſpent in conference with the three Parties, <hi>viz.</hi> the Importer, the Buyer, and the Officer, and upon obſervations from them all, appoint a generall meeting of the Merchants, Retailors, and Officers, acquainted them with their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in opinion, which were reduced to very few, conſidering the variety and greatneſſe of the work: And after a deliberate debate with them joyntly, the Committee did compleat that work; and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it to the Houſe of Commons, where it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a generall approbation with very few amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>The Book of Rates thus formed, and upon Report made to the Houſe of Commons thereof, being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and paſſed without a contradicting voyce, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was given for the ſame to be printed and publiſhed; and an Act of Parliament to be drawn for <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> relating to theſe Rates, which with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation of that Committee, and advice with the Kings Councell, learned in the Law, was drawn accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, reported and paſt both Houſes, and ſent to

            </p>
            <p>An imployment of great weight and as great truſt, and which they diſcharged with as much faithfulneſſe, wiſedome, and advantage to the State, the diſtractions of the times, the diſaffections of many Merchants, and the want of a penalty to enjoyn the payment, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as ever that affaire was managed ſithence the Conqueſt; which doth manifeſtly appeare by their ſaving upward of twelve thouſand pound <hi>per Annum,</hi> in the very charge of the Commiſſioners; and reduced unneceſſary Officers, formerly employed in the manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe affaires, and yet encreaſed that Revenue at leaſt one third <hi>per Annum,</hi> in thoſe Ports which were ſtill under the obedience of <hi>Parliament,</hi> beſides the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of thoſe Out-Ports that were regained from the Enemy.</p>

            <p>Beſides, there have ſeverall years been ſet out ſeverall Ships, by private Adventurers by way of reprizall, which have been allowed victuals by the State.</p>
            <p>In all which Expeditions, theſe particular actions of that Committee are remarkable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That being furniſhed with this great power and truſt, in ſetting forth of Ships, providing of materials and payment of moneys, they took along with them the concurrent advice and full conſent of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of the <hi>Navy,</hi> Victulars of the <hi>Navy,</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Ordnance, and all other Officers of the <hi>Navy</hi> reſpectively, as fellow ſervants truſted with them, who by the order and directions of that Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, did with all chearefulneſſe and faithfulneſſe, for any thing that ever appeared unto that Committee, act and execute all things for the greateſt advantage of the State, in relation to the honour, ſafety, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That with their concurrent advice and help, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Yards, &amp; Store-houſes of the <hi>Navy Royal,</hi> were ſo plentifully &amp; ſeaſonably maintained with Pitch, Tarre, Hemp, Cordage, Planck, Timber, and all other materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als for ſhipping: And the Office of Ordnance ſo fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Ordnance, Powder, Shott, &amp; other Gunners
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:160472:7"/>
Stoares, The victualling Office ſo carefully and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagiouſly managed, as that there was not one ſhip of all theſe ſeverall Fleets, but at her ſetting to Sea was compleatly and Arithmetically furniſhed with double Equipage, of Cordage, Sayles, &amp;c. with due proportion of Powder, Match, Bullett, according to the Number and dimenſions of her Ordnance: and with Beef, Pork, Fiſh, Peaſe, Butter, Cheeſe, Bread, Beere, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther victuals, and all of the choyſeſt and beſt, as there was never complaint made to the Parliament or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of any defect of any of theſe, either for quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity or quality.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That comming in of ſhips, (ſaving in the time of the late Commiſſioners of the Cuſtomes, who for ſome reaſons beſt known to themſelves, did refuſe upon preſſing occaſions to furniſh the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or that Committee with money or credit:) The Committee took that care for providing of moneys, (many times with their credit) as the Marriners were ſo timely paid off, that the State was not at the charge of one dayes dead pay, neither was ever complaint of Marriners hard at the doores of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, ſince the time of theſe Commiſſioners.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the whole body of the Navy was kept up, in that honour, ſtrength, and readineſſe for ſervice, as no age can parallel, there being at this preſent an increaſe of above thirty ſhips and Frigats more then they found belonging to the <hi>Navy Royall,</hi> whereof ſome have been taken by reprizall, ſome bought for money, and ſome built from the ſtocks, which are moſt active nimble Veſſels, all now in ſervice.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That this great work was ſo advantagiouſly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on, as notwithſtanding the State was ſometime

               </gap> yet hitherto (ſaving in the time before mentioned) there never wanted monies to carry through all the difficulties of that ſervice.</p>
            <p>Neither was the managing of the Cuſtomes and of the Navy, though two ſuch great workes, the only imployment of that Committee: But in the yeare 1643. the Parliament having by reaſon of the great fleetes contracted great debts on the Navy, were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to put an Exciſe on Fleſh and Salt, the profits whereof they appropriated to the uſe of the Navy, and committed the charge and care thereof to that Committee, by whoſe wiſedome and care, with the concurrence of the Commiſſioners of Exciſe, only by changing the manner of the collection, the yearly income was encreaſed from about ſeven or eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pound, unto near ſixty thouſand pound <hi>per Ann.</hi> as by the Commiſſioners of Excize Accounts will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare; All which monies were diſpoſed of by that Committee by the ſame Rule of Cuſtomes. Beſides, there are ſeverall Gentlemen of this Committee who being with divers honourable Lords, appointed a Committee for the Excize, have tranſacted very great matters concerning the regulating of thoſe Receipts, and reconciling of differences happening in the ſame. There was a further charge lay on that Committee, which was the managing of the ſhips, and goods ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by reprizall, which begot not the leaſt trouble to the Committee, in regard of the many intricare caſes, which fell out, ſcarce numerable, in ſo ſhort a Narrative, yet was that diſtracted work with the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe, care, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

and Collectors appointed for reprizall goods, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on with all advantage as was poſſible for ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy a work to bee managed, which proved much the more troubleſome and intricate, (though the cheifeſt part of that trouble fell to the Collectors) by reaſon owners of Merchants ſhips and all mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners had ſhares in all prizes and prize goods taken; And this is here remarkable, that there is not an owner of ſhipping, nor mariner in the Kingdome that can juſtly complaine, but that he hath received his full payment of all advantages which have been made in this kind, ſaving in ſome caſes of late, only for want of a Iudge of the Admiralty to adjudge the ſame.</p>
            <p>Beyond all this, It is obſerveable, that in the firſt yeare of theſe unhappy diſtractions, ſix of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the Navy with three honourable Lords, did diſcharge the office of the Lord high Admirall, and of the Judge of the Admiralty: and with unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible trouble and care, without the help of the Admiralty Court, the Iudge having deſerted it, did by the order of the Parliament, wade through thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricare caſes which fell out that firſt yeare. Beſides this, ſeverall worthy Gentlemen of that Committee, have for divers years ſince, together with divers ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Lords, for want of a Lord High Admirall, by command of both Houſes, carried on the whole frame of the affaires of the Admiralty and Cinque-ports. There lay yet a further charge on divers Gentlemen of that Committee, in regard of thoſe relations which that Committee had unto all Sea affaires and to trade: It pleaſed the Parliament to joyne them with divers honourable Lords as a Committee of forreign affaires,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:160472:9"/>
who by reaſon of the variety of complaints, which came from the ſeverall Ambaſſadors of <hi>Spaine, France,</hi> the <hi>States,</hi> and orhers, of the ſhips and goods of their Maſters ſubjects to be taken in reprizall, by ſhips im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by the Parliament, were often incumbred with many intricate points of State; And it was no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſervice which thoſe noble Lords and the reſt of that Committee, laboured under to defend the juſt rights of the Parliament, upon thoſe ſeverall Emergencies which fell out, in ſpeciall, between the Ambaſſadors of the <hi>States;</hi> And this Committee, who after three Moneths debate, did maintaine the Actions of the Parliament as warrantable, by Treaties of State, and by Law of Nature, and Nations; As by a Declaration ſent unto the States from both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Parliament, moſt clearely appeareth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this Committee held conſtant weekly intelligence with the Parliaments Agents imployed in <hi>France, Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> for the obtaining of Juſtice for thoſe Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, who were agrieved by the taking or ſeazure of their ſhips or goods, or otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>There was another burthen lay on that Committee, which was the managing of that moſt Chriſtian and honourable work for the Redemption of the poore Captives from their ſlavery under the <hi>Turke,</hi> who with the help and unwearied paines of divers wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Merchants of the City of <hi>London,</hi> did with all advantage carry on that work, which will bee me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable to Poſterity: The care of the money col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected for thoſe uſes, and the imployment of them being truſted by the Parliament, with that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, and that truſt with all faithfullneſſe diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, ſo as had not that ſad accident happened on

the Ship <hi>Honour</hi> in the loſſe of the firſt Cargaſon at Gilbraltar, (which much increaſed the trouble of that Committee, and thoſe Gentlemen) the work had well neare been finiſhed; yet bleſſed be God, two hundred and fifty Captives are redeemed and brought home, Ten thouſand pounds ſterling more in peeces of Eight ſent away for <hi>Argier,</hi> and another Cargaſon of the like value ready to be ſent upon the firſt intelligence from the Agent at <hi>Argier:</hi> And care is taken for the redemption of thoſe in <hi>Tunnis, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Saphia,</hi> and all <hi>ſouth Barbary.</hi> Beſides all thoſe publick and weighty imployments of that Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, unceſſant were their labours in particular buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes referred unto them by the Houſe of Commons: As the recovery in of the monyes due on the bonds delivered in by the Farmours taken for Cuſtomes in the time of the late Act of Parliament: preparing Ordinances for the advancement of the Trade of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Companys of Merchants trading into for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign parts, with limited Rules and Reſtrictions; compoſing of differences upon ſeverall occaſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Merchants and Officers of the Cuſtomes; and examining, and ſtating that intricate affaire of the Vintners, which ſubjected them to juſt Fines; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other buſineſſes of great weight and intricacy, and were with all cheerefullneſſe and faithfullneſſe tranſacted to cleare up the Honour and Iuſtice of the Parliament: and that without the uſe of any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary power, but in all caſes which they found pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to receive their Tryalls in any Courts of Iuſtice, were carefull to referr ſuch cauſes to their proper Courts.</p>
            <p>But the whole former Narrative may bee true, yet the Honour of the Parliament, or of the Committee
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:160472:10"/>
of the Navy no way cleared, but rather ſtands the more deeply charged: For it doth appeare by ſeverall paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the Narrative, That the Committee of the Navy have executed the power and truſt of two great Officers of State; as in the firſt yeare of theſe unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Diſtempers, being 1642, the Office of the Lord High Admirall: and from that very yeare to this day the greateſt part of the office and truſt of the Lord Treaſurert; Theſe had the power of diſpoſing multitudes of offices, the one In the Navy, the other in the Cuſtomes; beſides great fees and other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites of profit and great advantage; yet the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Committee reſted not here, but the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative ſetts forth divers other imployments of truſt, whereby great advantages have bin very probably made by that Committee or ſome private Gentlemen, as the preferment of perſons to Offices, and thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy or not qualified for ſuch Offices, and men of more merit, ſufferings and abilities laid by, which doth lay a great blemiſh on the honour of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to imploy their own Members in ſuch great places of truſt and advantage; And this is viſible to all men, that the Chaireman of that Committee, had five hundred pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> allowed him, beſides all his other great advantages, or otherwiſe neither he nor ſome others of that Committee would ever have followed the affaires of that Committee, with that zeale and paines early and late, that ſcarce a Tradeſ-man in the City, or husband-man in the Countrey tooke the like: ſo that he was thereby brought to ſuch weakneſſe at three times, he was at the very gates of death by ſedentary diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>Vnto all which it is neceſſary to give this further account that as to my own particular, I do here in the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:160472:10"/>
preſence of the Almighty God, the ſearcher of all hearts, and the righteous Iudge as well of all mens intentions, as of their Actions, proteſt; That next that duty I owe unto God, who hath called me to this imployment, and to the Parliament, who hath intruſted mee with the ſame, and to my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, for whoſe ſake and preſervation I was ſent hither, all irreſiſtable motives to an Ingenious and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable Chriſtian, to make me account no labour too great, nor care too much, to be any way inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall in ſo great and glorious a work as the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Church and State, being the main end of the Endeavours of the Parliament; I ſay next the duty I owed to thoſe former relations, I was impatiently ſtudious (with the help, wiſedome, and care of that Committee) to manage thoſe great workes with that advantage to the Common-wealth, and with that cleareneſſe from all private ends, as that on the one ſide the King, on the other ſide the people, might be in love with Parliaments; the King that he might ſee the grear difference in the managing of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of State, between the Councells of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and his old Councellours, of whom he was ſo fond, and by moſt of whom he was ſo groſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and the State abuſed; on the other ſide, that the people might ſee their happineſſe under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a King directed by the Councell of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, in receiving redreſſe of their grievances, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiſe in their wants, due and ſpeedy juſtice with all cleereneſſe, and without conſumption of their time, by long attendance, or of their eſtates by needleſſe and forced expences. And as to the five hundred pound allowed mee by the Parliament, towards the defraying of my expences, having my whole eſtate then under
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:160472:11"/>
the power of the Enemy for above three yeares; I acknowledge it a great mercy from God, and a great favour in the Parliament, to provide ſo liberally for me: yer I doe profeſſe that thoſe monies have not ſupplied my neceſſities, but before the Quarters have come about, I have been forced to borrow mony of my children or ſervants, for to defray my ordinary disburſements; yet have I not bin profuſe either in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell or dyet, but have lived in a far leſſe plenty then before I came to attend the ſervice of the Parliament.</p>
            <p>And as to the diſpoſing of thoſe ſeverall Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, either in the Navy or Cuſtomes; I doe make this Anſwer, that it is true, that many hundreds of perſons moſt of them deſtroyed in their Eſtates by theſe civill warrs, had their Petitions ly before that Committee for preferments unto office; and that Committee did accordingly diſpoſe of very many as they fell, wherein they uſed all poſſible care that the perſons they preferred ſhould be qualified for the imployment, men that had ſuffered in their Eſtates, and recommended for their integrities; And to my beſt remembrance they never preferred any but upon the ſpeciall recommendation and certificate of the Members of one or both Houſes or Parliament: All which offices were by that Committee conferred with ſo much care and clearneſſe, as what ever was the former practice of officers of State, in diſpoſing of them for money, a thing too apparent, and too great a blemiſh to thoſe times: yet I doe with all confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence affirme, that neither my ſelfe, nor any Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of that Committee ever received one penny for any ſuch preferment; And that Committee in this point have been ſo exact and tender, in regard of the Scandall that might ariſe to the Parliament,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:160472:11"/>
by ſale of Offices, as that they have from time to time taken ſtrict Account of the Clerks attending that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, what advantages they made by the diſpoſing of ſuch Offices; And it appeares by their Accounts duly kept, they have gotten between them all for Orders, Warrants, and Grants for Offices, not full thitty five pound, whereof neare forty places have been Cuſtomers, Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulers, and Searchers in the Cuſtome houſe, all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of repute and profit,</p>
            <p>And as to the profits which did ariſe the firſt year, for the Admirall tenths, and were alwayes by him carefully taken and converted to his private uſe. I do confeſſe there were Prizſes taken that year which amounted unto twenty two thouſand pound or thereabouts, whereof two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred pound accrued to the tenths, but that neither out of the tenths, nor any other profits whatſoever, I never received one farthing, but all the profits were faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully converted by that Committee to the uſe of the State.</p>
            <p>As to the Office of the L. Treaſurer in the diſpoſing of moneys, the laſt particular, and wherein ſatisfaction may more eſpecially be expected, of what advantages have been made by the moneys ariſing by thoſe three ſprings, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe appropriate to the diſpoſall of this Committee.</p>

            <p>And to ſatisfie the World of my own integrity, I do ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly profeſſe, as in the preſence of God, at whoſe Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall, I muſt give an account for all my Actions before all Men and Angels; that for the appointing of all thoſe moneys diſpoſed of by that Committee, I never received, nor any other to my knowledge for my uſe, any Summe or Summes of money, not the value of a penny from any perſon or perſons whatſoever as a Fee, Bribe, Reward, or what other name you may give it; but the ſame hath in every part been faithfully conveyed from the Treaſury of the State to the hands of the ſubject with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any advantage made upon them, ſaving that there

was about foure yeares ſince, three pounds ſent unto me from a Captaine at Sea for a Beaver hat, which mony I gave freely away, and was diſpoſed to my beſt remembrance thirty ſhillings to the diſtreſſed prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants which came from Ireland, the other moity to maymed Souldiers in the Parliaments ſervice:) Nor have I ever received any Sume or Sums for any other affai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

If any man can juſtly charge me with any ſuch matter, there is a Committee appointed by the Houſe of Commons for examination of ſuch matters, where he may complaine: and I will give him foureſold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations; Or further, if any man can make it evident, that he hath given any thing as a reward, gratuity, or ſuch like to my wife, any child, ſervant, or any other for my uſe, I will make him reparation to the full value.</p>
            <p>And for any Gentleman, or other perſon, that hath at any time by way of civility brought or ſent me any thing whatſoever, which yet among men is lawfull, and may have in it no diſhoneſt intentions either in the giver or receiver; I doe hereby invite and deſire him to let me know the value of the ſame, and I will wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſatisfie him for it: And what I have here aſſerted on my own behalfe, I am confident I may with much freedome aſſert on the behalfe of thoſe worthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Committee, who conſtantly attended thoſe Services.</p>
