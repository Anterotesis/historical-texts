            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Worthy Brother <hi>JOHN
HALL,</hi> ſomtime of <hi>Grey's</hi>
Inne <hi>Eſquire,</hi> are no leſs
preſent to my thoughts, when I am at the

they are during my long Reſidences at
<hi>London,</hi> where I frequently converſe with
thoſe, who, knowing his <hi>worth,</hi> take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to celebrate it, upon the leaſt mention
of his <hi>Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Account I receiv'd from you of
<pb facs="tcp:48490:4"/>
Him not long ſince, and what you deſign'd
to have done thereupon, rais'd in me a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
reflection on the Excellencies of that
Perſon, at leaſt what was within the reach
of my happy knowledge of him. Of this
I gave the world what ſatisfaction I could,
before his Tranſlation of <hi>Hierocles upon
the Golden Verſes of the Pythagore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi>
that is, a ſhort Collection of my own
Obſervations, without communicating my
deſign to any of his Friends. What Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
you have made in order to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating
of it, I ſhall not here inſiſt upon,
further then to aſſure you, that my proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution

be anſwerable to your deſires.</p>
            <p>As to what is at preſent uſher'd to you
by this <hi>Dedicatory,</hi> be pleas'd, Sir, to take
this ſhort Character of it; That it is a
particular account of that Action, which
being of higheſt Importance in the Concerns
of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> occaſions the diſcourſe of
all perſons, during the proceſs of it, as
well of theſe, whoſe Principles induce
them to a <hi>belief,</hi> as thoſe, who ſtand upon

<pb facs="tcp:48490:4"/>
               <hi>ROME</hi> derives the Priviledge of being
the Scene of this great Tranſaction, is not
my buſineſs to enquire: yet I think it not
amiſs, to bring in here two Diſtichs of that
worthy Author, Sir <hi>R. Stapylton,</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending,

            <head>An Hiſtorical Account of the
Ceremonies at the Election
of a Pope.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>ROME,</hi> having heretofore
rais'd it ſelf to that Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
as to become the Seat
of the World's Empire,
continu'd its poſſeſſion
thereof for many after-Ages. During
that vaſt Interval of time its Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
had an Influence over the Affairs
and Concerns of moſt Nations: the
Changes and Revolutions of States
were regulated by its Policies; and
its Judgments were Legiſlative to all
places over which the Roman-Eagles
had ſpread their victorious wings: in
a word, the general Emergencies of
the Univerſe are the ordinary diſcourſe
of the Inhabitants of this great City:
and on the contrary, what is done in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48490:6"/>
it employs the reflections of all thoſe
who have heard of its name.</p>
            <p>But as it hapned heretofore at the
death of any of its Emperours, all
eyes were upon it, to obſerve the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of an Election, which they
thought contributory to their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or unhappineſs, though as yet the
Jurisdiction related only to temporal
Concerns: ſo is it ſince it became the
Seat of a ſpiritual Monarchy and Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy.
For upon every vacancy in
<hi>This,</hi> the whole Chriſtian World is
inquiſitive to know what paſſes in a
conjuncture of ſo great importance, to
the tranquillity and advantage of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom,</hi>
and wholly taken up with a
conſideration how worthy or how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
that ſubject ought to be, who is to
fill a Chair exalted above all the
Thrones upon earth.</p>
            <p>As therefore every one thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
concern'd in this exaltation to the
Papal Dignity, ſo does every one ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
he hath a right and freedom to
ſpeak, and give his judgment of it.
Accordingly hath it hapned, that all the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48490:6"/>
circumſtances of ſo celebrious and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
an action have been ſo well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
and thought of ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
that the Memorials thereof
have been tranſmitted to after-Ages;
to the end it ſhould be known, with
what extraordinary precautions they
were to proceed upon the like occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
in order to the prevention of thoſe
misfortunes and diſturbances, which the
long continuance of a vacancy hath
many times occaſion'd in the Church.
But what occaſions long vacancies, and
how far they are to be imputed to the
interfering Intereſts of thoſe temporal
Princes, who think themſelves more
nearly concern'd in the Election, is no<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

this ſeems rationally deducible from
their proceedings therein, that they
would demean themſelves with a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
indifference, as to the Election, were
they leſs perſwaded, that the Perſon
once elected muſt be acknowledg'd
Supreme Paſtor of the Catholick
Church.</p>
            <p>But in proceſs of time, through the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48490:7"/>
prudent proviſions, which the Popes
have made by their Conſtitutions:
things are reduc'd to a certain order,
ſo as that there is the leſs ground of
fearing thoſe fatal Accidents, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the Church hath been but too
much afflicted by ſo many ſchiſmes,
moſt of which have deriv'd their birth
or growth from the long continuance
of <hi>Conclaves.</hi> And the City of <hi>Rome</hi>
ſeems from that time to have attain'd
a better conſtitution, ſo as not to be
ſubject to any diſturbance during that
<hi>Interregnum;</hi> of which it is the deſign
of this Diſcourſe to give a particular
Account, by diſcovering what is done,
not only within the walls of <hi>Rome,</hi> but
alſo thoſe of the <hi>Conclave</hi> it ſelf, upon
the occaſion of a Vacancy in the See
Apoſtolick, and repreſenting the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
obſerved at the Exaltation of
a Perſon to a ſpiritual Jurisdiction
and Supremacy.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the Pope hath ſubmitted
to the Laws of Mortality by reſigning
up his laſt breath, or ſeems paſt all
hopes of recovery, the Cardinal <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:48490:7"/>
who is ordinarily the <hi>Nephew,</hi>
and entruſted with the management of
State-affairs, ſends an account of his
condition to the ſeveral Cardinals and
Embaſſadors: by the Prelates he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches
to them, and orders all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
priſoners to be remov'd out of
the ordinary Priſons to the Caſtle St.
<hi>Angelo,</hi> in regard that immediately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Pope's death the Senate and
People of <hi>Rome</hi> ſet open the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doors,
and give liberty to all thoſe
whom they there find in reſtraint.</p>
            <p>Soon after the Cardinals and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
make their Viſits to the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
Patrone,</hi> condoling the loſs he
hath received by the Pope's death; and
if it happen that any of them be in the
Pope's Antichamber, when he is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to expire, they are admitted into his
chamber to ſee his departure, and to
addreſs their prayers to God for
him.</p>
            <p>Aſſoon as he is given over for dead
the Cardinal's, and all the Officers,
who had lodgings aſſign'd them in the
Palace, diſlodge themſelves and go to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48490:8"/>
their houſes in the City, ſave only the
Cardinal, who has the title of <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain,</hi>
whoſe priviledge it is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
ſtill in the Pope's appartment.</p>
            <p>There are in the Sacred Colledge of
Cardinals, (whoſe number is by the
Conſtitution of <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> limited
to ſeventy) three principal Charges,
which admit not of any vacancy upon
the Pope's death, but only upon theirs
who were poſſeſt thereof. Thoſe are

He orders the coynage of money, on

Armes under thoſe of the vacant See,
which are two Keys croſſing one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

further priviledge, to be preſent with
the three Chiefs of the Order of the
Cardinals, (that is to ſay, the <hi>Dean</hi> of

and the firſt <hi>Cardinal-Deacon</hi>)
in all the Aſſemblies they ſhall hold
during the vacancy of the See, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe

and of the Grand Treaſurer
(who is Surintendant of the Finances
or Revenues) orders them to be

            <p>It is alſo incumbent on the ſaid Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
to ſend notice at the ſame time
to all the Cardinals, the Senate, and
people of <hi>Rome,</hi> of the Pope's death,
and the three Chiefs in point of Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination

ſend the like notice to all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Cardinals, to make their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48490:9"/>
to take order for all the Charges
which ſhall be vacant upon the Pope's
death, and to appoint a Governour of
the <hi>Conclave,</hi> and of St. <hi>Peter'</hi>s, which
is the moſt fortify'd Quarter of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and wherein lie the Caſtle of St. <hi>Angelo,</hi>
the Church of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the <hi>Vatican</hi>
Palace, and where the <hi>Conclave</hi> is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
kept; and they all go with
the Roquet uncover'd, as a mark that
the Sovereign Spiritual Authority is
devolv'd into their hands, as having
then no Superiours over them. Thoſe
who are Creatures of the deceas'd
Pope are clad in Violet, as are alſo
the other Cardinals, but with this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction,
that the borders and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of their garments are red.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Pope's Almo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
after they have waſht the Corps,
cloath it with his Caſſock, his Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet,
his Camad, and his Caloth, and
by a ſecret pair of ſtairs convey it to
the Chapel of <hi>Sixtus,</hi> which is in the
Palace. There it is received by the
Penitentiaries of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who veſt
him ſo as if he were going to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48490:10"/>
Maſs, ſetting on his head a Mitre
of cloth of Gold, with all the other
Ornaments peculiar to this Ceremony;
and among others the <hi>Pallium</hi> and <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nona,</hi>
which none is to wear but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Pope in his Pontifical Habili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Being thus habited, they lay him on
a Couch in the midſt of the Chappel,
with a ſilver Croſs upon his breaſt, and
two Cardinals Hats at his feet, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
his ſpiritual and temporal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
Ordinarily, there are but a
dozen Torches ſet about the Corps, and
no Canopy.</p>
            <p>The Congregation of Cardinals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
riſen, the Creatures of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd
and his particular ſervants come
into the Chapel; where, after they
have ſaid certain prayers for his ſoul,
the Canons of St. <hi>Peter</hi> make their
entrance with their Croſſes, with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one a wax candle in his hand, and
taking the Corps they carry it into one
of the Chapels of their Church,
where it lies expos'd for the ſpace of
three days to the ſight of all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48490:10"/>
who are admitted to kiſs his feet
and hands.</p>
            <p>After the expiration of thoſe three
days, the ſame Canons, accompany'd
by the Relations of the deceas'd (the
church-doors being ſhut) diſpoſe the
Body into his Sepulchre, in caſe he had
ordered any to be made in his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time;
but if not, they cover it with
plaiſter in ſome part of their ſaid
Church, till his Sepulchre be made
ready, which the ſucceeding Pope, if
he be a Creature of the deceas'd, does
ordinarily cauſe to be made at his own
charge, together with one for himſelf,
in ſuch Church as he ſhall think fit to
make choice of: Yet is it to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
that the Body is to continue a
whole year depoſited in the ſaid Church
of St. <hi>Peter;</hi> after which it may be
buried any where elſe, and the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation
of it is celebrated with great
pomp aud magnificence; and they uſe
in that Ceremony a particular Herſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth
embroidered, which the Clergy of
<hi>St. Peter</hi> are oblig'd to get made for
every Pope immediately after his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Election,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48490:11"/>
which Cloth is carefully
laid up, during the life of the ſaid
Pope.</p>
            <p>The firſt day after the departure of
any Pope being over, the Cardinals
employ the mornings of the nine ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent
days in having Dirges ſung
for the repoſe of the ſoul of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd;
and on the ninth the Funeral-Oration
is made; after which all the
Cardinals come about the Quire beſet
all with lights, under which there is a
Bed of State, and five among them (of
which number the Cardinal, who ſays
Maſs is one) with black.</p>
            <p>on, having given holy-water and
incenſe, ſay the Suffrages and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
Prayers.</p>
            <p>All the days next following the
ſaid Dirges of the ſaid Cardinals meet
in the Sacriſty of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to name
the Officers of the <hi>Conclave,</hi> and to
ſettle other affairs of the Eccleſiaſtical
State. The Embaſſadors make them
proffers of the Aſſiſtance of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
in order to the ſecurity and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the <hi>Conclave.</hi> At their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48490:11"/>
in, they make a genuflexion,
and ſpeak ſtanding and cover'd; and
at their departure thence they make
the like genuflexion. The Houſe of
the <hi>Urſini,</hi> and that of the <hi>Colonni,</hi> as
being the chiefeſt Houſes of <hi>Rome,</hi> are
alſo receiv'd into it, but kneeling and
bare-headed. They pretend that they
have a priviledge to offer with their
own ſervice, that, of all the other <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Princes and Lords. Theſe latter
on the contrary, (whoſe Body is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>Baronage</hi>) are not willing to
acknowledge any dependence on the
former two Houſes, and ordinarily
make choice of the moſt ancient
Perſon of their Body to make their
<hi>Harangue.</hi> This Conteſt upon the
death of <hi>Urban</hi> the Eighth, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd
the <hi>Urſini</hi> and the <hi>Colonni</hi> to
forbear going at all, and yet the <hi>Baron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age</hi>
was admitted to make proffers of
their ſervice.</p>
            <p>The ten days above-mentioned
being expired, on the eleventh the
Cardinals have a Dirge ſung at
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48490:12"/>
St. <hi>Peters,</hi> one of them celebrating
Maſs in Honour of the Holy Ghoſt,
after which there is a Sermon preach'd,
wherein they are exhorted to diveſt
themſelves of all paſſion and ſelf-intereſt
in the Election they are to
make of a good common Father of
the Church. After which they make
their entrance by way of Proceſſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Conclave,</hi> the Muſick ſinging the
<hi>Veni Creator,</hi> and lay their Croſſes in
the Chapel <hi>Paulina.</hi> The Dean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come up to the Altar ſays the
Prayer, <hi>Deus qui corda fidelium:</hi> which
ended, the Cardinals take the Oath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for the obſervance of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
of former Popes concerning
the Election of the new one. That
done, every one goes to dinner in his
own Apartment, which had been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
them in the Palace, for the
preparing of their ſuſtenance during
their abode in the <hi>Conclave,</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not permitted to come out of the
Palace till they have choſen a Pope.</p>
            <p>All that day the Conclave lies open,
to ſatisfie the curioſity of the people,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48490:12"/>
who are permitted during that time to
viſit it; and towards the Evening e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one withdraws into his Cell, and
about three or four hours after, the
<hi>Curſors</hi> or <hi>Heralds</hi> put out the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
crying aloud <hi>Extra omnes.</hi> But
the Embaſſadors, who had ſpent the
eleven days aforeſaid in viſiting all the
Cardinals at their ſeveral Lodgings,
come to ſee them once more in the
<hi>Conclave;</hi> and as ſoon as they are come
out thence, (which they commonly do
laſt of any) the chief Perſon of the
Houſe of the <hi>Savelli,</hi> as Hereditary
Marſhal of the Holy Church, locks
the door of the Conclave, ſets a Guard
at it, and hath an apartment adjoyning
thereto, out of which he is not to ſtir
either night or day till there be a
Pope choſen. At the laſt Conclave,
there aroſe a Conteſt between him and
the Governour of the ſaid <hi>Conclave</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Keys of it; but they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judg'd
to the Prince <hi>Savelli,</hi> as'having
been in former times in the poſſeſſion
of his Predeceſſors. The keeping of
the Keys within the Conclave belongs
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48490:13"/>
to the Cardinal-Chamberlian and the
Maſter of the Ceremonies.</p>
            <p>In the door of the <hi>Conclave</hi> there is a
little ſquare window, which may be
ſhut on both ſides within and without,
and is not open'd, but only when Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
or ſome other Perſon of
Quality brings ſome very important
advertiſement or intelligence to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Colledge, and then they direct
their Speech through the ſaid Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.</p>
            <p>According to the Conſtitution of
<hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth every Cardinal may
have two men with him to wait upon
him in the <hi>Conclave;</hi> but Princes and
the more ancient Cardinals may have
three and no more: and theſe perſons
are called <hi>Conclaviſts,</hi> who all joyning
together oblige all the Cardinals to
take an Oath for the Obſervance of
their priviledges. Nor can any of
the Cardinals balk the taking of the
ſaid Oath, out of a fear of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
which might be made him of
his deſire to be Pope. Their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
conſiſt in having ten thouſand
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48490:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Crowns out of the Chamber, to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
among them, and all the vacant
Benefices, not exceeding two thouſand
Crowns Revenue.</p>
            <p>Moreover, it is further requiſite, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the foreſaid Conſtitution of
<hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth, that the <hi>Conclaviſts,</hi> be
actually menial ſervants to the ſaid Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals
at the vacancy of the Holy See,
and that they had been in their ſervice
for the ſpace of a year before. With
this further <hi>Proviſo,</hi> that the Miniſters
of Princes, Perſons poſſeſſd of
in for, ost. temporal Seigneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
having the rights of the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of Juſtice annex'd thereto, as
alſo perſons employ'd in Traffick and
Commerce; and laſtly, the Brothers or
Nephews of Cardinals, cannot be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
by them for their <hi>Conclaviſts,</hi> though
they were their Domeſticks, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
wages or ſalaries from them.</p>
            <p>To this kind of perſons there are
added alſo two others, one for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the two Maſters of Ceremonies,
and the other, for the Secretary of the
Sacred Colledge. With this reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48490:14"/>
nevertheleſs, that the ſervant of
of the Maſters of the Ceremonies
ought to be actually a Domeſtick
of one of them, and have been
ſuch for the ſpace of ſix months
before: which condition is in like
manner requiſite in the ſervant to the
Secretary of the Colledge of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals.</p>
            <p>Beſides the Cardinals and their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claviſts,</hi>
the two <hi>Maſters</hi> of <hi>Ceremonies,</hi>
the <hi>Secretary</hi> of the Colledge, and their
ſervants there are alſo ſhut up in the
<hi>Conclave</hi> a <hi>Penitentiary,</hi> to receive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions,
and reſolve ſuch Caſes of
Conſcience as may be propos'd to him;
as alſo a <hi>Sacriſtan,</hi> with a Chaplain to

a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> an <hi>Apothecary,</hi> and a <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon,</hi>
with one or two ſervants, and
the Drugs and Medicines requiſite for
the relief and accommodation of the
indiſpos'd; a Carpenter, a Maſon,
and about twenty Porters or ſervants of
the meaneſt ſort, to be employed in the
carrying of wood, ſweeping the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
and the ſtreets of the Conclave,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48490:14"/>
and to what other ſervices may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
within. All theſe Officers and
Servants are choſen by the Cardinals
by plurality of voices, and are not to
be taken out of the houſes of any of
the ſaid Cardinals, and their Salaries
are paid out of the Chamber.</p>
            <p>Aſſoon as they have clear'd the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave
of all thoſe perſons, whom ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their curioſity or ſome other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
had brought thither, the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor's
alſo being retir'd, and the door
lockt on the out-ſide by the Marſhal of
the Conclave, who has the Keys of
it, and is to ſee it guarded, the three
Cardinals, Chiefs of the three dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Claſſes, accompany'd by the
Cardinal-Chamberlain, and one of
the Maſters of Ceremonies, who have
the cuſtody of the Keyes within, (as
hath been obſerv'd already) go with
Torches all about the Conclave, viſiting
all parts of it, to ſee if there be any there
who ought not to be, and whether the
ſhutting up of the Conclave be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
according to the Conſtitutions.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48490:15"/>
And the next day, immediately after
dinner, there is a review taken of all
the <hi>Conclaviſts</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> in the
Chapel, out of which they are order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to go one after another, to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd,
whether they have the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
requiſite for their admiſſion,
as alſo whether they exceed not the
number appointed by the ſaid Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions.</p>
            <p>But, before we come to a particular
Account of what paſſes among the
Cardinals in the Conclave, it will not
be amiſs to ſay ſomewhat of what is
done in the mean time, in reference
to the Government of the City.</p>
            <p>Upon the News ſpread abroad of
the Pope's death, the Senate and People
of <hi>Rome,</hi> (that is to ſay, the Conſuls of
the City) being aſſembled in the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
cauſe it to be publiſh'd through all
the ſtreets by beat of drum, order the
priſon-doors to be open'd, and ſet at
liberty all they find in reſtraint, thereby
ſignifying that the Jurisdiction of
<hi>Rome</hi> during the Vacancy of the Holy
See, is devoted to them. They order
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48490:15"/>
all the Inhabitants to keep a candle
lighted at their Window during all
that night, and enjoyn the Captains of
the ſeveral Wards or Quarters, (whoſe
Companies conſiſt of men, whom the
Inhabitants of all Ranks and Orders,
(excepting only both the <hi>Roman</hi> and
<hi>Foreign</hi> Nobility) are oblig'd to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
them withal, to the number of one
for every Houſe with their Armes) to
keep ſtrict Guards day and night, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one in their Lodgings, and to take
their ſeveral rounds and <hi>patrouilles,</hi> to
prevent the diſorders which are many
times very great, proceeding hence,
that ſuch as have been hardly or inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
dealt with, during the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Papacies, do for the moſt part de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
their reſentments thereof to the
next vacant See; ſo that it happens
many Murthers and Aſſaſſinations
may be committed. Not but that
Juſtice is very ſeverely adminiſtred at
that time, and with greater expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
then at any other; but if the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers
and other miſchievous perſons
be not ſurpriz'd in the very Facts, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48490:16"/>
can make a ſhift to abſcond themſelves
and keep out of the way till the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of a new Pope, they return to
their habitations as if they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
thoſe crimes in ſome other
Countrey.</p>
            <p>All the Cardinals, Embaſſadors,
Princes and Lords about <hi>Rome</hi> raiſe
Souldiers for the guarding of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces
and their Houſes, and they among
the Cardinals who have any pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the Papacy are more careful in
this particular then the others, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the priviledge the people aſſume
to themſelves of pillaging them aſſoon
as they are choſen.</p>
            <p>There paſſes not a day without ſome
Proceſſions, which from all Churches
and Monaſteries take their way to St.
<hi>Peter</hi>'s, and about the <hi>Conclave,</hi> ſinging
as they go the Hymn <hi>Veni Creator,</hi> to
implore the aſſiſtance of the Holy
Ghoſt and its Inſpirations upon the
Cardinals.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Conclave</hi> conſiſts ordinarily of
three Galleries, aud twenty five or
thirty withdrawing-rooms or Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48490:16"/>
all of a floor, from the <hi>Vatican</hi>-Palace
of equal height with the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie
which is over the Portal of St.
<hi>Peter</hi>'s, which is the ordinary place of
the Benediction given by the Pope to
the people after his Coronation, and
upon the great Feſtivals of the year:
Which Gallery makes alſo part of the
Conclave. In all which Galleries,
rooms and chambers, they make parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of boards for ſo many Cells as
there are Cardinals. Every Cardinal
hath a Cell aſſign'd him about five pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in length, and about four in bredth,
with a little wardrobe proportionable
thereto. The Cells are taken by lot,
and every Cardinal is to take that the
number whereof he finds in his lot: and
whereas it happens that the Cardinals
are not all of them, during the whole
time, confin'd within the Conclave, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon the account of ſickneſs or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
the Cells which are not taken up
are divided among the next neighbors,
who make this advantage only of the
abſence or indiſpoſition of others, that
their rooms are ſomwhat enlarg'd therby;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48490:17"/>
but the abſent or ſick Cardinals, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
into the Conclave, reaſſume
their Cells, and ſo oblige thoſe who
had made uſe of them to content
themſelves with their own diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>They among the Cardinals, who
were Creatures of the deceas'd Pope,
hang their Cells within and without
with Cloth or Serge of a violet co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
and the others with green Serge,
all ſetting up their Armes over their
doors, which they make faſt only with
two ſtaves croſſing one the other after
the form of a St. <hi>Andrews</hi> Croſs. The
Officers and Servants of the Conclave
have their quarters aſſign'd them in
ſome remote part.</p>
            <p>At three or four avenues of the ſaid
Conclave, there are Turning-Boxes,
like thoſe in the Monaſteries of Nuns,
through which the meat ſent in to the
Cardinals and their <hi>Conclaviſts</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
Their Partizans and Servants at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
their meat as they were wont to
do their perſons when they were at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:48490:17"/>
Before the entrance of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
into the <hi>Conclave,</hi> there is a Liſt
taken of all the Prelates then about
the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Governour
of it appoints every day, two in the
morning, and as many in the afternoon,
every one in his rank, to be preſent at
the ſaid Turning-Boxes, to viſit and
obſerve whatever is ſent in to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals,
to prevent the ſending in of
Letters or Notes with the meat. They
are alſo to hinder all perſons from
ſpeaking to them or their <hi>Conclaviſts</hi>
at the ſaid Boxes, unleſs they ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud,
and in the <hi>Italian</hi> or <hi>Latin</hi>
Tongue, that every one may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
what is ſaid; inaſmuch as by
the <hi>Conſtitutions,</hi> it is matter of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
to talk of, or to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
what is done within the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding all the caution
and vigilance us'd as to this particular,
yet cannot ſome abuſes be prevented;
and people come to know what paſſes
there. This happens ſometimes by
the way of Notes or Advertiſements in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48490:18"/>
writing, which they find means to get
in, either by the connivance of ſome
Prelates, who are unwilling to diſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
the Crowns and Princes, whoſe
Patrizans they are, as they think they
ſhould do, by obſtructing their having
intelligence of what paſſes. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
alſo this is attributed to the
Cardinals themſelves, who do it to
promote their different engagements
and affections, or to prevent prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
their hopes, or that their precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are really eluded. Another way
yet, where there may be a diſcovery
made of proceedings in the <hi>Conclave,</hi>
is, a ſecret kind of language before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
ſtudied and agreed upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Conclaviſts,</hi> and their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondents,
whereof they make their
advantages when occaſion ſerves,
comprehending under the ſuppoſititi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
termes of houſhold-ſtuffe, Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or domeſtick Affairs, concerning
which they enquire News, the Names
of ſuch Cardinals as are propos'd, or
excluded, or that ſtand fair for the
Papal dignity; and ſo by diſguiz'd
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48490:18"/>
diſcourſes, and an affected Jargon appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
to divers ſenſes, diſcloſing what is
moſt ſecretly carried on in the <hi>Conclave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet is there not any thing to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
againſt the ſhutting up of the
Conclave, ſince it is done with all the
exactneſs imaginable. For the Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
are cloſe done up at the tops, and
the windows of all the rooms and Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries
are in like manner ſtop'd to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a foot of the upper part, which ſmall
diſtance is clos'd with courſe linen
cloth, whereby a little light comes in;
but ſo that if the Cardinals have any
occaſion to write or read, they muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
have a wax-candle ſtanding by
them. And thence it proceeds, that not
receiving any ſupplies of freſh air from
without, and that within being many
times infected and corrupted, they are
apt to fall ſick, eſpecially when the
<hi>Conclaves</hi> are of long continuance.</p>
            <p>The twelfth day after the Pope's death
(the firſt, as hath bin already obſerv'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſpent in conveying the Body into one
of the Chapels of St. <hi>Peter'</hi>s Church, and
the nine ſubſequent days in celebrating
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48490:19"/>
Obſequies and ſinging Dirges for the
ſoul of the deceas'd, and holding the
ordinary Congregations at the end of
the ſaid Dirges; and the eleventh, in
the Cardinals taking poſſeſſion of the
<hi>Conclave,</hi> which for all that day lies
open to ſatisfie the curioſity of the
people, who come not out of it till
three or four houres after night) all the
Cardinals reſident about the Court of
<hi>Rome,</hi> having ſhut themſelves up in the
<hi>Conclave,</hi> ina much as by the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Gregory</hi> XV. there can be no
warrantable proceeding to the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
till the ſhutting up of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave
be compleated, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
ſuch by a publick Act, which
is made thereof at the requeſt of the
Maſter of the Ceremonies: All theſe
things being thus order'd in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the ſaid twelfth day, before
they apply themſelves to any thing
concerning the Election, the three Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals,
Chiefs of the ſeveral Orders,
and the Cardinal <hi>Chamberlain</hi> give a
Commiſſion to ſome within, to take an
exact Survey of all parts of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48490:19"/>
to ſee that it is cloſe and well
ſhut up of all ſides. Which if they
find accordingly, after they have
made their report thereof to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
it is form<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d into an Authentick
Act, the ſubſtance whereof amounts
to this, That the Conclave is cloſe
and ſhut up, as it is requir'd it ſhould
be by the Conſtitutions, and account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and reputed ſuch by the Sacred Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Cardinals. And this Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
is ſo eſſential, and of ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
neceſſity, that there would be a
nullity in the Election, which ſhould
be made without this precedent Act.
And as long as there is no Declaration
contrary to that of the ſhutting up of
the Conclave, that is, till ſuch time as
it ſhall have been declared by the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages
of two Thirds of the Cardinals,
that there is an overture of the ſaid
Conclave, it is always accounted and
reputed duly ſhut up; And the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
which might be made after the
publication of the Cloſure, cannot be
diſputed as to nullity, under pretence
of any overture hapning afterwards, if
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48490:20"/>
the Declaration of the Overture had
not been made with the advice of two
thirds of the Colledge of Cardinals.</p>
            <p>The Cardinals are permitted to hold
their capitulary Aſſemblies or Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
to agree among themſelves
upon certain Articles, before they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
npon the buſineſs of the Election.
Theſe Articles are to be ſign'd by all,
even thoſe which concern the privileges
of the <hi>Conclaviſts</hi> heretofore mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
before or after their entrance into
the Conclave, provided always that the
Election be not retarded thereby.</p>
            <p>There is alſo a further examination
made, before they fall upon any thing
touching the Election, whether among
the Cardinals there be any one that
hath not receiv'd the order of Deacon,
to the end he might not be admitted to
give his voice, inaſmuch as he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
by the Conſtitution of <hi>Pius</hi> IV.
unleſs he had obtain'd permiſſion in
writing from the deceas'd Pope to do
it. Nay, it hath ſometimes heretofore
come into debate, whether a Cardinal,
on whom ſilence had been impoſ'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48490:20"/>
the Pope's death, could give his
Suffrage for the Election of another
Pope? But this queſtion was decided
by <hi>Pius</hi> V. who, by the Decretal of
<hi>January</hi> 26. 1571. declar'd, that that
impoſition of ſilence was only a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
introduc'd only to keep the
Cardinals in a certain advertency (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were admitted to give their
voices and Suffrages, as the Conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and Congregations wherein they
were to aſſiſt) of that modeſty and
reſervedneſs, which they were oblig'd
to expreſs in thoſe and all other Acts,
but not to deprive them of their power
and principal function, which conſiſts
in the Election of a Pope. And this
Conſtitution hath ever ſince been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably
obſerv'd.</p>
            <p>The ſhutting up of the Conclave intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
at the Council of <hi>Lyons,</hi> by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of <hi>Greg.</hi> X. 1274. having ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
bin duly acknowledg'd and verifi'd,
the Cardinals (being advertiſ'd by the
ringing of a Bell to reſort to the Chapel
<hi>Paulina,</hi> which is within the compaſs of
the Conclave, if not diverted by ſickneſs)
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48490:21"/>
on the very morning of the twelfth
day, go to hear Maſs, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
as they are oblig'd to do, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after ought to proceed to the
Election. Which Election, at the
preſent, by the Conſtitution of <hi>Gregory</hi>
XV. confirmed by another ſince of <hi>Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi>
VIII. cannot be made, otherwiſe
then by one of theſe three formes and
manners following; to wit, either by
way of <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> or by <hi>Compromiſe;</hi>
or laſtly, by <hi>Scrutiny</hi> and <hi>Acceſs;</hi> all
which it is but requiſite that we expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
and make as intelligible as may
be, that it may be the more eaſily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible,
with what extraordinary
circumſpection and wiſe precautions
they are guided, in an affair of ſo high
conſequence.</p>
            <p>The firſt means or method of choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the Pope, which they call the way
of <hi>Inſpiration;</hi> or as it is expreſt by
the Sacred Canons <hi>As-it-were-by-Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
is, when all the Cardinals in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and every one in particular,
with a common voice, as being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd
by the Holy Ghoſt, are unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48490:21"/>
agreed, without any one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting
it, and without any prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
particular treaty, and do freely
concur to the acknowledging and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
of ſuch a perſon Pope. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which manner of Election we
are to obſerve the following Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
which are neceſſarily requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
by the <hi>Gregorian</hi> Conſtitution, which
is a perfect Directory, as to the ways
of proceeding at Elections, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
at preſent without any contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>The firſt circumſtance is, that this
kind of Election cannot be allowably
made any where but in the Conclave,
and that after the publication of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
duly ſhut up.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, that this Election is
to be made by all in general, by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of the Cardinals in particular,
who are preſent in the Conclave, by a
common Suffrage, and without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
from any one.</p>
            <p>The third circumſtance is, that there
muſt not have been any precedent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal,
or particular Treaty, in reference
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48490:22"/>
to a choice to be made by this kin<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of
way, which ought to be clearly <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2+ letters">
                  <desc>••…</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
by this word <hi>Eligo,</hi> I chuſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
with a loud and intelligible
voice, or, for want of pronunciation,
to be expreſly ſet down in writing.</p>
            <p>The Roman Ceremonial gives an
inſtance of an Election, which might
be allowably made by this kind of way,
which brought in hither will render
the buſineſs more cle<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid in the forementiond Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial,
that if any one of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals,
after publication of the ſhutting
of the Conclave, (there having not
been any precedent particular treaty
about the perſon whom he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe)
ſhould ſay, for example, in a full
Chapel, addreſſing his ſpeech to the
whole Sacred Colledge, <hi>My Lords, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
always obſerv'd the rare and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Qualifications and Vertues of my
Lord the Cardinal</hi> N. <hi>and having an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
for his remarkable Integrity, it is
my judgement that we cannot make
choice of a worthier ſubject to be Pope, and
thereupon I from this preſent give him
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48490:22"/>
my Suffrage, and chuſe him for Pope.</hi>
And that afterwards all the Cardinals,
with one voice, without excepting any
one, being of the ſame opinion, and all
of them intelligibly pronouncing one
after another the ſame word, <hi>I chuſe
him;</hi> or not being able to pronounce
it, ſetting it down in writing, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
would be canonically choſen, and
acknowledg'd for a true and legitimate
Pope, by that way which they call of
<hi>Inſpiration,</hi> or <hi>As-it-were-by-Inſpiration;</hi>
which in regard it is immediately at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by Adoration, is thence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called the way of Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The ſecond manner of proceeding in
the Election of the Pope, is the way of
<hi>Compromi'ſe,</hi> which is, when the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals,
either immediately after their
entrance into the Conclave, or wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
out with its long continuance, refer
themſelves to one or more among
them, whom they empower to make
proviſion, in the name of all, of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Father to the Catholick Church.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48490:23"/>
And this kind of Election is practis'd
conformably to the <hi>Gregorian</hi> Bull, and
the conditions and proviſions contain'd
therein, which may alſo be reduced
to three.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, that all the Cardinals in
general, and every one in particular,
who are preſent in the Conclave, not
one contradicting or oppoſing it, ought
to make a <hi>Compromiſe</hi> in writing,
whereby they inveſt thoſe perſons
whom they take for <hi>Compromiſſaries</hi>
with an abſolute power and faculty to
make proviſion of a Paſtor for the
Holy <hi>Roman</hi> Church, yet with an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance
of the forme, as alſo the Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and conditions inſerted and expreſs'd
in the <hi>Compromiſe,</hi> and to do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the time preſcrib'd thereby: the ſaid
Cardinals, promiſing to acknowledge
and account the perſon, whom the
<hi>Compromiſſaries</hi> ſhall have thus choſen,
according to the extent of that power
which had been granted them by the
<hi>Compromiſe,</hi> the true and lawful Pope.</p>
            <p>The ſecond circumſtance is, that it
is not permitted any one of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſſaries</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:48490:23"/>
ſhould give himſelf his
own voice, otherwiſe his Election
ſhould be null.</p>
            <p>The third condition is, that the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſſaries</hi>
are oblig'd twice every day
to aſſemble, in order to their conferring
together, and promoting the execution
of the <hi>Compromiſe;</hi> in the morning im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after the hearing of Maſs,
and in the Evening after the recitation
of the Hymn <hi>Veni Creator Spiritus,</hi> and
the Prayer of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> to implore
its illuminations upon them. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they fall upon any thing of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
they are wont to make this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation
precedent thereto, <hi>That they
would not be underſtood to give their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
by all ſorts of words or expreſsions
which might fall from them in the heat of
the Debate, if they do not expreſly ſet it
down in writing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When they have abſolutely agreed
upon the choice of any perſon, and
have prpos'd him as ſuch to the Sacred
College, he it to be immediately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
as true Pope, and Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
elected.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:48490:24"/>
Theſe two ways of <hi>Inſpiration</hi> and
<hi>Compromiſe</hi> are not now much in uſe;
but the way of <hi>Scrutiny,</hi> or of <hi>Scrutiny</hi>
and <hi>Acceſs</hi> joyned together, is the moſt
ordinarily practis'd, wherein there
are many Ceremonies to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>For the Election of a Pope by this
laſt way, it is requiſite, according to
the Conſtitution of <hi>Alexander</hi> the
Third, in the Year of our Lord
MCLXXX. made at the Council of
<hi>Lateran,</hi> that there ſhould be two thirds
of the voices of the Cardinals; which
hath been confirm'd by ſubſequent
Bulls, and in our Age by thoſe of
<hi>Gregory</hi> XV. and <hi>Urban</hi> VIII. And
it is further requiſte, that in the
two thirds of the Voices, that of
the Cardianl choſen, be not included,
inaſmuch as there is a prohibition
upon pain of nullity of Election for
any one to chuſe himſelf, or give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
his own voice.</p>
            <p>They are oblig'd twice every day to
take the <hi>Scrutiny</hi> and the <hi>Acceſs;</hi> in the
morning, after Maſs; and in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48490:24"/>
after the Hymn <hi>Veni Creator
Spiritus,</hi> and the Prayer of the <hi>Holy
Ghoſt</hi> which are ſaid in the Chapel
<hi>Paulina</hi> at which the Cardinals are
oblig'd to be preſent, if not detain'd by
indiſpoſition, immediately, after the third
ringing of the Bell.</p>
            <p>There is a great ſecrecy to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
in the <hi>Scrutiny</hi> and <hi>Acceſs,</hi> and
the manner of proceeding therein may
be reduc'd to three principal actions.
The firſt is the previous or <hi>Fore-Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny;</hi>
the ſecond, that of <hi>Scrutiny</hi> and
<hi>Acceſs;</hi> and the third, that of the
<hi>Poſt-Scrutiny,</hi> or what follows the
<hi>Scrutiny</hi> and <hi>Acceſs</hi> aſſoon as they are
compleated.</p>
            <p>The particular explication of theſe
three different actions will give us a
fuller comprehenſion of this way of
<hi>Scrutiny</hi> and <hi>Acceſs,</hi> and give us to
underſtand what it is, by diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them as they are found explicated
in the <hi>Roman</hi> Ceremonial.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fore-Scrutiny</hi> may be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd
into five principal Acts: the
preparation of the <hi>Billets</hi> for the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48490:25"/>
               <hi>Scrutiny</hi> and <hi>Acceſs;</hi> the taking out
by <hi>lots,</hi> the names of the <hi>Scrutators</hi> and
<hi>Deputies,</hi> who are to collect the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages
of ſuch as are indiſpos'd; that of
<hi>writing</hi> them in the <hi>Billets</hi> of <hi>Acceſs,</hi>
that of <hi>folding</hi> them, and that of <hi>ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
them.</p>
            <p>The Maſters of the Ceremonies are
the perſons who take care for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
of the <hi>Billets,</hi> which they
cauſe to be printed according to the
forme hereafter ſet down, as well for
the <hi>Scrutiny</hi> as <hi>Acceſs.</hi> They put them
into two Baſins upon a Table before
the Altar; thoſe of the <hi>Scrutiny</hi> by
themſelves in one of the Baſins, and
thoſe of the <hi>Acceſs</hi> in the other; in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
ſo many as there are Cardinals.</p>
            <p>The Figure of the <hi>Billet</hi> of the <hi>Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny</hi>
is ſuch, that the length exceeds the
bredth. It is about a hands bredth in
length, and about half as broad. The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
of the <hi>Billet</hi> comprehends three
things; in the upper part of it are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
theſe words, <hi>Ego Cardinalis,</hi> with as
much diſtance between the one and the
other, as may be requiſite for the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48490:25"/>
down of the Cardinal's name who
gives his voice, and a little lower there
are two little Circles denoting the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
where the Seal is to be ſet.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of the <hi>Billet</hi> are imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
theſe words, <hi>Eligo in ſummum Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem
Reverendiſſimum D. meum, D. Cardina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>—
I chuſe for Supream Biſhop the moſt
Reverend Lord, my Lord Cardinal.—</p>
            <p>In the third and loweſt part of the
Billet are in like manner imprinted
two little Circles, denoting alſo the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Seal, and all the reſt is blank.</p>
            <p>The form and figure of the <hi>Billets</hi>
for the <hi>Acceſs,</hi> is in all reſpects like that
of the <hi>Billets</hi> of the <hi>Scrutiny,</hi> ſave only
that in the midſt of them, in ſtead of
theſe words [<hi>Eligo in ſummum Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem

The ſecond Act of the <hi>Fore-Scruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
is, that of drawing by lot, the names
of the Scrutators and the Infirmaries,
who are the Cardinals appointed to
go to the Cells of ſuch as are indiſpos'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and there to take their Suffrages, which
is done in this manner. There are put
into a purſe as many little Bullets or
Balls, hol'd through the middle, about
the bigneſs of Beads, as there are Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals
in the Conclave, with their
Names written in little ſnips of Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
roll'd up, and thruſt through
the holes in the little Bullets, which
the Maſters of the Ceremonies take
care to provide, as they do the <hi>Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets.</hi>
As they are put into the purſe
they are counted all one after another,
in the preſence of the Cardinals, and
then after they have been well ſhaken
together, the laſt of the Deacon-Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals
draws three out of the purſe,
and they whoſe names are found in
them are choſen for <hi>Scrutators,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the order wherein they are
drawn out of the purſe. Then they
draw out three others for the <hi>Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maries</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:48490:28"/>
or <hi>Deputies,</hi> who are to go to
ſuch as are ſick. And that done, the
little Bullets are return'd into the purſe.
Twice a day, that is, in the morning
and afternoon before the <hi>Scrutiny,</hi> there
is an Election made of the ſaid Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.
But if it happen that they draw
the names of any of the Cardinals that
are ſick, or cannot by reaſon of ſome
other impediment acquit themſelves of
the function of the ſaid charges of
<hi>Scrutators</hi> and <hi>Infirmaries,</hi> there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
drawn in their ſtead.</p>
            <p>The third Act of the <hi>Fore-Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny</hi>
conſiſts in ſetting down what is
to be written in the <hi>Billets,</hi> and in the
filling of them by the Cardinals with
their own names, and the name of
the Cardinal to whom they give
their Suffrages, and their Signets.
To do this, every Cardinal, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his rank, beginning with
the Dean or moſt ancient, goes
and takes out of the Baſin where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the <hi>Billets</hi> of the <hi>Scrutiny</hi> are
ſtanding upon the Altar one Billet,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48490:29"/>
and thereupon retiring into one of the
two or three little Desks or Seats prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for that purpoſe, and furniſhed with
Pen and Ink in the middeſt of it, or to
ſome other part of the Chapel, ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to the ſight of all, that they may
eaſily ſee him writing, but not diſcern
what is written; and taking his ſeat
prepar'd alſo near the Desk, he fills up
his Billet thus; in the upper part he
writes between theſe words [<hi>Ego
Cardinalis</hi>] his own name;
in the midſt of it he inſerts the name of
him to whom he gives his voice, with
ſome difference and diſguiſe of chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
as much as he can, according to the
Bull of <hi>Gregory</hi> XV. that it may not be
known by the writing: and in the lower
part of the Billet is written ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
number in figures, according to his
own phanſie, with ſome ſentence out of
the holy Scripture, or ſomewhat of that
nature. The figure of a Billet fill'd up
will render what we have ſaid more
manifeſt to the eye.</p>

The <hi>folding</hi> of the <hi>Billets</hi> is the
fourth Act of the <hi>Fore-Scrutiny:</hi> It is
no hard matter to comprehend how it
is done. By the fold which is made
of the Billet, in the upper part of it,
the corners whereof are to be turn'd
down upon the marks of the Seal, the
name of the Cardinal Elector is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd.
In like manner, by the folding
which is made of the lower part of the
Billet, the corners whereof are alſo to
be laid over the marks of the Seal, the
Signes are likewiſe cover'd. After
theſe two foldings, they fold it ſo often
as is requiſite to reduce it to the bredth
of an Inch or thereabouts.</p>
            <p>There remains yet the laſt Act of
the <hi>Fore-Scrutiny,</hi> which conſiſts in
<hi>ſealing</hi> the <hi>Billets,</hi> the form whereof
is as eaſily conceivable, as that of the
precedent folding. Every Cardinal
before his entrance into the Conclave,
muſt have furniſht himſelf with a
Seal, unknown to the others, purpoſely
grav'd for this occaſion, containing
ſome fancy or character, or ſimple-fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
the impreſſion whereof may be
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48490:30"/>
eaſily perceiv'd. With this Seal
the Cardinal makes an Impreſſion
on the back of the Billet, at the
places deſign'd by the little Circles,
on which the Maſters of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
before the putting of the <hi>Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets</hi>
into the Baſins, had claqt little bits
of red wax.</p>
            <p>Theſe things thus perform'd, the
Cardinals proceed to the ſecond princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Action called the <hi>Scrutiny,</hi> which
the Ceremonial hath diſtinguiſh'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
eight particular Acts. Theſe are,
the <hi>carrying</hi> of the <hi>Billets</hi> to the
Altar; The taking of the <hi>Oath;</hi>
The putting of the <hi>Billets</hi> into the
<hi>Chalice</hi> prepar'd for the reception of
them; The mixture which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
made thereof; The <hi>numbring</hi>
of the <hi>Billets;</hi> The <hi>Publication</hi> of
the <hi>Scrutiny;</hi> The <hi>Filing</hi> of the
<hi>Billets;</hi> And the <hi>laving</hi> of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
either upon ſome part of the
Altar, or upon the Desks of the
<hi>Scrutators,</hi> or in an empty Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:48490:31"/>
The carrying of the Billets to the
Altar, the taking of the Oath, and the
putting of the <hi>Billets</hi> into the Chalice,
are three acts, ſo conſequent one to
the other, that it is no hard matter to
make a joynt imagination of them. And
to that end, preſuppoſing that every
Cardinal hath at the Desk (as aforeſaid)
fill'd up the <hi>Billet</hi> of the Scrutiny with
his own name, the name of him, to
whom he gives his voice, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
ſignes, that he hath folded it,
and ſeal'd it, according to the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
explication, he takes the ſaid Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
with the two fore-fingers of the
right hand, he carries it openly up to
the Altar, where the <hi>Scrutators</hi> are
ſtanding at the Desk, which had been
there prepar'd for them; and being
come thither, he falls down on his
knees, and makes a ſhort prayer; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which, riſing up, with a loud and
intelligible voice, he takes the Oath
according to the forme, wherein it is
tranſcrib'd in a Table upon the Altar,
in theſe termes, <hi>Teſtor Chriſtum Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,
qui me judicaturus eſt, me eligere,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48490:31"/>
quem, ſecundum Deum, judico eligi de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere,
et quod idem in Acceſſu praeſtabo.</hi>
That is to ſay, <hi>I Atteſt Jeſus Chriſt my
Lord, who is to be my Judge, that I chuſe
him, whom according to God's Will I
think fitteſt to be choſen; and that I will
do the like in the Acceſs.</hi> Having thus
taken the Oath, he lays his Billet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Cover of the Chalice, and with
the Cover he puts it into the Chalice, and
thereupon making an obeiſance to the
Altar, he retires to his place.</p>
            <p>This Ceremony is obſerv'd by all the
Cardinals, who are able to come up to
the Altar. For if it happen, that any
one of the Cardinals then preſent in the
Chapel is not able, by reaſon of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,
to come up to the Altar, the
<hi>Junior</hi> of the Scrutators takes the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin,
wherein the <hi>Billets</hi> of the <hi>Scrutiny</hi>
are, and carries it to him, out of which
the indiſpos'd Cardinal having taken a
<hi>Billet,</hi> he ſecretly fills it up, at his own
Desk, folds it, and ſeals it, as is before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned;
and after he hath taken
the foreſaid Oath in the place where
he is, he delivers his ſaid <hi>Billet</hi> to the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48490:32"/>
               <hi>Scrutator,</hi> who openly carries it up to the
Altar, and without any Prayer or Oath
lays it on the Cover, and with the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
conveys it into the Chalice. The
ſame thing is done towards all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpos'd
Cardinals who are in the Chapel.</p>
            <p>But as to thoſe Cardinals, who, by
reaſon of ſickneſs are not able to ſtir
out of their Cells, the <hi>Infirmary</hi>-Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals
choſen by lot to go and receive
their voices, go to the Desk of the
<hi>Scrutators,</hi> and take from their hands a
Box with a hole in the upper ſide of it,
having a Lock and Key to it about
a hands bredth high. This Box is
publickly opened by the <hi>Scrutators,</hi>
before the delivery of it to the <hi>Infirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
to the end that every one of the
Cardinals may ſee it is empty, and
that done they lock it up with the
Key, which they lay upon the Altar,
and then give the Box to the <hi>Infirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
who, having taken a little Baſin,
with as many <hi>Billets</hi> therein as there are
Cardinals ſick in their Cells, go to them.</p>
            <p>The indiſpos'd Cardinals having
taken their <hi>Billets</hi> out of the Baſin, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48490:32"/>
fill them up, fold them, and ſeal
them, and after they have made the
ordinary Oath, put them into the hole
of the Box.</p>
            <p>If the Cardinal's ſickneſs be ſuch
as that he is not able to write, he
makes choice of ſuch perſon as he
thinks fit to fill up his Billet. But
the ſaid perſon ſo appointed to fill it
up, is oblig'd to make Oath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Infirmary</hi>-Cardinals, that he
will not reveal the ſecret then entruſted
to him: And this he is bound to do, not
only upon the Obligation of the ſaid
Oath, but alſo upon pain of incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
excommunication <hi>ipſo facto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Suffrages of the indiſpos'd
Cardinals being thus collected by the
<hi>Infirmaries,</hi> they return to the Chapel,
deliver the Box to the <hi>Scrutators,</hi> who
opening it, take out the <hi>Billets,</hi> which
after they have been numbred, they
lay, one after another upon the Cover
of the Chalices, and with the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
convey them into the Chalice.</p>
            <p>But to the end the <hi>Scrutiny</hi> may not
hold too long, and that it may be
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48490:33"/>
carry'd on without any interruption,
(as it is requir'd by the Balls) the <hi>Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary</hi>-Cardinals,
before they go to the
indiſpos'd, may fill the <hi>Billets</hi> with
their voices immediately after the
Dean-Cardinal; and then, while the
others make the <hi>Scrutiny,</hi> addreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the ſick to collect their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages.</p>
            <p>The mixture of the <hi>Billets</hi> makes
the fourth Act of the <hi>Scrutiny,</hi> and
conſiſts in the ſhaking of them well in
the Chalice with its cover on; which
is performed by the chiefeſt of the
<hi>Scrutators,</hi> who, to that end, takes
the Chalice from the Altar, and holding
with one hand by the foot, and having
the other upon the Cover, ſhakes the
Billets ſo as that it may not be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
which were put in firſt, which
laſt.</p>
            <p>The numbring of the <hi>Billets</hi> is the
fifth Act, immediately following the
mixture thereof, and is performed by
the <hi>Junior</hi> of the <hi>Scrutators,</hi> who takes
them one after another out of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
and counts them, and puts them
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48490:33"/>
into another empty Chalice prepar'd
for that purpoſe. If the number of
the Billets be not equal to that of the
Cardinals, they are all burnt, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
removing out of the place they
renew the <hi>Scrutiny.</hi> But if the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
be equal they proceed to the other
ſubſequent Acts of the <hi>Scrutiny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Publication, which is the ſixth
Act, and ought to be done by the
<hi>Scrutators</hi> ſitting at their Desk placed
before the Altar, is thus performed.
The chief <hi>Scrutator</hi> takes a Billet out
of the Chalice, which he unfolds,
without breaking the Seals of it, and
having diſcover'd and ſeen the name of
him to whom the Suffrage is given by
the <hi>Billet,</hi> he delivers it to the ſecond
<hi>Scrutator,</hi> who having alſo ſeen the
ſame name puts the <hi>Billet</hi> into the
hands of the third <hi>Scrutator,</hi> who reads
it with a loud and intelligible voice,
ſo as that all the Cardinals preſent in
the chapel may hear it, who having
before them their names ſet down in a
printed ſheer of paper, wherein op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
to every name there are lines
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48490:34"/>

               <p>If it ſhould happen in the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
that the <hi>Scrutators</hi> found two
<hi>Billets</hi> ſo folded together, to any ones
thinking, as if they were brought in
by one and the ſame perſon; if in
both theſe <hi>Billets</hi> there ſhould be found
one and the ſame thing, and one and
the ſame Cardinal named, they ſhall
be counted but for one; but if there
be a diverſity of Suffrages, neither is
worth any thing, yet ſhall not there
be any defect in the <hi>Scrutiny</hi> upon thar
ſcore.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the publication being
compleated, they ſet down in two or
three ſheets of paper the names of all
the Cardinals who have had voices,
with the number of the voices; to
the end, that when there is any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
they ſhould not be oblig'd
to make any new enumeration of
the Suffrages, which the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
might have mark'd and croſs'd
on the ſide of their names upon the
lines of the printed ſheet, of which we

               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:48490:37"/>
The two laſt Acts of the <hi>Scrutiny,</hi>
which are the filing and laying aſide
of the <hi>Billets,</hi> are performed by the
<hi>Junior</hi> of the <hi>Scrutators,</hi> who, after he
hath with a loud voice publiſh'd the
name of the Cardinal who hath the
Suffrage by a <hi>Billet,</hi> files the ſaid <hi>Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi>
with a needle provided for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
at the place where the word <hi>Eligo</hi>
is written. And after he hath ſo filed
all the Billets immediately after his
publiſhing them, he tyes a knot on the
thing, and then lays them aſide, either
on ſome part of the Altar, or on the
Desk of the <hi>Scrutators,</hi> or in an empty
Chalice.</p>
               <p>The third and laſt principal Action
perform'd at the Election of a Pope,
by way of <hi>Scrutiny</hi> is, in the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
called the <hi>Poſt-Scrutiny;</hi> which, if
the Election be compleated by the
<hi>Scrutiny,</hi> (which very ſeldom happens
by reaſon of the different Factions in
the Conclave) comprehends three Acts
or Circumſtances only, to wit, the
numbring of the Billets, taking a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
of the Suffrages, and burning
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48490:37"/>
the ſaid Billets. Bnt if the Pope be
not choſen by the <hi>Scrutiny,</hi> there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
remarkable Circumſtances in the
<hi>Poſt-Scrutiny;</hi> to wit, the <hi>Acceſs,</hi> the
opening of the Seals and Signs, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
made thereof upon the printed
ſheet, the examination or confrontati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Suffrages, the review of the <hi>Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,</hi>
and the deſtroying of them by
fire.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Acceſs</hi> therefore, which is the
firſt Act or Circumſtance of the <hi>Poſt-Scrutiny,</hi>
immediately follows the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
or laying aſide of the <hi>Billets</hi> of
the <hi>Scrutiny</hi> in ſome part of the Altar
or elſewhere, when the Election is not
compleated by the <hi>Scrutiny;</hi> otherwiſe,
if the Pope were once choſen, there
would be no place for the way of <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,</hi>
inaſmuch as it were of no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
as being introduc'd to ſupply
the defect of the <hi>Scrutiny,</hi> whereby,
as hath been obſerv'd, we ſeldom find
the Election compleated, by reaſon of
the diverſity of the Factions.</p>
               <p>There are obſerved in the <hi>Acceſs</hi>
the ſame things as in the <hi>Scrutiny,</hi> as
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48490:38"/>
well in reference to the manner of
filling the <hi>Billets,</hi> folding them, ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, carrying them to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
and putting of them into the
Chalice, as to that of numbring
them, and making publicatiou of
them, noting the Suffrages, filing
and depoſiting the ſaid Billets aſide,
ſave only that there is an obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of theſe circumſtances follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that the Cardinals go
and take their <hi>Billets</hi> in the Baſin of the
<hi>Billets</hi> prepar'd for the <hi>Acceſs,</hi> which
ſtands upon the Altar, as does that of
the <hi>Billets</hi> for the Scrutiny.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, that if a Cardinal be
unwilling to give his voice to any
one, (which he is at liberty to do) he
muſt remember, in the midſt of the
Billet, in ſtead of the Cardinal's name,
to whom he ſhould have given his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage,
to write down the word (<hi>Nemini</hi>)
To no body. Now it is to be obſerv'd,
that the <hi>Billet</hi> of <hi>Acceſs</hi> is to be fill'd
with the ſame ſignes; and ſeal'd with
the ſame Seals, and as the <hi>Billet</hi> of the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48490:38"/>
                  <hi>Scrutiny,</hi> upon pain of nullity of the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage
of <hi>Acceſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third is, that one cannot make
<hi>Acceſs,</hi> (that is, give his voice a ſecond
time) to the perſon of a Cardinal, who
had not had at the leaſt one voice by
the <hi>Scrutiny;</hi> nor yet to the ſame perſon
to whom he had given his voice by the
<hi>Scrutiny.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth is, that though a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
is not permitted to nominate ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
perſons in the <hi>Acceſs,</hi> as he is not
permitted to chooſe divers by the
<hi>Scrutiny,</hi> upon pain of nullity of the
Suffrage as well of the <hi>Acceſs</hi> as the
<hi>Scrutiny;</hi> yet is it lawful for him, to
give his voice by <hi>Acceſs</hi> to one of
many who had been nam'd in the
<hi>Scrutiny,</hi> though with nullity of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage,
provided he had elſewhere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
of ſome other a Suffrage, which
was not null.</p>
               <p>The fifth is, That there is no ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the Oath anew in the <hi>Acceſs,</hi>
in regard it had been done before, for
the <hi>Scrutiny</hi> and <hi>Acceſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:48490:39"/>
The ſixth and laſt circumſtance is,
that the <hi>Infirmaries</hi> are oblig'd to carry
to the ſick Cardinals, with the <hi>Billets</hi>
of <hi>Acceſs,</hi> one of the ſheets upon which
they had marked the number of the
voices which every Cardinal had in the
Scrutiny, publickly and duly verify'd.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, third, and fourth Acts
of the <hi>Poſt-Scrutiny</hi> are, the opening of
the <hi>Seals</hi> and <hi>Signs</hi> of the <hi>Billets</hi> of <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,</hi>
the marking of it upon the ſheet,
and the examination or confrontation
of the Suffrages, which are practiſed
only when the Election is compleated
by the <hi>Scrutiny</hi> and <hi>Acceſs,</hi> and thus put
in execution.</p>
               <p>The chief <hi>Scrutator</hi> takes the <hi>Billets</hi>
of <hi>Acceſs</hi> filed, as they were upon the
publication of them, and opens only
thoſe which contain voices in favour
of the Elect, in the lower part of them
which comprehends the ſignes; then
after he hath exactly conſider'd the
Seals and the ſaid Signes, he preſents the
ſaid Billets as they are filed to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Scrutator,</hi> who alſo takes a view of
them, and then delivers them to the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48490:39"/>
third, who having made the ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
thereof, does, with a loud
and intelligible voice, make publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Seals</hi> and <hi>Signes</hi> of the ſaid
<hi>Billets.</hi> That done, he marks down
the Seals and Signes on the left ſide of
a ſheet of paper; where theſe words are
imprinted, and under the ſaid words
(<hi>Sigilla et Signa Acceſſuum,</hi> that is to
ſay, the Seals and Signes of the Acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes)
which remark may alſo be made
by all the Cardinals, if they think fit
ſo to do, upon the like ſheets which
they have lying before them, upon
their Desks.</p>
               <p>This done, the ſaid chief <hi>Scrutator</hi>
takes the <hi>Billets</hi> of the <hi>Scrutiny</hi> from
the place where they had been depoſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in order to the making of an exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
or confrontation of the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages
which they contain, with thoſe
which are brought in by the <hi>Billets</hi> of
<hi>Acceſs.</hi> And beginning the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at one of the ends of the ſtring, on
which the <hi>Billets</hi> are filed, he with the
two other <hi>Scrutators,</hi> views the Seal of
the firſt <hi>Billet</hi> of the <hi>Scrutiny,</hi> and then
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48490:40"/>
ſeeks it out in the ſheet, upon which
the Seals and Signes of the <hi>Billets</hi> of
<hi>Acceſs</hi> were marked. If he find it not
there, leaving that firſt <hi>Billet</hi> of the
<hi>Scrutiny,</hi> he proceeds to the examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the ſecond, taking a view again
with the other <hi>Scrutators</hi> of the Seal,
and then ſeeks it upon the ſame ſheet,
where not finding any thing like it,
he quits the ſaid <hi>Billet,</hi> to paſs on to the
examination of the third, and ſo of all
the other <hi>Billets,</hi> till he meet with the
Seal of ſome one of the <hi>Billets</hi> of the
<hi>Scrutiny,</hi> mark'd on the ſaid ſheet. But
having found it, he opens the ſaid <hi>Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi>
at the lower part where the ſignes
are written, to ſee whether the Signes
of the ſaid <hi>billet</hi> are anſwerable to the
ſignes marked upon the ſaid ſheet:
which if they are not, he there quits
the billet, and proceeds to the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the next, and if he find the
ſignes to be anſwerable and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to thoſe of the <hi>Acceſs,</hi> marked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſaid ſheet, he ſhews them to the
ſecond and third <hi>Scrutators,</hi> who all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
after they have maturely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48490:40"/>

as hath been obſerved before. But as

               <p>The fifth Act of the <hi>Poſt-Scrutiny</hi>
is, the enumeration of the Suffrages
either of the <hi>Scrutiny</hi> alone, or of the

made by the <hi>Scrutators,</hi> whether the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
enſue thereupon or not; if it

may be known in that very <hi>Scrutiny,</hi> or
in the <hi>Scrutiny</hi> and <hi>Acceſs</hi> together,
whether the Pope be not choſen; and
if the Election do enſue, that it may

               <p>Now the enumeration of the Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

the Suffrages which they have obtain'd,
who were named either in the <hi>Scrutiny</hi>
alone, or in the <hi>Scrutiny</hi> and <hi>Acceſs</hi>
jointly; and if they ſiad, that not any
one of the perſons named, hath got
two thirds of the Suffrages of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals,
there is no Election at that
time. But if, on the contrary, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
that any one of the ſaid nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
perſons hath got juſt the two
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48490:42"/>
thirds and no more of the Suffrages,
they, in that caſe, open the billet of
him who is choſen, at the part where
his name ſtands; which is the upper
part of the billet, to ſee whether he
hath given himſelf his own Suffrage,
which if he hath, the Election is null'd,
according to the <hi>Gregorian</hi> Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by reaſon of the want of one Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage,
it being not in his power to
give himſelf his own upon pain of
invalidity; but if he hath given it to
another, and that he have two thirds
of the Suffrages the Election is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated.</p>
               <p>Moreover, if it ſhould happen, that
ſeveral perſons had obtain'd the two
thirds of the Suffrages, or poſſibly
ſome number exceeding the two thirds;
in ſuch caſe, through the parity and
concurrence of the Suffrages, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
would be null; but, if there be
an inequality, he who ſurpaſſes the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

The fixth Act of the <hi>Poſt-Scrutiny</hi>
is the review which is made, whether
there be any Election or not, by the
<hi>Commiſſaries,</hi> drawn out by lot, to the
number of three Cardinals, whom the
Bulls call <hi>Recognitors,</hi> who take cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance
of, and look over, as well
the <hi>billets</hi> of the <hi>Scrutiny</hi> and <hi>Acceſs,</hi> as
the notes and marks of the Suffrages
made by the <hi>Scrutators,</hi> to verifie and
confirm what they have done, if
they have acquitted themſelves of their
Functions, with all the ſincerity and
fidelity whereto they were oblig'd.
The ſaid <hi>Commiſſaries</hi> are drawn by lot
after the ſame manner, as the <hi>Scruta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>
and <hi>Infirmaries</hi> had been; but ſtill,
after the compleating of the <hi>Scrutiny,</hi>
if the Election be made thereby; if
not, after the <hi>Scrutiny</hi> and <hi>Acceſs,</hi> as
ſoon as the <hi>Scrutators</hi> have finiſhed the
numbring of the Suffrages.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh and laſt Act of the <hi>Poſt-Scrutiny</hi>
conſiſts in the burning of all
the Billets, which belongs to the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the <hi>Scrutators,</hi> who caſt them
into the fire in the preſence of the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48490:43"/>
whole Colledge, immediately after the
review made by the ſaid Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
<hi>Recognitors,</hi> whether there have
been any Election, or not. All the
things before-mentioned ought to be
obſerv'd twice every day; in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
after Maſs; and in the Evening
after the Hymn of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and
this, till ſuch time as the Church is
provided of a Head and lawful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor,
which cuſtom hath been intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd,
to prevent the long continuance
of Conclaves.</p>
               <p>Thoſe perſons who pretend to make
aſſured judgments of Elections, are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times miſtaken in their Conjectures,
not only upon account of the diverſity
and claſhing of intereſts, but alſo by
reaſon of the ordinary alterations hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in the Colledge of Cardinals, by
frequent promotions, which ſtrangely
invert the courſe of all proceedings in
the Conclave, and deſtroys all the
former meaſure which might have
been taken of an Election.</p>
               <p>Let not therefore any be over-poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
as to what they aſſert, in a matter
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48490:44"/>
ſo uncertain, and which finds ſo much
exerciſe for the wits of the Citizens of
<hi>Rome,</hi> whom the Air of the Countrey
ordinarily entertains in a certain lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhment,
whence it comes that they
ſpend the beſt part of their time in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative
diſcourſe, and political divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.
They for the moſt part
ground their reaſonings on certain
conſiderations of the time, when the
Vacancy of the See happens, and then
from the quiet or diſturb'd poſture of
affairs, draw their conſequences in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of a perſon to be exalted into the
Pontifical Chair in one ſeaſon rather
then another, according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the humours, and the vigour
and force of the perſon. Some again
reflecting on the length of the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Papacies, do commonly make
their Concluſions in favour of thoſe
Cardinals who are well advanc'd in
years. For the Sacred Colledge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wearied out with a long-continu'd
ſubjection to the Government of the
ſame perſon, takes reſolutions many
times to exerciſe a right which makes
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48490:44"/>
them conſiderable every where, and
cauſes them to be courted by Crowns
and Scepters, and the Princes, in that
caſe pitching their choice upon anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Cardinals. On the other ſide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
when it happens that, by reaſon
of the great Age of Popes, the See
comes to be too frequently vacant, they
endeavour to exalt into the Pontifical
Chair a perſon, who likely to reign
ſome years, may re-eſtabliſh and ſettle
the Affairs of the Church, which might
have receiv'd ſome prejudice by the
frequency of mutations, and ſo prevent
the troubles it would be to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
to remove themſelves from the
remote parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> once every year
or two, to be ſhut up in the Conclave.</p>
               <p>Moreover, as to the perſons whoſe
pretenſions are conſiderable to the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical
Chair, there is a conſideration had
of their engagement to the Kingdoms
and Provinces, where they had their
birth or extraction. Whence it is affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by ſome, that the chiefeſt perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Italians,</hi> nor the <hi>Tramontanes,</hi>
ought not to be advanc'd to the Papacy,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48490:45"/>
not only in order to the avoiding of
partialities, but alſo by reaſon of the
poſſeſſion, or rather uſurpation, which
the <hi>Italians,</hi> from the time of <hi>Hadrian</hi>
VI. are chargeable with, in having not
rais'd to the Papal Dignity, but ſuch
as have been of their own Countrey,
there having been from his time eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
or nineteen Popes of the ſeveral
Provinces of <hi>Italy,</hi> who have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively
fill'd the Chair of St. <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is by ſome inſiſted on further,
that, to be a ſubject fit for this eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he have not many Relations and
Friends, that he may make the greater
communications of his Grandeur, and
that his benefits being not wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted
upon his own Relations, he
may exerciſe greater liberalities to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
many others.</p>
               <p>There are yet ſome among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
guilty of a ſuperſtition, which
argues them not fully clear'd from the
Augural humour of their Anceſtors.
Theſe diſcover ſuch an exceſs of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
as, by a kind of <hi>Onomancy,</hi> to
ſearch out of the names of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48490:45"/>
ſome conjectures of their ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
and this out of a perſuaſion,
that a ſubject, who ſhall not have in
the name of his houſe the letter <hi>R.</hi>
when the deceas'd Pope had not the
ſaid Letter in the name of his Houſe,
will hardly be choſen Pope; and on
the other ſide, that if the ſaid deceas'd
Pope had the ſaid letter in the name of
his Houſe, the Cardinal who ſhall in
like manner have it in his, can hardly
be advanc'd to the Papacy; by reaſon
of an alternate ſucceſſion of the names
of Families, having, and not having
the ſaid letter <hi>R.</hi> which hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
to have happen'd without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
during about fourteen Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
to the Papal Chair.</p>
               <p>There are yet others ſo weak, as not
to content themſelves with this kind of
ſuperſtition, but they muſt go and
pick matter of divination, out of the
brazen gates of St. <hi>Peter'</hi>s Church,
which they conſult as Oracles, by the
over-curious Re-ſearches they make,
amongſt the diverſity of Figures,
whereof they are full, for the Armes
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48490:46"/>
of thoſe Cardinals who aſpire to
the Papacy. And ſo their preſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
are in his favour, whoſe chance
it is to have his Armes graven in
ſome part thereof, and this upon
no other account then that thoſe of
the laſt deceas'd Popes have been
found there, which the People im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after their Election have
made the more remarkable by their
poliſhing and clenſing. True it is,
that there are many of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Cardinals, whoſe Armes
may partly be found amongſt the
numerous multitude of Figures in
the ſaid Gates, but without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of the Artiſt by whom they
were caſt.</p>
               <p>But quitting theſe vain ſuperſtitions,
we affirm further, that how ſtrong
and conſiderable ſoever their reaſons
may be for the judgment they make
of an Election, it happens that they
are for the moſt part miſtaken. This
diſappointment proceeds from the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
hapning in the Conclaves, where
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48490:46"/>
parties and Factions are made, for
the excluſion or incluſion of ſubjects,
according to the variety of humours,
affections and engagements. And as
it is the deſign of every Faction
to oppoſe the Elevation of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
contrary thereto, ſo is it the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
of it to be aſſur'd of a third
part of the voices in order to the
framing of Excluſions, wherein it
is no hard matter to have their
deſire, by reaſon there is not any
Cardinal that aſpires to the Papacy,
and hath the Qualifications before
requir'd, but will readily joyn with
all thoſe who would exclude a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
who might conteſt with him
for the Dignity. And thence it for
the moſt part comes to paſs, that
they who are thought to ſtand
faireſt for the Chair, are always
moſt eaſily excluded.</p>
               <p>The Factions moſt ordinarily fram'd
in the Conclaves, are commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible
to two or three principal ones,
all the reſt joyning with the former,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48490:47"/>
according to the different intereſts
which they may have in the incluſion
or excluſion of the ſubjects propoſed.
The Nephews of the deceas'd Popes
are the ordinary heads of Factions, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whom the Creatures of their Uncles
have a certain dependence, and concur
with them for the exaltation of thoſe
whom they are inclin'd to, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
of all others, not creatures of
their deceas'd Uncles, eſpecially when
by reaſon of their long ſitting in the
Chair, they had the opportunity to
make a great number of promotions.
And this is done, to avoid the reproach
of not having made choice of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
worthy to be advanc'd to ſo high
a dignity, and of being expos'd to the
inquiſitions and inſpections which a
Pope, not being of their Creatures,
might make into their adminiſtration
of affairs. The Cardinals Protectors
of Crowns are alſo Heads of Factions,
to prevent the elevation of a ſubject,
whom they ſuſpect, or to promote to the
Papacy ſome Cardinal well-affected to
their intereſts. Thoſe Sovereigns
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48490:47"/>
whoſe intentions incline moſt to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
and moderation, wiſh only a
Common Father; and yet all many
times under that pretence proſecute
their own particular advantages.</p>
               <p>There are alſo Brigues and Factions
upon a National Account, as that of
the <hi>Roman</hi> for inſtance, ſo as not to
conſent to the election of any one to
be Pope, unleſs he be a <hi>Roman.</hi> Thus
it happen'd at the Conclave upon the
death of Pope <hi>Urban</hi> VIII. at which the
lately deceas'd <hi>Innocent</hi> X. a <hi>Roman</hi>
born was choſen. Nay, there are ſome
Factions which carry on their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes
with that ſubtilty and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
on the other Factions, that they
make no publick profeſſion of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
themſelves for any in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
and to follow their own inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for the advancement of ſuch as
are propos'd to the Papacy; and ſo vote
for thoſe whom they in their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
think worthy of that Dignity.
Theſe are eaſily induc'd to joyn with
any of the others, either for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
of thoſe whom they think un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48490:48"/>
of that Elevation, or to give
their Suffrages with thoſe whom they
think ably qualify'd to maintain with
reputation the dignity of Head of the
Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>This diverſity of Factions when
they are of equal ſtrength, ſo as the
voices are equally parted, is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
the cauſe of the long continuance
of Conclaves. For being equally in
a capacity of excluding the ſubjects
propos'd of either ſide, and each of
them promoting the elevation of thoſe
whom they are inclin'd to, the Heads
of the ſaid Factions make it their on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
buſineſs to hinder the Cardinals of
their party, of whoſe voices they
think themſelves aſſur'd from ever gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their ſaid voices in the <hi>Scrutiny,</hi>
to any of the ſubjects propos'd whom
they would exclude. And the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
in this is, that the ſaid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
ſubjects wanting ſtill above a
third part of the Suffrages cannot
be choſen Popes againſt their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
as it might happen by the
<hi>Acceſs,</hi> if any of the ſaid Cardinals
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48490:48"/>
of the contrary party had given them
their voices in the <hi>Scrutiny.</hi> And
hence it comes, that there are very
few inſtances of any Pope choſen by
the way of the <hi>Scrutiny</hi> alone.</p>
               <p>But whereas none of the ſaid Head-Factions
can be fully aſſur'd of the
voice of a Cardinal, by reaſon of
the ſecret of the <hi>Scrutiny,</hi> which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the diſcovery of thoſe who may
change parties, and that whatever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
any Cardinal may have
made to the ſaid Head Factions, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by word, oath, promiſe, or upon
the ſcore of gratitude, affection, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe:
he is diſpenc'd from it by
the late Bulls of <hi>Gregory</hi> XV. and <hi>Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi>
VIII. beſides the precautions
there are, that he be not ſuſpected
of having been wanting to his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,
whereof he may avoid the
blame and reproach by means of the
ſecret of the <hi>Scrutiny,</hi> it happens many
times; that the ſaid leading Factions are
miſtaken in the computation of their
Suffrages, and they want voices, yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
diſcover whence that want proceeds
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48490:49"/>
and when they think themſelves the
moſt aſſur'd of an excluſion, one or
two of their own Partizans having
chang'd their humour or inclination,
oither upon ſome diſguſt receiv'd, or
greater hopes of eſtabliſhment elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
or other private conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and transferring their Suffrages to
another party, ſome other is choſen
Pope, who 'twas imagin'd would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have attain'd that dignity.</p>
               <p>And whereas many among them, to
prevent the elevation of ſuch as they
ſuſpect, beſtow their Suffrages, as it
were, at random on ſome other Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals,
whom they preſume not fit to be
advanc'd to the Pontifical Chair, it
happens ſometimes that ſome one is
choſen Pope, who had not been thought
of before; ſo that what may be moſt
ſecurely affirm'd of theſe matters is,
that we cannot make any certain judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Elections; and that, through
ways wholly oppoſite to thoſe which
humane policy had contriv'd, a more
tranſcendent wiſdom preſiding over
theſe great diſpenſations, diſpoſes of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48490:49"/>
them quite otherwiſe, and turns and
winds the ſpirits of thoſe concern'd
therein correſpondently to thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes
which it hath from all eternity
over the conduct of the Church.</p>
               <p>Aſſoon as any one is choſen Pope,
the two principal Deacon-Cardinals
conduct him from the place where
they find him behind the Altar, where
they veſt him with the black Caſſock,
the Roquet, the Camail, and the red
or white Calotte or Cap, according to
the ſeaſon, and put on his Slippers or
Pantofles with the gilt Croſs on them;
they then bring him before the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
and ſet him in a Chair, where all
the Cardinals come to adore him, that
is to ſay, kiſs his feet, hands and cheek.
Thence he is carried to St. <hi>Peter'</hi>s
Church, where he is ſeated on the high
Altar, and the Cardinals render him
again the ſame Homage: then the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
of the ſaid Church come up to
kiſs his feet: and then he is carried
to the ordinary apartment of the Popes,
and the Cardinals retire to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:48490:50"/>
The firſt thing that is broken about
the Conclave is that part of the walls
which ſhuts up the Lodg of the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
over the Portal of the Church;
There the principal Deacon-Cardinal
goes and places the Croſs, and cries
out to the people <hi>Vivat N.</hi> who is made
Pope, and hath aſſum'd the name
of <hi>N.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some days after the Pope is crown'd
in St. <hi>Peter'</hi>s Church. To that end,
the Cardinals, the Embaſſadors of
Princes, and the principal Lords about
the Court wait on him at his Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whence they accompany him to
the Church, and even into the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
whether he is carried in a Chair.
There he is clad in his Pontifical ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
and at his coming out thence, he
aſcends a portable Theatre, upon which
ſtands his Pontifical Chair, and is ſo
carried up to the Altar, croſs the
Church, then ordinarily full of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
aſſembled to ſee that Ceremony.
Nay, in ſome parts of the Church,
there are Scaffolds ſet up for the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Lords and Ladies of eminent
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48490:50"/>
quality, who are deſirous to be
Spectators of that celebrious Action.
He is preceded by the Cardinals and
Embaſſadors, while all the people
kneeling echo out their acclamations
of <hi>Long live Pope N.</hi> Juſt at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of the Sacriſty, and his going
up the ſaid Theatre, is performed the
Ceremony of ſetting fire to Flax faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
at the end of a ſtick, and held up
as high as his perſon, with theſe
words, <hi>Sancte Pater, ſic tranſit gloria
mundi; Holy Father, thus does the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the world paſs away,</hi> as an adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement
to him, that he ſuffer not his
heart to be ſurpriz'd with vanity, at
that Elevation, while he ſees all the
people under his feet. In the midſt
of the Church the ſame Ceremony
is reiterated, and is again performed
a third time, when he is come up to
the Altar.</p>
               <p>Being come down from the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre,
he ſays a Pontifical Maſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
the moſt eminent amongſt the
Embaſſadors or Princes, who had
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48490:51"/>
accompany'd him, miniſter to him at
the waſhing and preſenting the Towel.
At which Maſs there are ſome extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
prayers ſaid, as we find them in
the Ceremonial. The Maſs ended, he
is carried to the Lodge of Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
where in the Preſence of all the
people then aſſembled, in the ſpacious
place of S. <hi>Peters,</hi> the Chief Deacon-Cardinal
takes off his Mitre, and ſets
on his head the three Crowns, or Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-Crown,
telling him, that he is to
conſider himſelf from thenceforward
as the Common Father of Kings and
Princes, for the maintenance of Peace
amongſt them. That done, he gives
the Benediction, and is afterwards car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
back to his Apartment.</p>
               <p>There is yet another thing he is to
do after his Coronation, which is to go
and take poſſeſſion of his Biſhoprick,
which is St. <hi>John</hi>'s of <hi>Lateran.</hi> To do
that, he appoints what day he thinks
fit. The ſtreets through which he is
to paſs are hung with Tapiſtry, and
there are ſome Triumphal Arches e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
repreſenting the moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48490:51"/>
Actions of his <hi>Holineſs</hi>'s life. And
this is the order of the Cavalcade and
Proceſſion.</p>
               <p>Four light Horſemen of the Guard
go firſt to clear the way, then come
the Carriers of the Valiſes and Mails
belonging to the Cardinals, then the
Judges and Fiſcalls of the Covernour
of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Gentlemen of the Retinue
of the Cardinals; Then all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and <hi>Roman</hi> Lords, who ordinarily
go confuſedly, to avoid conteſting about
precedence, and have belonging to
them a great number of Pages and Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berdiers
ſumptuouſly cloath'd. Then
follow the ordinary Gentlemen of the
Pope's Houſe in Scarlet Robes. Then
the white Gennets preſented every year
by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> by way of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
for the Kingdoms of <hi>Naples</hi> and
<hi>Sicily,</hi> are led one after another, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their Harneſs of Crimſon-Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet,
with fringes of gold, and boſſes of
ſilver; then come the white Mules,
and three Litters, one of Scarlet, and the
others of Crimſon-Velvet both within
and without, and gold fringes. Then
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48490:52"/>
the Pope's Trumpeters; his Taylor
carrying his Valiſe; and the ten Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of the Palace; the <hi>Conſiſtorial
Advocates</hi> in Garments of a violet-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
furr'd with Ermine about the
neck: all the honorary <hi>Camerarii</hi> in
violet Caſſocks and ſcarlet Cloaks,
four of whom carry at the end of a
ſtaffe, every one of them, a Hat of the
Pope of Crimſon Velvet, with frin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of gold. Then follow ſeveral <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Gentlemen, who have been <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervators</hi>
(that is to ſay, <hi>Conſuls</hi>) in
their Garments and Caps of black
Velvet, and after them the Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Prelates in black Garments. The
Auditors of the <hi>Rota</hi> in their ordinary
habit, the Maſter of the <hi>Sacred</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
who is always a <hi>Jacobin</hi>-Frier,
the Embaſſador of <hi>Bologna</hi> and <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara,</hi>
the Captains of the ſeveral Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Rome,</hi> richly clad, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
of them, whom they call their
<hi>Prior,</hi> is in a Garment of Cloth of
Gold, marching between the two
Chancellors of the <hi>Roman</hi> people;
Then the three Conſervators of <hi>Rome</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:48490:52"/>
in Veſts of Cloth of Gold, and Caps
of black Velvet, and their Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloathes
with fringes of Gold; On their
left hand do ordinarily march the Chiefs
of the houſes of the <hi>Urſini'</hi>s and the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="3+ letters">
                        <desc>•••…</desc>
                     </gap>i</hi>'s,
or one of them, when they cannot
agree about precedence; Then come
the Embaſſadors, and after them the
Croſs-Bearer, and with the Croſs of
his Holineſs, the four Maſters of the
Ceremonies, with red Caſſocks and
violet Cloaks; fourſcore <hi>Eſtaffiers</hi> of
the Pope's, for he is oblig'd at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Papacy to take all the
moſt ancient Standers among the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaffiers
of the Cardinals and Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors
of Crowns, whom they call <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freniers,</hi>
to diſtinguiſh them from the
<hi>Eſtaffiers</hi> of perſons of a lower rank,
(as in <hi>France,</hi> they who are called
<hi>Lacqueys,</hi> when related to perſons of
of ordinary Quality, are named
<hi>Valets de pied,</hi> when they belong
to Royal perſons and Princes:)
Then follows the Governour of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and after him the Pope's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
when he has any, follow afoot,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48490:53"/>
and bare-headed. Next them imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
is conducted the Pope himſelf
in a cloſe Litter, having on each ſide of
him the two grand Overſeers of the
High-ways, clad in black, on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
and bare-headed, and all thoſe
who march between the Pope's Croſs
and his Holineſs, what condition or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
ſoever they be of, are oblig'd to be
uncover'd.</p>
               <p>After his Holineſs follow all the
Cardinals mounted on their Mules, the
Patriarchs, Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops and
other Prelates, two and two, every
one according to their Quality: and
the whole Pomp is brought up and
clos'd by the two Companies of the
light Horſemen of his Holineſs's Guard,
armed cap-a-pied.</p>
               <p>Being come to St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Lateran'</hi>s,
the Pope puts off his ordinary Habit,
and puts on the Mitre and Hood, and
takes up his Seat in a Throne which
is prepar'd for him in the entrance of
the Church, where the Canons of it
come and kiſs his feet. Then he goes
to the Church-door, which he finds
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48490:53"/>
ſhut; They give him the Key to open
it; <hi>Te Deum</hi> is ſung, after which the
Pope aſcends into the place of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
whence he gives it to all the
people aſſembled below.</p>
               <p>As all the Pope's Tribunals ceaſe
during the vacancy of the See, ſo they
begin not their Functions again till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Pope's Coronation, upon which
all Affairs reaſſume their ordinary
