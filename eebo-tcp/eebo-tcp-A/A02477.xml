         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But on the other part what I shal

can be so ignoraunt, but hée maye easilye
ghesse. Once, money I gaine none at this
time, either for writing altering or correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

that bothe I and my booke may be bould to
exempt our selues from the reache of mine
owne Argument which consisteth in the
reproouing of those who (by <hi>male engine</hi>) lie
in wait for sir <hi>Nummus.</hi> And thus much be
spoken to preuent the obprobry &amp; reproche
that this way might be raysed against me.</p>
            <p>As for prayse and commendation, if the
sharpnes of my <hi>Satyrs</hi> were not matter
sufficient to settle me against the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof: yet I am not so farre from
Judgement I thanke God, but that I
<pb facs="tcp:6480:4"/>
know (in part) what is lackinge (aswell in
the inuention as in the verse of the booke,)
that shoulde carye away commendation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the better sort of english Poetes of
our tyme: And indéede, it is a matter that
I stryue nothing at all to attaine vnto:</p>
            <p>For if I did, I woulde frequent the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
which are reading and practise, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
whereof, I haue bene acquainted with
to any purpose since the first thrée yéeres
which I spent in the Innes of Chauncery:
being now aboue a dosen of yéeres passed.
And so longe is it sithens these Satyres
were first made and set foorth, euen (as I
maye saye) in my childishe yéeres, whereof
notwithstanding verye lyttle or nothing
I repent mée. Only I wishe that all that I
haue written &amp; published heretofore were
by me reuised, and that I might haue ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense
and laysure to runne them ouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
hereby to make them a little more
substanciall if my habilitye serued thereto:
which being once done and performed, how
forwarde I woulde bée from thensfoorth in
setting forth of bookes, shoulde appeare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the worlde by the continuance of my si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
For (to speake a truthe) it is not
méete we shoulde cloye the worlde with
<pb facs="tcp:6480:4"/>
to many bookes of weake handling: especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
whiles the learned trauailes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
labours of worthye wryters are
fayne to kéepe the doore (as I maye terme
it) or, which is more, to lie buried in sile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</p>
            <p>But touching this my booke: I haue not
abridged it of any one Satyre that was in
the first edytion thereof, neyther haue I
added vnto it any other whole Satyr: But
I haue enlarged here and there one, and
haue corrected y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whole booke in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
I confesse I coulde haue béene wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to haue increased the number by ij. or
iij. Satyrs at the least: Namely of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shreeues
and Baylliffs one: And of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
and Sompners or Apparitours
other twoo. Which offycers (if they all so
be) how they abuse the Subiects and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of this Realme at this daye, by intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Extortions bryberies trecheries and
deceyts, what whole Shier, and in euerye
Shier, what Cytie Towne or Uillage, is
not hable haboundauntly to declare? But
these, togither with the exquisite handling
of mine allowable Argument, I muste be
contented to omitte, as neyther hauynge
laysure, nor (through want of laysure) skill
sufficient to accomplishe the same: For I
<pb facs="tcp:6480:5"/>
tell you, it is no matter of meane ympor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce,
firste to searche and syfte owte the
wrenches and wyles, shyfts, practises and
deceytes that the lewde sorte of this people
(which I feare me are the greater number
of them) doe vse to gette money with. And
then hauing so searched and syfted them
owte from nooke to crooke, to sette foorthe
the same in apt and conuenient discourse:</p>
            <p>For which causes (gentle Reader) be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
and affoord me thine indyfferent
Judgement in this that I haue alreadye
done: And if thou finde therein any matter
or reprehension more fytte to haue bene
handled by men of grauer Censure and
more agréeable callinge: Forasmuche as it
reacheth no farther then to the reprouing
of vice, and the same also wrytten in that
age of mine, when as vice (withoute the
grace of God) mighte rather haue drawen
me to her league, then haue had me for hir
enemye: I thinke thou mayest well
enoughe (without endaungeringe
of Justice) assent to my request,
and so I hope thou wylt

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ir, howe and in what wise</hi>
euery man shoulde beare him

time of health, in time of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie
and strengthe, moste
men knowe: yea, suche is the vntruste that
is in man, moe men can speake plausibly in
time of good happe, as we terme it, then in
time of siknes iudge vprightly. Alas, in time
of sicknesse and in assaultes of death (wherin
the bodye is not more greuously oppressed
then the minde diuersly distracted and the
soule mightelye assaulted) how fewe doe
consider, or at the leastwise, do apply them
selues to the relief of the poore afflicted soule,
to the strengthning of the féeble mynde, and
to the repelling of those bytter temptations
and assaults of the common enemies of man
kinde, the olde Serpente, the vaine, wicked
and vnconstant worlde, and the fraile, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
and rebellious flesh which alwayes
doe attend and attempt the sicke enféebled
<pb facs="tcp:6480:60"/>
and oppressed person? Surely, were it not
that God in time of suche extremitye dothe
mightelie comforte and confirme suche as
be his in the promises of his mercye, in the
death of his deare Jesus, and in the merytes
of his passion: it is not possible but that sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
shoulde be intollerable, death horryble,
Hel wictorious, the bodye liuing, to be a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
to the mynde, and the mynde so terrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and brought to desperation, to be the per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>petual
dampnatioun of the bodye and soule.</p>
            <p>Which thing considered, and from my ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
harte remembred, I cannot choose but in
this blessed battaile, and I truste (thoughe
somewhat sharpe and egre) yet most happy
conflycte whervnto (as a fellowe souldyer,
and adopted brother) you are called for your
tryall, I cannot choose I saye, but, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of your courage, endeuoure to make
plaine vnto you in all that I maye, the fruit
of affliction and the commoditye of death:
imparting with you suche weapons as for
mine owne store, the Lorde our Captaine
hathe alloted vnto me, to the ende, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
conueniently appoynted, you may resist
and auoyde at all assayes, and become bolde,
valiaunt, constant and perseuerable to the
death. Touching which death, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:6480:60"/>
it be gréeuous to the fraile flesh, yet is
it moste ioyfullye to be receyued as an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
ende of all griefe, for why? it is the
beginning of Joye and perpetuall tryumph
wherevpon a certaine godly man wryteth.
<hi>If thou haddest a good conscience, thou wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
not flye death. And againe, why haste
thou pleasure in that wretched body, whose
felowshippe doth nothing els but violentlye
withdrawe and deteine thee from the king<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
come of euerlasting glorie?</hi> O cousen: what
else but a place of exile is the miserable bodie
to the Soule? And to what thinge else maye
this our lyfe more aptlye be compared, then
to an horswaie or stage playe where men do
assemble to behoulde sondrye feates, and
where euerye man laboureth in all that he
maye, to winne praise, promotion and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritye
after the ende of his tragicall part:
God onelye is permanent immortall &amp; euer
lastinge: All things else are transitorye and
subiecte to corruption. They be constituted

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e shall passe, for it was
made but for mans vse. The Moone, and the
starres shall perish, for they were created
but for the necessitye of man. Heauen and
<pb facs="tcp:6480:61"/>
earth shall decaye, for they conteine but a
place of exile and prison for the body of man:
yea, the body of man also shall perish, for it
is but as an enemy to exercyse the soule,
and to make it apte to apprehend by fayth,
the Joyes of heauen and crowne of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talytie.
Moste certaine (I saye) it is that the
frayle body shalbe resolued to earthe, &amp; there
shall sléepe till the soule returne vnto it, and
tyll the members be restored to their right
places. Wherefore, sithe earth and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is the ende of the bodye: yea, the end of all
things that were made &amp; created, and that
the same ende of the bodye is the beginning
of lyfe, wishe for death, wishe for a peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
departure, and finding the same, imbrace
it: saying in your hart: Come Lord, come Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
make haste and tary not: Come Lorde
that I maye be one with thée and coheyre of
the kingdome purchased with thy precious
bloud. Deere Cosen and beloued in the
Lorde, lette not longe sickenesse discourage
you, neyther be you in anywise perplexed or
gréeued with the lowe state and constitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of your body: And in and aboue all thinges,
let not hyndraunce in worldly affayres dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyet
you. As you haue begonne, so further
the will of the Lord, and be ready to receiue
<pb facs="tcp:6480:61"/>
whatsoeuer he wil lay vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you. For the gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
affliction &amp; misery that man may or doth
suffer in this lyfe, is not worthie the leaste
of those treasures which God will bestowe
vpon him in the lyfe to come, which is dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
permanent, glorious &amp; altogither full of
blessednes. And assure your selfe (for so God
hath promised, and wyll not goe one iote
from his worde) that he wyll laye no more
vpon you, then by his grace and strengthe
you shalbe able to heare, althoughe he séeme
somewhat sharply to correct you, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
seuerely to deale with you: for who is
he whome the Lorde chasteneth not? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
surely, whome he loueth, the same dothe
he chasten, &amp; in him is he delighted as the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in his son, offering himself vnto him as
a déere father to his sonne: whereas if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
chastycement, we are no sonnes, but ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stards,
and not inheritable by any right. <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi>
was afficted and delyuered by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Lord.
<hi>Dauid</hi> was chastised, and he acknowledged
the Lorde and founde reliefe in his Soule.
<hi>Tobias</hi> was corrected, and he founde health.
<hi>Iob</hi> was tryed &amp; was made perfect. What
shoulde I say, euen all the Appostles, all the
Prophets: yea, and all the good men that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
were, haue bine tryed by affliction, cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
<pb facs="tcp:6480:62"/>
by persecuto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and crowned by patience,
abydinge the wyll and pleasure of God.
Wherefore, be strong in the Lord, &amp; desire of
him in your hart y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> his will may be wrought
in you, &amp; that you may with a glad hart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
whatsoeuer his Maiesty shal lay vpon
you. Assure your selfe that this your present
sicknes is either for punishment of sinne, for
exercise of your faith, or to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> death. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if it be for punishment, beséeche him to
giue you patienceand assure your selfe vpon
repentaunce, to haue frée &amp; full remission in
Christ: If it be for tryall, giue him thanks: &amp;
if it be to the death, reioise in it, &amp; thinke it is
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> greatest gift that euer he gaue you in this
world, being the very passage to the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
and Angelicall Paradice. And pray euen
from the bottom of your hart, that neyther
the loue of the worlde, nor the feare of the
same death, may distracte you from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of it. Be not carefull to leaue your kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folckes,
friends, and acquaintaunce, let it
not gréeue you to part from your goods, nor
haue any loue depending vpon any earthly
thinge whatsoeuer. As for your Kinsfolkes
and worldly friendes, at your Graue they
wil leaue you, and within a while after for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
you: and shortlye after that, shall dye
<pb facs="tcp:6480:62"/>
themselues, and be forgotten themselues al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.
Your goods wilbe fawning vpon other
men, assoone as the breath shalbe out of your
body: and euen as they serued you, so are
they readye to scrue an other, and perhaps
to his perdition, without the speciall grace
of God. To conclude, lift vp your harte, &amp; cal
together your wits, which are dispersed and
diuersely affected to things which are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible,
and fall not from God, for things
that are so deceytfull and vaine. A battaile
must be, no question: No triumphe is obtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
without fyghte, neyther any Garlande
giuen, but to him that manfully standeth in
the Lorde. If any sorrow be found in death,
it ariseth but of our owne infyrme or despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
feare: for death is but a swyfte flyghte
or passage of the soule fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the corruptible bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye,
rather to be desyred then to be fled from
of men. God is the rewarder of this conflict,
&amp; heauen is the eternal stipend. Wherefore,
let these giftes prouoke you to esteeme this
battaile the lighter: for chéerefully shall you
passe after death, into y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> pleasant Campes of
heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which place is conuenient for those y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
haue minded heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly things. The saints of
heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil receiue you as a friendly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of theirs into y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> portalles of cléerenes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb facs="tcp:6480:63"/>
you shall finde verye glorious abyding.
Thus shall you (at the last) come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
cares and from large continuing trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
into a peceable rest and mansion of qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnes.
In the Paradise aboue or like place
of pleasure among the departed Saints, shal
be your continuaunce, hauing all the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens
at your pleasure. A celestiall song wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
vttered at those recreations, and so swete
melodies as are able to mooue the Starres.
With the Saints, I say, departed hence shal
you lyue, and with them shall you raigne in
heauen with your Redéemer: so much glorie
hereafter shall you haue, and so muche hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlye
honour. What shoulde I saye? In
that place is eternall pleasure, and a lyfe
replenished with perpetuall felicytie: yea, in
that place shall the glorye of the Godhead be
reuealed vnto you, and séene with your very
eyes: euen with those your eyes of fleshe,
which from the foundations of the worlde
hathe bine hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from mankinde in this his
mortalitye. Fynallye, there shall you wayte
vpon the Lambe, your Sauiour Jesus, who
surelye loues you and reioyseth that he hath
saued you. God Cousen, assure your self that
in this blessed place you muste néedes bée.</p>
            <p>And that as surely as your Sauioure lyued
<pb facs="tcp:6480:63"/>
here vpon the earth, so surely you must and
shall raigne with him in the heauens. For
there is hée, there is that Sauiour your head
who can not nor will not be separated from
any of his members. As for the weight of
Synne, howe heauye, howe haynous, howe
huige and burthensome soeuer it be, caste it
all vpon him, for therefore he dyed, and not
for small sinnes onely, but for all the sinnes
that mankinde hath committed, doth or shal
committe from the begynninge of the
worlde to the ende of the same. It
is his onelye and greate glorye to be a
Sauiour. And for that cause is he ascended to
the heauens in our flesh, and will in no wise
deceyue those poore séely ones vpon the earth
that cling vnto him for helpe and saluation.
And whereas (haply) you may feare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the weakenes of your fayth, which
nowe in your extreame and laste bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle
(if so to be the Lorde haue appoynted
it vnto you) is diuerslye assayled and assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
Be of good comforte and plucke vp your
courage, for that méeke Sauiour wyll not
caste you of: no, he will not caste of his séelye
creature though he be hable to touche but
the hemme of his vesture. It is toulde vs
in the sacred scriptures that he will not
<pb facs="tcp:6480:64"/>
quenche the smoking flaxe nor breake the
bruised Réed. O, he is gentle, &amp; will make all
perfect that in the poore soule of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
He knoweth and hath felt how harde a
thing it is for poore man, to stande vpon his
legs, when he hath to deale with those ghost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and ghastly emmies: Sathan, the world,
and the flesh: but especially in the Agonye of
death. O how well acquaiuted, is he with
those conflicts? Feare not Cowse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, feare not:
If your faith be but as a graine of Musterd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>séede,
you shalbe saued. That Sauiour hath
said it. And as for those wounds and skarres
that these bloudy enemies haue made or shal
make in your féeble soule, that heauenly <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritane</hi>
shall binde them vp againe, and
shall supple them with the oyle of his grace,
so that they shall not hinder you a whit. He
will in no wise disdayne you, no: although
you were as fowle as a Leaper. For what
are they but sins? what are they (I say) but
sowle and lothsome sinnes that his precious
bloud hath washed and shall wash away in
mankinde, so longe as mankinde shall haue
place and abyding in the Tabernacle of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
flesh? He knoweth, yea, he knoweth and
that throughly, what poore man is &amp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he is made. And as he knoweth him, so he
<pb facs="tcp:6480:64"/>
pittieth him, and thereof hath giuen him a
a sure and euerlasting Testimony: For he
hath dyed for him: he hath dyed, (I saye) for
man, that man might liue with him for euer
be saued. In him therefore be comforted, and
vpon him only repose your whole confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
to the last gaspe of your life: say vnto him, if
not with a lowde and strong voice, yet softly
in your sick soule. Lorde Jesu receyue my
spirit. Come Lord and make haste. Into thy
hands Lorde I commend my spirit. &amp;c. And
so saying, waight paciently when he shall
come vnto you, and put a finall end to
your happy conflycte. To the same
Lorde, being God in Trinitye,
with the father and the holy
Ghost, be all honor praise
and glory eternally.</p>
