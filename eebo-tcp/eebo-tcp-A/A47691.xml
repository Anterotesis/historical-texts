            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am to speake a word unto you, since J have bin so long absent from you; It is no way in answer to the Learned Speech of Mr. Speaker: But yet J shall touch one point of it-concerning <hi>Ireland</hi>; But first I must tell you, though J have been absent longer then indeed J did expect, or could have bin expected by you, yet J stayed no longer in <hi>Scotland</hi> then the nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssity of those affayres would absolutely permit<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and indeed I have therein done so much good, that J will boldly affirme vnto you, that J have left the people a most contented and happy Nation; That if J did misreckon a little in time J doe not misreckon in the end.</p>
            <p>Now though J have deceived you a little of your expectation in point of time, J confesse you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived my expectation in finding of businesse here; for J had thought to have found things in quietnesse and settled both for Religion and peace of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but I found distractions, such as J could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, Jn so much, as the Parliament was thought fit to be guarded, this I speake not any way to seeke out a fault, or to have any distrust of the hearty affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:48370:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of my Subjects, but on the contrary when J came here (as you all see) J found the affection of my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vnto me, to my great comfort.</p>
            <p>Now I assure you, J come with the same affection that you or any good people of the world could wish, for I am so farre from disliking any thing that J have done hitherto, that if it were to doe againe (in the favour and good of my people) that I protest J would doe it againe.</p>
            <p>And whatsoever may be justly expected of me for the securing of Religion and Liberty of my people, I shall not faile to doe it, and therefore I shall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion no particular at this time, but onely that great particular of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which Mr. Speaker did men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of which I doe not doubt, but you have had a great care, yet me thinkes, things goe on slowly; and J mention this more reasonably, because a couple of Noble men are come out of <hi>Scotland</hi> according to the Petition and Jnstructions, which it pleased both Houses to send vnto me at <hi>Barwicke,</hi> which I instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dispatched to the Chancelor, who now have the disposing of all things, J spoke to them this morning, and I decreed both Houses to appoynt a select Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee and make an end of that businesse with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> have but this word more to say, that I assure you, <hi>I</hi> have no other end but the happinesse of my People, for their flourishing, is my greatest Glory, and their affection, my greatest strength.</p>
