            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>YOu noble Peeres, my natiue Countrimen,</l>
               <l>I need not shew to you my bloud nor birth:</l>
               <l>As dust I was, I turne to dust agen,</l>
               <l>I go before, but you must to the earth.</l>
               <l>Yet when, or how, to you it is vnknowne:</l>
               <l>For be you sure the earth doth claime her owne.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>It is not gold, nor treasures that are vaine, can you preserue when that the time is come:</l>
               <l>Your houses gay wherin you do remaine, can you not shield from Gods decreed doome.</l>
               <l>As I am dead, so like wise you shall die:</l>
               <l>But learn by death with me to liue on hie.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Though gaping graue inclose my Corps in clay, and silent I rest couered close in mould:</l>
               <l>Yet from my shrine Trueth striues both night and day, to you my mind (good Lords) for to vnfould.</l>
               <l>Whereto if case you vouch to yeeld reg<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

            <lg>
               <l>Which of you could with <hi>Hatton</hi> finde a clause, or say that he vniust or faithlesse was?</l>
               <l>Did he not liue according to the lawes? and on the earth his daies in duetie passe?</l>
               <l>Was not his care set on his God for aye?</l>
               <l>And did not he his soueraigne Queen obay?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Was not his hart bent for his Countries weale? did he not stil euen from his tender youth</l>
               <l>With rich and poore vpright and iustly deale, and cloath himselfe in robes of tried trueth?</l>
               <l>If this be true, as no man can denie:</l>
               <l>Fame saith he liues, although our <hi>Hatton</hi> die,</l>

Where he might help he would be helping still, where he might hurt he neuer would do harme:</l>
               <l>His chiefest care was to doe good for ill, thus God with grace did gentle <hi>Hatton</hi> arme.</l>
               <l>No trecherous thought could harbor in his brest:</l>
               <l>The fruites offaith in him were aye exprest.</l>

            <lg>

            <lg>
               <l>In lustie youth he lou'd the barbed steede, and <hi>Hector-</hi>like would breake the manly launce:</l>
               <l>For martiall acts surnamed <hi>Mars</hi> indeed was <hi>Hatton</hi> sweete, that manhood did aduaunce.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>At turney he and barriers did excell, some peeres in arms haue borne his battring blowes</l>
               <l>In court and towne he was beloued well, a scourge he was vnto his Soueraignes foes.</l>
               <l>Faith was the shield that worthy <hi>Hatton</hi> bare:</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Should Trueth then dread to spread his vertues out, that for his deedes hath wonne deserued praise?</l>
               <l>Her cheareful voice, with courage bold and stout, throughout the world his lasting laud shall raise.</l>
               <l>And moue thereby the minds of noble men</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Thus for his loue, his faith and tried trueth, he of the Guard, by our most gratious Queene</l>
               <l>Was chieftaine made, who firmly held his oath, from <hi>Hattons</hi> hart faiths fruites to flow were seene.</l>
               <l>A chieftaine kind he to the Guard was found:</l>
               <l>Whose want, with grief their tender harts doth wound</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He sought all meanes to wish and work their weale, to doe them good he took no small delight:</l>
               <l>In their cause he with our good Queen did deale, t'augment their wage he did all that he might.</l>
               <l>From sixteen pence, to twenty pence a day:</l>
               <l>Whil'st world doth last he did reduce their pay.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And by the day three moneths in the yeare, two shillings he for them obtaind indeed:</l>
               <l>Such feruent loue in him did still appeare, that they him found a fort in time of need.</l>
               <l>Their wrongs he sought by skil for to redresse:</l>
               <l>His loue with teares Trueth shows they can expresse.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>In wisdoms bower he did obtayn his seat, whose lore to learn he did his time imploy:</l>
               <l>And God from heauen with his graces most great, in mercies milde sought to augment his ioy.</l>
               <l>For vertues vse wherein he took delight:</l>
               <l>Our gratious Queen did dub our <hi>Hatton</hi> knight.</l>
