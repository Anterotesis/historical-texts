         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is an eaſie thing

thought to conceive, nor

the Spirit of God did
move or flutter upon the
waters for the inclining
of that vaſt body, by a
powerfull and procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
heate, ſo the heate of
Gods Spirit muſt either
quicken us to the duty, or
wee, and it are no better
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:15279:16"/>
then a deed Carcaſſe, or at
the faireſt but like a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Picture. The people
of God doe now and then
neglect (I muſt confeſſe)
this duty, the taking their
guide with them; they
weigh not ſo attentively,
nor watch ſo ſeriouſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this firſt mover, as
they ſhould: As a man
forgetteth to ſet his
watch, or to take his guide
with him. And this is a
main cauſe why they ſeek
and find not; yea, why
they walke not in the
ſtrength of the Spirit. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
the people of God
may be without the ſence
and feeling of the Spirit,
&amp; yet the Spirit be there,
they not being aware:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:15279:17"/>
howſoever they are very
ſenſible of their inſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and much humbled
for their neglect.</p>
               <p>The third evidence<note place="margin">3 <hi>A</hi> ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of our owne inability.</note>
that we pray by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is a ſenſibility of our
owne inability: As the
Spirit helpeth our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
ſo it diſcovereth
the infirmity of the un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derſtanding,
the will, the
memory, the affections;
yea, the Spirit diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
all indiſpoſition,
ſloathfulneſſe, impatien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
inconſtancy, and too

and blood cannot diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
theſe: Indeed fleſh &amp;
blood will diſcover want
of readineſſe, or of an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
frame of words, or
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:15279:17"/>
for want of ſome ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
heate to inliven
the outward action, which
the hypocrite may take
for the true heate of the
Spirit; but the want of
that coeleſtiall heate, or
true quickning motion of
the Spirit, it neither diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth
nor bewaileth:
But the godly out of
knowledge of theſe infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
are exceeding
humbled, whereupon
there is roome made
for the Spirit to reſt in,
for repairing of thoſe ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines;
yea, the child of God
by the knowledg of theſe
his wants, commeth to
ſpeed beſt, when in his
owne conceipt he prayeth
worſt, yea, when he can
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:15279:18"/>
ſay nothing with <hi>Moſes,</hi>
and is to himſelfe as it
were breathleſſe, and
ſpeechleſſe, yet out of the
ſenſibility of his prolixity
he cryeth hardeſt of all,
and God is nigheſt to
him, when he conceiveth
him to be fartheſt off: If
then thou findeſt or fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
not in Prayer that
comfort that thy heart
deſireth, be not diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
but rather comfort
thy ſelfe, upon the feeling
of thy wants, and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
for them, becauſe it
is a worke of the Spirit;
goe on then, and rather
then thou pray not at all,
caſt thy ſelfe before the
Lord, look up to heaven,
if thou canſt but cry like a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:15279:18"/>
litle child, ceaſe not till
thou make the Echo of
the Rock to reſound.</p>

                  <hi>The Spirit helpeth our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities:</hi>

in his due place, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the ſoule to pick ſome
good out of of every one
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:15279:19"/>
of them. So the Spirit
bringeth the wil in Praier
contrary to its diſpoſition
to be ſubject to the Will
of God, and to make
choice of that which God
willeth as the very beſt:
in this our Saviour Chriſt
is a perfect patterne, in

conflict, ſaying often and
againe:<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>Not as I will but as

doth not only correct
and change the averſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and deadneſſe of the
affections, as feare, love,
joy, and ſorrow, but it ſets
them on with a high and
heavenly temper upon
their proper objects; As
that the ſoule in Prayer,
ſhould love nothing in

compariſon of God, and
his countenance; hate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo much (no not the
Divell or Hell it ſelfe) as
his owne ſinne, grieve, at
nothing ſo much as the
grieving of God; fear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
as the God of his
feare.</p>
               <p>Laſtly the Spirit hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
the ſtupidity and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummedneſſe
of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,<note place="margin">Conſcience.</note>
making it tender
and pliable, and alſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall
in the applying
home of the particulars
to the preſent ſeate of the
ſoule, which is the proper
function of the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
As for inſtance, it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
excuſeth by applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of mercy, the fruit
whereof is preſent peace;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:15279:20"/>
or accuſeth by applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

fruit whereof is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

forth and begetteth
the quiet fruit of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe;
for upon the
judging of our ſelves by
the afflicting of our ſelves,
God ceaſeth to judge us.
Try then what helpe thou
findeſt of the Spirit, in
ſtrengthning thy weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in the ſeeking of his
face; for aſſuredly wee all
find the leſſe helpe for

               <p>But ſome will ſay, wee

               <p>I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſwer 1.</note> firſt there
may be a neglect of the
triall of the performance
by the ſeverall notes, and
alſo ſuch a careleſſeneſſe,
to walke by the rule of
Prayer, that the duty is
fallen into a cuſtome; ſo
that, becauſe we look not
to take the Spirit along
with us, and caſt not our

when we would, becauſe
we looked not for it when

               <p>Againe, it may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered

ſence is no true Iudge: For
as ſome may conceive of

help from the Spirit, that

and yet he helped mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>Firſt, the ſence of thoſe

               <p>Secondly, the going on
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:15279:21"/>
with ſighes and groanes,
under the burden of theſe
infirmities is word for
word, to take us up (as it
were by the hand) and to
goe with us againſt our

ſo purified by faith is a

fit lymbeck for Prayer.
Out of this the Prophet
<hi>David</hi> was bold to preſſe
his Prayer upon God;
<hi>Hearken to my Prayer</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 17. 2.</note>
                  <hi>that goeth not out of feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
lips,</hi> or without lips
of deceipt; by which is
meant the ſyncerity of the
heart, agreeing with the
words of the mouth: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo much adorneth
the heart as faith, nothing
commendeth faith more
then Prayer,<note place="margin">Eſay. 29. 13.</note> and <hi>nothing
graceth Prayer more then
ſyncerity:</hi> This (with the
proud Phariſee) all Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
want,<note place="margin">Mat. 15. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>drawing nigh

                  <hi>&amp; with their

him,</hi> or not firmly prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with him: And this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
maketh the Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Hypocrites of an
evill ſavour in Gods No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrills,
for as he is <hi>the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
of the heart</hi> (as one
ſaith) <hi>and not of the voice,</hi>
ſo he loveth the ſyncerity
of the heart, and hateth
the hollowneſſe and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſſe
thereof in Prayer
above all things, becauſe
they goe about to deceive
him, denying him in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
to be the diſcerner of
the heart; otherwiſe they
would never deal ſo with
him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:15279:41"/>
Try alſo thy hope in
Prayer,<note place="margin">Triall of hope and patience.</note> namely by clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of thy Author, and
caſting it within the vaile.
The nature of hope is to
keepe thee from ſhame,
by the repulſe of thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
becauſe <hi>the love of
God is ſhed abroad in our
hearts by the holy Ghoſt,</hi> in
ſuch abundant meaſure
and unſpeakable manner,
that he cannot deny us the
things hoped for. Try al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
thy Prayer by patience,
waiting on the Lord, and
going on in Prayer in the
time of diſtreſſe. This an
Hypocrite, as I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
cannot, nor will not
doe. In the time of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they wil ſet very freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon the duty; ſo farre
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:15279:41"/>
as great words will carry
it, but if they be brought
to any ſtrait, or put to
any hard ſhift, like white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
ſouldiers they die
down-right in their owne
ayre or element, or elſe
fling away their arms, and
run from their Colours.
It is much to be feared
that our nations woefull
experience ſhall teach the
truth of this in one as wel
as the other! But God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
his owne another
heart, namely to overtop
the height of their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
with the height of
their Prayers, and never
give over till by patience
and importunity they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe
the gates of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
and become more
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:15279:42"/>
then Conquerors: The
Scripture to this purpoſe
affordeth abundance of
remarkable inſtances, for
a touch whereof take
theſe two; <hi>Steven</hi> the firſt
Martyr being caſt out of
the City and ſtoned for
his worthy Sermon, as
the ſtones were flying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his eares, in the midſt
of all the miſchiefe that
they could doe him, by
the power of the holy
Ghoſt,<note place="margin">Act. 7. 55. 59. 60.</note> 
                  <hi>called upon God,
and that with cryes knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
upon his knees:</hi> This
leſſon no doubt hee lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
his Maſter Chriſt, the
beſt and only pattern that
any man can follow: He,
though a Sonne, learned
obedience by afflictions,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:15279:42"/>
in the dayes of his fleſh,
offered up Prayers and
Supplications withſtrong
crying and tears unto him
that was able to ſave him
from death, &amp; was heard
in that he feared: where
obſerve what force, feare,
and afflictions added to
our Saviours Prayers,
which as ſwelling ſeas
make well growne fiſh,
and thundring, and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
cleereth the ayre, and
the nipping froſt maketh
the fire the hotter; So the
afflictions of the Saints
addeth force to their Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
they cry more migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
to God then ever they
did, yea, where they could
not ſpeake before, now
they <hi>cry</hi> and that <hi>day
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:15279:43"/>

though he beare long
with them:<note place="margin">Luk. 18. 7.</note> where obſerve
the patience of the Saints,
they beare long in Gods
bearing with their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
Then obſerve their

cry day and night; to the
ſame effect the Lord ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
by his Prophet,<note place="margin">Zacch. 13. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>I
will bring the third part
through the fire, and will
refine them as gold is try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they ſhall call upon my

Affliction maketh the

them from God; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are a burniſhed
blade of terror in the hand

vaniſheth, ſo doth the
Prayer of the Hypocrite
by affliction; but the triall
of the godly bringeth
forth patience, &amp; driveth
them nigher to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their afflictions are
but trialls indeed, and at
the worſt they are but as
a rod in the hand of a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

Gods opportunities; ſo
the ſame extremities are
whetſtones to the Saints

               <p>Laſtly, as for prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
labour to ſet thy

                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:15279:44"/>
that is in faith, ſyncerity,

<hi>the Lord will be nigh

               <p>The ſeventh evidence
of Prayer made by the
Spirit,<note place="margin">7 The gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the Spirit in all our actions.</note> is the guidance of

For as he that is born

he is ſpirituall in all his

becauſe the Spirit is
of an all renuing nature,
though many remainders
of the fleſh, and much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctation

therewith throughout all

To this effect is
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:15279:45"/>
that of the Apoſtle, <hi>As

ſelfe-deniall: In a word,
the whole inner and the
outward man, is nothing
but a confuſed maſſe of
ſin: Can the ſpirit govern
&amp; guide ſuch a one where
there is nothing but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion

And if the Spirit beare

               <p>The latter particular
wherein the guidance of

of grace:<note place="margin">Quickning and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of grace.</note> for <hi>as by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,

                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 13.</note> &amp; therefore
is the ſpirit called the <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of grace:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Zac. 10. 12</note> Now the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of grace is joyned with
the ſpirit of ſupplication,
as the Cauſe and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible
Effect, the ſtate &amp;
the demonſtrative evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the ſtate: <hi>I will
poure out</hi> (ſaith the Lord
by <hi>Zachary</hi> in the place
quoted) <hi>the ſpirit of grace
and ſupplication or depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:</hi>
Where by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of grace is meant the
gracious ſpirit of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
proceeding from
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:15279:53"/>
the grace of God, guiding
and quickning his own in
all the waies of grace: &amp;
by the ſpirit of deprecati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that ſpirituall immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly
infuſed ability (as I
have ſhewed,) whereby
his penitents doe beg and
obtain pardon of ſin and
all other things condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
to Gods glory, and
their own good. Between
this ſpirit of grace, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation
there is a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
ſtrengthning or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboration:
As health is
the cauſe of walking, and
by walking is ſtrength aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
and increaſed; ſo
grace is the internall, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate,
conjunct cauſe of
prayer, and is alſo quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and ſtrengthned by
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:15279:54"/>
prayer: Or as the heat of
the ſun reflecting upon
ſome ſolid or impenetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
body, is made more
forcible; So the radiant
beames of grace, exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
themſelves upon that
firmly framed object of
prayer by a gracious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection,
they become out
of meaſure gracious. If
thou wouldſt then excell
in grace, labour to excell
in that eminent ability of
prayer, which doth not
conſiſt (as I have ſhewed)
in the excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy of words
but in the heigtht &amp; depth
of the grones of the ſpirit,
which no words are able
to expreſſe. Try alſo by
the gage or land-mark of
prayer, the ebbing or flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:15279:54"/>
of the tide of grace:
for ſo much as thy ſoule
is taken up with the true
ſtrain of prayer, ſo much
doſt thou gain in the rich
traffique of grace; and ſo
much as thou looſeſt in the
faculty of this heavenly
Oratory, ſo much thou
looſeſt in the ſtocke of
grace. Therefore for the
keeping of both ſtock and
intereſt on foot, it ſhall be
good, in my judgement,
to put theſe two particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
obſervations in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice:
Firſt look what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
ſin either of perſon
or calling thou art moſt
addicted unto; &amp; in what
patticular grace thou art
moſt deficient;<note place="margin">Meanes of keeping &amp; increaſing of grace.</note> labour to
countermand, and ſubdue
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:15279:55"/>
the particular ſin by the
oppoſite grace, and to
quicken &amp; ſtrengthen the
weak and decaied grace
by the ſpeciall or proper
remedies. This is the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
policy, the higheſt
point of war, the richeſt
trade, and the proper im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
of our precious
talent.</p>
               <p>Another remarkable
obſervation to be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
is this; Let no day
paſſe thee wherein thou
doſt not call thy ſelfe to a
ſtrict accompt, of the well
imployment, ill imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or miſimployment
of the day; record as neer
as thou canſt thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions
and omiſſions, in
thy calling or out of thy
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:15279:55"/>
calling, in thought, word,
or deed, againſt piety, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
or ſobriety; recall
thy company and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
thine or others pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting
thereby or unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitableneſſe;
recompt the
favours, the frownings,
the cheriſhments or cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements,
mercies or
judgements towards thee
and others as nigh as
thou canſt; obſerve what
corruption hath prevailed
againſt thee, or in what
particular grace thou get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
any better footing.
This courſe deſerveth
neither obloquie from
the wicked, nor ſhould it
ſeem unneceſſary, ſtrict,
or impoſſible to profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours:
For the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:15279:56"/>
by the guide nature
have given order for it in
their morals, namely, that
wee ſhould not ſuffer our

a leaden rule to walke by,
turning all their ſtricteſt

into gliſtring ſinnes! but
we have a golden rule of
trial, which by a true touch
will (indeed) turn us and
our actions into the pureſt
gold. It is a double ſhame

now if wee will

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:15279:57"/>
muſt be content to part

that men hereby ſhould
neglect their callings; for

the Prayers of the later
lean upon the broken reed
of ſomething within the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

namely, ſome

they caſt themſelves

the integrity of the heart,

               </p>
               <p>For anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> briefly, he
that hath promiſed to

us alſo to pray, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

               <p>Try then thy intereſt

laying hold, or deſiring

&amp; thereby thou maiſt
know, whether thou prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt

keep alwaies thine eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the promiſes; for as
the load ſtone keepeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
the point of the

ſo the load-ſtone of
Gods promiſes keepeth
alwaies the point of the
Prayer touched there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
directly towards the
Mercy ſeat of God: But
as the unregenerate man
hath no portion in the
promiſes, ſo the promiſes
are no point of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
whereby his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
are guided. It is true
indeed, that a wicked man
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:15279:65"/>
out of the darkneſſe of
his thoughts may charge
God with ſuch a promiſe
as God never made, by
miſconſtruing of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe;
as for inſtance,<note place="margin">His argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> (<hi>Call
upon me in the day of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe,
and I will releaſe

Thou haſt bound thy

               <p>The Argument is a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſme<note place="margin">Anſ.</note>
(as wee ſpeake)
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:15279:66"/>
from the <hi>homonumie,</hi> or

be taken for calling upon

for the wicked may
prate and bable, but hee
calleth not upon the Lord,
as I have ſhewed, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he hath no intereſt in
the promiſe: Hee leaveth
out the maine evidence,
namely, the Glorifying
of God, which a wicked
man never doth; ſo that
he preſumeth himſelfe to
doe that he doth not, and
God to promiſe that
which he never meant.</p>
               <p>Againe, a wicked man
may obtaine that which
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:15279:66"/>
he payeth for, as ſucceſſe,
honour, wealth, tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
deliverance, and the
like; whereupon hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth
of ſome intereſt to
the premiſes; but it doth
not follow: For as God
heareth not in every thing
or alwaies, the children of
the promiſe, becauſe they
are not fitted, or it is not
good for them, or the
the time is not come; ſo
he often giveth the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
things they crave, in
his wrath, they having no
ground to aske or receive
any thing from him, as a
promiſe to them; for they
are none of the children
of the promiſe: They
have neither promiſe of
the things of this life nor
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:15279:67"/>
a better; neither doe they
with patience waite the
Will of God, that they
may receive the promiſe;
but the childrens only
care is to make good to
themſelves ſome intereſt
to the promiſes, and that
by cleanſing themſelves
from all filthineſſe of fleſh
and ſpirit, and by doing
the Will of God, waiting
with patience for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
endeavouring to
bring them home by faith
and ſupplication without
ceaſing.</p>
               <p>The ninth Evidence of
the Spirit of Prayer,<note place="margin">9 the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of Prayer.</note> is
the directing of Prayer
to God in the name of
Chriſt: we are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
thus to doe; for what
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:15279:67"/>
is it <hi>to ſeek the Face of God</hi>
according to his owne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
but to ſeeke
him in the Face of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed?
Drawing neare
unto God in Chriſt, hath
only the promiſe of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
witneſſe Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
binding it with an
aſſeveration, <hi>Verily,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 25</note> 
                  <hi>veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I ſay unto you, what ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
yee ſhall aske the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in my name that will
I doe;</hi> By no other, nor in
no other can wee ſpeed,
but in and by him; what
other can appeaſe the
wrath of God againſt us?
Dare man by any other
ſhew his face in Gods
preſence? In the worth of
Chriſt only our Prayers
find acceptance with God
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:15279:68"/>
in him as in a golden Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,<note place="margin">Rev. 8. 34.</note>
all the Prayers of the
Saints come to be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant
and ſweet-ſmelling
odors: He is the only me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour
as well of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
as Redemption:
He is the Prieſt, the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Altar by whoſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
our Prayers come to
be a Sacrifice. Did there
ever any prevaile with
God but in his name? Is
there any way or acceſſe
but by his name? Hee is
that high Prieſt going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Sanctuary, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on his ſhoulders, and
alſo on his breaſt the
twelve precious ſtones,
repreſenting the twelve
Tribes, or all the faithful.
Hence it is cleare that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:15279:68"/>
goe not to God, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the name of Saints
and Angels; ſometime in
the name of Traytors and
godleſſe perſons! In the
name (I ſay) of their own
worth and merit: neither
doth any reprobate goe to
God in the name of Chriſt,
for Chriſt is no Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor
for him; <hi>I pray not for
the world,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 17. 19</note> 
                  <hi>but for them
which thou haſt granted
me; for they are thine.</hi> A
great rabble of the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate,
as Hypocrites,
carnall Goſpellers, meere
civill men, will tell you
they defie Popery; they
hold it foolery and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to pray to Saint or
Angell, and alſo robbery
to goe to God by them;
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:15279:69"/>
and therefore they ſcorne
it, they acknowledge no
other mediatour of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
but Chriſt Ieſus:
All this is wel ſpoken, but
what availeth this them?
They will tell you fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in Chriſt his name
they dayly make their
Prayers to God: This is
not ſo, for they have no
intereſt to take his name
in their mouths, or to
make mention of it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to be renued. It is true
they may ſpeake of his
name, and ſo egregiouſly
abuſe it, as they that will
alleage it in the great day,
that <hi>they propheſyed and
caſt out Divels in his name,</hi>
of whom he will <hi>profeſse</hi>
(that is openly proclaim)
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:15279:69"/>
                  <hi>he knew them not: viz.</hi> he
never acknowledged the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

them and biddeth them

ſo ſhall it bee with

               <p>The tenth evidence

vouchſafing him an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
hee commeth from
him to the Divell for an

then put it ſelfe to triall
upon this point, whither
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:15279:77"/>
doſt thou goe in thy trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles?
whereon doſt thou
ſtay thy ſelfe? doſt thou
be take thy ſelfe to prayer?
doſt thou walke with this
ſtaffe over the rocky, ſteep
and invious mountaines
of thy diſtreſſefull trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles?
Then thou talkeſt
by the ſpirit, thou walkeſt
by the ſpirit, the ſpirit
protecteth and directeth
thee; though thy feet ſtick
faſt in the clay, &amp; thy ſoul
be ſunk in the pit, the Lord
will take thee out, and ſet

thou ever with God in

be with thee to preſerve
thee; yea in life and death
he will never forſake thee;
and this ſhall be an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable
evidence in thy

that God is with thee:
But if thou canſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
in thy trouble, onely
to make thy triall of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,

preſent ſucceſſe to prefer

yet thou wilt uſe this but
as if thou uſed it not, then
thou dealeſt in this caſe
as <hi>Achas</hi> dealt with the

in</hi> (as the Hiſtory telleth
us) <hi>the Altar of Damaſcus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Kings from v. the 10. to 16.</note>
                  <hi>whereon all his offerings,
and the offerings of the
people must be laid; but the
Altar of the Lord muſt
haue an inferiour place, and
be reſerved only to conſult
withall a litle for faſhion
ſake;</hi> So though thou
canſt bee content to prate
with praier, having given
it an inferiour place and
reſpect, yet all thy ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are for the ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
meanes. As the Lord
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:15279:78"/>
abhorred <hi>Achas,</hi> and his
offerings, ſo will he never
look upon thee in this
caſe, nor on thy prayers
to doe thee any good:
Therefore looke to it as
thou loveſt to thriue: All
lawfull meanes (as I have
ſhewed) thou maiſt and
muſt uſe, becauſe the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of them is a tempting
of God, but be ſure to uſe
them in ſubordination to
prayer, by which they
muſt bee either ſanctified
or ſupported, or they will
prove but rotten and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull
reeds. But here by
the way, thou muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
a neceſſary Caveat,<note place="margin">Comfort for ſuch as cannot or dare not pray.</note>
that Gods deareſt childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
may bee ſo deaded with
diſtreſſe of ſoule, and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:15279:79"/>
of afflictions, that
they cannot pray, or, as I
have ſhewed, ſo diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
and diſtracted, that
they dare not pray; but
this may ſtay their heart,
that they would fain pray;
their heart beareth them
witneſſe, that they prize
nothing ſo much as pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
if they had all the
meanes in the world at
command, they will give
none the place of prayer;
yea they had rather pray
then be delivered. And
there is great reaſon, why
thus they ſhould eſteeme
of prayer, above all other
meanes, becauſe the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
thing that they can ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
is but hearts deſire,
in things like the meanes
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:15279:79"/>
themſelves: but prayer,
over and beſides, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
greater familiarity
with God, which is the
higheſt honour and the
richeſt profit, that the ſoul
can attain unto. A nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
inſtance wee have of
this in <hi>Daniel,</hi> who
though he underſtood by
holy Writ, that the time
of <hi>Ieruſalems deliverance
was come;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 9. 2. 23.</note> yet he fals hard
to prayer, and that to his
great rejoycing: for the
Angell of the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
the Herald of
the Lords affliction to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, calling him <hi>a
man of deſires,</hi> or as it is
tranſlated, <hi>much beloved</hi>
or <hi>deſired of the Lord.</hi> So
if thou haſt aſſurance of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:15279:80"/>
the thing deſired, yet
thou ſhouldeſt not ceaſe
to deſire it in prayer.</p>
               <p>It is further true, that
Gods deare people may
in the damp of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes
look more to the
ſubordinate meanes than
they ſhould, and leſſe to
prayer than they ought,
yea in this particular wee
may all lay our hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our mouths, and with
ſhame enough confeſſe
our faultineſſe. In this we
labour of the ſquintneſſe
of the eye of the ſoule; for
as this is cauſed in the eye
of the body from looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

from the weakneſſe

making us look a ſquint
upon that which ſhould

to that which cannot

removed, &amp; the ſight
being rectified they looke
ſtreighter and more dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly
upon the proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
or if you will, wee
may be compared to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſed
patients, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a direct and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
courſe of Phyſick, &amp;
not feeling ſuch preſent
good as they looke for,
they fall preſently upon
ſome Emperick medicin,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:15279:81"/>
either from a Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banck
Foe or an ignorant
Friend; the evill and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
whereof when they
begin to feele, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
their errour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
thence forth to walk
by the rule: So the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God in their brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
fits count with <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
the rivers of <hi>Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>

A few graines of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

were the people of God

now at length fall upon

hath taught how
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:15279:82"/>
our more relying upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
meanes than Prayer,
hath made God's Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
every where a prey
to the enemy: When the
troubles firſt began, wee
took them to heart; wee
began togather our forces
together, and importune
God; but God denying
his eare (it may be not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the faults of our
perſons and Prayers, but
alſo to try our perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance)
we quickly give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
leaving the cauſe and
the perſons as buried in
oblivion, caring litle or
nothing what become of
them or our ſelves: It is
no evidence of the Spirit
to begin to run, and to
break off in the mid way:
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:15279:82"/>
Naturall motions are the
ſwifter, the nigher they
come to their end. Is not
Prayer as powerfull as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it was to prevaile with
God? Have wee not to
doe with the ſame God
that heareth Prayer? De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth
he not to heare the

as ever he did? Are not
ſuppliants now the men
of his deſire? Hateth hee
not his enemies as much
as ever he did? Have wee
not the ſame command,
the ſame promiſe? And
ſhall it not find the ſame
entertainment? Yes veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
What is the cauſe then
the Lord is ſo farre from
us? Even becauſe wee are
ſo farre from him; we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:15279:83"/>
not to the mark, wee
turne backe in the day of
battaile; wee endeavour
not by <hi>wreſtling to stay
the Lord, and not to let him
goe til he give us a bleſsing.</hi>
And how ſhould the
Lord be intreated of us?
We are like to <hi>Iohas</hi> King
of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in our Prayers,
who <hi>ſmote the ground</hi> (as

not often enough, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the man of God was
wroth with him;</hi> for if hee

he ſhould have ſmitten the

wee ſhould have ſmitten

               <p>But to leave them in

and the promiſes of God
Chriſt Ieſus: Doeſt thou
deſire the loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Lord more
then Life it ſelfe, then let
this aſſure thee, though
thou want other aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
that thy deſires
are the deſires of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
for every deſire is of
the nature of the thing
deſired: Beaſts affect on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſenſuall objects, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their deſires are
meerly ſenſuall, and the

he may glance at better
things, which he neither

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:15279:91"/>
So the Kingdome
of God and his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
is the adequat object
of the ſpirituall mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,

or venemous,
humour, whereby they
long extremely for things
hurtfull, like the humour
it ſelfe, and deſire them
more then holſome food:
But as this is cured by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting,
ſo the Lord by
ſome croſſe or other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
out his malignant
menſtrous humour, after
which they come to hate
their owne deſires: <hi>David</hi>

but not when hee

perceive their inordinate

they ſay to them, as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi>

               <p>The laſt note of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the Spirit,<note place="margin">12 Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of the thing deſired.</note> is the
looking for an anſwer
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:15279:92"/>
from him to whom wee
pray: The end of every

A man can never intend

of Prayer is to be heard:

of attaining the ſenſe of the
Spirit in prayer:</hi> For as
many think they pray, &amp;
yet pray not at all; ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:15279:98"/>
pray indeed, and doe
not belieue they pray. As
it is the higheſt happines
of the ſoule to converſe
with God in prayer, ſo is
it the heavenlieſt conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ſoule, to know
it ſelfe to bee converſant
with God in prayer: Now
for the attainment of this,
thou muſt,</p>
               <p>1 Firſt ſtir up and quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the motion of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:
As in nature, Motion
ſtirreth up naturall heat,
and naturall heat maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
Motion, making the
part moved more ſenſible
of livelineſſe, and activity;
ſo the ſtirring up of any
ſpirituall faculty, maketh
it more active &amp; agile,
and the activity thereof
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:15279:98"/>
maintaines the vigor of
the faculty, and maketh
the ſubject more ſenſible
of its own activity: It is
directly ſo in prayer; to
this the Apoſtle is very
pertinent,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1. 6</note> 
                  <hi>Stir up the gift
that is in thee.</hi> The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of the word is to
ſtir up the ſparkles of fire,
covered as it were with
aſhes, and by laying fuell
to them, to kindle them
up, and make them burne
again. So that if thou
wouldſt feele the heat of
the ſpirit, thou muſt by a
devout indeavour &amp; care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
aſſiduity, gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
the ſparkles of the
ſpirituall motions, raked
up in the aſhes of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the rubbiſh of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:15279:99"/>
careleſſe neglect, and by
laying on the fuell of the
grones of the ſpirit, with
the ſoft breath of the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
of heavenly medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
thou muſt reſuſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
and kindle up againe
that ſpirituall fire, which
is like to be extinguiſhed.
The neglect of this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
want of ſenſe, and
want of ſenſe want of
comfort; and therefore
(as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
not,</hi> or be not careleſſe
of <hi>the gift that is in thee.</hi>
If ever then thou wouldſt
have comfort from the
ſenſe of prayer, dig thy
ſelfe out of thine own ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
dull not, neither
drowne thy pretious
thoughts in cares, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:15279:99"/>
worldly joyes, or
ſorrowes; be ever bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the diſperſed ſparkles
of the Spirit together, and
like a good workma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, look
well to the fire, and then
the Lord will not onely
take notice of thy prayer,
as he did of <hi>Pauls,</hi> but hee
will alſo give thy ſoule to
know, that it is ſuch a
prayer as he taketh notice
of; ſo that thou maiſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
averre with <hi>David,
I have called upon thee,</hi> &amp;
maiſt urge it with an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Pſ. 31. 18.</note>
                  <hi>let mee not bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 The ſecond Mean of
procuring ſenſe, is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
of hinderances,
as the diſtemper of the
body by intemperancy,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:15279:100"/>
the diſtemper of the ſoule
by paſſion, dividing cares
or looſe and unprofitable
company; theſe bee the
rubbiſh of our ruinous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition,
that keep us fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the view of the ſtraine of
prayer in us: Theſe be the
aſhes that cover the ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles
of the Spirit, &amp; keep
us from the ſenſible heat
of them. Away then with
theſe if thou deſireſt the
ſenſe of the vigor of the
Spirit! Firſt the ſoule fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
the temperature
of the body; thou muſt
labour, as much as may
be, for a ſound minde in a
well tempered body: The
over-wearied, and over-toyled
bodies, whereunto
moſt men reſerve their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:15279:100"/>
and ſecret duties,
are unfit to organize the
ſoule, or to vent the ſoul's
deſires in prayer; It is
good therefore to ply the
duty in health, &amp; ſtrength
of body, that hence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
may ariſe in time of
ſickneſſe, and weakneſſe.
As for the Paſſions or
Perturbatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the mind,
if they be the ſymptomes
of evill affected bodies,
the body muſt be brought
in frame; but if they bee
the more ſpiritual pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations,
or ſuch turbulent
commotions as wee call
properly the ſickneſſe of
the minde, as anguiſh, ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh
feare, ſadneſſe, &amp; the
like, theſe being of an aë<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall
and ſubtile nature,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:15279:101"/>
doe trouble and miſcarry
the temper, as the winde
doth carry the calmeſt
ayre and ſmootheſt water
againſt the rocks: So that
for want of ſmooth wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to move on (if you
will) a well-compoſed
minde, the evidence of the
Spirit, can neither be ſeen
nor heard. Therefore
theſe perturbations muſt
be alayed by their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite.
Graces, (as I have
ſhewed) not quite taken
away, with the <hi>Stoicks,</hi>
but they muſt bee ſo tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
and alaied by grace,
above the temper of the
<hi>Platoniſts,</hi> that they may
be as ſinews to the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Spirit, whereby
evidence may bee furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:15279:101"/>
and not hindered. As
for inſtance; an angry or
wrathfull diſpoſition, is
like choler, diſtaſting or
diſtempering the relliſh of
the Spirit; or as the unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
heat doth waſt and
conſume the naturall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
heat that commeth
from the heart; ſo the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
heat of anger ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
up the evidence of
the Spirit. <hi>The minde</hi> (as
one ſaith) <hi>must be at peace
in it ſelfe, if it look towards
God:</hi> But if the heat of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
be turned into a holy
zeal, tempered with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
it will conſume
that rubbiſh that lyeth in
the way of ſenſe, and will
be like a coach to carry
the evidence or feeling of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:15279:102"/>
the Spirit to our Spirit in
the time of prayer.</p>
               <p>Secondly, And ſo a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
of dulneſſe or penſive
heavineſſe, dulleth &amp; flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the ſenſe of the ſpirit
in prayer, but a well ſet or
moderate mournfulneſſe,
is that <hi>ſowing in teares,</hi>
which maketh us ſenſible
in prayer to <hi>reap in joy.</hi>
Laſtly diſtracting and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh
feare doth weaken
the ſenſe of Gods love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us, but a reverent
awe of the Majeſty of
God in prayer, will give
thy ſoule aſſurance, that
he is thy Father, and that
by the power of the ſpirit,
thou calleſt him ſo.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveall
of any reigning
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:15279:102"/>
ſin, I have ſpoke of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
for continuance in
that cannot ſtand with
the Spirit of prayer; yea I
am of that minde, that
though <hi>David</hi> loſt not the
Spirit by his ſin, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that he prayed not
ſcarce all the time that he
lay in his ſin.</p>
               <p>A third Mean to attain
ſenſe of the Spirit in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
is in thy diſpoſition to
the duty, and deſire to bee
guided by the ſpirit, and
not by the fleſh &amp; blood.
In thine indiſpoſition, or
averſe diſpoſition, it will
diſſwade thee from pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at all, and that upon
ſome ſhew of probable
ground, as that thou haſt
not the Spirit, thou canſt
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:15279:103"/>
not pray, God will not
entertain it, If any bee by
thou maiſt ſhame thy ſelf,
and bewray thee to bee a
man of no gifts; So thou
hadſt beſt let it alone till
thou be fitted, God will
accept of thy good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and better not pray
at all, then not to pray ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently:
But theſe, &amp; the
like be ſophiſticall ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions,
whereunto if thou
hearkneſt, thou neglecteſt
thy duty, thou weakneſt
thy prayer by thy neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
thou diſacquainteſt
thy ſelfe with God, thou
bewraieſt a doting on
thine own ability, thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepteſt
Gods opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of manifeſting his
ſtrength in thy weakneſſe,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:15279:103"/>
thou giveſt advantage to
Sathan, thou indangereſt
the very habit of prayer
as much as in thee lyeth;
for from frequency of
neglect thou maiſt dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh
the duty, or bring
it to a bare preſumptory
performance. Laſtly, there
is nothing that weakneth,
depriveth, and oppoſeth
ſenſe more then this: for
as a ſedentary life; or ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
after meat, bringeth
a fat cold body to a Palſie
or Lethargie, wherein
ſenſe and motion is often
weakned or deprived; ſo
the neglect of duty may
indanger ſenſe to a mans
dying day. Therefore if
thou canſt not pray as
thou wouldeſt, or as thou
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:15279:104"/>
ſhouldſt, pray yet as thou
canſt; God may bee there
and thou not aware of it:
and when thou art leaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
thou art moſt able; &amp;
when thou art moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
thou art fitteſt for
ſenſe: &amp; take this as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the Spirit in
many places beſides the
practice of the Saints:<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Pray
alwaies;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 4. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Continue in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 12.</note>
                  <hi>Watch and pray alwaies:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 21. 36</note>
The meaning of which
places wee muſt not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
(after the example of
<hi>Euchytes</hi> the <hi>Pſallian</hi>) that
we muſt doe nothing but
pray, (for many evills
would then ariſe) but that
upon all occaſions wee
ſhould have ſomething to
ſay to God, eſpecially as
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:15279:104"/>
both ancient and modern
obſerve, at the ſtinted
times of duty, which
though wee change, yet
we muſt not neglect or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
whether private or
ſecret. In a word, that of
the Apoſtle in another
caſe, though often by ſin
abuſed, will ſerve well
here,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 4. 2</note> 
                  <hi>Be inſtant in ſeaſon
and out of ſeaſon;</hi> that is,
whether it pleaſe or pleaſe
not: So whether thou art
diſpoſed or not diſpoſed,
goe to, and doe it; the
Lord hath bidden thee.</p>
               <p>The fourth Meane in
Prayer to obtaine ſence, is
the labouring in Prayer
to bring home Chriſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
to the ſoule: This is
the Spouſes deſire, <hi>I would
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:15279:105"/>
lead thee, I would bring
thee into my mothers houſe:</hi>
And thus ſhe doth indeed;
<hi>I held him and would not
let him goe until I brought
him into my mothers houſe;</hi>
which is no other but to
bring him into the heart,
where hee dwelleth by
Faith. As the Conduit-pipe
bringeth home wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
from the Fountaine to
the Ciſterne, ſo the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit
of Faith bringeth
home the Fountaine of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
water, even Chriſt
himſelfe, to the Ciſterne
of the heart. As the eye
of Faith in Prayer look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for Chriſt, ſo the hand
of faith bringeth him
home, for faith is a thrifty
grace, bringing all riches
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:15279:105"/>
home to the ſoule. The
want of this thrifty courſe
maketh want of ſenſe in
our ſuits to God; for as
the light of Gods truth
bringeth home to the ſoul
the Mountaine of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,
ſo the Spirit of
Prayer bringeth home
the Lord to the ſoule of
an humbled ſinner. If a
man could fill the Cenſer
with odors, and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
with Groane<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and
labour not in particular
for this Vnion or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
between God &amp; his
Soule, God may be there
with litle or no immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
ſenſe of his preſence:
Look then to the plying
of this; for this will make
thee to remove every
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:15279:106"/>
thing that may diſpleaſe
the faithfull witneſſe, or
weaken ſenſe.</p>
               <p>A fift Mean to procure
ſenſe, is a due notice-ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of God &amp; our ſelves
in Prayer: The knowledge
of our ſelves, Moral, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,
and Spirituall, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth
us quite out of our
ſelves, and <hi>leadeth us</hi> (as
one ſaith) <hi>as it were by the
hand to the knowledge of
God;</hi> by which reflection
or circular knowledge we
come to be vile in our
owne eyes: It caſteth out
and keepeth out ſin, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the Spirit rejoyce to
beare witneſſe with our
Spirits, that our Prayers
are as odors of incenſe in
his noſtrills. Againe, the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:15279:106"/>
Spirituall knowledge of
Gods Excellency, Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty,
Al-ſufficiency of
all his Attributes and
workes, worketh a lively
ſenſe in the Suiter, becauſe
the bare naturall or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
knowledge of
God, be it as may be, will
never beget any ſenſe
without that anointing
eye-ſalve. This knowledg
then of Gods Excellency
will countervail the ſenſe
of thine owne unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
his Soveraignty will
command the rebellion
thereof: His All-ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
ſupplyeth thy wants;
all his attributes, yea, even
his Iuſtice (in Chriſt) ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
for thy good; This
knowledge giveth thee
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:15279:107"/>
not only (with the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then)
ſome light to ſee
God in his Creatures.
The truth of this paſſage
appeareth plainly in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
his ſuite to God
for <hi>Sodome; I have taken
upon me,</hi> or begun <hi>to ſpeak
unto the Lord, and I am
duſt and aſhes,</hi> whereby a
reflective knowledge of
God upon him ſelfe, hee
ſeeth and acknowledgeth
himſelfe to be nothing:
yet by this is not diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
but rather encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to continue his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
renuing it to the
number of nine times,
which hee could never
have done without the
ſenſe of the Spirits appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:15279:107"/>
Our comming ſhort
herein maketh us come
ſhort of ſenſe in Prayer,
for either we examine not
our ſelves, and empty not
our ſelves of our ſelves as
we ſhould, till we be vile
in our own eyes, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord will not let
us know that hee taketh
notice of us, till we take
better notice of our ſelves;
or on the contrary, wee
fixe both our eyes upon
our owne unworthineſſe,
vileneſſe, and inſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
where finding no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of feeling, wee drench
our ſelves in teares of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair
with <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> becauſe
there is nothing found in
us worthy to give teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony:<note place="margin">Rev. 5. 4.</note>
But we looke not
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:15279:108"/>
up to the <hi>Lyons</hi> power,
nor the worth of the
<hi>Lambes</hi> blood, by which
the ſealed evidence of the
Fathers good will is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
or broken up to us,
by whom the Odors or
Prayers of the Saints are
carried up to the Father,
and to the Fathers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
and evidence of his
preſence is brought down
into the ſoule. And this is
the means to make us ſing
that new ſong with trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
joy and melody in
ovr heart, having God in
Chriſt to be all in all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, though wee be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of our ſelves.</p>
               <p>The ſixt and laſt ſenſe-procuring
Meane, is a
cloſe and conſtant holy
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:15279:108"/>
walking with God in all
our Thoughts, Words, &amp;
Actions, both in our ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
and particular cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
The guidance of the
Spirit, Praying by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and Evidence of the
Spirit (in ſome meaſure)
goe uſually together; (I
ſay uſually) becauſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
the two firſt may be
without the laſt, and that
for cauſes beſt knowne to
God, as ſome ſinne paſt,
prevention of ſome ſinne,
as ſpirituall pride, or the
like; or for the tryall of
the patience of the Saints,
and their continuance in
Prayer, <hi>trusting in the
Lord, although hee ſhould
kill them:</hi> And truly I may
ſay for the comfort of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:15279:109"/>
ſuch, that though it be not
ſo ſweet a condition as
that which is joyned with
ſenſe, yet it is as happy &amp;
as ſure a condition as that
which is carried by ſenſe,
if all meanes for ſenſe be
uſed. Hither may I apply
that ſaying of our Saviour
to <hi>Thomas,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh 20. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou beleeveſt
becauſe thou ſeest, bleſſed
are thoſe that have not
ſeen and yet have beleeved:</hi>
So, bleſſed are thoſe that
continue in Praier, though
they want the ſenſe of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
in Prayer.</p>
               <p>But to the matter in
hand, cloſe obedience out
of Prayer, bringeth good
Evidence in Prayer, not
only as the effect, or as
the fruit evidenceth the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:15279:109"/>
tree, but it challengeth the
Spirit of promiſe to be
with us in Prayer, to give
Evidence and Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to his owne Worke:
For as remiſſe walking in
a Chriſtian (though not
abſolutely looſe) doth in
ſome ſort quench the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and damp the evidence
thereof in Prayer; ſo a
cloſe, ſtrict, and holy wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
with God, doth quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and rejoyce the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
for that it is ready with
cheerfulneſſe to give joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
evidence, when wee
goe about its particular
buſineſſe of Prayer. This
<hi>walking with God</hi> (for
which the Patriarchs and
Saints were commended)
<hi>is</hi> nothing elſe (as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:15279:110"/>
to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth
it) but <hi>a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of God by faith and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience:</hi>
Now when we
thus pleaſe him, hee (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his covenant
made to <hi>Ahraham</hi> and his
ſeed,) is with us in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts,
by giving us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
of aſſurance. But
our want of this, maketh
weakneſſe of Prayer, and
want of aſſurance: Many
mens affections are led
captive and their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
wee preſume our
wayes to be Gods wayes,
when they are none of
his; by being ſtrict in one
of the Tables, we take li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to tranſgreſſe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
The harmony of the
Spirit is diſtempered by
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:15279:110"/>
our diſordered paſſions;
we beare falſe witneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God in denying
the Saints their due, out
of a partiall humour, and
therefore it is juſt with
God to withdraw his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
from our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts,
though we eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſire it. Laſtly, the
hearts of the moſt profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
are ſo overcharged
with the cares of this life,
that the Spirit alſo is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercharged
with the dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
&amp; deadneſſe of their
Prayers, whereby the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
hath ſmall force with it
and the evidence is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed:
Therefore looke
to thy walking in every
particular, if ever thou
meaneſt to attaine to aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:15279:111"/>
in thy Prayer.</p>
               <p>Other meanes I might
deliver for the obtaining
of ſenſe, as due Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to Praier, a Habit of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ejaculations, but I have
already ſpoke of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and will only adde
this, Withdraw thy ſelfe
from all impediments, &amp;
prepare thy ſelfe with a
reverent awe to meet thy
God: And for the later,
Theſe holy breathings, as
ayre, keepe and cleere the
fire upon the hearth,
whereby ſenſe is kindled
when thou ſetteſt upon
the worke: Alſo for helpe
in this particular, the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
uſe of ſecret Prayer
will doe well; <hi>David</hi> (as I

underſtand, firſt, that Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is no acquired gift by

an infuſed ability of the
Spirit (as I have ſhewed,)
which God, out of the
free motive of his love,
powreth upon all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one of his choſen,
when hee worketh that
glorious change in them
by the power of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.
<hi>The wind bloweth
where it listeth, and thou
heareſt the ſound thereof,
but canſt not tell whence it
commeth nor whither it go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:</hi>
So is every one that
is borne of the Spirit. As
this is ſpoken of the free

by the beſt man in
his naturall eſtate, or
moſt compleate endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
before his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>Further, ſince thou
doeſt enquire alſo in thy
caſe with thoſe that came
to <hi>Iob,</hi> what thou ſhouldſt
doe, I anſwer, thou muſt
know &amp; ingeniouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,
that thou canſt not

that they can pray,
when they can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
leſſe: And this reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:15279:117"/>
not only to carnall
profeſſours, who hold it
a hereſie to doubt that
they cannot pray to God,
but alſo to cloſe and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
hypocrites, yea tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
profeſſours in the
higheſt degree, whoſe
hearts fouly deceive the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in this particular. The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of the proud Phariſee
amongſt the reſt of his
faults, that he could pray
and none like him, ſpoiled
him for ever from pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
To men ſo conceited
that ſaying of the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
well agreeth: <hi>When
the minds of men are once
take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> up with falſ opinions,
they make them not only

combine themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
Even juſt ſo it is
with men in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
yea I dare avouch that
this conceit maketh ſuch
further off from prayer
then prophane Infidells
that never offered to pray
in all theit lives. It is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of a skilfull Muſitian,
that hee tooke twice as
much for teaching thoſe
that were evill taught, as
for thoſe that were not
taught at all; becauſe a
falſe poſition in a ſcience
is a greater hinderance to
the attainment thereof,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:15279:118"/>
then the pure privation of
it: if ever then thou deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt

that thou canſt
not pray at all; know that
thou art ſtark blinde and
lame, that thou maiſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
thy limbs and ſight.</p>
               <p>In the next place, thou
muſt lay to heart and bee
ſenſible of thy miſerable
and wretched condition,
through want of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
gift of prayer: this
well conſidered will make
thee at thy wits end, and
it will ſhake the ſandy
foundation of all thy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,
it will batter &amp;
take the fort of all thy
vain confidence, it wil cut
the ſinews of all thy ſelfe
deceiving policy, it will
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:15279:119"/>
faint the heart, and dead
the very ſoule of all thy
pale-faced hopes, it will
imbitter the ſweetneſſe of
al thy ratſ-bane pleaſures,
it will mar the market of
all thy poſſeſſions &amp; trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
it will bring off the
hooks all thy jollity and
mirth, it will make thee
behold, as in a true glaſſe,
all thy jollity and madde
mirth, it will let thee ſee
the vanity of all thy great
friends, favorites, ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
lovers, acquaintance,
yea the Ioviall compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
In a word, if thou
wilt hold to it, it will give
thee no reſt till thou haſt
found ſome other footing
for thy ſoul to reſt on.</p>
               <p>To make all good, let
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:15279:119"/>
me a litle expoſtulate the
matter with thee: What
canſt thou doe in the day
of thy diſtreſſe, <hi>when
trouble comes upon thee,
like paine on a woman in
child-birth?</hi> When thy
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience begins to roare,
thy ſoul to faint, thy ſtate
to waſt or bee taken from
thee by violence? Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
canſt thou goe? Wilt
thou know what thou
canſt doe? I know, &amp; thou
ſhalt know it, thou canſt
doe juſt nothing for thy
ſelfe that good is. If thou
canſt not pray, thou canſt
goe no where at all out of
thy ſelfe; to him thou
canſt not goe that hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
life, for thou art
not acquainted with him,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:15279:120"/>
thou haſt no odours to
fill the Cenſer, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee hath nothing for
thee but a Cenſer full of
fire from the Altar to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
thee: here thou maiſt
know (if thou wilt) that
thou art blind, and naked,
miſerable and wretched.
But what is the remedy?
where is the refuge? who
is thy ſhelter in this thy
diſtreſſe? Surely if thou
canſt not pray, thou maiſt
look about thee, within
thee, aboue thee, beneath
thee, and finde no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
refuge, or helpe: For
thou haſt no promiſe of
all theſe in calling upon
God, no promiſe of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,
as I have ſhewed:
yea inſtead thereof, thou
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:15279:120"/>
haſt <hi>the arrow of the Lords
wrath drawn</hi> (even to the

plague<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or fearefull ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
come amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?
If thou canſt pray juſt ſo
much as thou canſt doe
for thy ſelfe, yea if they
were all running to hell,
which is worſe then the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:15279:121"/>

nor wilt ſtay them, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
haſten them thither.
Obſerve this I beſeech
thee, as thou art husband
or wife, parent or childe,
maſter or ſervant; what
canſt thou doe for thy

<hi>hate the evill</hi> (ſaith the

                  <note place="margin">Amos. 5. 14.</note> The meerely mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
man doth counſel thee
to converſe with ſuch as
will make thee better, as
men by conſtant conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
with natives of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
doe learne the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the nation; ſo by
ſorting thy ſelf with beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
thou maiſt happily
learne to beg.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:15279:125"/>
Fiftly, thou muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
the godly earneſtly
to pray for thee, and to
beg thee of the Lord, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
much of their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
which be of that effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
<hi>to convert a ſinner
from his waies, and to ſave
a ſoule from death, hiding
a multitude of ſinnes.</hi> If
thus thou doſt, and God
affecteth the hearts of his
people to pray for thee,
there is good hope that
thou ſhalt come to pray
for thy ſelfe and for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
alſo; for the Sonne
of many prayers ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
periſh: but ſo long as
thou doſt ſcoffe &amp; mock
at the prayers of the
Saints, or haſt them in
light eſteem, the ſpirit of
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:15279:125"/>
prayer or ſupplication
will not come nigh thee.
Yet with this begging of
the prayers of the Saints,
thou maiſt learne to beg
thy ſelfe. The people of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> deſired <hi>Samuel</hi> to
pray for them when they
had ſinned; but they prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
alſo for themſelves;
but <hi>Pharaoh</hi> deſired <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
to pray againe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
for him, but hee
would never learne to
pray for himſelfe, neither
did he at all deſire <hi>Moſes</hi>
his prayer,<note place="margin">Exod. 8. 8.</note> till the hand of
God was the ſecond time
upon him, for at the firſt
he did not. A great many
doe never deſire the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of Gods people; if
they deſire them at all, it
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:15279:126"/>
is not till Gods hand be ſo
heavy upon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they
know not what to doe.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, thou muſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the meanes of the
word, read, preached and
conferred upon, for thou
ſhalt never learne to ſpeak
to God, except thou hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
God ſpeak unto thee:
hee that turnes away his
eare from hearing the
Law, even his prayer ſhall
be abomination; It is not
a ſet manner in a ſecret
corner, nor the beſt pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
praier that thou canſt
get by hart, without a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
attendance on the
word, eſpecially preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that ever will teach or
inable thee to pray: <hi>For
faith commeth by hearing;
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:15279:126"/>
And becauſe wee believe
therefore we ſpeak:</hi> As the
lame man in the Goſpell
lay ſtill by the Poole of
<hi>Betheſda</hi> (which was the
meanes appointed for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery)
till the power of
God had wrought upon
him, ſo thou muſt ſtill at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the meanes, till God
ſmite the heart, unvail the
eyes, touch and untie the
tongue to this duty of
prayer.</p>
               <p>Seventhly and laſtly,
enquire &amp; learn of God's
people, and they can tell
thee what unvaluable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
what ſweet pleaſures,
what unſpeakable conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
what peace-paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
underſtanding, what
height of honour, what
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:15279:127"/>
heaven of happineſſe, they
find in this familiar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
with God; <hi>aske
and they will tell thee</hi> (as a
Father obſerveth) <hi>that of
all vertues they can find
none but this compared to
incenſe.</hi> Secondly, they
can tell thee on experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that it is the beſt
guard againſt all aſſaults
of Sinne and Sathan. All
kind of Divels are kept
out and caſt out by this.
When the <hi>evill Spirit
came upon Saul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Sam. 16. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>David</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed
and abandoned it
by playing on his <hi>harpe;</hi>
that <hi>harpe,</hi> ſaith one, was
devout Prayer: Thirdly,
if thou wouldſt know
what is the beſt trading,
Gods people will tel thee
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:15279:127"/>
there is none like Prayer:
For no ſtate, time, place,
perſon, or oppoſition, can
intercept thrift if thou
art diſpoſed to pray; thou
maiſt ever be imploying
thy ſtock, and that with
the returne of encreaſe;
thou maiſt gain more by
Prayer, in one houre (as
one ſaith well) then all the
Merchants in the world
in a thouſand yeares.
Fourthly, wilt thou know
what is the very beſt phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick?
Gods people can tell
thee by experience, that
none is like Prayer: It hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
the infirmities of the
body, and the diſeaſes of
the ſoule, and the <hi>Praiers
of the faithfull ſhall ſave
the Sicklie, and the Lord
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:15279:128"/>
ſhall raiſe them up,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iam. 5. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>and if
he have committed ſinnes
they ſhall be forgiven him:</hi>
Fiftly, if it be enquired
what is the greateſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
that mortall man
can obtaine unto? Is it not
this, for a man to talke fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly
with God as with
his friend? <hi>And ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
have all the Saints,</hi>
and they only: What ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
were it for a poore,
meane, deſpicable man
to come to be ſo inward
with a great Monarch to
have his eare at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and to goe into the
bed-chamber when hee
liſt without repulſe or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption
of any? So is it
with Gods favorites, how
deſpicable, and deſpiſed
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:15279:128"/>
ſoever they be amongſt
men: <hi>Hee that will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
with God</hi> (ſaith one)
<hi>let him pray frequently;</hi> let
him read diligently; for
when we ſpeak with God,
when wee read or heare,
God ſpeaketh to us. Sixt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if thou wouldſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
of the beſt armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thine enemies, of
the beſt, ſafeſt refuge in
diſtreſſe, the ſpeedieſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
out of trouble,
the Saints can aſſure thee
upon experience, that
there is none like this: wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<hi>Moſes, Hester, Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaphat</hi>
and the reſt. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venthly,
wouldſt thou
command all the armes
of creatures, as heaven &amp;
earth and all the creatures
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:15279:129"/>
therein, yea, even the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
themſelves, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God wil teach thee,
that Prayer is the only
word of command. By
this <hi>Elijah</hi> did open and
ſhut the heavens; By this
<hi>Moſes</hi> tied and untied the
hands of the Almighty;
by this <hi>Iacob</hi> made the
Lord to ſtay with him, ſo
that hee could not depart
till hee had bleſſed him.
Eighthly and laſtly in a
word, wouldſt thou have
a guide that might direct
thee, and protect thee, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
thee, and never leave
thee till thou art brought
through this trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
vale to the life of
glory, the Saints can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
thee, that Prayer is
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:15279:129"/>
the only meane to bring
the guidance of the Spirit
into the heart, and there
to continue it, till thou
commeſt to thy journies
end; theſe effects of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
who can chooſe but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect?</p>
               <p>Now if thou doeſt fall
in love with the Fruits,
thou maiſt haply endeavor
to get the Tree into the
garden of thy ſoul, which
will make all the ground
fruitful. Theſe rules being
obſerved by thee, and the
motives conſidered, thou
art in a fair poſſibility, to
come acquainted with
God, by whoſe mercy &amp;
guidance I have been led
along in this litle Treatiſe:
deſiring for the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:15279:130"/>
nothing but this, that
God may have the
honour, &amp; his
People the
profit.</p>
