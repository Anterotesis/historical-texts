            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>SElf-love, which like Fire covets to
resolve all things into it self, makes
men they care not what Villany
or what Impiety they act, so it may but
conduce to their own advantage. And
from hence it was, that the Heathens
turned Religion into a Trade, wherein
the most gainful was their Sacrifices:
<hi>mendicantes vicatim Deos ducunt;</hi> a
God was then as fit an object for Charity,
as now a broken Arm, or a wooden Leg:
nor did they consider their Gods any
otherwise, than for their own Interest.
Now as Musick hath that Sympathetick
power, to heighten that Passion which is
most predominant in mens Natures, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Mirth or Melancholy; so likewise
Religion if it meets with good Nature, it
makes it better, but if with bad Nature,
it makes it worse: not that true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is here to be blamed, but only those ill
constitutions, wherein the most Sacred
<pb facs="tcp:59675:3"/>
Instructions turn sower. Obdurate hearts
are ever most subject to Atheism, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
softer Natures are ever more inclined
to Superstition; in which latter, Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is ever more prevalent than Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
for as Philosophy applies it self to
Reason, so doth Religion to `Passion; and
therefore none are so successful, as those
Fanatical sellers of words, who are most
quarrelsom with their Pulpits: whereby
they have a double advantage; first, they
appear more zealous to the World; and
secondly, the Nonsense they deliver is
not so easily discerned by the credulous
multitude, who are ever ravished with
the Tone and Noise, and praise not the
Lord but through the Nose.</p>
            <p>The Immortal God is of too sublime a
Nature, to be comprehended by us Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals;
wherefore no men are so great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists,
as those who make a livelihood
by telling Lyes of his most Sacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty:
<hi>converso in precium Deo.</hi> How
many Religions are there in the World,
which (though of contrary Principles to
one another) yet all pretend themselves
derived from one and the same Infinite
<pb facs="tcp:59675:3"/>
Being! Therefore he who would be of the
most excellent Faith, must try all, and
then (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> advises) hold fast that
which is best. He should do by the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Religions, as <hi>Potamon</hi> of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi>
did by the many Sects of Philosophy,
elect what was good out of each, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquish
the bad. Now most Religions
(excepting ours) being tainted with the
Interest of the Clergy, he must examine
and consider them accordingly: For if a
Porter should come and tell me, he had
brought me such a Letter from my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the first part of the Letter
should teach Obedience to Parents, but
the latter part of it should command me
to give the said Porter half my Estate;
in this case I should (notwithstanding
the testimony of his brother Porters)
without some further demonstration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Letter a counterfeit; as also
that the first part of it, which taught Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
was only to make way for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
and principal clause, <hi>viz.</hi> the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Porter money.</p>
            <p>Now most of the Heathen Priests were
such Proters, and their <hi>Arcana Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:59675:4"/>
but ridiculous Nothings, wherewith
they deluded the Vulgar. As I have
heard of a Country-Alehouse-keeper, who
being a crafty Knave, devised this trick
to get a ready vent for his Liquor: He
gave out a report at several Market-Towns
that he had taken a monstrous
Beast in such a Wood; whereupon many
Country-people flock'd into see this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Beast, which out of policy he kept
in the dark corner of a Room, withall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising
the people not to approach too near
him, for fear of danger: but this not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying
the curiosity of one of the Clowns,
who had drank higher than the rest, he
runs into this Monster, unties him, and
brings him out into the light; where this
Creature (which had occasion'd so many
lyes, quarrels and disputes about the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of him, whilst he remain'd in the
dark) proved after all, to be nothing
but a little Cur-dog in a Doublet: <hi>Partu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siunt
montes, nascetur ridiculus mus.</hi>
However, the man had his design in sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
off his Liquor.</p>
            <p>Such were the mysteries of the ancient
Heathenish Religions, and what I have
<pb facs="tcp:59675:4"/>
here written concerns them only: for
when Christ came into the World, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
a Doctrine so pious, just, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
that (even in its Infancy) its
own merits supported it, without the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of Princes or Grandees. What
is more reasonable than to forbear those
Lusts which will ruine us both here and
hereafter? or who but a mad-man would
condemn that Law for unjust, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits
him from murdering himself? and
Christ doth no more. Now if the Law be
good, what must the Law-giver be? for
such as the Fruit is, such must the Tree be
also. Some have even among the He a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
been reported to have wrought Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
as <hi>Apollonius Tyanaeus;</hi> others
have deliver'd good Doctrines, as <hi>Plato,
Seneca, Epictetus,</hi> &amp;c. but what one
man ever did both to that persection, as
Christ did? Many in all Religions have
dyed to justifie their Opinions; but who
like the Primitive Christians, ever dyed
to justifie the truth of Miracles, which
they beheld with their own eyes? But
this is unnecessary, for that I write not to
Heathens, but Christians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59675:5"/>The general decay of Piety, hath in
most Religions what soever proceeded from
the exemplary viciousness of their Clergy;
(though perhaps less in ours, than in
others; for I am unwilling to raise an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
outery against a good Air, because
some few debauch'd persons dye in it.)
Should a Physician prohibit all Mankind
from Wine, as poysonous, and presently
he himself should drink some, I had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to question the truth of his former opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and should have cause to believe,
that he coveted to monopolize the best
Wines for himself. What Heathen
Priests could with any confidence prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
Murther, when they themselves did sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>frequently
sacrifice poor innocent men in
their Temples? with what justice could
that Priest who assisted at the Rape of
<hi>Paulina</hi> in the Temple of <hi>Apis,</hi> proscribe
Adulteries or Rapes?</p>
            <l>If Shepherds go themselves astray,</l>
            <l>How should their Sheep ere find the way?</l>
            <l>If he that Teaches, is to Learn,</l>
            <l>How should the Scholar truth discern?</l>

               <p>A Discourse concerning Heathen Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
in general, were certainly a
vast undertaking, and vain; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too immense a labour for any one man,
either by reading, sufficiently to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the Ancient Idolatry, or by Travel
through both the <hi>Indies</hi> to discern that of
this Age. Nor would it be less vain, if
possible to be attain'd: For all Superstitions
are to the people but like several Sports to
Children, which varying in their several
Seasons, yield them pretty entertainment
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59675:6"/>
for the time, and when grown out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
deserve no further consideration, but
are still supplanted by new ones to the same
purpose. Therefore to abbreviate my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
after having touched a little up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Original of Idolatry, I do in the rest
of this discourse confine my self to one part
of their Superstition, <hi>viz.</hi> their Sacrifices,
and more especially their Sanguinary ones,
as being the most horrid and bruitish of all
others: Also in them I observe only their
seeming Rational and Politick Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
without mentioning the Sacerdotal
particulars in the celebration of their fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Ceremonies; which are innumerable,
though in effect but like the Ribbons on a
Hobby-horse. Now if any Hypocrite to
glorifie his own zeal, should pretend that a
discourse of this nature does through the
Heathen Sacrifices, reproach those of <hi>Moses,</hi>
which resembled them but in outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
he must receive himself from that
error, if he rightly apprehends the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:
For the one justifies his Institutions
as directed to the true God, and ordain'd as
Typical by his appointment; whereas the
other (<hi>viz.</hi> those of the Heathen) had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of these Qualifications, and therefore
no more ought to be spared for their resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
to those of the <hi>Jews,</hi> than a Criminal
ought to be pardoned for wearing the same
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59675:6"/>
coloured Garments with the Judge. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
for the further justification of this
Treatise, I have the Holy Scriptures for my
President, wherein we may often find re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
the Idolatry of the Ancient Heathens,
<hi>viz.</hi> of such as sacrificed to <hi>Baal,</hi> and offer'd
up Cakes to the Queen of Heaven: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all further Apologies I shall decline, as
unnecessary in so brief a Narrative.</p>

               <p>Before Religion, that is to say, Sacrifices,
Rites, Ceremonies, pretended Revelations,
and the like, were invented amongst the
Heathens, there was no worship of God but
in a rational way, whereof the Philosophers
pretending to be Masters, did to this end,
not only teach Virtue and Piety, but were
also themselves great examples of it in their
Lives and Conversations; whom the People
chiefly follow'd, till they were seduced by
their crafty and covetous Sacerdotal Order;
who, instead of the said Virtue and Piety,
introduced Fables and Fictions of their own
coining; perswading the Vulgar, that as
men could not by any natural abilities of
their own, know the best manner of serving
God, so it was necessary that He should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
the same to his Priests in some extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
manner, for the better instruction of
the People. Whereupon pretermitting the
Doctrines of Piety and Goodness for the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59675:7"/>
most part, they introduced a Religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of their own moulding, which amused
and suspended mens minds in great part,
and at last made the people relie so much
upon them, that they neglected their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
duties, consisting chiefly in the Sacrifices,
Expiations, and Lustrations of their Priests;
who finding they got more by the sins and
ignorance of the common people, than by
their virtue and knowledge, made divers
things sins which otherwise were but indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
especially those things which mens na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
could with the most difficulty resist:
which observation produced this ingenious
Copy of Verses from a Modern Author, no

               <p>They forbad some meats as unclean,
which yet were wholsom; commanding
others to be used, which yet must be offer'd
or sacrificed, that so they might have their
parts; allotting some days to labour, and
others to idleness: of all which, and many
more conspicuous in pomp and ceremony,
they constituted themselves the Patrons and
Procurers. To whom no men were so odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
as your incredulous honest men; for if
a man were incredulous and vicious, that
was the greater honour to the credulous
party; or if a man were credulous and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
that did not any more reflect upon
their Religion, than one man's being hang'd
for dishonesty, scandalizes a Government;
besides they might pretend his Faith was
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59675:8"/>
never sincere. But he that led an honest
virtuous life, without any Faith for their
Supersticions, he was the only person odious
unto them, as a person that demonstrated
unto the World how unnecessary the Priests
and their Doctrines were to the propagation
of Virtue. The Philosophers had their extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies
in Natural, but they all agreed
in Moral Philosophy; nor was Virtue any
where better delineated, than by those an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Philosophers, <hi>Plato, Aristotle, Seneca,
Plutarch, Epictetus, &amp;c.</hi> in so much that
<hi>Hyerophantae,</hi> or Teachers of Holy Doctrine,
was a name anciently and primitively given
to Philosophers. <hi>Sit pura mente colendus:</hi>
A pure undefiled Spirit is the only Sacrifice
which Philosophy commands them to offer
unto God. But as that taught the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God in his works, and a rational
way to serve him, so the Doctrines of their
Priests introduced not only impertinent, but
also absurd and impious Tenents concerning
God and Religion, withdrawing them as
well from the use of their Reason, as from
the study of Truth: not allowing them any
knowledge of God, or Religious worship,
but what themselves taught. Nay they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd
the people into the Adoration of many
Gods, because thereby they acquired to
themselves much greater advantages by
adoring many Deities, and introducing se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59675:8"/>
worships of them, than they could
have expected from the single worship of
one supreme God. All which serves but to
confirm the verity of that Epigram, <hi>Vt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
possis fallere, sume togam;</hi> This Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotal
villany was well known to <hi>Diogenes,</hi>
as we may learn from the Answer he made
to the Priest who came to convert him to be
of his Order, in hopes of <hi>Elizium: Wilt thou</hi>
(saith <hi>Diogenes) have me to believe that these
famous men</hi> Agesilaus <hi>and</hi> Epimanondas <hi>shall
be miserable, and that thou who art but an Ass,
and doest nothing of any worth, shalt be happy
only because thou art a Priest?</hi> So contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
was their profession in that wise man's
opinion. But of this more hereafter.</p>

               <p>The Primitive Institution of Idolatry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
its Birth from Princes, at whose
charge it was afterwards Educated by Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticks;
the one made the Idol, and the
other ordain'd the worship of it. And this
we may learn from the Book of the <hi>Wisdom
of Solomon,</hi> wherein it is said, <hi>That the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
made the Image of the deceased Son, and
the Son of the dead Father.</hi> Thus <hi>Ninus</hi> after
the death of his Father <hi>Nimrod,</hi> worshipp'd
him by the name of <hi>Bel,</hi> or <hi>Belus,</hi> which in
the <hi>Punick</hi> Tongue signifies <hi>God:</hi> (From
whence I conceive that errour of many Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians
does proceed, who hearing of a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59675:9"/>
                  <hi>Nimrod</hi> that after his death was adored by
the name of <hi>Belus,</hi> presently misapprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them to be two several persons, who
were really but one under two several
names: And therefore we see <hi>Africanus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
his Chronicle with <hi>Belus.</hi>) Now the
use of this Adoration was to breed a venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the common people, not only for
the Prince deceased, but likewise for all his
Posterity, as men of the <hi>Jupitrean</hi> Race.
This Idol being therefore at first worshipp'd
only in commemoration of some <hi>Hero,</hi> or
gallant person, as his Effigies, grew in time
to be by Posterity revered as a God; and as
his courage or prudence in his life-time, was
conducive to the grandeur and glory of his
Subjects, so they thought being dead, he
was no less able to assist them: with which
expectation they paid frequent Vows, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Sacrifices unto him, such as were
ordain'd by their Priests.</p>

               <p>Now Idolatry being thus instituted by
the Civil power, the Ecclesiastick was left
to build upon that foundation, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
them with a fit opportunity to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
those Rites and Ceremonies, as might
render them necessary in the performance of
the same. For as men who drink Healths,
do it more for love of the Liquor, than for

themselves: They not being like the

to Christ's Rule) ought to be like
Sheep amongst Wolves; whereas the others
were rather like Wolves among Sheep.

their impious Doctrines, when poor <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
could not escape with his life, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he preach'd up the belief of one su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme

               <p>Now whenever these Priests wanted wit
to delude the Vulgar, with ambiguous An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
of their own inventions, they repair'd
to the Temples of their Gods, and there lay
all that Night; telling the people at their

               <p>The first Idolatry is thought to have come
from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and that the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> in all

from the Sun, or at least from the whole
Machine of Heaven. The next to the <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi>
were the <hi>Hetrusci,</hi> who proved their
Doctrine by Antiquity and Universality, as
also by Predictious. But the most ancient
Religion next to the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> and <hi>Hetrus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi>
was that of the <hi>Druyds,</hi> who were
heretofore the Priests of <hi>France, Germany,</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:59675:10"/>
and some parts of <hi>England.</hi> The School of
these <hi>Druyds</hi> flourish'd within less than one
hundred years after the <hi>Phoenicians;</hi> and
were destroyed, together with their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
worship, by the Emperor <hi>Tiberius.</hi>
These <hi>Druyds</hi> (besides some Opinions they
held in common with the other <hi>Gentiles,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
worship due to the Heavens, Planets,
and Stars) took certain observations from
Oaks, Galls, and Misletow, for their prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nostication
of the ensuing year. The <hi>Bardi</hi>
were a distinct Colledge in <hi>England</hi> from the
<hi>Druyds;</hi> they had little of the Philosopher
or Vaticinator in them. The <hi>Brachmans</hi>
were ancient Philosophers and Priests in the
<hi>Indies,</hi> and continue so to this day; they
hold the Transmigration of Souls with <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras,</hi>
which Opinion (as both <hi>Apian</hi>
and <hi>Clemens</hi> affirm) he took from the <hi>Jews,</hi>
and was therefore (say they) circumcised
after their manner. The <hi>Gymnosophists</hi> were
an ancient Sect of Philosophy and Divinity
amongst the <hi>Aethiopians.</hi> The <hi>Persians</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<hi>Zoroaster,</hi> acknowledged <hi>duplex

the Sun above, and the Fire beneath:
They had anciently their Wise men, or <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi.</hi>
The <hi>Thracians</hi> communicated many of
their Rites and Ceremonies to the <hi>Grecians.</hi>
The <hi>Scythians</hi> and <hi>Getes</hi> had certain Priests
and Philosophers instituted according to the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59675:11"/>
manner of <hi>Zamolxis;</hi> who travelling into
<hi>Aegypt,</hi> brought home with him some of
their Doctrines and Ceremonies. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Roman</hi> Priests took many of their Laws

their Philosophers and Priests call'd <hi>Athan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trei,

Sects there were not any two that
agreed exactly in their Doctrines, although
the fundamental design of all was the same,
<hi>viz.</hi> the sharing of the Sheep; about which

in so much that one of the Ancients
said, He would avoid all controverted points,
until the Priests were agreed amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>

               <p>There is nothing does more endanger Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
than Oblivion: therefore so long as
<hi>Jupiter</hi> was preach'd up at all, they did not
much concern themselves under what seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Names, or several kinds of Adoration
they worshipp'd him; such kind of disputes
being but like a quarrel between little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
who having got one Joynted-Baby
amongst them, fall together by the ears
about the naming and dressing of it. For
Heresies in Religion, are but like Ivy-Trees,
which though at first they rend and cleave
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59675:11"/>
the Walls whereunto they grow, yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
serve to uphold and support the same.
Also the Magistrates did frequently connive
at such Heresies, because they found the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Religion so prevalent in mens
minds, that their Clergy when well united
among themselves, did oftentimes contest
with the Secular power; which grew so
dangerous, that they were contented to
wink at the many divisions and absurdities
amongst them: <hi>ne Sacra plus possent, quam
Leges.</hi> The chief and most eminent Office
amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> was that of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurs:</hi>
the veneration and honour given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them was so great, that they were look'd
upon not only as the Gods Interpreters, but
also as Messengers and Agents betwixt them
and mankind. Besides, they were ever ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
to the Senate, and the rather, as is
conceiv'd, because from the first foundation
of <hi>Rome,</hi> until the change of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Kings were <hi>Augurs,</hi> as not thinking
it safe to disjoyn from the Regal power a
discipline so full of Authority, as was that
of an <hi>Augur:</hi> who were so highly esteem'd
among the Ancients, that no Magistrate
was chosen, nor business of importance done,
till they were first consulted:
<q>
                     <l>Those who to Empire by dark paths aspire,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>D.</hi>
                        </note>

Thus <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Numa</hi> could receive their

               <head>VII.</head>
               <p>The Heathen Priests thinking it dangerous
to teach any way to God which men might
go by themselves, without further guiding
and directing, (like Musicians who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to learn their Scholars to play by
Notes, lest they might grow able to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
themselves without a Master) did
not as our Christian Pastors do, furnish the
people with a record of their Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
whereby they might walk them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
without any other assistance; but on
the contrary they instituted Lustrations, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piations,
and the like, which none but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
could execute, and all was only to
render the Clergy absolutely necessary to the
people.</p>
               <p>The Original of Sacrifices seems to be as
ancient as Religion it self: for no sooner had
men found out that there was a God, but
Priests stept up and said, that this God had
taught them in what manner he would be
worshipp'd. As Religion therefore seems
to have began most anciently in the Eastern
parts, or as some will have it in <hi>Aegypt;</hi> so
did Sacrifices, which from thence were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated
to <hi>Greece, Italy,</hi> and other remoter
parts. The number of Sacrifices (says a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59675:12"/>
learned Author) were among the <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
reckon'd to be 666, which without all
question were multiplied by the Priests of
several Countries, where the said <hi>Aegyptian</hi>
Sacrifices were receiv'd. But what a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
was this, to think to flatter the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
with Inhumanity? to content the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
goodness with the affliction of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and to satisfie the Justice of God
with cruelty? A Superstitious man serveth
God out of fear, whereas the truly Religious
serves him out of love. Superstition suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
neither God nor man to live at rest, as
evidently appears by these Heathen Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
What could be more sottish or irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
than to think that the slaughter of a
poor innocent Creature, (who follow'd the
simplicity of his own Nature, without ever
offending God) should be so grateful to the
Deity, as thereby we might expiate our sins,
and render a sufficient attonement for the
most execrable villanies of mankind? as if
the Almighty Justice could be no otherwise
appeas'd for the errors of the Wicked, but
by the sufferings of the Innocent.</p>
               <p>Now as Sacrifices were the most ancient
and universal, so the greatest and most my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious
fourbs that ever were invented or
imposed upon mankind. What have Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
to do with sins? could none but their
unenlightned Priests make peace between
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59675:13"/>
God and man, when sins were committed?
was there no address to be made to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Majesty, but by their Intercession?
were they the Courtiers of Heaven, and
must they be first bribed before men could
receive a pardon for their sins? an inward
and hearty Repentance avail'd nothing
amongst them. Neither can the Heathens
be excused by saying, that at the same time
when Sacrifices were offer'd, they might
repent; for it doth so little appear that they
commanded Repentance, as we can hardly
find any mention thereof in their Religious
worship; however we may hope that God
did work it in some of their hearts: for we
find in <hi>Plato</hi> and other Philosophers, sorrow
for sin often enjoyn'd; and we may read
among the <hi>Septem Sapientes</hi> this Holy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
<hi>Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris,</hi>
which gives a brave entrance into the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Philosophy, as it stands recorded in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Writ. But this they ow'd to their Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,
and not Theology.</p>

               <p>The stupidity of these Heathen Sacrifices
are sufficiently already exploded by <hi>Lucian,
Arnobius,</hi> and others: The first condemning
them as ridiculous, the latter as impious;
for God will be serv'd in Spirit, and that
which is outwardly done, is rather to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
our selves, than God. Yet however, as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59675:13"/>
monstrous as their Doctrines and Sacrifices
appear, they have been the chief support
of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> Devotion for many thousand
years, and in some Nations continue to this
day. Perhaps melancholly men might at
first light upon this Frenzy, by observing
how Nature had inevitably framed all
Creatures to live by devouring and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one another; a man eats not one mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
but he destroys an Animal or Vegetable
life, or at least prevents them from attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that life, which otherwise they would
have enjoy'd. Nay, we cannot walk one
step, but probably we crush many Insects
creeping under our feet; and the same hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
to other Creatures: the Life of each
being by Nature made predatory upon
others.

an interpretation wiser than his vow, to
suppose the Hog a Fish, and so by devouring

it, to save himself from starving. It was
also found by experience, how many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
of violent accidents were ever ready
at hand to destroy all things that had life
in them, whereas preservatives were rarely
to be met with: nor could the very best
nourishment or Physick reprieve life any

towards death; wherefore but like
a small Parenthesis, intervening a long dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course:
Nor was the longest estate of life
above a moment, compared with that of
death, which is for ever irrecoverable.
Also the sickness of one man does often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

               <p>So that by these, and such like sinister

to Heaven, than their preservation: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon

the miserable condition of Humane life, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that fault upon the Deity, which did

many more <hi>Vejoves,</hi> or mischievous sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed

to divert their infection from the people:
as at this day many of the <hi>Indians</hi> do much
more worship and consult the Devil, for

it were possible for wise and virtuous men

might perhaps suppose it to proceed, not
out of cruelty, but rather as pleas'd to
have them by a quick passage withdrawn
from the sufferings and lingring decays of
long life, to be suddenly establish'd in an
everlasting undisturb'd peace and indolency;
or rather, if from our state of ignorance it
were possible to interpret Heaven, we
might imagine, that it has made all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
unavoidably to destroy one another;
in as much as that power which governs
the Universe, does perhaps contrive the
preservation and flourishing estate thereof
in a proportion as far exceeding its regard
of particulars, as the whole Globe of the
Earth exceeds the smallest Sand upon the
Sea-shore. And as for particular indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals,
<hi>Corruptio unius est Generatio alterius;</hi>
whereby it comes to pass, that not only
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59675:15"/>
their Life, but even their Death, helps
to renew the World, and so tends to its
continuation and prosperity. From hence
now peradventure men of Airy fancies
might conceit, some reason why in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
and all other Sublunarie things, when
any one lasts longer than is ordinary for
others of its kind to do, it is usually pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
with deformity and other decays, for
retarding (as much as in it lies) that
measure of the Worlds Renovation which
would by its more early change have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cru'd
thereunto.</p>
               <p>These thoughts unrectify'd, have even
among Christians caused some Hereticks
to think, that God has from the first crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
infus'd into all perishable things two
internal principles, the one of Life and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
the other of Death and destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
also that according as either of these
are more or less agreeably entertain'd, so
is the Creature more or less vigorous and
durable. Or peradventure they might
more appositely have observed the rise and
fall of things represented in the rotation of
Wheels in a Chariot, whose several Spoaks
are rais'd up, and cast down by one and
the same mover, at one and the same time,
without any separate assistant: for so they
thought that Infinite power, wisdom, and
goodness which is all in all, moves things
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59675:15"/>
by his immediate presence and inoperation,
without any need of <hi>Aristotle's</hi> Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<hi>Plato's</hi> Daemons, or other imaginary
powers subservient: Nor that it merits a
bad censure for destroying particulars, it
being for an universal good.</p>

               <p>Now because the generality of men are
not thus speculative or Philosophical in
their actions, but rather crafty and politick,
as designing to themselves power amongst
men, and by consequence Riches and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
the most nervous and effectual consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the Gentiles Sacrifices must be
taken that way. Thus when Princes who
in the governing of mankind, found it to
be an unruly Creature, mischievous, and
not capable to be guided by solid reason or
truth, but totally subjected to the passions
of hope and fear; how false and vain
soever it matter'd not, provided that things
were well fitted and suitable to their capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities:
wherefore they to encourage obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and good works, held forth gain and
preferment; as on the other side, to deterr
from disobedience and mischief, they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
forfeitures and disgrace:
<q>
                     <l>—Et ponere Leges,</l>
                     <l>Ne quis fur esset, neu latro, neu quis Adulter,</l>

                  </q>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:59675:16"/>
Yet in as much as <hi>abundans cautela non
nocet,</hi> and seeing there were many clande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine
Villanies so secret and undiscoverable,
as could hardly be brought to an open
conviction, for such the Magistrate rais'd
within them <hi>Animo tortore flagellum, viz.</hi>
in their Consciences the fear of some future
punishment; whereof for want of that
true knowledge which we enjoy, they
feign'd some of their own inventions, such
as the <hi>Stygian</hi> Lake, and the like; which
in as much as the goodness of God, and
their present invisibility rendred the less
credible, therefore the declaring them to
be with material Fire, as also Eternal, did
in good measure over-awe that incredulity.
From whence we may observe, how neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
and how natural is the belief of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

the unenlightned Heathens, as well for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency,

               <p>Now for the erecting of this Tribunal in
the minds of men, they (not being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned
from above) made use of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition,
(the off-spring of too much Honour,
and too much Fear) which being to be
managed cunningly, and well fitting to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59675:16"/>
vulgar capacities, they did little or not at
all regard the satisfaction of clear rational
men. For first, the number of them is so
small, as they are of no power; and then
they are too wise to hazard their own Ruine
for the instruction of foolish men, casting
Pearl before Swine; knowing withall, that
if any man should be so vain as to oppose
the common belief, the <hi>mobile</hi> would (as
they did by <hi>Socrates</hi>) oppress and decry
him for an Atheist. Therefore the wisest
among the Heathens follow'd this Rule in
their converse, <hi>Loquendum cum vulgo,
sentiendum cum sapientibus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; si mundus vult
decipi, decipiatur.</hi> Our Saviour himself
found how improper it was to unfold his
Sacred mysteries to the ignorant multitude,
and therefore explain'd not his Parable of
the Sower, till he was alone amongst the
Twelve,<note place="margin">Mark 4. 11, 12.</note> saying, <hi>Vnto you it is given to know
the mysterie of God: but unto them that are
without, all these things are done in parables;
that seeing they may see, and not perceive,
and hearing they may hear, and not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand:
lest at any time they may be converted,
and their sins should be forgiven them. He
that hath ears to hear let him hear,</hi> saith
Christ; that is, not every one that can hear,
but only such as are well able to digest and
understand what they do hear. Now this
kind of reservedness and secresie being like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59675:17"/>
observ'd by the most prudent of the
Heathens, it made their Priests altogether
neglect such thoughts, though never so
wise, as being well assured that their Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
would hinder them from discovering
or interesting themselves in the vulgar
Superstitions, how sottish soever. But
nevertheless, to fortifie themselves the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
against any such discovery, they ever
decry'd Humane wisdom, and magnify'd
Ignorance, well knowing that the seeds of
their foolish Doctrine, would prosper no
where but in barren ground. Reason teaches
that there is but one only supreme God;
but they taught the belief of many Gods.
Reason teaches that the Law of God, <hi>viz.</hi>
that Law which is absolutely necessary to
our future happiness, ought to be general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made known to all men; which theirs
was not. Reason makes no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
their <hi>Enthusiasticks,</hi> and our mad-men.
Reason expects some more convincing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to prove the infallible Divinity of
their Laws, Inspirations, and Miracles,
than an <hi>ipse dixit:</hi> and upon that Maxim
of <hi>Contra Principia non est disputandum,</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
would reply, <hi>Vno dato absurdo mille
sequunter.</hi> Reason would suspect the power
of their <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who had no way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the <hi>Trojans</hi> to himself, but was forc'd
to suffer his own Son <hi>Sarpedon</hi> to be knock'd
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59675:17"/>
on the head by them. Reason would tell us
that <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Rhemus</hi> were Bastards, and
that their Mother <hi>Rhea's</hi> pretence of being
layn with by God <hi>Mars,</hi> was only a sham
upon the credulous multitude, hoping
thereby to save both her credit and her life.
Again, when they desire me to give but the
same credit to the History of their Gods,
as I do to other History, I will; but as well
in their Religious, as in <hi>Livy</hi> or other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
History, when I hear of on Ox's spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
or a God's descending in a Cloud and
shower of Gold to lye with a woman, in all
such miraculous Narrations, my Reason
desires to be further satisfy'd in the truth of
them, than only by the report of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.
<hi>Proculus</hi> tells us of <hi>Romulus's</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after his death, and that he saw him all
array'd in white, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but my Reason bids
me <hi>quaere,</hi> whether he had not some hand
in his murther, and thought by pretending
<hi>Romulus</hi> to be taken up to Heaven, to clear
himself to the people of that suspicion.
<hi>Apollonius Tyanaeus</hi> is reported by <hi>Philostra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
to have rais'd a Maid from the dead,
but Reason questions whether the Maid was
not only asleep; for sleep is the Image of
death. <hi>Philostratus</hi> also further telleth, that
<hi>Apollonius</hi> vanish'd away out of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's
presence, before a great number of
people: but here Reason bids me observe,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59675:18"/>
that although it is reported to have been
done in the presence of a great number of
people, yet I have but the Testimony of
one man for the truth of it, <hi>viz. Philostratus,</hi>
and not the Testimony of all those people.
The darkness of the Sun at <hi>Julius Caesar's</hi>
death, appears to Reason to be but an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
proceeding from some natural cause,
and that it was no greater Complement to
<hi>Caesar,</hi> than to any other person in the World
that dyed at the same moment. There is
nothing how impossible soever to be done,
that is impossible to be believed; for two
men conspiring, one to seem Lame, and the
other to cure him with a charm, will deceive
many; but many conspiring, one to seem
Lame, the other to cure him, and all the
rest to bear witness, will deceive more.
Thus when <hi>Vespasian</hi> is said to cure the
Lame and the Blind, Reason reports the
story of it thus: That <hi>Vespasian</hi> observing
how Kingdoms are preserv'd and augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Religion, pretended himself to have
an immediate power from Heaven, and for
that end corrupted two of his subjects with
money, to feign themselves the one Blind,
and the other Lame; whom he afterwards
cured with much solemnity before the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
In the same manner the <hi>French</hi> Kings
cure men of the Evil; for the Physician first
examines the Patient's wound, and if he finds
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59675:18"/>
it incurable, then declares it is not the Evil;
but if he finds it a Sore that is easie and likely
to cure, then the Physician calls it the Evil,
that so the King may have the credit of
curing that, which would have done well
of it self. These and many more such Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postures
were put in practice by the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
which for as much as Humane Reason
detects, their Priests had great occasion to
exclaim against it, as they did. Let us
Christians from hence learn to esteem our
Religion the more, which stands the Test
of Reason, bidding us give a Reason for our
Hope.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, these grand Heathenish Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postures
(the <hi>Sacris initiati,</hi> as they call'd
themselves) the better to prepare for the
planting of their Idolatry in the minds of
men, did (under the pretence of speaking
after the manner of men) pre-suppose their
Gods to be originally of Flesh and Bloud,
attributing to them such passions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
as are only incident to mortals: They
made them of both Sexes, Gods and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desses;
<hi>Jupiter</hi> had his Wife <hi>Juno,</hi> and
either for variety, or when weary of her
Curtain-Lecture, he went to his Misses;
but for a fuller entertainment in his Cups,
they procured him a <hi>Ganymede:</hi> His Grave
was also to be seen in <hi>Crete,</hi> as well as the
Grave of any other person; and yet so sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tishly
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59675:19"/>
impious were they, as to believe this
dead man to be the ever-living God. Nay
they made their Deities subject to those
Vices which were acted but by the worst of
men: in so much that nothing is more cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
in <hi>Jupiter,</hi> than his Adultery; no
in <hi>Mercury,</hi> than his Fraud and Thefts, of
whose praises in a Hymn of <hi>Homer's,</hi> the
greatest is this: That being born in the
morning, he had invented Musick by noon,
and before night stoln away the Cattle of
<hi>Apollo</hi> from his Herdsmen. Therefore in
<hi>Minucius</hi> you may hear <hi>Octavius</hi> telling
<hi>Caelicius,</hi> that the Heathens entertain'd such
fabulous Notions of their Gods, as they
usually ascribed such horrid things to them,
as would be accounted scandalous and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable
to any good man:
<q>Immortalia mortali sermone notantes,
<bibl>Lucr.</bibl>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The Heathens (says <hi>Arnobius</hi>) did by
their Gods, as an Ass would do by <hi>Cato,</hi>
whom if he were to commend to his fellow
Asses, he would say he had delicate long
Ears, could Bray very loud, and carry
great Burthens; which being the most
eminent qualities in Asses, they would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
them to <hi>Cato</hi> when they meant to
praise him: and just so did they impiously
judge of their Gods; which an ingenious
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59675:19"/>
Physician observing, he would never give
one of their Priests Physick, till he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
what opinion his patient had of
Divine Vengeance; because if he magnify'd
Gods mercy, then he gave him something
to purge Flegm; whereas if he extoll'd
Gods Judgements, then he gave him some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to purge Choller. <hi>Cardan</hi> was so
uncharitable as to think this Superstition
(which did really sink under the ruines of
Paganism) was like the River <hi>Arethusa,</hi> risen
up again even among the Christians, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Nos nebulones loquimur de Deo, tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam
de uno è nobis.</hi> But this impiety is so
far from being practised amongst us Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
of the Reformed Church, that Atheism
it self would be as soon tolerated. <hi>Plutarch</hi>
desired rather to be forgotten in the World,
than remembred by the Name of the man
that used to devour his own Children, as
<hi>Saturn</hi> is reported to have done: and it is
better to have no opinion of God at all, than
such an one as is dishonourable to him, as
the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> well observes. Yet this
was the Heathen Faith; for although they
did not own themselves to be made after the
Image of God, yet did they in their fond
Imaginations make their Gods after the
Image of men: which must needs occasion
the same mutual likeness.</p>

               <p>Having thus therefore manured the
Ground of Popular understandings, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
to sow the Seed of vulgar Religions, they
sow'd thereupon such kind of Doctrines, as
they judged best capable of reception, and
most proper to each particular <hi>Genius</hi> of the
time and people, according as they found
them more or less rude or subtle, debauch'd
or austere. Hence grew their Oblations,
and Altars, whereon they were offer'd: these
did always accompany their Prayers; for
they supposing their Gods to be like the
Eastern Princes, before whom no man might
come empty handed, and perhaps because
a great part of their Offerings fell to the
Priests share; therefore they soon left off
<hi>Numn Pompilius's</hi> Institution, who accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the poverty of those times, ordain'd
a little Cake and Salt with a few Fruits: and
so <hi>Pythagoras</hi> appointed Honey, Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense,
Fruits, Flowers, and other things,
but always <hi>incruenta;</hi> till in process of time
their Gods (or at least their Priests) grew
so covetous, that they could not be satia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
without the bloud of Beasts; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
men began to offer up Sheep, Oxen,
and almost all manner of Beasts, to one God
or other; who at length, like corrupt Judges,
were not to be bribed but at high rates,
especially where either the petitioner was
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59675:20"/>
a Rich man, or the Boon sued for very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable,
or the God one of the better sort:
in such a case Sheep were despised, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
less than an Ox would be accepted.
Thus by degrees they grew to such excess,
that at length in case of a publick Pestilence,
or upon some great Warlike undertaking,
it was not unusual to offer <hi>Hecatombs,</hi> that
is, an hundred Oxen, an hundred Sheep, and
as many Swine, all at once upon a hundred
several Altars. But to exceed all this, some
grew to Sacrifice men and women: The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Galli</hi> used to feed a man sumptuously
for the space of one year, and then upon a
Festival day, they carried him out of the
City and stoned him to death, as an Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for the sins of the people. Also <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius
Tyanaeus</hi> thought to stop the Plague at
<hi>Ephesus,</hi> by sacrificing a poor old Beggar.
Nay some went further than this, and sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
their own Children: thus <hi>Agamemnon</hi>
upon his undertaking that renowned War of
<hi>Troy,</hi> offer'd up his only Daughter <hi>Iphigenia;</hi>
and if he could have procured one of the
Gods themselves, it is very probable he
would have sacrificed him to <hi>Jupiter</hi> or
<hi>Mars,</hi> for the better success in his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize.</p>
               <p>We read in ancient History of many Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
who sacrificed their own lives to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiate
the Gods to their Countries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as <hi>Codrus,</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:59675:21"/>
for the <hi>Athenians; Menaeceus,</hi> for the <hi>Thebans;
Anchorus,</hi> for the <hi>Sydonians;</hi> as also <hi>Curtius</hi>
and the two <hi>Decii,</hi> for the <hi>Romans,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
you may read at large in <hi>Livy's</hi> 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book.
Thus Humane Sacrifices grew every where
so common, that in <hi>Mexico</hi> 20000 men in
a year were frequently slain upon their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars;
for the more brutish and unnatural
cruelties they used, the more prevalent
they thought them with Heaven; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they have usually been crown'd with
the most success; perhaps supposing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentional
piety, to prevail above the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
act; or rather, that the general
confidence of the Gods assistance to be
thereby procured, might raise a more than
ordinary vigour in the Souldiers minds,
which is the chief cause of Victory. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when they were ready to joyn Battle
with the enemy, it was usual to make some
Vow to the Gods for their assistance; which
when the other party understood, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
out-vow'd the former, in hopes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to win the Gods from them, or at least to
make the Souldiers believe they had: thus
the <hi>Crotoniatae</hi> in their War against the <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crenses,</hi>
Vow'd to <hi>Apollo</hi> the tenth of the
spoil, if he would give them victory: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the <hi>Locrenses</hi> to outvie them, vow'd
to the same God the ninth part if he would
be on their side, and that re-vie carried it.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59675:21"/>
Also the <hi>French</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonicus</hi>
against <hi>Flaminius,</hi> vow'd to <hi>Mars</hi> a
great Gold Chain; but <hi>Flaminius</hi> to out-bid
them, vow'd to erect a magnificent Trophy,
and so prevail'd. Much like the story of a
corrupt Judge, who being bribed with a Jar
of Oyl, the other party came the next day
and presented him with a fat Ox, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he gave sentence for the Ox; and
when the Oyl-man murmur'd, the Judge to
excuse the business told him, that in the place
where the Jar of Oyl stood, an unruly Ox
brake in and overturn'd it, so as it was quite
forgotten. And many times their Prayers
were in themselves so wicked and execrable,
as could never hope for a reception, unless
usher'd in with a very tempting Oblation:
<q>
                     <l>Da mihi fallere, da justum, sanctum<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>
                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan> videri,</l>
                     <l>Noctem peccat is, &amp; fraudibus objice nubem.</l>
                     <bibl>Horat.</bibl>
                  </q>
This Prayer one would think needed an <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catomb</hi>
at least to render it passable; but
their Gods unwilling to let their Altars
grow cold, would sometimes like Country-Attornies,
rather take small fees than none
at all, to assist them in their Frauds.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="13" type="section">
               <head>XIII.</head>
               <p>Now as there were Sacrifices to obtain
things of the Gods, and Peace-offerings
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59675:22"/>
to appease their supposed wrath and fury;
so also were there others of thanksgiving,
for Benefits receiv'd: thus the <hi>Thurii</hi> made
a solemn Sacrifice to the North-wind, for
having dispers'd and sunk the great Fleet
which <hi>Dyonisius</hi> had sent to invade their
Country. But these kinds of Sacrifices were
most practised in private Families, and
therefore may rather be call'd <hi>Gentilitia</hi> than
<hi>Sacra popularia:</hi> of this sort were the <hi>Sacra
Clodiae, Aemiliae, Julianae, Corneliae gentis,
&amp;c.</hi> mention'd in <hi>Tully</hi> and others; which
private <hi>Sacra</hi> were made perpetual by the
Laws, and so recommended to Posterity.
Now because they were not only chargable
but to be continued from Age to Age as
long as the said Family or Inheritance lasted,
therefore Purchasers were glad <hi>adire haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditatem,</hi>
or to get such a living as was not
clogg'd with these entail'd Sacrifices; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which, you may find a merry pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
in <hi>Plautus,</hi> where a Parasite brags that
he had gotten an Inheritance <hi>sine sacris, sine
sumptu, &amp;c.</hi> but however, there were not
so many of these Thanksgiving Sacrifices, as
of the other; for as much as all men are
naturally inclin'd to covet and wish well to
themselves, but few are so generous as
when their turns are serv'd, to give thanks,
especially if it put them to charge: for thus
we see many many men will be mighty
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59675:22"/>
charitable in giving their blessing, good
advice, or ghostly counsel, who neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
will not part with a farthing of money.
The base ingratitude of mankind, is in a just
proportion represented in the ten Lepers;
where although the reward expected for
their Cure, was only an honest acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
in a few words, yet when they
had all they desir'd, and needed no more,
there was but one in ten would trouble

               <p>Men may wonder why the Heathen Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
did so highly extoll Sacrifices, to appease
Divine wrath against sinners, and so little
mention or make use of Repentance: But
the Reasons of most obvious conjecture
were two: First, they could not but observe
how fickle a creature man is, he seldom
holds long in a humour or resolution, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if it goes against the grain of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
inclinations: so as in effect, most men
do but like little Children, who having
committed a fault, will (to avoid whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping)
say they will do so no more, but do
it again the next hour: this made Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
seem to them but formal, if not
hypocritical; and although the intention of
amendment of life were for the time in some
earnest, for <hi>stultus semper incipit vivere,</hi> and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59675:23"/>
so they may, like dying men in a dangerous
fit of sickness, vow to become new men:
Yet considering how frequent and certain
their Relapses were, it seem'd almost a
mockery, or at the best, such carelesness
as is hardly to be extenuate by the term of
Humane frailty, but rather a downright
effect of incredulity; and if so, it were
then a very improper Oblation to be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
from their Clergy, who lived by
the credulity of men. For certainly if men
did really and seriously believe what they
pretend, or what by fits they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
think they do believe they could
never live as they do; so that want of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
is the only thing which destroys all
Religion, both true and false. The other and
principal motive which induced the crafty
Heathen Priests rather to promote Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
than Repentance, was for that they
were to be managed by none but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and so besides the great Profit they
brought them, they also rendred them of
absolute and perpetual use to the people;
for they could never be laid aside, as being
the only men who by their Oblations could
meditate with Heaven for them: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in Repentance they were altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern'd,
a broken and contrite heart
was a Peace-offering which every man
could bring for himself, without the Priests
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59675:23"/>
assistance, or any gain accruing to them
thereby.</p>

               <p>Unless it were in <hi>Japan,</hi> I do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to have read of any place where they
assumed the Office of Confessors, with
power to absolve sinners; which peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
if they had presumed to claim, and
could have obtain'd, might have brought
them in as great a Reverence as any kind of
Oblation whatever; but they eithr thought
not of it, or it may be these great Officers
the <hi>Censores Morum</hi> would not admit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
for that it was ever found true, <hi>Facile
itur ad peccatum ubi venalis est gratia;</hi> es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
Rich men would not care how vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
they were, knowing they had where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal
to procure Absolution when they
pleased: so that the Poor seem'd in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
predestinate to damnation, or Gods Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
as the <hi>Turks</hi> call them; who for that
Reason will very seldom relieve them.</p>
               <p>He that would ask, what the ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
of the Heathens was? it may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
him, that it was their Sacrifices;
which varied according to the several man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of each Country. Now however all
Sacrifices seem to be the invention of Priests,
yet the <hi>Cruenta</hi> especially; many Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
condemning them, but above all
<hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who said, That men ought to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59675:24"/>
permit no Sacrifice made with slaughter;
and that innocent were not to be slain for
the Gods, such cruelty being rather likely
to aggravate, than extenuate mens other
sins; also that Altars were not to be
imbrued with Bloud. <hi>Porphiry</hi> likewise
saith, That in ancient times it was thought
a great crime to kill any harmless innocent
Beasts, they being intercommoners with
men on Earth: And many besides him were
of that opinion; as thinking it enough to
take from the Sheep her Fleece, from the
Cow her Milk, and from the Ox his Labour,
without robbing them of their Lives. The
killing of Animals in Sacrifice, was how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
thought to be very proper for Feasting;
they might also not without some good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
be offer'd to their Gods, as to whom
they ow'd their Food. The matter of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
in general, was Flesh, Fish, and
Fowl, as also whatsoever did afford savoury
and wholsom sustenance. But amongst all
the <hi>Cruenta Sacrificia,</hi> the most ancient
seems to be that of Swine, who for the tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
they made upon Agriculture, were
offer'd to <hi>Ceres</hi> the Goddess thereof, as we
may learn from this line of <hi>Ovid:</hi>
                  <q>Prima Ceres avidae gavisa est sanguine Porcae</q>
Now these <hi>Cruenta Sacrificia</hi> were used not
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59675:24"/>
only for Thanksgiving, but also for Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their sins; as likewise for assembling
of the people together to make good Chear,
and bring in Roast-meat for the Priests:
Nor were Feasts uneffectual for the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
of the worship of their Gods in the
minds of men; since at all Entertainments,
the Company are naturally apt to drink
the Founders health. Sacrifices, especially
the <hi>Cruonia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> seem to have been first used
among the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and from them
derived to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as <hi>Theodoret</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses;
observing only, that whereas the
<hi>Aegyptians</hi> sacrificed either to Daemons or
Idols, the <hi>Israelites</hi> through the Divine
permission were allow'd to offer them to
God. St. <hi>Jerom</hi> also upon the words of
<hi>Jeremiah</hi> (chap 7. ver. 21.) saith, That
God at last did allow the use of Sacrifices to
himself, lest otherwise they should be made
to false Gods: whereupon also he notes,
that <hi>Moses</hi> never commanded the use of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
but by the way of tolerating them
after the <hi>Israelites</hi> were come out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
where the sweetness of Sacrifices seems first
to have been found out; for not only their
Bellies, but also their Backs profited by them;
<hi>tunicae pelliceae,</hi> or Coats of Skins being their
usual garments: for which reason the <hi>Cruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
Sacrificia</hi> were most esteem'd of all others.</p>

               <p>There are many general things observable
in all or most of their Offerings, and of
mystical signification; as this: That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
their Gods were notoriously guilty
of Fraud, Rapine, and Violence, yet above
all other Oblations they delighted most in
Creatures meek and harmless, as Doves,
Sheep, and Oxen; which were not only
better meat for their Priests, than Lyons and
Tygers, or the like, but also served for
an Emblem; to shew that soft and innocent
Natures were ordain'd for a prey to the
fraudulent, rapacious and violent: in the
observation whereof, the wise Spectators
instructed themselves to their own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
and safety. Much to this purpose
was that saying of an Ancient Father,
<hi>Omnes nos sumus aut Corvi qui lacerant, aut
Cadavera quae lacer antur;</hi> according to our
English Proverb, he who makes himself a
Sheep, becomes a prey to the Woolf. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Mahomet</hi> to make his Disciples all
Wolves, delivers this Impious Doctrine,
That he who forgives an injury does well,
but he who revenges it does better: sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
that a constant Revenge for injuries,
would in time make men more wary of
committing them, and by consequence ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
Morality. Also <hi>Machiavil's</hi> design
being to render his Disciples so rapacious,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59675:25"/>
that they might be able to encounter the
worst of men, he is by the ingenious <hi>Bocaline</hi>
in his <hi>Parnassus,</hi> resembled to a man that
driving a flock of Sheep into a Corner, did
there take out their own Teeth, and in their
stead, gave each of them a set of Wolves
Teeth; so that whereas before one Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
was able to drive a whole Flock, now
each Sheep hath need of particular Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,
and all little enough too. Much to
our purpose is it noted by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that
great Princes in their Shields do ever give
Creatures of Force and Rapine, as Eagles,
Lyons, Dragons, and the like, to teach
them how to maintain their Grandeur: in
resemblance whereof, <hi>Henry</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of
<hi>France</hi> had ever engraven upon his Ordnance
this Motto, <hi>Ratio ultima Regum;</hi> but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
for petty Princes, a Fox may be the
better Emblem.</p>

               <head>XVII.</head>
               <p>These Sacrifices upon extraordinary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
were ever presented with wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Solemnity and Magnificence; for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to St. <hi>Paul's</hi> observation, they hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we were the Off-spring of the Gods,
might probably conjecture that our great
delight which we take in solemn Shows
and Musick, might be originally derived
into our Natures, from the like Spirit in the
Divine Original of Nature, of whom we
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59675:26"/>
proceed: and if so, then these kind
of Solemnities seem proper Sacrifices
to the <hi>Genius</hi> of mankind, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
would at least take with men,
if not with God. However, they were
found to work two great effects upon
peoples minds: the one, of concern to
Religion; the other, to the State. The
concern as to Religion was, in raising
a kind of Veneration and awful Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
in the Spectators; which is a frame
of Spirit most susceptible of Devotion,
excluding all wandring, light and vain
thoughts. Therefore in the most anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
times, the chief part of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
worship was celebrated in thick
Groves; and afterwards when they
erected Temples, many of them were
of magnificent structure, but ever so
gloomy and dark, as they were in the
day time fain to make use of Lamps
upon their Altars; for such a Light
represents any Show much more splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly
than open day-light: As we plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
see in our Theatres, who but for
that advantage, would never be at the
charge of Lamps and Candles in the
Summer time. These stately Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of their Offerings, with the
Priests fantastical Vestments and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
Gravity, was a kind of Acting
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59675:26"/>
their Religion as it were upon a Stage;
and it fared also with that as with
<hi>Opera</hi>'s, which ever take better Acted,
than Read: <hi>Segnius irritant animos de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missa
per aures, quam quae sunt oculis sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecta
fidelibus.</hi> The whole History of
most of their Gods, was at the time of
their several Festivals very splendidly
Acted after the manner of publick Plays,
and generally in dumb-shows, without
any words at all; as supposing every
one from his Childhood acquainted with
the Story by his Religious education.
These Shows upheld their fabulous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
many thousand years, perhaps
much longer than if they had ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it upon Argumentative discourses and
Syllogisms, which are knacks that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
take not the multitude at all, or
never hold them long: for either the
cares of the World stifle them, or at
best after a time they grow as tedious
as a Fiddler that can play but one
Tune. Besides, these frequent Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
were no less effectual to strengthen
the peoples Faith, than if they heard
the Articles of their Faith daily rehears'd
unto them; which is the most preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
way of Naturalizing a Religion
to the people, how false soever: since
nothing is more frequent, than to have
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59675:27"/>
men tell Lyes (though of their own
inventions) so often, till in time they
themselves grow to believe them true.</p>

            <div n="18" type="section">
               <head>XVIII.</head>
               <p>The other concern, <hi>viz.</hi> of the State
in those great Sanguinary Sacrifices, was
by innuring the People to such horrid and
bloudy Sights, which though but of Beasts,
yet doubtless tended much to the hardning
of their hearts against all apprehensions of
bloud and death, either in themselves or
others; rendring them fitter for the Wars,
and thereby more capable either of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
or enlarging their Empire. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this consideration it is, that our Laws
will not admit a Butcher to serve upon the
Jury of Life and Death: Also at the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
of <hi>Edgehill</hi> it was generally observ'd,
that one Foot-Regiment of Butchers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved
themselves more stoutly than any
other Regiment of either side; and yet
they had never before that time been
flesh'd in any bloud but that of Beasts.
To this purpose therefore the ancient <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
did much harden the hearts of their
men, by using them to various other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane
bloudy Sights: as Gladiators
slaughtering one another in their Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theatres;
and condemning Malefactors
to be there torn in pieces by wilde Beasts,
for the diversion of the People: which
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59675:27"/>
occasion'd the Primitive Church to prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
the Christians all such bloudy Sights,
as not intending or approving of such
hardness of heart, but rather choosing
to govern in the Spirit of meekness and
innocence, hoping thereby to gain a
greater submission: whereas the Heathen
Princes (especially the <hi>Romans</hi>) when
they arrived to that Grandeur as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
them into an ambition of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
the Universe, desired in pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of that wicked design, to educate
their people in such fierceness and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity
as might fit them for that
purpose And the Heathen Priests (who
were certainly the wickedest and craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiest
of men) knowing how service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
they might be to the Prince, as
well as the Prince to them, in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotick
Government, soon discover'd
their own interest, in being contributers
to that design.</p>

               <p>Now considering these things, and where
all regard of God and Nature was said
aside, the use of their Sacrifices could not
but be very pertinent; and apprehended
that way, were not so absurd as by <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>
and other ingenious persons they
are represented to have been. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people were so weak, as to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59675:28"/>
into the belief of these Trumpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
by that fallacious Argument which
all Superstitions have ever made use of,
and indeed lyes as well for one as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>(viz.)</hi> that the vulgar Faith was
the safest. But however, the great and
prudent men among them were not so
sottish and blind, as not to discern the
intrinsick worthlessness of their Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
however they upheld them for
worldly advantage; and therefore when
a <hi>Roman</hi> General deferr'd to give the
signal of a Battel, because the Soothsay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
Chickens forbore to eat; a young
Nobleman standing by, told him, He
wondred he would omit so great an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
for so small a thing: to whom
the General reply'd, These things seem
small, but our Fore-fathers by regarding
these little things, have made this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
great. And to shew that
when they were not under these politick
corruptions, but free to declare their own
Judgments, their inward Devotion was
more excellent than their outward Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
observe what one of their own
Poets delivers concerning Sacrifices:
