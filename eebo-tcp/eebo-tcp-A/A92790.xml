         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Verifying, in the very letter, that Promiſe, <hi>Whoſoever will ſave his life, ſhall loſe it: and whoſoever will loſe his life for my ſake, ſhall find it:</hi> Mat. 16. 25. (as here the true Proteſtants did, who gave themſelves up for dead men, rather than turn Papiſts to ſave their lives; and yet were miraculouſly ſaved: when, at the ſame time, the Rotten unſound Proteſtants, who, at that Pinch, turn'd Papiſts to ſave their lives, yet periſhed.</head>
            <byline>Written by <hi>Mercurius Hibernicus,</hi> an Ey-witneſs of the Proteſtants Miſeries, and of the Papiſts Treacheries in <hi>Ireland;</hi> from whom expect ſeveral ſheets to the ſhame of Popery.</byline>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OW are the Daies, doubtleſs, whereof Chriſt and his Apoſtles forewarn'd us; <hi>That there ſhould be a departing or falling away from the Faith:</hi> (1 Tim. 4. 1. 2 Pet. 3. 3. Jude 18.) <hi>and that becauſe of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities abounding, the love of many ſhould wax cold,</hi> Matth. 24. 12. Cold for Chriſt, and the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion; Nay, <hi>They ſhall even deny Chriſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 1. 2 Tim. 2. 12. And theſe things, with many more are come to paſs at this very day.</p>
            <p>And this hath proceeded from the curſed deſign of the JESUITES, and the reſt of the Romiſh Faction, who debauch many great Ones, and they, by their wicked Example (which almoſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the ſorce of a Command with it) the whole Comonalty, (by deluding them with pretences of Venial ſins, and Pardons, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> For is not Whoring, Swaring, Drunkning, Lying, Aequivocating, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> become as a mighty Stream overflowing the whole Land, thereby fitting us for ſome worſe Judgment, if the Plague, the Fire, and other Puniſhments we have had, do no good upon us. Therefore be ſteadfaſt: How dreadful is it to conſider, and what a ſure Token of approaching Judgment is it, to ſee</p>
            <p n="1">I. Many <hi>quandam</hi> zealous Proteſtants, grown of late ſo cold, (colder ſince the PLOT than before) ſo narrow ſpirited and baſely timorous, (thinking 'tis a great piece of diſcretion, and that they ſhew an emphatical piece of Wiſdom) That when Diſcourſe is raiſed in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, concerning POPERY, they will either ſhift it off with a Drool, force ſome other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, or ſneak away, in hopes to ſave their Bakon, <hi>(cujus contrarium verum eſt,)</hi> ſo that, real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they are aſham'd, or half afraid to own themſelves Proteſtants: Shewing not ſo mch zeal for the true Worſhip of the true God, as a <hi>Turk</hi> does for <hi>Mahomets,</hi> or a <hi>Heathen</hi> for his <hi>Idol:</hi> hereby declaring that they have ſat under a dead Miniſtry, of whom God hath ſaid, <hi>They ſhall not profit the People.</hi> Thoſe that never felt the Power of God, under an Ordinance, in turning them from all Sin, and ſhewing them the deſperateneſs of their Condition without Chriſt, a holy Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will turn to any, the worſt of prevailing Religions, eſpecially to that which tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerates Sin, as Popery do's: nay, makes it meritorious, as murdering Kings, burning Cities, &amp;c!</p>
            <p n="2">II. Others are ſo puſillanimous, ſo dirty, and daſtardly; That they dare not own the Truth, when they hear it traduced and impugned by men popiſhly affected: when e'n the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God and their own Conſciences prompt them to ſpeak: as if they were aſham'd of Chriſt, (See <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 38.) and with <hi>Spira,</hi> deſperately quench and reſiſt the Motions of the Holy Ghoſt: and if any put them to it by Interrogatories, they'l anſwer with an Equivocation, or an <hi>Italian</hi> ſhrug: Know, they that dare not Speak for Chriſt, will hardly either Do or Suffer for him; Theſe are light Wheat, that will ſoon be blown aſide, if the Wind riſes a little: eſpecially, if <hi>Euroclydon</hi> blow hard.</p>
            <p n="3">III. There is alſo another ſort, who, tho they will talk pretty freely concerning the PLOT, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet their words are ſo cunningly and artificially placed, as if they were coin'd on purpoſe: Yea their Expreſſions are many times ſo ambiguous, and ſavoring of the JESUITS canting Querks, that the wiſeſt Man alive can hardly tell what to make of them: and all theſe three aim at the ſame thing, <hi>viz.</hi> hoping, by Silence, Indifferency, and Neutrality, to find favour of the Papiſts, if they ſhould get uppermoſt; which is the greateſt Folly imaginable: as I could evince by many woful Examples, in the Rebellion, in <hi>Ireland</hi> where they were moſt egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly perfidious, promiſing the Proteſtants quarter, but in ſtead thereof murdered them in cold Blood: And this one Relation, ſhall ſerve in ſtead of many, whereby you may ſee, if you will, what you are to expect when they have the Sword, <hi>&amp;c. Take it faithfully as I receiv'd it from Captain</hi> Edward Leventhorp, <hi>and others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>DUring the late Wars in <hi>Ireland,</hi> A Caſtle well mann'd with Engliſh, Proteſtants, being ſuddenly and ſtraightly beſieged by the Enemy, in ſo much, that in few daies, they were reduced to ſo great Extremity, that they muſt of neceſſity either ſtarve, or yield to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the mercileſs and implacable Papiſts (whoſe <hi>tender Mercies are Cruelty;</hi> as all along the <hi>Maryan</hi> Dayes, the Troubles in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion hath been proved.)</p>
            <p>Hereupon, the Day and Hour being appointed whereon they ſhould march out of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, without any thing, ſave only their wearing Clothes: Theſe Noble Souls (I call them ſo for their Magnanimity for the Cauſe of Jeſus Chriſt) came out of the Caſtle, and as ſoon as ever they came forth, ſo ſoon were they ſurrounded by the Enemy; as you ſee in this Figure: who, with drawn ſwords in their hands, waited only for the Word of Command to fall on, and cut them in pieces: whilſt, the other poor Souls were upon their Knees, one while calling upon God for Mercy, and another while crying to their Enemies for Pity: but the Papiſts had ſworn the Ruine of them all, and had done it too, if GOD by a ſtrange and wonderful way had not prevented it. For, juſt as the Commander was about to give the Word, to fall on, and ſpare none of the Engliſh Soldiers; GOD, I ſay! put it into the Commanders mind, to ask them one Queſtion firſt: and it was this, He demanded if there were any <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> among them? if there be (ſaid he) let them draw out, and ſeparate from the reſt, who were to ſtand ſtill: The Word was no ſooner out of his Mouth, but out came three or four, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt themſelves <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> and withall antedated their Religion: after them, came half a dozen, and at the heels of them half a ſcore more, and divers others after them, and all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowleding themſelves <hi>Catholicks,</hi> ante-dating, as the firſt did. Whereat the Popiſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander turn'd about and ſmil'd: and when no more would come, he asked the reſt that ſtood Firm, If they were reſolv'd to dye PROTESTANTS? They, (like true Chriſtians, Heaven born Souls indeed) anſwered, <hi>That they would not change their Religion to ſave their LIVES!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Say you ſo? Quoth the Popiſh Commander! But what, I pray, Do'nt you think the others that ſeparated from you good <hi>Catholicks?</hi> No, (ſaid the ſtedfaſt Soldiers) becauſe they ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ver own'd themſelves as ſuch till now, and they do it for fear of Death.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>I verily believe it, (ſaid the Commander) for I thought as much before. Then turning to the reſt of his Officers and Souldiers, he ſaid, Them yonder, meaning thoſe that ſeparated, are but Counterfeit <hi>Catholicks,</hi> and the Rogues do it only to ſave their LIVES, and to abuſe us, for they will run away the next Opportunity: <hi>Therefore, by GOD, they ſhall dy every man of them, and the other for ſtanding ſo bravely to their Principles ſhall live; and whom I would ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner truſt, upon any occaſion, than the other, or any ſuch Time-ſerving Raſcals, as they are!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſhort, he put all the Revolters to the Sword, and ſaved the other for their brave Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution: and not only ſo, but ſent them with a ſafe Conduct to the next Engliſh Garriſon, having as many of his own ſent in Exchange, that had been Priſoners. By this noble Act, the ſaid Commander won great Applauſe amongſt the Engliſh.</p>
            <p>Now, conſider this, all ye that think to ſave your Lives and Eſtates by temporiſing and baſely ante-dating your Religion, or dirtily complying with, and fawning upon every baſe pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful (the moſt of them are no better) Papiſt before hand, as if ye would foreſpeak Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as I am too ſure many do. And poſſibly, you that are next to, removed but one little ſtep from them, may find ſome favour, for a very little time, from them, till you and them, if they can by any idle fooliſh pretence get you to aſſiſt them againſt ſuch as are more zealous againſt their Idolatries: But, when their work is ſo far done, then they will more eaſily cut you off too, for the leaſt ſtep of Reformation ſince <hi>Qu. Maries</hi> daies, their Soul hates, even as the pureſt worſhip. For I can liken them to no better a Crew than Rogues and Thieves that live in an honeſt place; who will carry it very fairly among the Neighbourhood, to have ſom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There are Seven ſorts that above all others are moſt likely to turn Apoſtates, <hi>viz.</hi> The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, the Ambitious, the Self-lovers, the Over-nice, the Formaliſts, the Ignorant and the Fearful.

But God can (and perhaps will) bring it ſo to paſs, That ſuch revolting Wrethes, may be ſerved as they above mention'd: or, if not ſo, yet they cannot eſcape Vengeance: for I am confident they will periſh by one means or other, perchance by the hands of true Proteſtants: And, for my own part, I do profeſs, (if God will make uſe of the Arm of Fleſh, in our defence) I would ſooner give quarter to <hi>French</hi> or any other outlandiſh-Papiſt, than any Engliſh Apoſtate whatſoever (Laity or Clergy) that ſhould joyn in Arms with them, or our domeſtick or home-born Papiſts againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants Cauſe.</p>
            <p>And I write this with an heart that never yet feared the greateſt or the proudeſt Papiſt in the World: who have been at the routing of ſuch, almoſt an hundred times, in my junior daies: and therefore, I think, I ſhould know the better how to deal with them now; if they will needs force us to it, by falling upon us firſt: for till then we will not ſtir one foot: Let them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe provoke us never ſo much, as they have done very often, and do daily: beſides burning of <hi>London, Southwark, &amp;c.</hi> But as crafty Fowlers as they are, they ſhall not catch old Birds in the Chaff.</p>

            <bibl>1 Cor. 16. 13.</bibl>
            <p>For, In all Gods Armory, there's no defence for the Back, the Runagade, the Apoſtate muſt everlaſtingly periſh. O Apoſtate bethink thy ſelf betimes!</p>
            <q>
               <l>True Proteſtants will rather chuſe to dy,</l>
               <l>Than Chriſt, or their Religion deny:</l>
               <l>And bravely perſevere, come, what will come,</l>
               <l>But Hypocrites will bow the Knee to Rome,</l>
               <l>Ev'n theſe 7 Monſters, which I nam'd before,</l>
               <l>Would Popery, if it were up, adore.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all this, Let us, and all that think they ſtand, beware leſt we fall, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 12.) as they may, without Divine Aſſiſtance: Self-Confidence being a moſt dangerous Rock on which many have ſplit, even in this preſent Age: Remember the Apoſtle <hi>Peter:</hi> and the Apoſtate <hi>Pendleton,</hi> in the Book of Martyrs.</p>
