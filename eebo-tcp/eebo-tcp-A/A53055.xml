            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN EPISTLE To justifie the LADY NEW CASTLE, AND Truth against falshood, laying those false, and malicious aspersions of her, that she was not Authour of her BOOKS.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Would willingly begin with the common, and Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable rode of Epistles, <hi>Gentle Readers,</hi> but finding you much otherwise, I will fall to our discourse in hand. First 'tis but your envious Supposition that this Lady must have converst with many Scholers of all kindes in learning, when 'tis well known the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that she never convert with any profest Shooler in learning, for to learn, neither did she need it, since she had the conversation of her Honorable, and most learned Brother from her cradle; and since she was married, with my worthy and learned Brother; and for my self I have lived in the great world a great while, and have thought of what has been brought to me by the senses, more then was put into me by learned discourse; for I do not love to be led by the nose, by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and old Authours, <hi>ipse dixit</hi> will not serve my turn, were <hi>Aristotle</hi> made a more Philosophical Bible then he is, and all scholers to have a lively faith in him, doth not move me to be of their Philosophical churche at all. And I assure you her conversation with her Brother, and Brother-in-law, were enough without a miracle or an impossibility to get the language of the arts, and learned professions, which are their terms, without taking any degrees in Schooles. It is not so difficult a thing though they make mountains of mole-hills, &amp; say they, thatthis Lady useth many termes of
<pb facs="tcp:48875:3"/>
the Schooles; but truly she did never Impe her high-flying Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, with any old broken Fethers out of any university; and if you read well, which is to understand, and look on her Poems, you will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap> they are all new born Phansies, never toucht of heretofore. But for the rarity of the terms, or nests of Divines, Philosophers, Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Geometricians, Astrono mers, and the rest of the Gown-Tribe, as one tearms them, how is it possible she should know them; And first for Divinity, when she speaks of Predestination, Free-will, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, and consubstantiation; truly these termes are not so hard to be got by heart as to be understood, since I beleeve it puzzels the learned to make sense of them. But I beseech you give this Lady so much ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, as to get them by heart, since every Tub-preacher discourses of them, and every sanctified wife gossips them in wafers, and hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cris at every Christening. Next are the termes of the Philosophers, Certainly 'tis no Conjuration to conceive Atomes, invisible, and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible bodies, elements, earth, air, water and fire, whereof your ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary fire under the moon is much doubted of, and then you have but three elements. Motion is a difficult thing indeed, to understand the varietes of it, but certainly not of a body moved, that's no such transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent thing. Dilation a spreading, Contraction a gathering together Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rificationthinning, and Condensation thickning; I confesse in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine it seems very learned, but in the English very vulgar, there-fore I beseech you give this Lady leave to have the wit, and the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to understand these Great no mysteries. And put the case now that this Lady should name <hi>materia prima,</hi> -and understand the English of it to be first matter, and ask her friend again what they mean by it, and he tells her they say they mean matter without form, and she should answer, there is no matter without some form, so <hi>materia prima</hi> are two Latine words that mean nothing. An incorporeal substance is too learned to be understood, so that is waved. Now for the termes of Physicians, when she speaks of Choler, Phlegme, Melancholy and Blood, and of Ventricles in the heart and brain, of veines, arteries and nerves, and discourses of fevers, apoplexies, convulsions, Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, and divers other diseases with their particular causes, symptoms and cures; how should this Lady understand these terms say some? truly a good Farmers wife in the country, by seeing one of her sheep opened, may well understand the tearms of most of these, and a Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles wife of a hundred in <hi>Essex</hi> that useth Physick and Surgery may well talk of the diseases, without any great learned mystery, they are so plain and so common, as none needsto construe Greek in <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> or <hi>Galen</hi> for them. But would you know how we know the great Mystery of these Physical terms, I am almost ashamed to tell you; not that we have been ever sickly, but by Melancholy often supposed our selves to bave such diseases as we had not, and learned Physitians were too wise to put us out of that humour, and so these tearms cost us much more then they are Worth, and I hope there is no body so malicious, as to envie our bargain, neither truly do I repent my bargain, since Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians are the most rational men I have converst with all, and my worthy and very good friends, and truly this Lady never converst with
<pb facs="tcp:48875:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
any Physitian of any disease, but what she thought she had her self, neither hath she converst with many of that profession. Now for the great learning of knowing the terms of Geometricians, when this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy touches upon Triangles, Squares, Circles, Diameters, Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, Centers, lines straight and crooked &amp;c. I will not dissect these great mysteries, because they are so very common, as the meanest under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands all these termes, even to Joyners and Carpenters, therefore sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this Lady is capable of them.</p>
            <p>Then of Astronomers, say they, when she speak's of the Horizon, Meridian, Equator, Zodiack, Eclyptick, Tropicks, Poles of the world &amp;c. When these termes are understood thats their meaning, they are no such subtilties, since every boy may be taught them, with an apple for the Globe, and the parings for the sphears, it is so ridiculous then to think that this Lady cannot understand these tearms, as it is rather to be laught at, then to trouble ones self to answer. And that invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Problem, the quadrature of the circle, as they call it, which makes me doubt that they think themselves wiser, for naming the quadrature, then squaring the circle, who lives that hath not heard of it, and who lives that can do it, and who is dead that hath done it, and put the case it were done, what then? why then 'tis squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and that's all, and that all is nothing, much ado about nothing. But we will leave these impertinent, malicious, and most false ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions to the Lady, and her Books, and will now begin with her book of Poems, examining first her Philosophy there. Thats an old o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of Atomes, say some, witnesse <hi>Democrates</hi> and many others; Tis very true they have talkt of atomes, but did they ever dispose of them as they are there, or tell you what several sorts there are of them, and what figure they bear, and being joyned, what forms they produce of all kindes, in all things, if you have read any such things before, i'le be bold to burn the Book. Why then all these are new opinions, and grounded upon Reason, I say some, but they are Paradoxes, what then? I hope a Paradox may be as true as an old opinion, and an old opinion as false as a Paradox, for neither the one nor the other makes a truth, either the new or the old, for what is most reason &amp; reasonable; for in natural Philosophy, one opinion may be as true as another, since no body knows the first cause in nature of any thing. Then this Ladies Philosophy is excellent, and will be thought so hereafter, and the truth is that it was wholy, and onely wrought out of her own brain, as there are many witnesses, by the several sheets that she sent daily to be writ fair for the presse. As for her Poems, where are the exceptions to these? marry they misse sometimes in the numbers and in the rimes. It is well known by the copies, that those faults lie most upon the Corrector, and the Printer; but put the case there might be some slips in that kinde, is all the book damned for it, no mercy Gentlemen? when for the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, every Schoole-boy can make them on his fingers, and for Rimes <hi>Fenner</hi> would have put down <hi>Ben. Johnson,</hi> and yet neither the boy or <hi>Fenner</hi> so good Poets. No, it is neither of those either makes, or condemns a Poet, it is new born and creating Phansies that Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
<pb facs="tcp:48875:4"/>
a Poet, and in her Book of Poems, I am sure there is excellent, and new Phancies, as have not been writ by any, and that it was onely writ by her is the greatest truth in the world. Now for her Book called the Worlds Olio, say some, how is it possible that she showld have such experience, to write of such things so; I answer, that I living long in the great world, and having the various fortunes of what they call good and bad, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap> the reading of men might bring me to as much experience as the reading of Books, and this I have now and then discourst unto this Lady, who hath wisely and elegantly drest it in her own way, and sumptuously cloathed it, at the charge of her own Phancies and expressions; I say some of them she hath heard from me, but not the fortieth part of her book, all the rest are absolutely her own in all kindes, this is an ingenious truth, therefore beleeve it. As for the Book of her Philosophical opinions, there is not any one thing in the whole Book, that is not absolutely spun out by her own studious phancy, and if you will lay by a little passion against writers, you will like it, and the best, of any thing she has writ, therefore read it once or twice, not with malice to finde a little fault, but with judgement to like what is good. Truly I cannot beleeve so unworthily of any Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, honouring them so much as we both do, that they should envie this Lady, or should have so much malice or emulation, to cast such false as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persions on her, that she did not write those Books that go forth in her name, they will hardly finde out who else writ them, and I protest none ever writ them but her self; You should rather incourage her, then by false suppositions to let her see the world is so ill natured, as to beleeve fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoods before truths. But here's the crime, a Lady writes them, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench so much upon the male prerogative, is not to be forgiven; but I know Gown-men will be more civil to her, because she is of the Gown too, and therefore I am confident you will defend her and truth, and thus be undeceived. I had not troubled you with this, but that a learned Doctor, our very noble friend, writ is word of the infidelity of some people in this kinde; whatsoever I have write is absolutly truth, which I here as a man of Honour set my hand to.</p>

            <p>As for Chapters, there are many misplaced, for some Chapters that belong to that part of diseases, are misplaced among those of natural Philosophy, as one that belongs to sleep, and three Chapters that are of the temper of Aire; likewise another Chapter of the strength of the soul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is placed between the first and last part of the Common-Wealth, which nothing belongs to it: for though there is a soul and body belonging to every Common-Wealth, yet not such a soul and body as I have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courst of there.</p>
            <p>For the soul of a Common-Wealth is Actuall Justice, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry.</p>
            <p>The soul of a man is Contemplation, Reason, and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And the body of a Common-Wealth, is the Citizens therein, and Magistrates thereof.</p>
            <p>And the body of a man is the senses therein, and the members thereof.</p>
            <p>Likewise the strength of a Common-Wealth is the Laws.</p>
            <p>And the strength of a mans body is the nerves.</p>
            <p>Likewise a short copie of verses which is at the latter end of the book, is what I intended for this book, as being my beloved of all my works, prefering it as my master-piece, although I do beleeve it will not please my Readers, because as I have said in some of my Epistles, few take delight in the study of Natural Philosophy, yet those that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light not, or slight the study, or dispraise the work, make it not the lesse rational, for reason will be reason in the despite of the most malicious detractors or sophsterian censurers, but for the faults and mistakes in my other works, and perchance the like mischance may come to these, and although I know a passion cannot recal an injury past: yet I cannnot but grieve at the misfortune, as for a friend that
<pb facs="tcp:48875:5"/>
should be hurt or lamed by some unhappy accident, but if there be any other faults of indiscretions in it, I the Author am to be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by reason somwhat of it was writ in the dawning of my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and experience, and not having a clear light I might chance to stamble in dark ignorance on molehills of errors; not that I accuse my book of faults; but arm my self with truth against crabbed censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. Likewise I do not lay all the faults in my book to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or Correctors charge, for that would be so great an injustce, as I could never forgive my self for the crime, for the Chapters that are misplaced are through my fault, by reason I sent some part of it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the book was in the presse, and it seems that the Printer or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector not understanding where to place them, put them in a wrong place.</p>
            <p>But the literate faults I lay to their charge, whereof I cannot choose but complain, for in some places it is so falsly printed, as one word alters the sense of many lines; whereby my book is much prejudiced, and not onely by putting in false words, as a costements, for accoutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ungrateful for ungraceful, muster for mufler, and the like; but the significancy of words, to expresse a singular for a plural; yet I must confesse that this book is much truer Printed then my book of Poems, for where this book hath one fault, that hath ten; for which I can forgive the Printer, and Corrector ten times easier then I did for the other, but setting aside the faults of my book, and complaining thereof, I must take the liberty in my own behalf to complain of this ill natured, and unbeleeving age, in not allowing me to be the right Authour thereof; and though it were an endlesse work to answer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very idle and impertinent question, or malicious objection; for I am assured that rational, wise, learned, and just persons will never make a doubt, knowing that nature hath power to temper a brain as she pleaseth both to receive, retain, discuss, and create, yet for truths sake I am willing to satisfie my worthy readers (if I can) although I had thought I had answerd it in my former writings.</p>
            <p>But to answer those objections that are made against me, as first, how should I come by so much experience, as I have expressed in my several books to have? I answer, I have had by relation, the long and much experience of my Lord, who hath lived to see and be in many changes of fortunes, and to converse with many men of sundry nations, ages, qualities, tempers, capacities, abilities, wits, humors, fashions and customes.</p>
            <p>And as many others, especially wives go from church to church, from ball to ball, from collation to collation, gossiping from house to house, so when my Lord admits me to his company, I listen with attention to his edifying discourse, and I govern my self by his Doctrine; I dance a measure with the muses, feast with the Sciences, or sit and discourse with the arts.</p>
            <p>The second is, that since I am no Scholer, I cannot know the names and terms of art, and the divers and several opinions of several Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, I answer, that I must have been a natural fool if I had not known and learnt them, for they are customarily taught all children from
<pb facs="tcp:48875:6"/>
their nurses brest being ordinarily discoursed of in every family that is of quality, and the family from whence I sprung are neither natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral idiots, nor ignorant fools, but the contrary, for they were ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, learned, understanding and wittie.</p>
            <p>And when I said I never converst an hour with professed Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers, for indeed in this age, I have not heard of many which do professe it, or an intimate acquaintance or familiar conversation with profest scholers, nor so much discourse as to learn from them, for three or four visits do not make an intimacy, nor familiarity, nor can much be learnd therefrom, for visiting and entertaining dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, for the most part are either cautionary, frivolous, vain, idle, or at least but common and ordinary matter, and most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly all visiting discourses, are after one and the same manner, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the company be several; but I did not think my readers would have been so rigid as to think I excluded my husband, brothers, and the rest of my family, neither are they profest Philosophers nor Scholers, although they are learned therein, or to beleeve I was so ridiculously foolish, or so foolishly vain, or so basely false as that I strive to make the world to beleeve, I had all my experience and knowledge before I was born, and that my native Language came by instinct, and that I was never taught my A, B, C; or the marks and names of several things; but I hope my book hath more spite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enemies then faults; for I have said in an Epistle before the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of my Olio, that if I had never seen nor heard so much as I have done, should never have been able to have writ a book.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that I had taken feathers out of the Universities to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the wings, of my fancy; I answer, no more then <hi>David</hi> took the wooll from his sheeps backs to cloath his Poetical Phancies of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or as I may say his devout Poetry which is drest with simuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</p>
            <p>But it hath been known in several ages, that even poor Peasents that hear nothing but the blating of sheep: the lowing of herds, the crowing of cocks, and the like, and their ordinary discourses of nothing but of their market, or the like, have been high flying Poets, politick states men, wise Governours, prudent Souldiers, subtle Philosophers, excellent Physitians, and what not, even to be eloquent Orators, and Divine preachers, as the holy writ will make manifest to us, and I beleeve many more are mentioned in other Histories of lesse authority; thus we may observe that nature is Prevalent in all qualities and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; And since nature is so generous to distribute to those that fortune hath cast out, and education hath neglected, why should my readers mistrust nature should be sparing to me, who have been honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably born, carefully bred, and nobly married to a wise man, from whom, as I have said in some of my Epistles, in my book called the Worlds Olio, and do here say again, and again, if it will satisfie the Readers that I am my Lords Scholer, and as I have learnt, so I do daily learn knowledge and understanding, wit, and the purity of my language; and let me intre at my Readers to be so just to me, as not to condemn me for an ideot by their objections and doubts, as not beleeving
<pb facs="tcp:48875:6"/>
I am capable of learning, but let me tell my Readers that what I have learned since I was married, it is from my Lord, and what I had learned before it was from wy own familie, as from my own brothers, for my father died when I was young, and not from strangers; for though I have seen much company, yet I have converst with few, and I take conversation to be in talking, which I have not practised very much, unlesse it be to particular friends, for naturally I am so wedded to contemplations, that many times when I have been in company, I had not known one word they have said, by reason my busie thoughts have stopped the sense of my hearing; and though I prefer the delight of contemplation, before the pleasure of the senses, yet when the neerest and dearest of my friends speak, as my husband, brothers, sisters, or their children, my affection is such that I give such an atention to them, as if I had no other thoughts but of what they say, or any other sense but hearing; but as I have said of the names and tearms of art, and the several opinions of the Antients, and the distinguishment of the sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and the like, I learned them from my neerest and dearest friends as from my own brothers, my Lords brother, and my Lord (but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the words and termes of art makes me not a Philosopher) nor a Poet; and if every one in justice ought to have a due, then nature must have a share, and truly I will never be so ingrateful as not to acknowledge her favours, or to belie her in saying she hath not been bountiful to me, for she hath given me such materials, as I hope to build me a monumental fame therewith; but to satisfie my Readers, I will tell them as well as I can how I came to know, and understand passages, all though I never practised, or were a spectator therein, or thereof; as put the case my husband, or brothers should tell me of an Army of horse and foot, and that two Armies encountred, and fought a battle, and expresse the forms and figures, rancks and fiels, the flanck, the wings the vans, the rears, and the like, by which relation to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit I see it in my brain as perfectly, as if the battle was pitcht, and fought there, and my fancy will build discourse therefrom. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise if they should tell me all the parts of an Animal body, and how they are formed and composed, I conceive it as perfectly to my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing as if I had seen it dissected although I never did and therefore may be deceived in my understanding, for truly I have gathered more by piece-meals, then from a full relation, or a methodical educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for knowledge; but my fancy will build thereupon, and make discourse therefrom, and so of every thing they discourse of, (I say they) that is my husband and brothers; For the singularity of my affections are such, that though I have an ill memory, and could not if it were for my life relate word for word of any discourse, if it be any thing long that I shall hear from strangers, for I am the worst repeater of a story from strangers, or out of a book in the World, when from my neer friends (especially my Lord) whose discourses are lively discriptions, I cannot forget any thing they say, such deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions their words print in my brain, when I cannot remember one discourse perfectly from others, were they holy sermons to save my soul.
<pb facs="tcp:48875:7"/>
but as I have said from a bare relation, I can conceive to my think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every particular part, and passage, as if I were a witnesse thereof, or an actor therein; but many things, although I should never have heard of any such thing, yet my natural reason will guide and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to me, the right and the truth.</p>
            <p>For put the case I see a watch, or any other invention, and none should tell me how it was made, yet my natural reason would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how it was made, so in natural things my natural reason will conceive them without being any wayes instructed; and so working a brain I have that many times on small objects or subjects will raise up many several phancies, and opinions therein, from which my discourse betwixt reason and those opinions will be produced; but the truth is, I have more materials to build with, then ground to build on, wherby they become uselesse, but I beleeve time will moulder them to dust, or accidents, as sicknesse may destroy them, as dropsies may drown them, fevers may burn them, consumptions may waste them, or griefs may wither them, or other imployments like usurpers may throw it out of my head, but as yet my head is fully populated with divers opinions, and so many phancies are therein, as sometimes they lie like a swarm of bees in a round heap, and sometimes they flie abroad to gather honey from the sweet flowry rhetorick of my Lords discourse, and wax from his wise judgement which they work into a comb making chapters therein. But those that make these and the like idle objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against me either have not read all my Epistles, and the rest of my books or understands them not, but that is not my fault, but their unjust natures, to censure and condemn before they examine or understand; Nay they do in somethings faulsely, ac cuse, and maliciously break out of some of my Epistles some parts to throw against me, which is most base and cruel to dismember my book tormenting it with spiteful objections, misforming the truth with falshood: but those that have noble and generous souls will beleeve me, and those that have base and mechannick souls, I care not what they say, and truly I would not have troubled my self in striving to satisfie this present age which is very censorious; but fear the future age wherein I hope to live, may be deceived, and I by false constructions wronged; for I have observed that the ignorant, and malicious, do strive to disturb, and obstruct all probable opinions, wittie ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, honest industry, vertuous indeavours, harmlesse phancies, innocent pleasures, and honourable fames although they become infamous thereby.</p>
            <p>Readers I had forgotten to mention the objection, that there is no distinction between a scholer, and a Philosopher, if they mean as being vulgarly called both scholers</p>
            <p>I answer a scholer is to be learnd in other mens opinions, inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and actions, and a philosopher is to teach other men his opinions of nature, and to demostrate the works of nature, so that a scholer is to learn a Philosopher to teach, and if they say there is no distinction between a profest scholer, and a profest philosopher, I am not of their opinion; for a profest scholer in theologie, is not a profest Philosopher; for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines leave nature on the left hand, and walk on the right to things su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
<pb facs="tcp:48875:7"/>
and if they mean profest scholers, as being bred at univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities ( I answer) that I take not all those that are bred at an Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, and those that are learned to be profest scholers, or those that are great Philosophers to be profest, unlesse they make it their profession, as a profest Divine that hath taken Orders, or a profest Physitian that hath commenced Doctor, or profest Pleaders, or Lawyers that are made Barresters, or Philosophers, that teach Scholers; but certainly there are many that are very learned that are not profest, as being of that profession by which they live.</p>
            <p>Likewise an objection for my saying I have not read many Books; but I answer, for not reading of many Authors, had I understood se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Languages, as I do not, , I have not had so much time; had I indeavoured to have been learned threin, for learning requires close studies, long time, and labour.</p>
            <p>Besides, our sex takes so much delight in dressing and adorning themselves, as we for the most part make our gowns our books, our laces our lines, our imbroderies our letters, and our dressings are the time of our studie; and instead of turning over solid leaves, we turn our hair into curles, and our sex is as ambitious to shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the eyes of the world, when finely drest, as Scholers do to expresse their learning to the ears of the world, when fully fraught with Authors.</p>
            <p>But as I have said my head was so full of my own naturai phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, as it had not roome for strangers to boord therein, and certainly natural reason is a better tutor then education; for though education doth help natural reason to a more sudden maturity, yet natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was the first educator; for natural reason did first compose Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealths, invented arts, and sciences, and if natural reason have composed, invented and discoverd, I know no reason, but natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reason may finde out what natural reason hath composed, invented, and discovered, without the help of education; but some may say that education is like mony n put to use, which begets increase; I say it is true, but natural reason is the principal, which without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease could not be, but in truth natural reason, is both the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal and the increase, for natural reason produceth beneficial effects, and findes out the right and the truth, the wrong and the falshood of things, or causes; but to conclude, what education hath not instructed me, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reason hath infor med me of many things.</p>

            <head>AN EPILOGE TO MY PHILOSOPHICAL OPINIONS.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome say that my Book of Philosophy, it seems as if I had converst with <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> or Master <hi>Hobbes,</hi> or both, or have frequented their studies, by reading their works, but I cannot say but I have seen them both, but upon my conscience I never spake to monsieur <hi>De Cartes</hi> in my lise, nor ever understood what he said, for he spake no English, and I understand no other language, and those times I saw him, which was twice at dinner with my Lord at <hi>Paris,</hi> he did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to me a man of the fewest words I ever heard. And for Master <hi>Hobbes,</hi> it is true I have had the like good fortune to see him, and that very often with my Lord at dinner, for I conversing seldom with any strangers, had no other time to see those two famous Philosophers; yet I never heard Master <hi>Hobbes</hi> to my best remembrance treat, or discourse of Philosophy, nor I never spake to Master <hi>Hobbes</hi> twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty words in my life, I cannot say I did not ask him a question, for when I was in <hi>London</hi> I meet him, and told him as truly I was very glad to see him, and asked him if he would please to do me that honour to stay at dinner, but he with great civility refused me, as having some businesse, which I suppose required his absence.</p>
            <p>And for their works, my own foolish fancies do so imploy my time, as they will not give me leave to read their books, for upon my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science I never read more of Mounsieur <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> then half his book of passion, and for Master <hi>Hobbes,</hi> I never read more then a little book called De Cive, and that but once, nor never had any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to read to me, as for their opinions, I cannot say I have not heard of many of them. As the like of others, but upon my conscience not throughly discoursed of, for I have heard the opinions of most Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers in general, yet no otherw aies then if I should see a man, but
<pb facs="tcp:48875:9"/>
neither know his estate, quality, capacity, or natural disposition, thus upon my conscience is a truth, not onely in these two Philosophers, but all Philosophers, and not onely Philosophers, but all their learned men, so that I am no otherwayes learned in writers works, or other opinions then those that onely learned the tearms of arts, and sciences, but know no more. The like they may say of Physitians, as of Philosophers, when they read my opinions of diseases; it is true I have converst with Physitians more then any other learned profession, yet not so much as to increase my understanding, although more then was advantagious for my health, indeed I have been the worst Physitian to my self; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides wise learned men think it a discredit to discourse learnedly to ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant women, and many learned men speak most commonly to women, as women do to children nonsense, as thinking they understand not any thing, or else like those that are of another Language speak such gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brish, to those they would have understood that they understand not themselves yet think those they speak to do conceive them, as if ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance was bound to understand nonsense, that is not to be understood; but I desire my Readers, or censurers; for some will censure that have not read, or at least not understood me, that I did never take nor steal any opinion, or argument from any other as my own, nor never will, and if I hit or light upon the same, it is meer chance. Tis true, I have mentioned many opinions, but not as my own opinions or arguments, but rather, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap> civilly I have been opposite to those opinions I have heard of, and I make no question but if my Readers will take the paines to compare my writings to others, and throughly examine them, they will I make no question, finde great difference; for though other Philosophy have treated of matter, form, and motion, being the fundamental ground, of all all natural Philosophical discourse, yet I believe not my way, nor I never read any book of diseases, or medicines but <hi>Gerrards Herball,</hi> which no question is a very rare book, and cetainly discribes the tempers of herbs, fruits, and drugs very lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly, but I do verily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap> the learning lies more in the tempers then in the applications; for I beleeve where one is rightly applied, forty are falsly applied, and how shall it be otherwaies, unlesse he had studied the motions and tempers of diseases; for one and the same diseases may be of several tempers, and motions, wherefore one and the same simple will not cure one and the same kinde, or rather sort of disease; Wherefore I beseech my readers to be so charitable, and just, as not to bury my works in the monuments of other writers, but if they will bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them, let it be in their own dust, or oblivion, for I had rather be forgotten, then scrape acquaintance, or insinuate my self into others company, or brag of received favours, or take undeserved gifts, or belie noble Benefactors, or to steal, although I were sure the theft would never be discovered, and would make me live eternally.</p>
            <p>But I have no acquaintance with old Authors, nor no familiarity with the moderns, I have received no instructions by learning, and I never owned that which was not justly my own, nor never stole that which was justly anothers, neither have I retained, but plain truth to defend, and conscience towitnesse for me.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:48875:10"/>
            <p>Besides, I have heard that learning spoiles the natural wit, and the fancies, of others, drive the fancies out of our own braines, as enemies to the nature, or at least troublesome guests that fill up all the rooms of the house.</p>
            <p>This opinion, or rather a known truth, was a sufficient cause for me, neither to read many Books, or hear arguments, or to dispute opinions, had I ever been edicted to one, or accustomed to the other, by reason I found a naturall inclination, or motion in my own brain to fancies, and truly I am as all the world is, partial, although perchance, or at least I hope not so much as many are, yet enough to desire that my own fancies, and opinions might live in the world, rather then the fancies and opinions of other mens in my brain.</p>

            <head>AN EPISTLE TO THE Reader, for my Book of Philosophy.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Erchance many that read this book, will hardly understand it, not but it may be as rational, and as probable, as any that have writ before, but unlesse they be contemplary persons, which are not many in our nation, especially in the Protestant opinion, which live not Monastical lives, are not so curious, nor so inquisitive, after nature, as to study that Science; Besides, they think it unprofitable, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no advantage; but they are much mistaken, for that it is a great insight to the knowledge of all Vegetables, Minerals, and Animals, their constitutions, their sympathies, and antipathies, their extractions, and applications which they apply, for health, and prolonging of life; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the study in this Science, brings them acquainted with the course of the stars and planets, and the several tempers of the Climats, and the nature of the several Soyls, which is profitable in husbandry; then it is advantagious for the art of Navigation, and Plantations, and many other things; but above all, this study is a great delight, and pleases the curiosity of mens minds, it carries their thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove vulgar and common Objects, it elevates their spirits to an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring pitch; It gives room for the untired appetites of man, to walk or run in, for so spatious it is, that it is beyond the compasse of time; besides, it gives pleasure in varieties, for infinite wayes are sirawed with infinite varieties, neither doth it binde up man to those strickt rules as other Sciances do, it gives them an honest liberty, and proves temperance is the greatest pleasure in nature. Tis true, moral Philosophy is an excellent study, but the doctrine is too strict for the practise, for it teaches more then can be followed, and Theologie is a glorious study, but the way is difficult and dangerous, for though there are many pathes, yet there is but one that leads to heaven, and those that step awrie fall into the Gulph of damnation, and the deep study in this many times blindes the eyes, both of faith and reason, and instead of uniting mankind with love, to live in peace, it makes discords with controversies, raises up fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to uphold each-side, whose endlesse quarrels are followed with such hatred, and fought with such malice and envie, and the zeal spits so much blood, as if not onely several parties would be rased out, but

the bulk of mankinde; And to study Law, is to study dissention, to study Logick is to study deceit, to make falshood appear like truth; to study Rhetorick is to study words more then sense, and many the like studies are more painful then useful, more time lost then profit got, more tedious then pleasant, more sophistry then truth. Indeed the Mathematicks brings both profit and pleasure to the life of man, it gives just measure and equal weight, it makes all odd reckonings even, it sets all musical notes, it brings concord out of discord, it gives diminution and extention; But as I said before, few or none but Monastical men, which live contemplary lives, despising the vanities of the world, next to the service of God, seek to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with nature, and to observe the course of her works, yet in an humble and respectful manner, as to admire her curiosity, and to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and adore the God of nature, for the wonders they finde by her works, and workings: for this reason, if I had been so learned, I would have put my book into Latine, which is a general language through all Europe, and not have writ it in my native Language, which goeth no further then the kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> wherein I fear my book will finde but little applause; because few therein study na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Philosophy, and what they understand not, they cannot judge of, yet I beleeve all that read will take upon them to give a censure, and what their weak braines is not capable to reach at, their active tongues are capable to pull down, so that I fear me my book will be lost in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blivion, or condemned by ignorance, unlesse some generous disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which hath a genius in natural Philosophy, and learned and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquent in the Latine tongue will translate my work; yet I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my book should die in Oblivion, then to be divulged to disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and instead of cloathing it in a new garment, they will dismember the body of sense, as to put out the natural eyes, and put in glasse eyes in the place, or to cut off the legs, and then set the body upon wooden stumps, but unlesse the Translator hath a genius sutable to the Author of the Original, the Original will be disfigured with mistakes; yet it is easier to translate prose then verse, for rimes, number, and sense, are hard to match in several Languages, it is double labour, and requires double capacitie; for although <hi>Ovid</hi> and <hi>Dubartus</hi> were so happy as to meet a <hi>Sylvester</hi> and a <hi>Sands,</hi> yet very few or no other had the like good fortune in our Language: for this reason I would have turned my Atomes out of verse into prose, and joyned it to this book, but I finding my brain would be like a river that is turned from its natural course, which will neither run so smooth, swift, easie, nor free, when it is forced from its natural motion and course, both which made me desist &amp;c.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Cannot think that the substance of infinite mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is onely a body of dust, such as small atoms, and that there is no solidity, but what they make, nor no degrees, but what they compose, nor no change and variety, but as they move, as onely by fleeing about as dust and ashes, that are blown about with winde, which me thinks should make such uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties, such disproportioned figures, and confused creations, as there would be an infinite and eternal disorder. But surely such wandring and confused figures could never produce such infinite effects; such rare compositions, such various figures, such several kindes, such constant continuance of each kinde, such exact rules, such undissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable Laws, such fixt decrees, such order, such method, such life, such sense, such faculties, such reason, such knowledge, such power, which makes me condemn the general opinions of atoms, though not my particular opinions of the figures, that the long atoms make air, the round water, the flat square earth; also that all the other fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures are partly severed from those; also the measure, and the weight of atoms, of slime, flame, of burning, of quenching of fire, and of the several motions, compositions, and composers in their creating and dissolving of figures; also their wars and peace, their sympathies and antipathies, and many the like; but this opinion of mine is, if the infinite, and eternal matter are atoms, but I have considered that if the onely matter were atoms, and that every atome is of the same degree, and the same quantity, as well as of the same matter; then every atom must be of a living substance, that is innate mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for else they could not move, but would be an infinite dull and immoving body, for figures cannot make motion, unlesse motion be in the matter, and it cannot be a motion that sets them at work without substance, for motion cannot be without substance or produced therefrom, and if motion proceeds from substance, that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is moving innately, but if motion is nothing, then every several nothings, which are called several motions, are gods to infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite matter, and our stronger nothing, which is every stronger motion, is god to every weaker nothing, which is every weaker motion; for if motion depend upon nothing, every particular motion is absolute; but the old opinions of atoms seems not so clear to my reason, as my own, and absolutly new opinions, which I hear call my Philosophical opinions, which opinions seem to me to be most probable, and these opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions are like Chymistrie, that from a grosse substance, extract the substance and essence, and spirits of life, or knowledge which I call the innated matter.</p>

            <p>But I desire my noble Readers to hear me with so much patience, or be so just to me as to observe, that though my text is common, for who hath not heard of the first matter? and my application old, for what is older then eternity?</p>
            <p>Yet that my arguments, and proofs are new; for what ancient Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers have preached after my way? wherefore most industrious and ingenious students, cast me not out of your Schools, nor condemn my opinions, out of a dispisement of my sex; for though nature hath made the active strength of the effeminat sex weaker then the mascu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, yet perchance she may elevate some fancies, and create some opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as sublime, and probable in effeminate brains as in masculine.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it were unjust to condemn the probable particulars for the errours of the generality; and if you speak or think me too vainglorious in pleading in my own cause, it may be thought you are irregular, and if I should not plead for my self in a just cause, it may be thought I were not a right begotten daughter of nature, but a monster produced by her escapes, or defects; for every true childe of nature will require its just inheritance.</p>
            <p>The first cause is matter.</p>
            <p>The second is Motion.</p>

            <p>Nature is matter, form, and motion, all these being as it were but one thing; matter is the body of nature, form is the shape of nature and motion.</p>
            <p>The spirits of nature, which is the life of nature, and the several motions are the several actions of nature.</p>

                     <hi>Attractive</hi> is that which we call <hi>Growth,</hi> or <hi>youth. Retentive,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">That it begins to move, and Motion is Life.</note> is that we call <hi>strength.

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Attractive spirits</hi> gather, and draw the materials to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Digestive spirits</hi> do cut and carve out every thing.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Retentive</hi> do fit, and lay them in their proper places.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Expulsive</hi> do pul down, and scatter them about.</p>
                  <p>Those <hi>spirits</hi> most commonly move according to the matter they work on. For in spung and porous light matter, their <hi>motion</hi> is quick; in solid, and weighty, their <hi>motion</hi> is slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. For the solid parts are not onely dull, and immoveable of themselves, but they hinder and <note n="*" place="margin">I mean when I say Obstruct, that it either turns their motion another way or makes them move slower.</note> obstruct those Spirits of sence, and though they cut and pierce through all, yet it is with more labour, and slower motion; for their motions change according to the quantity and quality of that matter they meet with; for that which is porous and spungy, the Figures that they form that <hi>matter</hi> in, are sooner made, and sudenlier destroyed, then that which is more combustible. This is the reason, Minerals last longer then <hi>Vegetables,</hi>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:48875:19"/>
and <hi>Animals,</hi> because that matter is both tougher and harder to work on, then <hi>Vegetables</hi> and <hi>Animals</hi> are.</p>
                  <p>These <hi>Sensitive</hi> spirits we may similize to several workmen, being alwayes busily imployed, removing, lifting, carrying, driving, drawing, digging, and the like. And although these spirits are of substance thinner then dull matter, yet they are stronger by reason of their subtility, and motion, which moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on gives them power: for they are of an acute quality, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Vitriol,</hi> as it were, of <hi>Nature,</hi> cut and divide all that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth their way.</p>
                  <p>Now these <hi>spirts,</hi> though they be <hi>infinite,</hi> yet we cannot think them so grosse an infinite, as combustible matter, yet those thinner <hi>infinites</hi> may cut, and carve the thicker infinites all into several <hi>figures:</hi> like as <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> will eat into the hardest iron, and divide it into small parts.</p>
                  <p>As I have said before, the <hi>spirits of life</hi> works according as the <hi>matter</hi> is, for every thing is shap'd according to the soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the <hi>matter;</hi> like as a man which builds a house of such wood, which is tough, and strong, because he knows otherwise it will break, by reason of the great weight they are to bear, but to make laths, he takes his wood and cuts it thin, that the nails may the easier passe through, so joyning and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting several sorts to proper uses to build his house. Or like a <hi>Cook,</hi> when he's to raise a pie, must take stiff Dough; for otherwise it will not onely fall before it be finished, but it cannot be raised, and to make the lids to cover his pye, he must use a softer Paste, otherwise it will not rowl thin; thus a stiff paste is not fit for a lid, nor a thinner paste for to raise a Pye; it may make a Cake, or so. So the <hi>spirits</hi> of <hi>life</hi> must make <hi>figures,</hi> as the <hi>matter</hi> is fit: and proper therto, for the <hi>figure</hi> of man or the like; the <hi>spirits</hi> of life take the solid and hard <hi>matter</hi> for the<note n="*" place="margin">I do not say that bones are the solid'st matter in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> 
                     <hi>Bones:</hi> the Glutinous <hi>matter</hi> for the Sinews, Nerves, Muscles, and the like; and the <hi>Oyly matter,</hi> for Flesh, Fat, Marrow. So the <hi>fluid</hi> for Blood, and such like <hi>matter.</hi> and the spirits themselves do give this dull matter, <hi>motion,</hi> not onely in the building of the <hi>figure,</hi> but to make the <hi>figure</hi> move when it is built.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>spirits</hi> of <hi>life,</hi> or <hi>lively spirits</hi> do not onely move dull and immoving <hi>matter,</hi> but makes that <hi>matter</hi> to move and work upon others; for some kinde of <hi>figures</hi> shall make<note n="*" place="margin">As the figure of man.</note> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to resemble it self, though not just be as it self is made, but as the shadow like the substance; for it works as a <hi>hand</hi> that is guided by another, and not of its own strength: that is the reason, <hi>Arts</hi> have not so much perfection as <hi>nature.</hi> The <hi>Copy</hi> is not so lively as the <hi>Original;</hi> for the spirits of life move, and work of their own strength, and the dul <hi>matter</hi> by the strength of the <hi>spirits.</hi>

                  <p>THus <hi>Spirits</hi> of <hi>sense</hi> work according to the substance of the <hi>matter:</hi> for if the <hi>matter</hi> be porous and light, they form those <hi>figures</hi> quicker, and dissolve them suddenly: But if their <hi>matter</hi> be solid and hard, they work slower, which makes some <hi>figures</hi> longer ere they come to <hi>perfection,</hi> and not so easily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. And if their strength be too weak for the <hi>matter</hi> they work upon, as wanting help, then the <hi>figure</hi> is imperfect, and mishapen, as we say. This is the reason <hi>Animals</hi> and <hi>Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi> which are yong, have not so great strength as when they are full grown; because there are fewer <hi>spirits,</hi> and the <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials</hi> are loose and unsetled, not knockt close: But by degrees more <hi>spirits</hi> gather together, which help to forward their work, bring in <hi>materials</hi> by <hi>food,</hi> setling them by <hi>nourishment,</hi> carrying out by <hi>Evacuations</hi> that <hi>matter</hi> that is unuseful, and that Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish and Chips, as I may say, which would hinder their <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> If they bring in unuseful <hi>matter,</hi> their <hi>figure</hi> increases not, as we say, thrives not. And if they carry out the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal <hi>materials,</hi> the <hi>figure</hi> decayes, and falls down. But those parts of <hi>matter</hi> which are not <hi>spirits,</hi> do not carry that part of <hi>matter</hi> which is <hi>spirit,</hi> but these <hi>spirits</hi> carry the dull <hi>matter.</hi> Thus the <hi>spirits,</hi> the <hi>innated matter,</hi> move in dull <hi>matter,</hi> and dull <hi>matter</hi> moveth by the <hi>spirits;</hi> and if the <hi>matter</hi> be fine, and not gross, which they build withal, and their <hi>motion</hi> be regular, then the <hi>figure</hi> is beautiful and well proportioned.</p>

                  <p>THe reason that the <hi>corruption</hi> of one <hi>figure</hi> is the cause of making of <hi>another</hi> of the same <hi>kinde,</hi> is, not onely, that it is of such a <hi>tempered matter</hi> that can onely make such a kinde of <hi>figure;</hi> but that the <hi>spirits</hi> make <hi>figures</hi> according to their strength: So that the <hi>spirits</hi> that are in the <hi>Seed,</hi> when they have<note place="margin">I <hi>mean the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of dull matter.</hi>

And the reason, that from one <hi>Seed,</hi> less, or more Numbers are increased and rais'd, is, that though <hi>few</hi> begin the work, <hi>more</hi> will come to their help; and as their <hi>numbers</hi> are increased, their <hi>figures</hi> are more, or less, weaker, or stronger.</p>

Understanding</hi> is, when they dance perfectly (as I may say) not to misse the least part of those <hi>figures</hi> that are brought through the senses. <hi>Will</hi> is to choose a dance, that is to move as they please, and not as they are perswaded by the <hi>sensitive spirits.</hi> But when their <hi>motion</hi> and <hi>measures</hi> be not regular, or their <hi>quantity</hi> or <hi>numbers</hi> sufficient to make the <hi>figures</hi> perfect, then is the minde weak and infirme, (as I may say) they dance out of time and measure.

                  <p>But somtimes their motions may be <hi>regular;</hi> but society is so small, so as they cannot change into so many several <hi>figures:</hi> then we say he hath a weak minde, or a poor <hi>soul.</hi> But be their quantity or numbers few or great, yet if they move confusedly, and out of order, we say the <hi>minde</hi> is distracted. And the reason the <hi>minde,</hi> or <hi>soul</hi> is improveable, or decayable, is, that the quantity or numbers are increaseable, or decrease<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and their <hi>motions</hi> regular, and irregular,</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Feaver</hi> in the Body is the same <hi>motion</hi> among the <hi>sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive spirits,</hi> as madnesse is in the minde amongst the rational <hi>Spirits.</hi> So likewise pain in the Body is like those <hi>motions,</hi> that make grief in the <hi>minde.</hi> So pleasure in the body is the like <hi>motions,</hi> as make delight, and joy in the <hi>minde,</hi> all Convulsive <hi>motions</hi> in the Body, are like the <hi>motions</hi> that cause Fear in the minde. All Expulsive motions amongst the rational <hi>spirits,</hi> are a dispersing their society; As Expulsity in the Body, is the dispersing of dull <hi>matter</hi> by the sensitive spirits.</p>
                  <p>All <hi>Drugs</hi> have an <hi>Opposite motion</hi> to the matter they work on, working by an <hi>expulsive motion;</hi> and if they move strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, having great quantity of spirits together in a little dull matter, they do not onely cast out superfluous <hi>matter,</hi> but pull down the very materials of a <hi>figure.</hi> But all <hi>Cordials</hi> have a <hi>Sympathetical motion</hi> to the <hi>matter</hi> they meet, giving strength by their help to those <hi>spirits</hi> they finde tired: (as one may say) that it is to be over-power'd by <hi>opposite motions</hi> in <hi>dull Matter.</hi>

So when there is the like quantity laid in the same <hi>Symmetry,</hi> then the <hi>figures</hi> agree in the same proportions, and Lineaments of <hi>Figures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reason, that the <hi>rational spirits</hi> in one <hi>Figure,</hi> are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the outward form of another <hi>Figure,</hi> is, that the <hi>motions</hi> of those <hi>sensitive Spirits,</hi> which move in that <hi>figure,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the <hi>motion</hi> of the <hi>rational spirits</hi> in the other. This is love of beauty; And when the <hi>sensitive motions</hi> alter in the <hi>figure</hi> of the <hi>body,</hi> and the <hi>beauty</hi> decayes, then the motion of <hi>rational spirits</hi> alter, and the <hi>love</hi> of <hi>godlinesse</hi> ceases. If the <hi>motion</hi> of the <hi>rational spirits</hi> are crosse to the motion of the <hi>sensitive spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> in opposite <hi>figures,</hi> then it is <hi>dislike.</hi> So if the <hi>motion</hi> be just crosse and contrary, of the <hi>rational spirits</hi> in <hi>opposite figures,</hi> it is <hi>hate;</hi> but if they agree, it is <hi>love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But these <hi>Sympathies,</hi> which are made only by a likenesse of <hi>motions</hi> without an intermixture, last not long; because those <hi>spirits</hi> are at a distance, changing their <hi>motion</hi> without the knowledge, or consent of either side. But the way that the <hi>rational spirits</hi> intermix, is, through the Organs of the body, especially the <hi>eyes,</hi> and <hi>Eares,</hi> which are the common doors, which let the spirits out, and in. For the vocal, and verbal <hi>motion</hi> from the mouth, carry the <hi>spirits</hi> through the <hi>eares</hi> down to Heart, where <hi>love</hi> and <hi>hate</hi> is lodged. And the <hi>spirits</hi> from the <hi>eyes</hi> issue out in Beams, and Raies; as from the <hi>Sun,</hi> which heat, or scorch<note n="*" place="margin">Scorching is, when the Motioh is too quick.</note> the <hi>heart,</hi> which either raise a fruitful crop of <hi>love,</hi> making the ground fertile, or dries it so much, as makes it insipid, that nothing of good will grow there, unlesse stinking weeds of <hi>Hate:</hi> But if the ground be fertile, although every Crop is not so rich, as some, yet it never grows barren, unlesse they take out the strength with too much kindnesse; As the old proverb, they kill with too much kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; which murther is seldom committed.

                  <p>ONE may think, and yet not of any particular thing; that is, one may have sense, and not thoughts: For thoughts are when the minde takes a particular notice of some out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Object,</hi> or inward <hi>Idea;</hi> But <hi>Thinking</hi> is onely a <hi>sense</hi> without any particular notice. As for example; Those that are in a great fear, and are amazed, the <hi>minde</hi> is in confus'd sense, without any particular <hi>thoughts:</hi> but when the minde is out of that amaze, it fixes it self on <hi>Particulars,</hi> and then have <hi>thoughts</hi> of <hi>past danger;</hi> but the <hi>minde</hi> can have no particular <hi>thought</hi> of the <hi>Amaze;</hi> for the <hi>minde</hi> cannot call to minde that which was not.</p>

Like as a point, that writes upon a Table-book, which when the Letter that was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> thereon, is rub'd out, the Table is as plain, as if there were never any let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thereon; but though the letters are out, yet the Table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book, and in Pen remain. So although this <hi>Motion</hi> is gone, the <hi>spirit,</hi> and <hi>matter</hi> remain; But if those <hi>spirits</hi> make other kindes of motions, like other kinds of <hi>Letters,</hi> or <hi>Language,</hi> those <hi>Motions</hi> understand not the first, nor the first understands not them, being as several <hi>Languages.</hi> Even so it may be in a sound; for that kinde of <hi>knowledge</hi> the <hi>Figure</hi> had in the <hi>sound,</hi> which is an alteration of the <hi>motion</hi> of the <hi>rational spirits,</hi> caus'd by an alteration of the <hi>motion</hi> of the sensitive <hi>spirits</hi> in dull <hi>matter:</hi> And by these disorderly <hi>motions,</hi> other <hi>motions</hi> are rub'd out of the Table-book, which is the <hi>matter</hi> that was moved. But if the same kinde of letters be writ in the same place again; that is, when the spirits move in the same <hi>motion,</hi> then the same <hi>knowledg</hi> is in that figure, as it was before; the other kinde of <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> which was made by other kinde of <hi>motion,</hi> is rub'd out, which several knowledge is no more known to each other, then several <hi>Languages</hi> by unlearned men.

The next, the figure being weak, their motions cannot be strong; besides, before the figure is inlarged by growth, they want room to move in. This is the reason, that new-born Animals seem to have no knowledge, especially Man; because the <hi>spirits</hi> do neither move so strong, nor have such variety of change, for want of company to make a consort. Yet some animals have more knowledge then others, by reason of their strength, as all beasts know their dams, and run to their Dugs, and know how to suck as soon as they are born; and birds and children, and the like weak Creatures, such do not.</p>

                  <p>Some will say, what <hi>sense</hi> hath man, or any other <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> when they are dead? it may be answered, that the <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnre,</hi> which is a <hi>body,</hi> may have <hi>sense,</hi> but not the <hi>Animal;</hi> for that we call <hi>Animal,</hi> is such a temper'd <hi>matter,</hi> joyn'd in such a <hi>figure,</hi> moving with such kinde of <hi>motions;</hi> but when those <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> do generally alter, that are proper to an <hi>Animal,</hi> although the <hi>matter,</hi> and Figure remain, yet it is no longer an <hi>Animal,</hi> because those motions that help it to make an <hi>Animal</hi> are ceas'd So as the Animal can have no more knowledge of what kind of sense the Figure hath (because it is no more an <hi>Animal</hi>) then an Animal, what sense dust hath. And that there is the reason, that when any part is dead in an Animal, if that those motions that belonged to the Animal, are ceas'd in that part, which alter it from being a part of the Animal, and knowes no more what sense it hath, then if a living man should carry a dead man upon his shoulders, what sense the dead man feels, whether any, or no.</p>

By this I think it probable that Internal motions, are after the manner of External motions; for we may guess at the cause by the effects, so by the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of Snow, Frost, Hail, Rain, Vapor, and the like, we may guesse at other Internal, or external motions, that produced their External figures, or alterations, and by the effects of light, darknesse, heat, cold, moisture, what manner of motions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them; wherefore I know no reason why any should condemn my opinions. But the custom of their breeding in the Schools of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and

                  <hi>Socrates,</hi> and the rest of ancient Authors, or else they consider not my opinions enough; for if they did, they might see as much probability for mine, as any of their opinions; For though in natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy there may be many touches found out by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences, and experiments, yet the Study is onely conjecturally, and built upon probabilities, and until probabilities be condemned by absolute and known truth, let them have a place amongst the rest of probabilities, and be not so partial to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict, as to be unjust to me, take not away the right of my place because young; for though age ought to have respect, yet not so as to do youth wrong, but I hope my new born opinions will be nourished in Noble and learned Schools, and bred up with industrious Students; but howsoever, I delight my self, for next to the finding out of truthes, the greatest pleasure in Study, is, to finde out proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities.

                  <p>AS I said before in my first part of my Book, that there is no first Matter, nor no first Motion, because Eternal, and Infinite, yet there could be no Motion, without matter; for Matter is the cause, Motion but the effect of Matter, for there could be no motion unlesse there were Matter to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; But there might be Matter, and Figure, without Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as an infinite, and eternal dull lump; For I see no reason, but infinite might be without running forward, or circle-wayes, if there were not several degrees of the onely Matter, wherein Motion is an Infinite Eternal effect of such a degree. Neither is it nonsense to say, Figure is the effect of Matter; for though there is no Matter without Figure, yet there could be no figure without Matter, wherefore Matter is the prime cause of Figure, yet there could be no figure without matter, wherefore matter is the prime cause of figure, but not figure of matter, for figure doth not make matter, but matter figure, no more then the creature can make the Creator; but a creature may make a figure. Thus although there is no first matter, yet matter is the first cause of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and figure, and all effects.</p>
                  <p>Although they are as infinite and Eternal, as matter it self, and when I say Matter <hi>prime,</hi> I speak for distinction sake, which is the onely Matter?</p>
                  <p>The innated Matter, is the soul of Nature.</p>
                  <p>The dull part of Matter, the Body.</p>
                  <p>And the infinite figures, are the infinite form of Nature.</p>
                  <p>And the several motions are the several actions of nature.</p>

                  <p>AS I have said before the effects are infinite, and eternal as the Causes, because all effects lie in matter and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, indeed in matter onely; for motion is but the effect of matter.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore all particular figures although dssiolvable yet is inherent in the matter, and motion, as for example, if a man can draw the picture of a man, or any thing else, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he never draws it, yet the Art is inherent in the man, and the picture in the Art as long as the man lives, so as long as there is matter, and motion, which was from all Eternity, and shall be eternally; the effect will be so.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>SOme have opinion that Motion is nothing, but to my reason it is a thing; for if matter, is a substance, a substance is a thing, and the motion, and matter being unseparablely, united, makes it but one thing.</p>
                  <p>For as there could be no motion without such a degree, or extract of matter so there could be no such degree or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract<note place="margin">I say extract. because it is the essence of matter.</note> of matter without motion, thus motion is a thing. But by reason particular motions leave moving in such matters and figures, shall we say they are deceased, dead, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come nothing; but say some, motions are accidents, and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents are nothing; but I say, all accidents live in substance, as all effects in the causes, say some, when a man for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample shakes his hand, and when he leaves shaking, whether is that motion gone (say others) no where, for that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular motion ceaseth to be, say they.</p>
                  <p>I answer, that my reason tells me, it is neither fled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, nor ceased to be, for it remains in the hand, and in that matter that created the hand, that is in that, and the like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated matter, that is in the hand. But some will say, the hand never moves so again, but I say the motion is never the lesse there, they may as well say, when they have seen a Chest full of Gold, or the like, and when their eyes are shut, or that they never see it more, that the Gold doth not lie in the Chest, although the Gold may lie there eternally, or if they should see it again, say it is not the same Gold. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise particular motions are, but shewed, not lost, or Annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: or say one should handle a vessel often, that every time you handle the vessel, it is not the same touch, vessel, or hand, and if you never touch the vessel again, that the hand, vessel, or touch is annihilated.</p>
                  <p>But particular motion, as the vessels, or hand is but used, not annihilated, for particular motions can be no more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated, then particular figures that are dissolved and how, in reason can we say in reason particular figures are Annihilated, when every part and parcel, grain, and atome, remains in infinite matter, but some will say, when a house: for example, is pull'd down, by taking asunder the materials, that very figure of that house is annihilated; but my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, that it is not, for that very figure of that house remains in those materials, and shal do eternally although those materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als were dissolved into Atoms, and every Ato me in a several place, part, or figure &amp; though infinite figures should be made by those materials by several dissolutions and Creations, yet those infinites would remain in those particular materials eternally, and was there from all eternity; And if any of those figures
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48875:31"/>
be rebuilt, or Created again, it is the same figure it was.</p>
                  <p>So likewise the motion of the hand which I said for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if the same hand moves after the same manner, it is the same motion that moved the hand before; so it may make infinite repetitions; thus one and the same motion may move eternally, and rest from moving, and yet have a being.</p>

                  <p>FOr there are millions of several motions go to the making of one figure, or in mixing, as I may say, of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral degrees of the dull part of matter, as I will give one for example in grosse external motions, where I will describe it by digestive motions, which is to fit parts, and to distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute parts to several places proper to the work. For digestive motions, there are many several sorts, or kinds of motions mixt together, as for example, a piece of meat is to be boyled, or the like, some motions cut fuel, and others take it up, others carrie, other lay down in a Chimnie, or the like place, others put fire, others kindle it, and make it burn, others take met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and melt it, others cast such a figure as a pot, others bring the pot, others set it over the fire, others take up water, others carry that water to the pot, others put that water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the pot, others kill a sheep, others divide it into parts,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48875:31"/>
others put it a part into the pot. Thus a piece of meat can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be boyled without all these motions, and many more, which would be too tedious to relate, for I could have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged in three times as many more, only to boyl a piece of meat, and if there be so many several motions in our grosse sense in such things as these, then what is there in infinite Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet for all these infinite varieties of motions, as I said before, I cannot perceive but six ground-motions, or funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental motions, from whence all changes come, which are these attractive motions, contracting motions, retentive moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, dilative motions digestive motions, and expulsive motions; likewise, although there be infinite kindes, and different fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, yet the ground-work, from whence ariseth all the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, is but from four figures; as Circular, Triangular, Cupe, and Paralels. And as there are infinite changes of motions, amongst the sensitive innated matter, working on the dull parts of matter, so there are infinite changes of motions in the rational innated matter, making infinite kinds of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and degrees of knowledge, and understanding, and as there are infinite changes of motion, so there are infinite effects, and every produced effect, is a producing effect, and effects which effect produce effects, and the onely matter is the cause of all effects, for the several degrees of onely matter, is the effect of onely matter, and motion is the effect of some sorts of the degrees of onely matter, and varieties are the the effects of matter and motion, and life is the effect of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate matter; and knowledge the effect of life.</p>

                  <p>AS I have said, there are infinite Contractions, Atractions, Retentions, Dilations, digestions, and expulsions, and to explain my self to my readers as well as I can, unlesse they should mistake me, I will here describe, although after a grosse way; yet according to my capacity. A few of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite variety of motions, first there are five, or six principal motions, from whence infinite changes are made, or produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as from Contractions, Attractions, Retentions; these three principal motions do in some kinde simpathize to each other; and dilations, and expulsions do also sympathize to each other, but digestions is a mixt motion taking part of all, but I divide them into six parts, for distinction; Now to treat of them se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally, we must make an imaginary Circumference, and Center.</p>
                  <p>Then first for Attracting motions, which is to draw towards the Center, that is, to draw to a lesse compasse, as to draw to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a point, yet Atractions draw not alwayes after one and the same manner, for some motions draw after them, as horses do Coaches, Carts, sleds and the like, but after se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral<note place="margin">This for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</note>

fashions, forms, and biasses and several motions, in those motions some slow, some quick, some crosse, some even. Again, some times Attractive motions draw, as if one should pull in a line, or draw in a net, some slope-wayes, some straight wayes; some square wayes, some round wayes; and millions of the like varieties, in this sort of motion, yet all Attracting motion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Contracting motions which move after another manner; for though both these sorts of motions, are to bring to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a point, yet Contraction me thinks, strives more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Vacuum,</hi> then Attraction, gathering all into a firm body, stopping up all porous passages, shutting out space, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering in matter, as close as it can; indeed Attractions are but in the way to Contractions, as Dilations to expulsions; but this sort of motions is, surfling, pleating, folding, binding, knitting, twisting, griping, pressing, tying, and many the like, and after several manners, or fashions.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Retention is to hold, or to stay from wandring, to fix, as I may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Fourthly, Dilations are to inlarge, as to spend, or extend, striving for space, or compasse; it is an incroaching motion, which will extend its bounds as far as it can, this sort of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is melting, flowing, streaming, spreading, smoothing, stretching, and millions of the like.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, Expulsive, is a motion that shuns all unity, it strives against solidity, and uniformity, it disperses every thing it hath power on; this sort of motion, is, breaking, dissolving, throwing about.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Digestive motions, are the creating motions, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about parts to parts, and fitting, and matching, and joyning parts together, mixing and tempering the matter for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per uses.</p>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48875:33"/>
being such a difference betwixt them, some from the nature of the figures, others from the shape of the figures.</p>
                  <p>And Minerals are produced by the Conjunction of such Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which were begot by such motions, as make heat, and drought, and cold and dry. Thus all figures are created from dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent motions, and different degrees, of infinite onely matter; for onely matter joyns, and divides it self by self motions, and hath done so, and will do so, or must do so eternally, being its nature, yet the divisions, and substractions, joynings, and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are not alike, nor do they continue, or dissolve, with the like measure of time, which time is onely as in a reference to several motions.</p>
                  <p>But as I have said, there can be nothing lost in nature, Although there be infinite changes, and their changes never repeated. For say a man dies, and his figure dissolves into dust, as smal as Atoms, and is disperst so, as never to meet, and every Atome goeth to the making of several figures, and so changes infinitely, from figure, to figure, yet the figures of all these changes lie in those parts, and those parts in onely matter; so likewise several motions may cease as figures dissolve, but still those motions lies in innated matter, and each particular figure, in the generality of matter and motion, which is on the dull part, and innated part of one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matter.</p>

First, man thinks himself to have the Supreme knowledge, but he can but think
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48875:35"/>
so, for he doth not absolutely know it, for thought is not an absolute knowledge but a suppositive knowledge, for there are as many several degrees of knowledge, as of innate matter which is infinite, and therefore not absolute, and as much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of knowledge, as there is of motions, and though all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated matter is knowing, yet all innated matter is not known; this makes figures to have of each others a suppositive, but not an absolute knowledge; thus infinite makes innated matter in some kinde, a stranger to it self, yet being know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, although not known, it makes an acquaintance with parts of it self, and being various by interchanging motions, it also loseth acquaintance; the acquaintance we call learning, invention, experience, or memory, the unknown, or not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted we call stupidity, ignorance, forgetfulnesse, illiterate, but by the acquaintance of experience, we come to finde the use of many things, and by the use we come to learn, and from our learning we come to practise, and by our practise we come to produce many effects, from the hidden and mystical causes, which are the effects, from the onely cause which is the onely matter, thus we come to finde the use of Earth, Water, Air, and Fire, Vegetables, Minerals, and so A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal with Animal, and we do not onely get new acquaintance; which is new experience, but we make use of our acquaintance to our own benefit, or at least we strive to do so; for it is the nature of life, which life is innated matter, to strive for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminency,<note place="margin">Life is in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing.</note> and absolute power, that is, onely matter would rule it self, but being infinite it neither absolutely knows it self, nor can absolutely rule or govern it self, and though it be an endlesse work, yet motion which is the moving part of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, cannot desist, because it is infinite, and eternal, thus mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving matter running perpetually towards absolute power, makes a perpetual war; for infinite, and onely matter is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes<note place="margin">It is but one thing, but three words.</note> at strife for absolute power, for matter would have power over infinite, and infinite would have over matter, and eternity would have power over both.</p>

For as I said before, there is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different knowledge belonging to every kinde, as to Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal kinde, Vegetable kinde, Mineral kinde; and infinite more which we are not capable to know, but two particular sorts in every kinde; as for example, Man may have a different knowledge from beasts, birds, fish, worms, and the like, and yet be no wiser, or knowing then they; For different wayes in knowledge makes not knowledge more or lesse, no more then different paths inlarge one compasse of ground; nor no more then several words for one and the same thing, for the thing is the same, onely the words differ; so if a man hath different knowledge from a fish, yet the fish may be as knowing as man, but man hath not a fishes knowledge, nor a fish a mans knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Likewise some creatures may have more, and some lesse knowledge then others; yet none can be said to have most, or least; for there is no such thing as most or least in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor doth the weaknesse, or imperfection in particular creatures impaire the knowledge of the kinde, or impair the<note place="margin">That is to weaken the degree.</note> knowledge as I may say, belonging to any particular sort, nor can any one have such a supremacy of knowledge as to add to the knowledge of the kinde, or sort of kinde, as to have such a knowledge as is above the capacity of that kinde, or sort to understand. As for example, a man to know more then the nature of man is to know; for what knowledge man hath had, or can have, is in the capacity of the kinde, though not to every particular man, for though nature may work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in her self; yet she cannot work beyond her self, and if there be mixe sorts of creatures, as partly man, and partly beast, partly man, and partly fish, or partly beast, and partly fish,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48875:36"/>
and partly fish, and partly foul; yet although they are mixt creatures, and may have mixt knowledges, yet they are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular sorts, and different knowledges, belonging to those sorts, and though different sorts have different knowledges, yet the kinde may be of one and the same degree; that is, every several sort of creatures, in one and the same kinde, is as knowing and as wise, as another, and that which makes some creatures seem lesse perfect then others, or more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then others, is the advantage, or disadvantage of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, which gives one creature power over another; but different Knowledg in different creatures takes advantages by turns according as it turns to it. And as there is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Knowledge, and different Kinds, and several sorts, so there is different Knowledge in different senses, in one and the same creature; for what man hath seen the interior biting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gold, and burning motions of heat? yet feels them we may imagine by the touch, the interior nature of fire to be composed of sharp points, yet our sight hath no Knowledge thereof, so our sight hath the Knowledge of light; but the rest of our senses are utterly ignorant thereof; our ears have the Knowledge of sound, but our eyes are ignorant of the Knowledge thereof; thus, though our ears may be as Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as our eyes, and our eyes as Knowing as our ears, yet they may be ignorant of each other, I say Knowledge, for sense is Knowledg, as well as reason, onely reason is a degree above sense, or sense, a degree beneath reason.</p>

                  <p>MOst figures are lined, and enterlined, as I may say, for expression sake, some figures are like a set, or nest of boxes, as for example, half a dozen boxes one within a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, so every of those figures hath the same figure, within one another, the outermost figure being the largest, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most figure the least; as for example, a man builds a house, first he builds the figure of that house with wood, as beams, and rafters and lathes; next he laies morter, then is the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of that house in morter, then he laies bricks or stones, then there is the figure of the house in stone, and brick, then it is plaistered within the inside, then there is the figure of the house in plaister, if it be painted, then there is figure of the house in painting; so likewise an Animal, as a man, first there is the figure of a man in bones, as we may see in a Anatomie, then there is the figure of a man in flesh; thirdly there is the figure of a man in the skin, then there are many, different figures, belonging to one and the same figure, as every several part of an Animal is of a different figure, and every part hath different figures belonging thereunto; as man for example, to the hand there is the palm, the back, the fingers, the nailes, yet all makes but one hand.</p>
                  <p>So the head, there is the brain, the pia mater, the dura mater, the scul, the nose, the eyes, the fore-head, the ears, the mouth, the lips, the tongue, the chin, yet all this is but a head; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the head, the neck, the brest, the arms, the hands, the back, the hips, the bowels, the thighes, the legs, the feet; besides, the bones, the nerves, the muscles, the veins, the arteries, the heart, the liver, the lights, the midrif, the bladder, the kidnies,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48875:37"/>
the guts, the stomacke, the brain, the marrow, the blood, the flesh, the skin, yet all these different figurative parts make but the figure of one man. So for Vegetables, the root, the sap, the peath, the bole, the bark, the branches, make but the figure of one tree; likewise every figure is different, this man is not like that man, this tree is not like that tree, for some trees are larger, or lesser, higher, or lower, more or lesse branched, crooked, or straghter, so in Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, some are of one shape, some of another, as men, some are slender and tall; some little and low; some big and tall, others thick and low; some high-nos'd; some flat-nos'd; some thick, some thin lipt; some high fore-heads, some low, some broad, some narrow, and numbers of like examples may be given, not onely to man, but all other Animal creatures ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their shapes, that every particular in one and the same kinde, hath different figures, yet every particular kinde hath but one and the same motion, which properly and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally belong to that Kinde of figure, as a horse to gallop, to amble, to trot, to runn, to leap, to kick, and the like; and man to lift, to carry to walk, to run, to pitch, to dig, to shut, to chop, to pull back, to thrust forward; likewise every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular part in one and the same Kinde, hath but one and the same kinde of motions, local or otherwise, and ever particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar bird, hath but one, and the same kinde of motion in their flights, and in their feeding;</p>
                  <p>So beasts, every particular kinde hath but one and the same manner of motion, and feeding; so likewise all mankinde hath after one and the same Kinde of motions belonging naturally to every particular part of his body, the onely difference is in the strength, or weaknesse, their restraints or facilities but not different in manner of the movings. But to return, to the figures, I say there are different figures belonging to one and the same kinde of figure, but the ground or funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental figures in every particular figure, are there. (As for example) a tree at first is the figure of wood, the second is such a sort of wood, as a Cedar, an Oak, an Elm, an Ash, and the like; also of such a nature of wood, some fitter to burn then to build, others that will grow but on such, or such soils, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to last longer, or die sooner, or bud and bear in such, and such seasons, some to bear fruit, others to bear none.</p>
                  <p>Likewise for Animals, the first figure is to be an Animal, that is, to have a local figure, the second figure is to be flesh,<note place="margin">Fish is a kind of flesh.</note> not wood. The third is to be such a kinde of flesh as mans flesh, not bears flesh, or dogs flesh, or horse flesh, or cows flesh, and more examples may be given, then I am able to repeat, or my book to infold, but Animals and Vegetables have more different figures, belonging to every particular, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure or Kinde then Minerals, especially metals, which are as it were composed of one piece.</p>

                  <p>As there are two sorts of shining figures; some that cast forth beams of light, as bright shining fire, and likewise from some sorts of stones, bones, and wood, so there are some sorts of figures that onely retain a bright shining quality in themselves, but cast forth no beams there-from; or else so weak and small, as not useful to our sight, but what is represented to us thereon, by other lights; this sort is water, metal, and vulgar stones, which perchance ayre may have such a shining body.</p>
                  <p>These shining bodies, as water, or metal, or the like, are not perceived in the dark, but when light is cast thereon, we do not onely perceive the light, but their own natural shining quality by that light.</p>
                  <p>Again, some figures have onely a glosse, which is a faint shining, like as a fained light, or an eclipsed shadow, as all the pores Vegetables, and Animals skins have; and some fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures are glossy through the thinnesse, or transparentnesse, not in the nature, for by reason the figure is thin, and transpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, the light shining, though transparent doth not onely shew the light, but the light gives those figures a glosse.</p>
                  <p>Some figures, as I have said, are as it were all of one piece, as some sorts of earth, water, vapor, and ayr, which may be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphosed, by contracting and dilation.</p>
                  <p>Others of divers pieces, and several works, as Vegetables, and Animals, wherein are joynts and knots, some parts soft, and some liquid, some firme, some hard, every part having a several figure, which varieties and contrarieties serve to the consistence, and preservation, but of one perfect figure; but Animals of all other figures have the most variety of works, and several motions.</p>

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48875:38"/>
For the innated matter moves in the dull part of matter, and on the dull part of matter, as I have described in my first part, for the innated matter takes not fresh and new (as I may say) for distinction sake, to make a figure with; but turns the dull matter into several figures, joyning each degree as the innate matter will, or as it is proper for such a kinde of figure, for some degrees of matter will not make, I do beleeve some kinde of figures, but the dull part of matter, is not mixed in the innate matter, although the innate matter is mixed in that, for the innate matter is pure in it self, without any gross mixture, for it is the infinite pure part of matter infinite, it is the spirits, or essence of nature.</p>

                  <p>As for example, the nourishing food that is received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the stomack transmigrated into Chylus, Chylus into blood, blood into flesh, flesh into fat, and some of the chylus

                  <p>Likewise metals when the interior nature is changed, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be rechanged again without a new creation; for if we can turn onemetal into another, yet it is not as the way of metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phosing, but transmigrating, otherwayes we may say, we can turn Animals and Vegetables into water, when we distil them, but the magick of Chymistry shall nor return them to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior nature, nor exterior shape.

               <head>AN EPISTLE TO THE Unbeleeving Readers IN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Any say that in natural Philosophy, nothing is to be known, not the cause of any one thing, which I cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade my selfis truth; for if we know effects, we must needs know some causes, by reason that effects are the causes of effects, and if we can knowbut one effect, it is an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to one, but we shall know how to produce more effects thereby.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the natural Philosophy is an endless study without any profitable advantage; but I may answer, that there is no Art nor Science, but is produced thereby, if they will without parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality consider from whence they are derived.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that it is impossible that any thing should be known in natural Philosophy, by reason it is obscure and hid from the knowledge of man-kinde.</p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:48875:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>I answer, that it is impossible that nature should perfectly understand, and absolutly know her self, because she is infinite, much lesse can any of her works know her.</p>
               <p>Yet it doth not follow, that nothing can be known, because all is not known.</p>
               <p>As for example, there are several parts of the world discovered, yet it is most likely not all, nor may be never shall be, yet most think that the whole world is found, because <hi>Drake,</hi> and <hi>Cavendish</hi> went in a circular line until they came to the place where they set out at first. And I am most confident that most of all thought all the world was known unto them before the <hi>West-Indies</hi> were discovered, and the man which discovered it in his brain before he had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled on the navigable sea, and offered it to King <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh, who slighted him as a foolish fellow, not beleeving his intelligence, and no questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there were many that laughed at him, as a vain fool, others pitied him, as thinking him mad, and others scorned him, as a cheating fellow, which would have couzened the King of <hi>England</hi> of a sum of money; but the Queen of <hi>Portugal</hi> being wiser then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                  </gap> rest imployed him, and adventured a great summe of money to set him forth on his way, which when the successe was according to the mans Genius brain, and had brought the Queen by the discovery, gold and silver mines for her Coine, then all other nations envied the King of <hi>Spain</hi> who was heir, and like a company of dogs which fight for a bone, went together by the ears, to be sharers with him.</p>
               <p>So the Bishop, who declared his opinion, of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipodes, was not onely cryed down, and exclaimed against by the vulgar which hates all ingenuity, but learned Scholers stood up against him, and the great and grave Magistrates condemned him as an Atheist for that opinion, and for that reason put him from his Bishoprick, and though he had favour to spare
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48875:41"/>
his life, which opinion hath since been found out by Navigators, but the ignorant &amp; unpractised brains, think all impossible that is unknown unto them.</p>
               <p>But put the case many went about to finde that which can never be found (as they said natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Philosophy is) yet they might finde in the search that they did not expect, which might prove very beneficial to them; or put the case ten thousand should go ten thousand wayes to seek for a cabinet of precious Jewels, and all should misse of it but one, shall that one be scorned and laughed at for his good fortune, or industry? this were a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice.</p>
               <p>But ignorance and envy strives to take off the glosse of truth, if they cannot wholy overthrow it; and those that write must arm themselves with negligence against censure.</p>
               <p>For my part I do, for I verily beleeve, that ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and present envie will slight my book; yet I make no question, when envy is worn out by time, but understanding will remember me in after ages, when I am changed from this life; but I had rather live in a general remembrance, then in a particular life.</p>

                  <p>Likewise all that is soft or wet is made by extenuating motions; now some may ask me, why extenuating motions<note place="margin">I mean natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> should cause figures to be soft, more then any other? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, first, that all extentions causeth porousnesse, or spungi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, by spreading or loosing parts, and all that are po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous tend to hollownesse, and all that is hollow tends to slacknesse, and all that are porous hollow, and slack tend to softnesse; for we may perceive whatsoever figure is porous, is not so firm, strong, nor hard, as those which are close compact; for that which hath no Vacuum, or Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent distance, hath not so much Liberty, as that which hath Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum;<note place="margin">As the pores of the skin.</note> for Vacuum is space and distance betwixt parts, which gives those parts liberty to move, and remove, and that which hath most liberty is most loose, and that which is most loose is least contracted, and that which is least contracted, is most pliant, and that which is most pliant is soft. But I desire my Readers would not mistake me, for as there is hard, soft, light, heavy, thick, thin, quick, slow, belonging to the nature of the onely infinite matter, so there are belonging to such shapes, or figures made by the working of the infinite moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons making infinite figures out of infinite matter; but the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is, that what is in the nature cannot be altered, but what is done by the working of motions may be undone again, for the effects may alter, but not the cause; thus motion and figure, or figure by motion may alter, but not the nature of the matter; For motion and figure are but the effects of the onely and infinite matter &amp;c.</p>

                  <head>Chap. 91. <hi>The extention and contraction of circles.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe nature of extention strives to get ground, that is, space, or compasse, and to disperse, or level parts as it were, and the nature of contraction strives to thrust out space and compasse, and to thrust up parts close together, and this is the reason that a circle may contract so many several wayes, because contraction flings out the compasse, and makes use of the line, laying the line into millions of several works.</p>
                  <p>And yet the exterior form which is the circular line, be one and the same, that is, the circular line is not divided, but when those works are undone, and the line extended to the full compasse, it receives the original form, which is a round circle; for as they were contracted without breaking the circle, so they may be extended into a circle again.</p>
                  <p>Likewise the circular forms may be wrought with mixt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as partly by contraction, and partly by extenuation, as when a round circle is wound about a staff, or pole, or the like; for though the winding about the staff be a contracting motion, or at least one way, which is when it draws inward, as towards the center, yet by winding it length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, or upward, is a kinde of an extenuation.</p>
                  <p>Likewise, a circle or smoak when it curls in rings, before the circle break, as we shall oft times see it doth contract, as folding and half curling, so it extenuates as it spreads and weares out. Likewise take a round string, that is, joyn the two ends, and put this circular string double, and then winde it serpentine wayes, and the like, and though the winding, or twisting about is contracting, yet winding or twisting one ring before another is extenuating.</p>
                  <p>Here have I set down after what manner of wayes are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, or continuated circles, and thus millions of several
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48875:44"/>
works may by circles be wrought, and several figures made thereof; Likewise for circular lines, some may be broad, some narrow, some round, some flat, some edged, some twisted, but those that are flat are most apt to be edged.</p>
                  <p>Likewise there may be circle lines with smooth lines, some pointed, some checkred, some twisted, some braided, and the like.</p>
                  <p>But although the circle compasse is perfect, yet the line is not a perfect Circular compasse, because the roughnesse makes it uneven. Thus as I have said before, milions of changes may be in circles, but perchance some will say, it is no longer a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, when it is turned square, or triangular-wayes, or the like.</p>
                  <p>I answer, it is a circle squared, but not a circle broke, for as long as the circle is whole, the interior nature is not dissolved, let the exterior figure be after what manner it will or can; for still it is a natural circle, although it be put into a Mathematical square, or the like; so those exterior figures, are but chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged shapes, not the natural form, but a natural square is to have four distinct lines, and a triangle three distinct lines, and a cupe six, as I take it, or sixteen; but it is to be observed, that all those figures that naturally are made of one piece, without distinct parts, or several tempered matter, may change, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change their shapes, and yet keep their own interiour nature intire, that is the nature proper to such a figure; but those figures that are made of many distinct parts, or several tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered matter, would make such a confusion in their transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, as would ruin the intire foundations.</p>

                  <p>But snow, hail, and frost, and ice is made by a level con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, as if a Circular line should be laid upon a flat ground, and be drawn a particular work, as for example, according
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48875:45"/>
to the number of watry circles, there is such a quantity of water, and if the quantity of water be more then the strength of the cold contraction, it is frozen more or lesse, now the several figures which cold contraction draws to make snow, hail, ice, and frost, are after this manner, as first the interior nature of the water is a round circle like a ring.</p>
                  <p>When it contracts into hail, the exterior figure contracts into a ball, or lump, as if one should winde up a double line, or thread into a bundle, or bottom.</p>
                  <p>Snow is made by contraction, as if one should draw a round line into a three square figure, as triangular way.</p>
                  <p>Ice, as if we should draw a round line into a four square fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, as after a cupe way.</p>
                  <p>Frost is made by such contracting motions, as if a round line should be drawn into a surfling, as a crackling figure.</p>
                  <p>When this congealed cold thaws, it is either by the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior strength of dilating motions, or by an exterior heat that draws these contractions out into smooth extenuating circles again.</p>
                  <p>Thus circular lines may be drawn from the round compasse, to be four square, three square, or length-wayes, as one would clap the brim of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> hat together; and millions of several works, and never divide the circular lines, but I will not say by a Mathematicall rule, though nature is beyond our learning.</p>
                  <p>And that which makes ice and hail more shining then frost, and snow, is, that the lines are evener; for all figures that are composed by the way of lines, are apt to shine, and those figures that have fewest points, or ends are smoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest.</p>
                  <p>Now some may say, or ask, why I should think snow is made triangular wayes? My reason is, because it seems rougher, and not so united as ice, or hail, which shews the interior figure hath more points, or unevener numbers, or unequal lines, and a triangular figure is not so smooth, or at least seems not so, as a circular, a paralel, or cupe; for in the angulars the points and lines are odd, and the lines run slope-wayes, whereas the figure of a cupe, although it hath more points, yet the figure is more proportionable, by the even number of the points and lines; for as there are four points, so there are four equal lines, which make an equal number, when in the figure of a triangular the points and lines are odd; for though there are a plural number, yet it is an uneven number, as being odd. And as I have said, the lines are slope when the figure of a cupe is just square, besides triangular points be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing odd, multiplie and substract by reflections, as we shall see by triangular glasses, that from one face millions are made by subdividings. Thus what is made uneven by odd numbers, are made even by equal numbers, and the odd points,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48875:45"/>
and slope lines, make the figure of snow rough, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual points, and straight lines make the figure of ice smooth, but I treat here of exterior figures, or rather countenances, not of the interior form, for their contractions change the exteriors, not the interiors.</p>

This sort of air which is made of watry circles, is like seething hot water, for it is a moist heat, and not like the natural air, for this is but a Metamorphosed air; for the interior nature of water is undissolved, onely the exterior is altered, the lines being become small and edged, by the fair extenuations, but when those circles extenuate smaller then the quantity of matter will afford to give a compasse, it breaks, and turns to hot burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire; for the extenuating motions therein ceasing not, do stretch those lines so smal, as they fall into pointed parts; this alters the interior nature from being water, to burning fire, for the interior nature of water is the circle line, but if those lines be drawn by contracting motions into bigger lines, and lesse circles, it becomes from thin hot air to vapor, or mists, and from vapor to water, and so from water to slime, from slime to mud, from mud to earth, as it did extenuate, so it contracts, if nothing hinders the same; for contraction draws
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48875:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the lines to such a bignesse, like as a smaller thred to a big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger thred, so from the thinnest air to the thickest air, from grosse air to the thin vapor, from thin vapor to thick vapor, fromthick vapor to water to slime, fromslime to mud, from mud to earth; but according as the contracting and dilating motions are quick, or slow, it is sooner or longer turning out of one shape into another, and if any of the circular lines break by other motions or figures before it coms to the furthest extention, the quantity becomes lesse wasting that matter into figures of other natures, being dissolved from that natural figure; thus that ball, or lump may be dissolved, like as Animals, or the like; For no question these balls are created and dissolved as Animal kinde, and are as numerous as other creatures, and some lasting longer then others, and some dissolving sooner; though their creations are different, one being produced by procreation, the other by extenuation: thus these elements are increaseable, and decreaseable, and other creature are; and when the interior nature is altered, it dissolves as other creatures do, onely the exterior with the interior dissolves, which most of other creatures do not, for when the interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or is altered in Animals, the exterior is perfect, and dissolves more by degrees.</p>

                  <p>OYL is partly of the nature of fire, and partly of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of water; for as it is soft, fluid, liquid, and moist, it is of the nature of water; as it is hot burning and flamable, it is of the nature of fire, for that which makes it fludi and liquid, is by extenuations, and that which makes it moist and liquid is by extenuating circles, and that which makes it burning, is, that those circular lines are composed of pointed parts, which when fire and oyl meets, the fire breaking those lines a sunder, sets those pointed parts at liberty, which causeth it to rise in a flame, and the reason why it flames, is, that it doth not suddenly lose the circular extenuating nature; for flame is somewhat of the nature of water, as being fluid, though not wet, and the reason why flame is fluid, is, because it ascends in a circular motion, for though the ascent be in a strict parrelled line, yet the matter is after a circular figure, as a hollow spungy body, as after this manner or the like, which shuts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, like an arrow out of a bow, onely imagining the arrow to be in serpentine<note n="*" place="margin">As thns</note> shape, and to turn and spin about as it as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends, likewise the body to extend, or spread outward, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the bulk or quantity, which several figures, or several motions, may be all at one time, and in one and the same thing, and work to one and the same effect, and to several ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects at the same time, which causeth it to be fluid, liquid, and light, for light as well as oyl, water, or flame, is fluid, caused

by extenuating motions, for as water will run forward when it hath liberty, or run backward in a torrent when it is stopt, so light will enter when it hath passage, or run back by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection if it be stopt, but all those fluidities are different by reason their extenuations are different; For light is caused by swift extenuating paralel lines; water, oyl, and the like by extenuating circular lines, which make it moist, and liquid, as well as fluid, but flame takes part from all, for it is light and fluid by the swift extenuating parallel lines, it ascends in, and liquid, although not wet, by the circular motions it as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends up in, and burning by the sharp parts it is composed of; vitral is after the same nature of oyl, onely the lines are<note place="margin">Or rather like flame.</note> edged, as a knife, or the like, or sharp edged tools, which make it have an exterior pressing quality, as burning fire hath; but the exterior of oylie lines are smooth, which makes it soft, and glib, and not so sharp and penetrating as vitrals, or the like are.</p>
                  <p>Thus flame, light, oyl, fire vitrals, waters, have mixt motions, to make one figure, and many figures, to make those figures which make them to be of mixt qualities producing mixt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, as indeed all effects are of a mixt nature.</p>

                  <p>ME thinks 'tis strange, that men should wonder more at the nature of the Load-stone in attracting iron, and in the norths attracting o f the needle touched with the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, then at the suns attracting of vapor.</p>
                  <p>But some will say, that it is the nature of fluiditie, of which nature vapor is one, to move with facility, and not the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<note place="margin">I mean here the exterior nature not the interior nature.</note> of solidity, of which nature iron is one, which is heavy and slow; but I say, if the attracting motion in one body be stronger then the contracting, and retentive motions in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther body, and those figures motions work with, be advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; I see no reason but a fluid body may attract a solid body; For it is not the substance of the body that works, or produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth effects, but the agility, subtility, or strength of motion, and advantage of the shape, so that the working power is more in motion and figure, then meerly the matter; as for example, doth not experience prove that fluid, vitral, will work through solid metal, the reason is, because the expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive motions in the vitral and sharp points, are stronger then the contracting motions, in the metal and blunt edges: but some will ask me, why the Load-stone attracts onely iron? such a question I ask, why beauty should forcibly attract the eye? they will answer by sympathy; and I have heard, that it was the opinion of learned men, that sympathy had the same effect, betwixt the Load-stone and iron, but I think it not so much in sympathy, as supremacy.</p>
                  <p>Besides, it is the nature of contracting motions, of which the Load-stone is strongly inhabited withal, to work on that which is without it, as from it, not within it, or as it were upon it, which no other visible kinde of motion doth.</p>
                  <p>And certainly the Load-stone is composed of sharp figures, yet not of such sorts as heats or burns, and those figures do issue out as beams do from the sun: and as they draw the iron, they back return, and as the bright beams issue from the sun, do neither weaken nor lessen it, so the visible beams that issue out of the Load-stone, neither make it lesser or weaker; yet the beams of the Load-stone, do as the sun beams, the farther they spread out, the lesse strength they have to draw; Besides, if other motions which oppose, and are stronger then the natural motions, may weaken the strength, as accidental maladies mayweaken Animals, or shrewd and froward weather vegetables, or the natural consisting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions proper to that figure, may turn to expulsive motions, and over-power the natural attracting motions, that issued there-from.</p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:48875:47"/>
                  <p>But as I have said, it seems the attractive power of the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, is stronger then the irons retentive power, and sharp fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures that issue there-from, are more advantagious then the blunt edges in the iron; and as the sharp figures in fire unknit and loosen the contractive body of metals, making them fluid, so the sharp points that issue in lines from the Load-stone fasten to iron, drawing it to it; and as fire works upon seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral bodies after a different manner of way, according to the nature of the body it works on, producing divers effects; so for all I can perceive may the Load-stone; for certainly we do not know, nor never can come to that knowledge, as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the several effects, that are produced from the least, or as we account the most inconsiderable creature made in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; so that the Load-stone may work as variously upon se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral bodies, as fire, and produce as various effects, although nor to our sense, nor after the same manner of wayes, that fire doth, and as fire works variously upon various bodies, so there are fires, as several sorts, and those several ral sorts have several effects, yet one and the same kinde, but as the causes in nature are hid from us, so are most of the effects; but to conclude my discourse, we have onely found that effect of the Load-stone, as to draw iron to it; but the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting motion is in obscurity, being invisible to the sense of man, so that his reason can onely discourse, &amp; bring probabilities, to strengthen his arguments, having no perfect knowledge in that, nor in any thing else, besides that knowledge we have of several things, comes as it were by chance, or by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for certainly all the reason man hath, would never have found out that one effect of the Load-stone, as to draw iron, had not experience or chance presented it to us, nor the effect of the needle, and all the ages before, I mean those we have Records of, were ignorant of that one effect, and perchance other ages may finde out some other effects produced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, which these ages are ignorant of; And as our knowledge comes slow, and in parts, and pieces, so we know but parts and pieces of every particular thing, neither is the generality of our senses capable of one and the same knowledge; for what one sense knowes, another sense is ignorant of, and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionlesse there are some things in nature that it is impossible for our senses to be made acquainted therewith, as being too cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious for our senses, but not to some other senses; for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>I Perceive the norths attraction of the Load-stone is not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the same manner of attraction, as the Load-stone at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts iron, for the attractions of the Load-stone draws iron to it, but the attraction of the north draws the Load-stone towards it, by the turning it that way, as the Sun will do the the heads of some sorts of flowers; For if the north attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Load-stone, as the Load-stone iron, the Load-stone would be in a perpetual motion, travelling to the north pole, unlesse it were fixt, but I do not hear that a Load-stone doth remove out of the place wherein it is, but it turns, as I may say, the face towards it; now the question will be whether the Loadstone turns it self towards the north, or the north turns by compulsion, or by sympathy, the experiment will be by iron, that if a great quantity of iron should be said at one side of the needle, whether the needle would not vary from the north towards the iron, if it do, it shews the Load-stone turns itself towards the north, or else it could not turn from the north, for certainly the north hath a greater operative power to turn the Load-stone to it, then the Load-stone could have to turn it self from it, so if a quantity of iron can cause the needle to vary, it shews that the Load-stone turns to the north by a self motion, and not the motions of the north that make it turn to it, but if it varies not towards the iron, then the north forces it, unlesse the Load-stone takes more delight to view the norths frowning face, then to imbrace hard iron, or that the feeding appetite is stronger then the viewing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; for it onely turns it self to the face of the north, but if it turns not it self, the north forces it to turn, which as I have said before, is to be found by the experiments of iron; but if it turns it self, I beleeve it may receive some refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from those raies which stream from the north, for all things turn with self-ends; for certainly every thing hath self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love, even hard stones, although they seem insensible, so the Load-stone may work as various effects upon several subjects, as fire, but by reason we have not so much experience of one as the other, the strangenesse creates a wonder, for the old saying is, that ignorance is the mother of admiration, but fire which produceth greater effects by invisible motions, yet we stand not at such amaze as at the Load-stone, because these effects are familiar unto us.</p>
                  <p>But per chance the Load-stone is nourished by iron as many crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are by heat, for though the creatures are nourished there with, yet the heat alters not its vertue, nor the body in which<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the heat inheres, loses not the property of heating, the sun is not weakned by warming the earth, though the earth is stronger by the warm 'th of the sun; but warm 'th feeds after a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual

                  <p>So the Load-stone may be refreshed, although not fed by the cold north, and as fire is fed by fuel, so is the vertual part of the Load-stone by iron, or as exercise gets health and strength to Animal bodies, so doth the Load-stone on iron, and as idlenesse breeds faintnesse, or weaknesse, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>For fire will sooner melt metal, then dissolve stone, but when the exterior form of stone is dissolved, it is changed from the nature of being stone, and be comes dust and ashes.</p>
                  <p>And though metal would likewise change the interior na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if the exterior form were dissolved, yet metal, although it be melted, keeps the interior nature, and exterior form, but not the exterior motions; for metal is metal still, although it be melted, onely it becoms fluid, this sheweth that fire doth not onely alter the exterior motion of stone, but dissolves, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior form, and so the interior nature, which in metal it doth not, unlesse a more forcible fire be applied thereto then will serve to melt; which shewes, that although the interior mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of stone be contractions, as all solid bodies are, yet the interior, nor exterior natural figure is not circular as metals are, for stone cannot be made fluid, and as it were liquid as metal will be, but crumbles into dust, and wasts, as wood or the like, and not evaporates away as water, which metal doth; This sheweth that the exterior and interior natural form of stone is composed of parts, and not in one piece, as a circle; I do not mean in one piece, as the exterior bulk, but in one piece, in the exterior, and interior nature; For though you may pound, or file metal to dust, that dust as small as Atoms, the like may be done to stone, wood, and flesh, or any thing that is dividable, yet it will keep the nature of being metal, stone, wood, flesh, or the like, although the parts be no bigger then an Atom; but if you do dissolve the exterior nature, the interior nature doth dissove also, thus the exterior form may be altered, but not dissolved, without a total dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

far, as causeth those parts to be fluid, and as it were liquid, if those things were contracted, but if they be liquid and fluid of themselves, they save those fiery motions that labour, and when this motion strives to ascend with those loose parts, the liquor riseth up in bubbles, or waves, but when those fiery motions are over-poured by the weight, they fall back again; thus the weight of the liquor, and the sharp points of the fire strive together, one party striving to ascend, the other to descend, so that those fiery motions, are to pull out, or to bear up, and the watry motion to pull, or presse down, but evaporating, is when the extenuating lines are stretcht so far out, as to break, or the lighter parts are carried away, and dispersed amongst other figures; but all rarifying heats, are caused by slow dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting motions, and not expulsions, for if such sorts of dilations as make rarifying heat, were extended beyond the line of the matter they work on, it alters the nature of the figure, and the motions of that nature; but rarifying heat is an extenuating mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, spreading parts equally, and evenly, but the farther they are spred, the more hot grows the heat, as neerer to expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and though all rarifying heat is in the way of burning, yet not in the manner.</p>

                  <p>Tis true, that there are many liquors that are subject to burn, but there are few wets that have not power to quench, for the spherical drops do either blunt the fiery points, or disperse the the united body, or intangle them in the porous circles.</p>

                  <p>THe reason why water quenches fire, is, that the figure being spherical, and porous, gives distance and space of parts, where the sharp figures of fire, flying about to bite the circular lines asunder, that they may ravel out that figure of water, lose their strength both in their ffight and compasse, breaking their forces, by dispersing their parts, and intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling their dispersed parts in the hollow places, in the watry figure, like arrows that are shot into a net, seldom break the net, but intangle themselves, by reason there is no firm substance to strick on, or in; for being soft and spungy, there is no stop, nor hold; besides water being wet and wet in the nature is sticking, that when those sharp points do at any time break the lines, they joyn again, for being fluid each part moves to each other, and being wet they joyn, and being circular they unite, into the natural figure.</p>
                  <p>Thus in a plain combat water most commonly hath the better of fire, if there be not too much odds on the fires fide for quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but when fire doth come by an undermining motion as when some other figures are betwixt them, then fire gets the better, by the help of those undermining motions.</p>

                  <p>A moist cold doth pull, or draw from the center towards the circumference.

                  <p>Also a dry, or congealed cold, and a dry heat, are not several kindes of motions, but moves after several manners; for as moist cold, and heat extends, and enlarges from the center, to the circumference, so a dry heat, or a dry, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed cold, contracts from the circumference towards the center, the congealed cold in several works; a dry cold, or a dry heat onely draws into a lesse space, or compasse, yet the same difference in the manner of the motions, is between a dry heat, and a dry cold, as was between a moist heat, and a most cold; for a dry heat drives from the circumference to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; &amp; a dry cold draws from the circumference to the center for although al drought is from the circumference to the center, and all moisture from the center to the circumference, yet the several manner of movings are infinite, also cold, and heat are not several kindes of motions, but different motions, as every man is of man-kinde, but they are different men.</p>

matter makes the serenest air, as small threads make the finest cloth; where some is like cobweb-lawn, so sheer, or clear, as the smallest objects may be seen through, which is spread about the globe of the earth, as a thin vail over a face, or body, and from the sun rising, the motions that make light run in lines upon it, and so is like a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment laid all over with silver-twist, or rather like silver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wier, from the sun rising to high noon, it is as it were, setting, sewing, or imbroidering on; this serene air at mid-day it is quite finished, and by sun set it is quite reapt off again.</p>
                  <p>And to shew that the lines of light are as it were laid upon this serene air, and not mixt into it, is by the vapor which gathers into dark clouds, which will obscure the light, as far as they spread, besides if the light were intermixt the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and matter could not so easily, nor so quickly withdraw, or intermingle, as we see they do; for what is intermixt, is hard to separate; but dark clouds are onely as spots, which by rarification are rubbed out, if they be wet spots, or drops, they fall out in shours of rain, but by such sorts of motions as by ringing, or squeesing, or griping with a hand, or the like, which breaks the sea, or waves of water, which are clouds, into several streams of drops, sometimes with a greater force, and sometimes with a lesse, according as the motions are stronger, or weaker.</p>

                  <p>And the reason I say silk, is, because darknesse is softer then light, which light I similise to silver, for the brightnesse of light many times hurts the opticks, which darknesse doth not.</p>

                  <p>THe lines of light are whole and come so from the sun until the light of such a figure, and according to the figure, there the lines are broken, and the breaking of light a ccord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the several figures, makes several colours, so it is not inherent in the thing, but in the form of the thing, which is the figure that makes several colours breaking the several lines of light several wayes, so the Diers of several colours by their observations findes it out by their practise, though they know not the reason of it, but the true reason is, that all those several dies make several figures, which several figures breake the lines of light several wayes, which being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken several wayes produce all those several co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>
                  <p>To shew you that it is several figure that breaks the lines of light that make several colours, you may see it in a pigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons neck and brest, how many various colours it will change into, with and in the same place, the lines of light being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken several wayes by the pigions feathers, that make several fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, as also you may perceive in Rain-bows, the sun shining upon a watry cloud, the cloud being between you, and the sun what various colours there are, so to spout water out of your mouth, if it be between me and the sun, it makes the same colours, and all this is nothing else, but that the lines of light are broken so many wayes, by the several forms and figures it shines of, which produceth the multiplicity of all those va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious colours.</p>
                  <p>Again, more plainly to make it appear, that there can be no more truth but this in colour, take a triangular glasse it is all of one colour, and was never sent to the diers, and look in it, and you shall see the most various colours in the world, the colours are not in the glasse, therefore with ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional man it suffers no dispute at all, that colour is nothing else, but the lines of light broken by several forms, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, that produceth all the various colours that are in the world.

                  <p>SOme say colours are made by perturbed or obstructed light, but in my opinion, colours are broken lines of light; for when light is obstructed as being stopped it reflects with double light, those lines returning back like double strings, and if it were perturbed light, like over-agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated air, or troubled and rough waters, the light would be onely thicker, and mudier, having not liberty to move in so level, even, and straight, paralel lines; it is true, those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed motions may be the cause many times of breaking the light, which broken parts contracting into several figures, or works, causeth several colours, every particular work, being a several colour, and when these several figurative works are mixt, being part of one work, and part of another, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors are also mixt.</p>
                  <p>For the several works made of the pieces of light, are that which makes several colours, and not the pieces of light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out those works, for if those pieces of light lay scattered and not contracted into several figurative workes, they could, or would not make colours, but if colours are not made by pieces of light, they are made by contracting the straight unbroken lines of light, which contraction turns light into colours, as contractions do water into snow, ice, hail, frost; Now it is to be observed, that it is not onely the contracted motions on the water that make the difference, but being contracted into such or such a figure; for whensoever water is contracted into such a manner of figure, it is snow, if into such a figure it is hail, if in such a figure it is ice, into such a figure frost, and may do so constantly, and eternally, and so when light is contracted into such a figure, it is red, when into such a figure, blue, into such a figure, yellow, into such a figure green, and when it is contracted partly into the figure of red, and partly into the figure of blue, it makes a figure of purple, and if it be contracted partly into the figure of red, and partly into the figure of blue, and partly into the figure of purple, it makes a fourth figure, which is a fourth colour, and so a fift, and so infinites, likewise one and the same figure which is one perfect colour, may vary with each patticular figure, which is each particular colour, and upon what body soever these figures are printed, they take colours, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the figures differ, the colours are changed, or alter; for it is not the body that they are printed on, or the reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of light, cast upon such bodies that make colours, but such figures made by contracted lines of light, which figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive works give such colours to any thing they can print, or place on, but the reason why I think they are rather broken pieces of light contracted, then contracted streight lines, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are so lasting, for though some colours will fade
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48875:55"/>
sooner, yet some will last a long time; for whatsoever work is wrought with parts, as I may say, several pieces of thread, is not so apt to undo or ravel out, as that which is but of one piece, unlesse the thread were circular, without ends, but lines of light are paralels, and not circles, as for shadows of colours, in my opinion they are produced after this manner as I said, the figure of blue or the like, which is one perfect colour, and the figure of red which is another perfect co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour makes a third figure, which is a mixt colour, likewise blue and yellow makes a different figure, which is a different colour from blue and red, and blue and yellow, makes a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent figure, which is a different colour from blue and green, &amp; so we may match figures until we be weary, but whatsoever hath constantly part of one and the same figure, in the several or single compartments of other figures, which are other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, as blue and green, blue and red, blue and yellow; and the like appears in shadows, by reason one particular figure, or figurative part is the ground-work, which is, the ground colour, which makes all the colours it mixes with, partly of its own complection, and according as there are more or lesse, of that figure, the shadow is fainter or stronger, and according as the contractions are more or lesse, the colours are deeper, or paler; for those figures that are closer contracted, and rougher wrought, are the darkest colours, as neerest to black, and those figures that are loosest, contracted, and finer wrought, ars the the lightest, or palest colours, as being most light, when the parts are loosest, and most at liberty, and the brightest, as the most glorious colours that are made of the purest, and clearest light, which is of the smallest lines of light, as I may say, the finest threaded light, for some lights are thicker then others, by reason their lines are grosser.</p>
                  <p>Also colours which are broken contracted lines of light, may appear darker, or brighter according to the reflection, of other lights, or rather according to the straight and unbroken lines of light are that cast upon them, likewise some light doth alter the colours that are made by other lights, as some colours appear not by candle-light as by day-light, and the reason is, that several lines of several lights, being grosser, or finer, causeth the colour to appear duller or brighter, and some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular lights make some colours appear more then others, and some particular lights obscure some particular colours more then others, according as they are further, or neerer off the nature of each other; for though the several figurative works make the several colours, yet it is the lines and pieces of light, that make those figures and works.</p>

                  <p>AS I said before, the solid bodies moving in the soft, &amp; more porous bodies, make many figures therein, some as prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, some as painted, others as sculpture, as cut, or carved in wood, or stone, or cast in metal, or moulded in earth, some are as if a man, or the like creature should print them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in snow, others as if they should make themselves in snow, as for example; as if a man should stand, and let the snow fall thick upon him until he were all covered over, there would be his figure in snow, or if he should lie down in snow, there would be his print; so it is in air, as we move from place to place, new figures are made, and the former figures moulder, or melt out, but according as the air is, so they last, or decay, for if the air be congealed with cold, thickned with grosse fogs or mist, the figures last the longer therein, although in a misshapen posture, like ruina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted buildings, or broken statues, or like defeated armies, here an arm, or a piece of an arm, or a hand, and there leggs, here a head, there a mangled body; but when the air is thin, and serene, the print dissolves assoon as the figure removes; and if the air were as solid as snow, we should see the figures as perfect in the one, as in the other; but the air being very thin, and porous, the sight of the eye runs thorow without stay, or stop, taking no notice, like water in a sieve, wherein nought can be contained, because there is no hold to keep the water in from running out.</p>

                  <p>IN some things there is such sympathy betwixt the internal form, and the external figure, as the alterations of the one, change the nature of the other; as for fire, when the external figure is altered, the internal faculty is gone, here the internal na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture depends upon the exterior figure; but as for water, the external figure may be changed, as we see when it is frozen, but the internal nature not changed, for it is as water still, though it be not fluid, here the internal depends not upon the external; but thus much the exterior figures of all things depend so so much upon the exterior form, or nature, that when the internal is changed, the exterior cannot be altered, from and to, as to change the countenance or face, as I may say by contraction, and dilation, as water, and metals, and many others, but an animal figure may remain, as it was for a time, when the internal is changed, but not long, as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, Animals, although the internal nature, and faculty be<note place="margin">As we say dead.</note> changed, which is to move after such a manner, as is proper for Animal, the external figure is not altered: for when A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals are dead, the external, which is the outward shape

remains perfect, for a time, yet the internal motions may be in disorder, as they are in animals that sound, or are sick or faint, or in vegetables that are fading, or drooping; but when the internal motions move orderly again, either of themselves, or by the help of assistant motions, and figures, the Animal is as it was before, and the Vegetable flourisheth green again, thus there may be an alteration; but when there is an absolute change in the internal, there can be no return, but by a new creation, for all alterations of motions do not do it, but a total change.</p>

                  <p>The slimie or gelly part of the earth is made by such kinde of motions as spin small lines lik Silk-worms, in a round hollow ball; water is made after that manner, onely those lines extenuate more into perfect circles.</p>

                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:48875:57"/>
as if one rid post, if it were the moon, why should it not be high water, or full tide <hi>Margell,</hi> that it is in <hi>Scotland</hi> at the time, the power of the moon being all one, so that comes very improbable to me, for many things fall out at the same time, and yet the one not cause of the other, and in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy there is nothing so ordinary, as to mistake the cause of things, since indeed the things for the most part are hid from us; some again will have the Sun the cause of the ebbing and flowing of the sea, others rationally say, heat makes motion, and the seas being salt make motion, because it is hot, but how comes it that the fresh waters ebbe and flow? even springs well, whatsoever the cause be of the seas motion where it moves,; for in some places they say it doth not, but where it moves it is never high water in one place, but it is low water in another place, and the sea moves alwayes<note place="margin">If one pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers water on the ground it flows with a Convex.</note> circularly, for as it is the nature of water to be made in fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of circular lines, so it is the nature to flow circularly, which in my opinion is the reason of the ebbing and flowing tides, that moves circularly, that is, part of a circular, where the convex flows still forward, the flowing motion extends more and more, causing it to swell out, and the concave ends to extend longer and closer, in so much as at last the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave ends are joyned into a convex, for it doth not extend in aperfect round circle, as I shall describe in my following dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, but after an oval, or rather a pear figure, but when the flowing convex is extended beyond the strength, it straight breaks, being most weak, by reason it is most extended out, so that when the tides have no more strength to flow for want of water to extend, and the convex over-powred by extenuation, it breaks asunder, and so falls back, whereby the convex parts are now become the concave, and where it was concave, is now become convex, which causeth it to flow the other way, and ebb where it did flow, for where it lies concave it ebbs, and where it is conex is flows, and thus it ebbs and flows perpetually, where it hath free passage, but the farther it flows, the weaker it becoms, by reason the strength is abated, like a horse that hath run fast and far, at last is so weak and breathlesse as he falls down, so when the convex can extend no farther, it breaks in two, but as the convex extends, the concave ends draw closer together, whereby such time as they come to joyn, the convex is so bowingly stretched, as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes brittle, as I may say or weak, which causeth it to break, but it is to be observed that the tides have a double mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for as the convex flows forward, the concave ends draw backward at one and the same time, for the extenuation of convex one way, causeth the extenuation of the concave<note place="margin">In a pear figure.</note> ends the other way; but by reason the two ends draws close towards a point, the ebbing waters seem narrow and little, but the ebbing tides are but an effect of the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48875:58"/>
flowing tides, not a cause in it self, for the interior nature of water is to flow where it can get liberty, and freedom of passage, and where it doth not flow it is obstructed by some obscure cause, but I desire my reader not to mistake me, as to conceive the motions of the tides, and the interior nature of water all one, being something alike; but the motions of the tides, and the motions of the interior nature of water are as different as the local motions of Animals, and their interior nature, and I beleeve if the fresh waters had the same liberty as the sea waters, to flow which way they would without op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, or obstructions of hils, dales, banks and walls, and had the like quantity to move withal, I beleeve they would as naturally flow as the sea, and ebbe when their strength fails, and I beleeve if there were a sufficient quantity of water in the sea, and no obstructions, as Islands, creeks, and the like to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the passage, and that the earth were like a billiard ball, it would flow perpetually round, as the Globe turns upon the Pole, if the Pole turns not round with the Globe.</p>

                  <p>And as the convex extends, the concave ends must of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty draw closer together.</p>

                  <p>SPring tides I conceive to be caused by waters that issue forth from the veins of the earth, which are apt to swell, and then to vent themselves forth at certain times, as natural issues, which flowing causeth the tides to be greater, because it hath more strength to extend farther, and the tides to be higher because the convex is thicker, and fuller, for the greater body of water, the farther it flowes; for it is for want of strength which makes an ebb, or want of passage which makes a stop, and when the tides are lower, there are some invisible obstructions, or the eatrh hath drawn or suckt from that part of the sea.</p>

                  <p>THe reason the tide flows against the stream a of River, is, that the quantity of sea water forceth through the stream, and the descent of the river forceth the stream to passe through the motion, or rather by the motion of the tide, for the natural motions of all waters being to flow, and the force of the des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent added therto, gives it a double, if not a treble strength, so that when the force of the tide, and the force of the stream meets, and incounters, they make passes, as Duellers that fight hand to hand; but if one water runs quite through another, it is most probable that the tide runs through the stream, by reason it is armed strongly with salt, which may cause it to be stream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, when the river water is porous, and weak by reason it is fresh, and thin as I may say.</p>

                  <p>THe difference of salt water and fresh, is, that salt waters circle lines are flat, and edged, as a knife, or the like, and in fresh water, round, which edge makes it not lesse smooth, although more sharp, nor hinders the extenuating compasse, but the lines being flat, make it more solid, and so give it more strength, then the fresh water circle that is round, which makes it more porous, then salt water is, by the experience of an egge, and the like, which in fresh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the egge will sink to the bottom, but very salt water will bear it up, from sinking, and according to the strength, it will bear more or lesse, but those lines may exteriorly alter, from flat to round, and round to flat, and never alter the interiour nature, as to break the compasse, which is to dissolve the circle or ring (as I may say) which circle ring is the interior figure.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>AS I have said, that sort of air which is made by watry circles is apt to sound with every motion that strikes thereon, by reason of the hollow figure being spheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.</p>
                  <p>Likewise this is the reason running brooks make a murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing noise; also this is the reason, that the tides do make such a noise in the ebbs, and flowes, circles pressing, or rather strike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each other.</p>
                  <p>Again, this is the reason the windes, when they blow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on airy, or watry circles, by striking those spherical circles, cause it to sound, and make a roaring noise, by the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion it makes therein; for winde which is an expulsive vapor doth not onely strike those watry circles, but those that are extended into air, and when those motions drive circle against
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48875:59"/>
circle, or circle upon circle, makes such quick rebound, which rebounds in contracting and crossing each other, make a confused sound, which we call tempestuous and stormy, and it is to be observed, that a tempest in the air, and a storm in the water, and thunder, is much after one and the same kinde of noise; But as thunder is caused by the expulsion of the most extended circular lines, so winde is the expulsion of the more grosser circles, as when lines break, which are extended no farther then to vapor, also these expulsions, if they be not very violent, cause rain; for the expulsed motion being no stronger then to presse upon the unbroken and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended circles, either of vapor, or air, drives it into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try compasse, but when the weather is cloudy, it is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether so hard prest upon, as to drive it into perfect water circles, but to the next degree, as a thick vapor.</p>
                  <p>And when the weather is unconstant, as we say, that is sometimes grosse and thick, and then it will be strait clear, and bright, is as the presser doth abate, or increase; but unforced raines (as I may call them) which is without a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent constraint, is when those circles are drawn into a wetry compasse in a natural order, and by the natural waight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thicker then natural air, that is original air, and not trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migrated water, it falls down on the earth.</p>
                  <p>Likewise the pouring showers make a sound, by the force of the falling drops, striking as they fall, sound; but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the water is divided, by the falling motions into lesse bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as it were, which makes not so strong a sound, having lesse compasse as the tides, or air having fewer circles in a body, as in drops, which makes it of a lesse bulk, and the lesse the body is, the weaker, and the smaller is the sound.</p>
                  <p>But when the watry lines are drawn into a triangular fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of snow, it falls silently without sound, by reason the watry line is drawn out of the extended circle. Besides, that figure is the lightest figure, by reason of the inequality, for a square hath four equal parts, which makes a just number, so an equal ballance which gives it a steddy weight, and a circle is equally round, without parts, which gives a steddy weight.</p>
                  <p>But a triangular figure is in three parts, which is no just number, nor equal ballance, nor steddy weight, which make it of lesse force, for being a wavering figure, it cannot presse hard, nor strike strongly, nor fall heavy, but flies lightly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout.</p>

                  <p>THunder and lightning are caused from watry circles, for when they are extended from water to vapor, from vapor to air, from temperate air, to hot air, from hot air to fire; for if those circles extended beyond the compasse, and strength of the line, they break, which is the cause of thunder, and lightning; for assoon as the farthest extention of the circle is broken, those extended parts do with an extraordinary swift<note place="margin">See my chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fame</note> motion run, or rather shut forth into bright flaming flashes, as spinning lines of light, but when those lines extend with a strong strength, they break into smal parts, which causeth thunder to follow lightnings; for those bteaking parts some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times expulse disorderly, beating and striking upon those circle lines that are unbroke, which circles being of a hollow figure, cause a sound in the higher region, whereto they are ascended, for their extention causeth them to be light, their lightnesse to ascend; But all hollow figures being concave within, and convex without, do present to the ear, if they be strong, as concave, and convex glasses doth objects, when pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the eye; thus hollow figures cause a hollow sound if they be struck, for the concave draws those motions in which rebounds from fide to side, and the rebounds continue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>But if the circle lines break onely asunder, and extend, or shut forth into straight lines without more parts, there is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lightning without thunder, but if those lines break into more parts, there is thunder also, and when there falls r ain at those times of thunder, it is when the gentler motions of some of those expulsed parts, do not strike hard upon some of those unbroken circles, but presse upon them, which caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to draw, and gather into a lesse circle, and a grosser line, untill they return into the watry compasse, where grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too heavy for the hight, falls down toward the center of the earth, as all heavie bodies, if not thick bodies under to bear them up, or stronger motions then their weight to hold them

up, thus in my opinion is thunder and lightning caused, and when it rains, those unbroken circles return into its nature again.</p>

                     </gap>, the passions are made in the head; others that they are made in the heart; for my part I am of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter opinion; that is, that all passions are made in the heart; as Love, Hate, Fear, Anger, Grief, Jealousie, Envy, Malice, and the like; and also the Will, and opinions, which are a kinde of passions; and that imaginations, conceptions, fancies, understanding, judgment, memory, and remembrance, is made in the brain; and that which we call thought, or ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal knowledg is made both in the brain and heart; for if either of these two parts be wounded, that knowledg dies, as both the sensitive knowledg, and rational, both being that which we call thought, the one belongs to the body, the other to the minde; for touch is a weak thought, and thought a strong touch; and my reason is why I think that the passions are crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the heart, and not in the head, is, first, passion and judgment seldom agree.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when we have the passion of fear or anger, or the like; all the motions that work to those passions, are felt in the heart; for if we do observe, we shall finde all passions arise from the heart, and all the parts near thereto will be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed; when in the brain we finde no violent motions at all, perchance the sensitive part may be disturbed, as to make the head-ache, as with a general distemper.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there are oft times passions felt as it were in the heart, without any knowledg, or thought of it in the head; as when we shall be sad, and angry, and fearful, and know no reason why. Besides, objects many times passe by, or as it were, steal through the senses, and likewise creep through the brains, and raise a passion in the heart, without any notice ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thereof, or knowledg how it came therein.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, that although there is a great sympathy betwixt the passions, and imaginations, yet they are not after one and the same manner of motions, which sheweth they are created in several figures, the one in the triangular heart, &amp; the other in the spherical brain, and the different shapes of the head and heart, may be one cause, that makes the difference betwixt passions and imaginations, as well as the different motions.</p>
                  <p>But to prove passions are made in the heart, and not in the head, is, that when the brain is distempered and mad, as we say, yet the passions may be free and regular; and Love, and Hate, which are the two chief passions, may be constant to the objects they were placed on; thus the minde or soul, which is the rational innate matter, lies as much in the heart, as the head.</p>

                  <p>But different passions are made according to the subjects or objects they move by, or to; yet the rational innated matter which creates passions, may move partly sympathetically, and partly antipathetically, at one and the same time. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, a man may be in love with a woman, for her beauty, or wit, or behaviour, and yet have an aversion to her bad qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; but a man cannot love the person of a woman, and hate it, at one and the same time, but to the creating of those pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, that sympathies, as love, and hope, and joy, and the like; The rational innate matter, doth as it were spread, and delate its self; but for those passions that antipathies, it contracts it self more together; as in hate, fears, jealousies, doubts, envy, spight, and the like; and when two or three passions arise at one time; as a passion of grief for my friend that is killed, and a passionate hate to his murtherer, or the like; then the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal innated matter, divides its self, partly moving after one manner, and partly moving after a quite contrary manner, and so may divide into as many parts, and after as many several manners, as their place or quantity will give way to; but when we love what was hated, or hate what was loved, then the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate matter changes their motions, towards such a subject, or object, without a division; but when they move disorderly, the passions are like a tempest at Sea; passions beat against passions in a confused manner, distempering the whole body, causing the senses to mistake, with the violence thereof; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in the brain there may be opposite motions, amongst one and the same degree of innated matter, either rational or sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, either by an alteration of motion in one and the same part of matter, or by divisions moving in parts; but when the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall innate matter moves in a regular division, and the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of time, and the notes of motions skilfully set, and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept, that is curiously or neatly, and carefully ordered; then there is a harmony, which harmony is a quiet minde, gentle imaginations, a clear understanding, a solid judgment, eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fancies, and ready memory; but when this rational innated matter moves disorderly, there arises extravagant fancies, false reasons, misunderstandings, and the like.</p>

                  <p>THe reason why we may have millions of several figures in our memory at one time, so likewise raised up to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, when we can receive but one perfect figure through our senses at one time, is that the passages for outward objects to enter, is so straight in all animal figures, as that but one object can take place therein, I mean as being perfectly
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48875:68"/>
distinct, for the passages being straight, many objects entring at once, make a confusion, at least a disorder, for if more then one object be presented at one time, to any particular sense, they are received but by piece-meals, as in the small parts; and many times the divided parts are so mixt together, as no piece is perfectly seen or heard, or smelt, or tasted, or touched; besides, the passages being straight, the sensitive innate matter cannot work so regular, having not liberty, for it is not with the sensitive innate matter as with the rational innate matter, by reason the sensitive innate matter works upon gross materials, as upon the dull part of matter, which makes that it cannot move so nimbly, nor divide into parts so suddenly, especially in a straight passage, as the rational innate matter can, which moves onely in number and measure, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any dull mixture, for the rational innate matter, can figure out the whole world, and millions of several figures therein, sooner and swifter then the sensitive innate matter, can print one figure upon any of the senses; and not onely those figures that the sensitive innate matter presents, or hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, but makes those figures that were never presented, as those we call phantasms; and as I said the rational innate mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath more room to move in, as in the head, and heart, then the sensitive innate matter, hath in the ear, eye, nostrils, mouth, or pores of the flesh, so there may be a greater quantity, or proportion of that rational moving matter together, in a body, or bulk, as I may say, then of the sensitive innate matter, in the foresaid passages, and according as the quantity of the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional matter is, there is the more knowledge, and clearer understanding; the quicker wit, and the livelier memory, the fresher remembrance, and the more multiplicity of thoughts; for it is not onely the largeness, and extent of the place wherein the rational matter moves in, that makes the more knowledg and understanding, and the like, but the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the rational matter; for a great head may have but a little wit, or dim understanding, and a little head a quick wit, and clear understanding; if the little head be full of this ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal innate matter, and the great head be empty thereof; but if the room (or place) be large, and filled with this sort of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate matter, according to the bigness, that creature will be very knowing, understanding, and ingenious; for imagin that all the heads of mankinde were put into the compass of one head, and a sufficient quantity of that rational matter therein, that creature whatsoever it were, would have not onely the knowledg of every particular brain joyned together, but that knowledg and understanding would increase as use-money, for that bulk or bank would multiply, being put together.</p>

                  <p>MAny wonder what Thoughts are, and how such mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions can be within so little a compasse as the brain.</p>
                  <p>I answer, that a little quantity of the rational innate mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, may make millions of figures, which figures are thoughts.</p>
                  <p>As for example, from eight notes, milions of tunes are made, and from twenty four letters millions of several Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages may be made.</p>
                  <p>Likewise one lump of clay may be molded, and formed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to millions of several figures; and like Pictures many figures<note place="margin">The world is presented like a popit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play in the head.</note> may be drawn in one piece, and every figure in a several po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture; Likewise a little picture will represent so great an Army, as would take up many acres of land, were it in a pitched field.</p>
                  <p>Again, a Globe no bigger then a Head, will present the whole world.</p>
                  <p>Again, say some, how is it possible there should be so many several thoughts in the head at one time, and how from one thought should there arise so many of a sudden, and at some times so extravagant as to have no coherence therein, at other times very methodicall, and sympathetical?</p>
                  <p>To the first I answer, how many several postures may a man put his body into at one time, nay, I may say one part of the body? for how many several postures may the face draw it self into at one time?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I answer, that many several wheels will move with one motion, nay with one kinde of motion several wayes, and many wheels with several motions several wayes, and all within one, and the same compasse, and from one prime spring. Again, some may wonder how it is possible figurative thoughts can inlarge and contract the demension, and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; I answer, how is it with Prospective glasses, convex, and concave glasses; likewise a screen, or a fan, or the like, which can fold in many folds, into one fold, then can draw them out into a plain straight piece again, and so shut up into a fold, or open in a plain piece, as often and as quick as a thought, and millions of the like examples, may be given, but these are enough for this time, on this subject.</p>

thoughts, for displeasing thoughts of grief, and all sad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances cause the minde to be dull, and melancholly, or froward, and discontented; and pleasing thoughts cause the minde to be chearful, pleasant, and delightful. Besides, the minde is like chewing of the cud, for what the senses bring in, and are fed with outward objects; those swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed objects, the thoughts of the minde chews over again; thus the minde is alwayes feeding; besides, the senses have no longer pleasure, or pain then the objects remain; but the minde is as much grieved, or delighted when the object is removed, as when they are present; As for example, a man is as much grieved when he hears his friend is dead, or kill'd, as if he saw him die, or slaine; for the dead fried lives in the minde, not the minde in the dead friend, and if a man have a fine house, or great riches, or an excellent rare race of horses, or the like, whereupon the minde takes as great delight in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his fine house, as if it dwelt in the house, and as great delight in thinking of his riches, or what he could do with the use of his riches; for the minde doth not so much dwell in the house, as the house in the minde, nor the minde doth not take so much delight in the use of the riches, as the use to be in the minde, and the remembrance of the curious horses is as much in the minde, as when those horses were in the eye; for when the sense is filled, the minde can but think, and the minde may as well think when the objects are gone, as when they are present, and the minde may take as much delight, in thinking what the senses have enjoyed, as what they are to injoy, or desire to enjoy; for thoughts are the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the minde, as objects the fruition of the senses; for the minde takes as much delight (if not more) in thinking of an absolute power, as when the commands of an absolute power is obeyed, for obedience dwells no more in the minde when it is acted, then it did before it was acted, or by the imagination that it is acted; thus the minde receives no more by action, then it doth by contemplation, onely when the pleasure of the senses are joyned with delightful thoughts, may be said to be more happy, though I beleeve the pleasure of senses draws the delight from the thoughts; for the more at rest the body is, the more busie the minde is imployed, and as torments of the minde are beyond the torments of the body, or at least the displeasure of the senses; so the delight of the minde is beyond the ease or rest of the body, or the pleasure of the senses.</p>

the inside of the optick nerve, as on the inside of the pia ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as the waking motion doth on the outside, and when we hear them as it were discourse words, right on the inside of the drum of the ear, or pia mater, by the sensitive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as on the outside when we are awake; for all the sensitive works inwards asleep, as outward awake; for if we smell sents pleasing, or displeasing, the sensitive spirits draw lines, and set notes on the inside of the dura mater and pia mater of the brain; and so for taste and touch, they draw plate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms in the inside of the skin, either of the skin of the tongue, or any other outward parts of the body, as they do on the outside of the skin awake; Thus the senses present as perfect prints to the rational oft times in sleep, as awake, onely they print on the inside a sleep, and on the outside awake, and what rational creature would not beleeve their senses; for should a man see another man die, and see him buried, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards should see that man alive again, and hear him speak, and touch him, shall feel the substance of flesh, would not he think he lived? <hi>Thomas</hi> the Apostle questions the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Saviours resurrection from the grave, but never questioned his senses, when he saw, and touched him; so in our dreames, when the sensitive innate matter prints such fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures on the optick nerve, as of such a person which is dead, the rational matter straight paterns out the sensitive print; and when the sensitive print, and the rational figure is just a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, the other motion of the rational matter cannot questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the truth of that figure, or figures being there, though they may question how they come alive, again treating with it, as if awake, the same is if the sensitive innated prints, any thing as dead, which is living, and the rational pattern it, the rest of the rational motions make no question of the truth of those sleeping motions, untill waking motions otherwayes inform them; for rational motion in every particular figure, knows little of the sensitive, but what the senses shews them, in the several motions, yet the rational generally knows what they present unto them, which every particular sense doth not, each motion is unknown, and are strangers to each other in one and the same figure; for the ear knows not what the eye seeth, nor the eyes know not what the nose smelleth, nor the nose knows not what the tongue tasts, nor the tongue knows not what the body feels, but the rational innat matter in a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, knows all the sensitive motions in the same figure, as long as the figure is perfect, and moves in an Animal way, and that the rational motion moves regular; for when the motions are irregular, they can take no perfect copies, nor notice how the sensitive move, that is, the reason that in perturbed passions, which are onely irregular motions, the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses become as it were uselesse to them, but most commonly the disorder of one brings the disorder of the other, I will not say at all times, and so when the sensitive spirits are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48875:71"/>
the rational is regular, but not at all times, for some times the one is regular, the other is not, but the rational which takes copies of the sensitives is oftener disordered by the sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, then the sensitives by the rational, for when there is grief in the minde, many times the body is in good health, but it is seldom known when the body is sick, but the minde is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</p>

                  <p>THe reason that many times we dream of walking woods or houses, and the like, is through this following reason; The rational innate matter, as I often said before, turns most commonly into such figures, as the sensitive innate matter prints, or hath printed upon the senses, now if a tree or house, or the like, be printed on the inside of the <hi>pia mater,</hi> or the like sensitive part, when we are asleep, the rational innate matter straight figures them, these figures move after a local manner, although they have not an animal, or local shape; the reason is, that the rational innated matter being purer in it self, without the mixture of dull matter, moves onely in their own matter, and the figure moves in the matter; whereas the sensitive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated matter working upon the dull part of matter, moves in that dull matter, and not the dull matter in the sensitive inna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted matter, that is the sensitive innate matter moves in the dull part of matter, and the dull part of matter is moved by the sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive innate matter; thus the sensitive figure is moved, but not moving, but the rational innated matters figures give their own motions; likewise if we have seen a battle, or heard of a battle, and afterwards we dream of the same, or of the like battle; then the rational innated matter puts its self into animal figures, and moves after a local manner, each figure placing it self after that manner or way as was related, or printed by the senses, or after away of its own invention, and when the figures encounter each other, as they must do to fight a battle in the brain; and then some seeme to be falling, and others dead, and some mangled; those figures are as falling and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and cease to move after the local manner; and when one party seems to move as in a confusion, then the motions are irregular, and just as the senses present, so doth the rational innated matter act in the brain when we sleep, and sometimes when we are awake, as in imagination.</p>

                  <p>THe general opinion is, that all objects come through the optick nerve, and print the figures received on the brain, and that there are, nor can be no figures in the brain, but what the opticks bring in, and have passed through the eye; it is true, by experience we finde, that without an eye, we cannot see an outward object, as they are without us, yet we see those objects, as they are without us in our sleep when our eyes be shut; thus the sense of seeing is not lost, although the eyes were out, and the optick nerves stopped up. But some will say, those objects in dreams have past through in part, or in whole, therefore the question will be, where an animal can have an insight, if it were born blinde; but if it be so, as the opinion is, that no figure, or insight can be, but what comes,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48875:73"/>
or hath passed through the eye, and optick nerve, must want that sensible knowledge; for according to that opinion, the ear can do the understanding no service as toward that sense, by reason sound can make no figure to sight, neither will taste, nor sent; but some may say, touch may discover some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of that sense to the understanding, but I think not; for in my opinion, touch is as senssesse to insight as sound; for we cannot comprehend more of touch then of sound, for depth and breadth are no more to insight, then high notes, and low notes, nor soft nor hard, no more to insight then swift, and slow, sharp, or flat, nor pleasure, nor pain, no more then harmony, and discord; but my opinion is, that figures are as inherent to the minde, as thoughts; And who can have an unfigurative thought, for the minde cannot have thoughts, but upon some matter, and there is no matter but must have some figure, for who can think of nothing; but the minde is like infinite nature, having no dimension, or extention, no center, nor circumference, no breadth, no depth, and as the innat matter creates figures, so the minde, which is the matter creates thoughts, which thoughts, are the figures of the minde; for when we hear of a deity, we say in words it is an incorporeal thing; but we cannot conceive it so in thought, we say we do, but we cannot prove we do; Tis true, the minde may be in a maze, and so have no fixt thought of any particular thing; yet that amaze hath a figurative ground, although not subscribed; as for example, my eyes may see the sea, or air, yet not the compasse, and so the earth, or heavens; so likewise my eye may see a long pole, yet not the two ends, these are but the parts of these figures, but I see not the circumference to the uttermost extention, so the mind in amaze, or the amaze of thinking cuts not out a whole and distinct figurative thought, but doth as it were spread upon a flat, without a circumference, and though there are not such figures in the<note place="margin">All innate matter is as the minde, or life of nature.</note> brain, as it brought through the opticks, yet such figures as the minde creates; for the minde is innate matter, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat matter is self-motion, and self-motion, is alwayes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and working, which working is figuring; thus the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitives innated matter prints figures iu the brain, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional innated matter creates figures in the brain after its own invention, which are imagination and conception, wherein are made imaginary worlds, without the materials of outward objects: and perchance these motions may create such a figure as this world, and such several figures, as the several creatures therein, although not so solid and lasting, because those motions want those grosse materials, of which they should create it withal; but the sensitive innated matter in this cause, prints these figures upon the brain by patterning the rational figures created in the brain, like as when it doth the outward objects,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48875:74"/>
and when the sensitive innate matter works on the inside, as in sleep, then it gives an insight, which are dreams according to their copied prints, and these motions may make lines of light, triangular lines, for colours set notes of tunes, draw plat-forms<note place="margin">All without outward help</note> of taste, and sent, make prints of touch, not onely the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal innated matter, by imagination; but the sensitive inna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted matter gives a sensible touch on the brain of all the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward senses, by which touch, I mean sensible knowledge; thus the interior motions may move the brain with the variety of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very sense, without the exterior passages, or objects,<note place="margin">The property of each sense.</note> and although it may not make those very objects and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; yet such as are proper for each sense, and of the same nature as I said before, draw lines of light, gathering motions make clouds, triangular motions make colours, insnarled motions make darknesse without the outward object, and all other motions that make several figures, or printed figures.</p>
                  <p>Likewise reflections without the help of the eye and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds, and retorts; for sound, and set notes print words, and plain tunes without the ear; so likewise for taste, sent, and touch; but when the brain is filled withoutward objects, the natural motion seldom works after their own invention, having not room as it were, or else it is as it were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred with work, having more objects brought in, then they can either conveniently place or sort, or distinguish; but weak minds, which are slow moving matter, think life an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible thing, and the head, or brain empty of figures, when it is not filled with outward objects, like as a barrel is not<note place="margin">Fools have lesse rational innated mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in their braines, then those that are wise.</note> filled with liquor, thinks it empty, because the thin air with which it is filled, is not subject to their grosse senses, so not to their weak capacities.</p>
                  <p>Thus it is not the outward objects that make the sense, but the innate matter, which is self motion, which is the sense and knowledge, and the different motions therein, and therefrom, make the differences thereof, and though different sense and knowledge, may be in different, and several figures, and such kind of sense &amp; knowledge proper for such kind of sorts of figures; yet the figure adds nothing to the sense, and knowledge, although the innated matter may give a figure such a kind of sense and knowledge and when that figure dies, that kinde of sense and knowledge may alter, which was proper to that kinde of figure; yet if it were the figure that gave the sense, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and not the innated motions, there would be no alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on when the figure is made, or any extraordinary passion, whereby experience we finde the sense, and knowledge do alter all, though the figure be perfect, and in health.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>Blindnesse proceeds from many causes, as when the cristalline part of the eye is not clear; for if it be dimming, or failing, or spotted and foul, the objects seem muddy, and misty, and as the water of the cristaline is coloured, so the objects appear; for as Diamonds, some are of a black wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, others of a yellow water, some of a green water, or blue, others of a white water; so is the cristalline part of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral eyes, and according as it is clear, or coloured, so all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects appear.</p>
                  <p>A second defect may be in the ball of the eye; for accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the compasse of the concave, or convex thereof, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are presented neerer, or at a further distance, or longer or shorter, or broader, or narrower.</p>
                  <p>A third defect may be in the eye hole; for according to the largenesse, or littlenesse thereof, objects are presented, either in whole, or in part, bigger, or lesser, more, or fewer objects enter at once; for if the eye-lid hole should be too large, the species would disperse too much, disuniting parts and figures, and if too small, the species cannot passe in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                     </gap> and file, as I may say; for though the smaller the circle is, the closer it contracts the species, and draws the objects into a straighter line; yet if they should passe in a crowd, they will stop the mouth of the passage, like water in a glasse when turned
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48875:75"/>
suddenly downward, every drop striving to get out first hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders each others so in the strife, as none can passe.</p>
                  <p>A fourth defect may be in the optick nerve, if it be full of slime, and the like, it darknens the sight, stopping the passage of the light, or if it be shrunk, or dried up, likewise if the head be full of grosse vapours, it obscures the sight, as a thick mist doth the sun; for this foul foggy, and grosse vapors hinder the species from entring, and the sensitive innated matter that should print these objects, on the optick nerve, and if they are not quite stopt, yet it hinders the regularity, making that innated matter to work by piece-meales, or else staies not so long, as to take a perfect survay.</p>
                  <p>The fift and sixth defect may be, if the eyes move too quick, or too slow, which makes the sight imperfect, or dull; for too quick motions of the eye dazles the sight, and clips and cuts the exterior objects into so many parts, as no one part can be perfectly known, or seen; and too slow motion blunts the sight like a sharp point that is struck upon a stone, or the like; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, when it is fixt too long upon one object, other objects passe by before it removes, or wearies it so much as one cannot take notice of it; But when the eyes are too quick, it is by reason the nerve strings that tie and fasten the ball of the eye to the head, are too slack, which makes the eye ball so loose as the least motion moves it, or else these nervous strings are too small which makes them so weak, as every little motion moves, so as they are alwayes in motion as it were; for if the nerves, and sinew-strings be too small for the weight of the eye ball, it may alwayes have a trembling motion, like a sthe aspen, or like weights that cannot poise steddy, as long as there is a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion; and when the eyes are too slow the reason is when the sinews, or nerve-strings, are so short tied, or shrunk up, so that it holds the eye ball too hard, or too straight, giving it not liberty to stir, and turn from side to side, or to role a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout.</p>
                  <p>A seventh defect may be when the eyes look asquint, as it may do two several wayes; the one is when the ball of the eye is tied too short, by the nervous string towards the nose, by which the balls of either eye, are drawn so much inward to each other, as to look at each other; but that they are some wayes hindered by the nose, this makes the lines or points; that shoot from either eye, to meet acrosse, which makes all exterior objects to look double; but if the eye string ties the balls of the eyes too short towards the temples it draws the points from the center, and the eyes out of the natural bias which causeth a side look, as seeing two several wayes at once, but neither way perfectly, by reason that the lines that issue from the eyes, lie not level, neither can those lines meet upon an object, in a triangular, which joyns

                  <p>Thus if the strings be too loose, or too hard, or too small, or that the optick is shrunk up, or the eye-lid-hole covered with some scale, or filme, or the eye-lid-hole too little or too big, or the christalline full, or the brain full, or too many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours continually ascending from the bowels, or stomach, or if the eye be too quick, or too slow, it is a great defect in sight; But if the passage be quite stopped up, of the strings or christal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line part be broke, those are irrecoverably blinde.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>IT is strange if we consider that one word should strike so many several ears, and so to be heard perfectly, by every particular ear; but surely to my reason one word or note can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fill so many ears, as can stand to hear it: again, it is strange that a word should directly hit into every ear that stands to hear it, I will not say alwayes, for sometimes a word is spoke two or three times over, although the ear be clear before it can hit the entrance, but that is but seldome; but in my opinion it is not a single word that runs about from ear to ear, for then all would not hear at once, for if there were a multitude, the last ear might not hear a week after,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48875:76"/>
or at least a day after it had been spoken.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore in my opinion it must be after this manner, the mouth, tongue, and breath formes not onely a single word, but millions in one lump, with the same labour of pains, as for one word; as for example, take a sheet of paper, or the like, and fold it into many folds, in a small compass, and stamp a print thereon, and every fold shall have the like print with one stamp, and until they are parted they stick so close as if they were but one printed body, when every fold is divided by the stamp with the print thereon; so likewise the mouth folds up thin air, and the tongue gives the printed stamp, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cast forth like a ball of wilde-fire, disperseth in a crack or sound, and then suddenly spreads about in several streams; thus millions of words run about in lines of air, passing in all pores and hollow bodies, as the ear or the like, concaves as hollow wood and vaults, where finding resistance, rebounds back in repetitions, and according to their strength, or the strength of their bearing motions, they pierce farther and fall shorter, and according to the freeness of the passage, they sound louder, clearer, lower, or duller, and according to their stamp they are perfect or imperfect.</p>
                  <p>After the same manner is all distinct sounds, notes being printed as words, but sounds without distinction, are like stamps without prints, that is plain pieces of air, but if the ear be stopped, the sound is lost to the brain, I will not say to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural sense, for surely the brain is not the whole ingrosser of that and the like sensitive knowledg, neither will say the animal head ingrosses all that sort of tempered matter, or that no pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage can conveigh a sound but the animal ear. But most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably all sounds spread as lights; as for example, a small candle will enlighten a large compass, by reason rayes of light streame equally from the center candle to the circumference; so is sound: for when a pistol, or any the like shots of a bullet, the pistol, or that which makes the sound, is the center which spreads sound as fire doth light, and when such a compass of air is filled with sound, either vocal or verbal, every ear that stands in the compass must needs receive the sound if they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>I say that is impossible, unless the ear could draw the sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or streaming lines from the circumference to a point, which the ear cannot.</p>
                  <p>But I believe art may do the same for sound as it can with light; for art can draw with glasses made for that purpose,

                  <p>Also they can draw several species, through a small hole.</p>

Thirdly, a swimming, or diseases in the head, are different from both the other, it is a third sort of sense, neither is any other part of the body subject to this disease, but the head not properly, yet faintnesse, or weaknesse is a disease, as it were tempered with the three former diseases, as to have pain, sick, and dissy, or swimming, to be mixt or compounded into one disease, but it is so mixt and compounded into all three, as neither is perfectly or distinctly felt; so as it is no distinct sense<note place="margin">As sauces may be equally mixt with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral sorts of things, as none can tast any one thing in it.</note> this disease is generall to the whole body. The fift is mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, this sense is neither painful, nor sick, nor dissy, but light in the head, which is different from dissy or swimming; but this disease infecteth with a distemper, the five outward senses. The last is a numbnesse, and deadnesse of particular parts; and sometimes of the whole body; but this disease is not onely a different sense, but an other nature, which is naturally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the figure; for the figure is not any wayes sensible thereof; indeed it is of the nature of sowning; for those that sown, the motions of the animal sense, and minde are quite altered for a time, but then the animal motions return, that is, rechanged to the proper motions again, so that those dead parts

Again, there are other sorts of sicknesse in the stomack, caused by such motions, as are like the rolling of a barrel, the humour turning about in the figure of a barrel, which figure, or the like, is somewhat bigger in the middle, then the two ends, this humour in the stomack is most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly tough and thick, being more united, and somtimes one end of this humour is as set upward, and the other down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and so turned as a barrel with the head upward, and sometimes moved as a barrel the longest way on the ground, these motions cause neither purging by vomits, nor stool, but thrust out into cold sweats; for though these are not so strong

                  <p>A Dead palsie is not onely made by mis-tempered matter, and disordered motions, but by unnatural motions, as improper to the nature of that kinde of figure, working, or mis-working most commonly upon the exterior parts, drawing up or shutting close those passages that should be open, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by contrary motions, from the nature of the figure, which causes insensibility, but as long as the vital parts be untouch'd, which are the stewards, and trustees, to the life of the body, which are to dispose, discharge, and direct, to take in and lay out, for the subsistance of the body (as I may say) as long as these are untouch'd, the life of the body may subsist, although the other particular parts be as we say dead, or lost to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural use of the body. A numb palsie is of the same nature, but not of the same degree; as for comparison, a dead palsie is, as if a door, for common and necessary passage, should be close shut and lock'd, or nail'd up; and a numb palsie is as if the door or doors should be half open, and according as it is open, or shut, the numb palsie is more or less, but both dead; and numb palsies are occasioned by some unnatural contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for if it were by some unnaturall expulsions, the parts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected would rot, and fall from the other parts, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Wherefore in these diseases there must be applied opening medicines that work dilatively, and if they be caused from a cold contraction, then hot dilating medicines must be applied, but if they proceed from hot contractions, the cold dilating medicines must be applied; but the difficulty and skill will be to finde whether they proceed from cold, or heat, although most commonly, all physicians do apply in these diseases, very hot and dry medicines, which are contracting, which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines are quite contrary to the nature of the diseases, which makes them cure so few, but the surest way is to apply dilating medicines, whether hot or cold.</p>

                  <p>A Sleepy numbness is also caused by obstruction or stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pages; as for example, if any over-burthensome weight lies upon the arm, or hand, or the like, it will become numb, which is vulgarly called sleepy; the reason is, that pressing too hard upon those parts, we stop the pores, which by touch is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; for if the pores be close shut, touch cannot enter, no more then if the eye be shut an outward object can enter, or
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48875:81"/>
stopping the ears, or nose, a sound, or scent can enter; as we may finde by experience; for if any part is bound too hard, it strait becomes numb, likewise a violent blow; or when any part is tied too hard, that part becomes numb, the reason is, by striking or thrusting back the bloud; for the bloud is like a running company, which when they are forcibly beaten back, on those companies that are thrusting forward, unite by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction into so firm a body, that no particular part can stir; which solid and thick body stops the pores of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Likewise the sleepy numbness may proceed from a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity of vapor, which flying to the pores for vent may stop the passage, by too great a concourse, being more vapor then sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vent; but any alteration of motion cures it, by dispersing the vapor, more thin and evenly.</p>

                  <p>Besides, the veins and little small strings that run about the brain, being contracted with cold, the bloud in those veins cannot so freely run, and those strings being shrunk, make the brain feel as if it were so hard bound, as to be numb; but this doth rather afright the life of the diseased, then destroy it; for a little warmth by rubbing the head, or a hot cloth laid on the head, or some warm spoon-meat cures it.</p>
                  <p>Also numbness may proceed from too much bloud in the veins, or too much matter in the nerves, for being too full causeth a stopping, for want of space or room to move naturally in; but this numbness is not so easily cured, especially when the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions lie in the nerves, for opening a vein gives liberty to the bloud; but I know not how one should so easily open a nerve, neither is the matter within so liquid, as suddenly to run out; but this numbness is rather of the nature of a dead numbness, then a sleepy numbness.</p>

                  <p>MAdnesse belongs not onely to the head, as that onely the eye, ear, nose, and mouth, sees, hears, smels, and tasts extravagantly; but every other part of the body that is sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible<note place="margin">In mad fits.</note> of touch; for extravagant touch, is as much as extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant sight, and the like; for touch of the brest, or any other part of the body, is a sense, as much as the eye in the head; thus the body, or senses will be mad as well as the minde, as I have described in former chapters.</p>
                  <p>Likewise for the madnesse in the minde, it is not alwayes bound in the head; for where there are extravagant passions in the heart, the minde is as mad, as when there are extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant imaginations, in the head; for the rational matter, that which we call the soul, or minde is as much, and hath as much recourse to the heart, as to the head, and so to the other parts of the body, for any thing I can perceive.</p>
                  <p>But that matter I call the rational and sensitive spirits, <note n="*" place="margin">If I mistake not.</note> which others call the animal, and vital spirits; perchance fools may think me extravagant for giving the matter other names; but I was forced to take these names, because they were more significant to the sense of my discourse; besides, perchance they may think, when I speak of rational and sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive spirits, that they are hobgoblins, ghosts, or visions, such as nurses fright their children with, or superstitions, or as the wiser sort doth to make credulous fools beleeve to keep them in awe, knowing they are apt to disorders.</p>

                  <p>THere is great reason why Musick should cure madnesse; for this sort of madnesse is no other but the spirits that are in the brain and heart put out of their natural motion, and the spirits having a natural sympathy with Musick, may be compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed into their right order; but it must be such Musick, as the number of the notes must goe in such order as the natural mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the brain, though every brain hath not one and the same motion, but are set like notes to several tunes: wherefore if it were possible, to set notes to the natural motion of the heart, or that brain that is distempered, it might be perfectly cured, but as some notes do compose the brain by a sympathy to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural motion, so others do make a discord or antipathy, and discompose it, putting the natural motions out of tune.</p>

                  <p>THere are many several sorts or manners of fevors; but I will onely treat of the fundamental fevours, which are three, from which three all other fevors are partly derived; the first is a malignant fevor, the second the hective fevor; and the third the ordinary burning fevours; the first is catching, and often dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the second is never catching, but alwayes deadly; the third is neither catching, and seldom deadly; the first proceeds from vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent disordered motions, and distempered matter, and humour.<note place="margin">Which is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt humors.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second from swift motions, which distemper and make waste of the matter, which matter, I mean the substance of the body.</p>
                  <p>The third is too violent motions on well tempered<note place="margin">As a sound body.</note> matter.</p>
                  <p>And these three sorts of fevours are often mixt, as it were a part of all mixt into one; but a high malignant fevor, is a sudden usurpation; for the disordered motions joyned with a mistempered matter, which is corrupt humours, surprise the body, and destroy the life therein, as we shall see in great plagues, the body is well, sick, and dead in a moment; these or the like diseases are caused after three manner of wayes, as being taken from outward infection, or bred by an evil habit in the body, or by taking some disagreeing mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter therein, which causeth a war of sicknesse; for upon the<note place="margin">Surfets, or unholsom meats.</note> disorder which the disagreeing matter makes, the natural mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions belonging to the body grow factious, and like a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rout arise in an uproar, which strives onely to do mischief, stopping some passages that should be kept open, and opening

                  <p>For it is against the nature of the innated matter to be idle, wherefore it works rather irregularly then not work at all, but as long as a body lies sick, the power is divided, one part of the innated matter working irregularly, the other according to the natural constitution, which by the regularity, they strive to maintain the chief forts of life which are the vital parts, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the heart, and disordered motions striving to take, or pull them down, making their strongest assaults thereon; for the disordered innated matter makes out-works of corrupted matter, stopping as many passages as their power will give leave, so striving either to starve the vital parts, or to oppresse them with corruption, or to burn them by their unnatural heat they make in the body, or to drown them with watrish humor which is caused by the distemper of ill disgestions, and obstructions; the regular innated matter, strives to break down those works, and to cast, and expel that filth out of the body,<note place="margin">Some dayes the body <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>IN malignant diseases expelling medicines are best, which expelling medicines are not hot, and dry medicines, for all<note place="margin">As hot and dry Cordials.</note> drugs that are naturally dry, have a contracting quality which is an utter enemy in this disease; for they must be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating medicines, and all dilating medicines have a fluid faculty working after the nature of a flowing tide, which is thrusting, or streaming outward, as to the circumference, and the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of drying medicines, are like the ebbing tide that draws backward or inward, as to it self; but as I said before, that all hot and dry medicines have a contracting quality, which contractions draw or gather up the malignity, as in a bundle or heap together, and if it be a fiery contraction, it sets it on a fire, which burns out the life of the body; for fire makes no distinguishment of good or bad, but destroyes all it can in compasse, so as it will not onely burn up the superfluities, or corruptions, but suck or drink up the radical moisture, or char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coales, the vital parts, and consumes the animal life. Wherefore dilating medicines, must be applied in these diseases, but not strong expulsives medicine, by reason the malignity is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixt, or spread in the, body that striving with a strong force to cast forth the malignity they should cast forth the nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and consistent matter, for the malignity, and corrupt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours being more strong, having a greater party, can resist with more strength the force of expulsion then the nourishing,

                  <p>AS for the Producing diseases by conceit, is thus; the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal spirits which are the motions of life, have an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power over the body, as working every part thereof, and therein, so the animal spirits which are the motions of the mind create imaginations, and conceptions, and the animal spirits and the vital spirits being as man and wife, the animal as the husband, the vital spirits as the wife, whereupon the animal spirits many times beget that desease it figures which is an imagination, and the vital spirits brings that childe forth, being like the figure the animal spirits made, that is, the vital spirits oft times work such motions as makes such diseases, wherefore the animal spirits work those motions into imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and to prove it, those that conceit they shall have the small pox, measels, pleague, or the like, most commonly they fall sick of that disease, although they come not neer the infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and to prove the animal spirits which is the minde, works the same motions by an imagination as the disease is, that those which conceit a disease, do not fall sick of any other disease but the same they imagine, and the reason why these malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant diseases are produced oftner by imaginations then other diseases, is, that those diseases are dangerous, or that they are apt to deform which makes a fearful conception or imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to work more strongly; for did the imiginations work as strong to other diseases as to these, they would produce the same effects; As for those which are cured by conceit, is when<note place="margin">I meane there interior strength.</note> the motion of the animal spirits works stronger then the vital spirits, which causeth the vital spirits to altar those motions that made such diseases; but those effects are produced but seldom, by reason that the animal spirits seldom work so strong imaginations, for it requires a double, or treble strength to resist or alter the force another way, which must be to cure a disease after this manner, then to joyn and assist, as in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing

                  <p>THe reason why malignant diseases, as the plague, or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, or small pox, measels, or the like; there break forth spots, swelling scabs, or whelks, is by the power of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling motion; But the reason why it sticks in the flesh, and not quite out, is, because the irregular motions that maintain the health and strength of the body, are opposed by disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly motions, which makes corrupted matter, that makes disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered motions; for though there can be no corrupted matter, but what is caused from disordered motion, yet when the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors of the body are once corrupted, the motions are more violent; again, superabundant humors, cause disordered motions; for as there is too much humor, obstructing the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy therewith, so there is too much motion, to work regularly therein, and being against the natural constitution to have so much humor, and motion, it produceth violent sickness, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the destruction, and not to the maintenance of the body; but the regular motions, which are digestive motions, which unites, strengthens, and defends the vital parts, by atracting good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                     </gap>, by retaining the useful parts; by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocting it into a sollid substance, by expelling of superfluieties, or malignancy out of the body, after a methodical manner, and according as the strength of expelling motions are, so is the malignity, cast forth, for if the repelling motions be stronger then the expelling motion, the malignant presses so hard upon the vital parts, as it smothers the life therein, or burns up the materials thereof: Again, the expelling motions may be so weak, as they cannot thrust out the malignity so far as the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of the body which is the skin, or if so far, yet not to stay there so long, as to evapor it out, and then the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity fals back with a greater violence; for what is forced, and resisteth, when once it hath liberty, or gets power, it becomes more violent, by how much more it were forced; but that malignity that doth evaporate forth, doth insensibly enter into the next body it meets; entring through the nostrils, mouth, or pores of the flesh; and thus many times, from animal to animal untill there is a general infection, which is a general disorder, for the malignity that enters in by infection, is like a

                  <p>ALL sweating diseases are caused by such kinde of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuating motions, as melt metal, and not by such kinde of extenuating motions as evaporate water, for the evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the watery part of the body breath forth in insensible transpirations, as breathing through the pores like a thin air; but sweat runs through the pores like liquid oar through gutters of earth: but sweats are good or bad for the body, according to the matter or humors that are melted out, as for example; I will compare the humors of the body to several metals, as Iron, Lead, Tin, Copper, Silver and Gold; Iron is melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly dust; Lead is cold, and dry or cold, and moist melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly; Tin is flegm; Copper is choler; Silver is the radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal humor; and God is the vital spirits: These humors must be proportionably tempered to make a healthful body; there must not be too much quantity of Lead, Tin, or Copper, for the Silver or Gold, but unless there be some, they will not work; like as coyn, it cannot be wrought, or formed without some allay, and if the allay be too much, it abases the coyn.</p>
                  <p>Likewise there must be so much heat in the body onely as to compound those humors, not to melt them out by sweats unless they superabound; and then Physicians must onely have a care to melt out that humor that superabounds; for if the radical humor should be melted, or the vital spirits spent, it destroys the body by wasting the life.</p>
                  <p>But in some cases sweating is very beneficial to the body, as in great colds, which have knit up the pores or passages of the body, or in great surfeits, or in malignant diseases, which help to expel the poysonous humor, or corrupted humors in the body, or melt the Icy humors congeal'd by cold; but those sweats that are beneficial, and wholesome for the body, the body will be much stronger, and agiler, and the spirits quicker, and livelier,; but those sweats that are pernicious to the body, the body will be faint and weak, after they have sweat; but in these diseases, a physician must be very careful, when he puts a patient in a sweat, as to give such medicines as will work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48875:86"/>
that humor, he would have sweat forth, but in sweating di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases, as when the body sweats too violently, like as in great and dangerous fluxes, which are not to be staied by ordinary means, for although in these diseases, there must be used con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting medicines, yet some sweats require hot contracting medicines, others cold contracting medicines, and those medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines that are applied, must be applied gently, and by degrees, lest by a sudden contraction they should stop the pores of the body too much, which are the doors to let out the smoak in the body, as well as the sweat of the body, or by too hasty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions those passages should be shut, that should be kept open, or those to be kept opened that should be shut; but phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians will guess by the patient, what humor they sweat forth; for cold sweats are from melancholy, clammy sweats from thick flegm; hot burning sweat from choler; cold faint sweats proceed from the radical humor; hot faint sweats from the vital spirits.</p>

                  <p>All cold expulsions are, when the parts are tender, weak<note place="margin">There are hot expulsions, and cold ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsions, and hot contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and cold contractions.</note> and raw, and undigested; and hot expulsions are, when the parts are burnt, or ulcerated; for all hot expulsions work upon the parts of the body, as fire on wood when they are bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning expulsions, or else like as fire doth on metal, melting them into a liquid substance; and cold expulsions work upon the parts, as when cloudes beat down into showers of rain, or slakes of snow, breaking or extenuating those clouds into small parts, so that the dropsical humor that ariseth from hot consumptions, are onely liquid like melted metal; and the dropsical humor that ariseth from cold consumptions, is as a watery floud: but as I said, in all consumptions the remedies must be contractive, or at least retentive; because the nature of all consumptions are expulsive, but yet all or the most part of physicians, finding their patients to be lean and dry, give all dilative medicines, as if the parts were onely gathered into a less compass; but the truth is, when so much of the natural bulk of the body is lessened, so much of the body is wasted: I will not say but these unnatural expulsions might proceed from unnatural contractions, like as when any thing is made so dry as it moulders into dust, but when it comes to that degree, it expulses; so whensoever the body is in a consumption, the motions therein are expulsive: I do not mean by siege or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, although they will spit much, which is a kinde of vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but they waste by insensible inspirations; but all purging medicines are an enemy to this disease, unless they be very gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; for though purging medicines do not expulse, after the nature of consumptive expulsions, yet if they be strong, they
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48875:87"/>
may in some kinde assist the consumptive expulsions, neither is much leting blood good in these diseases; yet a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshes, and tempers the body; for in these diseases physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians must do as Chirurgions when they cure wounds, they first clense the sore or wounds, taking away the putrified matter gently with a probe, and then lay a healing plaister, so Physitians must gently purge and bleed the patient, and then give them strengthening, and nourishing remedies: again many Physitians have a rule, that when they perceive their patient to be exteriorly dry, that is, outwardly dry, they think them hot; but it doth not follow that all drouth proceeds from heat; for there are cold drouths as well as hot,<note place="margin">As witnesse the frost and ice.</note> so that a Physician must warily observe the patients drouth, whether it proceeds from cold or heat, or whether the drouth proceeds for want of a sufficient quantity of matter, for the body to feed upon, or that the matter, which properly should be porous and spungy, is contracted into an unnatural solidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and though the interior nature of drought is made by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, yet the exterior motions may be expulsive; as for example, if any thing is dryed to that degree as to fall into dust, although the interior be contracting, that caused it to be so dry, yet the exterior motions are expulsive, that causeth it to fall into parts; but the drouth of consumptions doth proceed most commonly from a scarcity of nourishing matter that should feed each part of the body, for the principal and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent parts being distempered, cannot disgest so much as will feed the hungry members therof; but as I have said before, that all consumptions are wrought by expulsive motions, for what is contracted, is not consumed, nor doth consume untill it expulses, but those bodies that are lean or dry by contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, are not in consumptions, for nothing is wasted, onely the dimensions, and extentions of the body are drawn into a lesser, compasse; Thus, as I have said, Physitians, although they mistake not the diseases, yet they may easily mistake the manner of the diseases, for one and the same kinde of diseases may move after divers manners in several bodies, and in one and the same body.</p>

                  <p>MOst dropsies are something of the nature of consumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as being in the way to consumptive expulsions, for they dilate after that manner, as the other expulses, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if they are dropsies, which proceed from corrupt parts, and then they turn to consumptive expulsions, and the onely difference in most dropsies, and consumptions, is, that dropsies as long as that disease lasts, the motions in the body are most dilating, which is in a degree to expulsion, and when it comes to a consumption they are all expulsions, but as the motions
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:48875:88"/>
differ, so the diseases differ, for there are several sorts of dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,<note place="margin">The like of other kinde of motions.</note> and several sorts of expulsions, nay some are different in the manner of working, as if they were of other kindes of motions, but some dropsies proceed from hot dilations, others from cold dilations, and some proceed from too many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestive motions, that is, when there are too many or too strong disgestive motions in the body; for the natural temper of the body disgests so fast, as makes more nourishment, then the several parts can feed with temperance, which makes the reignes, and the rest of the sucking parts glutinous, or else those many disgesting motions work too curious, for by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son they cannot be idle, they work the nourishing matter too fine, or too thin, for proper uses; as if flower should be so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten bolted, that it could not work into a lump, or batch for bread; or like as any thing should be wrought upon so much, as to become liquid, as into oyl or water.</p>
                  <p>Other dropsies proceed from the weaknesse of disgestion, those motions being not strong, or sufficient to work all that is brought into the stomach; whereupon that superfluous matter corrupts with distempered motions, and when it comes to be corrupted, it either dilates, or expulses, if it onely dilates, it turns to water, if expulsive, it casts forth, either by vomit or stool, or else lies to corrupt the principal parts in the body, which when they are joyned together, expulses life by their treacherous usurpation.</p>
                  <p>Other dropsies are caused by too weak contracting motions, causing that to be tender that should be solid, or those parts loose that should be firm, as not contracting hard enough. As first contracting into Chylus, then into blood, then harder, for flesh, and harder for nerves and bones; the contractions growing weaker and weaker, until they become of no strength, and then they turn to dilations or expulsions; but pray mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake me not, for though one and the same innate matter may grow weaker, as to abate of such or such a kinde of motion, so increases stronger and stronger, according to the quantity, as to other motions. But as I said before, that innated matter in such diseased bodies, turns from contracting to dilating, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by degrees from one to another, and then the dilations work more and more, extending more and more in such cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular motions as produce water; for when it comes to such a degree of extention, it is become from being solid to be lesse hard, from being lesse hard, to be soft, from soft to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid, from liquid fluid, and when it comes to such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of a fluid extention, it turns wet, and when it is soft, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid, fluid, and wet it is turned to that we call water; for oyl, though it be soft, liquid, and fluid, yet it is not absolute wet, it is rather moist then wet: for there is a difference between moist and wet, or glibby and wet, or glibby and moist, so that oyl is a glibby and moist body, rather then a soaking wet body;
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48875:88"/>
but when this watry extenuation extenuates beyond the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of water, they turn to vapour, which causeth the diseased to be puft or blown like a bladder, rather then swell'd out, as we shall perceive that a little time before the patients fall into a consumption, they will be so puft out, as their flesh wil be like a fire-bal, the next degree they fall into a fiery extenuation; For when the humour extenuates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond vapor, which is a kinde of an aire, then it becomes hot like fire, which is a hective fevour, and when the humour hath extenuated to the farthest degree, it expulses, and so pulls<note place="margin">See in the chap of exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations of water.</note> down and throws out the life of the diseased; but in the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dropical diseases, there must first be applied attractive medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines to draw out the watry overflows, by issues, cupping-glasses, or the like, then there must be applyed expulsive medicines as purgings, and bleeding, and sweatings, yet they must be gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applyed, for fear of weakning the body by drawing out the humour too suddenly, then there must be applied con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting medicines to draw into an united substance, as to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or draw up those parts that have been made loose, porous, and spungie with the disease, then there must be applied reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive medicines, to confirm and settle them, after their natural manner, or form, then last there must be applied disgestive me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines to restore what is wasted; but if any of the principal parts be impaired, wasted or expulsed: they neither can be restored nor mended, but by a new creation, which uncrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting braines perhaps conceive not; but I must intreat my readers to observe, that some sorts of motions begin a disease, that is, they lay the foundations thereof; and other sorts of motions work upon those foundations.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>SOme sorts of apoplexies are caused by an inbred super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous water, in the brain, which being congealed by a cold contraction, falling to the knitting part of the head, which is the hinder part, it stupifies the senses, stopping the natural motions as a flowing river, that is turned into ice; but those sorts of apoplexies are curable, if assistance be taken in time, which is by hot dilating medicines, not onely to stretch out the icy contraction, but to expell that cold watry humour by a rarification, but if the apoplexie be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by an inbred slime, as flegme, which is of a thicker nature then water, and is become crusted or petera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by hot contractions, it is seldom or never cured, no more then brick which is once baked by the sun, or in a fire, can be made to such clay as it was before it was burnt; But mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake me not, for I do not mean the humour is as hard as stone, or brick in the head, but so hard, as to the nature of the brain, that is, the flegme is grown so dry and tough, as not to be dissolved, so soon as the nature of the brain requires it,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48875:89"/>
for though flegme will be contracted into stone, as in the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and kidnies, yet not in the brain, by reason the nature of the brain is so tender, and so sensible, as it cannot indure so solid a substance therein, nor suffer so long a time as the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour will be penetrating to stop the passages to the brain, not but those kinde of motions that produce stone, may be so strong and so swift as to turn matter into stone immediately; but I do beleeve not in the animal bodies, for they are too weak figures for so strong motions to work in; but as I said these hot or cold contractions, for both sorts of contractions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce stone, so both sorts of contractions make tough, clammy, crusted, hard flegme, which is some degree towards stone, flegme if it stop the passages to the brain, it causeth an apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexie; but the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                     </gap> why the watry contractions are more apt for cure, is, because the nature of water is fluid, and is easily dissolved by dilations, having interior nature to extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but slime, and flegme are more solid, and so not so flexible, to be wrought upon, as suddenly to change shape, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in being dissolved or transformed.</p>
                  <p>The third cause is a fulnesse of blood, or a thicknesse of blood; for when the veins are too full, there is not vacuity e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for the blood to run, so stops the motion thereof, or if the blood is too thick, or clammy, it becoms lesse fluid, and the more solid it is, the slower the motion is, and though the blood may have too quick a motion by reason of heat, so it may have too slow a motion by reason of thicknesse, and if the veines are filled too full of hot blood, wherein are many spirits, it endangers the breaking some of the veines, like as when strong liquor is put into a barrel, if it be filled too ful the strength of the spirits striving for liberty, break the barrel; the like will the blood in the veins, and if a vein chance to break in the head, it overflows the brain and drowns the life therein.</p>
                  <p>The last is grosse vapor which may ascend from the bowels, or stomack, which causeth so great a smoak, as it suffocates, or choaks the brain, smothering out the life of the body.</p>
                  <p>All apoplexies are somewhat of the nature of dead palsies.</p>

runs about in cross motions, which cause pain; for the extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting motions thrusting outward and the resisting motions thrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing backward, run cross, or beat on each other, which causeth pain; and as long as the strife lasts, the body hath no ease, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til some assistance in medicines be given, or that it can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master the resistent motions; but when once it hath liberty, it flies out in expulsive motions, at all vents; but if the extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting humors are broke, or dissolved in the body, by the well tempered motion therein, or expulsing of its self, it evaporates through the pores of the body in insensible transpirations; but if the extenuating can finde no way to be expulsed, it gathers inward in small, and smaller rings, like a scrue drawing in the guts or stomach, therein stopping the passages thereof, whereby the body can neither receive nourishment, nor send out excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with which the body is brought to an utter destruction; but these kinds of windes causing this distember, this distemper is oft times produced from sharp, hot, cholerick humors; which sharpness hath a natural contracting quality which is rather of the nature of a cramp, or a convulsion, then the nature of a collick; howsoever expulsive medicines are good in these cases of diseases. Convulsions are collicks in the nerves, and cramps collicks in the veins; and as the collick in the stomach or guts proceeds sometimes from winde, and sometimes from crude bilious sharp humors, so doth this.</p>

trebles for the tenor, and bases, or too many tenors for the tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and bases, and too many bases for the tenors and trebles to make a harmony; So in the body there may be too much of one, or more kinde of motions for other kindes to make a harmony of health, as for proof; too many contracting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, make the body too dry, and contract diseases; as for example, instead of binding any thing, we should break it by pulling or drawing too hard together, or instead of joyning of parts, we should knock them so close as to rivet, or split them; or instead of gathering such a quantity of matter, or joyning such a number of parts, we should gather twice or thrice the quantity; or numbers of the like examples might be given; for all other kinde of motions, as dilating or expulsive, instead of throwing out the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </head>
                  <p>MOst purging drugs are of the nature of hot burning fire; for the inherent motions therein work according to the humour, or matter it meets with, some humor they melt, making it thin and fluid, although it be hard, tough or clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and as fire doth oare which is unmelted metal, makes it so fluid, as it will run through a gutter of earth like water; so do some drugs make some sorts of humour through the body, either upward or downward.</p>
                  <p>Again, some drugs will work upon some humours, as fire upon wood, dividing the humour into small parts, as ashes from wood, which naturally falls downward.</p>
                  <p>And some they will dissolve by mouldring, and crumbling, as fire doth stone, which runs forth like sand, which is stone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed bred in the body.</p>
                  <p>Some drugs rarifie the humors into wind, as fire will rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and evaporate water, which is set boyling theron.</p>
                  <p>Other drugs will at fire that distils out the moist, and watry substance, from that which is more grosse; but it is to be observed, that all purging drugs that work by vomit, are somewhat of the nature of that kinde of fire we call sulphur; or oyl that is melted, or fluid sulphur,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48875:93"/>
when these sorts of drugs are set on fire, as I may say, by the natural or distempered heat in the body, it flies out as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendingly, like AEtna; for it is of the nature of sulphur to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend<note place="margin">I have treated of the several sorts of fire.</note> as flame doth; and certainly al bodies have such motions naturally inherent in them, as make and produce such effects as fire doth on several sorts of humours, by which motions the body hath a natural cleansing faculty, which makes the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural purging quality: but when the motions are so violent, they oftentimes destroy the body with burning fevers, or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent fluxes, or the like; for the fire in the body, is like a fire in a chimnie, for when the chimny is clean, and the fire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to lie therein, it warms and comforts all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and is useful for many imployments for the necessaries of life; but if the chimny be foul, or the fire too big, or too much for the chimny, it sets all in a flame, consuming whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it incompasses, if it be not quenched out with cooling ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips, as with water, or by casting on rubbish, or grosse materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als to smother it out, as in great fluxes, they will not onely give restringent medicines, as having a natural restringent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, but thick meats, as thicked milk, or the like; but when the body is restringent, or hath taken restringent medicines, it is produced by drying motions, as contracting, or retentive motion, if they be hot, retentive, or contracting motions, they they harden and confirm the humours, as the heat of the sun, or the heat of the fire doth clay, which turns it to brick or tile, or those things we call earthen pots, and according as the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour is grosse or fine, the more britle or hard, or thick or heavie, or thinne or light; It is for some humor as Proselnye, or Chyney, others as the grosser earthen vessels; Again, some sorts of contracting, or retentive motions draw the humour, as when bacon, neats tongues, or the like, are dryed in a chimney, or oven, or the like; other sorts of hot contractions draw the humour, as the sun doth the earth, dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the watry spring therein; but if the restringencies either of the body, or of the medicines be caused by cold retentive or contracting motions, it dries the humors, as cold frost dries the earth, or bindes up the humors, as frost binds up the waters in icy fetters, or thickens the humors, as cold thickens the water, or vapor drawn from the earth into clouds of snow. But I am to advertise my readers, that all expulsive motions are not fiery expulsions; for there are infinite several wayes of expulsive motions, and dilations.</p>
                  <p>Secondly these fiery motions do not alwayes work expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively, but contractively, attractively, and retentively, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestively.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, all expulsive, dilative, disgestive, contractive, attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, retentive motions are not fiery, but there is such a kinde, or sort of contractions, attractions, retentions disgestions, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and expulsions, as belong to fire or heat, or as I may
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48875:93"/>
better say, produces heat or fire, and as I said there are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite several wayes of each kinde of motion; as for example, I will treat of one of them: a bee gather wax, a bird gather straws, and a man gathers sticks; the bees gather and carie the wax to the hive to make a comb, to lay, or hold and keep the honey; the bird gathers and carries the straw to build a nest to hatch her young ones in; the man gathers wood to mend his house, these all gather to one end, but yet several wayes; for the bees gather the wax, and carie it on their thighs, the bird gathers the straw, and carries it with their bill, the man gathers with his hands, but carries it several wayes, as on his head, or on his shoulders, or at his back, or in his armes, and milions of the like examples may be given upon each kinde or sort of motion, or moved matter.</p>
                  <p>Again, I must advertise my readers, that though I say there are fiery motions in drugs, and natural fiery motions in every animal creature, and so in many other figures; yet I mean not a bright shining fire, although some are of opinion, that in the heart is a thin flame, and when that is put out, or goeth out, the creature dies; but I mean not such a fire, for to my apprehension there are three sorts of fire to our perceivance, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there may be numberlesse sorts, yet all of one kinde: as for example, there are those creatures we call animals, though some are beasts, birds, fish, and men, but not onely so, for some are of one sort, and some of another; for a lennit is not a parot, nor a parot an owl; nor a horse a cow, nor a sheep a dog, nor a whale a herring, nor a herring a plaise, nor a plaise a lobster; nor a black-more is not a tauny-more, nor a Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian an Ethiopian, yet all are of animal kinde; so although there may be several sorts of fire, and so of the other elements, yet all are of the fiery kinde, or likewise the fiery motions make several figures, and several figures have several fiery motions, for every sort of animals have a several shape, and several mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions belonging to that shape; so in fiery figures, and fiery motions; but as I said before; there are three sorts of fire. The first is a bright-shining hot-burning fire, that is, when the interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, and exterior temperament of matter, and the interior and exterior figure, and the interior and exterior motions be all as one. The second is a hot-burning fire, but not a bright shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fire, such as Aqua-fortis, vitrals, and such sorts of the same nature which will burn as fire doth, but not thin as the other fire doth; for though they are both of an interior nature, yet not of an exterior, for the bright-shining fire is all composed of sharp points, as I may say, lines of points, but this vitral fire is as sharp edged lines, like a rasor, or knife, or the like, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">That is when it works, and converts a thinner sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to its own nature.</note> is there external motions alike; for bright-shining fire mounts upwards, when it is not supprest, or in a straight para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel line, for flame which is the liquid part of bright-shining fire, although it moves in several lines, as it ascends, yet the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48875:94"/>
lines they ascend in are a straight diameter line, but this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral fire descends as it were downward, or divides as streames of water do, that digs it self a passage through the earth, so this vitral cuts a passage, through what it works on, neither can this sort of fire work so variously, as bright-shining fire can, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son it hath not so many parts, for points will fall into more parts, and are more swift in motion, then the edged line; as for example, dust which is numerous little parts heapt together, will be more agile upon the least motion, although it be of a weighty nature, as of the nature of a stone.</p>
                  <p>The smal haires which be of a light, and weightlesse nature, but being not divided into so many parts, cannot move so nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as being united lines, but if you cut the hair into smal parts, it shall move with more restlesse motion, then the sand, by so much the more as the substance is lighter.</p>
                  <p>The third sort of fire is that which I call a cold dull fire, such as brimstone, or sulphur, mercury, salt, oyl, or the like, this sort in the interior nature is of the nature of bright-shining fire, both in the motions, and temperaments of matter, but not in the exterior, for it is composed of points, but those points<note place="margin">But bound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with straight smooth lines without as to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</note> are turned inward, as toward the Center: but assoon as it touches the bright-shining fire, it straight turns the points outward: for those points soon catch hold of those straight circumferent lines, and break them in sunder, which as soon as they are broke, the points are at liberty, and taking their freedom, they mount in a flame; but when those lines are not dissolved by fire, but crack, as we will snap<note place="margin">As a flint, hard suger, brimstone, or the like.</note> a string asunder, then they onely sparkle fire out, but not flame out; but mercury, or quick-silver, the interior is fire, but the exterior is water, for the exterior moves extenuating circles as water doth, and so much as to make it soft, and fluid, but not so much as to make it wet; for though it alwayes gathers into sphiratical figures, which shews that the exterior would run into wet, but that the interior hinder it, by drawing the circles inward, as cold doth water into hail-stones, but yet the interior wants the force to make it so hard and firm; but as I did advertise my Readers before, that all sorts of fire work ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the matter it meets with, yet none work so vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, as the bright-shining fire; which makes me think that drugs are more of the nature of bright-shining fire, then of the two other sorts, because they work in the body according to the humour it meets with, for if it meets wit watrish humors, it boyls it as water in a pot, which either boiles over the mouth of the stomack, or evaporates out in sweat, like dewes, or draws downward, like as in showers ofrain, it melts humors like metal, or turns humors like wood into ashes, or calcines the humor, where some part is fixed, other parts are volable; As for example, Rubarb hath a double faculty, some humors it expels out, others it bindes up; for Rubarb is both
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48875:94"/>
purging, and restringent, as it is to be observed in great fluxes; for what it doth not cast forth it confirms to a more solid substance, so as it doth expulse and contract at one time, as I may say, according as it findes the humour it works with; Again, some drugs move several expulsive wayes, as by vomit and stool, where the vomiting is produced with as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending expulsions, siege with descending expulsions, but that expulses descending are of the nature of vitral fire, all that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulses ascendingly, is of the nature of sulphurous fire; but the generality of drugs works like bright-shining fire, according to the nature of the matter, it meets with, as I have sormerly described.</p>

                  <p>AS I have said in my former chapter, that all medicinal drugs, or simples, especially those that purge, are of the nature of fire; for the motions therein most commonly work apart according to the humor it meets with, as fire doth, which in general is to move so and so <note n="*" place="margin">That which is most apt to</note>; yet the natural motions in drugs, and likewise in fire are expulsive, and all that is expulsive, is by antipathetical nature striving to destroy by uniting parts, and all contractive motions are by a sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical nature, striving to unite, by imbracing, or drawing parts together, yet the nature of the body they work in the contracting motions, may be antipathetical, and expulsive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be sympathetical, the one in expelling the superfluous and corrupted humors, the other in contracting them into a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, but most diseases are cured by contrary motions; for if they be diseases of expulsions, they must be cured by contracting, or retentive medicines; if they be diseases of contractions, they must be cured by expulsive medicines, or else dilating or attracting; for though the motions of attraction be agreeable, or of the nature of contraction, as to its self, as I may say, that is, to draw or carry, all to a center, as it were, but the onely diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is, that attraction make it self the center, drawing all things to it; but contractions make the matter they work on, part of the center with them, but all attractions are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuating motions, inviting, or drawing all towards it self, or like a man that should draw a dish of meat, or as if one should suck the brests or udder, but contracting motions are rather to binde, or knit up parts together, but if the diseases proceed from disuniting motions, then retentive medicines must be applied, which is to firm, hold, or settle parts that are loose, unsteddy; but if the diseases proceed out of disorder and irregularity, they must be cured by digestive medicines, which is to put every part in order, and in its proper place; like wise States-men that are neither partial or malicious, (but Readers know) that
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48875:95"/>
though I say all diseases must be cured by contrary motions, yet the motions that are in such medicines, must sympathize, and agree with the constitution of the body. Lastly, it is to be observed, that every degree in the disease must be followed with the same degree in the medicine, whether swift or slow, strong or weak, or more, or lesse, that is, you match your medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines to the disease; but mistake me not, I mean not after the literal sense, but after the metaphorical sense; but al purging me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines are dilative or expulsive, all restringent medicines, are<note place="margin">I mean pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning motions.</note> contractive, and retentive.</p>

                  <p>Some times the humours of the body, and the outward senses agree and disagree; sometimes the humours of the body, and the passions of the minde, agree, or disagree; sometimes the passions of the minde, and the outward sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses agree, or disagree, and sometimes the senses, and the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions disagree, or agree with the humors of the body.</p>
                  <p>As for example, sometimes the distempered humors in the body, make extravagancy in the senses, as we see in fevers; and sometimes the distempered humors of the body make a disordered minde, as we see those that have cholerick hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, cholerick passions; melancholy humours, melancholy pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and the like, or distempered humors, extravagant imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and the like.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes extravagant senses make extravagant fancies, sometimes a superabundant humor makes a strong particular appetite; as for example, those in the green sicknesse, the overflowing, or increase of some raw, and indigested humor will cause a strong particular appetite, as some in that disease love to smell strong smells, as camfier, tanned-leather, musty bottles, or the like, or to delight onely in one taste, as oate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal, coals, or several particular tasts, or extravagant tasts, not natural to the constitution of the body, as to delight to eat coals, leather, candles, cork, and milions of the like; and the humour increaseth, and is nourished by the sympathy of that extravagant diet; for what the senses take pleasure in, the minde longs for. Again, some humors Antipathize, as to hate all loathsome tasts, smells, noices, touches, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
                  <p>So passions sympathize with some humors, and disagree with others, for some bitter humors make cholerick passions, sharp humors make spiteful passions, tough humors make a dull un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, melancholy humors, make timerosity, cholerick humors make courage, and many the like; then the senses of the minde agree, and disagree often, as some objects will astonish the senses, and ravish the minde, delight the sense, and cause love in the minde; others which the sense dislike, causeth hate in the minde, pain in the sense, grieving in the minde, pleasure in the sense, delight in the minde; but if the sense and minde disagree, then the sense likes that the minde hates; As for example, the sense is taking pleasure upon an object, which for the crosse disposition, the minde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </head>
                  <p>INward commotions of the body are often times caused by outward objects, or subjects, as when the senses take ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light at some kinde of sound, scent, sight, taste, and touch; as for example, some will sownd at a fearful noise, that is, at a sudden, or unacustomed, or tumultuous noise; others will sownd at the sight of bloud, or at any cruel object, or at the sight of a cat, or many other creatures; some will sownd at sweet-smels; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers if they should taste cheese, or any meat they dissike natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and some will not onely sownd but die laughing with tickling, the reason is, that the exterior motion anticipates with the natural motions belonging to the body, sometimes onely to the sensitive parts, other-some to the rational part, others to both.</p>
                  <p>The reason is, that the disordered motions of the outward senses, disorder the interior motions, which makes the body sick, and the body passionate, and sometimes the brain fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, and if they make not the body sick, nor the brain mad; yet those antipathetical, and these disordered motions, never fail to put the sense to pain, or move passion; but when these anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathetical motions be toostrong for the natural motions belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the body, or minde, it brings death, or unrecoverable madnes, for then the natural motions belonging to that body, is as it were extinguished; thus we may see that the outward senses may be perfect, and the inward parts within that body may be corrupt and decayed; so likewise the outward senses may be defected, and the inward parts sound, and so some parts of the body firme, and others infirme, and some of the outward parts, or sense wanting, or defective, others free clear and distinguishing.</p>
                  <p>The reason is, that some of the sensitive innated matter works
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:48875:96"/>
orderly, others disorderly, and clear from the nature of the body; for as I have said before, some of the exterior parts of the body, may be nummed, or dead; the reason is that the natural motions, belonging to such a part of the body are altered, for every part or parcel, hath proper motions belonging there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
                  <p>But if in any part of the body, the natural motions onely work irregularly, then it onely causeth a pain in that part; but if the motions work crosse to the nature of the body, it causeth that part to die, but if they alter but in part, it causeth onely a numnesse which is in a degree of being dead, but if the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural motions be onely stopt by some outward accident, or actions, as by a sudden fright, which causeth the body to swoon by reason the spirits are contracted by the fright into so straight a compasse, and thronged so close together, that they cannot move in order, or by the action of lying, or pressing too hard, or too heavy upon any part that hinders the spirits therein from moving after their natural manner, which causeth a slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse or numnesse in those parts, that are prest by weight, or strength; those disorders are soon to be rectified. Again, as by giving liberty, or helping the spirits with cordials which gives strength to them, and sets them at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but if the sensitive parts be quite altered from their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural course, they seldom are rectified; But sometimes the assistance of the regular motions in the body, joyning as it were with one consent, do expel that innated matter out of that part wherein they work, contrary to the nature of the body, and supplies that part with fresh, and new matter, that moves as it should do.</p>
                  <p>Likewise as the sensitive innated matter works in some parts of the body irregularly, and in other parts regularly, and in one, and the same part, sometimes regularly, and sometimes irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly, the same is it many times with the rational innate mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for sometimes that will moves regularly, and sometimes iregularly, that makes frantick men, sometimes to be in their wits, and sometimes out of their wits: but if their madnesse be at certain times, as at full of the moon, or high tides, or springs, or falls, or in the midst of summer, or when they keep an evil, or too full a diet, then it proceeds from those out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward accidents, which give assistance to the disordered motions, which inhabit in the body, the original defect being amongst the sensitive innate matter, for this shewes that the madness proceeds from some distemper of the body, which most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly is in the spleen, or that which they call in women, the mother, from which parts arise grosse, and noisom vapors, which ascends up into the head, and disaffects the brain; and many times the brain is disaffected with its own distempers, and whensoever the brain is distempered, the rational innate matter which moves therein, moves irregularly; but when those times
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:48875:97"/>
or seasons are past, or that overfulnesse of humour is purged out, the natural motions of humour get strength, and the man is well untill the return thereof.</p>
                  <p>But if the irregularity be in the rational innate matter, it is most dangerous, for it seldom, or never is cured, nor seldom have intermitting fits, but as a continual fever, in the body, so is a continual madnesse in the minde.</p>

                  <p>THe bottome hole in the eare is covered with a thin caule, or felme, which is called the drum of the ear, where those motions that enter in at the ear beat thereon, like unto drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks, and if the felm, or thin skin, be stretched smooth, or braced straight with the nervous strings, the sound is clear and loud, but if it be weakly braced, and the nervous strings loose, and the thin skin slack, the sound is low and dull, by reason that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:48875:97"/>
skin is so soft by the slackness, that the beating, or striking, or playing motion thereon cannot rebound, or retort, but sinks, and is smothered therein; and if it be stretched very hard, and thin, and then such motions enter the ear, which pierce, or cut sharp, such as we call shrill notes, it doth not onely desturb the natural motion in the brain, but many times breaks that skin, or at least puts it to pain; likewise if those motions that enter in at the ear, move crosse to the natural motions in the brain, it causeth pain in the head; likewise if one and the same notes are often repeated, it fills the head so full of this particular motion, as they over-power the natural motions therein; and as I may<note place="margin">We may hear a tune so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeated; that it may grow hateful; although de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful at first.</note> say, cause a surfeit thereof in the brain, being glutted therewith, tiring not onely the sensitive part os the brain, which causeth pain or diseases, but oppresseth the rational part of innate mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the brain, causing a hate thereto; and if the vocal, or verbal sound are crossed, as by the way of antipathy, it may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order both the sensitive, and rational innated matter in the brain, so much by striking or pressing into, and by barring and throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, as the sense, and reason are so disordered, as the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral government is absolutely overthrown, from whence proceeds madness, at least extravagant passions raised from the heart; the like disorder both in the head, and heart, may proceed from each of the senses; and as this or the like external objects, or subjects may disorder by the irregular, and antipathetical motions the health and understanding, which are the interiour motions, so regularity and sympathie of the verbal or vocal motions brought through the ear, may compose the differences, and disorder of the natural interior motions, as health, reason, understanding, affection, or reconcilement; as for example, a timely, kinde, discreet discourse, may compose a disquiet mind, for the motions of wise, sober, kinde, gentle, or eloquent words may turn the motion of troubled &amp; combustible, or extravagant thoughts into a smooth, and calm temper, or regular order; Likewise un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, and indiscreet, double, false, malicious, hasty, sudden, sad, or frightful discourses, may discompose, and disorder a quiet and well tempered minde, disordering the regular motions, by misplacing the thoughts, making a war in the minde, giving strength to some thoughts, and overpowring others.</p>
                  <p>The like with vocal sounds; as for musick, the notes in musick agree with the motions of passions, and the motions of several thoughts, as some notes sympathize with passions, and with the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral thoughts, and move the actions accordingly, so others dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compose the minde, and inveterat and disturb it; for slow, sought strains on the tenor, and bass, is as commending, extorting, exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, threatning, terrifying, judging, which moves the minde to melancholy, from whence proceeds fear, superstition, devotion, repenting, praying, and vowing, which causeth an humble sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, dejected countenance, weeping eys, heaved up hands, and bended knees.</p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:48875:98"/>
                  <p>And slow soft notes, onely on the tenors, are a sad relation, sorrowful laments, mournful complaints, pleadings, petitioning, acknowledging faults, begging pardon, imploring mercy, which moves the minde to a tender pitty and compassion, and a chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table love, from whence proceeds a listning ear, a helping hand, a serious countenance, a sad eye, with a favouring cast therefrom.</p>
                  <p>High, hard, sharp, notes or straines, on the basse or tenor, is like exclaiming, incouraging, or animating, extolling, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing; which moves the minde to pride, ambition, vain-glory, desire, hope, which makes the body active, the actions adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, bold, the eyes darting and quick.</p>
                  <p>Low, sharp straines, and cross notes, and unequal times, move the minde to murmur words, choler, hate, revenge, fury, despair, the cursing, their hands tearing, the legs stamping, their bodies turning several wayes, their countenance maskerd and gastly, and the eyes staring.</p>
                  <p>But quick sharp straines in tenor notes, and soft slow strains on treble notes, are as perswading, flattering, insinuating, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing, inviting, alluring, this moves the minde to love, the thoughts to be amorous; this makes their actions affective, kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their hands, making of leggs, mending their garments, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering their service, their words complemental, their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance smiling, and their eyes glancing.</p>
                  <p>And quick sharp strains, on the tenor, and treble notes, produce a cheerful minde, it makes the thoughts lively, the countenance pleasant, their eyes quick, their discourse wanton, and jesting, their actions laughing, singing, playing, and dancing.</p>
                  <p>But slow low flats strike on the basses, and tenor notes moves the minde to a dull stupidity, wherein the thoughts lie as dead, this makes the body appear like sensless statues of stone, without motion, the head bending down, the eyes fixt to the ground.</p>
                  <p>But Cramatick musick is like Schools disputation, and discord in musick, is like quarrelling, these are the grounds of musical discourses, or discourses in musick.</p>
                  <p>Musick hath a sympathie to the rational motions, because the rational spirits move in number and measure, as musical instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do.</p>

                  <p>IT is not sufficient for Physitians to study the names of disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and to know onely so much, as to distinguish one kinde of disease from another, as we should distinguish man from beast, or so, as a horse from a cow, or as that horse is a barbe, or a coarser, or a genet, or a Turk, or an Arabian, but that this barbe, is not that barbe, or this genet is not that genet, and the like. Likewise to know the nature so, as to know how to use it, and what fit to apply to it; as for example, a man buyes a horse, and he having onely an old saddle, that he was accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ride with on a horse he formerly had, put it on his new horses back, yet although his horse is of the same Country, or sort of horses, as his former horse was, yet the saddle may not be fit for the new horse, but may be either too big or too little, and by the unfitnesse may gall his horse so sore, and corrupt the flesh so much, as he may be a scald back jade, as long as he lives, if it festers not as to kill him; so in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases medicines may be too strong, or too weak, or they may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuate too much or too little, if they do not not know the just dimension, and extention of the disease. Again, one the same sort of horses may be so dull, as hardly to move out of his pace with the spur, although it should prick so deep, as to make his sides to bleed, when another horse of the same sort, shall run away, over hedg, and ditch, against trees, and stones, untill he hurt himself, and flings his rider, or at least flings, and leaps, and snorts, and stamps; and grows into a furious heat; so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, some must be handled gently, others more roughly, for in diseases you must learn the disposition of the disease, as well of what kinde, sort, or breed it is; so likewise it is not enough for a physitian to know what drugs will purge choler, what flegme, and what melancholy, or the like; but they should study to know the several motions, which work in them, or else their operations will be as their imploiments are, which is chance-medly; for otherwise a Physitian neither applies his medicines knowingly, nor skilfully, but customarily, because they are usually given in such diseases, whereof some do mend, others do die with them; but certain if Physitians would take pains to study the several motions of the diseases, and also of the drugs, and medicines they give, and would do as skilful mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians, which make a consort, where although every one plaies
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:48875:99"/>
upon a several instrument, yet they all make their notes agree, there would follow a harmony of health in the body, as well as a harmony of musick in these consorts.</p>
                  <p>But as I said before it is not sufficient to know how to purg choler, flegme, melancholy, and the like, for the purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of those humors doth not alwayes work cures; for some diseases do not alwayes proceed so much from the loose hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in the body, as the disordered motions in the body; for choler, flegme, melancholy, are not superfluous humors of the body; unlesse the quantity of each be too much; for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the body, for those humours are part of the body, and the body could not subsist without them, for they are several mixtures, which serve to the consistance of the figure, and as some humours, make and mix such humours, so other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions carry the humour like tempered matter, or lime to the creations or reparations of the figure, which is the body; and if there were none of those humours, the figure would no more stand, if once a decaying, no more then a house which runs to ruine for want of stone, brick, wood, or morter, or the like: besides, if there were not flegme, choler, would do like a coach wheel, for want of moisture, the motions would set the body on fire, and if no choler, the flegme would drown it, and if neither flegme nor choler, muddy melancholy would dam, or stop it up.</p>
                  <p>But Physitians should study diseases so, as they may be able to distinguish them, as we do the different faces of mankinde, or any other; For there are as many several kindes of diseases, as there are animals, and as much difference in one, and the same kinde, as there are in the several shapes, and countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the body and nature, and disposition of the minde; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, diseases are like parents, and children, as the childe may resemble the parent, or the children of the same parents may resemble one another, and yet they are not all one; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, diseases may be like half brothers, or sisters, as some may have all one mother, but not one father; so some diseases may be produced, partly from such a cause, and partly from another. Again, diseases may be matcht, and some to be like widows, and widows that marry again, so diseases may be loose, or be quit of such a producing cause, and joyn with another.</p>
                  <p>As for example, a cold stomack is a disease, and a hot liver is a disease, and both may produce such diseases; perchance the cold stomack, may be cured, but not the hot liver, when the cold stomack is cured, the hot liver is a widow, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards may chance to match with a cold melancholy spleen, or two or thre, or more diseases, may be matched together; as if a man should have two or three wives, or a woman as many husbands; likewise several accidents may be matched, or at least commit adultery, and get bastardly children.</p>

with a sudden cold, which may produce a great fever or other diseases that usually follow, and milions of the like exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples may bee given. But I desire my Readers, that they may not condemn my comparisons, as extravagant, and too fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastical for so grave a subject, but I could finde no fitter to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse my meaning, which is onely that I would have Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians, as skilful, knowing and learned in diseases, as they are in the customs, manners, humours, and persons of men, and that they may as knowingly distiugnish the difference, alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, degrees, and alliances of diseases, as they do the several sexes, faces, countenance, dispositions and qualities of men.</p>
                  <p>Besides, who knowes but that the very thoughts of men may be known by the temper of their body? for could men come but to learn the several motions of the body, which ingenious observations may come to do, they may easily come to learn the motions of the minde, and so come to know the thoughts, which thoughts are the several figures therein, which figures most commonly move sympathetically, with the motions of the body.</p>

                  <p>ALthough infinite matter and motion was from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; yet that infinite moving matter is disposed by an in finite Deity, which hath power to order that moving mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as that Deity pleaseth, by reason there is nothing greater then it self, therefore there is nothing that can oppose its will.</p>
                  <p>Likewise this Deity is as the center of infinite moving mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for though there can be no center in infinites, by reason there is no circumference, yet in respect the matter is infinite every way from, and to this Deity; we may say the Deity is the center of infinite matter, and by reason, the infinite mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving matter, flowes as much to this diatical, center, as from it, it doth as it were present it self, or rather is forced to be ordered, by its infinite wisdom, which otherwise it would run into an infinite confusion, with which there would be an infinite, horrid and eternal war in nature; and though this Deity is as the center to infinite matter, yet this Deity in it self is as infinite matter, for its wisdom is as infinite as matter, and its knowledge as infinite as its wisdom, and its power as infinite as both, and the effects of these attributes run with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite matter, like infinite paralel lines, even and straight, not crossing, nor obstructing, nor can they circumference or circle in each other, the matter and the Deity being both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite neither is the matter or Deity finite to, or in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, for infinite matter hath no end, or period, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the infinite Deity comprehend it self, so as it is a god to it self, as well, or as much as to matter; for this Deity is no wayes finite, neither to its self, nor matter, its knowledge being as infinite as its power, and its wisdom as infinite its knowledge, and its power as infinit as both, and being infinit, its wisdom cannot be above its power, nor its power beyond its wisdom, neither can its knowledge compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend its power, or the wayes of its wisdom being all infinite and eternal.</p>
                  <p>And though nature is infinit matter, motion and figure crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all things out of its self, for of matter they are made, and by motion they are formed into several and particular figures, yet this Deity orders and disposes of all natures works.</p>

                     <l>As love doth raise up hope, so fear doth doubt,</l>
                     <l>which makes him seek to find the great God out:</l>

                     <l>But motion being slow, makes knowledge weak,</l>
                     <l>And then his thoughts 'gainst ignorance doth beat,</l>
                     <l>As fluid waters 'gainst hard rocks do flow,</l>

Also that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that make the humor, and the motions that move the humor may be quite different, and some parts of a humor may be made by some sorts of motions, and some by other sorts of motions, where my discourse of the motions which makes the Elements will enlighten the Readers.</p>
