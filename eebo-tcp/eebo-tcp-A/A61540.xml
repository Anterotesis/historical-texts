         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

effect of the Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
commonly used
towards the <hi>Candid
and Ingenuous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
unless it be in
diverting the censure
from the Book to the Preface:<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> yet in
some cases it looks like a breach of
the <hi>Readers</hi> priviledge,<note place="margin">The neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of writing in these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies.</note> not to give
him an account of the occasion and
design of a Book. Especially, when the
matter handled therein, hath been
thought so often discussed, and is of so
general concernment, that every pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender
thinks he knows as much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
as is to be known in it. But
we really find no greater advantage
<pb facs="tcp:45050:3"/>
hath been given to our Adversaries
than this, that the things in dispute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us are generally no better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
by the persons they have their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
upon. For assoon as <hi>they</hi> have
baffled their ignorance and mistakes,
<hi>these</hi> have been ready to yield up
themselves and the <hi>Cause,</hi> imagining
nothing more could be said for it, than
they could say for themselves. Whereby
our <hi>Church</hi> hath not only suffered in
its reputation, as far as that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in the weakness of some of its
members; but strange boasts and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
have been made by those of the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> when such who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
not their own <hi>Religion</hi> have
embraced theirs. While these disputes
were fresh in the world, every one
thought himself concerned to enquire
into them; but since our <hi>Church</hi> hath
been so long established on the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and other
unhappy controversies have risen up; the
most have taken this Cause for granted,
and thought it needless to enquire any
farther into the Grounds of it.</p>
            <p>Which our Adversaries perceiving,<note place="margin">§. 2.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:45050:3"/>
they have found far greater success in
their attempts upon particular persons,<note place="margin">The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent arts used by our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries to gain Proselyter.</note>
than in publick Writings: for these
have only provoked others to lay open
the palpable weakness of their Cause,
whereas in the other by their wayes of
Address, and all the arts of Insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they have instilled their principles
into the minds of some less judicious
persons before they were aware of it.
Thence it is easie to observe that the
greatest mischief they have done, hath
been like the <hi>Pestilence</hi> by <hi>walking
in darkness,</hi> and spreading their infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
by whispers in corners. All
their hopes and strength lye in the
weakness and credulity of the persons
they deal with; but if they meet with
any who truly understand the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
between us, they soon give them
over as untractable. But to such, whose
employments have not given them leave
to enquire or whose capacity hath not
been great enough to discern their <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistry;</hi>
their first work is, to make
a false representation both of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
and practices of their <hi>Church,</hi>
and if they be of such easie faith to
<pb facs="tcp:45050:4"/>
believe them, they from thence per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
them into an ill opinion of their
Teachers, who possessed them with so bad
thoughts of such a <hi>Church</hi> as theirs. A
<hi>Church</hi> of so great <hi>Holiness</hi> (as may be
seen by the Saint-like lives of their Popes
and Converts) a <hi>Church</hi> of so great
<hi>Antiquity</hi> (bating only the Primitive
times) a <hi>Church</hi> of so admirable <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
(saving the divisions in it) a
<hi>Church</hi> so free from any <hi>Fanatick</hi>
heats (as any one may believe that will.)
If this first assault doth not make them
yield; but they desire at least time to
consider and advise in a matter of so
great importance, then they tell them
there is not a man of our <hi>Church</hi> dares
give any of them a meeting; if they offer
to pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it to a tryal, they will appoint a day
which they foresee will be most incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for the persons they are to meet
with. If upon that account, it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
or deferred, this is spred abroad
for a <hi>Victory;</hi> if it be accepted, then
one thing or other happens that they
cannot come; either the person goes
out of Town unexpectedly, or his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours
have forbidden him; or such
<pb facs="tcp:45050:4"/>
conferences are not safe for them (they
are so sorely persecuted) or at last,
what good can an hours talk do to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
any one in matters of <hi>Religion?</hi>
But if there be no remedy, which they
are seldome without; and a conference
happen, (which they scarce ever yield
to, but when they are sure of the person
for whose sake it is;) then whosoever
was baffled, they are sure to go away
with the triumph; and as an evidence
of it, such a person went off from our
<hi>Church</hi> upon it, which was made sure
of their side before. If this way takes
not, then a sett of Questions is ready
to be sent; if another be returned to
them to be answered at the same time,
this is declined, and complained of as
hard dealing, as though they had only
the priviledge of putting Questions, and
we the duty of answering them. If an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
be given to them, after a Pass
or two they put an end to the tryal
of their skill in that place, and seek
for another to shew it in. But if the
Papers chance to be slighted, or business
hinders a present answer, or there be
a reasonable presumption, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb facs="tcp:45050:5"/>
concerned hath already forsaken
our <hi>Church,</hi> this becomes the occasion
of a new triumph, the Papers are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
unanswerable (as the <hi>Spanish
Armado</hi> was called <hi>invincible,</hi> which
we thank God we found to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise)
and it may be are demanded
again as <hi>Trophies</hi> to be preserved for
the glory of the <hi>Catholick Cause.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All these several wayes I have had
experience of in the compass of a few
years, since by command I was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
engaged in the Defence of so
excellent a <hi>Cause,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 3.</note> as that of our <hi>Church</hi>
against the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of this present writing.</note> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
it seemed somewhat hard to me, to
be put to answer so many several Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
which I have received upon their
tampering with particular persons of
our <hi>Church,</hi> while my Book it self re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
unanswered by them, after so
many years of trying their strength about
it. (For those two who in some small
measure have attempted it, have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
it in the way that Ratts an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
Books, by gnawing some of the
leaves of them; for the body and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of it remains wholly untouched by
<pb facs="tcp:45050:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them.) But for the satisfaction of any
person who desired it, I was not willing
to decline any service, which tended to
so good an end, as the preserving any
member of our <hi>Church</hi> in the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of it: Which was the occasion of
this present writing. For some time
since, the person concerned, after some
discourses with her, brought me the <hi>two
Questions</hi> mentioned in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Book; to which I return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a speedy answer in the midst of
many other employments; not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I received the Reply; but hearing
for a great while no further of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for whose sake this Discourse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
and having affairs more than
enough to take up my time, I laid aside
the Papers, supposing that business at
an end. But about <hi>Christmass</hi> last,
they were called for by a near Friend
of the party concerned, and a personal
Conference being declined, an intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was given me, that the Papers
were thought unanswerable. I began to
fear so too, for at first I could not
find them; but assoon as I did, I found
the great improvement they had made
<pb facs="tcp:45050:6"/>
by lying so long, for what at first I
looked on as inconsiderable, was in that
time thought to be too strong to be med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
with; and I could not tell what
they might come to in time, if I let them
alone any longer. And I was inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a worthy person that <hi>I. S. the
man of confidence and principles,</hi>
had expressed great wonder I had not
answered them; as though we had no
cause to wonder that <hi>the noble Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Controversie</hi> should be so
abandoned by him, and that a man of
such mettal should all this while leave
his poor <hi>demonstrations</hi> alone to
defend themselves? Vpon these sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
I resolved, as fast as other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
would give leave (for we
are not those happy men to have only
one thing to mind) to give a full and
punctual answer to them. Which I
have now made publick, and printed
the Papers themselves at large, that my
Adversary may not complain of any
injury done him by mis-representing
his words, or meaning. And besides
other reasons, I the rather chose to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in publick, to draw them from
<pb facs="tcp:45050:6"/>
their present way of <hi>pickeering</hi> and
lying under hedges, to take advantage
of some stragling members of our
<hi>Church,</hi> not so able to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and whom they rather steal from
us than conquer, being blinded with
their smoke, more than overcome by any
strength of argument. If they have
any thing to say, either against our
<hi>Church,</hi> or in Defence of their own,
let them come into the open <hi>Field,</hi> from
which they have of late so wisely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
themselves, finding so little suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
in it.</p>
            <p>And since these Disputes must be,<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> I
am very well pleased, that the Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
I have now to deal with,<note place="margin">Of the manner and design of the writing.</note> hath the
Character of a Learned and Ingenuous
man; and I do not desire he should lose
it in the Debate between us; hoping
that nothing shall proceed from me, but
what becomes a fair and ingenuous Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary.
If I were not fully satisfied
that we have truth and reason on our
side, I should never have been engaged
in these combats; I am so great a friend
to the peace of the <hi>Christian</hi> world,
that I could take more pleasure in end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:45050:7"/>
one Controversie, than in being able
to handle as many as the most Volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
<hi>Schoolmen</hi> have ever done: For
however <hi>Noble</hi> some may think, <hi>the
Science of Controversie</hi> to be, I am
not fond of the <hi>practice</hi> of it, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
being managed with so much heat
and passion, such scorn and contempt of
Adversaries, so many reproaches and
personal reflections, (as they commonly
are) as if men forgot to be <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
when they began to be Disputants.
I do not think it such a mighty matter
to throw dirt in a mans face, and then
to laugh at him, or (rather to take a
Metaphor now from dry weather) to
raise such a dust as may endanger the
eye-sight of weaker persons. I think it
no great skill to make things appear ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ridiculous or dark, but to give
them their due Colours, and set them in
the clearest light shewes far more art and
ingenuity. And even that smartness of
expression, without which Controversie
will hardly go down with many, seems
but like the throwing Vinegar upon hot
Coals, which gives a quick scent for the
present, but vanishes immediately into
<pb facs="tcp:45050:7"/>
smoke and air. In matters of Truth
and Religion, reason and evidence
ought to sway men, and not passion and
noise; and though men cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
their judgements, they may and
ought to do their expressions. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
this looks as like an Apologie
for a dull Book as may be, yet I had
much rather it should suffer for want
of wit and smartness, than of good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and <hi>Christianity.</hi> My design is
to represent the matters in difference
between us truly, to report faithfully,
and to argue closely; and by these to
shew, that no person can have any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of reason to leave our <hi>Church,</hi> to
embrace the communion of the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>Rome;</hi> because the danger is so
much greater there in the <hi>nature</hi>
of their <hi>Worship</hi> and <hi>tendency</hi> of
their <hi>doctrine;</hi> and what they object
most against us in point of <hi>Fanaticism</hi>
and <hi>divisions,</hi> will equally hold against
them; so that they have no advantages
above us, but have many apparent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers

            <p>Among the chiefest dangers in the
communion of that <hi>Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 5.</note> I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
<pb facs="tcp:45050:8"/>
on that of <hi>Idolatry;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Of the charge of Idolatry against the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> not to make
the breach wider than some others have
done, but to let persons first understand
the greatness of the danger before they
run into it. I wish I could acquit them
from so heavy a charge, but I cannot
force my judgement: and while I think
them guilty, it would be unfaithfulness
in me, not to warn those of it, whom
it most concerns to understand it. And
where other things are subtle and nice,
tedious and obscure, this lyes plain to
the conscience of every man; if the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> be guilty of <hi>Idolatry,</hi>
our separation can be no <hi>Schism</hi> either
<hi>before God</hi> or <hi>man,</hi> because our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
would be a sin. And although
it may be only an excess of charity in
some few learned persons, to excuse that
<hi>Church</hi> from <hi>Idolatry,</hi> (although not
<hi>all</hi> who live in the communion of it:)
yet upon the greatest search I can make,
I think there is more of charity than
judgement in so doing. For the proof
of it, I must refer the Reader to the
following Discourse, but that I may not
be thought in so severe a censure, to
contradict the sense of our <hi>Church,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:45050:8"/>
(which I have so great a regard to)
I shall here shew, that this charge of
<hi>Idolatry</hi> hath been managed against the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> by the greatest and
most learned defenders of it ever since
the <hi>Reformation.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>What greater discovery can be made

Papists, and the intent of it as any
man doth, neither do I go about to
excuse them from wicked, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

<hi>saith he,</hi> three kinds of Idolatry, one
is, when the true God is worshipped
by other means and wayes, than he
hath prescribed, or would be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped,
<hi>i. e. against his express com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
which is certainly his meaning:</hi>
the other is, when the true God is
worshipped with false Gods: the
third is, when we worship false Gods
either in heart, mind, or in external
creatures living or dead, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
forget the worship of the
true God. All these three kinds
are detestable, but the first is the
least and the last is the worst. The
Papists worship God otherwise than
his will is, and otherwise than he
hath prescribed, almost in all points
of their worship, they also give to
the creature, that which is due to
<pb facs="tcp:45050:10"/>
the Creator, and sin against the first
Table; yet are they not for all that
I can see or learn in the third kind
of Idolatry, and therefore if they
repent unfeignedly, they are not to
be cast either out of the Church, or
out of the Ministry. The Papists
have little cause to thank me, or fee
me, for any thing I have spoken in
their behalf as yet, you see that I
place them among wicked and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable

               <item>THE introduction, concerning the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of the debate. The Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> makes its members guilty
of Hypocrisie or Idolatry: First, Of
the Worship of God by Images: Some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
for clearing the notion of Divine
Worship. It is in Gods power to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the way of his Worship, which
being determined, Gods Law, and not our
intention, is to be the rule of Worship. The
main question is, Whether God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
the worshipping of himself by an
Image, under the notion of Idolatry? Of
the meaning of the second Commandment,
<pb facs="tcp:45050:15"/>
from the <hi>terms</hi> therein used, the large sense
and importance of them, which cannot be
understood only of Heathen Idols. Of the
reason of that Law, from Gods infinite
and invisible nature: How far that hath
been acknowledged by Heathens? The Law
against Image Worship no ceremonial Law
respecting meerly the Iews; the reason
against it made more clear by the Gospel:
The wiser Heathen did not worship their
Images as Gods, yet their worship con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
as Idolatry. The Christian Church
believed the reason of this Law to be immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table;

Of their Idolatry in Adoration of the
Host and Invocation of Saints.</head>
               <item>The Argument proposed concerning the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Host; the insufficiency of the
Answer to it manifested: supposing equal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
for Transubstantiation as for Christs
Divinity, yet not the same reason for Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
the Host as the person of Christ;
the great disparity between these two at
large discovered; the Controversie truly
stated concerning Adoration of the Host:
and it is proved, that no man on the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of the Roman Church can be secure
he doth not commit Idolatry in it. The
confession of our Adversaries, that the same
Principles will justifie the Worship of any
Creature. No such motives to believe
Transubstantiation as the Divinity of
Christ. Bishop <hi>Taylor</hi>'s Testimony an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
by himself. To Worship Christ in
the Sun as lawful as to Worship him in the
Host. The grossest Idolatry excusable on the
same grounds. The argument proposed
and vindicated concerning the Invocation
of Saints practised in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
The Fathers Arguments against the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
hold against Invocation of Saints;
<pb facs="tcp:45050:16"/>
the state of the Controversie about Idolatry
as managed by them. They make it wholly
unlawful to give divine Worship to any
Creature how excellent soever. The Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
not only of Heathen Gods, but of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
condemned. The common evasions an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.
Prayer more proper to God than Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.
No such disparity as is pretended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the manner of Invocating Saints and
the Heathens Invocating their Deities. In
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they do more than
pray to Saints to pray for them, proved from
the present most Authentick Breviaries. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
that were all, it would not excuse them.

Of the hindrance of a good Life and
Devotion in the Roman Church.</head>
               <item>The doctrines of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church prejudicial
to Piety. The Sacrament of Pennance, as
taught among them, destroyes the necessity
of a good life. The doctrine of Purgatory
takes away the care of it, as appears by the
true stating it, and comparing that doctrine
with Protestants. How easie it is, according
<pb facs="tcp:45050:16"/>
to them, for a rich man to enter into the
Kingdom of Heaven. Purgatory dreadful to
none but poor and friendless. Sincerity of
devotion hindred by prayers in an unknown
Tongue. The great absurdity of it manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted.
The effects of our Ancestors devotion
had been as great, if they had said their
prayers in English. The language of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
proved to be no indifferent thing, from
<hi>St. Pauls</hi> arguments. No universal consent
for prayers in an unknown tongue, by the
confession of their own Writers. Of their
doctrine of the efficacy of Sacraments, that
it takes away all necessity of devotion in the
minds of the receivers. This complained of by
<hi>Cassander</hi> and <hi>Arnaud,</hi> but proved against
them to be the doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church, by the Canons of the Council of
<hi>Trent.</hi> The great easiness of getting Grace
by their Sacraments. Of their discouraging
the reading the Scriptures. A standing Rule
of devotion necessary. None so fit to give it,
as God himself: This done by him in the
Scriptures. All persons therefore concerned to
read them. The arguments against reading
the Scriptures, would have held against the
publishing them in a language known to the
pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ple. The dangers as great then, as ever
have been since. The greatest prudence of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church is wholly to forbid the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures;
being acknowledged by their wisest
men, to be so contrary to their Interest. The
<pb facs="tcp:45050:17"/>
confession of the Cardinals at <hi>Bononia</hi> to
that purpose. The avowed practice of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church herein directly contrary to
that of the Primitive: although the reasons
were as great then from the danger of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies.
This confessed by their own Writers.

Fanaticisms to us as the effects of reading

and Revelations. Festivals appointed
upon the credit of Revelations: the Feast of

An Answer to the Remainder of

               <item>The mis-interpreting Scripture doth not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
its being a rule of faith. Of the
superstitious observations of the Roman
Church. Of Indulgences; the practice of
them in what time begun, on what occasion,
and in what terms granted. Of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences
in Iubilees, in the Churches
at <hi>Rome,</hi> and upon saying some Prayers.
Instances of them produced. What opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
hath been had of Indulgences in
the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> some confess they
have no foundation in Scripture, or Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
others that they are pious frauds:
the miserable shifts the defenders of indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
<pb facs="tcp:45050:20"/>
were put to: plain evidences of their
fraud from the Disputes of the Schools
about them. The treasure of the Church
invented by <hi>Aquinas</hi> and on what occasion.
The wickedness of men increased by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences</hi>
acknowledged by their own
Writers: and therefore condemned by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of that Church. Of <hi>Bellarmins</hi> pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Christians opinion of them. Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
no meer relaxations of Canonical
Penance. The great absurdity of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Churches Treasure on which
Indulgences are founded, at large mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested.
The tendency of them to destroy
devotion proved by experience, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Doctrine. Of Communion in
one kind; no devotion in opposing an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of Christ. Of the Popes power
of dispensing contrary to the Law of God
in Oaths and Marriages. The ill conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of asserting Marriage in a Priest
to be worse than Fornication, as it is in
the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Of the uncertainty
of faith therein. How far revelation to
be believed against sense. The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to prove the uncertainty of their
faith defended. The case of a revolter and
a bred Papist compared as to salvation:
and the greater danger of one than the other
proved. The motives of the Roman Church
considered; those laid down by <hi>Bishop
Taylor</hi> fully answered by himself. An
<pb facs="tcp:45050:21"/>
account of the faith of Protestants laid
down in the way of Principles: wherein
the grounds and nature of our certainty of
faith are cleared. And from the whole
concluded, that there can be no reasonable
cause to forsake the communion of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> and to embrace that
of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> p. 476</item>

               <p>The first <hi>Question</hi> being supposed to be
put concerning a <hi>Protestant</hi> yet continuing
so, doth imply a contradiction, <hi>viz.</hi> That
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45050:22"/>
a <hi>Protestant</hi> continuing so, should have the
same Motives to become a <hi>Catholick</hi> (take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that term here, only as signifying, one
of the communion of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome)</hi>
which those have, who have been born or
bred in that communion. But supposing
the meaning of the Question to be this,
Whether a <hi>Protestant</hi> leaving the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our <hi>Church,</hi> upon the Motives used
by those of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> may not be
equally saved with those who are bred in
it? I answer,</p>
               <p>1. That an equal capacity of salvation of
those persons being supposed, can be no
argument to leave the communion of a
Church wherein salvation of a person may
be much more safe, than of either of them.
No more, than it is, for a man to leap from
the plain ground into a Ship, that is in
danger of being wrackt, because he may
equally hope to be saved with those who
are in it. Nay, supposing an equal capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of salvation in two several <hi>Churches,</hi>
there can be no reason to forsake the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the one for the other. So that to
perswade any one to leave our <hi>Church</hi> to
embrace that of <hi>Rome,</hi> it is by no means
sufficient to ask whether such a one may
not as well be saved as they that are in it
already: but it is necessary, that they
prove, that it is of necessity to salvation
to leave our Church, and become a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45050:22"/>
of theirs: And when they do this, I
intend to be one of their number.</p>
               <p>2. We assert, that all those who are in
the communion of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> do
run so great a hazard of their salvation,
that none who have a care of their souls,
ought to embrace it, or continue in it.
And that upon these grounds.</p>
               <p>1. Because they must by the terms of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with that Church, be guilty either of
Hypocrisie or Idolatry, <hi>either of which are
sins inconsistent with salvation; Which I
thus prove.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That <hi>Church</hi> which requires the giving
the <hi>Creature</hi> the Worship due only to the
<hi>Creator,</hi> makes the members of it guilty of
hypocrisie or Idolatry; for it they do it,
they are guilty of the latter, if they do it
not, of the former; but the <hi>Church of</hi>
Rome <hi>in the Worship of God by Images, the
Adoration of the Bread in the Eucharist, and
the formal Invocation of Saints,</hi> doth require
the giving to the creature the Worship due
only to the Creator; therefore it makes
the members of it guilty of hypocrisie or
Idolatry.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> in these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
doth require the giving the creature
the honour due only to <hi>God;</hi> I prove thus
concerning each of them.</p>
               <p>1. Where the Worship of <hi>God</hi> is termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
upon a creature there, by their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45050:23"/>
the Worship due only to <hi>God</hi> is
given to the creature; but <hi>in the Worship
of God by Images,</hi> the Worship due to God
is terminated wholly on the creature;
which is thus proved; the Worship which
<hi>God</hi> himself denyes to receive, must be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
on the creature: but God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the <hi>second Commandment</hi> not only
denyes to receive it, but threatens severely
to punish them that give it. Therefore it
cannot be terminated on <hi>God,</hi> but only on
the Image.</p>
               <p>2. The same argument which would
make the grossest Heathen Idolatry lawful,
cannot excuse any act from <hi>Idolatry,</hi> but the
same argument, whereby the <hi>Papists</hi> make
the Worship of the Bread in the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist</hi>
not to be Idolatry, would make the
grossest Heathen <hi>Idolatry</hi> not to be so.
For if it be not therefore <hi>Idolatry;</hi> because
they suppose the bread to be <hi>God,</hi> then the
Worship of the Sun was not <hi>Idolatry</hi> by
them who supposed the Sun to be <hi>God;</hi> and
upon this ground, the grosser the <hi>Idolatry</hi>
was, the less it was <hi>Idolatry:</hi> for the grossest
<hi>Idolaters</hi> were those, who supposed their
Statues to be <hi>Gods.</hi> And upon this ground
their Worship was more lawful, than of
those who supposed them not to be so.</p>
               <p>3. If the supposition of a middle excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>us,</hi> be a sufficient
ground for <hi>formal Invocation,</hi> then the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45050:23"/>
Heathen Worship of their inferiour <hi>Deities</hi>
could be no <hi>Idolatry:</hi> for the Heathens still
pretended, that they did not give to them
the Worship proper to the Supream God;
which is as much as is pretended by the
devoutest <hi>Papist,</hi> in justification of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
of Saints.</hi> To these I expect a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
and punctual answer, professing as
much Charity towards them, as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with Scripture and Reason.</p>
               <p>2. Because the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is guilty
of so great corruption of the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
by such opinions and practices which are
very apt to hinder a good life: <hi>Such are,</hi>
the <hi>destroying the necessity of a good life,</hi> by
making the Sacrament of Penance joyned with
contrition, sufficient for salvation; <hi>the taking
off the care of it,</hi> by supposing an expiation
of sin (by the prayers of the living) after
death; <hi>and the sincerity of devotion is much
obstructed in it,</hi> by prayers in a language
which many understand not, by making the
efficacy of Sacraments depend upon the bare
administration, whether our minds be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for them or not; by discouraging the
reading the Scripture, which is our most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
rule of faith and life, by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of superstitious observations never used
in the Primitive Church, as we are ready to
defend; by the gross abuse of people in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons
and Indulgences, by denying the Cup to
the Laity, contrary to the practice of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45050:24"/>
Church in the solemn Celebration of the
Eucharist for a thousand years after Christ;
by making it in the power of any person to
dispense contrary to the Law of God, in Oathes
and Marriages; by making disobedience to
the Church in disputable matters, more hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,
than disobedience to the Laws of
Christ in unquestionable things, as Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
in a Priest, to be a greater crime, than
Fornication.</p>
               <p>By all which practices and opinions
we assert, that there are so many hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
to a good life, that none who have
a care of their salvation, can venture their
souls, in the communion of such a <hi>Church,</hi>
which either enjoyns or publickly allows
them.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Because it exposeth the faith of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
to so great uncertainty:</hi> By <hi>making the
authority of the Scriptures to depend on the
infallibility of the Church, when the Churches
Infallibility must be proved by the Scripture:</hi>
by <hi>making those things necessary to be believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which if they be believed overthrow all
foundations of faith, viz.</hi> That we are not
to believe our senses in the plainest ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of them, as that bread which we
see is not bread; upon which it follows,
that tradition being a continued kind of
sensation, can be no more certain, than
sense it self; and that the Apostles might
have been deceived in the body of <hi>Christ</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:45050:24"/>
after the resurrection; and the <hi>Church</hi> of
any Age in what they saw or heard. By
<hi>denying to men the use of their judgement
and reason as to the matters of faith proposed
by a Church,</hi> when they must use it in the
choice of a <hi>Church;</hi> by <hi>making the Churches
power extend to make new Articles of faith,
viz.</hi> by making those things necessary to
be believed, which were not so before.
By <hi>pretending to infallibility in determining
Controversies, and yet not determining Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
which are on foot among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi>
All which, and several other things
which my designed brevity will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
me to mention; tend very much to
shake the faith of such, who have nothing
else to rely on, but the authority of the
<hi>Church of Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. I answer, <hi>That a Protestant leaving the
Communion of our Church, doth incurr a
greater guilt, than one who was bred up in
the communion of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and
continues therein by invincible ignorance,</hi>
and therefore cannot equally be saved with
such a one. For a <hi>Protestant</hi> is supposed,
to have sufficient convictions of the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> or is guilty of
wilful ignorance, if he hath not; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
we know not what allowances
God will make for invincible ignorance, we
are sure that wilful ignorance, or choosing
a worse Church before a better, is a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45050:25"/>
sin, and unrepented of destroyes sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>To the second <hi>Question</hi> I answer, 1. I do
not understand what is meant by a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
in the Abstract, or in the whole lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi>
it being a thing I never heard or
read of before; and therefore may have
some meaning in it, which I cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.
2. But if the Question be as the
last words imply it, Whether a <hi>Christian</hi>
by vertue of his being so, be bound to
joyn in some <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Congregation</hi> of
<hi>Christians?</hi> I answer affirmatively, and that
he is bound to choose the communion of
the purest <hi>Church,</hi> and not to leave that
for a corrupt one, though called never so
<hi>Catholick.</hi>

            <p>I Did not expect that two bare Questions
could have produced such a super-foetati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Controversies, as the Paper you sent me
is fraught with; But since the Answerer
hath been pleased to take this Method, (for
what end himself best knows) I shall not
refuse to give a fair and plain return, to
the several points he insists upon, and that
with as much brevity as the matter and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
will bear.</p>
            <p>The Questions proposed were: 1. Whether
a Protestant having the same Motives to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Catholick, which one bred and born,
and well grounded in Catholick Religion hath
to remain in it, may not equally be saved in
the profession of it?</p>
            <p>The 2. Whether it be sufficient to be a
Christian in the abstract, or in the whole la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude;
or there be a necessity of being a
member of some distinct Church or Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Christians?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:45050:26"/>
               <hi>The first</hi> he saith, <hi>being supposed to be
put concerning a Protestant continuing so,
implyes a contradiction;</hi> but where it lyes I
cannot see, for a Protestant may have the
same Motives, and yet out of wilfulness or
passion not acquiesce to them. He saw no
doubt this supposition to be impertinent to the
Question, and therefore in the second part of
the 1. §. states it thus: <hi>Whether a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
leaving the communion of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Church, upon the motives used by
those of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, may not be
equally saved with those who were bred
in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Question thus stated in its true sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
he answers first, §. 2. <hi>That an equal
capacity of salvation of those persons being
supposed, can be no argument to leave the
Communion of a Church, wherein the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of a person may be much more safe
than either of them.</hi> But before I reply, I
must do both him and my self right in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of fact; and it is, <hi>Madam,</hi> that when
you first addressed to me, you professed your
self much troubled, that he had told you, a
person leaving the Protestant communion, and
embracing the Catholick, could not be saved.
That we should deny salvation to any out of the
Catholick Church, you lookt upon as uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable,
and this assertion of his had startled
you in the opinion you had before of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Charity. Whereupon you desired to know
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45050:26"/>
my opinion in the case, and I told you I saw
no reason, why the same Motives which se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
one born and bred, and well grounded
in Catholick Religion, to continue in it, were
not sufficient also to secure a Protestant, who
convinced by them, should embrace it. This
<hi>Madam,</hi> your self can witness, was the true
occasion of your proposing the Question, and
not as the Answerer supposes, that I used
the meer Question it self as a sufficient Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to perswade you to embrace the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Communion. This premised, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
that the Answer he gives, is altogether
forrain to the matter in hand, the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
not being between a Bred and a Converted
Catholick on the one side, and a person sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be in a safer Church than either of
them on the other: nor yet between two se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Churches supposed to have in them an
equal Capacity of salvation, but between a
person bred in the Catholick Religion on the
one side, and another converted to it from Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantism
on the other, whether the latter may
not be equally saved with the former? Nor
is it to the purpose of the present Question, to
prove <hi>that it is of necessity to Salvation to
leave the Protestant Church, and become a
member of the Catholick,</hi> because the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is only of the possibility, not of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of Salvation. I say it is not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the present Question to prove this, but
rather belongs to the second, where I shall
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45050:27"/>
speak to it. Whether there be a necessity of
being a member of some distinct Church?
Which being resolved affirmatively by both
parts, it follows then in order to enquire which
this true Church is. As for the Example of
<hi>a man leaping from the plain, ground into
a Ship that is in danger of being Wrackt,</hi>
meaning by that Ship (as I suppose he does)
the Catholick Church. Some will be apt to
think he had come nearer the Mark if he had
compared the Protestant to a Ship, which by
often knocking against the Rock on which
the Catholick Church is built, had split it
self into innumerable Sects, and was now
in danger of sinking: his comparison was
grounded only on his own supposition, but this
is grounded on the truth it self of too sad an
experience. But to leave words, and come to
the matter. His second Answer is, §. 3. that
<hi>all those who are in the communion of the
Church of</hi> Rome <hi>do run so great a hazard
of their Salvation, that none who have a
care of their souls ought to embrace or
continue in it.</hi> The first answer as I have
shewed, was nothing pertinent to the present
Question, nor comes this second any nearer
the matter, for though it be supposed, that
none ought to embrace or continue in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church by reason of the great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,
he saith, they run of their salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet if they do embrace or continue in
it, why may they not be equally saved, that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45050:27"/>
is, with equal capacity; but this assertion,
however beside the Question, he makes it his
main business to prove, First, §. 4. <hi>Because
those who embrace or continue in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church are guilty either of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie
or Idolatry, either of which are sins
inconsistent with salvation.</hi> And here he
must give me leave to return upon him a more
palpable contradiction, than that he supposed
to have found in the Question, <hi>viz.</hi> to assert
only, that those of the Catholick Communion
run a great hazard of their salvation, and yet
affirm at the same time that they are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
either of Hypocrisie or Idolatry, sins incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with Salvation: which reduced into plain
terms, is no other but that they may be
saved, though hardly, and yet cannot be
saved. But to the Argument, <hi>The Church of</hi>
Rome, <hi>by the Worship of God by Images,
by the adoration of Bread in the Eucharist,
and the formal invocation of Saints, doth
require the giving to the Creature the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
due only to the Creator; Therefore it
makes the members of it guilty of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie
or Idolatry.</hi> The charge is great, but
what are the proofs?</p>
            <p>Concerning the first he saith, §. 5. that <hi>in
the Worship of God by Images, the Worship
due to God is terminated wholly on the
Creature.</hi> And surely this implies another
contradiction, that it should be the Worship
of God by Images, and yet be terminated
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45050:28"/>
wholly on the Creature; Nevertheless he proves
it thus; <hi>The Worship which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
denyes to receive, must be termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
upon the Creature; but God himself
in the second Commandment, not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes
to receive it, but threatens severely to
punish them that give it,</hi> that is, that Worship
him by an Image. <hi>Therefore it cannot be
terminated on God, but only on the Image.</hi>
To this Argument, which to be just to the
Author, I confess I have not seen any where
proposed in these terms, I answer, the first
Proposition is built on a great mistake of the
Nature of humane acts, which though they
ought to be governed by the Law of God, yet
when they swerve from it, cease not to tend to
their own proper objects. Gods prohibition of
such or such a kind of Worship, may make it
to be unlawful, but hinders not the act from
tending, whither it is intended; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
if it be intended or directed by the
understanding to God, though after an unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
manner, it will not fail to be terminated
upon God: Thus when a Thief or a Murderer
prayes to God to give him good success in the
Theft or Murder he intends, though God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes
to hear any such Prayer, yet is the Prayer
truly directed to him: and thus when the Iews
offered to God in Sacrifice the blind and the
lame, though he had forbidden it, yet was the
oblation terminated on him, and therefore he
reproves them for having polluted him, <hi>Mal.</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:45050:28"/>
1. 8. and to convince them the more of their
evil doings: offer it now, sayes he, to thy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
will he be pleased with thee, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
thy person? Though the Governour deny
to accept what is presented to him, yet it is
truly offered to him by the presenter; and so,
although God deny to accept such or such Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
yet it is truly offered to him, though
the offering of it after a forbidden manner
make it to be sin: Did not God refuse to accept
the Sacrifice of <hi>Cain,</hi> and yet the Scripture,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 3. sayes expresly, that he brought an
offering to the Lord? God had not respect to
<hi>Cain</hi> nor his offering, but this did not hinder,
but that <hi>Cains</hi> offering had respect to God,
and was terminated on him. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
though God deny such or such a kind of
Worship; if it be offered though unlawfully
by the Creature, yet is it terminated on him.
The Proposition therefore which asserts, <hi>that
the Worship which God denyes must be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
on the Creature,</hi> I deny as absolutely
false, and so will you too, <hi>Madam,</hi> when you
shall see the sense of it to be no other, but that
a wicked man cannot Pray to God, or Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him in an unlawful or forbidden man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
who is therefore a wicked man because
he does so. What follows from hence is, that
though God should have forbidden men to
Worship him by Images, yet it does not
follow but the Worship so given, would
be terminated on him. But now to speak
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45050:29"/>
to his second Proposition in which the main
force of this Argument consists.</p>
            <p>We utterly deny that God in the second
Commandment, forbids himself to be Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
by a Crucifix, for example, or such
like Sacred Image; for such only are the
subject of the present Controversie. What he
forbids there, is to give his Worship to
Idols: and this is clear from the Circumstances
of the Text: First, Because this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if St. <hi>Austins</hi> Iudgement be to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
is but a part or Explication of the
first, Thou shalt have no other Gods before
me: Secondly, because the Hebrew word
<hi>Pesel,</hi> in Latine <hi>Sculptile,</hi> is used in Scripture
to signifie an Idol: Let them be confounded
who adore <hi>Sculptilia,</hi> that is, Idols, saith the
Psalmist, and so the Septuagint translate it in
this very place <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an Idol, Thou shalt
not make to thy self an Idol; so that it was
an artifice of the Protestants to make their
assertion seem plausible, to translate Image
instead of Idol; and not a certain kind of
Image neither, but any whatsoever. Thou
shalt not make to thy self any graven Image.
Now what is all this to Catholicks, who
neither make to themselves, nor adore Idols,
nor yield Soveraign honour or acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Deity to any but God? We give in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a veneration to Images, but the Image
of God is not another God besides him, nor is
the Worship of it the Worship of another
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45050:29"/>
God, but of him who is represented by it:
for St. <hi>Basil</hi> saith, The Worship of an Image
stayes not there, but is referred or carried to
the prototype, or thing represented.</p>
            <p>We give therefore an inferior, or relative
honour only to the Sacred Images of Christ,
and his blessed Mother, and Saints, not <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triam,</hi>
the Worship due to God, but <hi>Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam
adorationem,</hi> a certain honorary Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
expressed by kissing them, or putting off
our Hats, or kneeling before them, much like
the Worship given to the Chair of State, or the
Kings Picture, or his Garment by the like
actions; or to come nearer to the subject, such
as was commanded to be given by <hi>Moses</hi> and
<hi>Joshua</hi> to the ground whereon they stood, by
putting off their Shoos, because it was holy;
and by the Iews, in adoring the footstool of
God,<note place="margin">Ep. 17. ad Marcellam.</note> or falling down before it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 98. 5.
and in Worshipping (as St. <hi>Jerome</hi> testifies
they did) that part of the Temple called the
Holy of Holies, because there were the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims
(sacred Images ordered by God himself
to be placed there) the propitiatory (represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Gods Throne) and the Ark, (his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stool)
In a word, such as the Protestants
themselves give to the Name of Iesus when
they hear it spoken, by putting off their
Hats, and bowing at it, or to the Elements
of Bread and Wine in the Supper, by kneeling
before them, as figures representing the death
of Christ. If condescendence to the conscience
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45050:30"/>
of weaker Brethren, will permit to own they
have any honour or veneration for them, or
for the Altar before which they how. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this point, the Objector brings a Text,
which forbids us to give the Soveraign ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
due to God, to an Idol: but let us hear
out of Scripture an express Text that it is
not lawful to give to holy Images, and other
things relating to God, an inferiour or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
Worship, such as we have declared, and
that will be to the purpose.</p>
            <p>§. He aims to conclude the Catholick
Church guilty of Idolatry, from the adoration
of the bread (as he believes it) in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist.
Now to do this, he ought to prove,
that what we adore in the Eucharist, is bread
indeed. But instead of that, he brings a
comparison between <hi>our</hi> adoration of Christ
in the Eucharist, and the Heathens adoration
of the Sun: <hi>viz. That the Papists by the
same Argument, make the Worship of the
bread in the Eucharist not to be Idolatry,
which would excuse the Heathens Worship
of the Sun and of their Statues from Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry;
For if it be not therefore Idolatry,</hi>
sayes he, <hi>because they suppose the bread to
be God, then the Worship of the Sun was
not Idolatry in them, who supposed the
Sun to be God.</hi> I shall not complain here of
the unhandsomness of the expression, that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
suppose the bread to be God, just as
the Heathens supposed the Sun to be God:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45050:30"/>
whereas he knows, that Catholicks believe, that
the substance of the bread is changed into
Christs body; but shall answer to the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
That the Worship of Christ in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist,
is not Idolatry, because we only sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
him to be really present under the form
of bread, but because we know and believe
this upon the same grounds and Motives up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which we believe (and those Motives
stronger than any Protestant hath (if he have
no other than the Catholick to believe) that
Christ is God, and consequently to be adored.
And therefore that you may the better see the
inefficaciousness of the Argument, suppose it
dropt from the Pen of an <hi>Arrian</hi> against the
adoration of Christ as God, and it will be of
as much force to evince that to be Idolatry, as
it is from the Objection to prove the adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of him in the Eucharist to be so, see there
how an <hi>Arrian</hi> might argue in the same form.
The same Argument which would make the
grossest Heathen Idolatry lawful, cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
any act from Idolatry: but the same Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
whereby the Protestants make the
Worship of Christ (a pure man, sayes the
<hi>Arrian)</hi> not to be Idolatry: would make the
grossest Heathen Idolatry not to be so: For if
it be not therefore Idolatry, because they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Christ to be God, then the Worship of the
Sun was not Idolatry, by them who supposed
the Sun to be God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now the same an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
which solves the <hi>Arrians</hi> argument
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45050:31"/>
against the adoration of Christ as God, serves
no less to solve the Objectors Argument
against the adoration of him in the Eucharist,
since we have a like Divine Revelation for
his real presence under the Sacramental Signs,
as we have for his being true God and
Man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But what if Catholicks should be mistaken
in their belief? would it then follow, that
they were Idolaters?</hi> Dr. Taylor <hi>an Eminent
and leading man amongst the Protestants,
denyes the consequence. His words are these,
in the Liberty of</hi> Prophecying, <hi>Sect. 20.
Numb.</hi> 26. Idolatry, <hi>sayes he,</hi> is a forsaking
the true God, and giving Divine Worship
to a creature, or to an Idol, that is, to an
Imaginary God, who hath no foundation
in Essence or Existence: And this is that
kind of superstition, which by Divines is
called the superstition of an undue object:
Now it is evident, that the object of their
(that is, the Catholicks) adoration (that
which is represented to them in their
minds, their thoughts and purposes, and
by which God principally, if not solely,
takes estimate of humane actions) in the
blessed Sacrament, is the only true and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
God, hypostatically joyned with his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
humanity, which humanity they believe
actually present under the Veil of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental
Signs; and if they thought him
not present, they are so far from worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45050:31"/>
the bread in this case, that themselves
profess it Idolatry to do so; which is a
demonstration <hi>(mark that)</hi> that their soul
hath nothing in it, that is Idolatrical. If
their confidence and fanciful opinion (so
he terms the faith of Catholicks) hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
them upon so great a mistake (as
without doubt, he sayes it hath) yet the
will hath nothing in it, but what is a
great enemy to Idolatry. <hi>Et nihil ardet
in inferno nisi propria voluntas;</hi> that is, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
burns in Hell, but proper Will. <hi>Thus</hi>
Dr. Taylor; <hi>and I think it will be a task
worthy the Objectors pains, to solve his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if he will not absolve us from being
Idolaters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 7. He proceeds to prove, that Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
are guilty of Idolatry, by their Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Saints.: And his Argument is this;
<hi>If the supposition of a middle excellency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and us, be a sufficient ground
for formal Invocation, then the Heathens
Worship of their inferiour Deities, could
be no Idolatry, for the Heathens still pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
that they did not give to them the
Worship proper to the Supream God,
which is as much as is pretended by the
devoutest Papists in justification of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
of Saints.</hi> To answer this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I shall need little more than to expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
the hard words in it; which thus I do.
By persons of a middle excellency, we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45050:32"/>
persons endowed with supernatural gifts
of Grace in this life, and Glory in Heaven,
whose prayers by consequence are acceptable
and available with God, what he means by
formal Invocation, I understand not well: but
what we understand by it, is desiring or pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those just persons to pray for us. The
Supream Deity of the Heathens is known to
be <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and their inferiour Deities, <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
Mars, Bacchus, Vulcan,</hi> and the like
rabble of Devils, as the Scripture calls them,
The gods of the Heathens are Devils. The
terms thus explicated, 'tis easie to see the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consequence
of the Argument, that because the
Heathens were Idolaters in worshipping <hi>Mars</hi>
and <hi>Venus</hi> their inferiour Deities, or rather
Devils, though they pretended not to give
them the Worship proper to <hi>Jupiter</hi> their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
God: Therefore the Catholicks, must
be guilty of Idolatry, in desiring the servants
of the true God, to pray for them to him; upon
this account we must not desire the prayer of a
just man, even in this life, because this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Invocation will be to make him an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Deity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But if some Sect of Heathens, as the</hi> Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,
<hi>did attain to the knowledge of the true
God, yet</hi> St. Paul <hi>says, they did not glorifie
him as God; but changed his glory into an
Image made like to corruptible man, adoring
and offering Sacrifice due to God alone, to
the Statues themselves, or the inferiour Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45050:32"/>
they supposed to dwell or assist in them.
Which inferiour Deities</hi> St. Austin <hi>upon the
ninety sixth Psalm, proves to be Devils or
evil Angels, because they required Sacrifice to
be offered to them, and would be worshipped
as Gods. Now what comparison there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
this worship of the Heathens inferiour
Deities, and Christians worship of Saints and
Angels, let the same</hi> St. Austin <hi>declare in his
twentieth Book against</hi> Faustus <hi>the</hi> Manichae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
chap. 21. Faustus <hi>there calumniates the
Catholicks (the word is</hi> St. Austins) <hi>because
they honoured the Memories or Shrines of
Martyrs, charging them to have turned the
Idols into Martyrs, whom they worship (said
he) with like Vows. The Objection you see is
not new, that Catholicks make inferiour Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of their Saints.</hi> Faustus <hi>long ago made
it, and</hi> St. Austins <hi>answer will serve as
well now as then.</hi> Christian people, <hi>sayes
he,</hi> do with religious solemnity celebrate the
memory of Martyrs, both to excite to the
imitation of them, and to become parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of their Merits, and be holpen by their
prayers, but to that we erect Altars, not to
any of the Martyrs, but to the God of
Martyrs, although in memory of the said
Martyrs; For what Bishop officiating at
the Altar, in the places where their holy
bodies are deposited; does say at any
time we offer to thee <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> or
<hi>Cyprian?</hi> but what is offered to God, who
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45050:33"/>
crown'd the Martyrs, at the memories or
Shrines of those whom he crowned, that
being put in mind by the very places, a
greater affection may be raised in us to
quicken our love, both to those whom we
may imitate, and towards him by whose
assistance we can do it. We worship there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Martyrs with that Worship of love
and society, with which even in this life
also holy men of God are worshipped,
whose heart we judge prepared to suffer
the like Martyrdom for the truth of the
Gospel. But we worship <hi>them</hi> so much
the more devoutly, because more securely,
after they have overcome all the Incertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of this world; as also we praise them
more confidently now reigning Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
in a more happy life, than whilst
they were sighting in this; but with that
Worship, which in Greek is called <hi>Latria,</hi>
(and cannot be expressed by one word in
Latin) for as much as it is a certain ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
properly due to the Divinity, we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
worship them, nor teach them to be
worshipped, but God alone. Now where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the offering of Sacrifice belongs to this
Worship (of <hi>Latria)</hi> from whence they
are called Idolaters, who gave it also to
Idols, by no means do we suffer any such
thing, or command it to be offered, to any
Martyr, or any holy soul, or any Angel:
And whosoever declines into this Error,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45050:33"/>
we reprove him by sound Doctrine, either
that he may be corrected, or avoided.—
<hi>And a little after.</hi> It is a much less sin, for
a man to be derided by the Martyrs for
drunkenness, then ever fasting to offer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to them. I say to sacrifice to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
I say not to sacrifice to God in the
memories (or Churches) of the Martyrs,
which we do most frequently, by that <hi>rite</hi>
alone, by which in the manifestation of the
New Testament he hath commanded Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to be offered to him, which belongs to
that Worship, which is called <hi>Latria,</hi> and
is due only to God. <hi>This was the Doctrine
and practice of Christian people in St.</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustines
<hi>time, and that he himself held formal
Invocations a part of the Worship due to
Saints, is evident from the prayer he made
to St.</hi> Cyprian <hi>after his Martyrdom.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Li. de Bapt. cont. Donat. c. 1.</note> Adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verit<expan>

with his prayer, <hi>that by Gods grace we
may, as far as we are able, imitate his good
works. Thus St.</hi> Austin, <hi>where you see he
directs his prayer to St.</hi> Cyprian, <hi>which I
take to be formal invocation; and for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
confirmation of it, we have the ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Confession of</hi> Calvin himself, <hi>Instit. li. 3.
ch. 20. n. 22. where speaking of the third
Council of</hi> Carthage, <hi>in which St.</hi> Austin <hi>was
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45050:34"/>
present, he acknowledged it was the custom at
that time to say,</hi> Sancta Maria, aut Sancte
Petre Ora pro nobis; <hi>Holy</hi> Mary, <hi>or Holy</hi>
Peter <hi>pray for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now <hi>Madam,</hi> what if after all this,
he himself shall deny, that any of the opposite
Tenets are Articles of his faith, viz. <hi>That
honour is not to be given to the Images of
Christ and his Saints, that what appears to
be bread in the Eucharist, is not the body of
Christ: That it is not lawful to invocate
the Saints to pray for us.</hi> Press him close,
and I believe you shall find him deny, that he
believes any one of these Negative points to be
Divine truths; and if so, you will easily see
his charge of Idolatry against us, to be vain
and groundless.</p>
            <p>Having thus given a direct and punctual
answer to his argument, I must now expect <hi>as
much charity from him, as is consistent
with Scripture and Reason.</hi> How much that
is, you will see in his third Answer to the first
Question. But to proceed.</p>
            <p>§. 8. He brings a Miscellany of <hi>such opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi>
and <hi>practices</hi> (as he calls them)
<hi>which are very apt to hinder a good life,
and therefore none who have a care of their
salvation, can venture their souls in the
communion of such a Church, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
enjoyns, or publickly allows them.</hi>
He reckons up no less than ten. 1. That we
<hi>destroy the necessity of good life, by make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:45050:34"/>
the Sacrament of Penance</hi> (that is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
and absolution) <hi>joyned with contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
sufficient for salvation.</hi> And do not
Protestants make contrition alone, which is
less, sufficient for salvation? But perhaps the
joyning of confession and absolution with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition,
makes it of a malignant nature: If
so, certainly when the Book of Common Prayer
in the visitation of the sick, enjoyns the sick
man, if he find his conscience troubled with
any weighty matter, to make a special con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
and receive absolution from the Priest
in the same words the Catholick Church uses,
it prescribes him, that as a means to prepare
himself for a holy death, which in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Objector, destroyes the necessity of
good life.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Catholicks,</hi> he sayes, <hi>take off the care
of good life, by supposing an expiation of
sin (by the prayer of the living) after
death:</hi> But certainly the belief of temporal
pains to be sustained after death, if there be
not a perfect expiation of sin in this life, by
works of penance, is rather apt to make a man
careful not to commit the least sin, than to
take off the care of a good life. And though
he be ascertained by faith, that he may be
holpen by the charitable suffrages of the
faithful living, yet this is no more encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to him to sin, than it would be to a
Spendthrift to run into debt, and be cast into
Prison, because he knows he may be relieved by
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:45050:35"/>
the charity of his Friends. If he were sure
there were no Prison for him, that would be
an encouragement indeed to play the Spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrift.
And this is the case of the Protestants
in their denyal of Purgatory.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>The sincerity of Devotion,</hi> he sayes, <hi>is
much obstructed by prayers in a language
which many understand not.</hi> If he speak
of private prayers, all Catholicks are taught
to say them in their Mother Tongue: If of the
publick prayers of the Church, I understand not
why it may not be done with as much sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of devotion, the people joyning their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and particular prayers with the Priest, as
their Embassador to God, as if they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
him: I am sure the effects of a sincere
devotion, for nine hundred years together
which this manner of Worship produced in
this Nation, were much different from those
we have seen since the readucing of the publick
Lyturgie into English, as is manifest from
those Monuments, which yet remain of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
Colledges, Religious Houses, &amp;c. with
their endowments, and in the conversion of
many Nations from Heathenism to Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
effected by the labours and zeal of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Missionaries in those times, &amp;c. But
this is a matter of Discipline, and so not to
be regulated by the fancies of private men,
but the judgement of the Church; and so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
hath this practice been both in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Greek and Latine Churches, and is
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:45050:35"/>
still (by the confession of the (Protestant)
Authors themselves of the Bible of many Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
Printed at <hi>London, Anno 1655.)</hi>
in most of the Sects of Christians, to have not
only the Scriptures, but also the Liturgies
and Rituals in a Tongue unknown, but to the
Learned among them: that who will dispute
against it, must prepare himself to hear the
censure of St. <hi>Austin, Ep.</hi> 118. where he
saith, <hi>That it is a point of most insolent
madness, to dispute whether that be to be
observed, which is frequented by the whole
Church through the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>He sayes,</hi> The sincerity of Devotion is
much obstructed, by making the efficacy
of Sacraments depend upon the bare ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration,
whether our minds be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for them or not. <hi>In what Council
this Doctrine was defined, I never read; but
as for the Sacrament of Penance, which I
suppose he chiefly aims at, I read in the
Council of</hi> Trent, Sess. 14. <hi>Falso quidam ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniantur,</hi>
That some do falsly calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
Catholick Writers, as if they taught
the Sacrament of Penance did confer Grace
without the good motion of the receiver,
which the Church of God never taught nor
thought. <hi>But I am rather inclined to look
upon this as a mistake, than a calumny in
the Objector.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. He sayes, <hi>The sincerity of devotion
is much obstructed by discouraging the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45050:36"/>
reading of Scriptures, which is our most
certain Rule of Faith and Life.</hi> Here he
calls the Churches prudential dispensing the
reading of Scripture to persons, whom she
judges fit and disposed for it, and not to such
whom she judges in a condition to receive, or
do harm by it, a discouraging the reading of
Scriptures; which is no other than whereas
<hi>St. Paul, Coloss.</hi> 3. 21. enjoyns Fathers not
to provoke their children, lest they be discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged;
one should reprove a Father for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
his child, because he will not put
a Knife or Sword into his hands, when he
foresees he will do mischief with it to himself
or others; the Scriptures in the hands of a
meek and humble soul, who submits its
judgement in the interpretation of it to that
of the Church, is a Sword to defend it: but
in the hands of an arrogant and presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Spirit, that hath no Guide to interpret it,
but its own fancy or passion, it is a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Weapon, with which he will wound both
himself and others. The first that permitted
promiscuous reading of Scripture in our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
was King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth; and many
years were not passed, but he found the ill
consequences of it; for in a Book set forth by
him in the year 1542. he complains in the
Preface, <hi>That he found entred into some
of his peoples hearts an inclination to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
understanding of it, presumption, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancy,
carnal liberty, and contention:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45050:36"/>
which he compares to the seven worse Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
in the Gospel, with which the Devil
entred into the house that was purged and
cleansed. Whereupon he declares that for
that part of the Church ordained to be
taught, (that is, the Lay people) it ought
not to be denyed certainly, that the reading
of the Old and New Testament is not so
necessary for all those folks, that of duty
they ought and be bound to read it; but
as the Prince and Policy of the Realm shall
think convenient, so to be tolerated or taken
from it. Consonant whereunto,</hi> saith he,
<hi>the Politick Law of our Realm, hath now
restrained it from a great many.</hi> This was
the judgement of him, who first took upon
him the Title of Head of the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;</hi>
and if that ought not to have been
followed in after times, let the dire effects of
so many new Sects and Fanaticisms, as have
risen in <hi>England</hi> from the reading of it, bear
witness. For as <hi>St. Austin</hi> sayes,<note place="margin">Tract. 18. in To.</note> 
               <hi>Neque
enim natae sunt Haereses; Heresies have no
other Origen but hence, that the Scriptures
which in themselves are good, are not well
understood, and what is understood amiss
in them, is rashly and boldly asserted,</hi> viz.
<hi>to be the sense of them.</hi> And now whether
the Scriptures left to the private interpretation
of every fanciful spirit, as it is among Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
be a most certain Rule of Faith and
Life, I leave to your self to judge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:45050:37"/>
6. <hi>He sayes,</hi> The sincerity of devotion is
much obstructed by the multitude of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious
observations never used in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church, as he is ready to defend, <hi>he
should have said to prove; for we deny any
such to be used in the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. By the gross abuse of people in Pardons
and Indulgences. Against this, I can assert
as an eye-witness, the great devotion caused
by the wholsome use of Indulgences in Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Countreys: there being no Indulgence or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
granted, but enjoyns him that will
avail himself of it, to confess his sins, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Sacraments, to pray, fast, and give
alms, all which duties are with great devotion
performed by Catholick people, which without
the incitement of an Indulgence, had possibly
been left undone.</p>
            <p>8. He sayes, <hi>The sincerity of devotion
is much obstructed, by denying the Cup
to the Laity, contrary to the practice of
the Church in the solemn celebration of the
Eucharist for a thousand years after Christ.</hi>
This thousand years after Christ makes a great
noise, as if it were not as much in the power
of the Church a thousand years after Christ,
as well as in the first or second Century to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and change things of their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
indifferent, such as the communicating
under one or both kinds, was ever held to be
by Catholicks. But although the Cup were
not then denyed to the Laity, yet that the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:45050:37"/>
custome of receiving but under one kind was
permitted, even in the primitive Church, in
private communions, the objector seems to
grant, becasue he speaks only of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of it in the solemn Celebration, and
that it was also in use in publick Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
is evident from Examples of that time,
both in the Greek Church in the time of
St. <hi>Chrysostome;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sozomen. li. &amp; Hist. c. 5. &amp; Niceph. li. 13. c. 11. S. Leo Ser. 4. de Quad.</note> and of the Latin in the time
of St. <hi>Leo</hi> the great. As for the pretended
obstruction of Devotion, you must know Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
believe that under either species or kind,
whole Christ true God and man is contained
and received; and if it be accounted an hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance
to devotion to receive the total refection
of our soul, though but under one kind, what
must it be to believe that I receive him under
neither, but instead of him have Elements of
Bread and Wine? Surely nothing can be more
efficacious to stir up Reverence and Devotion
in us, than to believe, that God himself will
personally enter under our Roof.</p>
            <p>The ninth <hi>Hinderance of the sincerity of
devotion is, that we make it in the power
of a person to dispense in Oathes and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
contrary to the Law of God.</hi> To
this I answer, That some kind of Oaths, the
condition of the person and other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
considered, may be Iudged to be hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and not fit to be kept, and the dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in them is, no more than to Iudge or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
them to be so: and consequently to do
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:45050:38"/>
this cannot be a hinderance but a furtherance
to devotion, nor is it contrary to the Law of
God which commands nothing thats hurtful to
be done. As for Marriages we acknowledge
the Church may dispense in some degrees of
Consanguinity and Affinity, but in nothing
contrary to the Law of God.</p>
            <p>His tenth pretended <hi>Obstruction of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is, that we make disobedience to the
Church in Disputable matters, more hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
than disobedience to Christ in unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable
things, as Marriage,</hi> he saith, <hi>in a
Priest to be a greater crime than Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
I Answer, That whether a Priest may
Marry or no (supposing the Law of the Church
forbidding it) is not a disputable matter;
but 'tis out of Question, even by the Law of
God that Obedience is to be given to the
Commands or Prohibitions of the Church:
The Antithesis therefore between disobedience
to the Church, in disputable matters, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
to the Laws of Christ in unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
things, is not only impertinent to the
Marriage of Priests which is unquestionably
forbidden; but supposing the matter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
disputable after the Churches Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
destroys all obedience to the Church. But
if it suppose them only disputable before, then
why may not the Church interpose her Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and put them out of dispute?</p>
            <p>But still it seems strange to them, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cannot or will not take the Word of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:45050:38"/>
Christ, that is, his Counsel of Chastitie, <hi>that
Marriage in a Priest should be a greater sin
than Fornication.</hi> But he considers not, that
though Marriage in it self be honourable, yet,
if it be prohibited to a certain order of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
by the Church to whom Christ himself
commands us to give obedience, and they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
themselves by a voluntary vow to live in
perpetual Chastity, the Law of God command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us to pay our Vows, it loses its honour in
such persons, and if contracted after such vow
made, is in the language of the Fathers no
better than Adultery. In the primitive
Church it was the custome of some Younger
Widdows to Dedicate themselves to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Church, and in order thereunto to
take upon them a peculiar habit, and make a
vow of continency for the future. Now in
case they Married after this, St. <hi>Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 12. saith, That they incurred
Damnation, because by so doing, they made
void their first faith, that is, as the Fathers
Expound it, the vow they had made. And
the fourth Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> in which
were 214 Bishops, and among them St. <hi>Austin</hi>
gives the Reason in these words; <hi>If Wives
who commit Adultery are guilty to their
Husbands, how much more shall such Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
as change their Religious State, be
noted with the crime of Adultery?</hi> And if
this were so in Widdows, much more in
Priests, if by Marrying they shall make void
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:45050:39"/>
their first Faith given to God, when they were
consecrated in a more peculiar manner to his
Service.</p>
            <p>Thus much may suffice for Answer to the
Argument, which with its intricate terms
may seem to puzzle an unlearned Reader,
let us now speak a word to the true state of
the Controversie, which is, whether Marriage
or single life in a Priest be more apt to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
or further devotion. And St. <hi>Paul</hi>
himself hath determined the Question, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
7. 32. where he saith, He that is unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
careth for the things that belong to our
Lord, how he may please our Lord; But he
that is Married careth for the things that are
of the World, how be may please his Wife.
This is the difference he putteth between the
Married and Single life, that <hi>this</hi> is apt to
make us care for the things which belong
to God; and <hi>that</hi> to divert our thoughts
from him to the things of the World. Iudge
therefore which of these states is most conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
for Priests, whose proper office it is to
attend wholly to the things of God?</p>
            <p>Having thus cleared Catholick Doctrines
from being any wayes obstructive to good life
or devotion, I shall proceed to his third Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by which he will still prove that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
run a great hazard of their souls,
in adhering to the Communion of the Church
of <hi>Rome, Because it exposeth the Faith of
Christians to so great uncertainty.</hi> This is
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45050:39"/>
a strange charge from the pen of a Protestant,
who hath no other certainty for his faith but
every mans interpretation of the Letter of the
Scriptures. But, First he saith it doth this,
<hi>By making the Authority of the Scriptures
to depend upon the infallibility of the
Church, when the Churches infallibility
must be proved by the Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To this I Answer that the Authority of the
Scripture, not in it self, for so it hath its
Authority from God; but in order to us and
our belief of it, depends upon the infallibility
of the Church.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Li. contr. Epist. fund.</note> 
               <hi>And therefore St.</hi> Austin
<hi>saith of himself,</hi> That he would not believe
the Gospel, unless the Authority of the
Catholick Church did move him. <hi>And if
you ask him what moved him to submit to
that Authority; he tells you,</hi> That besides
the Wisdom he found in the Tenets of
the Church, there were many other things
which most justly held him in it: as the
consent of people and Nations, an Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
begun by Miracles, nourished by hope,
increased by Charity, and established by
Antiquity, the succession of Priests, from
the very seat of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to whom our
Lord commended the feeding of his Sheep,
unto the present Bishoprick. Lastly, The
very name of Catholick which this Church
alone among so many Heresies hath not
without cause obtained so particularly to
her self; that whereas all Hereticks would
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:45050:40"/>
be called Catholicks, yet if a stranger de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
where the Catholicks go to Church,
none of these Hereticks dares to shew either
his own house or Church. These (saith
St. <hi>Austin,)</hi> so many and great, most dear
bonds of the name of Christian, do justly
hold a believing man in the Catholick
Church. <hi>These were the grounds which
moved that great man to submit to her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:
And when Catholick Authors prove
the infallibility of the Church from Scriptures,
'tis an Argument</hi> ad hominem <hi>to convince
Protestants who will admit nothing but Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
and yet when they are convinced, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
at them as illogical disputants, because
they prove it from Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next he saith we overthrow all foundation
of Faith, because <hi>We will not believe our
sences in the plainest objects of them.</hi>
But what if God have interposed his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
as he hath done in the case of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist,
where he tells us, that <hi>it is his Body,</hi>
must we believe our sences rather than God?
or must we not believe them in other things,
because in the particular case of the Eucharist
we must believe God, rather than our sences?
Both these consequences you see are absurd:
Now for the case it self, in which he instances,
Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> above cited confesses, that they
<hi>(viz.</hi> Catholicks) <hi>have a divine Revelation
(viz.</hi> Christs word, This is my Body) <hi>whose
Litteral and Grammatical sence, if that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:45050:40"/>
sence were intended, would warrant them
to do violence to all the Sciences, in the
Circle;</hi> but, I add, it would be no precedent
to them not to believe their sences in other
the plainest objects of them, as in the matter of
Tradition, or Christs body after the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>3. He saith that <hi>We expose faith to great
uncertainty, by denying to men the use of
their Judgement and Reason as to matters of
faith proposed by a Church,</hi> that is, we deny
particular mens Iudgement, as to matters of
faith, to be as good if not better than the
Churches, and to inferre from hen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, that we
make Faith uncertain, is just as if on the
contrary one should say, that Protestants make
faith certain by exposing matter of faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by the Church, to be discussed and
reversed by the Iudgement and reason (or
rather fancy) of every private man. We
have good store of this kind of certainty in
<hi>England.</hi> But as for the use of our Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Reason, as to the matters themselves
proposed by the Church, it is the daily business
of Divines and Preachers, not only to shew
them not to be repugnant to any natural
truth, but also to illustrate them with Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
drawn from reason. But the use, he
would have of reason, is I suppose, to believe
nothing, but what his reason can comprehend,
and this is not only irrational in its self, but
contrary to the Doctrine of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> where he
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:45050:41"/>
commands us to captivate our understandings
to the Obedience of Faith.</p>
            <p>4. He adds, <hi>We expose faith to uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
by making the Church power ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to making new Articles of Faith.</hi>
And this if it were true, were something in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to his purpose. But the Church never
yet owned any such power, in her General
Councils, but only to manifest and establish the
Doctrine received from her Fore-fathers; as is
to be seen in the prooems of all the Sessions of
the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> where the Fathers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they declare what is to be believed, ever
premise that what they declare, is the same
they have received by Tradition from the
Apostles. And because it may happen that
some particular Doctrine was not so plainly
delivered to each part of the Church, as it
happened in St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> case, concerning
the non-rebaptization of Hereticks, we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it is in her power, <hi>to make that neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to be believed which was not so before,</hi>
not by inventing new Articles, but by decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
more explicitely the Truths contained
in Scripture and Tradition.</p>
            <p>Lastly he saith, <hi>We expose Faith to great
uncertainty,</hi> because the Church pretending to
infallibility, does not determine Controversies
on foot among our selves. As if faith could
not be certain, unless all Controversies among
particular men be determined, what then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
of the certainty of Protestants faith,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45050:41"/>
who could yet never find out a sufficient
means to determine any one Controversie among
them? for if that means be plain Scripture,
what one Iudgeth plain, another Iudgeth not
so, and they acknowledge no Iudge between
them to decide the Controversie. As for the
Catholick Church if any Controversies arise
concerning the Doctrine delivered (as in
St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> case) she determines the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
by declaring what is of Faith. And
for other Controversies which belong not to
faith, she permits, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, every
one to abound in his own sence. And thus
much in Answer to his third Argument, by
which, and what hath been said to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Objections, it appears that he hath not at
all proved what he asserted in his second An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to the first Question, viz. <hi>That all those
who are in the Communion of the Church
of</hi> Rome <hi>do run so great a hazard of their
Salvation, that none who have a care of
their souls ought to embrace or continue in
it.</hi> But he hath a third Answer for us, in case
the former faile; and it is,</p>
            <p>§. 10. That <hi>a Protestant leaving the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Protestant Church doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr
a greater guilt, than one who was bred
up in the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and continues
therein by invincible ignorance.</hi> This is
the directest answer he gives to the Question,
and what it imports is this, That invincible
Ignorance (and <hi>he doth not know what
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45050:42"/>
allowance God will make for that neither)</hi>
is the only Anchor which a Catholick hath to
save himself by. If by discoursing with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
and reading their Books, he be not
sufficiently convinced, whereas he ought in the
supposition of the Answerer, to be so, that the
Letter of the Scripture as interpretable by
every private mans reason is a most certain
Rule of Faith and Life; but is still over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled
by his own Motives, (the same which
held St. <hi>Austin</hi> in the bosome of the Catholick
Church) he is guilty of wilful Ignorance
and consequently a lost man; there is no
hope of Salvation for him. Much less for a
Protestant who shall embrace the Catholick
Communion, because <hi>he is supposed</hi> (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
from the same Rule) <hi>to have sufficient
conviction of the Errors of the Roman
Church, or is guilty of wilful Ignorance, If
he have it not, which is a damnable sin, and
unrepented of destroyes salvation.</hi> So that
now the upshot of the Answer to the Question,
Whether a Protestant embracing Catholick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
upon the same motives, which one bred
and well grounded in it, hath to remain in it,
may be equally saved with him, comes to this,
that they shall both be damned, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equally,
because the converted Catholick more
deeply, than he that was bred so. And now
who can but lament the sad condition of that
great Doctor and Father of the Church, and
hitherto reputed St. <hi>Austin,</hi> who rejecting
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:45050:42"/>
the <hi>Manichees</hi> pretended rule of Scripture,
upon the aforesaid grounds, left their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
to embrace the Communion of the
Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> And what is become now
of their distinction of points fundamental
from not fundamental, which heretofore they
thought sufficient to secure both Catholicks
and Protestants Salvation, and to charge us
with unconscionable uncharitableness in not
allowing them to be sharers with us. The
absurdness of these consequences may serve
for a sufficient conviction of the nullity of his
third and last answer to the first Question.</p>
            <p>As for what he saith to the second, I agree
so far with him, that every Christian is bound
to choose the Communion of the purest Church,
but which that Church is, must be seen by the
grounds it brings to prove the Doctrines it
teaches, to have been delivered by Christ and
his Apostles. That Church is to be judged
purest which hath the best grounds: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
it is of necessity to Salvation to
embrace the communion of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What then you are bound to do in reason
and conscience is, to see which Religion of the
two, hath the strongest Motives for it, and to
embrace that as you will answer the contrary
to God and your own soul. To help you to
do this, and that the Answerer may have the
less exception against them, I will give you a
Catalogue of Catholick Motives (though not
all neither) in the words of the forecited
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45050:43"/>
Dr.</hi> Taylor, <hi>advertising only for brevity sake,
I leave out some mentioned by him, and that
in these I set down, you also give allowance
for some expressions of his, with which he hath
mis-represented them: Thus then he,</hi> Liberty
of Proph. Sect. 20. <hi>Speaking of Catholicks,</hi>
The beauty and Splendour of their Church,
their pompous (he should have said) so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Service; the stateliness and solemnity
of the Hierarchy, their name of Catholick,
which they suppose (he should have said,
their very Adversaries give them) as their
own due, and to concern no other Sect of
Christians; the Antiquity of many of their
Doctrines, (he should have said all) the
continual succession of their Bishops, their
immediate derivation from the Apostles;
their Title to succeed St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(he should have said due) expression
of Minor Bishops (he means, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
the Pope head of the Church)
which by being old records, have obtained
credibility; the multitude and variety of
People which are of their perswasion; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
consent with Antiquity in many
Ceremonials, which other Churches have
rejected; and a pretended and sometimes
(he should have said alwayes) apparent
consent with some elder Ages in matters
Doctrinal; The great consent of one part
with another in that which most of them
affirm to be <hi>de fide</hi> (of Faith) The great
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45050:43"/>
differences which are commenced among
their Adversaries, abusing the liberty of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying
into a very great licentiousness;
Their happiness of being Instruments
in converting divers (he should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have said of all) Nations. The
piety and austerity of their Religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Men and Women; The single life of
their Priests and Bishops, the severity of
their Fasts, and their exteriour observances,
the great reputation of their first Bishops
for faith and sanctity; the known ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
of some of those persons, whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes
the Religious persons pretend to
imitate; the oblique Arts and indirect
proceedings of some of those who depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from them, and amongst many other
things the names of Heretick and Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
which they with infinite pertinacity
(he should have said, upon the same
grounds the Fathers did) fasten upon all
that disagree from them. These things,
saith he, and divers others may very easily
perswade persons of much reason, and more
piety to retain that which they know to have
been the Religion of their Fore-fathers,
which had actually possession and seizure of
mens understandings, before the opposite
professions (to wit of Protestant, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian,
Anabaptist, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> had a name.</p>
            <p>Thus Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> an eminent and leading
man amongst the Protestants; and if <hi>he</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:45050:44"/>
confess that these Motives were sufficient for a
Catholick to retain his Religion, they must
be of like force to perswade a dis-interessed
Protestant to embrace it, unless the Protestants
can produce Motives for their Religion of
greater, or at least equal force, with these,
which so great a man among them confesseth,
that Catholicks have for theirs. Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you must call upon the Author of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
you sent me to produce a Catalogue of
grounds, or at least some one ground for the
Protestant Religion of greater or equal force
with all these: And as Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> saith,
divers others which he omitted, <hi>viz.</hi> The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
interpreted by the consent of Fathers,
the determination of General Councils, the
known Maxime of Catholicks, that nothing is
to be believed of Faith, but what was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from their Fore-fathers as handed
down from the Apostles. The testimonie of
the present Church, of no less Authority now,
than in St. <hi>Austins</hi> time, both for the Letter
and the sence of the Scripture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Do this,
and the Controversie will quickly be at an
end. Particular disputes are endless, and above
the understanding of such, as are not learned;
but in grounds and principles, 'tis not so
hard for Reason and common sence to Iudge.
That you may the better do it in your case,
I shall desire you to take these two Cautions
along with you:</p>
            <p>First, That the Subject of the present
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:45050:44"/>
Controversie, are not those Articles in which
the Protestants agree with us, and for which
they may pretend to produce the same
Motives, we do: But in those in which they
dissent from us such as are <hi>no Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,
no Purgatory, no honour due
to Images, no Invocation to Saints, and
the like,</hi> in which the very Essence of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant,
as distinct from Catholick consists.
What Motives they can or will produce for these.
I do not foresee: The pretence of Scriptures
being sufficiently plain hath no place here,
because then the foresaid Negatives would be
necessary to be believed as divine Truths. And
for their own Reason and Learning, it will be
found too light when put into the scale against
that of the Catholick Church for so many
Ages.</p>
            <p>The second Caution is, That you be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to distinguish between Protestants pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
grounds for their own Religion,
and finding fault with ours. An Atheist
can cavil and find fault with the grounds
which learned men bring to prove a Deity,
such as are the Order of this visible World,
the general consent of Nations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In this
an Atheist thinks he doth somewhat. But
can he produce as good or better grounds for
his own opinion? No, you see then 'tis one
thing to produce grounds for what we hold,
and another to find fault with those which
are produced by the contrary part. The latter
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:45050:45"/>
hath made Controversie so long, and the former
will make it as short; let the Answerer therefore
instead of finding fault with our Motives
produce his own for the Articles in Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
and I am confident you will quickly discern
which carry the most weight, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
which are to be preferred.</p>

Answer to the Questions.</head>
            <head>CHAP. I. Of the Idolatry practised in the Church
of Rome, in the Worship of Images.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>The introduction, concerning the occasion of the
debate. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> makes its
members guilty of Hypocrisie or Idolatry:
First, Of the Worship of God by Images:
Some propositions for clearing the notion of
Divine Worship. It is in Gods power to
determine the way of his Worship, which
being determined, Gods Law, and not our
intention, is to be the rule of Worship. The
main question is, Whether God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
the worshipping of himself by an
Image, under the notion of Idolatry? Of
the meaning of the second Commandment,
from the <hi>terms</hi> therein used, the large sense
and importance of them, which cannot be
understood only of Heathen Idols. Of the
reason of that Law, from Gods infinite
and invisible nature: How far that hath
been acknowledged by Heathens? The Law
against Image Worship no ceremonial Law
respecting meerly the Iews; the reason
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:45050:46"/>
against it made more clear by the Gospel:
The wiser Heathen did not worship their
Images as Gods, yet their worship con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
as Idolatry. The Christian Church
believed the reason of this Law to be immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table;
Of the Doctrine of the second Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Nice;</hi> the opposition to it in <hi>Greece,
Germany, France</hi> and <hi>England.</hi> Of the
Scripture Instances of Idolatry contrary to
the second Commandment, in the Golden
Calf, and the Calves of <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel.</hi>
Of the distinctions used to excuse image-worship
from being Idolatry: The vanity
and folly of them. The instances supposed
to be parallel answered.</p>
            </argument>
            <opener>
               <salute>Madam,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>§. 1. THat increase of <hi>Controversies</hi> in
my answer,<note place="margin">The Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.</note> which the Proposer
of the <hi>Questions,</hi> calls a <hi>superfoetation,</hi> was
but the natural issue of his own <hi>Questions.</hi>
To which, I could not give a just answer,
without mentioning the hazards a person
runs of his salvation in the communion of
the <hi>Roman Church:</hi> and if he thinks these
too many (as in truth they are) he ought
to condemn that <hi>Church</hi> for it, which hath
been the cause of them. And, I know <hi>no
other end I had herein,</hi> but to let you see,
there can be no reason to forsake the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of our <hi>Church,</hi> wherein the way of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:45050:46"/>
salvation is the same, with that of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical</hi>
and <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> for another,
which hath degenerated so much from it; as I
hope will appear in the following Discourse.</p>
            <p>To wave therefore any farther debate,
<hi>concerning the terms or sense of the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
As to the occasion of them,</hi> I could not but
suppose it to relate to your own condition,
and I dare appeal to himself, Whether the
Question of the possibility of the salvation
of a <hi>Protestant</hi> turn'd to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>
were moved for any other end, than there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the easier to draw persons of our <hi>Church</hi>
into their communion; which being so
common, and yet so weak an Artifice, I
had reason to premise an answer to that
purpose: and I do still affirm, that such a
possibility being granted, it is no sufficient
Motive to any one to leave the communion
of one <hi>Church</hi> for another. And whether
this be to his Question or no, I am sure it
is very much to the purpose, for which this
Controversie was first started. I beseech
you therefore <hi>Madam,</hi> do not so much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparage
your own Judgement, and the
<hi>Church</hi> you have been bred up in, to forsake
it, till some better reason be offered, than
the Proposer pretends that his <hi>Questions</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply:
Which, if not for your own sake, yet
for mine I desire you to insist upon, that
I may know one reason at least from them,
(which I cannot yet procure, although I
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:45050:47"/>
have often requested it) why the believing
all the ancient <hi>Creeds</hi> and leading a good
life, may not be sufficient to salvation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
one be of the communion of the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>Rome?</hi> But lest I should be thought to
digress, I return to his Papers, and am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to pass over his unhandsome reflection
on our <hi>Church as in a sinking condition,</hi>
which <hi>God</hi> hath hitherto preserved, and I
hope will do, to the confusion of its ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
But why he should call my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
a supposition, and his own a truth,
before he proved their <hi>Church</hi> to be the
<hi>Catholick Church,</hi> I am yet to seek. And
so I come to the main business.</p>
            <p>§. 2. <hi>My second answer was,</hi> That all those
who are in the communion of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> do run so great a hazard of their
salvation, that none who have a care of their
souls, ought to embrace it, or continue in it.
<hi>which I am amazed he should say,</hi> was not
pertinent to the Question, <hi>if the</hi> Question
<hi>were propounded for any ones satisfaction,
that doubted which</hi> Churches <hi>communion
it were best to embrace? This I proved,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Because <hi>They must by the terms of that
communion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Of the Idolatry of the Roman Church.</note> 
               <hi>be guilty either of Hypocrisie or
Idolatry;</hi> either of which, are sins incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with salvation. Here <hi>he charges me
with a contradiction,</hi> because I overprove
what I intended; but he may easily excuse
me from it, if he will allow the possibility
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45050:47"/>
of salvation to any one who commits any
wilful sins; for in the case of any such sins,
it is true, that they are inconsistent with
salvation, and yet he that doth commit
them, doth but run the hazzard of salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
because he may repent of them. <hi>But
if it be a contradiction to say, that some sins
are inconsistent with salvation, yet those who
commit them, may be saved, though hardly;</hi>
he must make all who commit any wilful
sin to be unavoidably damned; and then
it is to no purpose, what <hi>Church</hi> we are of.
The meaning therefore was this, That Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie
and Idolatry, are sins inconsistent
with a state of salvation; and there is no
way to escape being damned, but by the
repentance of those who are guilty of them.
(But of this more at large in the vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of my third Answer) and those
who are in the communion of the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>Rome,</hi> must be guilty either of the one
or the other of these, I proved by this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
<hi>That Church which requires giving
to the creature the Worship due only to the
Creator, makes the members of it guilty of
Hypocrisie or Idolatry; but the Church of</hi>
Rome <hi>in the Worship of God by Images, the
adoration of Bread in the Eucharist, and the
formal invocation of Saints,</hi> doth require
giving to the creature the worship due on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Creator, therefore it makes the
members of it guilty of Hypocrisie or <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:45050:48"/>
Which I did prove by parts.</p>
            <p>1. §. 3. <hi>Concerning the</hi> Worship <hi>of</hi> God
<hi>by Images,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Of the Worship of Images.</note> 
               <hi>I proved that it could not be
terminated on</hi> God, <hi>because in the second
Commandment he not only denys to receive
it, but threatens to punish those who give
it. To this he answers</hi> 1. That it is a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
to say, that it is the worship of God
by an Image, and yet be terminated wholly on
the creature. 2. That this is built, on a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
of the nature of humane acts, which
though they ought to be governed by the Law
of God, yet when they swerve from it, cease
not to tend to their own proper objects: and
that Gods prohibition of such or such a kind
of Worship, may make it to be unlawful, but
hinders not the act from tending, whither it
is intended; <hi>which he proves</hi> by the prayers
of Thieves and Murderers, to God for good
success; the Iews offering to God in Sacrifice
the blind and the lame, which he hath forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;
<hi>Cains</hi> offering a Sacrifice to God, which
he refused to accept of; <hi>from whence he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,</hi>
That though God should have forbidden
men to worship him by Images, yet it doth
not follow, but the worship so given, would
be terminated on him. 3. That the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Commandment only forbids the worship
of Idols, or the giving the Soveraign honour
due to God to an Idol; but this doth not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
the worship of Images, because they give
to them only an inferiour and relative honour,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:45050:48"/>
and not, that worship which is due to God.
<hi>This is the substance of his answer: but
to let you</hi> see <hi>the insufficiency of it, I shall
prove these two things: 1. That where
God hath prohibited any particular way or
means of giving worship to himself, that
worship so given, cannot be said to be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
on him. 2. That God in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Commandment hath expresly prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
the giving any worship to himself by
an Image; and not barely the worship of
Idols.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That where God hath prohibited any
particular way or means of giving worship
to himself, that worship so given, cannot be
said to be terminated on him: And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<hi>new</hi> this way of proposing this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
seems to him, I do not question to
make it good, notwithstanding his so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory
denying it, as absolutely false.
But in order to the clearing of it, I shall
lay down these Propositions.</p>
            <p>1. That worship is nothing else but an
external signification of honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.
For we do not here speak concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the bare internal acts of the mind; but
of the way whereby the esteem we have in
our minds, is expressed in such a manner as
to give honour to that which we so esteem.</p>
            <p>2. That the signification of honour, which
is due to <hi>God</hi> is not to be measured by the
intentions of men, against the declared will
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:45050:49"/>
of <hi>God.</hi> For, it being in his power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
in what way he will be worshipped,
we are not to enquire, whether men do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
any act of theirs for his honour; but
whether God doth allow it or no? And
herein lyes his great mistake in thinking,
<hi>That mens intentions are to be the rule of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Worship:</hi> so that what they design for
the honour of God, must needs end in it.
Whereas, if <hi>God</hi> hath the power of making
a rule for his own worship, he cannot be
honoured by mens doing any thing against
his declared Will, whatever their intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be. For, then <hi>God</hi> might be honoured
by the most palpable acts of disobedience;
which is a plain contradiction; for what
can be greater dishonour to <hi>God,</hi> than to
break his Laws for his <hi>Honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The Divine Law being the rule of
Worship, all prohibited wayes of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
must receive that <hi>denomination</hi> which
<hi>God</hi> himself gives them. As if a Prince
should declare it by his Laws, to be <hi>Treason</hi>
for any man to bow down to a <hi>Sign-Post</hi>
with his head upon it, under pretence
of giving the greater honour to his Prince;
I desire to know, whether a mans intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of honouring his Prince thereby, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
him from Treason or no? So it is in our
case, if God absolutely prohibits the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of himself by an Image, whatever the
intention of the person be, and calls this
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45050:49"/>
by the name of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> no mans directing
the intention of his mind beyond the
Image, can excuse him from it. From
whence, it necessarily follows, that the
worship of God by an Image, when him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
hath prohibited it, and declared it <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi>
as I shall prove he hath done in the
second Commandment, cannot be termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
on <hi>God,</hi> but only on the Image; for
no man will be so absurd, as to say, that
an act of Idolatry is terminated upon God.
By which we see, how far it is <hi>from the
appearance of a contradiction,</hi> to say that the
worship of <hi>God</hi> by an <hi>Image</hi> being declared
to be <hi>Idolatry</hi> by himself, should be termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
wholly on the creature, (which are
but other words explaining the nature of
Idolatry) and what an easie answer will
take off all his other Instances. For those
do not suppose, <hi>any prohibited object</hi> or
<hi>means</hi> of worship, which is the only thing
we speak of; but either praying to the true
God for bad ends, <hi>as in the case of Thieves
and Murderers praying for good success;</hi> or
bringing something in Sacrifice to him
which he had forbidden, <hi>as the Iews offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the blind and the lame:</hi> or some miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
in the minds of them that sacrifice
or pray to him, as in <hi>Cains oblation, and wicked
mens prayers;</hi> but all these are very remote
from the present debate, concerning an
<hi>object</hi> or <hi>means of worship</hi> prohibited by <hi>God</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:45050:50"/>
himself under the notion of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> This
being cleared, I come to prove,</p>
            <p>§. 4. 2. That God in the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
hath expresly prohibited the
giving any worship to himself by an Image:<note place="margin">Of the meaning of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</note>
and not meerly <hi>giving the worship of God to
Idols,</hi> as he asserts. Our Controversie now
being about the sense of a Law, the best
wayes we have to find out the meaning of
it, are either, from the <hi>terms</hi> wherein it is
expressed, or from the <hi>reason</hi> annexed to
it; or from the <hi>judgement</hi> of those whom
we believe best able to understand and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
it. I shall therefore prove that to
be the meaning of this <hi>Law of God</hi> which
I have set down, from every one of these
wayes.</p>
            <p>1. From the <hi>terms</hi> wherein the Law is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed:
this I the rather insist upon, because
it is the way himself hath chosen: for he
saith, <hi>The Hebrew word</hi> Pesel, <hi>in Latin</hi> Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
<hi>is used in Scripture to signifie an Idol,
and so the LXX. translate it in this place by</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and therefore saith, <hi>it was an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice
of the Protestants to translate it Image
instead of Idol, and not any certain kind of
Image neither, but any whatsoever; Thou shalt
not make to thy self any graven Image, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of, Thou shalt not make to thy self an
Idol.</hi> By his own acknowledgement then,
we are to judge the sense of the <hi>Law,</hi> by
the importance of the words therein used;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:45050:50"/>
but I shall prove, First, That supposing <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel</hi>
did signifie only an <hi>Idol,</hi> yet that were
not enough. Secondly, That <hi>Pesel</hi> is very
properly rendred by the <hi>Protestants,</hi> and that
it doth not signifie barely an <hi>Idol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Supposing that were the signification
of <hi>Pesel</hi> which he contends for, that were
not enough, unless there had been no other
word but that used in the Law: but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
word is added to prevent a mistake
of that nature, of as large a signification as
may be to this purpose: which is, <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muna,</hi>
which they render <hi>similitude</hi> as well
as we, and is never used in the whole Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
to signifie such an <hi>Idol</hi> as he supposes
this Law intends. To what purpose then
are words of the largest signification put
into a <hi>Law;</hi> if the sense be limited ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the most narrow acceptation of
one word mentioned therein? For there is
no kind of Image, whether graven, or
painted, whether of a real or imaginary
being, but is comprehended under the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of the words set down in the
Law: for not only the making a <hi>similitude</hi>
in general, is forbidden, but <hi>any kind of si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
whether of things in Heaven, or
Earth, or under the Earth, to bow down to
them, or worship them.</hi> I confess it cannot
enter into my mind, how <hi>God</hi> should have
forbidden the worship of Images by more
express and emphatical words than he hath
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:45050:51"/>
done; and if he had used any other words,
their sense might as well have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
as these are. If a Prince should un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a very severe penalty forbid all his
subjects making any <hi>Image</hi> or <hi>resemblance,</hi>
with an intent to give honour to him by
kneeling before them; would not that man
be thought very ridiculous, who should
go about to interpret the <hi>Law</hi> thus, that the
Prince did not forbid them making any
<hi>picture</hi> of <hi>himself</hi> or his <hi>Son,</hi> or any of his
<hi>Favourites</hi> (for the worship of these could
not but redound to his own <hi>Honour)</hi> but
only that they should make the Image of
an <hi>Ape,</hi> or an <hi>Ass,</hi> or a <hi>Tyger,</hi> thinking to
honour their Prince thereby? Much such
an exposition is that here given of the Law;
<hi>God</hi> forbids any Image or similitude to be
made with respect to his worship (for it is
ridiculous to imagine the <hi>Law</hi> means any
thing else) but, he saith, <hi>This Law must
not be understood to exclude a Crucifix,</hi> nor
I suppose any Image of <hi>God</hi> himself: (at
least as he appeared of old;) nor <hi>of his Saints
or Angels, with an intention to worship God
by them;</hi> but only they should not worship
<hi>Apis</hi> or <hi>Dagon,</hi> an <hi>Ichneumon</hi> or a <hi>Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile,</hi>
or any of the most ridiculous follies of
the Heathen. If this had been the meaning
of the Law, why was it not more plainly
expressed? Why were none of the words
elsewhere used, by way of contempt of the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:45050:51"/>
               <hi>Heathen Idols</hi> here mentioned, as being less
lyable to ambiguity? Why in so short a
comprehension of <hi>Laws,</hi> is this <hi>Law</hi> so
much inlarged above what it might have
been, if all that he saith, were only meant
by it? For then the meaning of the two
first Precepts might have been summed up
in very few words: <hi>You shall have no other
Gods but me;</hi> and you <hi>shall worship the
Images of no other Gods but me.</hi> This is
his meaning, but far enough from being
that of the <hi>second Commandment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The only word he insists upon which
is <hi>Pesel,</hi> is very properly rendred <hi>an Image,</hi>
and it doth not signifie barely an <hi>Idol:</hi>
the word properly signifies any thing that
is <hi>carved,</hi> or <hi>cut out of wood or stone:</hi> and it
is no less than forty several times rendred
by the <hi>LXX.</hi> by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, yet in the repetition of

               </gap>; from whence it is plain,
that when they translate it by an <hi>Idol,</hi> they
mean no more thereby than a <hi>graven image,</hi>
and <hi>Isa.</hi> 40. 18. they translate it, by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
which is properly an <hi>image;</hi> so that no as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
can be given him by that <hi>translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>

Sculptile</hi> and <hi>Imago,</hi> all to express the
same thing, <hi>Isa.</hi> 44. 9, 10, 13. By which
it appears, that any Image being made so far
the object of Divine Worship, that men do
bow down before it; doth thereby become
an <hi>Idol,</hi> and on that account is forbidden
in this Commandment.</p>
            <p>§. 5. 3. We consider the <hi>reason</hi> given of
this Law,<note place="margin">Of the reason of the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</note> which will more fully explain
the meaning of it; which the <hi>Scripture</hi> tells
us, was derived from <hi>Gods</hi> infinite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible
nature, which could not be
represented to men, but in a way that must
be an infinite disparagement to it.<note place="margin">Isa. 40. 19.</note> 
               <hi>To whom
will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye
compare unto him?</hi>
               <note place="margin">20.</note> 
               <hi>The workman melteth a

               <note place="margin">21.</note> &amp;c. <hi>Have ye not known?
Have ye not heard? Hath it not been told
you from the beginning?</hi>

               <hi>Have ye not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood

he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth,</hi> &amp;c.
I desire to know whether this reason be
given against <hi>Heathen Idols,</hi> or those Images
which were worshipped for <hi>Gods</hi> or no? or
whether, by this reason <hi>God</hi> doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
that all worship given to him by any
visible representation of him, is extreamly
dishonourable to him? And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
when this Precept is enforced on the
people of <hi>Israel</hi> by a very particular cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Deut. 4. 15, 16, &amp;c. <hi>Take ye therefore
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:45050:52"/>
good heed to your selves, lest ye corrupt your
selves and make you a graven Image, the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
of any figure, &amp;c.</hi> the ground of
that caution, is expressed in these words,
<hi>For ye saw no manner of similitude on the
day that the Lord spake unto you.</hi> If the
whole intention of the Law, were only to
keep them from worshipping the <hi>Heathen
Idols,</hi> or <hi>Images for Gods,</hi> to what purpose is
it here mentioned <hi>that they saw no similitude
of God when he spake to them?</hi> For although
<hi>God</hi> appeared with a <hi>similitude</hi> then, yet
there might have been great reason against
Worshipping the <hi>Heathen Idols,</hi> or fixing
the intention of their Worship upon the
<hi>bare Image.</hi> But this was a very great reason,
why they ought not to think of honouring
<hi>God</hi> by an Image; for if he had judged
that, a suitable way of Worship to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and excellency; he would not have
left the choice of the <hi>similitude</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but would have appeared himself in
such a <hi>similitude</hi> as had best pleased him.</p>
            <p>§. 6. From hence the wiser persons of
the <hi>Heathens</hi> themselves condemned the
Worship of <hi>God</hi> by Images,<note place="margin">Of the wiser Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Images.</note> as incongruous
to a Divine <hi>Nature</hi> and a disparagement to

               <note place="margin">Theodoret. c. Graec. Serm. 3. p. 519.</note> So <hi>Theodoret</hi> tells us, that <hi>Zeno</hi>
in his Books of <hi>Government,</hi> did absolutely

And that <hi>Xenophanes Colophonius</hi> derided the

their shape; as the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> and <hi>Thraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>

<hi>That the true God ought not to be represented

<hi>he did forbid all private Images, all Images of

heard of this Law yet judged such a way
of Worship to be wholly unbecoming a

fear lest they should Worship the Images
themselves for <hi>Gods,</hi> which was the reason
of the Commandment, but the incongruity
of such a way of Worship to a being sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be of an infinite and a spiritual

reason why we ought to Worship
him <hi>after a spiritual manner;</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 4. 23, 24.</note> and not by
any <hi>corporeal representation</hi> as the <hi>Iews</hi> say
the <hi>Samaritans</hi> Worshipped <hi>God</hi> in the form
of a <hi>Dove</hi> in their Temple on Mount <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizim:</hi>
in which, notwithstanding what
<hi>Morinus</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Morinus in Pentatench. Samarit.</note> there seems to be no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability
not only from our <hi>Saviours</hi>
words and the occasion of speaking them
to a <hi>Samaritan</hi> woman,<note place="margin">Exerc. 1. S. 9. c. 5.</note> (which we do
not find he insisted on so much to the <hi>Iewes</hi>
as being then free from this kind of <hi>Idolatry)</hi>
and the constant tradition of the <hi>Iewes;</hi>
but from the nature of the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
which they received from the ten
Tribes, which Worshipped <hi>God</hi> under
<hi>Images,</hi> as will appear afterwards, and the
agreeableness of the Symbol of a <hi>Dove</hi> to
the name of <hi>Semiramis</hi> and their <hi>Assyrian</hi>
off-spring among whom the <hi>Dove</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
Sacred. But however this be, since
the reason of this command drawn from
the invisible and spiritual nature of <hi>God,</hi> is
now enforced upon us by the <hi>Gospel</hi> as the
ground of giving <hi>spiritual worship</hi> to God,
how can any men in their senses imagine
that Worship should be lawful among <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
which was unlawful to the <hi>Iewes?</hi>
Is it, that there is now no danger of falling
into <hi>Heathen Idolatry</hi> as there was among
the <hi>Iewes,</hi> on which account <hi>God</hi> tied them
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:45050:55"/>
up so strictly in this point of <hi>Images?</hi> But
this is to begg the Question, and to take it
for granted that there was no other reason
of this command, Whereas <hi>God</hi> himself
hath told us another, and that is, the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity
of it to his infinite nature; which
the very <hi>Heathens</hi> themselves apprehended
in this case. I grant <hi>God</hi> might by this
means design to keep them at the greatest
distance from the <hi>Heathen Idolatry;</hi> but that
doth not hinder, but there was an evil in
the thing it self, as it doth imply so great a
disparagement of the divine nature to be
Worshipped by a corporeal representation.
As we may say that the prohibition of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>Swearing</hi> was intended by <hi>God</hi> to
keep men from <hi>perjury;</hi> but besides that, it
implyes so great an irreverence of <hi>God,</hi> that
it is evil without that further respect. And
can any one imagine there should be
greater irreverence of <hi>God</hi> shewn in calling
him to witness upon every slight occasion,
than there is in bowing down before a
block or a hewn stone representing <hi>God</hi> to
my mind by it? What can such an Image
do to the heightening of devotion, or
raising affections? if it be by calling to my
mind that <hi>Being</hi> I am to Worship, then
there must be supposed some <hi>likeness,</hi> or
<hi>Analogy,</hi> or <hi>Vnion</hi> between the object re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
and the image, every one of
which tends highly to the dishonour of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:45050:55"/>
the <hi>Deity,</hi> and suggests mean thoughts to
us of the <hi>God</hi> we are to Worship. And is
there no danger among Christians that they
should entertain too low and unworthy
thoughts of God? and can any thing tend
to it more effectually, than the bringing
down the representations of him to the
figure and lineaments of a man drawn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Table or carved in an <hi>Image?</hi> On
which account, it seems much more reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for me to Worship <hi>God</hi> by prostrating
my self to the Sun, or any of the Heavenly
bodies, nay to an Ant or a Fly, than to a
picture or an Image: For in the other I
see great evidences of the power, and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and goodness of God, which may
suggest venerable apprehensions of <hi>God</hi> to
my mind; whereas these can have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
worthy admiration, unless it be the
skill of the Painter or Artificer? And I
cannot, for my heart, understand; why I
may not as well, nay better, burn Incense
and say my Prayers to the Sun, having an
intention only to honour the true <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d</hi> by it,
as to do both those to an <hi>Image:</hi> I am
sure the <hi>Sun</hi> hath far more advantages than
any artificial Image can have; the beauty
and influence of it may inflame and warm
ones devotions much more. If the danger be,
that I am more like to take the <hi>Sun</hi> for <hi>God</hi>
than an Image: on that account, that which
deserves most honour should have least
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:45050:56"/>
given it, and that which deserves least
should have most. For the danger is there
still greater, where the excellency is greater,
and by that means we ought rather to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
a beast than a <hi>Saint,</hi> for there is less
danger of believing one to be God than
the other; and so the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> were more
excusable than the <hi>Papists.</hi> I must inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously
confess, if I had been an <hi>Heathen
Idolater,</hi> only upon such principles as these,
that there is one supreme infinite <hi>Being,</hi>
who makes use of some more illustrious
beings of the world, to communicate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
to the rest, on which account, I
thought my self bound to testifie the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
I owe to the supream <hi>Deity,</hi> by paying
my devotions in subordination to him, to
those subservient and ministerial <hi>Gods;</hi> I
should not have been afraid, of what any
<hi>Papists</hi> in the World could have said for my
Confutation. Nay, I should have been
tempted to have laughed at their folly and
despised their weakness, who should plead
for the worship of <hi>God</hi> in or by a dull and
rude image, and condemn me for honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>God</hi> in the most noble parts of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation?
If they had told me, <hi>that the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
God, must have a worship proper to
himself;</hi> Yes, I should answer them in their
own terms, I by no means question it, and
that is it, which is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is
reserved to the supream Deity, all that I
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:45050:56"/>
give to inferiour <hi>Deities,</hi> is but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>Sun</hi> deserved an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, because of
his eminent usefulness. If they had said,
<hi>I made them Gods by giving them religious
Worship:</hi> no more, than they do Images.
If yet they had urged, <hi>that God had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
Worshipping the Host of Heaven;</hi> Yes,
that is, giving the Worship of the Supreme
<hi>God</hi> to them, but not a subordinate relative,
inferiour Worship, which was all I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and I hope they are not so ignorant of
the nature of humane actions as not to
know that they go whither they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended;
and my intent was only to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
the true God by it: or else, that the
Worshipping the Host of Heaven was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
to the dull and stupid <hi>Iewes,</hi> who
had no kind of <hi>Philos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>phy</hi> in them, and did
not see those admirable Images of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
perfections in them which I did; but
for men of Philosophical and contemplative
minds what injury to <hi>God</hi> could there be,
as long as the more I saw cause to honour
these, far greater I still saw to honour him
who produced all these things? or lastly, I
would appeal to themselves whether the
precept against <hi>Worshipping the host of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
or <hi>images</hi> were more plain in the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture?</hi>
the second commandment is not in
words against the Worship of the <hi>things</hi> but
the <hi>images</hi> of them, and the first against
Worshipping them as the <hi>Supream God;</hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:45050:57"/>
I did neither; but they could not possibly
excuse themselves who did the same things
to an Image, which they do to <hi>God</hi> himself.
Thus we see the reason of the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is by no means appropriated to the
<hi>Iews,</hi> but doth extend as far as the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of it doth: and the same arguments
which notwithstanding that command
would justifie the Worship of Images,
will likewise justifie the most early, the
most general, the most lasting <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the
World, which is the Worship of the Sun,
Moon, and Starrs. And a mighty Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that the reason of this command,
drawn from the unsuitableness of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of Images to the nature of God is of
an unalterable and universal nature, is, that
the same reason is urged under the New
Testament against the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</hi>
So St. <hi>Paul</hi> dealt with the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
proving the unreasonableness of their
Worshipping <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Images,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 17. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:45050:57"/>
any resemblance between <hi>God</hi> and their
<hi>Images,</hi> or that he was capable of receiving

               <hi>did

               <note place="margin">23.</note> &amp;c. where
<hi>changing his glory into Images,</hi> is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
opposed to <hi>the glorifying him as God</hi>
in respect of his <hi>eternal power and God-head;</hi>
so that those two are inconsistent with each
other, to <hi>glorifie God</hi> by an <hi>Image</hi> and to
<hi>glorifie him as God.</hi> For here the Apostle
doth not discourse against the most gross
and sottish <hi>Idolaters</hi> of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> but as

Who, though they differed in their opinions

they concurred with them in all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal

therefore the <hi>Apostle</hi> doth not charge them

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:45050:58"/>
whether they were to blame in the manner
of serving <hi>God</hi> by Images in such a way as
they describe? If not, wherefore doth
St. <hi>Paul</hi> pitch upon that, to condemn them
for, which they were not at all to blame
in? He ought to have done as the <hi>Iesuits</hi>
in <hi>China</hi> did, who never condemned the
people for worshipping Images, but for
worshipping false <hi>Gods</hi> by them; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded

               <note place="margin">Trirant. de Christian. Expedit. apud Sinas, l. 5. c. 16. p. 588.</note> and so melted down their former
Images, and made new ones of them. Can
we imagine St. <hi>Paul</hi> meant the same thing,
when he blames men not for believing
them to be <hi>Gods,</hi> but that <hi>God</hi> could be
worshipped <hi>by the work of mens hands;</hi>
and for <hi>changing thereby the glory due to

<hi>Bellarmins</hi> answer: as though ever any men
were such fools to believe an Image could
perfectly represent an infinite Being; or,
that <hi>God</hi> need to make a Law to forbid
that, which is utterly impossible in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
nature of the thing; he might more
reasonably forbid men to paint a sound,
to grasp all the Air in the hollow of their
hands, to drink up the Ocean, to wear
the <hi>Sun</hi> for a <hi>Pendant</hi> at their ears, or to
make new worlds, than to command them
not to make any Image which should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly

urge, <q>That the <hi>Devil</hi> now not being able
to reduce the world to the former <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>
endeavours under hand to introduce
it, under a pretence of <hi>Christianity,</hi> bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them again to the worship of the
creature, and making a <hi>God</hi> of a thing
that is made, when they have called it
by the name of <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </q> These answer,
<hi>That it is true, the Fathers used that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:45050:61"/>
against the</hi> Arrians, <hi>who supposed Christ
to be a Creature, and they grant that they
were guilty of Idolatry in giving Divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to Christ, when they believed him to be a
creature; but the difference lyes herein, that
the</hi> Arrians <hi>trusted in Christ, and gave pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
divine honour to him, which they say,
they did not to the Images, but only worshipped
them for the sake of the object represented by
them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aquinas Summ. p. 3. q. 25. art. 3.</note> But <hi>Aquinas</hi> and his followers have
at large proved, that where any thing is
worshipped, meerly for the sake of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it must have the same kind of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
given it, which they give to the thing
represented by it: for as <hi>Aquinas</hi> observes,
the motion of the soul towards an Image is
twofold: either as it is a thing, or as it is an
Image: the first, he saith is distinct from that
motion which respects the object; but the
second is the same; so that to the Image
of <hi>Christ,</hi> as made of <hi>Wood or Stone,</hi> no wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
at all is given: and therefore it being
given meerly on the account of its being
an Image, it necessarily follows, that the
same worship must be given to the Image,
which is given to <hi>Christ</hi> himself. And so
they are in the same case with the <hi>Arrians,</hi>
whom they acknowledge to be <hi>Idolaters;</hi>
notwithstanding their <hi>Christianity,</hi> or <hi>that
the gifts and graces of God are without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi>
Besides the <hi>Constantinopolitan Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
urge <q>The great absurdity of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:45050:62"/>
making an Image of <hi>Christ,</hi> for worship;
because <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>God and Man,</hi> therefore
the Image must be of <hi>God and Man,</hi> which
cannot be, unless the <hi>Deity</hi> be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
within the created flesh, or there
be a confusion of both natures after their
union, both which are blasphemies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by the <hi>Church.</hi>
               </q> The <hi>Nicene Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
in answer to this yield, <hi>That the Name
Christ is significative of both natures, and
that an Image can only represent the visible hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature, and that it agrees only in name,
and not in substance with the thing represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi>
and after many reviling expressions
against their adversaries, (no argument of
the goodness of their cause) they say, <hi>that
if the Divine nature were circumscribed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the humane nature in the Cradle, and on
the Cross, then it is in an image, if not in
one, neither is it in the other.</hi> But what
doth this answer signifie, unless there be
an equal presence and union of the Divine
nature of Christ with the Image, as there
was with the humane nature? Which uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
was the reason of the <hi>adoration</hi> given
to the <hi>person</hi> of <hi>Christ;</hi> and what ground
can there be then of giving divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to the Image of <hi>Christ,</hi> unless the same
<hi>union</hi> be supposed? If the humane nature
without the union of the <hi>divine,</hi> could
yield us no sufficient reason of divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
being given to it, how much less can
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:45050:62"/>
an Image deserve it, which can only at the
best represent but the external lineaments
of that humane nature? And if the divine
nature be supposed united with the <hi>Image,</hi>
then the same divine honour is due to the
Image of <hi>Christ,</hi> which is to <hi>God</hi> himself,
which yet these <hi>Nicene Fathers</hi> deny: and
the Image then joyned with the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is as proper an object of divine
worship without respect to any <hi>Prototype,</hi>
as the person of <hi>Christ</hi> is consisting of the
divine and humane nature. Again, they
urge, <q>If the humane nature of <hi>Christ</hi> be
represented in the Image of <hi>Christ</hi> to be
worshipped as separate from the divine,
this would be plain <hi>Nestorianism.</hi>
               </q> To
this the good <hi>Nicene Fathers,</hi> not knowing
what to answer, plainly deny the conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and cry, <hi>They Nestorians? No, they lye
in their teeth; they were no more</hi> Nestorians
<hi>than themselves, nor so much neither:</hi> And
now, good men, they say, <hi>It is true, they do
represent Christ only by his humane nature in
an Image; and when they look on Images, they
understand nothing but what is signified by
them; as when the birth of the Virgin is
represented, they conceive in their minds, that
he who was born, was truly God as well as
man.</hi> Alas for them! that they should ever
be charged with the worship of Images!
They plead for nothing now, but a help
to their profound Meditations by them.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:45050:63"/>
But the Controversie was about worship,
what ever they think; and their Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
argument did not lye in the Images be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
considered as an object of <hi>perception,</hi>
but of <hi>worship: i. e.</hi> if the Image can only
represent the humane nature of <hi>Christ,</hi> as
separate from the divine; and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
be an <hi>object of worship</hi> to us, then the
charge of <hi>Nestorianism</hi> follows; but this
they very wisely pass by; and their distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of <hi>the Image from the principal,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
serve their turn, since the <hi>Image</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the worship due to the <hi>principal,</hi>
must have not only the <hi>name,</hi> (as they
say) but the <hi>reason</hi> of <hi>worship</hi> common
with the <hi>principal</hi> which it represents. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this, the <hi>Fathers</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to another Argument, which is, <q>That
all the representation of <hi>Christ</hi> allowed
us by the <hi>Gospel,</hi> is that which <hi>Christ</hi>
himself instituted, in the <hi>Elements</hi> of the
<hi>Lords Supper,</hi> whose use was to put us
in remembrance of <hi>Christ.</hi> No other
Figure or Type being chosen by <hi>Christ</hi>
as able to represent his being in the flesh,
but this. This was an <hi>honourable Image</hi>
of his quickning <hi>body,</hi> made by himself,
<hi>say they;</hi> which he would not have of
the shape of a man to prevent <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;</hi>
but of a common nature, as he took
upon him the common nature of man,
and not any individuated person; and as
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:45050:63"/>
the <hi>body</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> was really sanctified by
the divine nature; so by institution this
holy Image is made divine through san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification
by Grace.</q> Here the <hi>Nicene
Council</hi> quarrels with them, <hi>for calling the
Eucharist an Image, contrary,</hi> as they say, <hi>to
the Scriptures and Fathers;</hi> but they are as
much to be believed therein, as in their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
proofs, that the worship of Images
was the constant doctrine of the <hi>Church;</hi>
and having strenuously denyed this, they
suppose that to be enough to answer the
argument.</p>
            <p>Besides these particular arguments against
the <hi>Images</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi>
useth many more against the <hi>Images</hi>
of any other, <q>Because these being the
chief, there can be less reason for any
other besides, that there is no tradition
of <hi>Christ</hi> or his <hi>Apostles,</hi> or the primitive
<hi>Fathers</hi> for them, no way of consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them prescribed or practised, no
suitableness in the use of them to the
design of <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> which being
in the middle between <hi>Iudaism</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganism,</hi>
it casts off the Sacrifices of the
one, and not only the <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> but all
the <hi>Idolatries</hi> of the other: and it is
blasphemy to the <hi>Saints</hi> in Heaven, to
call in the <hi>Heathen</hi> superstitions into
<hi>Christianity,</hi> to honour them by: that it
is unbecoming their glory in Heaven, to be
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:45050:64"/>
set up on earth in dull and sensless Images;
that Christ himself would not receive te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
from <hi>Devils,</hi> though they spake
truth; neither can such a <hi>Heathenish</hi>
custome be acceptable to the <hi>Saints</hi> in
<hi>Heaven</hi> though pretended to be for their
honour. That nothing can be plainer in
the <hi>Gospel,</hi> than that <hi>God is a Spirit,</hi> and
will be worshipped in <hi>Spirit and in truth;</hi>
to which nothing can be more contrary,
than the going about to honour <hi>God</hi> by
worshipping any Image of himself, or his
<hi>Saints.</hi>
               </q> These and many other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
from the <hi>Scriptures</hi> and <hi>Fathers,</hi> that
<hi>Council</hi> insists upon, to shew the incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity
of the worship of <hi>Images,</hi> to the nature
of God, and the design of the <hi>Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi>
to which the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
very weak and trivial answers, as
shall more largely appear, if any one thinks
good to defend them. And we have this
apparent advantage on our side, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the <hi>Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> sided with these
worshippers of <hi>Images,</hi> yet the <hi>Council</hi> at
<hi>Francford</hi> condemned it, called together
by <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Great:</hi> Not out of misun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
their Doctrine, as some vainly

               <hi>because</hi> as <hi>Vasquez</hi> well proves, the
Copy of the <hi>Nicene Council</hi> was sent to them
by <hi>Pope Adrian, because</hi> the <hi>Acts</hi> of that
<hi>Council</hi> were very well known to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:45050:64"/>
under the name of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, and
published by <hi>du Tillet</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> about the
middle of the last Century; which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by their learnedst men to have
been written at the same time; <hi>because</hi>
the <hi>Popes Legats Theophylactus</hi> and <hi>Stepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
were present, and might easily rectifie
any mistake, if they were guilty of it; and
none of the <hi>Historians</hi> of that time do take
notice of any such <hi>error</hi> among them. But
<hi>Vasquez</hi> runs into another strange mistake
himself, that the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Francford</hi> did
not condemn that of <hi>Nice,</hi> which is evident
they did, expresly by the second <hi>Canon</hi> of
of that <hi>Council</hi> published by <hi>Sirmondus.</hi>

from which he published them, and from

proceeded upon a mistake of the
meaning of it; when it so distinctly relates
and punctually answers the several places
of <hi>Scriptures</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> produced by it for
the worship of Images. In the first Book
an answer is given to many impertinent
places of the Old Testament alledged in
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:45050:65"/>
that <hi>Council;</hi> which the second proceeds
with, and examines several testimonies of
the <hi>Fathers;</hi> and in the two remaining
Books pursues all their pretences with that
diligence, that no one can imagine all this
while that the Author did not know their
meaning. And that by <hi>adoration</hi> he means
no more than giving <hi>Religious Worship</hi> to
<hi>Images</hi> appears from hence, because he
calls the Civil worship which men give to
one another, by the name of <hi>adoration:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Caroli liber de Imag. l. 2. c. 24.</note>
when he shewes, <hi>that</hi> it is another thing to
give <hi>adoration</hi> to a man upon a <hi>civil respect,</hi>
and to give <hi>adoration</hi> to <hi>Images</hi> upon a
<hi>religious account,</hi> when <hi>God</hi> challenges all
<hi>religious worship</hi> or <hi>adoration</hi> to himself:
and whatever reason will hold for such a
worship of <hi>Images</hi> will much more hold for
the worship of <hi>men,</hi> who have greater
excellency in them, and more honour put
upon them by <hi>God,</hi> than any Images can
ever pretend to.<note place="margin">Cap. 25.</note> That <hi>God</hi> allows no other
kind of adoration to be given to any but
himself, but that which we give to one
another. Can any be so senseless to think,
that by this <hi>civil adoration,</hi> he meant, we
honoured every man we met as our <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Prince?</hi> And as little reason is there
to say, that by <hi>adoration</hi> given to Images, he
meant only the incommunicable worship
due only to <hi>God,</hi> in the sense of those <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Can we imagine,</hi> saith he, <hi>that
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:45050:66"/>
S.</hi> Peter <hi>would allow the worship of Images,
who forbad</hi> Cornelius <hi>to worship him? Or
St.</hi> John <hi>whom the Angel checked for offering
to worship him, and bid him give that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to God? Or</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas, <hi>who
with such horror ran among the men of</hi> Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caonia
<hi>when they were about to worship them;
and yet, surely Angels and such persons as
these deserved more to be worshipped than any
Images can do. But we see by these examples,
that even these are not to be adored with any
other kind of adoration, than what the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of civility require from us.</hi> Besides in

<hi>thing</hi> did imply? Whether that <hi>religious

of that <hi>adoration</hi> which was only due to
God? And he that expects an answer to
this from him, will find himself deceived;
who is so pitifully put to it for an answer

               <note place="margin">C. 36.</note> that

passages of <hi>Dionysius</hi> the supposed <hi>Areopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gite,</hi>
wherein the word <hi>Image</hi> hapning to
be, is very sufficient to his purpose. And
this answer of <hi>Hadrians</hi> gave so little sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to the <hi>Western Bishops,</hi> that
<hi>A.D.</hi> 824. the <hi>Synod</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> being called
by <hi>Ludovicus Pius</hi> to advise about this
point,<note place="margin">Delaland Supplem. Concil. Gall. p. 109.</note> did condemn expressely <hi>Pope Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi>
for asserting a <hi>superstitious adoration
of Images;</hi> which they look on as a <hi>great
impiety:</hi> and say that he produces very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
places of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and remote
from his purpose; and that setting aside
his <hi>Pontifical authority</hi> in his answer to the
<hi>Caroline Books,</hi> there were some things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
false: and they have nothing to
excuse him by, but his <hi>Ignorance.</hi> And
therefore they at large shew, that the <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
worship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> came first from
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:45050:67"/>
               <hi>Hereticks;</hi> and that it was alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Christian
Church:</hi> and answer the arguments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
on the other side out of the Writings
of the <hi>Fathers.</hi> And supposing that super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious
custome of worshipping Images, had
for some time obtained, yet they shew by
several testimonies, that it ought to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated.<note place="margin">Bellarm. Append. ad. lib. de cultu Imag. c. 3.</note>
No wonder then that <hi>Bellarmine</hi>

words, wherein he disowns <hi>the give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
true divine honour to Images.</hi> Not long
after this <hi>Synod</hi> came forth the Book of

<hi>Images,</hi> occasioned saith <hi>Papirius Massonus,
by the stupendous superstition in that Age in
the worship of them.</hi> And this, saith he,
is the substance of his Doctrine out of
St. <hi>Augustine</hi> and other <hi>Fathers, that</hi> there
is no other Image of <hi>God,</hi> but what is
himself, and therefore cannot be painted,
and he ought not to be worshipped in any
Image, but what he hath prescribed us to
worship, which is <hi>Christ; that adoration</hi> is
external or internal; <hi>that,</hi> both of them
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:45050:67"/>
are called <hi>Religion,</hi> by which we are bound
eternally to <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>only</hi> to him: from
whence it follows, that neither <hi>Angels</hi> nor
<hi>Saints</hi> are to be worshipped by any <hi>religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
worship:</hi> for this is the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
that no creature, no phantasm of <hi>God</hi>
in our minds, no work of mens hands
ought to be worshipped: for if <hi>Gods</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are not to be worshipped, much less
ours, such as <hi>Images</hi> of <hi>God, Angels</hi> and
<hi>Saints</hi> are. Neither is it enough to say,
that they do not worship the <hi>Image,</hi> but the
<hi>thing</hi> represented; for the object termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
the worship, and it is a deceit of the
<hi>Devil</hi> under the pretence of honouring the
<hi>Saints,</hi> to bring mens minds to <hi>Idols,</hi> and
from the true <hi>God</hi> to carnal things: <hi>that
Images</hi> are to be used only for shew and
memory, and not at all for <hi>Religion;</hi> that
<hi>God</hi> alone is to be worshipped with all <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
worship,</hi> whether called <hi>Latria</hi> or
<hi>Doulia,</hi> or what name soever, and for the
casting away all superstition, that no <hi>Images</hi>
be painted in <hi>Churches,</hi> no <hi>Statues</hi> erected,
nor accounted holy, that the <hi>true God</hi> may
be worshipped alone, for ever. This is the
abstract of his Doctrine delivered by <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonus,</hi>
whose other Writings shew he was
far from being partial towards the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</hi>
And the Book it self is lately
published by <hi>Baluzius</hi> again, where any
one may easily satisfie himself concerning
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:45050:68"/>
fidelity.<note place="margin">Agobardi opera p. 221. Ed. 1666.</note> But <hi>Baluzius</hi> very honestly tells
us, some have suspected this Book not to
be very <hi>Catholick:</hi> and therefore it was
censured by <hi>Baronius</hi> and the <hi>Spanish Index;</hi>
yet he ingenuously confesseth, he saith no
more than the whole <hi>Gallican Church</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
in that <hi>Age. What</hi> that was, I have
already shewed. This I have the larger
insisted upon, to shew, that it is no new
thing for us to plead for all <hi>Religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>
being appropriated to <hi>God,</hi> and that the
command against <hi>Image-worship</hi> was no
Ceremonial <hi>Law</hi> respecting meerly the
<hi>Iews,</hi> but that the reason of it doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to all <hi>Ages</hi> and Nations, and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to us who live under the <hi>Gospel.</hi> From
all which it follows, that it was not meerly
the <hi>Heathen Idolatry</hi> which was forbidden
by God, nor barely to prevent their fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to that by degrees, but the giving to
himself such a worship; which he judges
so unworthy of him.</p>
            <p>§. 10. 3. From those who were best
able to <hi>understand</hi> the meaning of it.<note place="margin">Of the Scripture Instances of Idolatry contrary to the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</note> We
can imagine none so competent a Judge of
the meaning of a <hi>Law,</hi> as the <hi>giver</hi> of it,
and what he afterwards declares to be the
sense of this Law. The first occasion given
for knowing the meaning of the <hi>Law</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Images, was not long after the
making of it, when upon <hi>Moses</hi> his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
they compelled <hi>Aaron</hi> to make them
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:45050:68"/>
a <hi>Golden Calf, Exod.</hi> 32. 4. Here was an
<hi>Image</hi> made contrary to the <hi>Law,</hi> as is on
all sides acknowledged; but the question
is, Whether by this the <hi>Israelites</hi> did fall
into the <hi>Heathen Idolatry,</hi> or only worship
the true <hi>God</hi> under that <hi>Symbol</hi> of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence?
That they did not herein fall back
to the <hi>Heathen Idolatry,</hi> I thus prove:
1. From the <hi>occasion</hi> of it, which was not
upon the least pretence of <hi>Infidelity</hi> as to
the true <hi>God,</hi> or that they had now better
reason given them <hi>for the worship of other
Gods besides him;</hi> but all they say, was,
<hi>that</hi> Moses <hi>had been so long absent, they
knew not what was become of him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they say to</hi> Aaron, <hi>make us Gods</hi> (or
<hi>a God,</hi> as in <hi>Nehem. 9. 18.) to go before us.</hi>
We cannot imagine the people so sottish; to
desire <hi>Aaron</hi> to make them a <hi>God</hi> in the
proper sense, as though they could believe
the <hi>Calf</hi> newly made, to have been the
<hi>God,</hi> which before it was made, <hi>brought
them out of the Land of Aegypt</hi> as they say
afterwards, <hi>v.</hi> 4. but it must be understood
as the <hi>symbol</hi> of that <hi>God</hi> which did bring
them from thence: the controversie then
lyes here, Whether they thought the <hi>Aegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptian
Gods</hi> delivered them out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
while they forsook all their own worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
to preserve those who were so great
enemies to them, that their very <hi>way</hi> of <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>
was an <hi>abomination to all the Aegyptians,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:45050:69"/>
Exod,</hi> 8. 26. and whether they could think <hi>the
Gods of Aegypt</hi> had wrought all the Miracles
for them in their deliverance and after it?
Whether they appeared not long before on
<hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> and delivered the <hi>Law</hi> to
them? Or, whether it were not the true <hi>God</hi>
they meant, who had made that the Preface
to his <hi>Laws, I am the God that brought thee
out of the Land of Aegypt;</hi> to whom they
intended still to give honour: but the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
question was concerning the <hi>symbol</hi> of
his presence, that was to go before them.
For which, we are to consider, that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
before <hi>Moses</hi> his going up into the
Mount, the last promise <hi>God</hi> made to them
was, <hi>that he would send his Angel before
them, Exod.</hi> 23. 20, 23. which is elsewhere
called <hi>his presence, Exod.</hi> 33. 14. Moreover,
they understood that there should be some
extraordinary <hi>symbol</hi> of this presence; but
what it was, they could not tell; for <hi>Moses</hi>
was then gone into the Mount to learn: but
he not being heard of in forty dayes, they
took it for granted, he was not to be heard
of more; therefore they fall upon devising
among themselves what was the fittest <hi>sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol</hi>
for the presence of <hi>God</hi> going before
them; and herein the greatest number be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
possessed with the prejudices of their
education in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> where <hi>golden Bulls</hi> were
the symbols of their chief <hi>God Osiris,</hi> they
pitch upon that, and force <hi>Aaron</hi> to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:45050:69"/>
with them in it. 2. There is no
intimation given in the whole story, that
they fell into the <hi>Heathen Idolatry;</hi> for when
afterwards they fell into it, the particular
names of the <hi>Gods</hi> are mentioned, as <hi>Baal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peor,
Moloch, Remphan. Numb. 25. 3. Acts</hi>
7. 43. But here, on the contrary, <hi>Aaron</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
proclaims <hi>a Feast to the Lord, Exod.</hi>
32. 5. and the people accordingly met and
offered their accustomed offerings, <hi>v.</hi> 6.
whereas if it had been the <hi>Aegyptian Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>
their common Sacrifices were abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
they must not have sacrificed <hi>Sheep</hi>
and <hi>Oxen,</hi> as they were wont to do. And
that it was not the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
who worshipped <hi>the Host of Heaven,</hi>
is plain from <hi>St. Stephens words,</hi> Acts 7.
41, 42. <hi>And they made a Calf in those dayes,
and offered Sacrifice unto Idols, and rejoyced
in the works of their own hands; then God
turned and gave them up to worship the Host
of Heaven.</hi> Whereby it is both observable
that the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the <hi>Calf</hi> was distinct
from the other <hi>Heathen Idolatry,</hi> this being
a punishment of the other; and withal
though the <hi>Calf</hi> was intended by them,
to be only a symbol of <hi>Gods</hi> presence, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
directly against <hi>Gods Command,</hi> and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
divine worship given it, it is by <hi>S. Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi>
called an <hi>Idol;</hi> and to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks, <hi>They made a Calf
in</hi> Horeb, <hi>and worshipped the Molten Image;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:45050:70"/>
thus they changed their glory</hi> (or rather <hi>his)
into the similitude of an Oxe that eateth
grass,</hi> Psal. 106. 19, 20. Which certainly
was <hi>Idolatry</hi> as well as that St. <hi>Paul</hi> charges
the Romans with, viz. <hi>that they changed the
glory of the incorruptible God into an image
made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and
four footed beasts, and creeping things,</hi>
Rom. 1. 23. And we see how highly <hi>God</hi>
was displeased with the <hi>Israelites</hi> for this
sin of the <hi>golden Calf,</hi> Exod. 32. 7, 8,
9, 10.</p>
            <p>The same may be said of the <hi>two Calves</hi>
of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel;</hi> for it was
neither agreeable to his end, nor so likely
to succeed, to take the <hi>ten Tribes</hi> off from
the <hi>Worship</hi> of the true <hi>God;</hi> but only
from the place of it at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and the
occasion of the <hi>Kingdomes</hi> coming to him
was from <hi>Solomons</hi> falling to <hi>Heathen Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi>
1 King. 11. 33. Which would make
him more Cautious of falling into it, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
at his first entrance: And when the
<hi>Gods</hi> of other Nations are mentioned, they
are particularly described, as <hi>Ashtoreth</hi> of the
<hi>Zidonians, Chemosh</hi> of the <hi>Moabites,</hi> and
<hi>Milcom</hi> of the <hi>Children of Ammon,</hi> 1 Kings
11. 33. And in <hi>Ahabs Idolatry,</hi> the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and description of it is given, 1 <hi>Kings</hi>
16. 31. But of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> it is only said <hi>that
he set up the Calves at</hi> Dan <hi>and</hi> Bethel, <hi>and
said unto the people, It is too much for you to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:45050:70"/>
go up to</hi> Hierusalem, <hi>behold thy Gods O Israel
which brought thee up out of the Land of</hi>
Aegypt, 1 Kings 12. 28, 29. How easie had
it been to have said that <hi>Ieroboam</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
the <hi>Gods</hi> of <hi>Aegypt</hi> if that had
been his intention! but, how much better
had <hi>he</hi> then argued, that they had been
hitherto in a great mistake concerning the
<hi>true God,</hi> and not meerly as to the place of
his Worship, which is all he speaks against:
for he continued the same Feasts and way
of Worship, which were at <hi>Hierusalem,
1 King.</hi> 12. 32. Besides, how comes the sin
of <hi>Ahab</hi> to be so much greater than that of
<hi>Ieroboam,</hi> if they were both guilty of the
same <hi>Apostasie</hi> to <hi>Heathen Idolatry, 1 Kings
16. 31.?</hi> how came the Worship of the true
<hi>God</hi> in the Ten Tribes to be set in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to <hi>Heathen Idolatry, 1 Kings 18. 21?</hi>
how comes <hi>Iehu</hi> at the same time, to boast
<hi>his zeal for his Lord,</hi> when it is said of him,
<hi>that he departed not from the sins of</hi> Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,
viz. <hi>the golden Calves of</hi> Dan <hi>and</hi>
Bethel, 2 <hi>Kings 10. 16, 29?</hi> Lastly, how
comes the Worship of the true <hi>God</hi> to be
preserved in the Ten Tribes after their
captivity, when they still continued their
separation in <hi>Religion,</hi> from the <hi>Kingdom</hi>
of <hi>Iudah, 2 Kings 17. 28?</hi> For, certainly,
if the <hi>Samaritans</hi> had only desired infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
concerning the Worship of the <hi>God</hi>
of <hi>Israel</hi> after the way of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> they
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:45050:71"/>
would have sent only thither for it; but
because they sent into the <hi>Land</hi> of their
<hi>Captivity,</hi> for a <hi>Priest</hi> to be sent to them;
it is plain the former differences still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
and yet it is said <hi>he taught them to
fear the Lord.</hi> And notwithstanding it be
thus evident that <hi>Ieroboam</hi> did not fall
then into <hi>Heathen Idolatry,</hi> yet we see that
he is charged with <hi>Idolatry</hi> in Scripture;
for it is said, <hi>that he had done evil above all
that were before him, and had gone and
made him other Gods and Molten Images to
provoke God to anger, and had cast him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
his back,</hi> 1 Kings 14. 9. From whence
it necessarily follows, that if <hi>God</hi> may be
allowed to interpret his own <hi>Law,</hi> the
Worshipping of <hi>Images</hi> though designed
for his honour is <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And since the <hi>Lawgiver</hi> hath thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
his own <hi>Law,</hi> we need not be
solicitous about the sense of any others;
yet herein we have the concurrence of the
<hi>Iewish</hi> and <hi>Christian Church:</hi> the <hi>Iews</hi>
have thought the prohibition to extend to
all kinds of <hi>Images</hi> for Worship, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all for <hi>ornament:</hi> and the Image Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is one of the
great scandals to this day which hinder
them from embracing <hi>Christianity.</hi> The
primitive <hi>Christians</hi> were declared enemies
to all Worship of <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Images;</hi> but I
need the less to go about to prove it now,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:45050:71"/>
since it is at last consessed by one of the
most learned <hi>Iesuites</hi> they ever had, that,
<hi>for the four first Centuries and further there
was little or no use of Images in the Temples
or Oratories of Christians;</hi>

since in his latter Writings, he reckons up
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:45050:72"/>
the Commandments as others of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>

doth it thence follow that this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
must be only against <hi>Idols?</hi> no, but
that all things concerning the Worship of
<hi>God</hi> must be in one command and so they
may be, and yet be as full against <hi>Image
Worship,</hi> as in <hi>two:</hi> so, that no relief is to
be had from hence.</p>
            <p>And as little from his distinction <hi>of an
inferiour and relative honour only which is
given by them</hi> (he saith) <hi>to the Sacred
Images of Christ and his B. Mother and Saints,
and that which they call</hi> Latria <hi>or Worship
due to God; the former</hi> he saith <hi>is only hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
adoration expressed by putting off our Hats,
kissing them or kneeling before them.</hi> Which
is just as if an unchaste Wife should plead
in her excuse to her Husband, that the
person she was too kind with, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
like him, and a near friend of his,
and that it was out of respect to him that
she gave him the honour of his bed; Can
any one think that such an excuse as this
would be taken by a jealous Husband?
How much less will such like pretences avail
with that God who hath declared himself
particularly <hi>jealous</hi> of his honour, in this
Command above others, and that <hi>he will
not give his glory to another;</hi> but hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
all <hi>divine worship</hi> as peculiar to

himself; and no such fond excuses of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative,
inferiour,</hi> and <hi>improper Worship</hi> will
serve, when they encroach upon his prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative.
It was well observed by a very
learned <hi>Bishop</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> that such kind
of distinctions so applyed are like the
dispute among some of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>
in <hi>Scotland,</hi>

and very subtilly, that <hi>ultimately,
principally, primarily</hi> and <hi>strictly</hi> they might
not; but <hi>secondarily, less principally</hi> and
<hi>largely</hi> or <hi>relatively</hi> they might. The same
would certainly hold for Images too. And
I wonder very much they stick at any kind
of Worship to be done to <hi>Images;</hi> for my
own part, were I of their mind, I should as
little scruple offering up the <hi>Host</hi> to an
<hi>Image,</hi> as saying my <hi>Prayers</hi> to it; and I
should think my self hardly dealt with if I
did not come off with the same distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
For if I do it to <hi>God absolutely</hi> and
for <hi>himself,</hi> and to the Image only <hi>improperly</hi>
and <hi>relatively,</hi> wherein I am to blame? I
cannot understand if the Image have the
<hi>honorary adoration</hi> as he calls it given to it,
only with a respect to what is represented
by it, but I may give the same kind of
Worship to the Image which I do to the
<hi>Prototype:</hi> and that, upon the rule he quotes
from St. <hi>Basil</hi> (although he uses it quite
upon another occasion, as if he looks upon
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:45050:73"/>
the place he may see) <hi>that the Worship of
the Image is carryed to the Prototype or thing
represented.</hi> I desire therefore seriously to
know of him, whether any <hi>Worship</hi> doth at
all belong to the <hi>image</hi> or no? if none at
all, to what end are they <hi>kneeled before,</hi> and
<hi>kissed,</hi> which if the Images had any sense
in them, would think was done to them?
and why doth the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
that <hi>due worship</hi> is to be given them?
if there be any <hi>due,</hi> whether it be the <hi>same</hi>

from it? if it be the <hi>same</hi> then <hi>proper di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Worship</hi> is given to the <hi>Image;</hi> if <hi>distinct</hi>
then the <hi>Image</hi> is Worshipped with <hi>divine

<hi>Latria,</hi> (or <hi>Divine Worship,)</hi> to be given
<hi>for it self:</hi> for, that is the Worship,
which is due to the true <hi>God</hi> as the first
principle of all things, and it implyes a
contradiction for the highest Worship to
be given to the first principle and <hi>relative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
or for another; and therefore this
worship is given to the Image for it self,
which is plain <hi>Idolatry,</hi> or else it is not
given for it self, and then it is not <hi>Latria</hi>
or properly Divine Worship. Again, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Divine Worship, or <hi>Latria,</hi>
which is given to the Image relatively for
another is the same with that which is
given to <hi>God,</hi> or an inferiour Worship;
if it be the same, the Creature is equally
Worshipped with <hi>God,</hi> which certainly
is <hi>Idolatry;</hi> For <hi>Idolatry,</hi> saith he, <hi>is not
only when God is forsaken, and an Idol
Worshipped; but when an Idol is Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
together with God.</hi> If it be an <hi>inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi>
worship, then it is not <hi>Latria,</hi> for that is
the highest Worship.</q> Thus far <hi>Bellarmin;</hi>

it incurres the <hi>crime of Idolatry;</hi> for he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth

               <hi>as he fancies them;
such as,</hi> the honour given to the Chair of State,
or the Kings picture or garment, <hi>Moses</hi> and
<hi>Joshua</hi>'s putting off their Shooes because it
was holy ground, the Iews falling down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Gods footstool, and Worshipping the Holy
of Holies, where were the Cherubims, Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory,
and Ark, Protestants bowing at the
name of Iesus, or kneeling at the Eucharist,
and bowing before the Altar; <hi>from these he
thinks he hath sufficiently cleared, that</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
<hi>and</hi> relative <hi>Worship which they
give to Images. To which I answer,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>To that of the Chair of State;</hi> that
our dispute is not concerning <hi>Civil Worship,</hi>
but <hi>Divine;</hi> and as <hi>to civil worship;</hi> I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
he would not say that were any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to the <hi>King</hi> in case he had absolutely
<hi>forbidden it,</hi> as we have proved <hi>God</hi> hath
done in the case of <hi>Images.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:45050:74"/>
2. <hi>To the putting off the Shooes upon holy
ground:</hi> (1.) That we think there is some
little difference to be made between what
<hi>God</hi> hath <hi>commanded,</hi> and what he hath
<hi>forbidden;</hi> for in the case of <hi>Moses</hi> and
<hi>Ioshua,</hi> there was an <hi>express command,</hi>
Exod. 3. 5. Josh. 5. 15. but in the case of
Image Worship there is as plain a <hi>prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
(2.) That the special presence and
appearance of <hi>God</hi> doth <hi>sanctifie</hi> a place to
so high a degree, that we may lawfully
testifie our reverence towards it; but this
will not hold for Images, unless <hi>God</hi> be
proved present in them in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as he appeared to <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and
yet even then the reverence he required,
was not <hi>kissing it,</hi> or <hi>bowing to it,</hi> much
less <hi>praying</hi> to it, but only <hi>putting off their
Shooes.</hi> (3.) If these things had been
done towards the <hi>ground,</hi> the danger had
not been so great as to <hi>Images,</hi> because the
<hi>ground</hi> had nothing of <hi>representation</hi> in it,
but was only <hi>Sacred</hi> by <hi>Divine consecration;</hi>
and therefore it could not pretend to be
any <hi>similitude</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> But in <hi>Images</hi> there
is nothing <hi>Sacred,</hi> but being an <hi>Image,</hi> and
so the <hi>representation</hi> is that, which gives all
the excellency and value to it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Reverence</hi> of holy places and things,
is of quite a different nature from the <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>
of <hi>Images.</hi>

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:45050:75"/>
Ark and the Holy of Holies, where the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims
and Propitiatory were:</hi> (1.) That
they only directed their Worship <hi>towards
the place,</hi> where <hi>God</hi> had promised to be
<hi>signally present</hi> among them; and signifies
no more to the Worship of <hi>Images</hi> than
our lifting <hi>our eyes to Heaven,</hi> doth when
we pray, because <hi>God</hi> is more especially
present there. (2.) That though the
<hi>Cherubims</hi> were there, yet they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
hid from the sight of the people,
the <hi>High-Priest</hi> himself going into the
<hi>Holy of Holies</hi> but once a year; that the
<hi>Cherubims</hi> were no <hi>representations</hi> of <hi>God;</hi>
and his Throne was <hi>between them</hi> upon the
<hi>mercy seat;</hi> and were <hi>Hieroglyphical figures</hi>
of <hi>Gods</hi> own appointing which the <hi>Iews</hi>
know no more than we do: which are
plain arguments they were never intended
for <hi>objects of Worship;</hi> for then they must
not have been meerly <hi>appendices</hi> to another
thing, they must have been publickly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
as the <hi>Images</hi> are in the <hi>Roman
Churches,</hi> and their form as well known as
any of the <hi>B. Virgin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>To bowing at the name of Iesus;</hi> that
he might as well have instanced in going
to <hi>Church</hi> at the <hi>toll</hi> of a <hi>bell,</hi> for as the one
only tells us the <hi>time</hi> when we ought to go
to Worship <hi>God;</hi> so the mentioning the
name of <hi>Iesus</hi> doth only put us in mind
of him we owe all manner of reverence to,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:45050:75"/>
without dishonouring him as the <hi>object</hi> of
our Worship, by any <hi>image</hi> of him, which
can only represent that which is neither the
<hi>object</hi> nor <hi>reason</hi> of our <hi>Worship.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. <hi>To kneeling at the Eucharist,</hi> that of
all things should not be objected to us,
who have declared in our <hi>Rubrick</hi> after
<hi>Communion,</hi> 
               <q>That thereby no adoration
is intended or ought to be done either
unto the Sacramental Bread and Wine,

            <p>
               <hi>To bowing towards the Altar,</hi> or at entring

of the same nature with the <hi>putting off our

way which the ancient <hi>Christians</hi> did use to

            <head>CHAP. II. Of their Idolatry in Adoration of the
Host and Invocation of Saints.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>The Argument proposed concerning the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Host; the insufficiency of the
Answer to it manifested: supposing equal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
for Transubstantiation as for Christs
Divinity, yet not the same reason for Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
the Host as the person of Christ;
the great disparity between these two at
large discovered; the Controversie truly
stated concerning Adoration of the Host:
and it is proved, that no man on the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of the Roman Church can be secure
he doth not commit Idolatry in it. The
confession of our Adversaries, that the same
Principles will justifie the Worship of any
Creature. No such motives to believe
Transubstantiation as the Divinity of
Christ. Bishop <hi>Taylor's</hi> Testimony an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
by himself. To Worship Christ in
the Sun as lawful as to Worship him in the
Host. The grossest Idolatry excusable on the
same grounds. The argument proposed
and vindicated concerning the Invocation
of Saints practised in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
The Fathers Arguments against the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
hold against Invocation of Saints;
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:45050:76"/>
the state of the Controversie about Idolatry
as managed by them. They make it wholly
unlawful to give divine Worship to any
Creature how excellent soever. The Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
not only of Heathen Gods, but of
Angels condemned. The common evasions
answered. Prayer more proper to God than
Sacrifice. No such disparity as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
between the manner of Invocating
Saints and the Heathens Invocating their
Deities. In the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they do
more than pray to Saints to pray for them,
proved from the present most Authentick
Breviaries. Supposing that were all, it
would not excuse them. St. <hi>Austin</hi> no
friend to Invocation of Saints. Practices
condemned by the Church pleaded for it.
Of Negative points being Articles of faith.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>§. 1. <hi>I Proceeded</hi> to the Adoration of the
Host;<note place="margin">Of the Adoration of the Host.</note> 
               <hi>and here the Argument I
proposed, was, to take off the common an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</hi>
That this could not be Idolatry because
they believed the Bread to be God, <hi>upon the</hi>
same ground, <hi>I said,</hi> they who believe the Sun
to be God and Worship him on that account
would be excused from Idolatry too, nay the
grosser their Idolatry was, the more excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable
it would be, as that of those who sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
their Images to be Gods, and upon this
ground their Worship was more Lawful than
of those who supposed them not to be so. <hi>To
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:45050:77"/>
this he answers two wayes;</hi> 1. That they
do not barely suppose that the substance of
bread is changed into Christs body, and that
he is really present under the form of Bread,
but that they know and believe this upon the
same grounds and motives upon which they
believe that Christ is God, and consequently to
be adored; and further addes, that the same
argument will hold against the adoration of
Christ as God, as against the adoration of him in
the Eucharist, since they have a like Divine
Revelation for his real presence under the
Sacramental signes, as for his being true God
and man. 2. Supposing they were mistaken,
yet it would not follow they were Idolaters,
which he proves from Dr. <hi>Taylors</hi> words.
<hi>But notwithstanding these appearances of
answering, that my argument still stands
good, will be evident by proving these
things. 1. That supposing there were the
same revelation of</hi> Christs Divinity, <hi>and of
his</hi> presence <hi>in the</hi> Eucharist <hi>by</hi> Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,
<hi>yet there could not be the same
reason for the</hi> Adoration <hi>of the</hi> Host, <hi>as
for</hi> worshipping Christ <hi>himself. 2. That
there are not the same motives and grounds
to believe that Doctrine of</hi> Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim,
<hi>that there are to believe that</hi> Christ <hi>is</hi>
God. 3. <hi>That supposing they are mistaken
in the doctrine of</hi> Transubstantiation, <hi>this
doth not excuse them from</hi> Idolatry.
4. <hi>That the same reason which would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:45050:77"/>
them, would excuse the most gross</hi>
Idolaters <hi>in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. That supposing there were the
same divine revelation of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi>
and of <hi>Christs Divinity,</hi> yet there could not
be the same <hi>reason</hi> for <hi>adoration</hi> of the <hi>Host</hi>
as of <hi>Christ</hi> himself. 1. Because there is a
plain <hi>command</hi> in <hi>Scripture</hi> for one, and
there is <hi>nothing</hi> like it for the other. <hi>All
the Angels are commanded to Worship the Son
of God,</hi> Heb. 1. 6. and much more <hi>all men</hi>
who have greater obligation to do it.
<hi>All men are to honour the Son as they honour
the Father,</hi> Joh. 5. 23. and <hi>to his name every
knee is to bow,</hi> Phil. 2. 10. But where is
there the least intimation given that we are
to Worship <hi>Christ</hi> in the <hi>Elements,</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
him <hi>present</hi> there? If it be said, <hi>the
general command doth extend to him where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he is present,</hi> It is easily answered that
this argument doth prove no more his <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>
in the <hi>Elements,</hi> than in a <hi>turfe,</hi> or
any other <hi>piece</hi> of <hi>bread;</hi> for <hi>Christ</hi> being
<hi>God</hi> is every where present; and if his
<hi>presence</hi> only may be ground of giving
<hi>adoration</hi> to that wherein he is <hi>present,</hi>
we may as lawfully Worship the <hi>Sun,</hi>
or the <hi>Earth</hi> or any other thing, as they
do the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> For he is <hi>present</hi> in
all of them. But our <hi>Worship</hi> is not to be
guided by our own Fancies, but the will of
<hi>God;</hi> and we have a <hi>command</hi> for Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:45050:78"/>
of the <hi>person</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and till we
see one as to his presence in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi>
we ought not to think the one <hi>parallel</hi> with
the other. And by this the weakness of his
retorting the argument <hi>in the Arrians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half</hi>
(so he calls <hi>those who believe Christ to
be a pure man) against those who Worship
the Son of God will appear:</hi> for our Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
doth not meerly depend upon our <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi>
but upon the <hi>divine command;</hi> and
therefore those who have denyed the
one, have yet contended for the other.
2. The one gives us a sufficient <hi>reason</hi> for
our <hi>Worship,</hi> but the other doth not: There
can be no greater reason for giving his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<hi>adoration</hi> than that he is the <hi>eternal Son
of God;</hi> but what equivalent reason to
this is there, supposing the <hi>bread</hi> to be
really converted into the <hi>body</hi> of <hi>Christ?</hi>
All that I can believe then present is <hi>the
body of Christ;</hi> and what then? is that the
<hi>object</hi> of our <hi>adoration?</hi> do we terminate
our Worship upon his humane nature? and
was it ever more properly so than in <hi>dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi>
is it not the death of <hi>Christ</hi> that is
set forth in the <hi>Eucharist?</hi> And is his body
present any other way than as it is agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the end of the <hi>institution?</hi> But it
may be they will say, <hi>the body of Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hypostatically united with the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
one cannot be present without the other.</hi>
That indeed is a good argument to prove
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:45050:78"/>
the body of <hi>Christ</hi> cannot be there by
<hi>transubstantiation:</hi> for if the bread be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
into that <hi>body</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> which is
<hi>hypostatically</hi> united with the <hi>divine nature,</hi>
then the conversion is not meerly into the
<hi>body</hi> but into the <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and then
<hi>Christ</hi> hath as many bodies <hi>hypostatically</hi>
united to him, as there are <hi>Elements</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated,
and so all the accidents of the
<hi>bread</hi> belong to that <hi>body</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> which
is <hi>hypostatically</hi> united with the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Nay to make the Elements the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of <hi>divine worship</hi> as they do; they must
suppose an <hi>hypostatical union</hi> between <hi>them</hi>
and the <hi>divine nature</hi> of Christ; for if the
only reason of joyning the <hi>humane nature</hi>
with the <hi>divine</hi> in the <hi>person of Christ</hi> as the
<hi>object</hi> of our <hi>Worship,</hi> be the <hi>hypostatical
union</hi> of those Natures; then we can
upon no other account make those Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
the <hi>object of Worship,</hi> but by sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
such an <hi>union</hi> between <hi>Christ</hi> and
<hi>them.</hi> But I suppose they will not venture
to say, that <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>hypostatically</hi> united
with the <hi>shape, figure</hi> and <hi>colour</hi> of the
<hi>bread:</hi> for they will have nothing else to
remain after Consecration (in spight of all
the reason and sense of the world) but
meerly those <hi>accidents;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Concil Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Sess. 13. c. 5.</note> and the <hi>Council</hi> of
<hi>Trent</hi> determines <hi>That the same Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
which we give to God himself, is in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
terms to be given to the most holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:45050:79"/>
and pronounces an Anathema against
all who deny it.</hi> And what is the holy <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi>
but the <hi>body of Christ,</hi> according
to them under the <hi>accidents</hi> of the <hi>bread;</hi>
and although the <hi>body</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
to be there is the <hi>reason</hi> of their
<hi>Worship,</hi> yet the Worship is given to the
<hi>Elements</hi> upon that account.</p>
            <p>§. 3. But this being a matter of so
great importance,<note place="margin">The State of the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.</note> to make it as clear as the
nature of the thing will allow, I shall yet
further prove, that, upon the <hi>principles</hi> of
the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> no man can be assured
that he doth not commit <hi>Idolatry</hi> every
time he gives <hi>adoration</hi> to the <hi>Host:</hi> and I
hope this will abundantly add to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
the <hi>disparity</hi> between the Worship
given to the <hi>person</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and that
which is given to the <hi>Eucharist</hi> upon <hi>suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi>
of <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi> But before I
come to this, I shall endeavour to give a
true account of the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie</hi>
between us: which I shall do in these
particulars.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Question</hi> between us is not,
whether the <hi>person</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> is to be Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
<hi>with divine worship;</hi> for that we
freely acknowledge. And although the
humane nature of <hi>Christ, of it self,</hi> can
yield us no sufficient reason for <hi>adoration,</hi>
yet being considered as united to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
nature, that cannot hinder the same
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:45050:79"/>
divine Worship being given to his person,
which belongs to his divine nature;
any more than the <hi>Robes</hi> of a <hi>Prince,</hi> can
take off from the honour due unto him.</p>
            <p>2. It is not, whether the <hi>person</hi> of <hi>Christ,
visibly appearing</hi> to us in any place, ought to
have <hi>divine honour</hi> given to him? For sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
sufficient evidence of such an <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,</hi>
we make no more question of this,
than we do of the former. Neither do we
say, that we need a particular <hi>command</hi> in
such a case to make it lawful; any more
than the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> did at every appearance
of <hi>God</hi> among them; or those who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed
with our <hi>Lord</hi> on earth, every time
they fell down and Worshipped him.
Where our sense and reason is satisfied as
well as St. <hi>Thomas</hi> his was in a <hi>visible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance</hi>
of <hi>Christ,</hi> we can give <hi>divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>
as he did when he said, <hi>My Lord and my
God;</hi> for in this Worship given to the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
of <hi>Christ,</hi> I am sure I give it to nothing,
but what is either <hi>God</hi> or <hi>hypostatically united</hi>
to the divine nature: <hi>But is there not the
same reason of believing Christ to be present
as seeing him?</hi> I answer, in matters of
pure revelation there is, where the matter
proposed to our faith can be no object of
sense; as <hi>Christs</hi> infinite presence in all places
as <hi>God,</hi> I firmly believe upon the credit of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
revelation, and I give divine Worship to
him as <hi>God</hi> suitable to that <hi>infinite presence;</hi>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:45050:80"/>
but our question is, concerning the <hi>visible
presence</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> where honour is given on
the account of the divine nature, but he can
be <hi>known to be present</hi> only by his <hi>humanity,</hi>
in this case I say, the evidence of <hi>sense</hi> is
necessary in order to the true Worshipping
the <hi>person</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> If any should be so
impertinent to urge that saying to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,<note place="margin">Joh. 20. 29.</note>
               <hi>blessed are they that have not seen and
yet have believed,</hi> I shall only say, that doth
not at all relate to this matter, but to the
truth of Christs resurrection.</p>
            <p>3. It is not, concerning the <hi>spiritual
Worship</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> in the Celebration of the
<hi>Eucharist:</hi> For we declare that in all solemn
acts of <hi>Religious Worship,</hi> and particularly
in the <hi>Eucharist</hi> we give divine honour to
the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as well as to the <hi>Father.</hi>
We affirm that we ought not only perform
the offices of <hi>Religion</hi> out of obedience to
his divine commands, but with a due Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of his <hi>Majesty</hi> and power, with
thankfulness for his infinite goodness, and
with trust in his promises, and subjection
of our souls to his supream <hi>Authority.</hi>
About these things which are the main parts
of divine and spiritual Worship we have
no quarrel, nor do we find fault with any
for giving too much to <hi>Christ</hi> in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
but rather for placing too much in
the bare external acts of <hi>adoration,</hi> which
may be performed with all external pomp
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:45050:80"/>
and shew, where there is no inward reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
nor sincere devotion. And yet,</p>
            <p>4. It is not, concerning <hi>external Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
to be shewn in the <hi>time</hi> of receiving
the <hi>Eucharist:</hi> For that our <hi>Church</hi> not only
allowes but enjoynes, and that <hi>not barely
for the avoiding such profanation and disorder
in the holy Communion as might otherwise
ensue,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rubrick after Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</note> 
               <hi>but for a signification of our humble
and grateful acknowledgement of the benefit of
Christ therein given to all worthy receivers.</hi>
But it is withall declared, <hi>that thereby no
Adoration is intended or ought to be done ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unto the Sacramental Bread and Wine
there bodily received, or unto any corporal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of Christs natural flesh and blood;</hi> as I
have already recited it. But the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
concerning the adoration of the <hi>Host</hi>
lyes in these two things. 1. Whether pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<hi>divine Worship</hi> in the <hi>time</hi> of receiving
the <hi>Eucharist</hi> may be given to the <hi>Elements</hi>
on the account of a <hi>corporal presence</hi> of
<hi>Christ</hi> under them? 2. Whether out of
the time of receiving, the same <hi>adoration</hi>
ought to be given to it, when it is <hi>elevated</hi>
or <hi>carried</hi> in <hi>procession,</hi> which we would give
to the very <hi>person</hi> of <hi>Christ?</hi> And that this
is the true state of the Controversie, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to the doctrine and practice of the
<hi>Roman Church</hi> in this point. For it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
determined by the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Concil. T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> c. 5.</note>
               <hi>That there is no manner of doubt left, but
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:45050:81"/>
that all Christians ought to give the same
Worship to this holy Sacrament which they give
to God himself. For it is not therefore less to
be Worshipped because it was instituted by
Christ our Lord that it might be taken.</hi> By
which words the true state of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
is made evident, which is not about
the <hi>reverence</hi> due only to <hi>Christ,</hi> supposed to
be <hi>corporally present</hi> there, but the <hi>adoration</hi>
due to the <hi>Sacrament</hi> upon that account. And
by the <hi>Sacrament</hi> the <hi>Council</hi> must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the <hi>elements</hi> or <hi>accidents</hi> (or whatever
name they call them by) as the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
<hi>term</hi> of that <hi>divine Worship,</hi> or else the
latter words signifie nothing at all. For
what was that, <hi>which was instituted by our
Lord as a Sacrament?</hi> was it not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
and visible signes or elements? why
do they urge, <hi>that the Sacrament ought not
the less to be adored because it was to be taken,</hi>
but to take off the common objection that
we ought not to give divine Worship to
that which we eat? And what can this
have respect to but the <hi>Elements?</hi> But this
is not denyed, that I know of, by any who
understand either the doctrine or practice
of that <hi>Church;</hi> although to answer our
Arguments they would seem to direct their
<hi>Worship</hi> only to <hi>Christ</hi> as present under the
<hi>elements,</hi> yet yielding that on the account of
this <hi>corporal presence,</hi> that which <hi>appears,</hi>
ought to have the same <hi>Worship</hi> given to it,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:45050:81"/>
with that which is supposed or believed.
And so they make the <hi>accidents</hi> of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi>
to have the very same honour
which the <hi>humane nature</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> hath,
which they say hath no <hi>divine honour</hi> for <hi>it
self,</hi> but on the account of the <hi>conjunction</hi> of
the <hi>divinity</hi> with it.</p>
            <p>§. 4. The Controversie being thus
stated I come to shew that upon the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">No secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Roman Church aga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nst Idolatry in Adoration of the Host.</note> no man can
be assured that he doth not commit <hi>Idolatry</hi>
every time he gives <hi>Adoration</hi> to the <hi>Host.</hi>
For it is a principle indisputable among
them, that to give proper divine honour,
called by them <hi>Adoration,</hi> to a creature is
<hi>Idolatry;</hi> but no man upon the principles
of their <hi>Church</hi> can be assured every time
he Worships the <hi>Host,</hi> that he doth not
give proper divine honour to a creature.
For there are two things absolutely necessary
to secure a mans mind in the performance
of an act of divine Worship. 1. That
either the <hi>object</hi> be such in it self, which
deserves and requires such Worship from
us as in the <hi>divine nature of Christ:</hi>
Or, 2. That if of <hi>it self,</hi> it doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it, there be a <hi>reason</hi> sufficient to
give it; as is the <hi>humane nature of
Christ</hi> upon its <hi>union</hi> with the <hi>Divine:</hi>
but in this matter of the <hi>adoration</hi> of the
<hi>Host</hi> no man can be secure of either of
these upon their own Principles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:45050:82"/>
1. He cannot be secure that the <hi>object</hi> is
such as doth deserve <hi>divine worship.</hi> If a
man should chance to believe his senses, or
hearken to his reason, or at least think the
matter disputable, whether that which he
sees to be <hi>bread,</hi> be not really <hi>bread,</hi> what
case is this man in? He becomes an <hi>Idolater</hi>
by not being a <hi>fool</hi> or a <hi>mad man.</hi> But
because we are not now to proceed upon
the principles of <hi>sense</hi> or <hi>reason,</hi> but those
of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> I will suppose the
case of one that goes firmly upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
principles of it, and try whether
such a one can be satisfied in his mind, that
when he gives <hi>divine worship</hi> to the <hi>Host,</hi>
he doth not give it to a <hi>creature.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we are now supposing unreasonable
things, I will suppose my self to be that
person. The <hi>Mass-bell</hi> now rings, and I
must give the same <hi>divine honour</hi> to the
<hi>Host,</hi> which I do to <hi>Christ</hi> himself: but
hold, if it should be but a <hi>meer creature,</hi>
all the world cannot excuse me from <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi>
and my own <hi>Church</hi> condemns me,
all agreeing that this is gross <hi>Idolatry;</hi> how
come I then to be assured, that what but a
little before was a meer creature, is upon
the pronouncing a few words turned into
my Creator. A strange and sudden change!
And I can hardly say, that <hi>God</hi> becoming
<hi>man</hi> was so great a wonder, as a little piece
of <hi>bread</hi> becoming <hi>God.</hi> When <hi>God</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:45050:82"/>
man, he shewed himself to be <hi>God,</hi> by
Wonders and Miracles which he wrought
for the conviction of the world: I will see,
if I can find any such evidence of so won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
a <hi>transformation</hi> from a Wafer to a
<hi>Deity.</hi> I see it to be the very <hi>same</hi> it was,
I handle it as I did, if I taste it, it hath the
very same agreeableness to the <hi>Palat</hi> it had:
Where then lyes this mighty <hi>change?</hi> But
O <hi>carnal reason,</hi> what have I to do with
thee in these <hi>mysteries</hi> of <hi>faith!</hi> I remember
what <hi>Church</hi> I am of, and how much I
am bid to beware of <hi>thee:</hi> but how then
shall I be satisfied? Must I relye on the bare
words of <hi>Christ, This is my body?</hi> But I
have been told, the <hi>Scripture</hi> is very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
and dangerous for me to be too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
of the <hi>sense</hi> of it. I have heard
some wise men of our <hi>church</hi> have said,
that these words may bear a <hi>figurative
sense,</hi> like <hi>that rock was Christ,</hi> and that if
there were no other evidence for <hi>transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,</hi>
but what the <hi>Scripture</hi> gives,
there were no reason to make it an Article
of faith. I have heard the great names of
<hi>Scotus, Aliaco, Biel, Fisher, Cajctan, Canus</hi>
and others quoted to this purpose, and
their testimonies produced. What a case
am I in then, if those <hi>words</hi> do not prove
it? Now I think better of it, I must trust
the <hi>Church</hi> for the sense of <hi>Scripture;</hi> and
if I be not strangely mistaken, I am sworn
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:45050:83"/>
to interpret <hi>Scripture</hi> according to the <hi>una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous
consent of the Fathers:</hi> but alas,
what relief is this to my anxious mind?
This is a thing I am to do or not to do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
every day, and to be resolved of it,
I am put to a task which will hold me all
my life time: and may be as unsatisfied at
last as I am now. For I see the world is
full of Disputes concerning the sense of
their words as well as the <hi>Scriptures:</hi> One
saith, that a Father by a <hi>figure</hi> means a
<hi>substance,</hi> and that another by a <hi>substance</hi>
means a <hi>figure;</hi> one man sayes his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
authorities are <hi>counterfeit,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sayes the same of his: one quotes the
saying of an <hi>Heretick</hi> for the <hi>Orthodox;</hi> and
another makes it appear, that if he spake
his own mind, he must contradict himself
and others of the <hi>Fathers.</hi> One produces
a <hi>Pope</hi> confirming the Doctrine of <hi>transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,</hi>
and another as plain a testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of a <hi>Pope</hi> of greater antiquity and more
learning overthrowing it. One appeals to
the first Ages of the <hi>Church,</hi> another to the
<hi>latest:</hi> one saith, the <hi>Fathers</hi> spake <hi>Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi>
and another, <hi>Dogmatically.</hi> One, that
they loved to talk <hi>mystically,</hi> and another,
that they spake <hi>differently</hi> about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
In this great confusion what ground
of certainty have I to stand upon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to secure my mind from commission of
a great sin? I am sure if I live in wilful sin
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:45050:83"/>
all my dayes, I shall be damned; but <hi>God</hi>
hath never told me, if I do not study the
<hi>Fathers</hi> all my life, I shall be damned. It is
<hi>satisfaction</hi> I desire, and that I am not like
to have this way, when I see men of greater
Wit, and Subtlety, and Judgement, than
ever I am like to come to, are still disputing
about the sense of the Fathers in this point:
Witness the late heats in <hi>France</hi> about it.
While I am in this <hi>Labyrinth</hi> a kind <hi>Priest</hi>
offers to give me ease, and tells me, these
are doubts and scruples I ought not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
my self about, the authority of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<hi>Church</hi> is sufficient for me: I thank
him for his kindness, only desiring to know,
what he means by the authority of the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Church:</hi> For I find we <hi>Catholicks</hi> are
not agreed about that neither. May I be
sure if the <hi>Pope</hi> who is <hi>Head of the Church</hi>
say it? No, not unless he <hi>defines</hi> it: but
may I be sure then? No, not unless a <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Council</hi> concur: but may I be sure, if
a <hi>General Council</hi> determines it? Yes, if it
be confirmed <hi>wholly</hi> by the <hi>Pope,</hi> and doth
proceed <hi>in the way of a Council:</hi> but how
is it possible for me to judge of that, when
the intrigues of actions are so secret? I see
then, if this be the only way of satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I must forbear giving adoration, or be
guilty of <hi>Idolatry</hi> in doing it. But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
I am satisfied in the point of <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,</hi>
it is not enough for me to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:45050:84"/>
know in general, that there is such a
<hi>change;</hi> but I must believe particularly that
very <hi>bread</hi> to be <hi>changed</hi> so, which I am
now to worship, and by what means can I
be sure of that? For my <hi>Church</hi> tells me,
that it is necessary that he be a <hi>Priest</hi> that
consecrates, and that he had an <hi>intention</hi> of
consecrating that very <hi>bread</hi> which I am to
adore. But what if it should come to pass
after many consecrations, that such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
prove no <hi>Priest,</hi> because not rightly
<hi>baptized;</hi> (which is no unheard of thing)
what became of all their actions who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
every <hi>Host</hi> he pretended to conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate?
They must be guilty of <hi>Idolatry</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Mass</hi> he celebrated. But how is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for me to be sure of his <hi>Priesthood,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
I could be sure of the <hi>intention</hi> of the
<hi>Bishop</hi> that <hi>ordained</hi> him, and the <hi>Priest</hi> that
<hi>baptized</hi> him? which it is impossible for
me to be. Yet suppose I were sure he was
a <hi>Priest,</hi> what assurance have I, that he had
an intention to consecrate that very <hi>Wafer</hi>
which I am to adore? If there were thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,
and he had an intention to consecrate
only twelve, if I worship the thirteenth, I
give <hi>divine honour</hi> to a <hi>meer creature;</hi> for
without the <hi>intention</hi> of the <hi>Priest</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration,
it can be nothing else; and then
I am guilty of downright <hi>Idolatry.</hi> So that
upon the principles of the <hi>Roman Church</hi>
no man can be satisfied, that he doth not
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:45050:84"/>
worship a meer creature with divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
when he gives <hi>adoration</hi> to the
<hi>Host.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. No man can be satisfied that he hath
<hi>sufficient reason</hi> for giving this <hi>worship</hi> to the
<hi>Host.</hi> For which we must consider, what
<hi>suppositions</hi> the <hi>adoration</hi> of the <hi>Host</hi> depends
upon, if any of which prove uncertain, I
am in as bad a case as I was before. I first
suppose, that the bread being really and
substantially changed into that very <hi>body of
Christ</hi> which was crucified at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> I
ought to give the same <hi>honour</hi> to that <hi>body
of Christ</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> which I am to
give to the <hi>person</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> as <hi>God and man,</hi>
and that the <hi>body</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> being <hi>present</hi> in
the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> I may on the account of that
<hi>presence</hi> give the same <hi>honour</hi> to the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
in which he is present. But if it prove
uncertain, whether the <hi>humane nature</hi> of
<hi>Christ</hi> as conjoyned to the <hi>divine nature</hi> be
capable of receiving proper divine worship,
then it must be much more so, whether the
body of <hi>Christ</hi> as present in the <hi>Sacrament</hi>
be so? But granting that, it may be yet
uncertain, whether I ought to give the
same <hi>honour</hi> to the <hi>visible</hi> part of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi>
which I do to the <hi>humanity</hi> of
<hi>Christ;</hi> for though <hi>Christ</hi> may be <hi>present</hi>
there, his <hi>presence</hi> doth not make the things
wherein he is present, capable of the same
divine honour with himself. Now that
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:45050:85"/>
these things are uncertain upon their own
principles, I now make appear. I find it
generally agreed by the <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church,</hi> that the <hi>humane nature</hi> of
<hi>Christ,</hi> considered alone, ought not to have
<hi>divine honour</hi> given to it; and I find it hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
disputed among them, whether <hi>Christs
humane nature</hi> though <hi>united</hi> to the <hi>divine,</hi>
ought, abstractly considered, to have any
true <hi>divine honour</hi> given it; and those who
deny it, make use of this substantial argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>proper divine honour is due only to
God, but the humane nature of Christ is
not God, and therefore that honour ought not
to be given it:</hi> and I am further told by
them, that the <hi>Church</hi> hath never determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
this controversie. Let me now apply
this to our present case: It is <hi>certain</hi> if
the <hi>body</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> be <hi>present</hi> in the <hi>Eucharist</hi>
as <hi>distinct</hi> from the <hi>divine nature</hi> I am not
not to adore it: It is very <hi>uncertain,</hi> if it
be present, whether I am to give <hi>divine
worship</hi> to the <hi>body of Christ;</hi> but it is most
certain, that if I worship <hi>Christ</hi> in the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi>
it is upon the account of his <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
presence.</hi> For although when I wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the <hi>person</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> as out of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi>
my worship is terminated upon
him as <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man;</hi> and the <hi>reason</hi> of my
<hi>worship</hi> is wholly drawn from his <hi>divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
yet when I worship <hi>Christ</hi> as in the
<hi>Sacrament,</hi> I must worship him there upon
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:45050:85"/>
the account of his <hi>bodily presence,</hi> for I have
no other reason to Worship him in the
<hi>Sacrament,</hi> but because his <hi>body</hi> is present in
it. And this is not barely determining the
<hi>place</hi> of <hi>Worship,</hi> but assigning the <hi>cause</hi> of
it; for the primary reason of all <hi>adoration</hi>
in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is, because <hi>Christ</hi> hath
said <hi>this is my body,</hi> which words, if they
should be allowed to imply <hi>Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
cannot be understood of any other
<hi>change</hi> than of the <hi>bread</hi> into the <hi>body</hi> of
<hi>Christ.</hi> And if such a sense were to be
put upon it, why may not I imagine much
more agreeably to the nature of the
institution, that the meer <hi>humane nature</hi> of
<hi>Christ</hi> is there, than that his <hi>Divinity</hi> should
be there in a particular manner present to
no end; and where it makes not the least
manifestation of it self.</p>
            <p>But if I should yield all that can be
begged in this kind, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>body</hi> of
<hi>Christ</hi> being present, his <hi>divinity</hi> is there
<hi>present</hi> too; yet my mind must unavoidably
rest unsatisfied still as to the <hi>adoration</hi> of the
<hi>Host.</hi> For supposing the <hi>divine nature</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in any thing gives no ground upon
that account, to give the same <hi>Worship</hi> to
the thing wherein he is present, as I do to
<hi>Christ</hi> himself. This the more considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
men of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> are aware
of, but the different wayes they have taken
to answer it, rather increase mens doubts
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:45050:86"/>
than satisfie them.<note place="margin">Greg. de Val. de Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lol. l. 2. c. 5.</note>

and in the case of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> he
yields such a losing the proper <hi>subsistence</hi> of
the <hi>bread,</hi> and that what ever <hi>remains</hi> makes
no <hi>distinct suppositum</hi> from the <hi>body</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi>
but all belong to him and make <hi>one</hi> with

last derive only, the <hi>ground</hi> of <hi>adoration;</hi>
very ingenuously yields the Consequence
and grants that <hi>God</hi> may very lawfully be
<hi>adored</hi> by us in any <hi>created being,</hi> wherein he
is intimately present: and this he not only
grants, but contends for in a set <hi>disputation,</hi>
wherein he proves very well from the
<hi>principles</hi> of <hi>Worship</hi> allowed in the <hi>Roman
Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Disput. 110. c. 2, 3.</note> that <hi>God</hi> may be adored in <hi>inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
and irrational beings</hi> as well as in
<hi>Images,</hi> and answers all the arguments the
very same way that they defend the other,
and that we way Worship the <hi>Sun</hi> as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and with the same kind of Worship
that they do an <hi>Image,</hi> and that men may
be worshipped with the same worship
with which we Worship <hi>God</hi> himself if our
mind do not rest in the Creature, but be
terminated upon <hi>God,</hi> as in the <hi>adoration</hi> of
the <hi>Host.</hi> See here the admirable effects of
the doctrine of <hi>divine worship</hi> allowed and
required in the <hi>Roman Church!</hi> For, upon
the very same principles that a <hi>Papist</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
<hi>Images, Saints,</hi> and the <hi>Host,</hi> he may
as lawfully worship the <hi>Earth,</hi> the <hi>Stars,</hi> or
<hi>Men;</hi> and be no more guilty of <hi>Idolatry</hi> in
one than in the other of them. So that if
we have no more reason to Worship the
<hi>person</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> than they have to <hi>adore</hi>
the <hi>host,</hi> upon their principles we have no
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:45050:87"/>
more ground to worship <hi>Christ,</hi> than we
have to worship any <hi>creature</hi> in the World.</p>
            <p>§. 5. 2. There are not the same mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
and grounds to believe the doctrine
of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">No such motives to believe Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation as the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of Christ.</note> that there are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>God,</hi> which he affirms,
but without any appearance of reason.
And I would gladly know what excellent
motives and reasons those are which so
advantageously recommend so absurd a
doctrine as Transubstantiation is, as to
make any man think he hath reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it? I am sure it gives the greatest ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to the enemies of <hi>Christs Divinity,</hi> to
see these two put together upon equal terms:
as though no man could have reason to believe
<hi>Christ</hi> to be the <hi>Eternal Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that did
not at the same time swallow the greatest
contradictions to sense and reason imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.
But what doth he mean <hi>by these
motives and grounds to believe?</hi> The autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the <hi>Roman Church?</hi> I utterly deny
that to be any ground of believing at all,
and desire with all my heart to see it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
but this is a proper means to believe
Transubstantiation by, for the ground of
believing is as absurd as the doctrine to be
believed by it. If he means <hi>Catholick Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi>
let him prove if he can, that Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation
was a Doctrine received in
the <hi>universal Church</hi> from our <hi>Saviours</hi>
time; and when he pleases I shall joyne
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:45050:87"/>
issue with him upon that Subject. And
if he thinks fit to put the negative upon me,
I will undertake to instance in an <hi>Age</hi> since
the three first Centuries, wherein if the most
learned Fathers, and <hi>Bishops,</hi> (yea of <hi>Rome</hi>
it self) be to be credited, Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was not believed. But if at last he
means <hi>Scripture,</hi> (which we acknowledge
for our only rule of faith, and shall do in
spight of all pretences to <hi>infallibility</hi> either
in <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Tradition)</hi> I shall appeal even
to <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himself in this case, whether
there are the same motives and grounds
from thence to believe <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> as
there are, the <hi>Divinity</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> In the
proof of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> his only Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
is from those words, <hi>this is my body,
which words</hi> saith he,<note place="margin">Bellar. de Sacr. Euch. l. 3. c. 19.</note> 
               <hi>do necessarily inferre
either a real mutation of the Bread as the
Catholicks hold, or a metaphorical as the
Calvinists, but by no means do admit the
Lutherans sense;</hi> and so spends the rest of
the Chapter against them: and concludes
it thus, <hi>although there be some obscurity or
ambiguity in the words of our Lord, yet that
is taken away by Councils and Fathers,</hi> and
so passes to them. Which are a plain indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
he thought the same which others
of his <hi>Religion</hi> have said, <hi>that the doctrine
of Transubstantiation could not be proved
from Scripture alone.</hi>
               <note place="margin">De Christo l. 1. c. 4.</note> But when he proves
the <hi>Divinity</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> he goes through nine
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:45050:88"/>
several <hi>classes</hi> of arguments, six of which
are wholly out of <hi>Scripture;</hi> the first out
of both <hi>Testaments,</hi> the second only out
of the <hi>Old,</hi> the third out of the <hi>New,</hi> the
fourth from the names of the true <hi>God</hi>
given to Christ, the fifth from the Divine
Attributes, Eternity, Immensity, Power,
Wisdome, Goodness, Majesty; the sixth
from the proper <hi>works</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> Creation,
Conservation, Salvation, Fore-knowing of
secret things, and working Miracles. All
which he largely insists upon with great
strength and clearness, so that if he may be
judge, the motives to believe the <hi>Divinity</hi>
of <hi>Christ,</hi> are far from being the same in
<hi>Scripture,</hi> that there are to believe <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation.</hi>
            </p>

excuse them,<note place="margin">The grossest Idolatry excusable on the same grounds. Aug. prefat. in Psal. 93. To. 8. p. 2. p. 184.</note> it would excuse the grossest
<hi>Idolatry</hi> in the world. St. <hi>Austin</hi> speaks of
some, <hi>who said that Christ was the Sun, and
therefore worshipped the Sun,</hi> I desire to know
whether this were <hi>Idolatry</hi> in them or no?
They had <hi>Scripture</hi> to plead for it as plain
as, <hi>This is my body,</hi> for he is not only called
<hi>the Sun of Righteousness;</hi> but the Vulgar
Latin (which they contend to be the only
authentick version) reads that place,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:45050:89"/>
               <hi>Psal. 19. 6. in sole posuit tabernaculum suum,</hi> he

be proved from the <hi>Apostles</hi> applying the
other words, <hi>their line is gone out through
all the earth;</hi> to the <hi>Apostles</hi> Preaching the
<hi>Gospel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aug. c. Faust Manich. l. 20. c. 1. 68.</note> Rom. 10. 18. And the <hi>Manichees</hi>
did believe that <hi>Christ</hi> had his residence
partly in the Sun and partly in the Moon,
and therefore they directed their prayers
alwayes to the Sun. Let us now consider
two persons equally perswaded, that the
<hi>Sun</hi> is now the Tabernacle of <hi>Christ,</hi> and
that he is really present there, and dispenses
all the comfortable influences of heat and
light to the world, he being so often in
Scripture called the <hi>true light,</hi> 1 Joh. 8. 9.
and another, that he is really present by
<hi>Transubstantiation</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> I
would fain understand why the one should
not be as free from <hi>Idolatry</hi> as the other?
If it be said, <hi>that all those places which
speak of Christ as the Sun, are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
metaphorically,</hi> that is the same thing
we say to them concerning those words of
<hi>Christ, this is my body;</hi> and if notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that, they are excused by believing
otherwise; so must the other person una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably
be so too. It is to no purpose to
alledge <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Councils</hi> for the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
more than for the other; for the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is not concerning the probability of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:45050:90"/>
one mistake more than of the other (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
if they be strictly examined, the
absurdities of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> are much
greater) but we suppose a <hi>mistake</hi> in both,
and the question is whether such a mistake
doth excuse from <hi>Idolatry</hi> or no? and we
are not to enquire into the reasons of the
<hi>mistake,</hi> but the influence it hath upon our
actions. And then we are to understand
why a mistake equally involuntary as to the
real object of divine adoration may not
excuse from <hi>Idolatry,</hi> as well as to the wrong
application of Worship due to a real object
of adoration? <hi>i. e.</hi> whether a man giving
adoration to what he believes to be <hi>God,</hi>
which is not so in it self, be not as excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable,
as believing a true object of adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in general, but giving divine worship
to that which is not it? as whether the
Worshipping false Gods, supposing them to
be true, be not as venial a fault, as Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
that for the true <hi>God</hi> which is not
so? as for instance, suppose the <hi>Aegyptians</hi>
Worshipping the <hi>Sun</hi> for <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi>
the golden <hi>Calf,</hi> believing it was the

               <note place="margin">Garcilasso de la vega le Conmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire Royal. liv. 2. c. 1.</note> who believed by a Tradition
supposed infallible among them, that the
<hi>Sun</hi> was their <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>visible God,</hi> by
which the <hi>Invisible</hi> did govern the World;
and therefore they ought to give all external
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:45050:90"/>
adoration to the Sun, and internal only to
the <hi>Invisible Deity;</hi> upon what account shall
these be charged with Idolatry, if an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary
mistake and firm belief that they
worship the true God doth excuse from
it? Nay the most stupid and senseless of
all <hi>Idolaters</hi> who worshipped the very
<hi>Images</hi> for <hi>Gods</hi> (which the wisest among
them alwayes disclaimed, and pretended
only such a relative worship as he pleads
for) were in truth the most excusable up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this ground; for supposing that it be
true which they believed, they did a very
good thing; and which every person else
ought to do upon the same belief. Which
is the utmost can be said for the <hi>Papists</hi>
adoration of the <hi>Host,</hi> supposing the doctrine
of <hi>transubstantiation</hi> were as true, as it is

            <p>§. 8. 3. <hi>As</hi> to invocation of Saints,<note place="margin">Of Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Saints.</note> 
               <hi>I
found the chief answer given was this,</hi>
That they did not attribute the same kind of
excellency to Saints, which they give to God;
but suppose only a middle sort of excellency
between God and us, which they make the
foundation of the worship which is given to
them. <hi>And as to this my argument was
thus framed, If the supposition of a middle
excellency between God and us, be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
ground for formal invocation, then
the Heathens worship of their inferiour</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities
<hi>could be no</hi> Idolatry, <hi>for they still pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:45050:91"/>
they did not give to them the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
proper to the supream</hi> God; <hi>which is
as much as is pretended by the devoutest</hi>
Papists <hi>in justification of the</hi> Invocation of
Saints. <hi>To this he answers two wayes:</hi>
1. By shewing the disparity of the Heathens
worship from theirs <hi>in two things:</hi> 1. In
the object. 2. In the manner <hi>of their</hi> worship.
1. The persons whom they worship, <hi>he saith,</hi>
are such as are endowed with supernatural gifts
of grace in this life, and glory in Heaven,
whose prayers by consequence are acceptable
and available with God, but the Supream
Deity of the Heathens, is known to be <hi>Jupiter,</hi>
and their inferiour Deities <hi>Venus, Mars, Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,
Vulcan,</hi> and the like rabble of Devils
as the Scripture calls them; and therefore there
can be no consequence, that because the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
were Idolaters in the worship of these,
though they pretended not to give them the
worship proper to <hi>Jupiter</hi> the supream God;
therefore the Catholicks must be guilty of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
in desiring the servants of the true
God to pray for them to him. 2. As to the
manner of worship, <hi>he saith,</hi> If any of them did
attain, as the <hi>Platonists,</hi> to the knowledge of
the true God, yet as <hi>St. Paul</hi> sayes, they did
not glorifie him as God, but changed his glory
into an Image made like to corruptible man,
adoring and offering sacrifice due to God
alone to the Statues themselves, or the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Deities they supposed to dwell or assist in
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:45050:91"/>
them; which <hi>St. Austin</hi> upon the 90. <hi>Psalm</hi>
proves to be Devils, or evil Angels, because
they required sacrifice to be offered to them,
and would be worshipped as Gods. But all he
means by formal Invocation, <hi>he saith is,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
or praying the Saints to pray for them.
And if this were Idolatry, we must not desire
the prayers of a just man, even in this life,
because this formal invocation will be to make
him an Inferiour Deity. 2. <hi>He answers,</hi>
that the same calumny was cast upon the
Catholicks in <hi>St. Austins</hi> time, and is answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by him, and his answer will serve as well
now as then, in his twentieth Book against
<hi>Faustus, Chap.</hi> 21. who himself held formal
Invocation a part of the worship due to Saints,
as is evident from the prayer he made to
<hi>St. Cyprian</hi> after his Martyrdom, <hi>l. 7. de
bapt. c. Donat. c.</hi> 1. and <hi>Calvin</hi> confesseth
<hi>(he saith)</hi> it was the custom at that time to
say, Holy <hi>Mary,</hi> or Holy <hi>Peter</hi> pray for us.
<hi>This is his full answer: in which are two
things to be examined. 1. Whether the
disparity between the</hi> Heathen worship <hi>and
theirs be so great as to excuse them from</hi>
Idolatry? 2. <hi>Whether the answer given
by St.</hi> Austin <hi>doth vindicate them: and
whether</hi> Invocation <hi>of</hi> Saints <hi>as it is now
practised in the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> Rome, <hi>were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
or in use then?</hi>
            </p>

§. 9. 1. Concerning the disparity.<note place="margin">The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments against Heathen Idolatry condemn Invocation of Saints.</note> 1. As
to the <hi>object</hi> of <hi>worship.</hi> Far be it from me
to parallel the <hi>Holy Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> with
the impure <hi>Deities</hi> of the <hi>Heathens;</hi> as to
their excellencies: but the true state of the
<hi>Question</hi> is, whether the <hi>Heathens</hi> were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
too blame in making an ill choice of
those they worshipped, as in worshipping
<hi>Iupiter,</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> and <hi>Vulcan,</hi> who are
supposed to have been wicked wretches; or
else in giving divine worship to any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the true <hi>God?</hi> And if their <hi>Idolatry</hi>
lay not only in the former, but the latter,
then this disparity cannot excuse them.
There were two <hi>Questions</hi> in debate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Primitive <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Christian
Church,</hi> and the <hi>Heathen Idolaters;</hi> The first
was more general, and <hi>in thesi,</hi> whether it
were lawful to give divine worship to any
besides the true and Supream God? The
second was more particular, and <hi>in hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesi,</hi>
whether on supposition that were
lawful, those whom the <hi>Heathens</hi> worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
were fit objects for such adoration? In
this latter they triumph over them with a
great deal of eloquence, laying open the
impiety of those whom they commonly
worshipped; but withal knowing that the
wiser among them had another notion of
these <hi>Deities</hi> under the common names than
the <hi>Vulgar</hi> had; they therefore charge them
with <hi>Idolatry</hi> in giving the worship proper
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:45050:92"/>
to <hi>God</hi> to any creature, let it be never so
excellent and serviceable to mankind, and
that it was the property of the <hi>Christian
Religion to give divine worship to none but
God himself and his Son Christ Iesus,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ever making any distinctions of abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
and relative worship which they must

worship the true God and Maker of all things,
in the holiness of our hearts and integrity of
our minds.</hi> To the same purpose speak
<hi>Clemens Alexandrinus, Tertullian, Cyprian,
Origen, Athenagoras, Lactantius, Arnobius,</hi>
who all agree, that religious worship is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to the true <hi>God,</hi> and that no created
thing is capable of it, on that very account
because it is created; it were easie to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
their testimonies, if it were requisite
in so evident a matter as this is. If it be
said, <hi>That all these testimonies are only against
that Idolatry which was then practised by the
Heathens.</hi> I answer, 1. Their reasons
equally extend to the giving divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to any <hi>created being</hi> whatsoever, so
that either they argued weakly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfully,
or else it is as unlawful to give
<hi>divine worship</hi> now to <hi>Saints,</hi> as it was then
to any <hi>creature.</hi> 2. I would willingly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
why it should be more unlawful
to worship <hi>God</hi> for his admirable Wisdom,
and Power and Goodness in the works of
Creation; than in supposed <hi>Saints? i. e.</hi> why
I may not as well honour <hi>God</hi> by giving
worship to the <hi>Sun,</hi> as to <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:45050:93"/>
or St. <hi>Francis,</hi> or any other late <hi>Canonized
Saint?</hi> I am sure the <hi>Sun</hi> is a certain mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument
of Gods Goodness, Wisdom, and
Power, and I cannot be mistaken therein,
but I can never be certain of the <hi>Holiness</hi>
of those persons I am to give divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to. For all that I can know, <hi>Ignatius
Loyola</hi> was a great hypocrite; but I am
sure that the <hi>Sun</hi> is none; but that he
shines and communicates perpetual influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
to the huge advantage of the world.
However I know the best of men have their
corruptions, and to what degree it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for others to understand; but I am
certain the spots in the Sun are no Moral
impurities, nor displeasing to God. And
<hi>Philip Nerius</hi> could not be mistaken in the
shining of the <hi>Sun,</hi> although he might be
in the shining of <hi>Ignatius</hi> his face, which
yet is thought so considerable a thing,<note place="margin">Breviar. Rom. 31. Iul. Antw. 1663.</note> that
it is read in the Lessons appointed for <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
in the <hi>Roman Breviary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. On what account should the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
refuse giving all external signs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
worship to the <hi>Heathen Emperours,</hi>
if they thought it lawful to be given to any
sort of men? Why might not they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the <hi>Statues</hi> of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> as well
as others do those of <hi>Rebels</hi> and <hi>Traytors?</hi>
I mean, why might not the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>King
Henry the second</hi> have the same reverence
shewn to it, that the <hi>Shrine</hi> of <hi>Thomas Becket</hi>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:45050:94"/>
had? unless it be more meritorious to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey
a <hi>Prince,</hi> than to give him reverence.
Might not the Primitive <hi>Christians</hi> have
much easier defended themselves in giving
those outward signs of worship to the <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>
of <hi>Emperours,</hi> than others can do in the
worship they give to <hi>Saints?</hi> For they
might have pleaded, that external signs are
to be interpreted by the intention of the
person who uses them, that they intended
no more by it, but the highest degree of
Civil honour on the account of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
they possessed? or if this would not
serve, might not they have said, that <hi>Kings</hi>
and <hi>Princes</hi> were <hi>Gods Vicegerents,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
him to the world, and that in
giving divine worship to them, they gave it
to <hi>God;</hi> and that their absolute, ultimate,
and terminative worship was upon God;
and only a relative, inferior, and transient
worship was given to them, and all this
might be better justified by St. <hi>Basils</hi> rule,<note place="margin">S. Basil. ad Amphiloch. p. 332.</note>
               <hi>That the honour of the Image passes to the
Prototype;</hi> for he there pleads for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of <hi>Christ, because he is one with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
being his Image, as the Image of a King
is called the King, and hath the same honour
given to it; for the honour of the Image pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
to the thing represented.</hi> And as <hi>Christ</hi>
hath the advantage above all, by being
<hi>Gods natural Image;</hi> so <hi>Princes</hi> above <hi>Saints,</hi>
in that they represent <hi>God</hi> to the world,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:45050:94"/>
which the other do not. But notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all these Pleas, the Primitive <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
were so punctual in observing that
Command of worshipping <hi>God</hi> alone, that
they rather chose to lose their lives and
suffer Martyrdom, than be in the least guilty
of giving any divine worship to a creature.</p>
            <p>4. They absolutely deny any religious
worship to be given to the most excellent
created Beings, and therefore did not only
condemn the Idolatry then in use, but that
which hath obtained in the <hi>Roman Church:</hi>
supposing all the persons worshipped there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
to have been real <hi>Saints.</hi> For that, we
are to consider that all the <hi>Heathens</hi> were
not such great Fools, as some men make
them to excuse themselves:<note place="margin">V. Aug. c. Faust. l 20. c. 9.</note> if the wiser
men were contented to let the people wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the <hi>Poetical Gods,</hi> having their minds
possessed with those <hi>Idea's</hi> of them, which
they had taken up by their education; yet
they understood them only as <hi>Allegories,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Baron. Martycol. Apr. 23 &amp; Iulii 25.</note>
(as some make the Image of St. <hi>Christopher</hi>
and St. <hi>George</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to be
no other) and they had Temples erected
to the greatest Vertues, to <hi>Piety, Faith, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
Iustice, Chastity, Clemency, &amp;c.</hi> and
others to the greatest Benefactors to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
which was the only ground they
pleaded for giving worship to them: but
still they acknowledged one <hi>Supream God,</hi>
not <hi>Iupiter</hi> of <hi>Creet,</hi> but <hi>the Father of Gods
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:45050:95"/>
and men;</hi> only they said, <hi>this Supream God</hi>
being of so high a nature, and there being
other intermediate beings between him and
men whose Office they conceived, it was
to carry the prayers of men to God, and to
bring down help from him to them; they
thought it very fitting to address their so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
supplications to them. Here now was
the very same case in debate, (altering on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the names of things) which is between
us and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> and if ever
they speak home to our case, they must do
upon this point. And so they do, but very
little to their comfort.</p>
            <p>§. 10. <hi>These things I shall largely prove
if farther occasion be given,<note place="margin">All divine worship given to a cre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ture condemned by the Fathers.</note> at present I
shall only insist on two things. 1. That
they did condemn all such kind of worship,
supposing their principle true. 2. That
they did not only condemn it in those Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
which the</hi> Heathens <hi>worshipped, but in
good</hi> Angels <hi>themselves. 1. They did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the worship, supposing their principle
true. For this I shall produce now but
few Authorities, but such as are full as to
the</hi> Heathens <hi>pretences,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Origen. c. c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ls. l. 8. p. 381.</note> 
               <hi>and the</hi> Christians
<hi>answers. The first is of</hi> Origen <hi>in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to</hi> Celsus, <hi>who objects against the</hi>
Christians, <hi>the</hi> unreasonableness of forsaking
the worship of inferiour Deities, because no
man can serve two Masters; which, <hi>saith he,</hi>
is a seditious principle, and arises from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:45050:95"/>
our passions to God; but he that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
them as Subjects to the Supream God,
cannot offend him who is the Lord of them.
<hi>To which</hi> Origen <hi>answers,</hi> That the Scripture
doth indeed stile God, the God of Gods, and
Lord of Lords, but withal saith, that to us,
there is but one God the Father, of whom are
all things, and one Lord Iesus Christ, by whom are
all things, and we by him; which the Apostle
speaks, <hi>saith he,</hi> of himself and all others
whose minds were raised up to him, who is
the God of Gods, and Lord of Lords; and his
mind ascends up to the Supream God, who
worships him inseparably and indivisibly by
his Son, who alone conducts us to the Father.
Therefore seeing there are many Gods and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Lords, we endeavour by all means, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to carry our minds above those things on
Earth, which are worshipped by the Heathen
for Gods, but above those whom the Scripture
calls Gods, <hi>by which it is plain by the drift
of his discourse, he means the</hi> Angels. <hi>And</hi>
Celsus <hi>afterwards yielding,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 384.</note> That it is not
lawful to give honour to any, but to whom
the Supream doth communicate it: Origen
<hi>desires proof from them,</hi> That God hath
communicated this honour to their Gods, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes
and Daemons, and that it did not arise
from the ignorance and folly of mankind,
who thereby fell off from him who ought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
to be worshipped. <hi>But he proves,</hi> from
Miracles and Prophecies and Precepts, than
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:45050:96"/>
this honour was given to Christ, that they who
honour the Father, should honour the Son al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so:
<hi>and that was all which</hi> Celsus <hi>had to
object against the</hi> Christians, That they did
not keep to their own rule of worshipping God
alone; for they thought God was not disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
by the honour they gave to Christ; and
on the same account he thought, they might
give it to inferiour Deities. <hi>If there had
been then any suspicion of Religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
given to</hi> Saints <hi>or</hi> Angels <hi>by the</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
<hi>when had there been a more proper
season to object it? No man of the meanest
capacity would have omitted a matter so
necessary to his business, much less so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive
and malicious an enemy as</hi> Celsus
<hi>was. And the account</hi> Origen <hi>gives of the
worship the Christians attribute to the Son
of God is,</hi> because it is said, I and my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are one; and the Father in me, and I
in him; <hi>which cannot be said of any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Beings. It is true afterwards he saith,</hi>
That if <hi>Celsus</hi> had spoken of the true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of God, such as <hi>Gabriel, Michael</hi> and all
the Angels and Archangels, he acknowledges,
that by explaining the notion of worship or
respect, and the actions of those who give it,
somewhat more might be said on that subject.
<hi>But he utterly denyes,</hi> that our prayers are
to be offered to any but Christ alone, and that
any word which is proper only to Religious
worship, is to be attributed to the Angels
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:45050:96"/>
themselves. <hi>For he saith elsewhere,</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Angels be called Gods in Scripture,<note place="margin">L. 5. p. 233.</note>
yet we are not to worship them with divine
worship: <hi>and lest any should think, that
offering up our Prayers or Invocations to
them were not excluded by this; he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
explains himself;</hi> For, <hi>saith he,</hi>
all our supplications, prayers, intercessions
and thanksgivings are to be offered only to
God over all; by that High Priest who is
greater than all the Angels, the living Word
and God. <hi>And afterwards saith,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,<note place="margin">P. 238.</note> we ought not
to pray to them, who pray for us; for they
would rather themselves send us to that God to
whom they pray, than have us pray to them, or
divide our supplications between God and them.
<hi>This he speaks indeed of the</hi> Sun, <hi>and</hi> Moon,
<hi>and</hi> Stars, <hi>but upon the supposition that
they are</hi> intellectual Beings, <hi>and</hi> do pray to
God for us. <hi>And again he saith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">I. 8 p 395.</note> We ought to
pray only to the God over all, and his only
Son the first born of every creature, who as
our High Priest,<note place="margin">P. 402.</note> offers our prayers to his God
and our God. <hi>And because</hi> Celsus <hi>argues
much for worship to be given to</hi> Daemans,
<hi>because</hi> to them is committed the care of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial
affairs: <hi>to this</hi> Origen <hi>answers,</hi> by
denying those whom he calis Daemons,<note place="margin">P. 416.</note> to have
any administration of the affairs of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
but supposing we knew they were not
Daemons, but Angels, which had the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:45050:97"/>
of these things committed to them,
yet then we dare not give them that honour
which is due to God, for neither would God
have it so, nor they themselves; <hi>but</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, we celebrate
their praise and happiness, to whom God hath
entrusted such great things. <hi>But</hi> Celsus <hi>yet
further urges,</hi> that according to the doctrine
of the Aegyptians every part of a man hath
a particular Daemon or Ethereal God, and
every one of these being invocated, heals the
diseases of the parts proper to themselves.
Why then may they not justly invocate them,
if they love health better than sickness, and
happiness than misery. <hi>If one of the</hi> Church
<hi>of</hi> Rome <hi>had been to answer</hi> Celsus, <hi>he must
have told him, that the thing was rational
which he said, only they were out in their
names; for instead of</hi> Chnumen, Chnaachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Cnat, Sicat, Biu, Eru, &amp;c. <hi>they should
have chosen</hi> Raphael <hi>for travelling and
against Diseases,</hi> Apollonia <hi>against the
Tooth-ach,</hi> Sebastian <hi>and</hi> Roch <hi>against the
Plague, St.</hi> Nicholas <hi>against Tempests,</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael
<hi>and St.</hi> George <hi>against Enemies; and
others in like cases.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Serrar. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. 2 q. 32.</note> 
               <hi>For so</hi> Serrarius <hi>tells
us,</hi> That experience and tradition hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
the particular help of these in such
cases; if they be particularly invocated. <hi>But</hi>
Origen <hi>gives a shorter answer,</hi> That these
things do arise from a distrust of the suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
of that incommunicable worship we give
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:45050:97"/>
to God alone, as though he were not able to
protect every one that serves him from all
snares: and that far more effectual cures
have been wrought by the name of Iesus than
all their Daemons. And how much better do those
who are Christians who slight all these things
and commit themselves to God over all through
his son Iesus Christ, and of him do desire the
help and protection of his Holy Angels? <hi>I
shall conclude his Testimony with that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
saying of his.</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 420.</note> Our care ought to be
to please one God over all, and to make him
propitious to us, by piety and all vertue, but
if we would have others under God to be
pleased with us too, we ought to consider, that
as the shadow follows the body, so God being
pleased, all his friends whether Angels, Souls
or Spirits will be so too, and not only so, but
are ready to help them, and pray to God for
them. <hi>But not the least foundation in his
discourse for our invocation of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Author of the</hi> Commentaries <hi>under
the</hi> name <hi>of St.</hi> Ambrose,<note place="margin">Ambros. in 1. Rom. To. 5. p. 174.</note> 
               <hi>of the same age
with him, as appears by several passages in
him: saith,</hi> That the Idolaters made use of
this miserable excuse for themselves, that by
those inferiour Deities they worshipped they
went to God himself, as we go to the King by
his Courtiers. But, <hi>saith he,</hi> is any man so
mad, or regardless of himself, to give the
honour due to the King to any of his Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
which if a man does he is condemned for
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:45050:98"/>
treason? And yet they think themselves not
guilty who, give the honour due to Gods
name to a creature, and forsaking God adore
his fellow servants, as though any thing great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than that were reserved for God himself.
But therefore we go to a King by his Officers
and Servants, because the King is but a
man, who knows not of himself whom to
imploy in his publick affairs, <hi>(without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
recommended by others:)</hi> But with God
it is otherwise, for nothing is hid from him,
he knows the deserts of every one, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we need no one to recommend us to his
Favour; a devout mind is enough. <hi>Was this
now all the quarrel the</hi> Christians <hi>had with
the</hi> Heathens <hi>that they worshipped</hi> Iupiter
<hi>and</hi> Venus <hi>and</hi> Vulcan? <hi>Do they not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
deny the giving</hi> Gods <hi>Worship to any
Creature? and do they not as plainly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
that men do it when they invocate
their</hi> fellow servants <hi>to be intercessors with
God for them? and that it is no less a
guilt of Idolatry in this case, than it is in
giving the</hi> Honour <hi>due to a</hi> Prince <hi>to any of
his Servants?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>St.</hi> Austin <hi>gives this account of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of the</hi> Heathen Worship,<note place="margin">Aug. de Civit. Dei. l. 8. c. 14. 18.</note> that there
were three sorts of beings to be considered,
purely divine, and mortal, and a middle sort
between them which participated of both,
and that the entercourse between Gods and
men was by the means of those intermediate
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:45050:98"/>
Beings, who carried the prayers of men up to
God, and brought down the blessings they
prayed for to men. <hi>Against these indeed
St.</hi> Austin <hi>disputes first, by shewing that
those</hi> spirits <hi>which they worshipped were</hi>
evil spirits, <hi>and that there was no reason to
imagine that</hi> God <hi>had a greater entercourse
with them, than with penitent sinners, but
withall he addes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">C. 21.</note> that this kind of worship
doth proceed upon the supposition that the
Gods cannot know the necessities and prayers
of men, but by the intervention of those Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits:
but if our minds can be known with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their help, there is no need of their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation.<note place="margin">L. 9. c. 15.</note>
               <hi>And afterwards saith,</hi> that those
who are Christians do believe that we need not
many, but one Mediatour, and that such a one
by whose participation we are made happy,
<hi>i. e.</hi> the word of God not made but by whom
all things were made: and he hath shewed
that to the attaining blessedness we ought not
to seek many Mediators, by whom we are
to make our degrees of approach to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
God himself by partaking our Nature,
hath shewn us the shortest way of our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
his divinity. Neither doth he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
us from mortality and misery carry us
so to immortal and blessed Angels, that by
participating with them, we should become
blessed and immortal; but to that Trinity by
whose participation the Angels themselves
are blessed. <hi>And concludes that Book with
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:45050:99"/>
this saying,</hi>
               <note place="margin">L. 9. c. 23.</note> that immortal and blessed Spirits
however they are called, which are made and
created; are no Mediatours to bring misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
mortals, to blessedness and immortality.
<hi>And it would be ridiculous here to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish</hi>
mediators <hi>of</hi> redemption <hi>and</hi> intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<hi>for all that they attributed to their
goods</hi> spirits <hi>was only</hi> Intercession; <hi>and</hi>
Christ <hi>being made a</hi> Mediatour, <hi>effectual for
the end he designed, there could be no
necessity of any</hi> Intercessours <hi>besides him.
And St.</hi> Austin <hi>there addes, that the design
of his following book, is to prove</hi> that
those good Spirits which are immortal and
blessed, which they thought ought to be Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
with Sacred Rites and Sacrifices,
whatsoever they are and howsoever called,
would not have any one worshipped by such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
worship, <hi>(i.e. by</hi> sacred rites <hi>as well
as</hi> Sacrifices) but only one God by whom
they were created, and by whose participation
they are made happy.</p>
            <p>§. 11. By which the second thing I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed

               <hi>viz.</hi> that they

practised by <hi>Iewes, Philosophers,</hi> or <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi>
is all one to us, since the practice is
condemned wherever it is found. <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret</hi>
saith,<note place="margin">Theod. in Coloss 2. 18.</note> 
               <hi>they were the Iewes who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
men to worship Angels, because the
Law was delivered by Angels; which pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi>
he saith, <hi>continued a long time in</hi> Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia
<hi>and</hi> Pisidia, <hi>and therefore the Synod of</hi>
Laodicea <hi>doth forbid praying to Angels; and
to this day the Oratories of St.</hi> Michael <hi>are
among them, they therefore thought it a piece
of humility, since God could not be seen, nor
touched, nor comprehended by us, to obtain the
favour of God, by the intercession of Angels.</hi>
No wonder <hi>Baronius</hi> is so much displeased
with <hi>Theodoret</hi> for this interpretation;<note place="margin">Baron. An. 60. s. 20, 21.</note> for
he very fairly tells us <hi>what he condemns</hi>
(and St. <hi>Paul</hi> too) <hi>was the practice of their
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:45050:100"/>
Church; and those Oratories were set up by
Catholicks and not by hereticks.</hi> But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as to the lawfulness of this Worship,
<hi>Baronius</hi> or St. <hi>Paul,</hi> whether as to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
practice of the <hi>Church, Baronius</hi> or
<hi>Theodoret</hi> deserves more to be believed, I
leave any one to judge. And yet <hi>Theodoret</hi>
is not alone in this,<note place="margin">Iren. l. 2. c. 57.</note> for <hi>Irenaeus</hi> denies <hi>any

Worshipped those Spirits as Gods, and offered

the Doctrine or practice of the Roman Church,
who deny them to be Gods, and assert that the
Worship by Sacrifice is proper only to God:</hi>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:45050:101"/>
but such devices as these are can never sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
an impartial mind. For (1.) They
do expresly deny that <hi>invocation</hi> or <hi>prayer</hi>
is to be made to them; for so <hi>Origen</hi> and
<hi>Theodoret</hi> speak expresly, <hi>that men are not
to pray to Angels;</hi> and any one that reads
St. <hi>Austin</hi> will find that he makes solemn
invocation to be as proper to <hi>God</hi> as Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
is. (2.) On what account should it
be unlawful to <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to <hi>Saints</hi> or <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi>
if it be lawful to <hi>invocate</hi> them? may
not one be <hi>relative</hi> and <hi>transient</hi> as well as
the other? nay the <hi>Heathen</hi> in St. <hi>Austin</hi>
argued very well,<note place="margin">Aug. de Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit. Dei. l. 10. c. 19.</note> 
               <hi>that Sacrifices being meer
external things might more properly belong
to the Inferiour Deities, but the more invisible
the Deity was, the more invisible the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
were to be, and the greater and better the
Deity, the Sacrifice was to be still proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable:</hi>
and can any man in his senses think
that a meer outward <hi>Sacrifice</hi> is more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to <hi>God,</hi> than the <hi>devotion</hi> of <hi>our
heart</hi> is? and wherein can we better express
that to <hi>God,</hi> than in offering up our <hi>prayers</hi>
to him? so that in all reason the duty of
<hi>prayer</hi> ought to be reserved as more proper
to <hi>God</hi> than any external sacrifice, and those
who did appropriate Sacrifice to <hi>God</hi> did
comprehend <hi>prayer</hi> as the most spiritual
and acceptable part of it:<note place="margin">L. 10. c. 4.</note> So St. <hi>Austin</hi>
speaking of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> due to <hi>God, makes
our heart the Altar, and Christ our Priest,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:45050:101"/>
and our Prayers and Praises to be offered up to
God by a fervent charity; and any work
which is therefore done that thereby we may
be united to God in a holy Communion with
him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">C. 6.</note> 
               <hi>in order to our happiness, to be a true
Sacrifice;</hi> and let any man judge whether
this description do not so naturally agree to
<hi>prayer,</hi> as if it had been only intended for
it. Besides it is observable that <hi>sacrifices</hi> of old
were solemn rites of <hi>supplication;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 21. 33. 26. 25.</note> and <hi>calling
upon the name of the Lord</hi> where Altars were
erected is the main thing spoken of, thence
the <hi>Temple</hi> (though the place of sacrifice)
is called <hi>the house of Prayer;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 56. 7.</note> and where
<hi>God</hi> slights <hi>sacrifices,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 50. 8. 15.</note> he requires <hi>prayer</hi> as
much more acceptable to him. It seems
then very strange that <hi>sacrifice</hi> alone as
distinguished from <hi>prayer</hi> should be that
<hi>Latria</hi> that is proper to God. (3.) Upon
the same account that the <hi>Heathen</hi> did give
divine honour to their <hi>inferiour Deities,</hi>
those in the <hi>Roman Church</hi> do so to <hi>Angels</hi>
and <hi>Saints.</hi> For the <hi>Heathens</hi> made a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in their <hi>sacrifices</hi> to the supreme <hi>God,</hi>
and their inferiour <hi>Deities</hi> and their <hi>Heroes:</hi>
so that if the putting any difference in the
way of religious Worship doth excuse the
one, it must do the other also. Did the
<hi>Heathen</hi> use solemn Ceremonies of making
any capable of <hi>divine worship?</hi> so does the
<hi>Roman Church.</hi> Did they set up their
<hi>Images</hi> in publick places of <hi>worship</hi> and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:45050:102"/>
there kneel before them and invocate those
represented by them? so does the <hi>Roman
Church.</hi> Did they consecrate. Temples
and erect <hi>Altars</hi> to them, and keep Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals
and burn Incense before them? so does
the <hi>Roman Church.</hi> Lastly, did they offer
up <hi>Sacrifices</hi> in those Temples to the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
of their lesser <hi>Deities</hi> and <hi>Heroes?</hi> so
does the <hi>Roman Church.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bell. de Sanct. beat. l. 1. c. 7.</note> For <hi>Bellarmin</hi>
reckoning up the honours belonging to
<hi>Canonized Saints</hi> besides those before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
reckons up this as one, <hi>that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
of the Eucharist, and of lauds and
prayers are publickly offered to God for their
honour.</hi> I would fain understand what the
sacrificing to <hi>one</hi> for the <hi>honour</hi> of <hi>another</hi>
means? To offer Sacrifice <hi>to one for another</hi>
is an intelligible thing, but to Sacrifice <hi>to
one for the honour of another</hi> is a thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
my reach, if that <hi>sacrifice</hi> does not
belong to him for whose <hi>honour</hi> it is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and if the sacrifice do belong to him,
I wonder at the scrupulosity of those who
dare not say they <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to him as well.
For what is <hi>sacrificing</hi> to God, but sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing
<hi>to his honour,</hi> or doing such an act of
Religion with a design to <hi>honour God</hi> by it:
but when men offer a Sacrifice, but not to
honour <hi>God</hi> by it, but the <hi>B. Virgin,</hi> or
any <hi>Saints</hi> or <hi>Angels,</hi> how can that <hi>Sacrifice</hi>
belong to any other but those whose <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
is designed by it? It being then the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:45050:102"/>
opinion and practice of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi>
that Sacrifices are to be offered for the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
of <hi>Saints</hi> or <hi>Angels,</hi> it is evident they
have reserved no part of divine worship
peculiar to <hi>God</hi> himself, any more than the
<hi>Heathen</hi> did. (4.) There can be no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
difference, that the <hi>Heathen</hi> called
those they worshipped <hi>Gods,</hi> but they do
not so in the <hi>Roman Church.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aug. de Civit. Dei. l. 9. c. 23.</note> For St. <hi>Austin</hi>
saith <hi>there was scarce any difference between
the Heathen and them about the name, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Angels might be called Gods or no: for
he thinks that they are called so in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
as well as</hi> Origen: but the Question
was about the thing, whether they were
to be <hi>Worshipped</hi> as <hi>Gods</hi> or no, <hi>i. e.</hi> by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any part of <hi>religious worship</hi> to them?
which they utterly deny. And were I in
the communion of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> I
should much less scruple calling <hi>Canonized
Saints,</hi> or <hi>Angels</hi> by the names of <hi>Gods,</hi>
than giving them the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>Invocation,</hi>
or the <hi>honour</hi> of <hi>Sacrifices:</hi> but in so doing
they are not only condemned by plain <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi>
and <hi>reason,</hi> but by those of the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church</hi> who writ against the <hi>Heathen
Idolatry:</hi> which was the thing to be
shewed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 13. 2. Another disparity is insisted on by
him,<note place="margin">Of the practice of Invocation in the Church of <hi>Roms.</hi>
                  </note> which is, as to the</hi> manner of Worship.
And as to this, <hi>he saith,</hi> all that they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
by formal invocation, is desiring or pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:45050:103"/>
those Iust persons, who are in glory in
heaven to pray for us; and if the Catholicks
be guilty of Idolatry in this, we must not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
the prayers of a just man even in this life,
because this formal Invocation will be to make
him an inferiour Deitie. <hi>To shew the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
weakness of this answer, I shall prove
these two things. 1. That those in the</hi>
Church <hi>of</hi> Rome <hi>do allow and practise ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kind of</hi> formal Invocation <hi>from what
he asserts. 2. That supposing this were
all, it would not excuse them, and that it is
of a very different nature from</hi> desiring the
prayers of just men for us in this life.</p>
            <p>1. That they do allow and practise ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kind of <hi>formal Invocation</hi> from what
he asserts. He might very well say, he did
understand well what I meant by <hi>formal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,</hi>
when he makes this to be the
meaning of it; for never any person before
him imagined that sense of it; And that
term of <hi>formal Invocation</hi> was purposely
chosen by me, to distinguish it from the
<hi>rhetorical Apostrophe's</hi> of some of the <hi>Greek
Fathers,</hi> the <hi>Poetical Flourishes,</hi> of <hi>Damasus,
Prudentius,</hi> and <hi>Paulinus;</hi> from <hi>general
wishes</hi> that the <hi>Saints</hi> would pray for us.
Of which are some instances, in good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors;
from <hi>assemblies at the monuments of
Martyrs,</hi> which were usual in ancient
times; and that which I thought any man
would understand by it was that which is
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:45050:103"/>
constantly practised in the <hi>Roman Church.
viz.</hi> in places and times purposely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>religious worship,</hi>
with all the same external signes of <hi>devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
which we use to <hi>God</hi> himself, to offer
up our <hi>Prayers to Saints,</hi> or <hi>Angels</hi> to help
us in our necessities as well as to pray to
<hi>God</hi> for us. The former part none can
be ignorant of, that have but so much as
heard of the devotion of the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>Rome;</hi> all the difficulty lies in that, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>they pray to them to help their necessities</hi>
as well <hi>as pray for them?</hi> And so many
<hi>forms</hi> of Prayer allowed and practised in
their <hi>Church</hi> have been so often objected
to them, wherein these things are manifest,
that I cannot but wonder this should be
denyed. Do they believe, we never look
into their <hi>Breviaries, Rosaries, Houres,</hi> and
other Books of Devotion, wherein to this
day such Prayers are to be found? Do they
think we never heard of the <hi>Offices</hi> of the
<hi>B. Virgin,</hi> or our <hi>Ladies Psalter</hi> a Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Book, never yet censured, wherein
the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> in their highest strains of
<hi>Prayer</hi> to <hi>God</hi> are applyed to the <hi>V. Mary?</hi>
I have known my self intelligent persons
of their <hi>Church</hi> who commit their souls to
the <hi>V. Maries</hi> protection every day, as we
do to <hi>Almighty Gods:</hi> and such who thought
they understood the doctrine and practice
of their <hi>Church</hi> as well as others. But,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:45050:104"/>
               <hi>Madam,</hi> these are mysteries not to be known
till they have their <hi>Proselytes</hi> safe and fast
enough, then by degrees they let them
know, what is to be done, when they
have given away all liberty of judging for
themselves. Then it is no matter what
they are commanded or expected to do,
they must do as others do, or else their
sincerity is questioned, and they are thought
<hi>Hereticks</hi> in their hearts, whatever they
profess. I shall not insist upon any ancient
<hi>Breviaries,</hi> or obsolete <hi>Forms,</hi> or private
<hi>Devotions,</hi> which yet they are accountable
for, till they do condemn them. I need
no more than the present <hi>Roman Breviary</hi>

the <hi>Apostles</hi> in <hi>Scripture</hi> being said <hi>to save
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:45050:105"/>
men,</hi> do shew what shifts a bad cause will
put a man to: For will any man in his
wits say the case is the same in ordinary
<hi>speech</hi> and in <hi>prayer?</hi> Is it all one, for a
man to say, that his Staff helped him in his
going, and to fall down upon his knees to
pray to his Staff to help him? <hi>God</hi> did use
the <hi>Apostles</hi> as <hi>instruments</hi> on earth to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the salvation of mankind, but may
we therefore <hi>pray</hi> to them now in Heaven
to save us? May we not truly say, that
the <hi>Sun</hi> enlightens the world, but may we
therefore pray to the <hi>Sun</hi> to enlighten us?
No, the <hi>Sun</hi> is but <hi>Gods instrument,</hi> and our
addresses must be in prayer to the Supream
<hi>Lord</hi> over all. But to take his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of praying to them for these
things: <hi>i. e. praying to them that they
would pray to God for them, as we desire one
another to pray:</hi> would not that man be
condemned of gross <hi>Idolatry,</hi> or prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
folly, who instead of desiring his
<hi>Friends</hi> to <hi>pray</hi> to <hi>God</hi> for the pardon of
his sins, and the assistance of <hi>Divine Grace,</hi>
should say to them, <hi>I pray you pardon my
sins, and assist me with the Grace of God?</hi>
What would St. <hi>Paul</hi> have said to such
men that should have asked such things
of him, who yet saith, <hi>that he was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of saving some?</hi>

§. 14. 2. Supposing this were all that
were done and allowed in the <hi>Roman
Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween praying to Saints in Heaven, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring men on Earth to pray for us.</note> yet this would not excuse them:
for their practice is very different in their
<hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> from <hi>desiring our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
on Earth to pray for us.</hi> And I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but wonder, how any men of common
sense can suffer themselves to be imposed
upon so easily in this matter. For is there
really no difference in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> desiring his
Brethren <hi>to pray for him,</hi> as he often did;
and a mans falling down upon his knees
with all the solemnity of devotion he uses
to God himself, to St. <hi>Paul</hi> to desire him
to pray for him, when he was present up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
earth, and did certainly know what he
desired of him? Suppose in the midst of
the solemn devotions of the <hi>Church</hi> where
St. <hi>Peter</hi> or St. <hi>Paul</hi> had been present, the
<hi>Letanies</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> had been then as
they are now; and after they had prayed
to the persons of the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
should with the same postures and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of devotion have immediately
turned themselves to the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and cryed
only <hi>Peter and Paul pray for us;</hi> do you
think, this would have been acceptable to
them? No doubt St. <hi>Peter</hi> would have
been less pleased with this, than with <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius,</hi>

only <hi>falling down before him,</hi> and
<hi>yet then he bid him stand up, I my self also
am a man.</hi> They who impute this only to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:45050:106"/>
his <hi>modesty,</hi> will not allow him to carry it
to Heaven with him; For they suppose him
to be very well pleased with that honour
in Heaven, which he refused on earth.
And St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have rent his garments
and cryed out, as he did to the men of
<hi>Lystra,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 14. 14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>Why do ye these things; we also are
men of like passions with you?</hi> They would
not receive any honour that might in the
least seem to incroach upon the <hi>divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi>
and yet they might upon better
grounds have done it to them on earth,
than now in Heaven, because they were
then sure they heard them, which now
they can never be. And would it not be
a senseless thing to desire some excellent
person in the <hi>Indies,</hi> when we are at our
solemn devotion to pray for us, because it
is possible <hi>God</hi> may at the same time reveal
our minds to him? I would willingly
be informed, if we had assurance of
the <hi>Sanctity</hi> of a person in this life, as
great as they have in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> of
those they invocate; whether there would
be any evil at all in publick places of
worship, and at the time used for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God, to set such a person up in
some higher place of the Church, to burn
incense before him, to prostrate themselves
with hands and eyes lifted up to him, if at
last they pretended, that all that time they
only <hi>prayed to him, to pray for them?</hi> And
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:45050:107"/>
certainly a good man is much more the
<hi>Image of God,</hi> and deserves more reverence
than all the artificial <hi>Images</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> or
of <hi>God</hi> himself. If they will condemn
this, they may conceive, that supposing,
<hi>they only prayed to Saints in their devotions
to pray for them,</hi> this would not excuse
them: For they do it in those places, at
such times, and in such a manner as highly
incroaches upon the worship and service
due to <hi>God</hi> alone.</p>
            <p>§. 15. 2. I now come to consider,<note place="margin">St. <hi>Austin</hi> no Friend to Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saints.</note> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the answer given by St. <hi>Austin</hi> will
vindicate them, and whether invocation of
Saints, as it is now practised in the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>Rome</hi> were allowed, or in <hi>use</hi> then?
Here he tells us, <hi>That</hi> Faustus <hi>the Manichean
calumniates the Catholicks (the word is</hi>
St. <hi>Austins</hi> he saith, and we do not quarrel
with the word, but that they are not such
<hi>Catholicks</hi> as St. <hi>Austin</hi> speaks of) <hi>because
they honoured the Memories or Shrines of
Martyrs, charged them to have turned the
Idols into Martyrs, whom they worshipped
said he with like vows.</hi> To shew how ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
far what St. <hi>Austin</hi> saith, is from justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
the present practices of the <hi>Roman
Church,</hi> we need no more than barely to
represent what St. <hi>Austin</hi> affirms, and what
he denyes. He affirms, that it was the
custom of the <hi>Christians</hi> in his time to have
their religious Assemblies at the <hi>Sepulchres</hi>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:45050:107"/>
or <hi>Memories</hi> of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> where the
place it self would raise their affections,
and quicken their love towards the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi>
and towards <hi>God;</hi> but he utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes,
that any <hi>religious worship</hi> was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
to the <hi>Martyrs:</hi> for neither was
any Sacrifice offered up to any of them, nor
any other part of <hi>religious worship:</hi> for
thereupon he shews (which is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently
left out in the citation) <hi>that
not only Sacrifice was refused by Saints and
Angels, but any other religious honour
which is due to God himself, as the Angel
forbad</hi> St. <hi>Iohn to fall down and worship
him. All the worship</hi> therefore, he saith,
that they give to Saints is, <hi>That of love and
society, and of the same kind which we give
to holy men in this life, who are ready to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
for the truth of the Gospel.</hi> But that the
worship of <hi>Invocation</hi> is expresly excluded
by St. <hi>Austin,</hi> appears by what himself saith
on a like occasion; where he shews the
difference between the <hi>Gentiles</hi> worship and
theirs:<note place="margin">Aug. de Civit. Dei, l. 20. c. 10.</note> 
               <hi>They</hi> (saith he) <hi>build Temples,
erect Altars, appoint Priests, and offer Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices;
but we erect no Temples to Martyrs as
to Gods, but Memories as to dead men whose
Spirits live with God; we raise no Altars
on which to sacrifice to Martyrs, but to one
God, the God of Martyrs as well as ours, at
which as men of God who have overcome the
world by confessing him, they are named in
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:45050:108"/>
their place and order, but are not invocated
by the Priest who sacrifices.</hi> And elsewhere
saith,<note place="margin">L. 8. 6. 27.</note> 
               <hi>Whatever the Christians do at the
memories of the Martyrs, is for ornaments to
those memories, not as any sacred Rites
or Sacrifices belonging to the dead as Gods:
we therefore do not worship our Martyrs with
divine honours, nor with the faults of men,
as the Gentiles did their Gods.</hi> Which gave
occasion to <hi>Lud. Vives</hi> in his Notes on that
<hi>Chapter</hi> to say, that <hi>many Christians in his
time</hi> (what sort of <hi>Catholicks</hi> those were, it
is easie to guess, but to be sure, none of
St. <hi>Austins) did no otherwise worship Saints,
than they did God himself; neither could he
see in many things any difference between the
opinion they had of Saints, and what the
Gentiles had of their Gods.</hi> I cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
then how St. <hi>Austins</hi> answer
should justifie that which he condemns:
He denyes that there was an <hi>Invocation</hi> of
<hi>Saints,</hi> but only a <hi>commemoration</hi> of them;
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> pleads for any <hi>Invocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of them, and condemns all those who
deny it. So that his answer is very far
from clearing the <hi>Roman Church</hi> in the
practice of <hi>Invocation,</hi> and the objection
we make against it, that it doth parallel
the <hi>Heathen Idolatry;</hi> for it grants, it would
do so, if they gave to the <hi>Saints</hi> the <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>
due to <hi>God,</hi> of which he makes <hi>Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
to be a part.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:45050:108"/>
But after all this, can we imagine, that
he should practise himself contrary to his
own doctrine? <hi>Yes,</hi> saith he, <hi>he made a
prayer to</hi> St. Cyprian,<note place="margin">Aug. de bapt. c. Don. l. 7. c. 1.</note> 
               <hi>let Blessed</hi> Cyprian
<hi>therefore help us in our prayers.</hi> But is there
no difference to be made between such an
<hi>Apostrophe</hi> to a person in ones writing and
solemn supplication to him with all the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>emnity
of devotion in the duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
worship? If I should now say, Let
St. <hi>Austin</hi> now help me in his prayers,
while I am defending his constant opinion,
that <hi>Invocation</hi> is proper to <hi>God</hi> alone,
would they take this for renouncing the
<hi>Protestant</hi> doctrine, and embracing that of
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome?</hi> I doubt they would
not think that I escaped the <hi>Anathema</hi> of
the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> for all this. The
Question between us, is not how far such
wishes rather than prayers were thought
allowable being uttered occasionally, as
St. <hi>Austin</hi> doth this to St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> but
whether solemn <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints</hi> in the
duties of Religious worship, as it is now
practised in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, were ever
practised in St. <hi>Austins</hi> time, and this we
utterly deny. We do not say, that they
did not then believe, that the Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
did pray for them, and that some of
them did express their wishes, that they
would pray particularly for them, we do
not say, that some superstitions did not
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:45050:109"/>
creep in after the Anniversary meetings at
the <hi>Sepulchres</hi> of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> grew in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest;
for St. <hi>Austin</hi> himself saith, <hi>that
what they taught was one thing, and what
they did bear with was another,</hi>
               <note place="margin">C. Faust. l. 20. c. 2.</note> speaking of
the customes used at those solemnities:
But here we stand, and fix our foot against
all opposition whatsoever, that there was
no such doctrine or practice allowed in
the <hi>Church</hi> at that time, as is owned and
approved at this day in the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>Rome.</hi> But from St. <hi>Austin</hi> we are sent to
<hi>Calvin,</hi> whose authority (though never
owned as infallible by us) we need not
fear in this point:<note place="margin">Calv. Instit. l. 3. c. 20. n. 22.</note> and I cannot but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
if he saw the words in <hi>Calvin</hi> or <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin,</hi>
that he would produce them. For
<hi>Calvin</hi> doth there say,<note place="margin">Bell. de Beatit. sanct. l. 1. c. 16.</note> 
               <hi>That the Council of</hi>
Carthage <hi>did forbid praying to Saints, lest
the publick prayers should be corrupted by
such kind of addresses, Holy</hi> Peter <hi>pray for
us.</hi> If St. <hi>Austin</hi> were present in this
<hi>Council,</hi> as my Adversary saith <hi>he was,</hi> I
wonder what advantage it will be to him
from <hi>Calvins</hi> saying, that the <hi>Council</hi> did
condemn and forbid those prayers; which
were in use by some of the people. But
it seems, he takes the peoples part against
the <hi>Council</hi> and St. <hi>Austin</hi> too; and thinks
it enough for them to follow the practices
condemned by <hi>Councils</hi> and <hi>Fathers;</hi> which
we are sure they do, and are glad to find
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:45050:109"/>
so ingenuous a confession of it. He may
as well the next time bring St. <hi>Austins</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
for worshipping <hi>Martyrs</hi> and
<hi>Images,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De Morib. Eccl. Cath. c. 34.</note> because he saith, <hi>he knew many who
adored Sepulchres and Pictures:</hi> and for the
worship of <hi>Angels,</hi> because he saith, <hi>he had
heard of many,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Confess. l. 10. cap. 42.</note> 
               <hi>who had tryed to go to God
by praying to Angels, and were thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to fall into delusions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 16. But the strangest effort of all the
rest,<note place="margin">Of Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive points of faith.</note> is what he hath reserved to the last
place, <hi>viz. That the charge of Idolatry against
them must be vain and groundless, because if I
be pressed close, I shall deny any one of these Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
points to be divine truths;</hi> viz. <hi>that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
is not to be given to the Images of
Christ and his Saints, that what appears to
be bread in the Eucharist is not the body of
Christ, that it is not lawful to Invocate the
Saints to pray for us.</hi> But the answer to
this is so easie, that it will not require much
time to dispatch it. For I do assert it to
be an Article of my faith, <hi>That God alone
is to be worshipped with divine and religious
worship:</hi> and he that cannot hence infer, that
no created Being is to be so worshipped,
hath the name of reasonable creature given
him to no purpose. What need we make
<hi>Negative Articles of faith,</hi> where the <hi>Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative</hi>
do necessarily imply them? If I
believe that the <hi>Scripture</hi> is my only rule
of faith, as I most firmly do; will any
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:45050:110"/>
man that considers what he saith, require
me to make <hi>Negative Articles of faith,</hi> that
the <hi>Pope</hi> is not, <hi>Tradition</hi> is not, <hi>Councils</hi>
are not, a private <hi>Spirit</hi> is not? for all
these things are necessarily implyed therein.
And so for all particular doctrines reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by us upon this principle, we do not
make them <hi>Negative points of faith,</hi> but
we therefore refuse the belief of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
not contained in our only rule of
faith: On this account we reject the <hi>Popes
Supremacy, Transubstantiation, Infalibility
of the present Church in delivering points of
faith, Purgatory,</hi> and other fopperies im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
upon the belief of <hi>Christians.</hi> So
that the short resolution of our <hi>faith</hi> is
this, that we ought to believe nothing as
an Article of faith, but what <hi>God</hi> hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,
and that the compleat revelation of
<hi>Gods</hi> will to us is contained in the <hi>Bible;</hi>
and the resolution of our worship, is into
this principle, that <hi>God</hi> alone is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
with divine and religious worship,
and therefore whether they be <hi>Saints</hi> or
<hi>Angels, Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> whether the
<hi>Elements</hi> of a Sacrament, or of the
World, whether Crosses, and Reliques, or
Woods and Fountains, or any sort of
Images; in a word, no creature whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is to be worshipped with religious
worship, because that is proper to <hi>God</hi>
alone. And if this principle will excuse
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:45050:110"/>
them from <hi>Idolatry.</hi> I desire him to make
the best of it. And if he gives no more
satisfactory answer hereafter, than he hath
already done, the greatest charity I can
use to those of that <hi>Church,</hi> is to wish them
repentance, which I most heartily do.</p>

            <head>CHAP. III. Of the hindrance of a good Life and
Devotion in the Roman Church.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>The doctrines of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
to Piety. The Sacrament of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
as taught among them, destroys the
necessity of a good life. The doctrine of
Purgatory takes away the care of it, as
appears by the true stating it, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
that doctrine with Protestants.
How easie it is, according to them, for a
rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Purgatory dreadful to none but
poor and friendless. Sincerity of devotion
hindred by prayers in an unknown
Tongue. The great absurdity of it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested.
The effects of our Ancestors de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
had been as great, if they had said
their prayers in English. The language
of prayer proved to be no indifferent thing,
from <hi>St. Pauls</hi> arguments. No universal
consent for prayers in an unknown tongue,
by the confession of their own Writers. Of
their doctrine of the efficacy of Sacraments,
that it takes away all necessity of devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the minds of the receivers. This
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:45050:111"/>
complained of by <hi>Cassander</hi> and <hi>Arnaud,</hi>
but proved against them to be the doctrine
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, by the Canons of
the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> The great easiness
of getting Grace by their Sacraments.
Of their discouraging the reading the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.
A standing Rule of devotion ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.
None so fit to give it, as God
himself: This done by him in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.
All persons therefore concerned to
read them. The arguments against read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Scriptures, would have held against
the publishing them in a language known
to the people. The dangers as great then,
as ever have been since. The greatest pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is wholly to
forbid the Scriptures; being acknowledged
by their wisest men, to be so contrary to
their Interest. The confession of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals
at <hi>Bononia</hi> to that purpose. The
avowed practice of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church
herein directly contrary to that of the
Primitive: although the reasons were as
great then from the danger of Heresies.
This confessed by their own Writers.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>§. 1. 2. THe second Reason I gave,
why persons run so great a
hazard of their salvation in the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> was, because that
<hi>Church</hi> is guilty of so great corruption of
the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> by opinions and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:45050:112"/>
which are very apt to hinder a good
life, which is necessary to salvation. But,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>This necessity</hi> I said,<note place="margin">Of the Sacrament of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of a good life.</note> was taken off
by their making the <hi>Sacrament of Pennance</hi>
joyned with contrition, sufficient for sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
Here he saith, <hi>That Protestants do
make contrition alone, which is less, suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for salvation, and our Church allowing
confession and absolution (which make the
Sacrament of Pennance) in case of trouble
of conscience, they being added to contrition,
cannot make it of a malignant nature.</hi> To
this I answer: That contrition alone is not
by us made sufficient for salvation. For
we believe, that as no man can be saved
without true repentance, so that true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
doth not lye meerly in contrition
for sins. For <hi>godly sorrow</hi> in Scripture, is
said, <hi>to work repentance to salvation, not to
be repented of;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 10.</note> and it cannot be the cause
and effect both together. <hi>Repentance</hi> in
Scripture implyes a <hi>forsaking of sin,</hi> (as
it were very easie to prove, if it be thought
necessary) and without this we know not
what ground any man hath to hope for the
pardon of it, although he confess it, and
be absolved a thousand times over; and
have remorse in his mind for it, when
he doth confess it. And therefore I had
cause to say, that they of the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> destroy the necessity of a good life,
when they declare a man to be in a state of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:45050:112"/>
salvation, if he hath a bare <hi>contrition</hi> for
his sins, and confess them to the Priest, and
be absolved by him. For to what end
should a man put himself to the trouble of
mortifying his passions and forsaking his
sins, if he commits them again, he knows a
present remedy, <hi>toties quoties;</hi> it is but
confessing with sorrow, and upon absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he is as whole, as if he had not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
And is it possible to imagine a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
that more effectually overthrows
the <hi>necessity</hi> of a <hi>good life,</hi> than this doth?
I cannot but think, if this doctrine were
true, all the Precepts of <hi>Holiness</hi> in the
<hi>Christian Religion</hi> were insignificant things:
But this is a doctrine fitted to make all
that are <hi>bad,</hi> and willing to continue so, to
be their <hi>Proselytes;</hi> when so cheap and easie
a way of salvation is believed by them:
especially if we enquire into the explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this doctrine among the <hi>Doctors</hi> of
that <hi>Church.</hi>

than in the words of Bishop <hi>Taylor,</hi> whom
he deservedly calls <hi>an eminent leading man
among the Protestants,</hi> where after he hath
mentioned their doctrines about contrition,
<q>The sequel of all (he saith) is this, that
if a man live a wicked life for sixty or
eighty years together, yet if in the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of his death, sooner than which God
(say they) hath not commanded him to
repent, by being a little sorrowful for his
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:45050:113"/>
sins, then resolving for the present that
he will do so no more; and though this
sorrow hath in it no love of God, but
only a fear of Hell, and a hope that God
will pardon him; this, if the Priest ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
him, doth instantly pass him into a
state of salvation. The Priest with two
Fingers and a Thumb can do his work
for him; only he must be greatly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
and disposed to receive it: great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we say according to the sense of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church; for he must be attrite,
or it were better, he were contrite; one
act of grief, a little one, and that not
for one sin more than for another, and
this at the end of a wicked long life, at
the time of our death will make all sure.
Upon these terms, it is a wonder that all
wicked men in the world are not Papists,
where they may live so merrily, and dye
so securely, and are out of all danger,
unless peradventure they dye very sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly,
which because so very few do,
the venture is esteemed nothing, and it
is a thousand to one on the sinners
side.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But we dare not flatter men so into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
misery; we cannot but declare to
them the necessity of a sincere repentance
and holy life in order to salvation: and
that we cannot absolve those, whom God
hath declared he will not absolve. Indeed
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:45050:113"/>
for the satisfaction of truly penitent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
our <hi>Church</hi> approves of applying the
<hi>Promises</hi> of <hi>Pardon</hi> in <hi>Scripture</hi> to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
case of those persons; which is that
we mean by <hi>absolution.</hi> But if they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
they can absolve whether <hi>God</hi> will or
no; we must leave <hi>God</hi> and <hi>them</hi> to dispute
the point.</p>
            <p>§. 2. 2. I said the care of a good life
was taken off among them,<note place="margin">The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Purgatory takes away the care of a good life.</note> by supposing
an expiation of sin (by the prayers of the
living) after death. <hi>No,</hi> saith he, <hi>it is
rather apt to increase it, because of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
pains the sinner is to sustain after
death, if there be not a perfect expiation of sin
in this life by works of pennance; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he be ascertained by faith, that he
may be holpen by the charitable suffrages
of the faithful living, yet this is no more
encouragement to him to sin, than it would
be to a Spend-thrift to run into debt and to
be cast into prison, because he knows he may
be relieved by the charity of his friends.
If he were sure there were no prison for
him, that would be an encouragement
indeed to play the Spend-thrift, and this</hi> he
saith, <hi>is the case of the Protestants in denyal
of Purgatory.</hi> One would think by this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
we <hi>Protestants</hi> had a very pleasant
<hi>Religion,</hi> and that we held nothing could
affright a sinner from continuing in his
sins, because we destroy <hi>Purgatory:</hi> but we
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:45050:114"/>
had thought there had been something
more dreadful in the <hi>torments of Hell,</hi> than
in the flames of <hi>Purgatory.</hi> But if our plain
doctrine, that every impenitent sinner must
expect no less than eternal vengeance in
another world, will not prevail upon men
to leave their sins, and lead a good life, can
we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>magine a groundless fiction of <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi>
should ever do it? Especially, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the true stating of the doctrine of
<hi>Purgatory</hi> among them, by which we shall
easily discern what obligation it layes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
men to <hi>Holiness</hi> of life. <q>There are
(say they) two sorts of sins which men
are guilty of, some of which are in their
own nature <hi>venial,</hi> and so do not deserve
eternal punishment, and for these a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
and vertual repentance is sufficient:
but there are other which they call <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
sins,</hi> which have a debt and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to eternal punishment belonging to
them; but this <hi>eternal punishment</hi> is
changed into <hi>temporal,</hi> by the <hi>Sacrament
of Pennance;</hi> but still this <hi>temporal</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
must be undergone either in
<hi>this life,</hi> or that <hi>to come;</hi> if a man do
not satisfie in <hi>this life,</hi> and cannot get
help enough out of the <hi>stock</hi> of the
<hi>Church</hi> to do it for him; there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
to <hi>Purgatory</hi> he must go: and if
he be not helped by his Friends on earth,
God knows how long he may stay there;
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:45050:114"/>
but then he is to blame that he took no
more care for his soul when he lived, if
not by a holy life, yet by leaving no more
to those whose Office it should be, to
procure him a deliverance thence.</q> Judge
now <hi>Madam,</hi> if this be not a very fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
doctrine, especially to those, who are
<hi>poor</hi> and <hi>friendless.</hi> But in case a man be
<hi>rich</hi> enough to provide <hi>Masses</hi> to be said
for his soul, and that he hath a good <hi>stock</hi>
of <hi>Indulgences</hi> before hand, for some <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands</hi>
of years, he may make a pretty tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
shift in <hi>Purgatory,</hi> especially in these
last <hi>Ages</hi> of the world; wherein it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
it may not be near so long to the
day of judgement (when the final sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
is to be pronounced) as he hath got
years of <hi>Indulgences</hi> already. I pray what
need a person be afraid of, that lives a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
bad life, according to these principles?
Must he suffer for his <hi>Original sin?</hi> No,
that, guilt and punishment, and all is clear
done away in <hi>Baptism.</hi> Must he suffer for
his <hi>Venial sins?</hi> That were strange, if he
had never any <hi>general repentance</hi> for
them. Need he be afraid of the
dreadful sentence of the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Go ye cursed into everlasting
flames?</hi> He is a <hi>Fool</hi> indeed, that by a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
present <hi>contrition</hi> and <hi>confession,</hi> will not
obtain <hi>absolution</hi> from a <hi>Priest,</hi> and in a
trice the <hi>eternal</hi> flames are extinguished,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:45050:115"/>
and only some <hi>temporal</hi> punishment succeeds
in the <hi>room</hi> of them. But it would seem
somewhat hard to a voluptuous man how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
to be put to severe <hi>pennances;</hi> is there
no remedy in this case? Yes, there is a
<hi>stock</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> and if he will not
procure help for himself thence by some
plenary <hi>Indulgences,</hi> if he will not bear it
here, he must in another world. What
then? Is he past all hope of remedy there?
That is according to his <hi>Purse</hi> and <hi>Friends.
How easie is it for a rich man to enter into
the Kingdom of God?</hi> But we have no such
easie way of escaping the miseries of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
life: we dare not tell men they may
be relieved there by <hi>Masses</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices,</hi>
and I know not what: our doctrine is
plain and agreeable to the most obvious
and easie sense of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> if men be good
here, they shall be happy afterwards; if
they be bad, and continue so, they shall be
certainly miserable, and unavoidably so.
But for those who are neither good nor
bad, (if any such can be) neither sincere
nor hypocrites, neither penitent nor impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
we leave them to take care of them:
our Saviour hath only declared, that those
who are good, sincere, and penitent, shall
be happy; those who are otherwise, must
be miserable: if they have found out some
wayes for them to escape notwithstanding,
at their peril be it, who relye upon them.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:45050:115"/>
But for others, we understand no more
how punishment in another life should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
after the guilt of sin is pardoned, than
how a shadow should continue, when the
body is gone: for punishment follows
guilt, as the shadow the body. And if
pardon of sin signifies any thing, it is taking
away the punishment we were obnoxious
to by reason of sin. But how that man
should be said to have his <hi>debt</hi> forgiven,
who is cast into Prison for it, only where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he might have lain and rotted there,
his <hi>Creditor</hi> tells him, he shall endure the
same misery, but he shall escape at last, is a
thing no man would believe, who suffered
in such a case. He might indeed say, that
he did not exercise the utmost rigour of
<hi>Iustice,</hi> but would hardly be brought to
magnifie the infinite clemency and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his <hi>Creditor.</hi> But we that desire to
understand the way of salvation as it is
delivered by our <hi>Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> and to
be saved in that way, cannot for our hearts
understand any more by his doctrine, but
that men shall be saved, if they believe and
obey his doctrine, and shall be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if they do it not. We find nothing of
<hi>half saving</hi> and <hi>half damning</hi> men, such as
the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Purgatory</hi> is believed to be in
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> For the pains of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
therein are said to be as great as the
damned in Hell, and yet all this while <hi>God</hi>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:45050:116"/>
is their <hi>Friend,</hi> and they are sure to be
saved. They had need in such a case call
in the help of their <hi>Friends</hi> on earth, if <hi>God</hi>
be so ill a <hi>Friend</hi> in <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And can he not believe, that it is a far
greater encouragement to a <hi>Spend-thrift</hi> to
be told indeed of a dreadful Prison, but
such as if he leaves but money behind him
to imploy his friends in begging his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
he shall be surely delivered; than to
be assured if he continues his folly, there
will be no redemption or hopes of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,
when he is once cast into it. I
dare appeal to any one who can but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
what we speak of, whether of
these two, is the more probable way of
reclaiming a man from riotous courses?
but that which is beyond this, is, that the
one is most certainly true, the other but
a meer figment of the brains of men, who
have contrived a way to bring wicked men
to Heaven at last, although somewhat the
farther way about, and it must cost them
dear, for their <hi>Friends</hi> to help them
through.</p>
            <p>§. 3. 3. After I had shewed how much the
necessity and care of a good life were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
by the principles of the <hi>Roman
Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sincerity of devotion hindered by prayers in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Tongue.</note> I proceeded to shew, how the
<hi>sincerity of devotion</hi> was hindered among
them by several particulars.</p>
            <p>1. By prayers in a language which many
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:45050:116"/>
understand not. <hi>To this he answers,</hi> If I
speak of private prayers, all Catholicks are
taught to say them in their Mother Tongue:
If of the publick prayers of the Church, he
understands not why it may not be done with
as much sincerity of devotion, the people
joyning their intention and particular prayers
with the Priest, as their Embassadour to
God, as if they understood him; he is sure
the effects of a sincere devotion for nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years together, which this manner of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
produced in this Nation, were much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from those we have seen since the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
the publick Liturgy into English: for
which he instances in building and endowing
Churches, Colledges, Religious Houses, and
the conversion of several Nations by English
Missionaries. But this, <hi>he saith,</hi> is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Discipline, and not to be regulated by
the fancies of private men, but the judgement
of the Church: and withal is confessed by
some Protestants,<note place="margin">Preface to the <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glott</hi> Bible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1655.</note> that most Sects of Christians
have the Scriptures, Liturgies and Rituals in
a Tongue unknown but to the Learned; and
therefore according to <hi>St. Austin,</hi> it is inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
madness to dispute that which is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented
by the whole Church through the
world. <hi>For our more distinct proceeding
in answer to this, three things are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered:
1. Whether praying in a known
or unknown tongue, do more conduce to
devotion? 2. Whether this whole matter
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:45050:117"/>
be a thing left in the power of the</hi> Church
<hi>to determine? 3. Whether prayers in an
unknown tongue, be universally received
in all other parts of the</hi> Christian <hi>world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Whether of these conduce more to
devotion, is our main enquiry. And if
praying in an <hi>unknown tongue</hi> doth so, I
wonder he tells us, <hi>that all Catholicks are
taught to say them in their Mother-tongue:</hi>
Why so I pray? Is it that by understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what they speak, their minds might be
more attentive, and their affections more
raised in the desires of the things they pray
for? And will not the same arguments
more hold for publick prayer, wherein all
the Congregation are to joyn together?
So that their private prayers condemn their
publick, unless <hi>Latin</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> be of
greater force, than uttered in a <hi>Closet.</hi>
But can it enter into the minds of any
men, who consider what the end of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together to <hi>pray</hi> is, that such an end
should as much or more be attained, where
people know not what they say, as where
they do? If all the business of <hi>Christian
worship</hi> were only to patter over a few
words (as if there were no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>prayers</hi> and <hi>charms)</hi> what he saith,
were to some purpose: but that is so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable
a thing to <hi>Christian Religion,</hi>
that it is hard to say, whether they have
more corrupted the <hi>doctrine</hi> or the <hi>devotion</hi>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:45050:117"/>
of the <hi>Christian Church.</hi> If I saw a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of <hi>Indians</hi> met together with their
<hi>Priest</hi> among them, using many antick ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures
and Mimical postures, and speaking
many words which the people muttered
after him, but understood not what they
said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I might probably suspect they were
<hi>conjuring,</hi> but should hardly believe them,
if they called that <hi>praying.</hi> I could not
but enquire of them, what they meant by
<hi>praying?</hi> If they told me, saying so many
hard words, which they understood not,
I had done with them, but should shrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
suspect the <hi>knavery</hi> of their <hi>Priests.</hi> If
they told me, by <hi>praying</hi> they meant, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
their desires of the things they stood
in need of to the God they worshipped,</hi> I
could not but ask of them, whether it
were not necessary for them to <hi>know</hi> what
it was they asked, or how could they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
they knew not what? Or whether the
<hi>God</hi> they worshipped, understood only that
<hi>one tongue,</hi> and so they were fain to speak
to him, in his own language? This I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
were a sufficient reason, and in that
case the people were to be pittied, if they
could not learn that tongue themselves.
But supposing all languages equally known
to him we make our addresses to, why
should not the people use that, which they
understand themselves? Are their prayers
like counterfeit <hi>Iewels,</hi> that the less they
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:45050:118"/>
understand them, the better they like them?
It may justly give men some suspicion, that
there are not fair dealings, where so little
light is allowed to judge by: and that <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion</hi>
commended most, which <hi>Ignorance</hi>
is the Mother of. We think it as unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
to desire the people to say <hi>Amen</hi> to
prayers they know not the meaning of, as
for men to set their hands to <hi>Petitions</hi>
without reading what is contained in them.
It is a great chance if they do not mistake
to their own great prejudice, and do what
they repent of afterwards. We declare,
that our meeting together to worship <hi>God,</hi>
is to joyn together our hearty prayers,
which the more the people understand, the
better their minds are satisfied in what
they desire, and the more fervent will their
supplications be. If it be enough for <hi>some
to understand</hi> them, it may as well be enough
for <hi>some to pray</hi> them; if their <hi>prayers</hi> who
understand them, prevail for those who do
not, then it is no matter at all whether
they be <hi>present</hi> or no, unless the efficacy of
the others prayers be confined within the
walls where they meet. And if their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
be most prevalent who understand most,
then it were ten times better, if all the
people understood what they prayed for:
and it must necessarily follow, that praying
in an unknown tongue, is a great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structer
of the devotion of the people, and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:45050:118"/>
that which hinders the efficacy of their
prayers. If it be enough for the people
to be present, and to pray their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
prayers there in publick, to what
End is there any publick <hi>Liturgy</hi> at
all? Why should not all of them be at
their private prayers together? Why
should the <hi>Priest</hi> with his <hi>Iargon</hi> of hard
words interrupt them? for it can be no
more to them who know not what he
saith; and why may they not as well say
their private prayers at the <hi>chiming of Bells,</hi>
as at the <hi>words</hi> of a <hi>Priest,</hi> for they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
both alike, and both seem to sound
as such wise people will have them.</p>
            <p>But he tells us, <hi>The effects of this devotion
were admirable in the charitable and pious
works of our Ancestors, who used this way
so many Ages together.</hi> I pray <hi>Madam,</hi>
ask him, whether he really thinks, they
would have done none of those things, if
they had said their <hi>prayers</hi> in <hi>English?</hi> If
they would not, I do much admire the
force of the <hi>Latin Tongue:</hi> If they would,
then that was not the cause, and so these
things do not prove what they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for. And so <hi>Tenterden Steeple</hi> was
not the cause of <hi>Goodwin Sands.</hi> We do
not go about to disparage our <hi>Ancestors,</hi>
we bless <hi>God</hi> for the good they did; but do
not think that doth oblige us to think them
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:45050:119"/>
infallible in their opinions, or without
fault in all their practices: But our true
<hi>Ancestors</hi> in <hi>Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> are <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
and the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> and all these
are yielded to be of our side, by the most
zealous <hi>Adversaries</hi> we have; and give us
leave to think their examples ought to have
more force with us, than any other what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.
We pretend not to be wiser than they
were, nor to know what is more expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for <hi>devotion</hi> than they; we are content
to be condemned for <hi>error</hi> with those who
are allowed to be <hi>infallible,</hi> and to want
<hi>devotion,</hi> where we follow the examples of
the most <hi>holy persons</hi> the world ever had.
If the practice of the Primitive <hi>Church</hi> in
this point were not given us for the first
six hundred years and more, it were an
easie matter to evince it by express testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies:
but that is not the thing insisted
on, but that this is a matter of <hi>Discipline,</hi>
and the <hi>Church</hi> hath the power to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
it in one <hi>Age</hi> as well as another.</p>
            <p>§. 4. Which is the next thing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.<note place="margin">The lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Here I shall desire but two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
to resolve this by. 1. That the
<hi>Churches power</hi> is only to <hi>edification</hi> and not
to destruction; for this was as much as the
<hi>Apostles</hi> challenged to themselves,<note place="margin">2 Cor 10. 8</note> and I
hope none dare challenge more: but this
is a principle of natural reason, that no
power in a society ought to be extended
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:45050:119"/>
beyond the benefit of it, or to contradict
the end or design of it. 2. That the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
were the most competent Judges of
what made for the <hi>Edification</hi> of the
Church; and what they declared did tend
to that end, no succeeding persons ought
to condemn as contrary to it. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon that infallible <hi>Spirit</hi> which the
<hi>Apostles</hi> had, and the mighty care in them
of the <hi>Churches</hi> good, which we cannot
think any since them can exceed them in.
These things being supposed, we are only
to consider, whether the <hi>Apostle</hi> hath not
delivered his sense in our present subject,
<hi>viz.</hi> that prayers in an unknown tongue are
contrary to the <hi>Edification</hi> of the <hi>Church?</hi>
It seems somewhat hard to us to be put
to prove a matter so evident from St. <hi>Pauls</hi>
discourse, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. and we could not
imagine, any would go about to reconcile
prayers in an unknown tongue, to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.
but those who think they can reconcile the
worship of <hi>Images</hi> to the second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The abuse St. <hi>Paul</hi> corrects with
so much sharpness in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi>
was an impertinent use of the gift of
<hi>Tongues;</hi> such I mean as did not tend to
the <hi>Edification</hi> of the <hi>Church:</hi> as for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
one man made a long Harangue in
<hi>Hebrew,</hi> and pleased himself mightily in
the sound of the words, when not a person
there, it may be, understood a word that he
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:45050:120"/>
said, another of a sudden begins a Hymn in
<hi>Syriack</hi> or <hi>Chaldee,</hi> another falls a praying in

what these several men said: to what
purpose is all this, saith the Apostle, only
for by-standers,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 20, 23.</note> to think they were <hi>Children</hi>
or <hi>mad men:</hi> could they imagine <hi>God</hi> gave
them these gifts of tongues, to make un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth
and insignificant sounds with, where
the people were met together for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of <hi>God?</hi> If they were so much tickled
with the noise, they might make that at
home,<note place="margin">V. 28.</note> and not in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> where
<hi>all things ought to be done to Edification.</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. 26.</note> For
they met together as a company of reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
men to receive some benefit that
might be common to them all;<note place="margin">V. 2, 3, 4, 5, &amp;c.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the gift of tongues in a society of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
could be of no use without an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter.</hi>
But lest all this should seem to
be spoken only of instruction of the people,
and not of prayer to God, and that the
case were not alike in both these, he adds,
<hi>If I pray in an unknown tongue,</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. 14.</note> 
               <hi>my Spirit
prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.
i. e.</hi> I may exercise my gift, but it is to
no use at all in the <hi>Church.</hi> How so?
<q>One of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> might have
told St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when I see him pray, and
know what he is doing, may I not joyn
my intention of praying with his, as our
Embassadour, and pray my own private
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:45050:120"/>
prayers at the same time that he doth?
I know the substance of what he designs
to pray for; and although I do not
know his meaning, God knows mine:
and therefore I can see no hinderance of
devotion at all in this, that when
one begins a prayer in an unknown
tongue; all the people fall upon their
knees, and pray too:</q> This is the plain
answer they must give St. <hi>Paul</hi> who justifies
prayers in an unknown tongue. But we
are content with St. <hi>Pauls</hi> judgement in
this case, and the reason of it, that the
acts belonging to the worship of God in
the <hi>Church</hi> ought to be of so common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment,
that all may have a share in
them, and receive the benefit by them:
Or else they were far better hold their
peace. It is very impertinent to say, that
the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks only of extraordinary
gifts, and not of the settled and ordinary
devotions of the <hi>Church.</hi> For the case is
the same, where the language is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
whether it be spoken by a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle</hi>
or not: And the <hi>Apostle</hi> layes down
a general rule from this particular case,
<hi>that all things must be done to edifying,</hi> which
it appears he judges the use of an unknown
language not to be. And if after all this,
it be in the <hi>Churches</hi> power to reverse the
<hi>Apostles</hi> decree as to praying in an unknown
language, they may use the very same
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:45050:121"/>
power, as to all other Offices of <hi>Religion,</hi>
and may command preaching to be in a
tongue as unknown as praying; that so the
people may meet together, and pray, and
hear Sermons, and understand never a
word, for their great edification. Unless
among us <hi>God</hi> should put it into their hearts
to speak <hi>English,</hi> whether they would or
no, as was once said by an ignorant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
on the like occasion. If all that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
in the prayers of the people, be
only <hi>an intention to pray,</hi> whatever the
words be, <hi>Abracadabra</hi> might serve to pray
with, as well as <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> and the old
Womans saying of it, <hi>Avi Mari gratia
plinam dams ticum, beneditta tu in mulabs
yeth Benedictus frictus frentris tui, sweet Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
Amen;</hi> was as effectual a prayer if she
meant it so, as could be uttered by the

better than to write so. It is true he saith
(not in the <hi>Preface,</hi> but <hi>Proleg. 13. n. 19.)
that the Syriack Tongue is the Tongue of the
learned among the Christians throughout the
East, as appears by the Liturgies and divine
Offices, which are almost every where per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed

§. 6. 2. I said the sincerity of <hi>devotion</hi>

               <note place="margin">Of their doctrine of the efficacy of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> 
               <hi>This,</hi> he saith, <hi>he had rather look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as a mistake, than a calumny, having
never read any Council wherein this doctrine
is defined, and as to the Sacrament of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
(which he supposeth I chiefly mean)
the Council of</hi> Trent <hi>hath determined it to be
a calumny for any to say, that according to
their doctrine it doth confer grace without the
good motion of the receiver. Madam,</hi> I ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
expected he should have understood
the doctrine of his own party better, or
been more ingenuous in confessing it. For
my quarrel had no particular respect to the
<hi>Sacrament of Pennance,</hi> more than to any
other <hi>Sacrament</hi> of theirs; and if I can
make it appear, that it is their doctrine,
that the efficacy of Sacraments doth not
depend upon the preparation of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver,
but the bare administration, or the
<hi>external work done,</hi> I need not add much
to shew how much this doth obstruct the
<hi>sincerity</hi> of <hi>devotion.</hi> It had been an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
long received in the Schools, although
with different wayes of explication, that
the <hi>Sacraments</hi> of the new <hi>Law</hi> differed
from those of the old in this, that the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy
of those of the old Law in confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
grace, did depend upon what they
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:45050:123"/>
called <hi>opus operantis, i. e.</hi> the <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion</hi>
of the receiver of them; but that
the <hi>Sacraments</hi> of the <hi>new Law</hi> did confer
grace <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> i. e. <hi>by the thing it
self,</hi> without any dependence therein upon
the internal motion or preparation of mind
in him that did partake of them. This
doctrine began to be in a particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
applyed to the <hi>Mass,</hi> because that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<hi>Christ</hi> in a more especial way than
any other <hi>Sacrament,</hi> thence it was believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and asserted, that it did produce saving
effects, as remission of sins and true grace,
although we should suppose an impossible
thing,<note place="margin">Gabr. Biel sup. Canon. Miss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

true Grace; as Baptism takes away origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
sin, and gives grace to the Infant bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
whatever the sins of men are. These
are the expressions of one of their profound
Doctors. And therefore they distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the efficacy of the <hi>work done,</hi> not barely
from the <hi>dignity</hi> of the <hi>Priest,</hi> and the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
of the <hi>receiver,</hi> but from the <hi>devotion</hi>
and <hi>preparation</hi> of mind which the receiver
came with.<note place="margin">Bell. de ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecta Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cram. l. 2. c. 1.</note> Which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himself can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deny, only two things he saith to take
off the <hi>odium</hi> of it. One is, <hi>That they do
not wholly exclude them, but only from the
efficacy of Sacraments; which,</hi> he saith, <hi>is
effectually proved by the case of Infants, that
it doth not depend upon any quality of the
receiver:</hi> the Other, <hi>that though the Mass as
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:45050:124"/>
a Sacrament, may not profit those who are
not duly prepared, yet as a Sacrifice it may.</hi>
By which these things are evident: 1. That
the efficacy of the <hi>Sacraments</hi> in conferring
grace, doth not at all depend upon the
qualification of the receiver. 2. That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
upon other accounts some disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are required in adult persons to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the benefit of them as <hi>Sacraments,</hi> yet
the effect of the <hi>Mass</hi> as a Sacrifice, is not
at all hindered by want of them. If it
were a thing possible, I would willingly
understand what they mean by <hi>Sacraments</hi>
conferring grace <hi>ex opere operato</hi> (which
are not only the express terms of the
<hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi>

For the manner of it is declared by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be unintelligible, and no wonder,
for they suppose <hi>Grace</hi> to be contained in the
<hi>Sacrament</hi> (and it is defined with an <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema</hi>
by the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent)</hi> and by the
<hi>Sacrament</hi> of it self it is conveyed into the
heart of a man;<note place="margin">Can. 6.</note> but whether it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
as in an <hi>univocal cause,</hi> as in an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument,</hi>
or as in a <hi>sign;</hi> Whether it be
conferred by the <hi>Sacraments</hi> as <hi>Physical,</hi> or
as <hi>Moral Causes,</hi> whether by a <hi>power inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi>
in the <hi>Sacraments</hi> themselves; or a
<hi>power assistent</hi> concurring with the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi>
whether it be conveyed as <hi>Physick</hi> in
a <hi>Cup,</hi> or as <hi>Heat</hi> to Water by a <hi>red hot
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:45050:124"/>
Iron,</hi> or as healing to the person who
touched the hemm of our Saviours Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
whether they produce only a next
disposition to grace, or not the grace it
self, but the union of grace with the soul,
or (which is the most common opinion)
that Physical action whereby grace is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
which doth truly, really and physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
depend upon the Sacraments (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereby the external action of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring
them) These are looked on as
great Riddles among them, and so they
ought to be; but these things, say they,
need not be determined, nor the manner
of the thing be understood, no more than
those who were miraculously healed, did
the manner of the cure; a very proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
if the matter of fact were as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in one, as it is the other. But if I
should say, that the wearing a Cap of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
figure would certainly convey wit and
understanding into a man, and the meer
putting it on was enough to produce the
effect: and a person should tell me it was an
unintelligible thing, were it enough think
you, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> doth in this case, to run
to other mysteries of faith and nature which
are as hard as that? By this consequence
no man ought to be charged with believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
absurd and unreasonable things, and
the Trinity and resurrection shall serve to
justifie the <hi>Fables</hi> of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> as well as
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:45050:125"/>
the doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> and the
efficacy of the Sacraments <hi>ex opere operato.</hi>
We could easily dispense with the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
terms and ungrammaticalness of them,
if there were any thing under them, that
were capable of being understood; but
that is not the greatest quarrel I have with
this doctrine; for I say, still notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the tricks and arts which have
been used to palliate it, it doth obstruct
the sincerity of devotion, by making the
exercise of it by the preparation of our
minds for the use of Sacraments to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary.
For if <hi>Grace</hi> be effectually confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the force of the bare external action,
which is acknowledged by them all, what
need can there be of a due preparation of
mind by the exercise of faith, prayer, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> in order to the receiving the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of them? <hi>Yes,</hi> say they, <hi>the internal
disposition of the mind is necessary to remove
impediments, and to make a subject capable
of receiving it: as driness in Wood to make
it burn:</hi> but what do they mean by this
<hi>internal disposition</hi> of mind? the exercise of
the graces and duties I mentioned? by no
means: but that there be no mortal sin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confessed,
that there be no actual opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the <hi>Will</hi> to the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as for
Instance, if a man when he is going to
be baptized, resolves with himself that he
will not be baptized; or while he is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:45050:125"/>
that he will not believe in <hi>Father,
Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> nor renounce the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi>
and all his works. This indeed they
say hinders the <hi>efficacy</hi> of <hi>Sacraments,</hi> but
not the <hi>bare want of devotion;</hi> and if want
of devotion doth not hinder <hi>Grace</hi> being
received, what arguments can men use to
perswade persons to it? Who will undergo
so strict an examination of himself, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to raise his mind to a due prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for the participation of <hi>Sacraments,</hi>
if he knows before hand that he shall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
receive <hi>Grace</hi> by the <hi>Sacraments</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it? And surely they will not say, but
what doth obstruct the exercise of these
things, doth very much hinder devotion.
If men had a mind to banish it out of the
world, they could never do it under a fairer
pretence, than that <hi>Grace,</hi> and consequently
the effects of it may be obtained without
it: and I do not question but this doctrine
hath been one of the great causes of the
corrupt lives of those who believe it?
From hence the trade of saying <hi>Masses</hi> hath
proved so gainful, and such multitudes of
them have been procured for the benefit of
particular persons, this being a much ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier
way of procuring <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi>
than fervent prayer, constant endeavours
after a Holy Life, Mortification, Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness

preparations as unnecessary to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
the benefits of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Part. 3. c. 7. p. 554.</note> and
that the worst persons might come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fear to it. And that the most required
as necessary by them, is only the <hi>Sacrament</hi>
of <hi>Penance</hi> to recover Grace by, which he
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:45050:126"/>
saith, they reduce to <hi>bare confession;</hi> and
that this by them is not made necessary
neither by the more probable opinion, but
only being at that time free from the guilt
of mortal sin. It is not to be denyed that
<hi>Mons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Arnauld</hi> hath proved sufficiently the
other opinion to be most consonant to <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi>
and <hi>Fathers,</hi> and the <hi>rules</hi> of a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
life;</hi> but when that is granted, the
other opinion is yet more agreeable to the
doctrine of the <hi>Roman Church.</hi> For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<hi>Cassander</hi> produce some particular
testimonies against it of persons in that
<hi>Church;</hi> yet we must appeal for the sense
of their Church, to the decrees of the
<hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent;</hi> which are so contrived,
as not to condemn the grossest doctrine of
the <hi>opus operatum.</hi> For when it doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine,
<hi>That whosoever shall say, that the
Sacraments do not confer grace</hi> ex opere
operato <hi>shall be Anathema,</hi> it cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
according to the sense of <hi>Cassan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
and those he mentions, that the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of <hi>Sacraments</hi> doth not depend upon the
<hi>worth of the Priest:</hi> For the twelfth Canon
relates to that, <hi>Whosoever shall say, that the
Minister being in mortal sin, although he
useth all the essentials to a Sacrament, yet
doth not celebrate a Sacrament, let him be
Anathema.</hi> Those reverend <hi>Fathers</hi> were
not sure so prodigal of their <hi>Anathema's,</hi>
to bestow two of them upon the same
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:45050:127"/>
thing: Their meaning then in the <hi>eighth
Canon</hi> must be distinct from the <hi>twelfth,</hi> and
if it be so, the <hi>opus operatum</hi> cannot have
respect to the <hi>worth of the Priest,</hi> but the
<hi>devotion</hi> of the <hi>receiver,</hi> and it is there op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to the faith of the divine promise.
This will appear more plain by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
given of it in the <hi>History</hi> of that
<hi>Council.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of the Council of <hi>Trent, l. 2. p.</hi> 237.</note> 
               <q>After, they treated of condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those, who deny <hi>Sacraments</hi> do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
grace to him that putteth not a barr,
or do not confess, that <hi>Grace</hi> is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Sacraments, and conferred, not
by vertue of faith, but <hi>ex opere operato,</hi>
but coming to expound how it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and their causality, every one
did agree, that grace is gained by all
those actions that excite devotion,
which proceedeth not from the force
of the work it self, but from the vertue
of devotion, which is in the worker,
and these are said in the Schools to cause
grace <hi>ex opere operantis.</hi> There are other
actions which cause grace, not by the
devotion of him that worketh, or him
that receiveth the work, but by vertue
of the work it self; such are the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<hi>Sacraments,</hi> by which grace is receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
so that there be no barr of mortal
sin to exclude it, though there be not
any devotion. So by the work of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
grace is given to the Infant, whose
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:45050:127"/>
mind is not moved towards it, and to
one born a Fool, because there is no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment
of sin. The <hi>Sacrament</hi> of
<hi>Chrisme</hi> doth the like, and that of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
Vnction,</hi> though the sick man hath
lost his memory. But he that hath mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
sin, and doth persevere actually or
habitually, cannot receive grace by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the contrariety, not because the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi>
hath not vertue to produce it <hi>ex
opere operato,</hi> but because the receiver is
not capable, being possessed with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
quality.</q> I dare now appeal to the
most indifferent Judge, Whether what I
objected to them concerning the <hi>efficacy</hi> of
<hi>Sacraments,</hi> whether the minds of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers
of them be prepared or no, were
not so far from being a <hi>calum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y,</hi> that there
is not so much as the least <hi>mistake</hi> in it:
if the doctrine of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> be
embraced by them. And any one who
shall consider their number of <hi>Sacraments,</hi>
and the admirable effects of every one of
them, may very well wonder how any
man among them should want <hi>Grace,</hi>
or have any <hi>Devotion?</hi> For <hi>Grace</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
conferred by the <hi>Sacraments</hi> at so
many convenient seasons of his life,
whether he hath any devotion or no,
he is sure of <hi>Grace,</hi> if he doth but
partake of their <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and need
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:45050:128"/>
need not trouble himself much about <hi>devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
since his work may be done without
it. Never any doctrine was certainly bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
contrived for the satisfaction of <hi>impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
sinners</hi> than theirs is. Our <hi>Saviour</hi>
seems very churlish and severe when he
calls <hi>sinners</hi> to <hi>repentance,</hi> that they may
be saved; but they have found out a
much easier and smoother passage, like
that of a man in a Boat, that may sleep all
the while, and land safe at last. Not so
much as the use of reason is required for
the effect of that blessed <hi>Sacrament</hi> of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
<hi>Vnction,</hi> by which like a <hi>Ship</hi> for a
long Voyage, a person is pitched and calk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for eternity. Surely, it is the hardest
thing that may be, for any one to want
<hi>Grace</hi> among them, if they do but suffer
the <hi>Vse of Sacraments</hi> upon them, and they
are the gentlest givers of it imaginable, for
all they desire of their <hi>Patients</hi> for <hi>Grace,</hi> is
only for them to lye still; but if they
should chance to be unruly, and kick
away the <hi>Priests,</hi> or their rites of <hi>Chrisme,</hi> I
know not then what may become of them.
Yet the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> hath been so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent
in this case,<note place="margin">Rituale Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cram. ext. Unct.</note> that <hi>supposing men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a</hi> delirium, <hi>or wholly insensible, if before
it be but probable they desired it, or gave any
signs of contrition,<note place="margin">Lutet. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris. 1665.</note> it ought not to be omitted;
alwayes provided, that those who are mad
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:45050:128"/>
do nothing against the reverence of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
That being secured, their work is
done; and if any sins have remained up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them; they are taken off by vertue of
this <hi>sacred Vnction;</hi> and being thus anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
like the <hi>Athletae</hi> of old they are prepared
to wrestle with all the powers of the
Air, who can then fasten no hold upon
them. Yet to be just to them, the <hi>Roman
Ritual</hi> saith, <hi>that impenitent persons, and
those who dye in mortal sin and excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
and unbaptized are to be denyed extream
Vnction.</hi> A hard case for those <hi>who dye in
mortal sin!</hi> for if they could but express
any <hi>sign</hi> of <hi>contrition,</hi> by the motion of an
Eye or a <hi>Finger,</hi> all were well enough?
And for the <hi>impenitent,</hi> we are not to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
them so cruel to account any so, but
such who refuse the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Pennance;</hi>
the summ of it then is, if a man when he is
like to live, and therefore to sin no longer,
doth but probably express some <hi>signs</hi> of
<hi>contrition,</hi> and doth not refuse the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of <hi>Pennance,</hi> if time and the condition
of the <hi>Patient</hi> permit the using it, then he
is to have grace conferred on him by this
last <hi>Sacrament</hi> which he is sure to receive,
although he be no more sensible what
they are doing about him, than if he were
dead already. So that upon the whole
matter, I begin to wonder how any sort
of men in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> can be
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:45050:129"/>
afraid of falling so low as <hi>Purgatory:</hi> I had
thought so much <hi>Grace</hi> as is given them by
every Sacrament (where there are so many,
and some of them so often used) might
have served to carry one to Heaven; they
receive a stock of <hi>Grace</hi> in <hi>Baptism,</hi> before
they could think of it; if they lose any in
Childhood, that is supplyed again by the
<hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Chrisme</hi> or <hi>Confirmation;</hi> if
they fall into actual sins, and so lose it, it is
but <hi>confessing</hi> to the <hi>Priest</hi> and receiving <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,</hi>
and they are set up again with a
new stock: and it is a hard case, if that be
not increased by frequent <hi>Masses,</hi> at every
one of which he receives more; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<hi>Priests</hi> want the comfortable Grace
that is to be received by the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of
<hi>Matrimony,</hi> yet they may easily make it up
by the number of <hi>Masses:</hi> and to make all
sure at last, the extream <hi>Vnction</hi> very
sweetly conveyes <hi>Grace</hi> into them whether
they be sensible or not. But all this while,
what becomes of <hi>Purgatory?</hi> That is like
to be left very desolate; if the interest of
that opinion were not greater, than the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
for the <hi>Sacraments</hi> conferring grace
<hi>ex opere operato.</hi> Let them seek to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
them if they can, it is sufficient for our
purpose, that both of them tend to destroy
the sincerity of devotion, and the necessity
of a good life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 8. 3. I said the sincerity of devotion
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:45050:129"/>
is much obstructed by discouraging tdiscourahe</hi>
reading <hi>of the</hi> Scriptures,<note place="margin">Of their discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the reading the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</note> 
               <hi>which is our most
certain Rule of faith and life. To this
he answers two wayes:</hi> 1. That their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
prudential dispensing the reading the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
to persons whom she judges fit and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for it, and not to such whom she judges in a
condition to receive or do harm by it, is no
discouraging the reading of them; any more
than a Father may be said to discourage his
Child, because he will not put a Knife or a
Sword into his hands, when he foresees he
will do mischief with it to himself or others;
and the Scriptures, <hi>he saith,</hi> are no other in
the hands of one who doth not submit his
judgement in the interpretation of it to that
of the Church; the doing of which he makes
the character of a meek and humble soul,
and the contrary of an arrogant and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous
spirit. 2. That the ill conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of permitting the promiscuous read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Scripture were complained of by <hi>Henry</hi>
the eighth, who was the first that gave way
to it; and if his judgement ought not to be
followed in after times, let the dire effects of
so many Sects and Fanaticisms as have risen
in <hi>England</hi> from the reading of it, bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
For all Heresies arise, saith St. <hi>Austin,</hi>
from misunderstanding the Scriptures; and
therefore the Scripture being left as among
Protestants to the private interpretation of
every fanciful Spirit, cannot be a most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:45050:130"/>
rule of faith and life. <hi>In which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
are three things to be discussed:
1. Whether that prudential dispensing the</hi>
Scriptures <hi>as he calls it, be any hinderance
to devotion or no? 2. Whether the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the</hi> Scriptures <hi>be the cause of the
numbers of</hi> Sects <hi>and</hi> Fanaticisms <hi>which
have been in</hi> England? 3. <hi>Whether our
opinion concerning the reading and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting</hi>
Scripture, <hi>doth hinder it from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a most certain rule of faith and life?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Whether that prudential dispensing
the <hi>Scriptures</hi> used in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi>
doth hinder <hi>devotion</hi> or no? This <hi>prudential
dispensing</hi> I suppose he means, the allowing
no persons to read the <hi>Scriptures</hi> in their
own tongue, without licence under the
hand of the <hi>Bishop</hi> or <hi>Inquisitor,</hi> by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Priest or Confessor concerning
the persons fitness for it; and whosoever
presumes to do otherwise, is to be denyed
<hi>absolution.</hi> For this is the express Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
in the fourth Rule of the <hi>Index</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
by order of the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> and
set forth by the authority of <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth,
and since by <hi>Clement</hi> the eighth,<note place="margin">Index li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bror. prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit. Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and. 7.</note> and now
lately inlarged by <hi>Alexander</hi> the seventh.
And whether this tends to the promoting
or discouraging the sincerity of devotion
will appear,<note place="margin">Romae. A. D 1665.</note> by considering these things.
1. That it is agreed on both sides, that the
<hi>Scriptures</hi> do contain in them the unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:45050:130"/>
Will of that <hi>God</hi> whom we are
bound to serve. And it being the end of
<hi>devotion</hi> (as it ought to be of our lives)
to serve him; what is there the mind of
any one who sincerely desires to do it, can
be more inquisitive after, or satisfied in,
than the rules <hi>God</hi> himself hath given for
his own service? Because it is so easie a
matter for men to mistake in the wayes
they choose to serve him in; I see the
world divided more scarce about any thing
than this. Some think <hi>God</hi> ought to be
worshipped by offering up Sacrifices to him
of those things we receive from his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
Others, that we ought to offer up
none to him now, but our selves in a holy
life and actions. Some, that <hi>God</hi> is pleased
by abstaining from flesh or any living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and others, that he is much better
pleased with eating <hi>Fish</hi> than <hi>Flesh,</hi> and that
a full meal of one is at some times mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
and fasting; and eating tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
of the other, is luxury and irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
Some think, no sight more pleasing
to <hi>God,</hi> than to see men lash and whip
themselves for their sins, till the blood
comes; others that he is as well pleased
at least, with hearty repentance, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
obedience without this. Some, that
frequent crossing themselves, going in Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage
to the <hi>Images</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> baptizing
Bells, being sprinckled with holy water,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:45050:131"/>
and buried in a <hi>Monks</hi> habit, are great acts
of devotion; and others, that they are su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
fooleries. Some think that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
they make confession of their sins to a
<hi>Priest,</hi> they cannot be pardoned; others,
that sincere confession to God, is sufficient,
and the other never necessary to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of sin, though it may be sometimes
useful to the ease of the sinner. Some,
that they honour <hi>God</hi> by setting up Images
of him, and worshipping them for his
sake, by addressing themselves to Saints
and Angels to be Intercessors with him; and
others, that they cannot dishonour <hi>God</hi>
more, than by these things. Some, that
they may pray for what they do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
as well as what they do; others,
that since men expect to be answered in
their prayers, they ought to understand
what they say in them. Since these and
other disputes are in the world, not bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
between <hi>Christians</hi> and those of other
<hi>Religions,</hi> but among <hi>Christians</hi> themselves,
what course should a person take, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
to be satisfied? For he finds the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
parties divided about them. Can
any man imagine a better way, if it could
be hoped for, than that <hi>God</hi> himself should
interpose, and declare his own mind ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to what way they ought to serve
him? And this is acknowledged to be done
already by all <hi>Christians</hi> in the <hi>Scriptures;</hi>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:45050:131"/>
and after all this, must not all persons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
be allowed to enquire into that
which is owned to be the will of God? Or
do they think that ordinary people, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
not <hi>Latin</hi> or <hi>Greek,</hi> ought not to
be concerned what becomes of their souls?
If they be and do in good earnest desire to
know how to please <hi>God,</hi> and to serve him;
what directions will they give him? If they
tell him, <hi>they must do as they are bidden;</hi> true,
say they, if we were to worship you for <hi>Gods,</hi>
we would do as you bid us, for we think
it fitting to serve <hi>God</hi> in his own way. But
we would know, whether that <hi>God</hi> whom
we serve, hath given us any <hi>rules</hi> for his
worship or no? <hi>Yes,</hi> say the Priests of the
<hi>Roman Church, he hath done so, but it is
not fit for you to see them.</hi> To what end,
say the people then, were they given, if
they may not be seen? How shall we know
whether we keep them or no, or will you
take upon you the guilt of our sins in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying
his Will, since you will not let us
know what it is? This seems to be a very
just and reasonable request, and I fear it
will one day fall heavy upon those, who
conceal that which they confess to be the
<hi>Will</hi> of <hi>God</hi> from the knowledge of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
And it hath been ingenuously ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by some in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi>
that the people would never be kept to
that way of <hi>devotion</hi> they are in there, if
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:45050:132"/>
they were suffered to read the <hi>Scriptures;</hi>
but the more shame the mean time for those
who impose such things upon them under
a pretence of devotion which are so repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the Will of God. But the same
reason which hath made them leave out
the <hi>second Commandment</hi> in their offices of
devotion, hath brought them to so severe a
prohibition of reading the <hi>Scriptures</hi> in a
known language, but where themselves are
already so secure of the persons that
they dare to give way to it: and that is,
lest their consciences should start and
boggle at the breaking a command of
<hi>God,</hi> when they pretended to serve him.</p>
            <p>§. 9. 2. That no objection can be now
made against the peoples reading the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments against reading the Scriptures would have held a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the publishing them in a language known to the People.</note>
but would have held against the
publishing them in a language to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by the people. For were the people
less ignorant and heady, less presumptuous
and opinionative then, than they are now?
Was not there the same danger of mistak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their sense at that time? Was not the
people of <hi>Israel</hi> as refractory and disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
as any have been since? Were they not
as apt to quarrel with divine <hi>Laws</hi> and the
authority <hi>God</hi> had set up among them?
Did not they fall into Sects and divers opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
by misunderstanding the <hi>Law?</hi> yet
were these reasons then thought sufficient
for <hi>God</hi> not to make known his <hi>Law</hi>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:45050:132"/>
to all the people; but to commit it only to
<hi>Aaron</hi> and the <hi>Priests</hi> for them prudentially
to dispense it to them? No; so far from
it, that strict care was taken to make the
people understand it, particular commands
given for this very end, and the Law on
purpose declared to be easie and <hi>intelligible,</hi>
that they might not make its obscurity a
pretence for their Ignorance. Was not
this <hi>Law</hi> given them as a <hi>rule</hi> to direct
themselves by? Were not all sent to this
to learn to govern their actions?<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
shall a young man cleanse his wayes,
by taking heed thereto according to thy word.</hi>
Is not this <hi>Law</hi> said to <hi>convert the soul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 19. 7.</note> 
               <hi>and
to make wise the simple?</hi> and was that
done by <hi>not understanding</hi> it? Was it not
the delight, exercise, and continual Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of those who were truly devout
among them? But how comes our case to
be so much worse under <hi>Christianity?</hi> Is
the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> so much more difficult
and obscure than the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses?</hi> Is
not his <hi>Sermon</hi> on the <hi>Mount,</hi> wherein he
delivers the rules of a <hi>Christian Life,</hi> as
plain as any Chapter in <hi>Leviticus?</hi> What
doth the <hi>Gospel</hi> teach men, but to be and to
do good, to love all men, and to love
<hi>God</hi> above all, to believe in Christ and to
obey his commands, to repent of sins past
and to live no longer in them, and in short,
so to live in this world as they hope to live
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:45050:133"/>
with <hi>God</hi> in happiness hereafter? And are
these things so hard to be understood, that
the people ought not to be made acquainted
with them in their own language? Or is
there any danger they should know them
too well? Was ever the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> more
perverted by false interpretations than in
our <hi>Saviours</hi> time <hi>by</hi> the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees?</hi>
Why doth not he then take some
other care for his own <hi>Law</hi> to prevent this
for the future, if that had been judged by
him the proper way of cure? But thereby
we see the mistakes of the people are ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their Teachers, and there can be no
means to prevent errours in the people but
by stopping them at the fountain heads
from whence they run down among them.
For the common people might have had
a better notion of <hi>Religion,</hi> if their minds
had not been corrupted by the traditions
and <hi>Glosses</hi> of the <hi>Pharisees.</hi> Therefore
methinks they have not gone the wisest
way to work in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of this <hi>prudential dispensing the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi>
their only way had been to have
destroyed them, as <hi>Dioclesian</hi> their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour
in this kind of <hi>prudence</hi> once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed.
For let them assure themselves,
they who understand <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> are
the persons they have ten times more cause
to fear than the common people. And
considering the advantage they once had
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:45050:133"/>
by the horrible <hi>Ignorance</hi> of <hi>Priests</hi> and
people, it must be imputed only to the
watchful eye of Divine Providence, that
the <hi>Scriptures</hi> (being of so little use in
the <hi>Roman Church)</hi> have been preserved
entire to our dayes. There had been no
such means in the world to have prevented
a <hi>Reformation</hi> as this; for they are not out
when they take the <hi>Scripture</hi> so much for
their enemy, as appears by the force and
restraint they put upon it, and the fear and
jealousie they are in about it continually.
If it had not been for this, would any one
have compared the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> in the hands of
the common people as my Adversary doth,
<hi>to a Sword in a mad mans hand?</hi> Is it of so
destructive a Nature, and framed for no
other use than a sword is? which nothing
but discretion keeps a man from doing
mischief by; and all the way a man hath
(though never so meek and humble) to
defend himself by it, is by destroying his
enemy with it, if he continues his assault.
These expressions do not argue any kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to the <hi>Scripture,</hi> nor an apprehension of
any great good comes to the world by it;
but that really men might have been more at
ease and fewer differences in Religion had
happened, if all the Copies of the <hi>Bible</hi>
had been lost assoon as the <hi>Pope</hi> had placed
himself in his infallible <hi>Chair.</hi> This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
was once attempted, as I shall shew af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:45050:134"/>
but failed of success: and I
know not how far the principles of this
<hi>prudence</hi> may carry them, if ever such a
season should fall into their hands again;
having found so much trouble to them
from the <hi>Scriptures</hi> and so little benefit by
them, their <hi>Church</hi> being once owned as
<hi>infallible.</hi> For I would fain know whether
the <hi>Scripture</hi> hath not done more mischief
according to them in the hands of the
<hi>Reformers,</hi> than it can be supposed to do in
the hands of the <hi>common people.</hi> If it must
be <hi>a sword in a mad mans hand,</hi> whether
the more strength and cunning such a one
hath, he be not capable of doing so much
the more mischief by it? And if it were
possible to get it out of such a mans hands,
whether it were not the highest <hi>prudence,</hi>
and care of the publick safety to do it?
It can be then nothing but the impossibility
of the thing, which makes them suffer the
<hi>Scripture</hi> to be in the hands of any who
are capable of doing mischief by it; and
the more mischief they may do, the more
desirable and <hi>prudential</hi> it is to take it from
them. But all men see none are so capable
of doing mischief thereby, as men of the
greatest wit and learning, and that have the
fairest appearance of piety to the world:
the consequence then of this doctrine is,
if pursued to the true design of it, that
the <hi>Scripture</hi> should be kept if possible out
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:45050:134"/>
of the hands of the most subtle, learned
and pious men above all others, if they be
not true to the interests of the <hi>Roman
Church?</hi> It is but a meer shew to pretend
only to keep the people in order, (for
when are they otherwise but when
cunning men have the managing of
them?) the true meaning of this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
is, that it will never be well with the
World till the Books of <hi>Scripture</hi> are all
burnt which are abroad, and that only one
<hi>Original</hi> be preserved in the <hi>Vatican</hi> to
justifie the <hi>Popes</hi> title to <hi>Infallibility,</hi> and
that (as the <hi>Sybilline Oracles</hi> of old,) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to be consulted but in cases of great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity,
and that under the inspection of
some very trusty officers, nor to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
but by the <hi>Pope</hi> himself. If I were
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and owned the
principles of it, I must needs have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
the great men of it in former
times for want of <hi>Prudence</hi> in this matter;
That would have served their turn much
better than forging so many <hi>decretal Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi>
falsifying so many <hi>testimonies,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
so many <hi>Texts</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the dignity of the <hi>Papal Chair.</hi> There
was only one small circumstance wanting,
(their good will we have no cause to
question) and that was the possibility of
it; for although the <hi>Roman Church</hi> called
it self <hi>Catholick,</hi> they were wise enough
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:45050:135"/>
to know, there were many considerable
<hi>Churches</hi> in the world besides theirs, where
the <hi>Scriptures</hi> were preserved, and from
whence copies might be procured by persons
who would be so much the more inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
the more they were forbidden to get
it. Therefore they pitched upon an easier
way, and finding the people under a very
competent degree of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged
them and soothed them up in it,
and told them they could never miss the
way to Heaven, though never so narrow,
in the dark. Their only danger was too
much light, for then probably they might
be in a great dispute, whether the <hi>broad
way</hi> was not the true; for there they saw
most of their <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Leaders.</hi> And
while they kept the people in this profound
Ignorance and superstition, they jogged
on in their opinion, as securely to Heaven,
as <hi>Ignatius Loyola's</hi> Mule did to <hi>Mount-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Orlandin. hist. Societ. Iesu l. 1. n. 17.</note>
when he laid his Bridle on his neck,
to see whether he would take the way to
pursue the <hi>Moor,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Maffeius vit. Ignat. l. 1. c. 3.</note> which was the more
beaten track, or the more craggy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trodden
way to that place of <hi>devotion,</hi> and
by a mighty providence, (and I suppose a
little help of the Rider) the Beast took
the more narrow way. But when persons
began to be awakened by learning, and
thereby grew inquisitive in all matters and
so by degrees in those of Religion, they then
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:45050:135"/>
espied their errour in letting such a Book
lye abroad in so many hands, from whence
so many irresistible arguments were drawn
against the Doctrine and practices of the
<hi>Roman Church.</hi> This I assure my self, is
the true ground of the quarrels against
the Reading the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> but that being
now irremediable, they betake themselves
to smaller arts, and endeavour to hinder
any one particular person whom they have
the least suspicion of, from meddling with a
Book so dangerous to their <hi>Church</hi> and
<hi>Religion.</hi>

them to be more jealous of the <hi>use</hi> of the
<hi>Scriptures,</hi> than ever the Christians were in
former Ages? Was there not much more
danger of misunderstanding the Doctrine
of the Gospel at first than ever after? Nay
were there not very many who were false
<hi>Apostles</hi> and great and dangerous Hereticks,
presumptuous and arrogant, if ever any
were? But did <hi>Christ</hi> or his <hi>Apostles</hi> for all
this, think it unfit to communicate the
doctrine of the <hi>Gospel</hi> to the people; or
were the Books containing it written in
Languages not to be understood by them?
no, they chose the most popular languages of
that time, most largely spread and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
understood. The <hi>Apostles</hi> never told
their Disciples of the danger of reading
the Divine Writings that were among
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:45050:136"/>
them, when they were first spread
abroad; and never so proper a season to
give them caution as then. But instead of
that,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 19.</note> they advise them <hi>to take heed to the sure
word of Prophecy,</hi> and that they did well
therein,<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 4.</note> that <hi>the Scriptures were written for
their instruction and comfort,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. 15, 16.</note> that <hi>being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely
inspired they were able to make them
wise unto salvation.</hi> What, did the <hi>Apostles</hi>
never imagine all this while the ill use that
might be made of them by men of perverse
minds? yes, they knew it as well as any,
and did foretell <hi>Schismes</hi> and <hi>Heresies</hi> that
should be in the <hi>Church,</hi> and saw them in
their own dayes; and yet poor men, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that <hi>exquisite prudence of the Roman
Church,</hi> to prevent them, by so happy an
expedient as when they had written <hi>Epistles</hi>
to several <hi>Churches,</hi> to forbid the promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
reading of them. But it may be, it
was the awe of the <hi>Apostles</hi> and their infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
<hi>Spirit</hi> in interpreting <hi>Scripture,</hi> made
this prohibition not so necessary in their
own time; did the <hi>Church</hi> then find it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to restrain the people after their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease?
We have an occasion soon after giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,
wherein to see the opinion of the
<hi>Church</hi> at that time; the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Corinth</hi>
fell into a grievous Schisme and opposition
to their spiritual Governours: upon this
<hi>Clemens</hi> writes his Epistle to them, wherein
he is so far from forbidding the use of <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:45050:136"/>
to them to preserve unity, that he
bidds them <hi>look diligently into the Scriptures,<note place="margin">Clement. Epistol. ad Corinth. p. 58.</note>
which are the true Oracles of the Holy Ghost:</hi>
and afterwards, <hi>take St.</hi> Pauls <hi>Epistle into
your hands,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 61.</note> 
               <hi>and consider what he saith and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
them very much for being skilled in the
Scriptures:</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 68.</note> 
               <hi>Beloved,</hi> saith he, <hi>ye have known,
and very well known the holy Scriptures, and
ye have throughly looked into the Oracles of
God, therefore call them to mind.</hi> Which
language is as far different from that of the
<hi>Roman Church,</hi> as the Church of that <hi>Age</hi>
is from theirs. Nay the counterfeit <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi>
(whom they can make use of upon
other occasions) is as express in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as the true. For he perswades private
Christians <hi>to continual meditation in the
Scriptures,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Constit. Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. l. 1. c. 4.</note> which he calls <hi>the Oracles of
Christ; and that this is the best imployment
of their retirements.</hi> But we need not use
his testimony in this matter, nor the old
Edition of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> wherein Parents are
bid <hi>to instruct their Children in the Holy
Scriptures,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ignat. ep. ad Philadelph.</note> nor that saying of <hi>Polycarp</hi> to
the <hi>Philippians</hi> out of the old <hi>Latin Edition,
I am confident you are well studied in the
Scriptures;</hi> for in the <hi>Greek</hi> yet preserved,
he exhorts them <hi>to the reading of St.</hi> Pauls
<hi>Epistles that they might be built up in the
faith.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Polycarp. Ep. ad Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipp. p. 16. ed. Usser.</note> So little did these holy men dream
of such a <hi>prudent dispensing the Scriptures</hi>
among them, for fear of mischief they
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:45050:137"/>
might do themselves or others by them.
<hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> mentions <hi>the reading
the Scriptures among Christians before their
Meales,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Clem. Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andr. Strom. 7. p. 728.</note> 
               <hi>and Psalmes and Hymns at them;

               <hi>Origen</hi> in the <hi>Greek Commentaries</hi> lately
published, perswades Christians <hi>by all means,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Comment. in Matthaeum. p. 320.</note>
               <hi>by attending to Reading, Prayer, Teaching,
Meditation therein day and night, to lay up
in their hearts not only the new Oracles of
the Gospell, Apostles and Apocalypse, but the
old ones too of the Law and the Prophets.</hi>
And elsewhere tells his hearers,<note place="margin">Comment. in Ios. p. 27.</note> 
               <hi>they ought
not to be discouraged if they met with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
in reading the Scriptures: for there
was great benefit to be had by them.</hi> But
lest it should be thought he speaks here
only of publick reading the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> in
his Homilies on <hi>Leviticus</hi> he speaks plainly,
<hi>that he would not only have them hear
the Word of God in publick,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Homil. in Levit. 9.</note> 
               <hi>but to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
and meditate therein in their houses
night and day; For Christ is every where
present, and therefore they are commanded
in the Law, to meditate therein upon their
journeys, and when they sit in their houses,
and when they lye down and rise up.</hi> But
had not the <hi>Church</hi> yet experience enough
of the mischief of permitting the <hi>Scriptures</hi>
to the people? Were there ever greater
and more notorious heresies than in those
first ages of the <hi>Church,</hi> and those arising
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:45050:137"/>
from perverting the words and designes of
the <hi>Scriptures?</hi> But did the <hi>Church</hi> yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
grow wiser in the sense of the
<hi>Roman Church?</hi> In the time of the four
<hi>General Councils</hi> they had tryal enough of
the mischief of <hi>Heresies,</hi> but did the <hi>Fathers</hi>
of the <hi>Church</hi> forbid the reading the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi>
on that account? No, but instead of
that they commend the Scriptures to all,
<hi>as the best remedy for all passions of the mind,</hi>
so St. <hi>Basil,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Basil. in Psal. 1. Hieron. pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fat. com. in ep. ad Ephes.</note> and St. <hi>Hierome</hi> call it, and this
latter commends nothing more to the
Women he instructed in devotion, <hi>than
constant reading the Scriptures;</hi> and withall
they say <hi>that infinite evils do arise from ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of the Scriptures;</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Chrys. prefat. in Epist. ad Rom.</note> 
               <hi>from hence most
part of Heresies have come, from hence a neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
and careless life; and unfruitful la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</hi>
Nay so frequent, so earnest and
vehement is St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> in this matter
of recommending the reading of <hi>Scriptures,</hi>
that those of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> have no
other way to answer him, but by saying
<hi>he speaks hyperbolically;</hi> which in plain
<hi>English</hi> is, he speaks too much of it. But
how far different were the opinions of the
wise men of the <hi>Church</hi> in those times,
from what those have thought who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the <hi>interest</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church</hi>
best? We may see what the opinion of the
latter is, by the counsel given to <hi>Iulius</hi> 3.
by the <hi>Bishops</hi> met at <hi>Bononia</hi> for that end,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:45050:138"/>
to give the best advice they could for
restoring the dignity of the <hi>Roman See,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Consil. de stabiliendâ Rom. sede. p. 6.</note>
               <hi>that which was the greatest and weightiest
of all,</hi> they said, <hi>they reserved to the last,
which was that by all means as little of
the Gospel as might be especially in the
vulgar tongue, be read in the Cities under
his jurisdiction; and that little which was
in the Mass ought to be sufficient; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
should it be permitted to any mortal
to read more. For as long as men were
contented with that little, all things went
well with them, but quite otherwise since
more was commonly read. For this, in
short, is that Book,</hi> say they, <hi>which above
all others hath raised those Tempests and
Whirlewinds, which we are almost carryed
away with: And in truth, if any one dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
considers it, and compares it with
what is done in our Churches, will find
them very contrary to each other; and our
very doctrine not only to be different from it
but repugnant to it.</hi> A very fair and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuos
confession! and if self-condemned
persons be Hereticks, there can be none
greater than those of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi>
especially the <hi>prudential men</hi> in it, such
as these certainly were, whom the <hi>Pope</hi>
singled out to give advice in these matters.
But how different is the wisdom of the
<hi>Children of this world</hi> from that of the
<hi>Children of Light!</hi> We have already seen
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:45050:138"/>
what another kind of judgement the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Fathers had of the usefulness of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
to the people, than they have in the
<hi>Roman Church:</hi> but we need not more
to prove it, since it is acknowledged by
those who are against the reading the
Scriptures by the people, that it was
otherwise in the <hi>Primitive Church;</hi> so
<hi>Alphonsus à Castro</hi> and <hi>Sixtus Senensis</hi>

precept, Colos. 3. <hi>let the word of God

abundantly. The sum of this argument
is, that the reasons now urged against the
peoples Reading the <hi>Scriptures</hi> would
have held against the publishing of
them in a language to be understood
by the people; that they saw the same
inconveniencies which are objected now,
and yet commended the reading the
<hi>Scriptures</hi> to all, that in all the primitive
<hi>Church,</hi> the practice was not only retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but vehemently urged, after all the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies
which had risen in the <hi>Church</hi> in

               <p>The unreasonableness of objecting Sects and
Fanaticisms to us as the effects of reading
the Scriptures. Fanaticism countenanced

of doctrine, proved from their own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.
Of the Revelations pleaded for the

S. <hi>Catharines</hi> wonderful faculty of smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
souls, a gift peculiar to her and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip
Nerius.</hi> The vain attempts of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling
those Revelations. The great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of female Revelations approved in the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church. Purgatory, Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,
Auricular Confession proved by
Visions and Revelations. Festivals ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:45050:140"/>
upon the credit of Revelations:
the Feast of <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> on the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
made to <hi>Juliana,</hi> the Story of it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
from their own Writers: No such
things can be objected to our Church. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations
still owned by them; proved from
the Fanatick Revelations of Mother <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi>
very lately published by <hi>Mr. Cressy:</hi>
Some instances of the blasphemous Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense
contained in them. The Monastick
Orders founded in Enthusiasm. An ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the great Fanaticism of S. <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,</hi>
and S. <hi>Romoaldus:</hi> their hatred
of Humane Learning, and strange Visions
and Revelations. The Carthusian Order
founded upon a Vision. The Carmelites
Vision of their habit. The Franciscan and
Dominican Orders founded on Fanaticism,
and seen in a Vision of <hi>Innocent</hi> the third
to be the great supporters of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church. The <hi>Quakerism</hi> of S. <hi>Francis</hi>
described from their best Authors. His Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
Extasies and Fanatick Preaching.
The Vision of <hi>Dominicus.</hi> The blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Enthusiasm of the Mendicant Fryers.
The History of it related at large. Of the
<hi>Evangelium aeternum,</hi> and the blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
contained in it. The Author of it
supposed to be the General of the Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciscan
Order, however owned by the Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and read and preached at <hi>Paris.</hi> The
opposition to it by the Vniversity: but fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured

The <hi>Popes</hi> horrible partiality to the Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.

            </argument>
            <p>§. 1. 2. WE come to consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the reading the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi>
be the cause of all the <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticisms</hi>

               <note place="margin">The unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of objecting Sects and Fanaticism to us, as the effect of reading the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</note>
He might much better have charged the
<hi>Philosophers,</hi> especially <hi>Aristotle,</hi> with all
the disputes in the world; for they not
only by their writings have occasioned ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
but have taught men the pernicious
use of reasoning, without which, the world
might be as quiet as a <hi>Flock</hi> of <hi>Sheep.</hi> If
they could but perswade men to lay aside
that mischievous faculty, I dare undertake
for them, that let the people have the
<hi>Bible</hi> never so much among them; they
shall never hurt the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> Do
they not tell us, that the words of <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi>
are plain for <hi>Transubstantiation, This
is my body,</hi> Why do not then the people
as readily believe that, as any other propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition?
By which we see, it is not meerly
reading, but a more dangerous thing, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>considering</hi> or <hi>reasoning</hi> which make
them embrace some things as they lye in
words, and interpret others according to
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:45050:142"/>
the clearest evidence, which the nature of
the thing, the comparing with other
places, and the common sense of mankind
will give. <hi>But why are we not all of a mind?</hi>
I would fain know the time when men
were so. This variety of <hi>Sects</hi> was obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
against the <hi>Philosophers,</hi> and thought
no argument then; it was objected against
the <hi>primitive Christians,</hi> and thought of no
force then; why must it signifie more in
<hi>England,</hi> than ever it did in any other age
or place? But say they, <hi>It was otherwise in</hi>
England <hi>before the Scriptures came to be
read by all, it was and is otherwise in all
Churches where they are not read, therefore
these Sects and Fanaticisms are the dire ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of the promiscuous reading the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</hi>
This is the common and popular
argument. <hi>All things were well with us
when we offered up Cakes to the Queen of
Heaven; when all joyned in the communion
of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, then there were no Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticisms,
nor New Lights, no Sects, as there
are now in</hi> England; <hi>therefore why should
any one make any doubt, but he ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the Church of</hi> Rome? This necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
leads me into the examination of these
two things. 1. Whether there be no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of <hi>Fanaticism</hi> in the <hi>Roman Church?</hi>
2. Whether the <hi>Vnity</hi> of <hi>that Church</hi> be
so admirable to tempt all persons, who
prize the <hi>Churches Vnity,</hi> to return to it?</p>

               <note place="margin">Fanaticism counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</note> By <hi>Fanaticism</hi>
we understand either an <hi>Enthusiastick way

appear, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is so far
from being cleared from it, that it hath
given great encouragement to it.</p>
            <p>1. As to an <hi>Enthusiastick</hi> way of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
I shall now prove, that there have not
been greater <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> among us in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
than have been in the <hi>Roman Church;</hi>
all the difference is, they have been some
alwayes, others for a time, allowed and
countenanced and encouraged by those
of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> but among us they
have been decryed and opposed by all the
members of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> I
shall not insist upon the resolution of faith,
and the infallibility of the <hi>Church,</hi> which
must be carried to <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> at last; but
I shall prove it by plain <hi>revelations</hi> which
have been made the grounds among them
of believing some doctrines in dispute, and
the reasons of setting up a more <hi>perfect

insisted upon was, <hi>some private revelations
made to some Saints about the immaculate
conception,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 3. Tract. 11. Sect. 1. n. 3.</note> 
               <hi>which being once received in the
Church, adds no small strength,</hi> he saith, <hi>to
any doctrine, and gives a solid foundation
for a definition: i. e.</hi> that the matter may
be defined to be of faith, and necessary to
be believed by all Christians. Upon this
he reckons up several <hi>revelations</hi> publickly
received in the <hi>Church,</hi> one, mentioned by
<hi>Anselm,</hi> being <hi>a divine apparition to an
Abbot in a storm</hi> (a fit time for apparitions)
<hi>whereby he was admonished to keep the Feast
of the Conception of the blessed Virgin,</hi> upon
which,<note place="margin">Baron. not. in Martyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log. Rom. 8. Decemb.</note> as <hi>Baronius</hi> observes, <hi>that Feast was
first kept in England.</hi> Which revelation
<hi>Wadding</hi> tells us, <hi>is publickly recited in the
office for the day, and was not only extant in
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:45050:143"/>
several Breviaries of</hi> England, France, Spain
<hi>and</hi> Italy; <hi>but he had divers himself autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized
by the Pope, wherein it was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
as true and piously to be believed, and
accordingly have been publickly sung and used
in the Church about an hundred years. And
what,</hi> saith he, <hi>is the consequence of disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
this, but to say in effect, that the Pope
and the</hi> Roman <hi>Church are easily cheated and
abused by impostures, and forgers of false re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations
to institute new Festival Solemnities
upon the credit of them?</hi> Another revelation
was made to <hi>Norbertus</hi> the founder of the
Order of the <hi>Praemonstratenses,</hi> in which,
<hi>the Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>appeared and commended her
veneration to him, and gave him a white gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in token of her Original Innocency;</hi>
which revelation is believed by all of that
Order, and taken as the reason of their
habit. Besides these, <hi>there are several other
revelations to S.</hi> Gertrude, <hi>and others to the
same purpose reckoned up by several Catholick
Authors, which no man ought to reject, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he intends to be as great a Heretick</hi> (or
therein as wise a man) <hi>as</hi> Erasmus <hi>was.
Nay, these revelations were so frequent,</hi> he
saith, <hi>that there hath been no age since the
tenth Century, wherein there hath not been
some made to devout men or women about this
matter.</hi> But above all these, most remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
were those to S. <hi>Brigitt, who had not
one or two, but many to this purpose; and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:45050:144"/>
the latest were of</hi> Joanna a Cruce, <hi>which,</hi> it
seems, <hi>were at first eagerly opposed, but at
last came out with the approbation of two
Cardinals and several Bishops of the Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in</hi> Spain. But now who could imagine
a thing so often revealed, so publickly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
so many times attested from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
should not be generally received?
but the mischief of it was, the contrary
doctrine had revelations for it too. For
<hi>Antoninus</hi> and <hi>Cajetan</hi> say, <hi>S. Catharine</hi> of
<hi>Siena</hi> had it revealed to her, that she was
conceived with Original sin. What is to
be done now? Here we have Saint against
Saint, Revelation against Revelation, <hi>S. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine</hi>
against <hi>S. Brigitt,</hi> and all the rest of
them. Here to speak truth, they are
somewhat hard put to it; for they grant
<hi>God</hi> cannot contradict himself, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of one these must be false, but which of
them is all the question. Here they exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
which of these doctrines is most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant
to <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Tradition,</hi> which is
most for the benefit of the <hi>Church,</hi> which
were persons of the greater <hi>sanctity,</hi> and
whose <hi>revelations</hi> were the most approved.
For. <hi>S. Brigitts</hi> they plead stoutly, that when
they were delivered by her to her Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
they were strictly examined, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them by the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Divines</hi> of
<hi>Sweden,</hi> and approved as <hi>divine revelations;</hi>
from them they were sent as such to the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:45050:144"/>
               <hi>Council of Basil;</hi> from thence they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
over again at <hi>Naples,</hi> and there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
and preached in the presence and
by command of the <hi>Queen</hi> and <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop</hi>
before all the people of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
again examined at <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Prelats</hi>
and <hi>Cardinals, A. D.</hi> 1377. by the Popes
appointment, and there approved: and
<hi>A. D.</hi> 1379. they are declared by those
<hi>Vrban</hi> the sixth committed the new exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of them to, to be authentick, and
to come from the Spirit of God: and so
much is declared by <hi>Boniface</hi> the ninth in
the Bull of her Canonization, and <hi>at last
approved,</hi> saith <hi>Wadding, at the General
Council of Basil.</hi> What could be expected
less after this; than that they should have
been received as <hi>Canonical Scriptures,</hi> they
having never taken so much pains in exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
and approving any controverted
Books of the Bible, as they had done about
these revelations? And no man knows how
far their authority might have prevailed,
if the whole Sect of <hi>Dominicans</hi> had not
been engaged in the opposite opinion. For
nothing else that I can find, hath given
any discredit to her <hi>revelations</hi> but this;
which makes <hi>Cajetan</hi> call them <hi>old Wives
dreams,</hi> as <hi>Wadding</hi> confesseth.<note place="margin">Wadding. l. c. Sect. 24. p. 35<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

truth, the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> allows fair play
in the case,<note place="margin">Brev. Rom. Apr. 30. p. 808.</note> for it magnifies <hi>S. Catharine</hi> as
much as <hi>S. Brigitt:</hi> for her <hi>holy Extasies</hi>
are mentioned in the <hi>Lessons</hi> upon her day,
in one of which, <hi>were five rayes coming from
the five wounds of our Saviour to five parts
of her body; and she</hi> (being wonderfull
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:45050:145"/>
humble) <hi>prayed our Lord, that the wounds
might not appear</hi> (for fear she should have
been thought as holy as <hi>S. Francis) and
immediately the colour of the blood was chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into pure light upon her hands, and feet,
and heart. And her Confessor Raimund</hi>
(who is alwayes a principal man in these
things, as <hi>Matthias a Suecia</hi> was to <hi>S. Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitt)
without whom she was advised from
Heaven to do nothing, saw these splendid
wounds upon her body;</hi> (but by what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
did he see the wound in her
heart?) Well, though we Hereticks are
not apt to be too credulous in these cases,
the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> very gravely tells us in
the next Lesson; <hi>that her learning was not
acquired, but infused, by which she answered
the most profound Doctors in the most difficult
speculations in Divinity;</hi> but these were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to <hi>her revelations</hi> and the service she
did the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by them in a time
of <hi>Schisme.</hi> But one gift she had above
<hi>S. Brigitt,</hi> which was that while she was
on earth she could not only see, but <hi>smell
souls</hi> too, and could not endure <hi>the stench
of wicked souls,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Raynald. Annales Ecclesiast. A. D. 1380. n. 25.</note> as <hi>Raynaldus</hi> tells us from

whose revelations were published, and the

and in latter times he mentions S. <hi>Brigitt,</hi>
and S. <hi>Catharine whose revelations,</hi> he saith,
<hi>were opposed by some, but he declares for his
part, that he is not at all moved with their
arguments, for that would diminish too much
the honour due to those holy Spouses of
Christ,</hi> as he calls them; but in truth he
confesses, <hi>the honour of their Church is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in it; for,</hi> saith he, <hi>several Popes
upon diligent examination have allowed and
approved these revelations, as</hi> Eugenius <hi>the
third did those of</hi> Hildegardis <hi>as well as</hi>
Boniface <hi>the ninth, those of</hi> S. <hi>Brigitt.</hi> For
the argument from the contradiction of
these revelations, he knows not how to
come off, but by a charge of Forgery <hi>on
the Dominican side;</hi> and why might not
they as well return it on the other; unless
<hi>Matthias a Suetia</hi> Confessor to S. <hi>Brigitt</hi>
were more infallible than <hi>Raimundus,</hi> or
those who believed S. <hi>Catharine.</hi>

            <p>But this is not the only case, wherein
these <hi>female revelations</hi> so much approved
by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> are contradictory to
each other in those things whereon the
proof of a point of doctrine depends. For
who knows not to what end the <hi>revelation</hi>
of S. <hi>Gregoryes</hi> delivering the soul of <hi>Trajan</hi>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:45050:147"/>
by his prayers, is so frequently urged? and
this is confirmed by a revelation of S. <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitt</hi>
to that purpose;<note place="margin">Brigittae Revel. l. 4. c. 13.</note> from whence <hi>Salme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>

of <hi>Corpus Christi day,</hi> mentions
that as one of the great reasons of appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, <hi>that while he was in a lower capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
he understood that a revelation had been
made to certain Catholicks that this Feast
should be observed in the Church.</hi> This
which is only intimated here is at large
explained by <hi>Ioh. Diestemius Blaerus Prior</hi> of
St. <hi>Iames</hi> in <hi>Liege,</hi> where these things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.<note place="margin">Apud Bzov. Annal. To. 13. A. D. 1230. n. 16.</note>
               <q>In an <hi>Hospital</hi> hard by the
Town he tells us, there was a famous
<hi>Virgin</hi> called <hi>Iuliana,</hi> which had many
Extasies and Raptures, and so Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
a Spirit as to discern the thoughts
and intentions of her Neighbours Hearts;
she wrestled with Devils, discoursed with
the Apostles, and wrought many Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.
But one thing peculiar to her was,
that in her Prayers she almost alwayes saw
the Moon in her brightness, but with a
snip taken off from her roundness: at
which she was much troubled, but by no
means could get it out of her Phancy.
At last <hi>God</hi> was pleased to reveal it to
her, that the Moon signified the present
Church, and that fraction the want of
one solemnity more to be observed in it:
upon which she received a command
from Heaven to proclaim the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of this solemnity. For twenty
years, she prayed that God would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:45050:149"/>
her, and make choice of a more
worthy person; but none being found
she communicates it to <hi>Iohannes de Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senna,</hi>
and he to <hi>Iacobus de Trecis</hi> then
<hi>Arch-deacon</hi> of <hi>Liege,</hi> and afterwards,
<hi>Vrban</hi> 4. But although all the persons
to whom it was communicated highly
approved it; yet she was not satisfied till
<hi>(one of her Gossips,)</hi> named <hi>Isabella,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a whole years praying for it had the
same thing revealed to her, with that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance,
that this Feast had alwayes
been among the Secrets of the B. Trinity,
but now the time was come that it
should be published to the World; and
she in one of her extasies saw very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
all the heavenly orders upon
their faces, supplicating God, that to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the faith of Christians; this day
might be speedily observed. This <hi>Isabella</hi>
was so much intoxicated by this Vision,
saith the Author, that out of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of her spiritual drunkenness
(they are his own words) she declared
she would promote the observing this
Feast, although the whole world should
oppose her. Which (we may well
think) <hi>Iuliana</hi> rejoyced to hear, and
hence forwards they joyned counsels to
advance this solemnity. <hi>Iuliana</hi> gets
an ignorant young Priest to draw up an
Office for it, and while he writ, she pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:45050:150"/>
by which the Office was so well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed;
that it would melt (saith he) the
hardest hearts into devotion: and when
it was seen by Divines, they said it was
not written by man, but inspired by God
himself. And yet when Pope <hi>Vrban</hi>
published his Bull upon the credit of
these revelations, for the Celebration of
this Feast, he appointed <hi>Tho. Aquinas</hi> to
compose an Office for it, and rejected that
divine Office of <hi>Iuliana.</hi>
               </q> The Epistle
of <hi>Vrban</hi> to <hi>Eva</hi> one of the <hi>Nuns</hi> of <hi>Liege,</hi>
and a companion of the two Virgins is still
extant in <hi>Diestemius</hi> and <hi>Binius</hi> about the
institution of this <hi>Feast</hi> of <hi>Corpus Christi.</hi>
And that this was the occasion of this
Festival, is not delivered alone by <hi>Diestemius,</hi>
but by <hi>Arnoldus Bostius</hi> and <hi>Petrus Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstratensis,</hi>
by <hi>Vignier</hi> and <hi>Molanus,</hi>
(as <hi>Binius</hi> confesseth of this last,) who
can no more be suspected of partiality
in this case than. <hi>Diestemius;</hi> but we
need no other evidence than the <hi>Popes</hi>
own <hi>Bull.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Breviar. Roman 8. Maij p. 825.</note> The story of the other is
remarkable too, for it is read con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
in the <hi>Roman Breviary</hi> upon the
eighth of <hi>May. It came to pass that among
the Droves of Cattle, the Bull of a certain
inhabitant wandred from the rest, which
having long sought for, they found in the
entrance of a Cave. And when one shot an
arrow at him to destroy him, the arrow was
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:45050:150"/>
driven back again to him that shot it.
Which thing so affrighted them all, that
they durst not come near the Cave, the</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pontines
<hi>consult their Bishop, who appointed
three dayes fasting and Prayer to seek God in
the case; after the three dayes the Arch-angel</hi>
Gabriel <hi>admonisheth the Bishop, that place
was in his custody, and by that act he shewed,
that they ought to worship God there in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of him and his fellow Angels.
The Bishop and people go accordingly thither,
and they find the place already formed into
the fashion of a Temple, and there they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
divine Offices, where many Miracles were
afterwards wrought. Not long after Pope</hi>
Boniface <hi>Dedicated the Church of St.</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael
<hi>the third of the Calends of</hi> October <hi>in
which the Church celebrates the memory of

far the 5 or 6 Lessons of the present <hi>Roman

we should be so often told of <hi>Fanaticism</hi>

<pb n="258" facs="tcp:45050:151"/>
the account of <hi>Revelations</hi> made to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
or to any private persons? Do we
resolve the grounds of any doctrine of
ours into any Visions and Extasies? have
we any <hi>Festivals</hi> kept upon such occasions?
Do we collect <hi>Fanatical Revelations,</hi> and
set them out with comments upon them, as
<hi>Gonsalvus Durantus</hi> hath done those of
St. <hi>Bridgitt?</hi> Have we any mother <hi>Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi>'s

done, to the great honour and service of
the Roman Church, <hi>the sixteen Revelations
of Divine Love shewed to a devout servant
of our Lord</hi> (and Lady too) <hi>called Mother</hi>
Juliana? We have, we thank God, other
wayes of imploying our devout retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
than by reading such fopperies as
those are. Excellent men! that debarr
the people reading the <hi>Scriptures</hi> in their

off with such Fooleries, which deserve no
other name at the best than the <hi>efforts</hi> of

estimate of <hi>Christian Religion</hi> from such
Raptures and Extasies, such Visions and
Entertainments as those are, how much
must we befool our selves to think it
<hi>sense?</hi> Did ever <hi>H. N. Iacob Behmen,</hi> or

and in his benignity, and in his buxomness,
though we feel in us wrath, debate, and
strife:</hi> Of <hi>being substantially united to God;
and that, God is that goodness which may not

and between God and our soul is neither

therewith, it behooveth to seek into our Lord
God in whom it is inclosed: and that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipful

               <hi>and
our kindly substance is beclosed in Iesu with
the blessed soul of Christ, resting in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head:
and notwithstanding all this we may
never come to the full knowing of God till
we know first clearly our own soul; for into

the time that it is in the full mights, we

were to convince us of this great truth,
that we have not had so great <hi>Fanaticks</hi> and

greater in the <hi>Roman Church.</hi> And by this
means they may think to prevail upon the

that they have been strangely mistaken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

that she is no such enemy to <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiams</hi>

but that in truth she hath not only alwayes

upon the credit of their <hi>visions</hi> and <hi>revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
The most celebrated orders at this
day in the Roman Church are the <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictines,
Carthusians, Dominicans, Francis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi>
and <hi>Iesuites,</hi> and if I can prove this
concerning each of these, we shall see how
much <hi>Fanaticism</hi> hath contributed to the
support of the <hi>Roman Church.</hi> And it is a
very fair way towards the proof of it, that
<hi>Bellarmin</hi> confesseth concerning the four
first and that of <hi>Romoaldus, that they were
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:45050:153"/>
at first instituted by St.</hi> Benedict,<note place="margin">Bellar. de Pontif. Rom. l. 3. c. 18.</note> 
               <hi>St.</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaldus,
<hi>St.</hi> Bruno, <hi>St.</hi> Dominick,
<hi>St.</hi> Francis, <hi>by the inspiration of the Holy
Ghost;</hi> and for <hi>Ignatius Loyola</hi> if he do not
appear as great a <hi>Fanatick</hi> as ever hath been
in the world, we shall be contented to be
upbraided with the charge of <hi>Fanaticism</hi>
among us. It is observable in the life of
St. <hi>Benedict,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gregor. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. l. 2.</note> as St. <hi>Gregory</hi> relates in the
second Book of his <hi>Dialogues,</hi> that he was
a great hater of humane learning, and that
was the first occasion of his retiring from
the World: being very much afraid a little
knowledge should have destroyed him.
He therefore forsook not only his Studies,
but his Fathers house and business, being as
St. <hi>Gregory</hi> saith, <hi>knowingly ignorant, and
wisely unlearned:</hi> he might as well have
said ignorantly learned, and foolishly wise.
One might have suspected it had been
rather hatred of his Book, than devotion
at his age, which made him run away from
School and his Fathers house; but one of
his Visions in his Cave makes it more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
there was some other occasion of it.
But however away he goes, and only an
old <hi>Nurse</hi> with him, and he requited her
soon for it, for he by his Prayers set toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the winnowing Sieve which she had
broken in pieces, which was after hanged
up before the doors of the <hi>Church</hi> to the
<hi>Lombards</hi> times. But this is nothing to
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:45050:153"/>
his being three years in a <hi>Cave</hi> without the
knowledge of any but St. <hi>Roman,</hi> who let
him down victuals by a rope and a <hi>Bell;</hi>
and the <hi>Devil</hi> owing him a great spight,
threw a huge stone and broke the Bell.
Here he lay so close, that he was fain to be
discovered by a vision, and was so devout
that he had forgotten <hi>Easter day,</hi> till he was
put in mind of it by the person, who by a
vision was sent to him: and was so little
like a man that the shepherds took him
for a <hi>beast</hi> lying in a den. But at last he is
brought to light, and found to be a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
person; (for among superstitious
people, ignorance and devotion are most
admired together) and now many are sent
to him for education; having conquered
his amorous passions by rowling himself
naked among thornes and nettles: which
thorns a long time after St. <hi>Francis</hi> grafted
Roses upon,<note place="margin">Bollandi Acta San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum Martii. 21. not. in. vit. Bened. c. 1.</note> (as <hi>Bollandus</hi> well observes)
which bear in the coldest part of Winter,
and of them <hi>Rose water</hi> is made which is
sent as a present to the <hi>greatest Princes.</hi>
He had an admirable Sagacity in spying
<hi>Devils;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. 4.</note> for he saw a little <hi>black Devil</hi>
which led away a <hi>Monk</hi> from Prayers;
and was fain to pray two dayes with <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peianus</hi>
and <hi>Maurus</hi> that <hi>God</hi> would afford
them the <hi>Grace</hi> to see him too: and at last
<hi>Maurus</hi> being young, and his sight good,
saw him; but <hi>Pompeianus</hi> being older and
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:45050:154"/>
wiser could not. However St. <hi>Bennet</hi> sent
the <hi>little Devil</hi> packing with a stroke of
his rod, as he did at other times with the
sign of the cross: and easily caused a stone
to be lifted up whereon the Devil sate,<note place="margin">C. 9.</note>
which could not be stirred before his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
It would take up too much time to
tell of his Miracles, my business is only
with his <hi>visions</hi> and <hi>revelations,</hi> by which
he could not only foretell things to come,
but could discover absent things; so that
the <hi>Monks</hi> could not eat out of his sight,<note place="margin">C. 12, 13.</note>
but he could tell as well as if he saw the
meat in their teeth when they denyed it.
He discovered <hi>Riggo</hi>'s fraud when he came
to him in <hi>Totila</hi>'s habit,<note place="margin">C. 14, 15.</note> and told <hi>Totilas</hi>
how long he should raign; nay, if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
St. <hi>Gregory,</hi>
               <note place="margin">C. 16.</note> he knew the <hi>secrets</hi> of the
<hi>Divinity,</hi> being one <hi>Spirit</hi> with <hi>God:</hi> no
wonder then the unhappy Boy could not
hide one Flask of Wine, nor the <hi>Monks</hi>
receive handkerchiefs of the Women,<note place="margin">C. 18, 19.</note> but
he found it out, but most admirable was
his sight of his Sister <hi>Scholastica's</hi> soul
entring into Heaven in the shape of a Dove:<note place="margin">C. 34.</note>
and another time the soul of <hi>Germanus Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
of <hi>Capua</hi> in a fiery Circle carryed by
<hi>Angels</hi> to Heaven;<note place="margin">C. 35.</note> but above all was his
seeing all the world under one ray of the
<hi>Sun,</hi> which he could not do, <hi>Gregory</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
without a Divine internal light;
upon which a dispute hath been raised in
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:45050:154"/>

<hi>divine Essence</hi> or no?<note place="margin">Possevin. A par. v. S. Benedict.</note>

the other only a plain place of <hi>Scripture;
No man hath seen God at any time; the only

him.</hi> As though that were intended to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
St. <hi>Benedict</hi> and other Founders of
<hi>Religious orders</hi> and not rather the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs,
Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles</hi> who came not

with that care and accuracy which <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelus

St. <hi>Gregories</hi> life of St. <hi>Benedict:</hi> he tells us
therefore the <hi>Question</hi> is not concerning the
highest sort of abstractive contemplation
of any thing short of the Divine essence,
for that, he saith, none doubt of; but of
an <hi>intuitive vision,</hi> by which the divine
essence is seen clearly in it self immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,
and not in any created image: the
<hi>Negative</hi> he grants is held by <hi>Aquinas</hi> and
many of the <hi>Schoolmen:</hi> but yet he saith,
many Schoolmen of great note are for the
<hi>affirmative,</hi> and he deduces many arguments
to prove it from St. <hi>Gregories</hi> words: but
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:45050:155"/>
that which addes most weight to it, besides
the number of authors quoted by him, is
that <hi>Vrban</hi> 8. in a Bull upon the feast of
St. <hi>Benedict,</hi> A. D. 1632. doth expresly
assert it.<note place="margin">Ioh. Bona de divinâ Psalmodia. cap. 18. s. 3.</note> And <hi>Ioh. Bona</hi> a present <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
at <hi>Rome,</hi> saith, <hi>that St.</hi> Benedict <hi>was
rapt up into the third Heavens, where he
heard the Choire of Angels, and saw God
face to face:</hi> for which besides <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,</hi>
he cites St. <hi>Bernard, Rupertus Tuitien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,
Bonaventure, Dionysius Carthusianus,
Maximilian Sandaeus,</hi> and others. And
addes to this as extraordinary a thing as
any hath been yet said of him, <hi>that he and
his Sister</hi> Scholastica <hi>sung very distinctly in
their Mothers Wombs, a presage</hi> (saith he)
<hi>of the chearful singing of their Order.</hi> For
which he quotes several Authors of the
<hi>Benedictines,</hi> and although he grants it
may be suspected, because it doth not
occurr in the more ancient writers, yet he
justifies it by many parellel Stories. These
things are enough for St. <hi>Benedicts Enthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asme.</hi>
St. <hi>Romoaldus</hi> was as happy as
St. <hi>Benedict</hi> in his ignorance. For as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trus
Damiani</hi> reports in his life,<note place="margin">Petr. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miani vit. S. Romoal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di cap. 4.</note> when he
first entred himself under the discipline
of <hi>Marinus</hi> the <hi>Eremite,</hi> he could hardly
read his <hi>Psalter,</hi> though he had been a
<hi>Monk</hi> three years before; and he adds it
as a great instance of his patience, that
when <hi>Marinus</hi> in teaching him, did often
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:45050:155"/>
beat him with a wand upon the left side of
his head, for his dulness, he desired his
Master that he would now change his side,
for he had by his strokes quite lost his
hearing in his left eare: and yet he met
with a worse companion than <hi>Marinus;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. 7.</note>
for, for five years together he saith, the
<hi>Devil</hi> lay upon his feet and his leggs in the
night, that he could not easily stirr himself.
He was so possessed with the thoughts of
him, that a <hi>Monk</hi> could not knock at his
Cell door, but he asked the <hi>Devil,</hi> what
he did there in the Wilderness? and was
ready to encounter with the <hi>Devil,</hi> when he
found him to be one of his <hi>Brethren.</hi> But
the <hi>Devil</hi> once got him down (as he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined)
while he was saying his <hi>Psalms,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. 16.</note>
and wounded him, and bruised him sadly;
but of a sudden he rose up as sound as ever,
and went on just where he left. All the
crows and ugly birds he saw in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,<note place="margin">Cap. 17.</note>
he fancied to be <hi>Devils,</hi> and challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to fight with them; and exceedingly
triumphed when at his loud cries they flew
away. He was converted by a <hi>vision</hi> of
St. <hi>Apollinaris,</hi>
               <note place="margin">C. 2.</note> as his Father <hi>Sergius</hi> ran
stark mad with a vision of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi>
               <note place="margin">C. 14.</note>
he wept so abundantly that he never durst
say <hi>Mass</hi> in publick,<note place="margin">C. 31.</note> and bid his Brethren
have a care of shedding too many tears,
because they hurt the sight and the brain.
Yet by immediate revelation he writ an
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:45050:156"/>
excellent commentary saith <hi>Mugnotius</hi> on
the Book of <hi>Psalms,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Andreas Mugnotius de Eremo Camaldu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lensi. lib. 1. Pet. Dami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ani vit. S. Romualdi c. 50.</note> though not very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to <hi>Grammar</hi> saith <hi>Petrus Damiani;</hi> and
being led by the Divine Spirit to the top
of a Mountain, in his sleep he saw Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
reaching from thence to Heaven, and
a great many <hi>Monks</hi> going up to Heaven
upon them. A divine vision indeed! and
he meeting with <hi>Maldulus</hi> who by great

agreed about erecting a <hi>Monastery</hi> there.

to <hi>Quakerism</hi> was by <hi>Dreams and

whom neither words nor blows could bring

imployed among them, who pretended to
<hi>revelations</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> as highly as they

and some of them executed. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
which severity about fifty
years after this came forth a Book with the
Title of <hi>Evangelium aeternum,</hi> or the <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Gospel</hi> published by the <hi>Mendicant Fryers,</hi>
and supposed to be written by <hi>Iohannes
de Parma</hi> about <hi>A. D.</hi> 1254. who was <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi>
of the <hi>Franciscan Order;</hi> but the Book
was received and defended by both Orders,
as will presently appear. But it will be
first necessary to consider what the doctrines
are, which are contained in this Book; and
if ever there were higher <hi>Fanaticism</hi> than
is therein, or rather greater <hi>blasphemies,</hi> let
them have leave to triumph. The most
perfect account we have of it,<note place="margin">Eymeric. Direct. Inquisit. p. 2. c. 9.</note> is from <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>col.
Eymericus,</hi> who was himself an <hi>Inquisitor,</hi>
and tells us these Heresies or Errors are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in it.</p>
            <p>1. That the doctrine of <hi>Abbot Ioachim</hi>
(a great <hi>Fanatick)</hi> excelled the doctrine
of <hi>Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bulaei Hist. Universit. Paris. To. 3. s. 5. p. 330.</note> and consequently the New and
Old Testament.</p>
            <p>2. That the <hi>Gospel</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is not the <hi>Gospel</hi>
of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and therefore is not edifying.</p>
            <p>3. That the New <hi>Testament</hi> is to be evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:45050:160"/>
or lose its force, as the Old hath already.</p>
            <p>4. That the New <hi>Testament</hi> shall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in force above six years longer; <hi>viz.</hi>
to <hi>A. D.</hi> 1260.</p>
            <p>5. That they which shall live beyond
that time, shall be in the <hi>state of perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. That the <hi>Gospel</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> shall give way
to another <hi>Gospel,</hi> and so instead of the <hi>Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of Christ,</hi> another <hi>Gospel</hi> shall succeed.</p>
            <p>7. That no simple man is fit to instruct
men in spiritual and eternal things, but
they that <hi>walk barefoot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. That although <hi>God</hi> afflict the <hi>Iews</hi> in
this world, yet he will save them, though
they remain in <hi>Iudaism,</hi> and will in the
end deliver them from all the opposition
of men, remaining such as they are.</p>
            <p>9. That the <hi>Church</hi> hath not yet brought
forth <hi>Children,</hi> nor will do before the end
of the temporal reign: which shall be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
six years; and by this we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> which
hath brought forth many called to the faith
of Christ, is not the Church.</p>
            <p>10. That the <hi>Gospel</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> brings no
man to <hi>perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>11. That the <hi>Gospel</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>
coming, or <hi>Ioachims</hi> work obtaining (called
the <hi>Everlasting Gospel</hi> or of the <hi>Holy Ghost)</hi>
the <hi>Gospel</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> shall be done away.</p>
            <p>12. That no man in <hi>Religious Orders</hi> is
bound to expose his life for defence of the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:45050:160"/>
faith, or preserving the worship of Christ,
but other men are.</p>
            <p>13. That as when <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> came, the
things that were before must needs be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed,
because of new things coming in
their place; so when the time of the <hi>Holy
Ghost</hi> shall come, or the third state of the
world, the things that were before must be
confuted, for the sake of the <hi>New</hi> which
are to come; from whence it must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
that the <hi>New Testament</hi> must be
refuted, and the old cast away.</p>
            <p>14. That <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> were not
perfect in the contemplative life.</p>
            <p>15. That the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Clergy</hi> shall
perish; but one of a <hi>Religious Order</hi> shall
be perferred above all in dignity and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
and that as the authority under the
<hi>Father</hi> was committed to one of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
order, so under the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> to one
or some of the order of <hi>Monks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>16. That those who are over the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi>
of <hi>Monks,</hi> ought in those dayes to
think of departing from the <hi>Seculars,</hi> and
prepare themselves to return to the ancient
people of the <hi>Iews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>17. That the Preachers which shall be
in the <hi>last state</hi> of the world, shall be of
greater dignity and authority, than the
Preachers of the <hi>Primitive Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>18. That the <hi>Preachers</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> of
<hi>Religious Orders,</hi> when they shall be infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:45050:161"/>
by the <hi>Clergy,</hi> shall go over to the
<hi>Infidels;</hi> and it is to be feared, lest they
go thither for that end to bring them in
battel against the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> according
to the doctrine of S. <hi>Iohn, Apocalyps.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>These may suffice out of twenty seven,
to let the world know, where the height
of <hi>Blasphemy</hi> and <hi>Fanaticism</hi> was first
hatched; and no one could imagine, that
any who had the face or name of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
should own these things; yet they
came from those excellent and inspired
persons of the newly founded <hi>Religious
Orders.</hi> And if it had not been for the
mortal hatred that then was between the
University of <hi>Paris,</hi> and the <hi>Mendicant Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
(who usurped the <hi>Professors</hi> places in
the <hi>Vniversity</hi> against their will) God knows
how far this doctrine might have prevailed
without the least censure. For the Popes
were extreamly partial to the <hi>Fryers,</hi> and
would hear no ill of them; they now
finding them their most useful instruments
in all their quarrels with Princes,<note place="margin">Matth. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris. Hist. ad A. D. 1255. p. 909.</note> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Clergy and the People. So <hi>Matth. Paris</hi>
relating the Story of the quarrels between
the University and the <hi>Fryers,</hi> tells, <hi>That
though the King and the City were for preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the priviledges of the Vniversity; yet the
Fryers being at the Popes devotion, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them a great deal of service, were more
acceptable in the Court of</hi> Rome, <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:45050:161"/>
got the better of the Vniversity.</hi> Nay,
so zealous was <hi>Alexander</hi> the fourth in the
cause of the <hi>Fryers</hi> against the <hi>Vniversity,</hi>
that in the six years of his Popedom, he sent
out near <hi>forty Bulls</hi> against the <hi>Vniversity,</hi>
of which not one now appears in the <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larium:</hi>
but most of them are preserved
in that accurate Preface before the Works
of <hi>Gul. de Sancto Amore</hi> the zealous Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

               <note place="margin">Bulaei Hist. p. 299.</note> But not being satisfied

               <note place="margin">Gul. de S. Amore oper. p. 500.</note>
at the end of his Works, wherein he saith,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:45050:162"/>
               <hi>That he had seen no small part of that Book;
and he had heard that it doth in all contain
more than the Bible; and therein,</hi> he saith,
<hi>it is taught, that the Sacraments of the
Church are nothing, that the Gospel of Christ
is not the true Gospel; and that the Book it
self is the Gospel of the Holy Ghost, and the
everlasting Gospel; and that the Gospel of
Christ should be preached but for five years
to come; that then men shall have another
Rule of life, and the Church shall be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
managed. Which,</hi> saith he, <hi>is execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and abominable to be spoken.</hi> But not
content with bare preaching against them,
he writ a very smart Book in the name of
the <hi>Vniversity</hi> of <hi>Paris, de periculo novissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morum
temporum,</hi> of the <hi>dangers of the last
times,</hi> wherein he doth at large set forth
<hi>the hypocrisie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gul. de S. Amore de peric. novis. temp. c. 8. p. 38.</note> 
               <hi>idleness, flattery and baseness of
the Fryers;</hi> but coming to shew the near
approach of the dangers he mentions, he
saith, <hi>It is now fifty five years</hi> (for about
that time <hi>Almaric</hi> broached his doctrine)
<hi>that some have endeavoured to change the
Gospel of Christ into another Gospel, which
they said would be better, more perfect and
worthy, which they call the Gospel of the
Holy Ghost, or the everlasting Gospel; which
will by its coming turn the Gospel of Christ
out of doors;</hi> as, saith he, <hi>we are ready to
prove, out of that cursed Gospel;</hi> and a little
after he adds, <hi>That this Everlasting Gospel
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:45050:162"/>
was publickly explained at</hi> Paris, A. D. 1254.
<hi>from whence it is certain, that it would be
preached, unless there were some other thing
which hindered.</hi> And afterwards he saith,
<hi>That in that Book, this Everlasting Gospel is
said to exceed the Gospel of Christ, as much
as the light of the Sun doth that of the
Moon, or the Kernel doth the Shell.</hi> This
Book of his extreamly incensed the <hi>Fryers,</hi>
and they presently sent informations against
him to the <hi>Pope;</hi> and by their interest got
his Book to be condemned and burnt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
before the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Court</hi> at
<hi>Anagnia,</hi> and afterwards at <hi>Paris:</hi> to which
purpose the <hi>Pope</hi> published a <hi>Bull,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
the sentence of excommunication
against any who should presume to defend
it: and the Write of it was deprived of
his <hi>Ecclesiastical Promotions</hi> and banished
<hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chronicon. Nicol. Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetti ad A. D. 1256.</note> as far as the <hi>Popes</hi> power could do
it. All this was done in great haste, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Legats</hi> from the <hi>Vniversity</hi> could
appear; and when they came, three of
them recanted and returned; only <hi>Gul. de
S. Amore</hi> resolved to stand it out, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
all their objections, and persisted
still in the accusation of that <hi>horrible Book:</hi>
and at last prevailed so much, that the
<hi>Pope</hi> was fain to condemn the <hi>Evangelium
aeternum</hi> together with <hi>S. Amours</hi> Book;
but it appears how unwillingly he did it,
by his carriage in it, which is related by

<hi>Bull</hi> against it; and a Book against <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion</hi> in the highest manner hardly
procured to be condemned; and when it
is, with great fear of displeasing the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi>
and <hi>approvers</hi> of it. And since that
time, they have been very careful to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the least mention of the <hi>latter,</hi> but
very forward to set forth the other. For
in the <hi>Roman Bullarium,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bullar. Rom. Tom. 1.</note> the <hi>Bull</hi> against
<hi>S. Amours</hi> Book is set forth at large;<note place="margin">Alex. 4. Bull. 8. p. 137.</note> but
not the least intimation of any such Book
condemned as the <hi>Evangelium aeternum.</hi>
So much dearer to the <hi>Pope</hi> is the honour
of <hi>Fryers,</hi> than of <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Christian
Religion!</hi> And therefore <hi>S. Amour</hi> said
well in the University of <hi>Paris</hi> before they
went,<note place="margin">Bulae. p. 330.</note> 
               <hi>That it was to no purpose to go about
to procure the condemning that Book at</hi>
Rome, <hi>where it had so many Favourers;</hi> the
design of it being to advance the honour
of Religious Orders, though to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of the Gospel of <hi>Christ.</hi> It is well
these things were written and preserved by
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:45050:163"/>
Writers of their <hi>own Church,</hi> and persons of
the same <hi>Age</hi> (out of whom only I have
given account of them) for otherwise ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their usual Method of confuting
things which do not please them, they
would be denyed with a mighty confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and the world should be told, that
these are only the <hi>Lyes</hi> and <hi>Forgeries</hi> of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks.</hi>
But these are to their shame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in their own Books, and we can
shew them the very words, if occasion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it.</p>
            <p>§. 9. Yet we are not to think,<note place="margin">The Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticism of the <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciscans</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</note> that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

for the <hi>Franciscans</hi> had a
great hand in them too, and were as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to promote that which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
their common interest. And
notwithstanding the Popes condemning the

Writings,<note place="margin">Guido Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melit. de haeres. Abb. Ioachim &amp; Pet. Ioh.</note> yet his doctrine did in no
long time after break forth again in the
<hi>Franciscan</hi> Order. For toward the latter
end of the same Century, or as most
think,<note place="margin">Alphonsus a Castro advers. haeres. v. Apost. haer. 1.</note> in the beginning of the next in the
time of <hi>Clement</hi> the fifth appeared one <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trus
Iohannis de Oliva</hi> a great Disciple of
<hi>Ioachims,</hi> as <hi>Guido Carmelita, Alphonsus

the difference saith <hi>Alphonsus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pegna in direct. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisit. p. 2. q. 9.</note> between
them was, that <hi>Ioachim</hi> made the <hi>spiritual
State</hi> to commence from the founding
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:45050:164"/>
the <hi>Benedictine</hi> Order, but <hi>Petrus Iohannis</hi>
would have it begin only from S. <hi>Francis:</hi>
Which <hi>State,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eymeric. ib.</note> as <hi>Eymericus</hi> relates, where he
recounts his errors, <hi>began with the</hi> Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciscan
<hi>Order, when the Angel of Christ, that
is,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Haeres. 6.</note> S. Francis, <hi>did set his mark upon all
his Souldiers; and that</hi> S. Francis <hi>appeared
as Christ did with his wounds upon him.</hi> For
we are to understand, that S. <hi>Francis</hi> in one
of his Visions upon the very day of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation
of the Cross, had the same <hi>bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wounds</hi> on his <hi>hands, feet and side, which
Christ had upon the Cross, and carried them
for two years together before his death;</hi> and
lest this should be suspected, <hi>Pope Alexander
the fourth</hi> preached it in S. <hi>Bonaventures</hi>
hearing, that himself <hi>saw them,</hi> as the
sixth Lesson on S. <hi>Francis</hi> day in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Breviary,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Brev. Rom. 4. Octob. Lect. 6.</note> and <hi>Bonaventure</hi> assure us.
And who dares question the infallibility of
the Popes eye-sight? Unless the Story in
latter times of <hi>Maria Visitationis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bonavent. vit. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis. c. 18. Sect. 9.</note> as she was
called, <hi>Abbesse</hi> of the <hi>Annuntiation</hi> in <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi>
may give some suspicion of it. For
this <hi>Virgin</hi> had gained so great a reputation
for sanctity, not only in <hi>Portugal,</hi> but in
<hi>Spain, Italy</hi> and the <hi>East Indies,</hi> that she
seemed to be a fit match for S. <hi>Francis.</hi>
And she out-did him in the number of her
wounds, for she had thirty two upon her
head, caused by <hi>Christs</hi> putting his <hi>Crown of
Thorns</hi> upon her, and in her hands, and

               </gap>eet, and side, they were as exact as in
<hi>St. Francis,</hi> she made no difficulty of shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, if her Confessor bid her, but
never otherwise; lest she should seem too
much to glory in the honour which <hi>Christ</hi>
had done her. This Confessor was no less
a man, than <hi>Ludovicus Granatensis,</hi> a man
highly commended for learning and piety,
who as verily believed them, as <hi>Pope Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
did those of S. <hi>Francis.</hi> One day in
the Week she laid <hi>raggs</hi> to her wounds,
upon which the print of the wounds was
made. These <hi>rags</hi> with incredible devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
saith the Writer of the Story, were
sent to the <hi>Pope</hi> himself, and to the greatest
and most religious persons in all parts, by
whom they were received with great Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.
And when he was <hi>Inquisitor</hi> in
<hi>Sicily,</hi> he saith, he saw many of them with
her Picture, and a Book of her life and
eminent sanctity by a person of great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
which were preserved as precious
things by the Vice-roy's Lady. But this is
nothing to <hi>Gregory the thirteenth</hi> then <hi>Pope,</hi>
who writ a Letter of encouragement to
her, to go on in the same way of sanctity
she had begun. She had been examined
by the <hi>Inquisition,</hi> and her wounds were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by them after diligent search: But
at last they found what she aimed at, which
was the <hi>Revolt</hi> of <hi>Portugall</hi> from <hi>Spain;</hi>
which being once suspected, she is brought
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:45050:165"/>
before the <hi>Inquisition,</hi> and her <hi>Sanctity</hi> is
condemned, her wounds declared to be a
meer Imposture, being artificially made by
<hi>red Lead,</hi> and her self sentenced by the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitors</hi>
to a very severe pennance all her
dayes <hi>Decemb. 8. A. D.</hi> 1588. I suppose,
my Adversary having been upon the place,
hath often heard the truth of this; but if
he doubts it,<note place="margin">Lud. a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramo de Origine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisit. l. 2. tit. 2. c. 15. n. 11. tit. 3. c. 5. n. 16.</note> he may find it, as I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
it, in <hi>Ludovicus a Paramo.</hi> By which
it is very easie to ghess what it is, which
gives and preserves the reputation of these
things in the <hi>Roman Church;</hi> for if this

in the <hi>Roman Breviary,</hi> as well as those of
St. <hi>Francis,</hi> and a <hi>Festival</hi> might have been
kept in commemoration of her sanctity,
and her self as religiously invocated as the
rest of the <hi>Popes</hi> making. But supposing
<hi>Pope Alexander the fourths</hi> authority pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
so much upon the people, to believe
that S. <hi>Francis</hi> had the same wounds which
<hi>Christ</hi> had, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No wonder then, it

               <hi>The
Flowers of</hi> S Francis, that <hi>those only were
saved by the blood of Christ, who lived before</hi>
S. Francis; <hi>but all that followed, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
by the blood of</hi> S. Francis. No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
this <hi>Petrus Iohannis</hi> made <hi>the Rule of</hi>
S. Francis, <hi>to be the very same with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
and that which Christ and his Apostles
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:45050:165"/>
lived by: of which</hi> S. Francis <hi>was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
observer next to Christ and his Mother; and
that as Christ when he was to reform the world
chose twelve Apostles; so</hi> S. Francis <hi>had twelve
Brethren, by whom the Evangelical Order was
founded; that those who opposed this Order,
were the carnal persecuting Clergy, in whom
the Seat of the Beast is much more, than in
the people; that in the time of this Mystical
Antichrist, the Carnal Church shall oppose the
doctrine, life and zeal of the Saints, and
burn as it were with fire against them; but
it shall be dryed up from all spiritual Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and Grace, and the riches of Christ, and
be exposed to errors and delusion as it was with
the Iews and Greeks.</hi> Those who will not
take the pains to see how faithfully I have
translated these words out of <hi>Eymericus,</hi>
would imagine I have borrowed some of
the canting language of the modern <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.</hi>
But he goes on: saying, <hi>That as</hi>
Vasthi <hi>the Queen being cast off from the
Kingdom and Marriage of</hi> Ahassuerus, <hi>the
humble</hi> Esther <hi>was chosen to succeed in her
place, and the King made a great Feast to his
Princes and Servants: so in this last state of
the Church, the adulterous</hi> Babylon, <hi>the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Church being rejected, the spiritual Church
must be exalted, and a great and spiritual
Feast be kept to celebrate these Nuptials
with, that under the Mystical Antichrist, there
shall be overturnings and commotions, by
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:45050:166"/>
which the Carnal Church shall be terribly stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
up and moved against the Evangelical
Spirit of Christ; but that, the Whore of</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,
<hi>the Carnal Church shall fall; in which
time the Saints shall preach, saying, from this
time it is no longer the Church of Christ, but
the Synagogue of Satan, and the Habitation
of Devils, which before said in the pride of
her heart, I sit as a Queen in great honour
and glory, I rule over my Kingdom, I sit at
ease, I am no Widow,</hi> i. e. <hi>I have Bishops
and Kings on my side:</hi> that, <hi>the</hi> Roman
<hi>Church is that great Whore spoken of in the</hi>
Revelations, <hi>which hath committed fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with this world, having departed from the
worship, and sincere love, and the delights of
Christ her Spouse; and embraced the world,
the riches and pleasures of it, and the Devil,
and Kings, and Princes, and Prelates, and
all the lovers of this world.</hi> That, <hi>the
Teachers of this spiritual State, are more
properly the Gates to lead men into the wisdom
of Christ, than the Apostles themselves.</hi>
These things are expresly delivered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the doctrine of this <hi>Franciscan</hi>
Fryer by the Inquisitor <hi>Eymericus;</hi> I know,
<hi>Wadding</hi> in his <hi>Franciscan Annals</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the reputation of his Order,<note place="margin">Wadding. Annales Minorum ad A. D. 1297.</note> would
clear him from all suspicion of Heresie,
but I suppose the credit of an Inquisitor
having such opportunities to know the
truth, so near his own time, and having the
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:45050:166"/>
examination of many of his followers, is to
be relyed on rather than the testimony of
one at such a distance, and partial for the
honour of his order. Especially that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
considered which <hi>Possevin</hi> saith of <hi>Ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Possevin. Appar. v. Nicol. Ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meric.</note>
that most of his accounts of the
times a little before his own were the very
same with what was contained in a Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script
in the <hi>Vatican Library</hi> both as to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

been brought from <hi>Avignon</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> where

by <hi>Wadding</hi> or others, that the <hi>Beguini</hi> and
<hi>Fratricelli,</hi> the <hi>Beguardi</hi> and others were
his <hi>followers;</hi> and we shall find so great an
agreement in their opinions, that it would
be strange they should be accounted the
Disciples of any other.<note place="margin">Eymeric. dir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Eymericus</hi> gives
this account of them, that in the time of
<hi>Clement</hi> 5. there arose in the Province of
<hi>Narbonne,</hi> one <hi>Petrus Iohannis</hi> a <hi>Franciscan
Fryer,</hi> who published by Writing and
Preaching a great many Errours and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
in the same <hi>Province,</hi> and drew many
after him, who had spread themselves over
<hi>France, Italy, Germany,</hi> and other places,
and continued in his time, being daily
searched for, condemned by the <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitours.</hi>
They all agreed that <hi>their doctrine
was from God by immediate inspiration;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Error. 36.</note> 
               <hi>and
that all the writings of</hi> Petrus Johannis <hi>were
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:45050:167"/>
revealed to him from the Lord and that he
had declared this to some of his Friends; that
he was so great a Doctor that from the time of
the Apostles and Evangelists, there have been
none greater than he in Learning and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness:
and that his writings, theirs only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted</hi>
(wherein they fell short of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<hi>Sect) were the most useful to the
Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 10. Their doctrines may be reduced
to these four heads,<note place="margin">Of the Doctrines of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</note> 1. Evangelical pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
2. Unlawfulness of Swearing. 3. The
Doctrine of perfection. 4. Opposition to
the carnal Church. Which being joyned
with that greater degree of light which
they supposed themselves to have above all
the rest of the world, makes up a <hi>Sect</hi> of
<hi>Quakers</hi> after the Order of St. <hi>Francis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Their Doctrine of <hi>Evangelical po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty;</hi>
about which they said, <hi>That our Lord
Iesus Christ as man, and his Apostles had
nothing in proper, or in common, because they
were perfectly poor in this world; and that
this is perfect Evangelical poverty; but the
enjoying any thing though in common takes
off from the perfection of it; and that the
Apostles themselves could not without sin have
any property in any thing, and that it is Heresie
to say otherwise; therefore the rule of
St.</hi> Francis <hi>prescribing this poverty was that
which Christ observed and prescribed to his
Apostles, and was the same with the Gospel
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:45050:167"/>
of Christ, and therefore whosoever addes to it,
or takes from it (be it the Pope himself) he is
a Heretick in so doing:</hi> on which account
they condemned <hi>Iohn</hi> 22. and all the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates</hi>
and <hi>Fryers</hi> for Heresie, who opposed
this Doctrine. For we are not to imagine
a Doctrine so contrary to the beloved inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> should escape op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position:
nay it was so far from it, that it
immediately caused a breach in their own
order.<note place="margin">Papir. Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. de Episc. Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis, l. 6. v. Ioh. 22.</note> For as <hi>Papirius Massonus</hi> well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
from <hi>Petrarch, none hate poverty
more than they who profess it most;</hi> and the
<hi>Franciscan</hi> order had gotten into their hands
goodly possessions, and built magnificent
houses, and laid up great provisions of <hi>Corn</hi>
and <hi>Wine;</hi> which these followers of <hi>Petrus
Iohannis</hi> declare against as directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the rule which they professed,
being the <hi>strictest poverty;</hi> which this was
as like as hypocrisie is to sincerity, or
St. <hi>Francis</hi> to <hi>Christ.</hi> Upon this a great
division happens in the Order: between
the Brethren that followed <hi>Petrus Iohannis
de Oliva,</hi> who were called the <hi>Spiritual men,</hi>
and the <hi>Brethren</hi> of the <hi>community;</hi> both
parties appeal to <hi>Clement 5. Alexander de

in behalf of the <hi>Community,</hi> and <hi>Vbertinus
de Casali</hi> on the other side: But the <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Brethren,</hi> fearing hard usage at <hi>Rome</hi>
and from their other <hi>superiours</hi> choose new
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:45050:168"/>
ones to themselves and so make an open
<hi>Schisme.</hi> In the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Vienna, A. D.

they not only continued but spread
themselves still further. <hi>Iohn Gerson</hi> who
lived in the beginning of the next Century,
mentions not only the doctrines of the
<hi>everlasting Gospel,</hi> but those of the <hi>Begardi,</hi>
the substance of which he saith is, <hi>that a
perfect soul being reduced to God, loseth its
own will, so that it hath no other will but the
divine will, which it had from eternity in
that Ideal being which it had in God: which
being supposed, they say they may do any
thing which their affection puts them upon
without sin, because they have no will of
their own.</hi> The way of renouncing their
own wills was somewhat different, he tells
us; for the more cunning pretended to do
it only to <hi>God;</hi> but these prevailed upon
the other to renounce their own wills be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them; which when they had done,
they told them they could now sin no

Under which pretext of renounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their own wills, all manner of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
was committed among them. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
were they only in <hi>France, Italy, Sicily</hi>

<hi>but the remainders of it were still left in

<hi>These were of the same opinions with the</hi>

of the</hi> Clergy <hi>and</hi> Religious Orders, <hi>it
was a</hi> reprobate Church; <hi>and the</hi> Whore of
Babylon; <hi>but being no more content with
this, than the greatest Fanaticks of our</hi> Age,
<hi>they pretended to great things themselves,
that</hi> they were the only spiritual Congregation,
sent, and chosen out by God to bear testimony
to his truth, in the last ages; and that they,
and only they, had the power which <hi>St. Peter</hi>
had; <hi>that</hi> Geraldus Segarelli, was a plant of
Gods own planting, growing up from the root
of faith; by whom God began the work of
Reformation of his Church, to the purity,
perfection, life, state and poverty of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church, in that state wherein Christ
committed his Church to <hi>St. Peter. That</hi>
they only are the Church of God, and in that
perfection wherein the Apostles were, and
therefore are bound to live in subjection to
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:45050:175"/>
none, because their rule which was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
from Christ, is free, and hath the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
perfection, that no one can be saved who is
not of their Order, that it is a sign any one
is in a state of damnation to persecute them:
that all the Popes from <hi>Sylvester</hi> downward,
and all the Prelats were impostours and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers,
excepting only <hi>Celestine</hi> 5. who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
his Popedome, and gave leave to the
spiritual Brotherhood to separate from the rest
in the <hi>Franciscan</hi> Order. That the Orders of
Clergy and Religion are dangerous to the
Church. That no lay-men ought to pay any
tithes to Priest or Prelat, who lives not in
the same perfection and poverty which the
Apostles did. That it was as well to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God in Woods, or Stables, or Barnes, as
in consecrated Churches: That it was unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for Christians to swear at all, <hi>saith</hi> Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teolus,

mental reservations, and to deny their Sect
with their mouths, as long as they kept true
to them in their hearts. That nothing was
unlawful which was done out of a principle
of Love: and that all things, in the worst
sense, were to be common among them; and
therefore they are charged with allowing and
practising promiscuous mixtures among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<hi>if their Adversaries do not charge
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:45050:176"/>
them as unjustly in this point as the</hi> Pr<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitive
Christians <hi>were charged by the
Heathen. This is the summ of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and practices as they are reported by</hi>
Turrecremata,<note place="margin">Turrecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata Sum. de Eccles. l. 4. p. 2. c. 37.</note> Eymericus, Prateolus, Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus,

which is still observable to our purpose is,
that these were looked on as a sort of</hi>

               <note place="margin">Spondan. A.D. 1370. n. 16.</note> 
               <hi>that</hi> they were a sort of <hi>Mendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant</hi>
Fryers not approved by the Roman See;
whereas <hi>Greg.</hi> 10.<note place="margin">Raynald. A.D. 1311. n. 66.</note> in the Council of <hi>Lyons</hi>
had absolutely forbid all Orders of <hi>Mendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants</hi>
after the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council,<note place="margin">Naucler. Gen. 44. p. 986.</note> that should
not receive express confirmation from the Pope;
but his Holiness was informed, that some
who called themselves of the Apostolical Order,<note place="margin">Gaulticri Chronol. sec. 1300. c. 8.</note>
had since that time assumed to themselves a
new habit of Religion without due applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
being made to his See, and a great
number of these went up and down, as Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicants
into many parts of the world, doing
unseemly things to their own peril and the
scandal of others; especially some among
them being guilty of Heresie: therefore all
Ecclesiastical Officers, are required to admonish
and compell them to lay down their habits,
and to enter themselves among some of the
approved Religious Orders; and in case of
refusal they ought to proceed judicially against
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:45050:176"/>
them and to deliver them over to the secular
power. <hi>By which we understand the true
ground of the quarrel against them,</hi> viz.
<hi>not yielding subjection enough to the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
See, <hi>and how easily all their Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
and Villanies might be forgiven, if
they entred themselves into any of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved</hi>
Religious Orders.</p>
            <p>§. 12. <hi>As we see all the care used could

                  </note> but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders

the</hi> Sect <hi>of</hi> Illuminati, <hi>were any other than
a remainder of the</hi> Beguini <hi>and</hi> Fraticelli
<hi>whom we observed before to have got foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Spondan. Annales. A.D. 1623. n. 7.</note> Spondanus <hi>indeed and some

and were condemned by <hi>Andreas Pachecus</hi>
the general Inquisitour in <hi>Spain,</hi> in twenty six
Articles, and the seven chief of them were
burnt: but withall <hi>he saith,</hi> they were not
so much a new Sect, as a renewal of an old
one with some additions. <hi>Nay we meet
with the very same name of the</hi> Sect <hi>long
before that:</hi>

               <hi>For</hi> Ludovicus de Paramo <hi>saith,
that</hi> several Priests were taken by order of the
Inquisition in the Town of <hi>Lerena,</hi> who under
pretence of extraordinary illumination from
God, did gain upon the people, and spread
dangerous opinions among them. <hi>And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:45050:177"/>
he particularly describes them under
the names of the</hi> Illuminati,<note place="margin">Lib 3. q. 5. n. 189, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>by their</hi> pride
<hi>and</hi> disobedience <hi>to their</hi> Superiours, <hi>by their</hi>
obstinate adhering to their Illusions, <hi>and</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging
themselves in their sensual lusts;
<hi>all which fully agree to the Character
already given of the</hi> Fraticelli,<note place="margin">N. 192.</note> 
               <hi>and</hi> Begardi.
<hi>For the first, he saith</hi> they chose rather to be
broken in pieces, than give obedience to their
Bishops; <hi>for the second he proves,</hi> that as long
as they gave way to sensual lusts, their illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
could not be from God; for they who
would sleep in the divine light, <hi>as he speaks,</hi>
must have their eye-lids shut as to all worldly
vanities and pleasures, therefore we ought to
shun such illuminated,<note place="margin">N. 211.</note> or rather blind persons,
who transform themselves into Angels of light,
spreading divers doctrines and revelations
which they have;<note place="margin">N. 238.</note> 
               <hi>of whom he interprets
the</hi> Epistle of St. Iude. <hi>By all that hath
been said, this Sect seems to be nothing else
but</hi> Gnosticism <hi>revived under new shapes
and names; and with a difference of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
suitable to the age wherein it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
Spondanus <hi>gives this account of the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and practices of the modern</hi> Alumbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do's,
<hi>that</hi> under a pretence of mental Prayer
and divine contemplation, and union with God;
they despised the use of Sacraments, Preaching
the Word of God, and all holy exercises; and
did extol the other so highly, that they said
those things would not be sins in them, which
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:45050:177"/>
were so in others, and by this means com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
all impurities. <hi>Of this Sect</hi> Ignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Loyola <hi>was vehemently suspected to be,
and upon that account was cast into prison
by the</hi> Inquisition <hi>in</hi> Spain. <hi>Which</hi>
Maffeius <hi>himself doth not deny,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Maffeius in vit. Ignatii l. 1. cap. 17.</note> that
it was upon the account of the <hi>Illuminati,</hi>
and his Enthusiastical Preaching in the
Streets, <hi>that he was Questioned. But</hi>
Melchior Canus <hi>that learned</hi> Bishop <hi>of the</hi>
Canaries <hi>puts the matter out of dispute, for
in a discourse of his</hi> concerning the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Society of Iesus, <hi>preserved entire
in the hands of</hi> Dominicus Canus Bishop <hi>of</hi>
Cadiz <hi>his Nephew, and published in part by</hi>
Schioppius,<note place="margin">Schiopp. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fam. Famia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni p. 62.</note> 
               <hi>he saith,</hi> that the General of that
Order was one <hi>Innico</hi> who fled out of Spain,
lest he should be laid hold on by the Inquisition,
being suspected for the Heresie of the <hi>Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati;</hi>
and coming to <hi>Rome</hi> he desired to be
judged by the Pope, where no accuser appearing
he was absolved. <hi>He gives him the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
of a</hi> vain man; <hi>for,</hi> being once in his
company at <hi>Rome,</hi> he presently without any
occasion began to boast of his righteousness,
and the unjust persecution he had suffered in
<hi>Spain:</hi> and spake many and great things of
the revelations he had from God, without any
necessity; upon which account he saith, he
believed not anything at all concerning them.
Another day, <hi>he adds,</hi> when he went to dine
with him, he commended one of his Brethren
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:45050:178"/>
for a great Saint, who coming into the room
where they were, he presently suspected the man
to be mad: and when he talked with him about
matters of Religion, he answered heretically,
not out of design, but because he was an
Ideot, a rude, ignorant fellow. <hi>Ignatius</hi>
being confounded at this, said he was no He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick,
but a Fool; but he believed he had
some lucid intervals; and at that time by
reason of the conjunction of the Moon, he was
not a very sound Catholick. <hi>See from what</hi>
Man, <hi>the</hi> Iesuits <hi>derive the infallibility of
their faith! But although</hi> Canus <hi>was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of more learning and judgement than
a thousand</hi> Ignatius<hi>'s; yet the</hi> Iesuits <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry
him as very partial against them: for</hi>
Orlandinus <hi>in his</hi> history of the Society <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
of him</hi> as one of the bitterest enemies
they had in the beginning of their Society;<note place="margin">Orlandin. hist. Societ. Iesu l. 8. n. 46.</note>
               <hi>for he every where set them forth as the</hi>
fore-runners <hi>of</hi> Antichrist, <hi>and explained
the Prophecy of them, concerning the men</hi>
that should be in the last times.<note place="margin">2 Tim 3. 1. to the 8. v.</note> 
               <hi>Wherein it
is said,</hi> Men shall be lovers of themselves,
covetous, boasters, blasphemers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours,
heady, high-minded, lovers of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
more than lovers of God, having a Form
of Godliness, but denying the power thereof:
For of this sort are they which creep into
houses, and lead Captive silly Women laden
with sins, led away with divers lusts, <hi>&amp;c.
The same thing (saith</hi> Orlandinus <hi>and
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:45050:178"/>
truly) was charged upon</hi> the Orders of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans</hi>
and <hi>Franciscans</hi> as well as them:
<hi>and we shall not quarrel with them which
order of them all hath the greatest share in
the accomplishment of this Prophecy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 13. That which is our present busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,<note place="margin">The Jesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites Order founded in Fanaticism.</note>
is to shew that this Order was insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
as the other were upon the credit of
<hi>visions</hi> and <hi>revelations;</hi> for <hi>Ignatius</hi> was
certainly as <hi>Ignorant</hi> and <hi>Enthusiastical</hi> as
St. <hi>Francis</hi> himself; and to prove this, I
shall only make use of those of his own
Order, who have writ his life, <hi>(Maffeius,
Orlandinus</hi> and <hi>Ribadeneira)</hi> and pursue it
no farther than the institution of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
as I have done with the other. The
first remarkable thing in him was that he
was converted by reading the <hi>Legends</hi> of
the <hi>Saints,</hi> as <hi>Don Quixot</hi> began his <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantry</hi>
by reading <hi>the old Romances:</hi> I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how <hi>Ignatius</hi> did to read them, for
<hi>Maffeius</hi> describes him,<note place="margin">Maff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ius vit. Ignat. l. 1. c. 1.</note> 
               <hi>as one that had
hardly ever learnt his letters:</hi> but it is possible
St. <hi>Peter</hi> taught him, for they all write
that St. Peter <hi>appeared to him,</hi>

               <hi>before he
was so far recovered as to be able to read.</hi>
But his Country-man was not more moved
with the adventures of former <hi>Knights;</hi>
than <hi>Ignatius</hi> was with the stories of
St. <hi>Dominick</hi> and St. <hi>Francis,</hi> for these
<hi>Maffeius</hi> tells us, did <hi>particularly work upon
him;</hi> in so much that before he took
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:45050:179"/>
up a firm resolution of <hi>Religious Errantry,</hi>
he would put cases to himself of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
<hi>Adventures</hi> of those two <hi>illustrious
Heroes,</hi> and found himself to have mettle
enough to <hi>undertake any of them:</hi> and
therefore in a fit of zeal one night <hi>he gets
out of his bed and fell down upon his knees
before an Image of the B. Virgin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ribadencira c. 1.</note> 
               <hi>and in that posture vowed himself</hi> her <hi>Knight.</hi>

                  </gap>. 12.</note>
Which is a circumstance so considerable,
I admire that <hi>Maffeius</hi> omits it; as he doth
likewise <hi>the strange noise in the house, the
trembling of the room and the breaking of the
glass windows that time:</hi> an argument
saith <hi>Orlandinus,</hi> that the <hi>Devil then took
his leave of him,</hi> although there be some
reason to doubt it. After this the <hi>V. Mary</hi>
appeared to him with a great deal of glory
with her Child in her lap (and all this
while, for the vision continued for some
time, he thought himself awake) by which
sight he was hugely animated for all his
future adventures. The first whereof was
to a place of great devotion to the <hi>B. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,</hi>
called <hi>Montserrat,</hi> and in the way thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he was like to have begun his first
adventure with a <hi>Moore</hi> who allowed the
<hi>B. Virgin</hi> to have been so till her delivery,
but would not yield it afterwards; at
which <hi>Ignatius,</hi> considering whose <hi>Knight</hi>
he was, began to be so inraged, that he
thought it necessary to revenge her quarrel
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:45050:179"/>
upon him, but disputing with himself what
to do, and the <hi>Moore</hi> being gone another
way, he leaves the cause to the wisdome of
the <hi>Mule,</hi> and puts the Reines in his neck,
that if he followed the <hi>Moores</hi> way at the
parting of the two wayes he would have
his life, but the good <hi>Mule</hi> understanding
his Riders mind, left the beaten road and
went on to <hi>Montserrat;</hi> where a remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Ceremony was performed by him; for
as <hi>Orlandinus</hi> and <hi>Maffeius</hi> expresly say,<note place="margin">Orla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Ignatius <hi>having read in Books of Chivalry,
that the ancient Knights at their first entring
upon that hononourable imployment, were
wont to watch all night in their arms;</hi> he
thought it fit to begin his <hi>Errantry</hi> in the
same manner, he therefore hangs up his
<hi>Sword</hi> and <hi>Dagger</hi> before the <hi>Altar</hi> of the
<hi>B. Virgin,</hi> and puts on his habiliments, but
instead of his shining Armour, he had gotten
a long <hi>Coat</hi> of Sack-cloth, with a cord
about it, at which he hangs his bottle for
water, and instead of his <hi>Lance</hi> a plain
Crab-tree staffe, with a wicker shooe upon
one foot and the other naked, having no
<hi>Morrion</hi> on his head, but exposed that to
the violence of the weather. All these
habiliments (having procured them by
the way,) he hung at the pummel of his
Saddle when he entred the <hi>Town</hi> saith
<hi>Maffeius,</hi>

him in his wits) but he puts them
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:45050:180"/>
not on till he came to the sacred place
where he was by the <hi>Laws of Chivalry</hi>
to watch in them, and so he did, say they,
<hi>sometimes standing, sometimes kneeling, and
devoting himself with all his might to the
service of the B. Virgin.</hi> Which having
done, <hi>early the next morning</hi> (for that is
a necessary circumstance too in the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of Chivalry) <hi>away he goes for Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resa,</hi>
where he takes up his lodging in
the <hi>Town-Hospital,</hi> and lets his Haire and
Nailes grow, and beggs from door to

was seven houres every day in vocal pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
lay upon the bare ground, and all to

Which sort of life growing
very uneasie to him, he was once near
saith <hi>Maffeius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Maffeius l. 1. c. 6.</note> throwing himself out of a
Window to put an end to it; but <hi>God</hi>
(having designed his order for a further
punishment to the world) not permitting
that; not long after he had such clear
<hi>divine revelations,</hi>
               <note place="margin">C. 7.</note> that in a moment of
time, saith <hi>Maffeius,</hi> he understood the
greatest mysteries of <hi>Religion,</hi> and the
most subtle speculations in <hi>Philosophy</hi>
(especially the way of <hi>Gods</hi> making the
World, made clear to him, but not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible
to others) which other men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
attain to with the hardest study and
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:45050:180"/>
pains.<note place="margin">Orland. l. 1. n. 27.</note> In one of his Visions, saith <hi>Orlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinus,</hi>
while he was repeating the Horary
Prayers of the <hi>B. Virgin,</hi> he saw the
<hi>B. Trinity,</hi> as plainly as we do one another,
under <hi>a corporeal representation,</hi> and was
so full of joy at it, that he could not hold
weeping before all the people, and was so
enlightned by it, that although he was yet
very ignorant, he began to write a Book
<hi>of the glories of the B. Trinity.</hi> In one of
his extasies he continued <hi>eight dayes,</hi> in
which it is probable, saith the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,<note place="margin">N. 28.</note>
he saw <hi>the frame and model of the

saw all the consequences of it too. After
this in order to his voyage to <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
away he goes for <hi>Barcelona</hi> where <hi>Elizabeth
Rosella</hi> espying him at Church sitting
among the Boyes,<note place="margin">N. 32.</note> she saw a great shining
about his mouth, and heard a voice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
her, which bid her call that man to
her house.<note place="margin">Ribadeneira c. 4.</note> While he was in <hi>Italy</hi> in his

               <note place="margin">Orland. l. 1. n. 34.</note> at <hi>Venice</hi> one of the Senatours
had a vision concerning him, checking him
for lying in so much state, while that

Visions were grown so familiar with him
now, that it is to no purpose to recount
those which he had at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and
elsewhere. In his return through <hi>Italy,</hi>
               <pb n="314" facs="tcp:45050:181"/>
the <hi>Spanish</hi> Souldiers used him hardly,
taking him for a Spy, and carryed him
to their Commander;<note place="margin">N. 44.</note> now saith <hi>Orlandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
it had been his custome not to give men
any titles of respect, but to call them only
by their common names; and he questioned
a little with himself whether he ought to
break that custome now he was to appear
before the Commander, and resolves it in
the Negative, because to do it proceeded
from too great fear of men: therefore being
brought before him, he gives him no testimony
of respect either in his words or actions;</hi>
and (both <hi>Maffeius</hi> and <hi>Orlandinus</hi> testifie)
<hi>he would not put off his Hat to him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Maff. c. 16.</note> By
which we understand, who was the first
Founder of that <hi>Fanatick</hi> Sect among us,
which is distinguished so much from

men. Upon this the Commander severely
rebuked the Souldiers, for bringing a <hi>mad
man</hi> to him, at which they were so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
that he might have saved himself the
labour of whipping himself that day;
they doing him that office very effectually.
Being returned to <hi>Barcelona</hi> at thirty three
years of <hi>Age</hi> he begins to learn his <hi>Grammar,</hi>
but as <hi>Maffeius</hi> observes,<note place="margin">Maff. l. 1. c. 16.</note> he could not have
<hi>Amo</hi> in his mouth, but his mind was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
he knew not whither, and was so
full of <hi>visions</hi> all that while, that he could
not remember one word that he learnt;
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:45050:181"/>
upon which he beggs his <hi>Master,</hi> falling in
great humility at his feet (having it seems
more reverence for him, than he had for
the <hi>Spanish Officer)</hi> that he would tye him
punctually as he did the Boys to his Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,<note place="margin">Orland. hist. l. 1. n. 47.</note>
and if he could not say them, that
he might be <hi>whipt</hi> as they were. But as
dull as he was at his Book, he had so
great <hi>elevations</hi> in his <hi>Prayers,</hi> that (if we
believe him) one <hi>Iohn Paschal,</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. 49.</note> saith <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landinus,</hi>
saw him raised up from the

follows his former course; he and his

companions in an <hi>Enthusiastical</hi> manner
(being meer <hi>lay-men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Maffei. l. 1. c. 17.</note> as <hi>Maffeius</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth)
<hi>going up and down the Streets,
Preaching in all places, and to all sorts of
persons;</hi> and being examined by the <hi>Sub-prior</hi>
of the <hi>Dominicans</hi> what <hi>Studies</hi> they
followed, <hi>Ignatius</hi> very fairly confessed the
truth, that they were <hi>unlearned.</hi> He then
asked him, why they took upon them to
Preach; <hi>Ignatius</hi> very subtilly told him,
they did not <hi>Preach;</hi> they did only <hi>hold
forth</hi> to the people in a familiar manner
concerning <hi>vertue</hi> and <hi>vice,</hi> and thereby
endeavoured to bring them to the hatred
of one and love of the other. The <hi>Sub-prior</hi>
told him this was Preaching, which
no one could pretend to do, but either
by learning, or immediate inspiration of
the Holy Ghost; and since you do not
pretend to learning, you must pretend to
be inspired. Here <hi>Ignatius</hi> finding himself
caught; resolutely denyed to give him any
answer, unless he were legally impowred
to examine him. <hi>Say you so,</hi> said the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minican?</hi>
I will take care of that sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
So they were three dayes kept in the
<hi>Convent,</hi> and after that by order of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
of <hi>Salamanca,</hi> were committed to close
Prison, where he Preached to the people
with great zeal, who now flocked in great
numbers to him; and gloried as much in his
sufferings, and talked at the same rate, that
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:45050:182"/>
the Ring-leaders of the <hi>Quakers</hi> are
wont to do among us. And just with
the same resolution, when the rest of the
Prisoners made their escape by the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of the keepers, <hi>Ignatius</hi> and his
companions would not stirr: When they
were called to answer, <hi>Ignatius</hi> Preached
at large upon several points of Divinity
to them, under pretence of answering
questions. After twenty two dayes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
to submit themselves to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Church,</hi> they are dismissed,
but with a charge in four years time not
to meddle with nice Cases of Conscience,
which <hi>Ignatius</hi> took with so much indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
that he had a present impulse upon
his mind to be gone; and no consideration
whatever could hinder him, but away he
must go to <hi>Paris,</hi> to see if he could meet with
any better success there. And accordingly
he begins his journey, driving all his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before him, which was an <hi>Asse laden
with Books,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Maffei. l. 1. c. 18.</note> as <hi>Maffeius</hi> relates, and so
reaches <hi>Barcelona,</hi> and afterwards arrived
safe at <hi>Paris.</hi> Where being sensible of his
own ignorance and dulness, he resolves to
ply his Book better, and to that end enters
himself among the Boyes in the <hi>School</hi> and
begins his <hi>Grammar</hi> again. A sad case!
that after two years <hi>Schooling</hi> at <hi>Barcelona,</hi>
being at two <hi>Vniversities</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and
having so many <hi>revelations,</hi> he should be
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:45050:183"/>
yet so great a <hi>Dunce</hi> that he could not tell
the rules of <hi>Grammar.</hi> Now he finds it
necessary to <hi>pray</hi> and <hi>whip</hi> less and to <hi>study</hi>
more. Here he finds so cold a reception,
that Hospitals, Begging, help from Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
men, were all little enough to keep
him at first from <hi>starving;</hi> but however
after eighteen months spent in learning a
little <hi>Latin,</hi> he applyes himself to <hi>Philosophy,</hi>
but the <hi>Enthusiastick</hi> heat of his brain was
so great, that he had much adoe to keep
his mind to it, but at last he obtained his
Degree in <hi>Philosophy</hi> after three years and
a half study, or at least so much time spent
there. Then he goes to the <hi>Dominican
School</hi> to learn <hi>Divinity,</hi> where he got <hi>just
enough to keep him from being a Heretick;</hi>
for so much <hi>Maffeius</hi> his words imply.
All this while his <hi>Enthusiastick head</hi> was
full of <hi>projects</hi> in order to the drawing
<hi>Disciples</hi> to himself, that he might in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of former <hi>Heroes,</hi> Found a <hi>new order:</hi>
for this it is apparent he aimed at, and for
the sake of this he went through so many
difficulties, and pretended so much to <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm,</hi>
without which he knew his design
could not be compassed.<note place="margin">Orlandin. hist. Soc. Ies. l. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Orlandinus</hi>
therefore tells us, that being at <hi>Antwerp,</hi>
(as he used to make excursions sometimes
from <hi>Panis</hi> to beg a subsistence) being in
a company of Merchants he looked sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly
upon a young Merchant, and (not
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:45050:183"/>
knowing what effect such words might
have upon him afterwards) he called him
aside, and told him <hi>he ought to thank God
who had chosen him to build a Colledge for
the Society of Iesus in his own Countrey.</hi>
By which it is plain what he designed at
that time, before he had yet formed any
thing like a <hi>Society;</hi> and the same Author
would have men believe that <hi>God</hi> had then
revealed it to him that he should found
that <hi>Society,</hi> otherwise, he saith well, <hi>no
man would have taken so much pains as he
did, unless he had such a thing in his head.</hi>
During his abode at <hi>Paris,</hi> he had prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon three <hi>Students,</hi> and the first thing
he perswaded them to, was to give away
all that they had and their <hi>Books</hi> too, and
to beg their bread; which caused a great
heat in the <hi>Vniversity,</hi> he being suspected
to have made them mad, and by force
they took them away from the <hi>Hospital</hi>
whither he had drawn them. I omit his
flying, or rather being carryed as it were
in a rapture from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Rouen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Orland. n. 68, 69.</note> and the
joy and extatick expressions he had in it;
his standing up in dirt and mire to the
neck, to represent to his companion the
<hi>filthiness of the sin he lived in,</hi> his so nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
escaping being publickly <hi>whipt</hi> in the
University for seducing the <hi>Students,</hi> that
<hi>Orlandinus</hi> makes it almost a Miracle:<note place="margin">N. 71.</note> But
we are now to take notice that his design
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:45050:184"/>
being to form a <hi>Society,</hi> he had for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
used himself to all the arts of <hi>insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
imaginable,<note place="margin">Maffeius l. 1. c. 21.</note> accommodating himself
to the humours of the persons he had to do
with, endeavouring to oblige all men with
expressions of the greatest kindness,<note place="margin">Orland. n. 75.</note> bearing
all affronts with a wonderful dissimulation,
as <hi>Maffeius</hi> describes him. By these arts
he labours to get some of the most hopeful
<hi>Students</hi> in the University to him, and at
last prevailes upon nine to joyne with him:
he studies their humours and applies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
accordingly, not acquainting them at
first with his design, but by degrees pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
them for it;<note place="margin">N. 84.</note> among them <hi>Xaverius</hi>
at first laughed at him and despised him,
but was at last won by his obsequiousness,
flattery, and insinuation. And finding his
former Disciples soon grew weary of him
and forsook him, he resolves to tye these
faster, and to that end appoints a meeting
in a <hi>Church,</hi> dedicated to the <hi>B. Virgin</hi> in
the <hi>Suburbs</hi> of <hi>Paris;</hi> where they all so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
vow before receiving the <hi>Eucharist</hi>
(none but themselves being present) ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to go to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> or to offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the <hi>Popes</hi> service; which was
done <hi>A. D.</hi> 1534. upon the day of <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption</hi>
of the <hi>B. Virgin</hi> to whose <hi>Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage</hi>
they particularly devoted themselves.
After this <hi>Ignatius</hi> fearing their relapse,
kept them together as much as might be,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:45050:184"/>
and used all means to prevent any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
happening among them, having now
gotten persons to his mind, and for fear
the Friends of some of his chief confidents
in <hi>Spain</hi> should take them off,<note place="margin">N. 96.</note> he offers to
go himself and dispatch their business for
them.<note place="margin">Maffeius l. 2. cap. 1.</note> In his return to <hi>Spain</hi> he observes his
former course of <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Begging,</hi> and
was followed by such a multitude of people
that he was fain to Preach in the <hi>Fields,</hi> where
(which deserves admiration in so weak and
mortified a man) though he could not raise
his voice, yet it was heard distinctly above <hi>a
quarter of a mile,</hi>

               <hi>Ignatius</hi> was prevailed upon now
by his Disciples to make use of a <hi>horse</hi> in his
journey to <hi>Spain,</hi> which when he was come
thither he left to an <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

looked on with so much reverence that
no man durst use him afterwards, but as <hi>a
consecrated horse</hi> was preserved in ease and
good pasture all his life time. At <hi>Venice,</hi> at the
time appointed, his companions meet him,
where they debate their voyage to <hi>Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Orland. l. 1. n. 111.</note>
and their custome <hi>Orlandinus</hi> saith
was this, <hi>in any matter of debate, they were
to joyne together in Prayer, and after seeking
God, what opinion the most were of that they
resolve upon, which they observed,</hi> saith he, till
the self-denying <hi>Ignatius,</hi> was, after much
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:45050:185"/>
               <hi>seeking God</hi> in their way made the <hi>General;</hi>
and then <hi>his Will was to rule them:</hi> after a
years stay about <hi>Venice</hi> (their courage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now cooled as to <hi>Hierusalem)</hi> wherein
<hi>Ignatius</hi> and the rest that were yet <hi>Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
entred into <hi>Orders,</hi> they determine to
go to <hi>Rome,</hi> and submit themselves wholly
to the <hi>Popes</hi> pleasure: and in the mean time
wander about the Countrey, Preaching in
the <hi>Streets</hi> and <hi>Market places,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Maff. l. 2. c. 4.</note> and making
use of the <hi>Bulks</hi> of <hi>Shops</hi> for their <hi>Pulpits,</hi>
and <hi>invited the people to hear them,</hi> saith
<hi>Maffeius, with a loud voice and whirling their
Caps over their heads;</hi> and though few un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
them, being strangers, yet all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
and commended them, and no doubt
they converted many, as their followers
have done, from the use of Laces and
Ribbands. All this while, since <hi>Ignatius</hi>
began to have any smattering of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
we read little of his <hi>visions</hi> and <hi>revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi>
but the time coming near that he
hoped for a confirmation of his Order
from the <hi>Pope;</hi>
               <note place="margin">L. 2. C. 5.</note> now saith <hi>Maffeius,</hi> he
began to have them again as frequently as
he had at <hi>Manresa</hi> (which in a kind of a
<hi>religious jest,</hi> he saith, he was wont to call
his <hi>primitive Church)</hi> nay he exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them: for what he now saw, being
above humane nature cannot be expressed;
only one <hi>Vision</hi> did him a great deal of
service, which was, that lying in a trance
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:45050:185"/>
which was frequent with him as well as
<hi>Mahomet,</hi> he saw <hi>God the Father commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
Ignatius <hi>and his Brethren to his Son
Iesus bearing his Cross; whom he very
kindly received, and spake these words with
a smile to</hi> Ignatius, <hi>I will be favourable to
you at</hi> Rome: which gave him and his
companions great comfort. At <hi>Rome,</hi>
hearing the fame of St. <hi>Benedict</hi> and his
<hi>Revelations,</hi> or remembring them in the
<hi>Legends,</hi> he withdraws to the same place,
<hi>Monte Cassino,</hi> and there it fell out luckily
(that he might come behind none of them
in <hi>visions)</hi> as St. <hi>Benedict</hi> saw the soul of
<hi>Germanus</hi> go to Heaven, so did he in the
very same manner the soul of <hi>Hozius</hi> one
of his <hi>Society;</hi> and a little after as he was
praying to the <hi>Saints</hi> he saw <hi>Hozius</hi> among
them all. Notwithstanding all this, they
met with great difficulties at <hi>Rome;</hi> but
<hi>Pope Paul</hi> 3. being throughly satisfied in
the main point, of their being <hi>serviceable</hi>
to the <hi>interest</hi> of that <hi>Church,</hi> all other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
were soon conquered, and the <hi>Pope</hi>
himself became <hi>Enthusiastical</hi> too,<note place="margin">Maff. l. 2. c. 12.</note> and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out, <hi>having read,</hi> saith <hi>Maffeius, the first
draught of the rules of the Society made by</hi> Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,
<hi>The Spirit of the Lord is here,</hi> and many
things to the same purpose. But one of the
<hi>Cardinals</hi> to whom the examination of them
was committed still opposing the establishing
this <hi>Order, Ignatius</hi> flyes to his usual refuges,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:45050:186"/>
for besides <hi>fastings, prayers, keeping of dayes,</hi>
&amp;c. he and his Friends offered <hi>three thousand
Masses</hi> for this end alone: (and it must
be a hard heart indeed that would not
yield with so much suppling) this <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal</hi>
all of a sudden quite changed his
mind and commended the business himself
to the <hi>Pope:</hi> and so the Society of <hi>Iesus</hi>
was confirmed by the <hi>Popes Bull, 3 Octob.
A. D.</hi> 1540. to the joy of <hi>Ignatius</hi> his heart,
and soon after he was made <hi>General</hi> of the
<hi>Order,</hi> which he accepted with as many
tears and protestations, and intreaties (till
he plainly saw <hi>it was the will of God it must
be so)</hi> as ever any <hi>Vsurper</hi> took the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
into his hands, which he had most
eagerly sought after. And now let the
world judge, whether there hath appeared
a greater <hi>Enthusiast</hi> or <hi>pretender</hi> to <hi>revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
than <hi>Ignatius</hi> was, since the dayes of
<hi>Mahomet,</hi> and St. <hi>Francis?</hi> Methinks they
might be ashamed to upbraid us with the
<hi>Fanaticism</hi> of the <hi>Quakers</hi> and such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
the chiefest of whom fall very much
short of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> in those very things for
which they are condemned by us, yet any
one who compares them would imagine,
the <hi>life of Ignatius</hi> had been their <hi>great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar.</hi>
I know not whether any of that
<hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>religious order</hi> of <hi>Iesuits,</hi> had
any hand in forming this <hi>new Society</hi>
among us (as hath been frequently sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested)
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:45050:186"/>
but if one may guesse the <hi>Father</hi>
by the <hi>Childs</hi> likeness, <hi>Ignatius Loyola</hi> the
<hi>founder</hi> of the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> was at least the
<hi>Grandfather</hi> of the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 14. Thus I have gone through the most
illustrious Orders of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick way of devotion among them.</note>
and shewed how they have been founded
on <hi>Fanaticism,</hi> and given encouragement
thereby unto it. It remains now that I
consider the <hi>way</hi> of <hi>devotion</hi> in greatest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
among them, and prove that it doth
encourage and promote <hi>Enthusiasme.</hi> For
this, we are to take notice that those of the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> who have set themselves
to the Writing Books of Devotion, have
with great zeal recommended so mystical
and unintelligible a way of devotion, as
though their design had been only to amuse
and confound the minds of devout persons,
and to prepare them for the most gross <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasme</hi>
and extravagant illusions of
Fancy. But this is the fruit of leaving the
<hi>Scriptures</hi> and that most plain and certain
way of <hi>Religion</hi> delivered therein; there
can be no end of Phantastical modes of
devotion, and every superstitious <hi>Fanatick</hi>
will be still inventing more, or reviving
old ones. No Laws or Rules publickly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
can serve their turn, they must have
something peculiar to themselves to gain
a reputation of greater sanctity by; and
it is hard, if they do not light upon some
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:45050:187"/>
affected phrases, unintelligible notions, ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
or singular postures, that they may
be sure to charge those with following
carnal reason who condemn them. And
they triumph in nothing more, than when
they can handsomely revenge themselves on
that bitter enemy of theirs called <hi>Reason,</hi>
which they never do with greater pleasure
than when they pretend it to be upon the
account of <hi>Religion.</hi> In the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>Rome</hi> the case hath been thus; among them
as in all <hi>Religions</hi> and places in the World,
there are some persons of a temper natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
disposed more to <hi>Religion</hi> than others
are; being melancholy, thoughtful, tender,
and easily moved by hopes and fears. These
do more easily receive the impressions of
<hi>Religion,</hi> which they being possessed with,
if they be not carefully governed, are
more lyable to fall into the dotages of <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,</hi>
or to be transported by the heats
of <hi>Enthusiasme.</hi> Against both of them
there can be no better cure imaginable than
the true understanding the nature and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
of the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> which
fills our minds with a true sense of <hi>God</hi>
and <hi>goodness,</hi> and so arms us against <hi>supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and withall acquaints us that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is in the use of
the greatest reason and prudence, and so
prevents the follies of <hi>Enthusiasme.</hi> But it
being so much the design of that <hi>Church</hi> to
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:45050:187"/>
keep the members of it from knowing any
thing against her interest, so much as the
true practice of Christianity is, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
keeping the Bible out of the hands of
the people, they must substitute some other
wayes in the room of that, to gratifie the
earthy dulness of a <hi>superstitious</hi> temper, and
the airiness and warmth of the <hi>Enthusiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</hi>
For the former, they are abundantly
provided by a tedious and ceremonious way
of external devotion as dull and as cold as
the earth it self; to the other they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<hi>abstractedness of life, mental prayer,
passive unions, a Deiform fund of the soul,
a state of introversion, divine inspirations,</hi>
which must either end in <hi>Enthusiasme</hi> or
madness. And the perfection of this state
lying in <hi>an intime Vnion with God (as they
speak) whereby the soul is Deified,</hi> is to be
attained only <hi>in the way of unknowing,</hi> (for
nothing so dangerous as the <hi>use</hi> of <hi>reason)</hi>
and <hi>self-annihilation</hi> and many other things
as impossible to be understood as practised.
Which makes it difficult to give any account
of such unintelligible stuffe, for we must
only grope in obscurity and profound dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and draw a <hi>Night piece</hi> without lights.
This way came first into request in the
<hi>Monastick</hi> orders by the examples of their
founders, as will easily appear by our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
discourse; but the men who most
solemnly preached and divulged it were
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:45050:188"/>
               <hi>Rusbrochius, Suso, Harphius, &amp;c.</hi> and
he who in these latter ages hath ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together most that had been said
before him, and is commended by <hi>Balthasar
Corderius</hi> and others as a most sublime in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter
of mystical Divinity,<note place="margin">Corderii Isagog. in mystis. Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log. D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

phrases as an account of their Divinity; but
I rather choose to do it, chiefly from a late
Author published by Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> not many
years since, who after his many turnings
and changes of opinions sits down at last
(as appears by his publishing <hi>Mother Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana's</hi>
revelations and the <hi>Preface</hi> to <hi>Sancta
Sophia)</hi> with the deserved Character of a
<hi>Popish Fanatick.</hi> Which Book of <hi>Sancta
Sophia</hi> being compiled by Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> out of
many writings of <hi>Father Augustin Baker,</hi>
and set forth <hi>A. D.</hi> 1657. with large ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probations
at the beginning and end of it, I
hope no doctrine contained therein will be
thought a scandal to their <hi>Church.</hi> The
design of it is as the title tells us, <hi>To give
directions for the Prayer of Contemplation,</hi> &amp;c.
I would they had given directions for
understanding it in the first place, for if we
have no other help than what Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>
gives in his Preface, we may as well hope
to understand the <hi>Quakers Canting</hi> as
Mr. <hi>Cressy's.</hi> Let the Reader judge by
these few passages in his Preface.

               <hi>The only proper disposition towards the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
supernatural irradiations from Gods
holy Spirit is an abstraction of life,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Preface to</hi> Sancta So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia. s. 33.</note> 
               <hi>a seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
from all business that concern others</hi>
(though it be their salvation) <hi>and an atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
to God alone in the depth of the Spirit:</hi>
and a little after, <hi>the lights here desired and
prayed for are such as do expel all images of
creatures, and do calm all manner of passions,
to the end that the soul being in a vacuity,
may be more capable of receiving and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
God in the pure fund of the Spirit.</hi>
What this <hi>pure fund of the Spirit</hi> means, I
had been somewhat to seek for, had not
<hi>Lud. Blosius</hi> in the Preface to his <hi>spiritual
Institution</hi> told us, that <hi>the Deiform fund of
the soul,</hi> is the <hi>simple essence of the soul
stamped with a divine impress,</hi> or if this be
not plain enough, <hi>that from whence ariseth
a super-essential life:</hi> but if yet it cannot
be understood, we may be the less troubled
at it, since the same Author saith afterward,
<hi>that very few do know that hidden fund of
their souls,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lud. Blo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>or believe that they have such a
thing within them.</hi> It being, it seems, like
some very cunning drawer in a <hi>Cabinet</hi>
where the main treasure lyes, which the
owner himself cannot find out, till it be
broken to pieces; for <hi>self-annihilation</hi> is
necessarily required in order to it. And
this <hi>super-essential life,</hi> as he admirably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
it, is a way of knowing without
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:45050:189"/>
thoughts, of seeing in darkness, of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
without reason, of unknowing
<hi>God</hi> by perceiving him, of being melted
and brought to nothing first, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lost and swallowed up in <hi>God;</hi> by
which means all created being is put off,
and that which is only divine put on, being
changed into <hi>God,</hi> as iron heated into the
nature of fire. This being the <hi>state</hi> of
<hi>perfection</hi> aimed at here in this world, we
must now consider the directions given in
order to it. To this end in the first place,
<hi>a contemplative state is commended above an
active as more perfect,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sancta So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia treat. 1. c. 3. s. 1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>and more easie, more
simple and more secure from all errours and
illusions which may be occasioned by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreet
use of Prayer.</hi> Where by an <hi>active</hi>
and <hi>contemplative state</hi> we must not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
what we commonly do by those
terms,<note place="margin">Treat. 1. c. 1. s. 4, 5.</note> but the <hi>active-state</hi> is, <hi>the use of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning
and internal discourse to fix our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
upon God, and expressing it self in
sensible devotion and outward acts of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to Gods will;</hi> the <hi>contemplative</hi> in the
Authors language is, <hi>seeking God in the
obscurity of faith with a more profound in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversion
of Spirit, and with less activity and
motion in sensitive nature, and without the
use of grosser images; and such souls are
not of themselves,</hi> he saith, <hi>much inclined to
external works; but they seek rather to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
themselves and inflame their hearts to
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:45050:189"/>
the love of God by internal, quiet and pure
actuations in spirit, by a total abstraction
from creatures, by solitude both external and
especially internal, so disposing themselves to
receive the influxes and inspirations of God,
whose guidance chiefly they endeavour to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
in all things.</hi> Now, he saith, <hi>the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of such a state above the other lyes in
this;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sancta So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia. cap. 3. S. 2.</note> 
               <hi>that a contemplative soul tending to
God, and working almost only with the heart
and blind affections of the will, pouring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
upon God apprehended only in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
notion of faith, not enquiring what he
is, but believing him to be that incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
being which he is, and which can only
be comprehended by himself, rejecting and
striving to forget all Images and representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of him, or any thing else; yea tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending
all operations of the imagination,
and all subtlety and curiosity of reasoning,
and lastly seeking an union with God only by
the most pure and most intime affections of the
spirit, what possibility of illusion or errour
can there be to such a soul?</hi> none doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less:
for this is more than a meer <hi>sleep</hi> of
the soul, for all <hi>reasoning</hi> and <hi>images</hi> of
<hi>things</hi> being wholly laid aside, there is not
so much as a possibility of <hi>dreaming</hi> left.
The next thing he takes notice of, which is
very well observed,<note place="margin">S. 3.</note> is <hi>that men given to
sublime speculations</hi> (or I suppose any who
have the use of reason) <hi>are not so capable
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:45050:190"/>
of it as unlearned persons and Women,</hi> and
therefore <hi>Father Leander à Sancto Martino,</hi>
approves the Book <hi>as containing very sound
and wholesome doctrine for the direction of
devout souls,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probations. <hi>pag.</hi> 319.</note> 
               <hi>and fit and agreeable to our
calling and rule, and especially for the use of
our Dames;</hi> because they might more easily
swallow it, as they do pills, without chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and so find not any bitterness in it:
which is to the same purpose with that
reason <hi>Baker</hi> himself gives, viz. <hi>that the
perfection of contemplation scarcely at all lyes
in the operations of the understanding.</hi> A
most admirable way of contemplating with
the will: but why might it not consist as
well in the <hi>volition</hi> of the <hi>understanding</hi> as
in the <hi>contemplation</hi> of the <hi>Will?</hi> The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
end of this <hi>contemplative life,</hi> he addes,
<hi>is the attaining to an habitual and almost
uninterrupted perfect union with God in the
supream point of the spirit</hi> (or rather <hi>fund</hi>
as Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> more <hi>mystically</hi> calls it) <hi>and
such an union as gives the soul a fruitive pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of him and a real experimental per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of his divine presence in the depth and
center of the spirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. 6.</note> 
               <hi>which is fully possessed
and filled with him alone.</hi> And lest we
should think this were all to be hoped for
in this contemplative state, he saith fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">S. 11.</note>
               <hi>that besides this active union wherein
the soul her self concurrs, there are others
meerly passive, in which God after a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:45050:190"/>
and inconceivable manner affords them
interiour illuminations and touches, yet far
more efficacious and Divine; in all which
the soul is a meer patient and only suffers
God to work his divine pleasure in her,
being neither able to further or hinder it.
The which unions though they last but even
as it were a moment of time, yet do more
illuminate and purifie the soul, than many
years spent in active exercises of spiritual
Prayer or Mortification could do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The steps he sets down in order to this
state of perfection,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. 4. S. 11.</note> 
               <hi>are,</hi> 1. The way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
and imaginary exercises of Prayer, in
which without a discreet diligence and
constancy in them, the soul may perhaps
end her dayes therein. <hi>A sad case, to
end our dayes as</hi> Christ <hi>and his</hi> Apostles
<hi>did, who used this low dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of</hi> praying <hi>to the last! But alas, they
never understood these</hi> passive unions <hi>with</hi>
God <hi>in the</hi> fund of the spirit, <hi>they taught
men a plain and intelligible way of serving</hi>
God, <hi>and bid them look for perfection in
another world.</hi> 2. Aspirations and pure
elevations of the superiour Will. 3. <hi>The</hi>
divine inaction. 4. <hi>Then when one would
least expect them, follow,</hi> woful obscurities
and desolations: <hi>and after them; 5. Comes
the</hi> State of perfection.<note place="margin">Treat. 3. Sect. 11. cap. 1. S. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Elsewhere he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
the progress towards this</hi> State <hi>of</hi>
perfection <hi>thus,</hi> that he who would come to it
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:45050:191"/>
must practise the drawing of his external
senses inwardly to his internal, there losing
and as it were annihilating them; then he
must draw his internal senses into the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
powers of the soul: and there annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
them likewise; and those powers of the
intellectual soul he must draw into that
which is called their unity, and lastly that
Vnity which alone is capable of perfect uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with God must be applied and firmly fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on God; wherein the perfect divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
lyes. In which union, <hi>he saith,</hi>
all is vacuity or emptiness,<note place="margin">S, 15.</note> as if nothing were
existent but God and the soul; yea so far is
the soul from reflecting on her own existence,
that it seems to her, God and she are not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct,
but one only thing. <hi>This is called by
some mystick Authors the</hi> state <hi>of</hi> Nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
<hi>by others (it being indifferent it
seems among them) the</hi> state <hi>of</hi> Totality;
<hi>but the most sublime description of it, is
that</hi> of the Vnion of nothing with nothing:<note place="margin">Treat. 3. sect. 4 cap. 6.</note>
               <hi>which being hard terms to be understood
he explains them thus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. 8.</note> that the soul being
no where corporally or sensibly, is every where
spiritually and immediatly united to God this
infinite nothing. <hi>By which it is just as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible
as it was before. Nay; which I
think is the highest state of all, it is,</hi> that the
soul comes to a feeling of her not being,<note place="margin">S. 9.</note> and
by consequence of the not being of creatures;
the which is indeed a real truth: <hi>or else
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:45050:191"/>
intolerable nonsense; as we cannot think it
otherwise, who know we have cause to
thank</hi> God, <hi>we are yet in our</hi> Wits, <hi>and
are not possessed with such a</hi> Spiritual
Frenzy,<note place="margin">Treat. 3. sect. 4.</note> 
               <hi>as this</hi> Author <hi>saith,</hi> Fryer <hi>Bernard</hi>
one of the disciples of St. <hi>Francis</hi> had;<note place="margin">S. 19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>neither
was the other free from it, who as</hi> Baker
<hi>related,</hi> in the heat of his interiour affection,
could usually cry out nothing but V. V. V.
<hi>Neither can any persons who have any use
of their understandings left, think such
discourses the effect of any thing but the
height of</hi> Enthusiasm <hi>or a</hi> Religious Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
<hi>I do not think such expressions as
those I have already produced can be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleld
by the most frantick</hi> Enthusiasts <hi>that
have been since the beginning of the</hi> Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of love. <hi>Yet these Books are</hi> licensed,
approved, <hi>nay</hi> admired <hi>in the</hi> Roman Church,
<hi>whereas we have alwayes disowned, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
and condemned any such Writers
among us, and have used all care to suppress
and confute them. The plain effect of such</hi>
Enthusiastick <hi>fooleries is to make Religion
laughed at by some, despised by others, and
neglected by all, who take no other measures
of it, than from such confounded Writers.
If once an unintelligible way of practical</hi>
Religion, <hi>become the standard of</hi> devotion, <hi>no
men of sense and reason will ever set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
about it, but leave it to be</hi> understood
<hi>by</hi> mad-men <hi>and</hi> practised <hi>by</hi> Fools.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="336" facs="tcp:45050:192"/>
§. 15. <hi>But supposing this way were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible
and practicable which it is not;</hi>
               <note place="margin">The ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most effect of this way is gross En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm.</note>
               <hi>yet what would the effect of it be but the
highest</hi> Enthusiasm? <hi>For the same Author
layes it down,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Treat. 1. sect. 2. cap. 1.</note> 
               <hi>as a fundamental rule,</hi> that
God only by his holy Inspirations is the guide
and directour,<note place="margin">S. 6.</note> in an Internal contemplative
life, and that all the light they have therein
is from immediate divine illumination: as
well as our strength from the divine opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:<note place="margin">S. 7.</note>
and that this light doth extend fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and to more and other more particular
objects than the divine light or Grace, by
which good Christians living common lives in
the world are lead, extends to, yea than it
does even in those that seek perfection
by the exercises of an active life. <hi>But which
is very extraordinary in this supernatural
light, he saith</hi> that generally when there is
proposed the not doing or doing of an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
work,<note place="margin">S. 12.</note> and both of them are lawfull, the
divine inspiration moves to the not doing;
<hi>but this is not all, but among the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to</hi> divine Inspirations <hi>he reckons, not
only</hi> all external duties of Religion,<note place="margin">Cap. 5. S. 10.</note> but the
doing things meerly for Edification. <hi>A
most excellent and</hi> Apostolical <hi>doctrine! but
it is happy for the</hi> Christian <hi>world the</hi>
Apostles <hi>had other kind of</hi> Inspirations <hi>from
these: or else they had never done much
good in the World, or been such eminent
examples of holy life and actions. What
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:45050:192"/>
becomes of all the precepts they have left
us of doing good, of mutual edification,
of constant business, besides the commands
for the outward duties of Worship, if these
be the hinderances in the way to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sact. 2. c. 1. S. 14.</note>
               <hi>And although he would not have</hi> his
spiritual, internal liver to pretend to extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
apparitions, voices, conversations with
spirits, message from Heaven, <hi>&amp;c. Yet in his
Discourse of</hi> Passive Vnions,<note place="margin">Treat. 3. sect 4 cap 3.</note> 
               <hi>he saith,</hi> that
God reveals himself to the soul by a superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
species impressed in her,<note place="margin">S. 2.</note> which revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are either sensible as apparitions, words,
&amp;c. or intellectual either immediately or by
Angels; the effects of which supernatural
inactions of God are Rapts or Extasies,<note place="margin">S. 6.</note> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
visions,<note place="margin">S. 36.</note> &amp;c. in which, <hi>he saith,</hi> that the
less experienced and imperfect are to advise
with their directour about them, but those who
were more eminently perfect have followed
their own light in judging of those things and
practising accordingly, without consulting
others;<note place="margin">S. 37.</note> 
               <hi>and withall addes,</hi> that such souls
which receive these things must carefully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
her internal direction: and that they
are not so absolutely obliged to resign their
judgements and wills to others, as to neglect
their own proper call received from God. <hi>And
doth this doctrine now differ from that of
the</hi> Fanatick Sectaries <hi>which have swarmed
in</hi> England? <hi>Yes. Mr.</hi> Cressy <hi>in his Preface
undertakes at large to shew the difference:
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:45050:193"/>
by answering the objection taken from thence
against the publishing this doctrine, because
it would justifie them in all their frenzies
and disorders:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cressy<hi>'s Preface to</hi> Sancta So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia. S. 23.</note> 
               <hi>and in order to this; 1. He
very foolishly goes about to prove</hi> the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of divine Inspirations; <hi>from</hi> the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of divine Grace, for the doing good
actions; <hi>which is not denyed by the greatest
enemies to</hi> Enthusiasme.<note place="margin">S. 24.</note> 2. <hi>He saith,</hi> we
ought to correspond to those Divine Inspirations
which stirr us up to good actions, <hi>if he means
by them nothing but the assistance of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Grace,<note place="margin">S. 25.</note> no one questions it.</hi> 3. That
there may be false suggestions of the Devil,
which may appear like the motions of Gods
Spirit.<note place="margin">S. 27.</note> 4. <hi>That,</hi> it being necessary these
should be distinguished from each other; the
only means imaginable, that can be proper,
natural, and efficacious to obtain such a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
light to discern Gods will in all
things as pure spiritual prayer exercised by a
soul living an abstracted, internal, recollected
life, spent in a continual attendance on God,
&amp;c. i. e. <hi>in short, the directions of F.</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin
Baker. <hi>And is not this, think we, a
very cunning way of vindicating his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
from</hi> Fanaticism, <hi>to make</hi> Enthusiasm
<hi>necessary to</hi> distinguish the motions <hi>of the</hi>
good, <hi>and</hi> bad Spirit <hi>in our minds? I have
already shewed that he teaches the highest</hi>
Enthusiasm, <hi>and it seems those who made
the objection were sensible of it. But
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:45050:193"/>
how doth Mr.</hi> Cressy <hi>answer it? by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what they condemn, to be necessary;
and in effect that no man can know the
difference between the motions of the</hi>
Holy Ghost <hi>and the</hi> Devil, <hi>but by</hi> Enthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asme;
<hi>nay, that is the plain meaning of his
words; for this</hi> contemplative prayer, <hi>he
saith, is the only means to gain such a</hi> su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
light <hi>whereby we can distinguish
one from the other. An admirable way!
to tell men they must first be mad, before
they can know whether they be in their
wits or no. But since this</hi> contemplative
state, <hi>hath besides the common though</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
illuminations, <hi>many</hi> passive unions,
<hi>or</hi> extraordinary revelations <hi>attending it,
suppose the Question were put how one
should know whether these came from</hi> God,
<hi>or the</hi> Devil, <hi>what answer will Mr.</hi> Cressy
<hi>then give? will he return back again to try</hi>
illuminations <hi>by</hi> inspirations <hi>(as he calls
them) and so</hi> inspirations <hi>by</hi> illuminations,
<hi>which is just like the</hi> Scripture <hi>by the</hi>
Church, <hi>and the</hi> Church <hi>by</hi> Scripture?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But here,</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. 29.</note> saith Mr. <hi>Cressy, is no pretending
to new or strange revelations, no walking
in mirabilibus super se:</hi> yes I think he doth
so, when he utters these things; for what
are <hi>passive unions,</hi> but <hi>new revelations,</hi> and
as great as ever any <hi>Fanatick Sectary</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to? Did not they deliver this for their
Doctrine, that men ought to hearken to
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:45050:194"/>
the immediate impulses of the <hi>Spirit of
God</hi> within them, and that now <hi>God</hi> doth
acquaint his own people with his mind and
will in a way peculiar to themselves? And
what have they done of the <hi>mystical way,</hi>
but only changed a few terms, and asserted
the thing it self higher than our <hi>Enthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asts</hi>
did, who did not boast of so many
<hi>raptures, visions,</hi> and <hi>revelations</hi> as those of
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> have done.<note place="margin">Lud. Blosii Monile Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. p. 78.</note> 
               <hi>Lud. Blo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
in his works hath one Book called <hi>Monile
Spirituale,</hi> which consists of nothing but
the new and strange revelations which
were made to four Women Saints St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude,</hi>
St. <hi>Mathildis,</hi> St. <hi>Bridgitt,</hi> and St. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine;</hi>
and in his Preface saith, <hi>it is a
sign of a carnal mind to despise such revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as these are: for the Church of God is
wonderfully enlightned by them. What,</hi> saith
he, <hi>did not the Prophets and Apostles receive
truth from Heaven by Revelations?</hi> As
though the case were the very same in these
melancholy Women and in the holy <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi>
and <hi>Apostles:</hi> and we had just as
much reason to believe the effects of <hi>hysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
vapours</hi> and the <hi>divine Spirit.</hi> And lest
we should imagine these were only the <hi>Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
of some Women, which their Church
would not be concerned for the credit of,
he concludes with saying, <hi>that these Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
were known to the world and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>
For those of St. <hi>Bridgitt</hi> we have
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:45050:194"/>
before shewed how much they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved;
For St. <hi>Gertrudes,</hi> he saith the
same; and <hi>that one very learned and
illuminate man did say after the accurate
reading of them, that man could not have
the Spirit of God, who Questioned whether
those revelations came from it or no.</hi> And
therefore <hi>Blosius</hi> is so far from denying any
new or strange revelations among them,
that, being a devout man, <hi>he prays God to
pardon those who questioned the authority of
these revelations.</hi> But if no <hi>new revelations</hi>
are allowed among them, what means that
saying in the <hi>spiritual exercises</hi> of the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits,
p.</hi> 31, 32. of the Impression, <hi>A. D.
1574. It is the great perfection of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
to keep himself indifferent to do what
God shall reveal to him, and not to determine
himself to do what he hath already revealed
and taught in the Gospel.</hi> This is speaking
to the purpose; and lest I should seem to

I can tell him therefore of a Friend

that is for <hi>new and strange revelations</hi> too,

            <p>But supposing they have <hi>new</hi> and <hi>strange

saith, <hi>they are not seditious and troublesome

               <hi>no dissolving unity or crossing
lawful authority by them; because these are
enjoyed in solitude and retirements, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
they be mistaken, no harm would accrew
to others by it.</hi> As though persons were
ever the less mad for being chained, and
having a <hi>keeper</hi> assigned them: such in
effect do they make the office of a <hi>confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour</hi>
to these <hi>contemplatives.</hi> The mischief
to the world is not so great while they are
kept up, but that to <hi>Religion</hi> is unsufferable,
while they lead devout persons in such an
unintelligible way, that the highest degree
of their perfection is <hi>Madness.</hi> But I have
already proved at large, that they have not
been able in some cases, or willing in
others to keep up these <hi>Enthusiastical</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
among them, but they have done as
much to the disturbance of the peace, and
been as unreclaimable among them, as ever
any <hi>Fanatick Sectaries</hi> have done or been in
<hi>England.</hi> And we are not to think that
the Principles of their <hi>Church</hi> are such quiet,
meek and obedient things, that not a man

§. 16. I now come to prove that they
are as much guilty of the second sort of
<hi>Fanaticism</hi> as any <hi>Sectaries</hi> among us have
been,<note place="margin">Of their Fanaticism in resisting Authority under a pretence of Religion.</note> which is the resisting authority under
a pretence of <hi>Religion.</hi> This I shall prove
by two things. 1. That the Principles and
practices of the <hi>Iesuitical party</hi> in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church</hi> are as destructive to <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
as of the most <hi>Fanatick Sectaries</hi>
which ever have been among us. 2. That
this party is the most countenanced and
encouraged by the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That the Principles and Practices of
the <hi>Iesuitical party</hi> in the <hi>Roman Church</hi> are
as destructive to <hi>Government</hi> as of the most
<hi>Fanatick Sectaries</hi> which ever have been
among us. What effects of <hi>Fanaticism</hi>
have we seen in <hi>England</hi> so dreadful which
may not be paralled with <hi>examples,</hi> or
justified by the <hi>principles</hi> of that party? Is
it, that so many mens lives have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
under a pretence of <hi>Religion?</hi> and
do they think the <hi>Massacre</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> and the
<hi>Rebellion</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> can ever be forgotten
by us? Is it, that <hi>Government</hi> was sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by them to be so originally in the
people, that they by their <hi>representatives</hi>
may call their <hi>Soveraign</hi> to an account, and
alter the <hi>form</hi> of <hi>Government?</hi> This is the
express doctrine of the <hi>Iesuits:</hi>

<hi>Bellarmin, Civil power is immediately in the
people as the immediate subject of it: and
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:45050:196"/>
is indifferently transferred by them either to
one or many; and if they see cause may
change it as they see good from a Monarchy,

persons had published a doctrine contrary
to his,<note place="margin">Recognit. p. 56.</note> therefore in the <hi>recognition</hi> of his
<hi>works</hi> he endeavours to strengthen what he
had delivered, and produces a saying of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,
that the people never do transferr their
power so far to the King, but they retain it
habitually in themselves, and may in certain
cases resume it into their own hands.</hi>

               <hi>Iohn
Mariana,</hi> whose name will never be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
in these matters, determines the
case plainly, <hi>That if there be no hope of a
Princes amendment, the Common-wealth may
take away his Kingdom, and because that
cannot be done without War, they may raise
armies against him, and having proclaimed
the King their publick enemy may take away
his life.</hi>

               <hi>Reynolds</hi> in his Book of the <hi>just
abdication of</hi> Henry 3. <hi>of</hi> France, saith
<hi>that all the Majesty of the Kingdom is in
the assembly of the states, to whom it belongs
to bridle the Kingly power, and to settle all
things that belong to the publick Government.</hi>
This is a doctrine fitted for such a season
wherein there is hopes to prevail upon
a considerable party (as in the <hi>League</hi> in
<hi>France)</hi> to do their business, but in case
the <hi>States</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> be faithful to
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:45050:196"/>
their Prince, they have easier wayes of
dispatch. And to this end they declare it
lawful for any person to take away the
life of a <hi>Prince</hi> excommunicated by the
<hi>Pope.</hi> But here their juggling and shuffling
shew their meaning is not good, for they
who mean honestly are not afraid to speak
plainly. If any one ask them, <hi>Whether it
be lawful to kill their Soveraign?</hi> they will
tell you <hi>by no means,</hi> and that none of
them ever said so; but being excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
they do not account him <hi>their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Philopater c. edictum. Elizab. p. 149.</note>
and so they may lawfully do it.
Nay it is avowed by some of them, <hi>that
it is a point of faith to believe it is in the
Popes power to depose Heretical Princes,
and that subjects are upon their being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
heretical thereby absolved from all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of obedience to them. Nay that there
needs no sentence of the Pope to be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
against him:</hi> and <hi>Mariana</hi> makes <hi>an
intention of publick good, or, the advice of
grave men sufficient,</hi> such as the Jesuites in
<hi>France</hi> were to <hi>Clement, Chastel,</hi> and <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaillac,</hi>
the first and last the actual Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers
of <hi>Henry</hi> 3. and <hi>Henry</hi> 4. and the
second shewed his good intention when
he stabbed <hi>Henry</hi> 4. in the mouth. If any
<hi>Priest</hi> or <hi>Fryer</hi> should attempt it, they have
an excellent <hi>salvo</hi> for him, that <hi>being a
spiritual person</hi> (acording to their doctrine
of <hi>exemption) he is no Subject to the King.</hi>
               <pb n="346" facs="tcp:45050:197"/>
If the Authority of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>
be objected by them as the <hi>doctrine
of their Church</hi> against these Principles,
they have withall given us an answer, that
it meddles not with the case of <hi>Soveraign
Heretical Princes excommunicated by the
Pope.</hi> I need not produce the particular
testimonies in this matter of <hi>Bellarmin,
Suarez, Valentia, Vasquez,</hi> with the herd
of the <hi>Iesuitical</hi> order who follow these,
having been produced by so many already,
and particularly by the two worthy Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of the <hi>Answer</hi> to <hi>Philanax,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answ. to Philan. chap. 5. p. 111.</note> and

effects of <hi>Fanaticism</hi> here,<note place="margin">Answ. to Philan. p. 53. <hi>to</hi> 65.</note> in the
Murther of a most excellent Prince. To
whose observations I shall only adde this,
that <hi>A. D.</hi> 1648. a Book was Printed with
this Title <hi>Several Speeches delivered at a
Conference concerning the Power of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to proceed against their King for misgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
licensed by <hi>Gilb. Mabbot,</hi> which
is, word for word, taken out of <hi>Parsons</hi> the
<hi>Iesuites</hi> Book of succession to the <hi>Crown of
England,</hi> (purposely designed against our
<hi>Kings</hi> title) as will appear to any one who
will take the pains to compare them. By
which we may see to whom our <hi>Fanaticks</hi>
               <pb n="347" facs="tcp:45050:197"/>
owed their principles and their precedents,
and how much <hi>Father Parsons</hi> (though at
that distance) contributed to the cutting
off the <hi>Kings</hi> Head. But it may be now
they have changed their principles and
renounced all these Doctrines; we should
like them so much the better if they once
did this freely and sincerely, and not with
sly tricks and aequivocations which they
use in these matters whenever they are
pinched with them. Let them without
<hi>mental reservations</hi> declare but these two
points, that <hi>the Pope cannot absolve the
Kings Subjects from the Oath of Allegiance
they make to him,</hi> and that <hi>though the Pope
should excommunicate the King as a Heretick
and raise War against him, they are bound to
defend the King against the Pope;</hi> and by
the owning these two Propositions, they
will gain more upon our belief of their
fidelity, than the large volumn in vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Irish Remonstrance</hi> hath done;<note place="margin">Remonstr. Hibernor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>. p. 1. cap 4. S. 2.</note>
For there they falter in the very entrance;
for being charged from <hi>Rome, that by their
Remonstrance they had fallen under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
of the Bull of</hi> Paul 5. <hi>against the
Oath of Allegiance,</hi> they give these three
Answers which ought to be considered by
us. 1. <hi>That in the Oath of Allegiance they
swear and testifie in their Consciences before God
and the World, that King</hi> Charles <hi>is their
lawful King, and that the Pope hath no power
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:45050:198"/>
to depose,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Whereas they only acknowledge
it. 2. That in the Oath of Allegiance, the
contrary opinion is condemned which is not in
theirs. 3. That in the Oath of Allegiance,
they declare that they believe that the Pope
cannot dispense with that Oath or any part of
it; but this is omitted by them:</hi> and surely
not without reason on their parts, but with
little satisfaction on ours. And it is easie
to observe that this <hi>Remonstrance</hi> was
grounded upon this, <hi>that the Pope owned
our King to be lawful King of</hi> England (a
great kindness) and this being supposed all
the rest follows naturally as they well prove
against the <hi>Divines</hi> of <hi>Lovain;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Romanstr. Hib. p. 1. c. 2. art. 2. 5.</note> but suppose
it should come into his <hi>Holiness</hi>'s head, to
be of another opinion, we see no assurance
but they will be so too. And it may
make the <hi>Pope</hi> more cautious for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
how he declares himself when such ill
use is made of it; and others how they
rely upon such <hi>Remonstrances</hi> which have
still a tacit reservation of the <hi>Popes</hi> power
to declare and dispense. But will they
declare it unlawful to resist Authority
when the cause of their <hi>Church</hi> is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;<note place="margin">Caron. p. 1. c. 5. S. 24. p. 25.</note>
and supposing that thereby they can
settle the <hi>Pope</hi> in the full exercise of his
spiritual <hi>Authority</hi> among us? No, this is
their <hi>good old Cause</hi> that undermines <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments,</hi>
that <hi>Sanctifies</hi> Rebellion, and turns
<hi>Nuptials</hi> into <hi>Massacres.</hi> This is that
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:45050:198"/>
which changes <hi>blood</hi> into <hi>Holy water,</hi> and
<hi>dying</hi> for Treason into <hi>Martyrdome;</hi> this
is that which gives the glory at <hi>Rome</hi> to
<hi>Regicides,</hi> and makes the Pictures of <hi>Gue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,
Guignard</hi> and <hi>Garnet</hi> so much valued
there; of which we have a sufficient
testimony from <hi>Mons. S. Amour;</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Amour's Iournal part. 2. ch. 11. p. 58.</note> who tells
us that among the several pourtraicts of
Jesuits publickly sold there with permission
of the Superiour, he saw one of <hi>Garnet,</hi>
with this Inscription, <hi>Pater Henricus Garne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
Anglus Londini pro fide Catholicâ suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
&amp; sectus 3 Maii</hi> 1606. Father <hi>Henry
Garnet</hi> hanged and quartered at <hi>London</hi>
for the Catholick Faith: by which we see
that Treason and the Catholick faith are all
one at <hi>Rome;</hi> for nothing can be more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
than that <hi>Garnet</hi> suffered only on
the account of the <hi>Gunpowder-treason;</hi> of
which as <hi>M. S. Amour</hi> observes, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
himself guilty before he dyed.
The most dangerous Sect among us, is of
those who under pretence of setting up
the <hi>Kingdom of Christ,</hi> think it lawful to
overturn the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of the World. But
herein they have mightily the advantage
of those of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> that what
they do for <hi>Christ,</hi> the other do it only for
his <hi>Vicar:</hi> and surely if either were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
it is much fitter to do it for one, than
for the other. We are of opinion that it
is somewhat better being under <hi>Christs</hi>
               <pb n="350" facs="tcp:45050:199"/>
own Government than the <hi>Popes</hi> whatever
they think; but we condemn any <hi>opposition</hi>
to <hi>Government</hi> under any pretence whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever;
and though <hi>Venner</hi> and his company
acted to the height of <hi>Fanaticism</hi> among
our Sectaries, yet <hi>Guido Faux</hi> with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
in their Church went beyond
them.</p>
            <p>2. That party which hath been most
destructive <hi>to Civil Government,</hi> hath had
the most countenance and encouragement
from <hi>Rome.</hi> Of which I shall give but two
<hi>instances</hi> but sufficient to prove the thing,
<hi>A. D.</hi> 1594. 27 of <hi>December Iohn Chastel</hi> a
Citizens Son of <hi>Paris,</hi> and disciple of the
<hi>Iesuites,</hi> having been three years in the
School, watched his opportunity to stabb
<hi>Henry</hi> 4. but by his stooping just at the
time of the blow, he struck him only into
the mouth; upon which the <hi>Iesuits</hi> were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
<hi>France,</hi> and a <hi>Pyramid</hi> erected in their
place of his <hi>Fathers</hi> house, in the Front
whereof towards the <hi>Palace gate,</hi> the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest</hi>
of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> against the
<hi>Traitor</hi> was engraven, containing his exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
and confession of being a <hi>Scholler</hi>
of the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> a Disciple of <hi>Guerets,</hi> and
the sentence passed upon him because he
believed it lawful to <hi>Kill Kings,</hi> that
<hi>Henry</hi> 4. was not in the <hi>Church</hi> till he
was approved by the <hi>Pope,</hi> &amp;c. This <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest</hi>
continued without notice taken of it
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:45050:199"/>
at <hi>Rome,</hi> till <hi>October 9. A. D.</hi> 1609. and
on that day it was condemned by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the <hi>Inquisition</hi> and put into the
<hi>Index Expurgatorius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Index Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purg. Alex. 7. p. 205.</note> as it is at this day to be
seen. Which was a time wherein many
reports were fled abroad in many parts of
the Murther of <hi>Henry</hi> 4. and Letters came
to <hi>Paris</hi> from several places to know the
truth of it; and the consequence of this
was, that it being found how careful the
<hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> was to preserve the honour
of <hi>Regicides,</hi> it was but seven months and
twenty four dayes, before <hi>Ravaillac</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
that work which the other had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun.<note place="margin">Ioh. Launoy Epistol. par. 6. pag. 358.</note>
This observation I owe to an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
and learned <hi>Doctor</hi> of the <hi>Sorbon</hi> yet
living, who detests these practices and
doctrines, and himself lyes under the same
<hi>censure</hi> there. And the more to abuse the
world, on the same day a Book of <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana's</hi>
was suspended, which those who
look no farther than the name might ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
was the dangerous Book so much
complained of; but upon search it appears
to be a Book quite of another nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Coynes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The latter instance concerns the <hi>Irish
Remonstrance,</hi> the account of which I take
from <hi>Caron</hi> the publisher of it.<note place="margin">Remonstr. Hib. p. 1. c. 5. p. 27.</note> The <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Clergy</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> (a very few excepted)
were accused of <hi>Rebellion,</hi> for opposing
themselves to the <hi>Kings</hi> Authority, by the
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:45050:200"/>
instigation of the <hi>Popes Nuncio,</hi> after which
followed a meeting of the <hi>Popish Bishops,</hi>
where they banished the <hi>Kings Lieutenant</hi>
and took the Royal Authority upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
almost all the <hi>Clergy</hi> and a great
part of the people joyned with them: and
therefore it was necessary since the <hi>Kings</hi>
return to give him better satisfaction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
their <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and to decline the
<hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> which they must other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
have taken, some of them agree upon
this <hi>Remonstrance</hi> to present to the <hi>King,</hi> the
news of which was no sooner come to
<hi>Rome,</hi> but <hi>Cardinal Barberin</hi> sends a Letter
to the <hi>Irish Nobility</hi> 8 July A. D. 1662. <hi>to
bid them take heed of being drawn into the
ditch by those blind guides; who had subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to some propositions testifying their Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
to the King, which had been before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by the Apostolick See.</hi> After this
the <hi>Popes Nuncio</hi> at <hi>Brussels, Iuly</hi> 21. 1662.
sends them word <hi>how displeasing their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance
was at</hi> Rome,<note place="margin">Cap. 3. p. 6.</note> 
               <hi>and that after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
examination by the Cardinals and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
they found it contained Propositions al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
condemned by</hi> Paul 5. <hi>and</hi> Innocent 10.
<hi>and therefore the Pope gave him order to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
this among them, that he was so far
from approving their Remonstrance, that he
did not so much as permit it, or connive at
it, and was extremely grieved that the Irish
Nobility were drawn into it, and therefore
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:45050:200"/>
condemned it in this form, That it could not be
kept without breach of faith, according to
the Decree of</hi> Paul 5. <hi>and that it denyed the
Popes Authority in matters of faith according
to that of</hi> Innocent 10. By this very late
instance we see what little countenance they
receive from <hi>Rome</hi> who offer to give any
reasonable security to the <hi>King</hi> of their
<hi>Loyalty;</hi> and by the <hi>Popes</hi> own Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the giving of it is an injury to the
<hi>faith,</hi> and a denying his <hi>Supremacy.</hi> For
which we are to understand that <hi>A. D.
1648.</hi> when the <hi>Papists</hi> were willing to
make as good terms for themselves as they
could, and it was objected to them, that
they held Principles inconsistent with Civil
Government, viz. <hi>that the Pope can absolve
them from their obedience, that he can depose
and destroy Heretical Magistrates, that he
can dispense with all Oaths and contracts
they make with those whom they call He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks;</hi>
upon which they met together and
to save themselves from banishment resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
them in the <hi>Negative,</hi> but no sooner
was this heard at <hi>Rome,</hi> but the <hi>sacred
Congregation</hi> condemned <hi>this resolution as
heretical, and the subscribers as lyable to the
penalties against those who deny the Popes
Authority in matters of faith, upon which
they are cited to appear at</hi> Rome, <hi>and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and Prisons are there prepared for them.</hi>
The summ of it then, is, that they can give
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:45050:201"/>
no security of their Loyalty to the <hi>King</hi>
against the <hi>Popes</hi> power to depose him, and
absolve his <hi>Subjects</hi> from whatever <hi>Oaths</hi>
they make to him, or they must be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Hereticks</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> for so doing. For
this <hi>good old Cause</hi> is as much still in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
at <hi>Rome,</hi> as ever: and it is in their
power to be accounted <hi>Hereticks</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi>
or <hi>bad Subjects</hi> in their own Countrey; but
one of them they cannot avoid. So much
may suffice to shew that the most dangerous
Principles of <hi>Fanaticism</hi> either as to <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasm</hi>
or <hi>Civil Government</hi> are owned and

            <argument>
               <p>The great pretence of Vnity in the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>Rome</hi> considered. The <hi>Popes</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
the fountain of that Vnity; what
that Authority is which is challenged by
the <hi>Popes</hi> over the <hi>Christian</hi> World; the
disturbances which have happened therein
on the account of it. The first revolt of
<hi>Rome</hi> from the Empire caused by the
<hi>Popes; Baronius</hi> his Arguments answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Rebellion the foundation of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of that <hi>Church.</hi> The cause of the
strict League between the Popes and the
posterity of <hi>Charles Martel.</hi> The distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances
made by <hi>Popes</hi> in the new Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire:
Of the quarrels of <hi>Greg.</hi> 7. with
the Emperour and other Christian Princes,
upon the pretence of the Popes Authority.
More disturbances on that account in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome,
than any other matter of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Of the Schisms which have happened
in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: particularly those
after the time of <hi>Formosus,</hi> wherein his
Ordinations were nulled by his successours,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:45050:202"/>
the Popes opposition to each other in that
Age: the miserable state of that Church
then described. Of the <hi>Schisms</hi> of latter
times, by the <hi>Italick</hi> and <hi>Gallick</hi> factions,
the long continuance of them. The mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
of those <hi>Schisms</hi> on their own
principles. Of the divisions in that
Church about matters of Order and
Government. The differences between the
Bishops and the Monastick Orders about
exemptions and priviledges; the history of
that Controversie and the bad success the
<hi>Popes</hi> had in attempting to compose it. Of the
quarrel between the <hi>Regulars</hi> and <hi>Seculars</hi>
in <hi>England.</hi> The continuance of that
Controversie here and in <hi>France.</hi> The
<hi>Jesuits</hi> enmity to the Episcopal Order and
jurisdiction: the hard case of the <hi>Bishop</hi>
of <hi>Angelopolis</hi> in <hi>America.</hi> The Popes
still favour the <hi>Regulars,</hi> as much as they
dare. The <hi>Jesuits</hi> way of converting the
<hi>Chinese</hi> discovered by that <hi>Bishop.</hi> Of the
differences in matters of Doctrine in that
<hi>Church.</hi> They have no better way to
compose them than we. The <hi>Popes</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
never truly ended one Controversie
among them. Their wayes to evade the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of Popes and Councils. Their dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
are about matters of faith. The
wayes taken to excuse their own differences
will make none between them and us, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
by <hi>Sancta Clara's</hi> exposition of
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:45050:202"/>
the 39 Articles. Their disputes not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to their <hi>Schools,</hi> proved, by a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
instance about the immaculate concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
the infinite scandals, confessed by
their own Authors, to have been in their
Church about it. From all which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> can have
no advantage in point of Vnity above ours.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>2. §. 1. THE other thing objected,<note place="margin">Of the great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Unity in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> as
flowing from the promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
reading the Scriptures, is, <hi>the number
of our Sects,</hi> and <hi>the disturbances which have
been among us upon their account:</hi> whereas
among them the Government of the
Church is so ordered as to keep all <hi>in peace
and Vnity.</hi> This makes it necessary to
examine that admirable <hi>Vnity</hi> they boast
so much of; and either they mean by it,
that there hath been less <hi>disturbance</hi> in the
world before the <hi>Reformation,</hi> or no <hi>Schisms</hi>
among themselves, or no <hi>differences</hi> in the
matters of <hi>Religion.</hi> But I shall now
prove: 1. That there have never been
greater disturbances in the World than
upon the account of that <hi>Authority</hi> of the
<hi>Pope,</hi> which they look on as the <hi>Foundation</hi>
of their <hi>Vnity.</hi> 2. That there have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
great and scandalous <hi>Schisms</hi> among
themselves on the same account. 3. That
their differences in <hi>Religion</hi> both as to
matter of Order and Doctrine have been
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:45050:203"/>
as great and managed with as much ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosity
as any among us.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>disturbances</hi> in the World upon
the account of the <hi>Popes Authority:</hi> I
meddle not barely with his <hi>usurpations,</hi>
(which work is lately and largely
done,)<note place="margin">History of Romish Usurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by <hi>Hen. Foulis.</hi>
               </note> but the effects of them in these
<hi>Western Churches.</hi> For which we are to
consider what <hi>authority</hi> that is, which the
<hi>Pope</hi> challenges, and what disturbances
hath been given to the peace of <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>
by it. The <hi>Authority</hi> claimed by the
<hi>Pope,</hi> is that of being <hi>Vniversal Pastor</hi> over
the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> by vertue of which
not only spiritual direction in matters of
faith, but an actual jurisdiction over all the
members of it doth belong unto him.
<q>For otherwise they say the Government
of the <hi>Church</hi> is imperfect and insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for its end; because Princes may
easily overthrow the Unity of the Church
by favouring Hereticks, if they be not in
subjection to the <hi>Pope</hi> as to their tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
concernments, because it may happen
that they have a regard to no other but
these; if it were not therefore in the
<hi>Popes</hi> power to depose <hi>Princes</hi> and absolve
Subjects from their Alleagiance, when
they oppose the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> his
<hi>power,</hi> say they, is an insignificant title, and
cannot reach the end it was designed for.
Besides they urge, that all Princes coming
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:45050:203"/>
into the Church are to be supposed to
submit their Scepters to Christ, so as to
lose them in case they act contrary to the
<hi>Catholick Church,</hi> of which they are
made members: for <hi>whosoever doth not
hate Father and Mother,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>cannot be my
Disciple.</hi>
               </q> And what officer is there so
fit to take all <hi>Escheats</hi> and <hi>Forfeitures</hi> of
<hi>Power</hi> as Christs own Vicar upon Earth?
But to adde more strength, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> very
prettily proves it out of <hi>Pasce oves,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bell. de Pontif. R. l. 5. c. 7.</note> 
               <q>for
every <hi>Pastor</hi> must have a threefold power
to defend his flock, a power over wolves
to keep them from destroying the Sheep,
a power over the Rams that they do not
hurt them, and a power over the Sheep
to give them convenient food; now,
saith he, <hi>very subtilly,</hi> if a Prince of a
sheep should turn a Ram or a Wolf, must
not he have power to drive him away,
and to keep the people from following
him?</q> This is then the only current do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
concerning the <hi>Popes</hi> Authority in
the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> although some mince
the matter more than others do, and talk
only of an <hi>indirect power,</hi> yet they all mean
the same thing, and ascribe such power to
the <hi>Pope,</hi> whereby he may <hi>depose</hi> Princes
and absolve subjects from the duty they
owe to them. And how much in request
this Doctrine continues at <hi>Rome</hi> appears
by the Counsel given by <hi>Michael Lonigo,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:45050:204"/>
Master</hi> of the <hi>Palace,</hi> to <hi>Pope Greg.</hi> 15.<note place="margin">Consilium Greg. 15. exhibitum per Mich. Lonigum. A. D. 1623.</note>
Printed <hi>A. D.</hi> 1623. about perswading
the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Bavaria</hi> then newly made
<hi>Elector</hi> to receive a confirmation of his title
from the Pope; <q>to which end, he saith,
some skilful person ought to be imployed
to acquaint him, that the power of the
Empire was the meer issue of the
<hi>Church,</hi> and did spring from it as a Child
from the Mother, and that it was a great
sin for any <hi>Christian</hi> to call this into
Question; and consequently the <hi>Popes</hi>
power and authority to determine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the State and affairs of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi>
and this he attempts to prove by
no fewer than nineteen arguments, all of
them drawn from the former Usurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the <hi>Popes</hi> and encroachments upon
the Empire: from whence he concludes
that the <hi>Electorship</hi> could not be lawfully
taken away from one and given to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
without the <hi>Popes</hi> consent and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and that such a disposal of it was
in it self null, and of no force.</q> The same
year came forth a Book of <hi>Aphorisms</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the restoring the state of the
Church,<note place="margin">Aphorismi de statu ecclesiae re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>st aurando per Mich. Lonigum.</note> by the decree and approbation of
the <hi>Colledge</hi> of <hi>Cardinals,</hi> collected by the
same person and by him presented to the
<hi>Pope;</hi> wherein the same power of the <hi>Pope</hi>
is asserted, and that it belongs to him to
transferr the Electoral dignity from one
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:45050:204"/>
to another; and that it ought to be taken
away from the <hi>Electors</hi> of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg</hi>
for opposing his Authority, and
that to allow the <hi>Emperour</hi> authority in
these things was to rob the <hi>Apostolick</hi> See
of its due rights. By which we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
what that Authority over the
Church is, which is challenged by the <hi>Pope</hi>
as supream Pastour in order to the preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Unity of it.</p>
            <p>§. 2. We now consider what the blessed
effects of this pretended power hath been
in the Christian World;<note place="margin">Of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbances of the Christian World un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence of the Popes Authority.</note> and I doubt not
to make it appear that this very thing hath
caused more warrs and bloodshed, more
confusions and disorders, more revolts and
rebellions in <hi>Christendome,</hi> than all other
causes put together have done, since the
time it was first challenged; and this I
shall prove from their own Authors, and
such whose credit is the greatest among
them. The revolt of <hi>Rome</hi> and the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
parts from the subjection due to the
<hi>Roman Emperour,</hi> then resident at <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>
was wholly caused by the <hi>Pope.</hi> The
first <hi>Pope</hi> saith <hi>Onuphrius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Onuphr. An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

openly resist the <hi>Emperour</hi> was <hi>Constantine</hi> 1.
who opposed <hi>Philippicus</hi> in the matter of
<hi>Images,</hi> which the Emperour commanded
to be pulled down because they were
abused to <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and the <hi>Pope</hi> utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
to obey; and not only so, but set up
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:45050:205"/>
more in opposition to him in the <hi>Pertico</hi> of
St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and forbad the use of the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi>
name and title in any publick Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
or Coines. The same command was
not long after renewed by <hi>Leo</hi> 3. upon
which, saith <hi>Onuphrius, Gregory</hi> 2. then
<hi>Pope</hi> took away the small remainder of the
<hi>Roman Empire</hi> from him in <hi>Italy:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sigonius de regno Italiae. l. 3. A. D. 726.</note> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonius</hi>
more expresly, <hi>that he not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated
the Emperour, but absolved all
the people of</hi> Italy <hi>from their Alleagiance,

and rose up in opposition to their Magistrates

<hi>the Emperours Lieutenant or Exarch was
killed; at</hi> Rome, Peter <hi>the Governour had
his eyes put out, in</hi> Campania, Exhilaratus

he writ a Letter to the Emperour full of the
greatest reproaches imaginable.</hi>

               <hi>Baronius</hi> is
here very hard put to it, to Vindicate the
Pope, for he confesses the Rebellion of the
people was occasioned by the <hi>Popes</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the <hi>Emperour,</hi> and commends their zeal
for <hi>Religion</hi> in it, and acknowledgeth that
the <hi>Emperour</hi> laid all the blame on the <hi>Pope,</hi>
and that the <hi>Greek</hi> Historians, <hi>Theophanes,</hi>
and <hi>Zonaras</hi> do so too; but all this he
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:45050:205"/>
saith proceeded only from <hi>their spight against
the Roman Church and their ignorance of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
in it;</hi> but if we believe him, <hi>the Pope
rather endeavoured to keep them in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the Emperour, and when they would
have chosen another he opposed it: which he
proves from</hi> Paulus Diaconus <hi>and</hi> Anasta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius.
But what is that to the business? the
question is not, whether the <hi>Pope</hi> did not
hinder the choosing another <hi>Emperour,</hi> but
whether he did not draw the people off
from their obedience to the <hi>Emperour</hi> that
then was? And this is not only affirmed
by the <hi>Greek historians;</hi> but by those of the
Roman Church.<note place="margin">Chronicon. Sigeberti ad A. 728.</note>

the same is affirmed by <hi>Otto Frisingensis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Urspergens. Chron. ad A. 718.</note>
               <hi>Conradus Vrspergensis, Hieronymus Rubeus</hi>

enmity to the <hi>Roman Church.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hier. Rubei histor. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. l. 4. p. 190.</note> As for the
making a <hi>new Emperour,</hi> therein the Pope

               <note place="margin">Hadr. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les. Rerum Francic. lib. 25. tom. 3. p. 520.</note> for as <hi>Hadrianus Valesius</hi> well

<hi>Emperour,</hi> if he had not held a private cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency
with <hi>Charles Martel</hi> at that
time, whose honour and armes were the
greatest in these Western parts. Having
thereby strengthened his interest against
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:45050:206"/>
both the Emperour his known enemy and
the <hi>Lombards</hi> that were at best but unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

can of the places that owed subjection to

               <note place="margin">Sigon. de regno Ital. l. 3. ad A. D. 727.</note> but <hi>Sigonius</hi> saith, <hi>the
people not only cast off the Emperour, but did
swear to be faithful to the Pope,</hi> (no wonder
then he was not willing to have a new <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi>
chosen) <hi>so that at this time</hi> Rome,
<hi>and the Roman Dutchy came into the hands

               <note place="margin">Papir. Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonus de Episcop. urbis. l. 3. p. 126.</note> and therefore <hi>Papirius
Massonus</hi> deservedly makes this <hi>Pope, the

Church:</hi> which we see was laid in down-right
<hi>rebellion:</hi> and can be no otherwise
justified than by making the <hi>Pope</hi> absolute

desire, who sent several Letters and Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:45050:206"/>
to him to come into <hi>Italy</hi> to revenge
St. <hi>Peters</hi> quarrel against the <hi>Lombards</hi>

               <hi>Gregory</hi> 7. deserves
the first place; I meddle not with other
things in this life, which <hi>Cardinal Benno</hi>
hath writ, (and is very weakly suspected
by <hi>Bellarmin</hi> to have been made by some
<hi>Lutheran;</hi> it being first published by a <hi>zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous

shew, that under a pretence of advancing
his <hi>Authority</hi> he was the great <hi>Boutefeu</hi> of
<hi>Christendome.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Urspergens. Chronic. p. 226. marg.</note> It is observed by some

sought sixty two pitched Battails (ten

he may thank the <hi>Pope</hi> for so many oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
to shew his courage. For he was no
sooner well settled in his chaire, but he finds
a pretence of quarrelling with the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,</hi>

wherein he calls him, <hi>Sanctum Satanam,</hi> a

and in another Letter to himself alone,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:45050:210"/>
he saith,<note place="margin">L. 1. Epist. ad Card. Ep. 8.</note> 
               <hi>that he could not get so much as a

The poor <hi>Emperour</hi> finding so general a

money or retinue, till the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Milan</hi>
and <hi>Ravenna</hi> and <hi>Lombardy,</hi> who held
faithful to him furnished him with both.
The <hi>Pope</hi> hearing that, stops his journey
into <hi>Germany</hi> and returns to <hi>Canusium,</hi> a
strong place belonging to his dear <hi>Mathildis,</hi>
who out of great kindness never parted

him satisfaction, (unless it were to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade

encouraged <hi>Guelfo</hi> the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Bavaria</hi> in

<hi>Peace</hi> to the <hi>Christian</hi> world, the <hi>Authority</hi>

strange to any one, that hears so many

others, to find more <hi>Schisms</hi> in that <hi>Church</hi>
than in any <hi>Patriarchal Church</hi> in the

<hi>Rome</hi> had been designed <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>
and the <hi>fountain of Vnity,</hi> that it was as
necessary that <hi>Church</hi> should be freed from

are to <hi>Vnity:</hi> and the same <hi>Spirit</hi> can as

are the <hi>Schisms</hi> of it against its being the
fountain of <hi>Vnity;</hi> for how can that give
it to the whole <hi>Church</hi> which so notoriously
wanted it in it self? I shall not need to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
on the more ancient <hi>Schisms</hi> between
<hi>Cornelius</hi> and <hi>Novatianus</hi> and their parties;

were of the longest continuance in that
Church, and do most apparently discover the
<hi>divisions of it.</hi> I begin with that which first
brake forth in the time of <hi>Formosus</hi> who
was set up <hi>A. D.</hi> 821. against <hi>Sergius,</hi>
whom the faction of the <hi>Marquesse</hi> of
<hi>Tuscany</hi> would have made <hi>Pope;</hi> but the
popular faction then prevailing, <hi>Sergius</hi>
was forced to withdraw, and <hi>Formosus</hi>
with continual opposition from the other
party enjoyed the Papacy four years and six
months, not without the blood of many
of the chief Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> slain by <hi>Arnul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>
in the quarrel of <hi>Formosus.</hi> After
his death <hi>Boniface</hi> 6. intruded, saith <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
into the <hi>Papal See,</hi> but was, after fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:45050:219"/>
dayes dispossessed by <hi>Stephanus</hi> 7. who
in a Council called for that purpose, nulled
all the acts of <hi>Formosus,</hi> deprived all those
of their orders who had been ordained by
him, and made them be <hi>Re-ordained;</hi> and
not content with this, he caused his body
to be taken out of the Grave, and placed it
in the Popes Chair with the Pontifical ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
on; where after he had sufficiently
reviled him, <hi>that could not revile again,</hi> he
caused the three Fingers to be cut off, with
which he used to give Benediction and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and the body to be thrown into <hi>Tiber.</hi>

but the whole Book is now set forth from
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:45050:219"/>
ancient Manuscript by <hi>Morinus;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Morinus de Sacris Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. ordinat. par 2 p. 348.</note> by which
we understand the controversie of that
time, much better, than we could before.
Two things were chiefly objected against
<hi>Formosus</hi> his Ordinations. 1. That against
the Canons of the Church he was translated
from one See to another; being <hi>Bishop</hi> of
<hi>Porto</hi> before he was made <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
2. That having been degraded by <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.
(although restored by his successour <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus,</hi>
and absolved from his Oath) he was
not capable of conferring Orders. Against
the first of these <hi>Auxilius</hi> shews that tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation
from one See to another cannot null
Ordination, from the testimony of Pope
<hi>Anterus,</hi> the example of <hi>Greg. Nazianzen,
Perigenes, Dositheus, Reverentius, Palladius,
Alexander, Meletius,</hi> and many others.
That the <hi>Nicene Canon</hi> against <hi>translations,</hi>
was interpreted by the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon</hi>
so as not to extend to all cases, and it was
so understood by <hi>Pope Leo</hi> and <hi>Gelasius;</hi>
and however that only nulls the <hi>translation</hi>
and not the <hi>ordination.</hi> Against the second
he pleads, that supposing it not to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to remove from one <hi>Episcopal See</hi> to
another, yet the Ordination may be valid;
for <hi>Formosus</hi> was not Consecrated again
himself but only reconciled by <hi>Marinus,</hi>
that the <hi>Popes Gregory</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi> had declared
against <hi>Re-ordination</hi> as much as against
<hi>Re-baptizing,</hi> that the <hi>Canons</hi> of the <hi>Apostles</hi>
               <pb n="392" facs="tcp:45050:220"/>
had forbidden it, that the Ordinations by
<hi>Acacius</hi> were allowed by <hi>Anastasius,</hi> that
the <hi>Bonosiaci</hi> though Hereticks had their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
allowed them, that the <hi>Cathari</hi> were
admitted to the Churches Communion by
the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> only with imposition of
hands, that though <hi>Liberius</hi> fell to the
<hi>Arian</hi> Heresie, yet his Ordinations after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
were not nulled; neither those of
<hi>Vigilius</hi> although he stood excommunicated
by <hi>Silverius,</hi> and added Homicide to it:
that the nulling these Ordinations was to
say in effect, that for twenty years together
they had been without the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in <hi>Italy:</hi> that none but <hi>Hereticks</hi> could
assert these things; that if any <hi>Popes</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<hi>speak</hi> or <hi>act</hi> against the <hi>Catholick faith
or Religion,</hi> they are not to be followed in
so doing. This is the substance of the
first Book of <hi>Auxilius,</hi> which things are
more largely insisted upon in the second.
But by that Book it appears most evidently
that the Barbarous usage of the body of
<hi>Formosus</hi> was most true, it being expresly
mentioned therein and justified by him in
the Dialogue that pleads for <hi>Re-ordination.</hi>
And now saith <hi>Baronius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Baron. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. ad A D. 897. n. 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>began those most
unhoppy times of the Roman Church which
exceeded the persecutions of Heathens or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks:</hi>
but he out of his constant good
will to civil Authority lays the fault altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon the power of the <hi>Marquesses</hi>
               <pb n="393" facs="tcp:45050:220"/>
of <hi>Tuscany,</hi> who had then too great power
in <hi>Rome;</hi> but he strangely admires the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of <hi>God</hi> in keeping the <hi>Heads</hi> of the
<hi>Church</hi> from <hi>Heresie</hi> all that time. Alas
for them! they did not trouble themselves
about any <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>faith</hi> at all, but were
wholly given over to all manner of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
as himself confesseth of them; when
<hi>Theodora</hi> that <hi>Mother</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>
ruled in chief, and her daughter <hi>Marocia's</hi>
Son by <hi>Pope Sergius</hi> came to be <hi>Pope</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;<note place="margin">Platina in vit. Steph. 6.</note>
when as <hi>Platina</hi> saith <hi>it grew to be
the custome of Popes to null all that their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessours
had done.</hi> Were not these goodly
heads of the <hi>Church</hi> the mean time? and
did not they keep the <hi>Church</hi> in great <hi>Vnity</hi>
under their agreeable conduct? Methinks
the providence of <hi>God,</hi> is as much concerned
to preserve <hi>holiness</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> as <hi>faith</hi> in the
world; and were not these excellent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
for doing it! <hi>Baronius</hi> grants <hi>the
acts of</hi> Stephanus <hi>to be such as the most bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Nations could not endure to hear of,
and are too bad to be believed:</hi> and all the
following Age he calls <hi>Iron</hi> for its rust and
barrenness,<note place="margin">Ad. A. D. 900. n. 1.</note> and <hi>leaden</hi> for its badness and dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and confesseth <hi>that Monsters of impurity
then raigned in the Apostolical See, that infinite
evils sprung from thence, and horrible Tragoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and mischiefs not to be spoken of.</hi> And
yet a very <hi>Catholick faith,</hi> and the <hi>Vnity of
the Spirit in the bond of peace</hi> must be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:45050:221"/>
to be there infallibly all this while;
but if all their faith and unity be of such
a kind as was in the 10 <hi>Century</hi> in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church,</hi> I should think <hi>Baronius</hi> might
have said more in admiration of the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of <hi>God</hi> in preserving the <hi>Catholick
faith</hi> and <hi>Vnity</hi> among the <hi>Devils</hi> in Hell!
for the <hi>Scripture</hi> tells us <hi>they believe and
tremble,</hi> and our Saviour saith, <hi>that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
Kingdom cannot stand if it be divided
against it self;</hi> and these are clearer and
stronger testimonies than can be brought of
the <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>Vnity</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi>
when such horrid wickedness is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to have had Dominion in it, and
that Church was therein unlike the <hi>Devils
Kingdom</hi> that it was <hi>divided against it self:</hi>
In the very beginning of this <hi>Century</hi> Pope
<hi>Stephen</hi> is cast into Prison, and there
strangled,<note place="margin">N. 6.</note> as <hi>Baronius</hi> proves from his <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph;</hi>
and now the <hi>Roman faction</hi> prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they make one <hi>Romanus</hi> Pope, the first
and only thing he did, was to condemn all
that <hi>Stephen</hi> had done, as <hi>Platina, Onuphri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
and <hi>Ciacconius</hi> all agree; but he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
not much above four months; after
him <hi>Theodorus</hi> who held out about twenty
dayes and followed the steps of <hi>Romanus;</hi>
to him succeeded <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. (as <hi>Platina</hi> calls
him) of the same faction, who set all
<hi>Formosus</hi> his <hi>Acts</hi> to rights again, condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all that <hi>Stephen</hi> had done in a <hi>Council</hi>
               <pb n="395" facs="tcp:45050:221"/>
at <hi>Ravenna;</hi> whither he was driven by the
prevalency of the faction at <hi>Rome</hi> against
him; where in the presence of seventy four
Bishops, the Acts of the <hi>Council</hi> under <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi>
were burnt, in which the Ordinations
of <hi>Formosus</hi> were nulled; and <hi>Sergius, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictus,</hi>
and <hi>Marinus</hi> were <hi>Anathematized</hi>
for being instruments in the Acts against
<hi>Formosus.</hi> The next Pope <hi>Benedict</hi> escapes
without any thing, but a dull Epitaph; but
<hi>Leo</hi> his successour had not been above forty
days in the place, but he is cast into Prison, by
one of his servants, who is made <hi>Pope</hi> in his
place, and seven months after he is served
the same way by <hi>Sergius</hi> who now at last
recovered the <hi>Popedome,</hi> and the greatest
thing he did was to condemn <hi>Formosus</hi>
again, and all who had appeared for him:
so that now as <hi>Sigebert</hi> saith, nothing was
talked of so much as <hi>ordinations</hi> and <hi>exordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,</hi>
and <hi>superordinations;</hi> by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<hi>Acts</hi> of these <hi>Popes</hi> to one another.

               <hi>and making a Bishop of ten years of age;</hi>
but these were small faults <hi>to his Adulteries,
Sacriledge, Cruelties, drinking healths to the

for help.</hi> When these accusations were sent
to him from the <hi>Council,</hi> he only threatned
to excommunicate them all, if they chose

it implyes their believing that the power
of the Keys did depend on the worth of the

<hi>Iohn</hi> 13. being killed in the act of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
the opposite faction in <hi>Rome</hi> chose <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedict

               <note place="margin">A. 964. n: 7.</note> and pronounced them <hi>Schismaticks,

a most admirable <hi>Vnity</hi> in the Roman
Church? After <hi>Leo</hi> another <hi>Iohn</hi> is chosen

for it, by the severity of <hi>Otho</hi> against

cast into Prison by the other <hi>faction,</hi> and

deposed him and set up <hi>Sylvester</hi> 3. who got
the <hi>Popedome</hi> by <hi>Simony,</hi> and enjoyed it but
three months, when (the <hi>Tusculan faction</hi>
again prevailing) <hi>Sylvester</hi> was deposed and
<hi>Benedict</hi> restored, but finding himself hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the people he <hi>resigns</hi> to <hi>Iohn</hi> (called
<hi>Greg. 6.)</hi> or as <hi>Platina</hi> saith, some affirm;
<hi>sold it to him. Otto Frisingensis,</hi> saith, <hi>these
three sat together in the City of</hi> Rome, <hi>and
all of them led very bad lives, as he heard
himself at</hi> Rome. But <hi>Baronius</hi> will not
have <hi>Greg.</hi> 6. to be the same with <hi>Iohn</hi> one
of the <hi>Schismatical Popes,</hi> but <hi>Gratian</hi> who
by fair offers (not to be called <hi>Symony)</hi>
perswading the other three to part with
their places got the possession of the <hi>Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>
alone. <hi>Alphons. Ciacconus</hi> follows

               <hi>Ioh. Gratianus,</hi> but not one of the <hi>three
Anti-Popes</hi> sitting together; wherein nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Baronius</hi> nor he can sufficiently clear
themselves. If he were distinct there must
be five <hi>Popes</hi> at the same time; for this
<hi>Greg.</hi> 6. was deprived with the rest by a
<hi>Council</hi> called by the <hi>Emperour, Henry</hi> 3. at
<hi>Sutrium.</hi> For <hi>Baronius</hi> is very much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
in saying that the other three <hi>Popes</hi>
were all deprived two years before, for his
own Author <hi>Hermannus</hi> asserts <hi>that the
cause of the false Popes was there diligently
discussed,</hi> and <hi>Greg.</hi> 6. deprived for <hi>Simony</hi>
as <hi>Ciacconus</hi> expresly saith after other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,

him out of kindness to his name sake

there made <hi>Pope,</hi> who enjoyed it but a

possession of the Papacy again, and the
fifth time after the death of <hi>Leo</hi> 9. in whose
time a great controversie arose again about
<hi>Re-ordination, viz.</hi> of such who had been
ordained by <hi>Simoniacal persons,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<hi>Leo</hi> had determined in Council,
<hi>that upon forty dayes pennance, they might

               <note place="margin">Baron. An<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ad A. D. 1052. n. 6.</note> that this Controversie

               </gap>
into the times of <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> who caused
<hi>Benedict</hi> 10. to be deprived of the <hi>Papacy,</hi>
before he came to it himself; for he called
together the discontented Cardinals at <hi>Siena,</hi>
where they discarded <hi>Benedict</hi> and chose
<hi>Nicolaus</hi> 2. The <hi>Schisme</hi> that happened
in his own time, I have already spoken to,
which I shall therefore pass by, as likewise
the others that followed upon the oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
between the <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Emperours,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it is not to be imagined that there
could be greater divisions among men than
were upon the account of those two <hi>facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
especially after they came to be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
by the names of <hi>Guelphs</hi> and <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellines,</hi>
it being ordinary for them to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
each other whereever they met, for a
mighty demonstration of the <hi>peace</hi> and
<hi>unity</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall only now enquire, whether all
these <hi>Schisms</hi> and <hi>Factions</hi> happened among
them only on the account of the differences
between the <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Emperours;</hi> and we
shall find, that the agreement among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
was only from that external opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and when that ceased, new <hi>factions</hi>
and <hi>Schisms</hi> brake forth among them. Of
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:45050:224"/>
which <hi>Italy</hi> was so full, that the elections of
<hi>Popes</hi> became the work of years, by reason
of the heats which were among them; but
I meddle not with these factions in elections,
although they are no great indications of the
presence of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> among them. But
I shall only touch at the greatest <hi>Schism</hi> for
continuance ever they had among them, (as
their <hi>Historians</hi> reckon it) which lasted with
great animosities for fifty years together, in
which all the Princes of Christendome were
concerned, and one party condemning the
other with the greatest bitterness, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
all the acts done by the other; and
pronouncing them null and void. This
was begun upon the election of <hi>Vrban</hi> 6.
at which the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> declaring a force by
the Souldiers and people of <hi>Rome,</hi> when
they were withdrawn from thence to a
place of safety; chose another Pope, viz.
<hi>Clem.</hi> 7. who sate in <hi>France,</hi> as <hi>Vrban</hi> and
his Successours did in <hi>Rome,</hi> he made twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
seven <hi>Cardinals,</hi> and <hi>Petrus de Luna</hi> or
<hi>Benedict</hi> 13. succeeded him; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all the endeavours could be used to
suppress this <hi>Schism</hi> it still continued, and
the means for that end did rather increase
it, as the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Pisa,</hi> which instead of
two <hi>Popes</hi> made three, setting up <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
5.</hi> besides <hi>Greg.</hi> 12. and <hi>Benedict.</hi> 13.
and after him <hi>Iohn</hi> 23. was chosen at
<hi>Bononia:</hi> and although afterwards the
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:45050:225"/>
               <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance</hi> deprived <hi>Iohn</hi> 23. and
<hi>Benedict</hi> 13. and chose <hi>Martin</hi> 5. yet <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict</hi>
never yielded; and after his death, the
<hi>Cardinals</hi> that were with him chose <hi>Clem.</hi> 8.
against <hi>Martin</hi> 5. who were so far from
yielding him to be true Pope, that they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
chose to rot in Prison, as they did;
and so saith <hi>Ciacconius This Schism was ended
after fifty two years,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

One might have imagined now, when <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi>
were called for that purpose, that an
end should thereby be put to these <hi>Schisms</hi>
among them, but it was so far otherwise,
that we find another <hi>Schisme</hi> begun in that
Church not long after by the <hi>Authority</hi> of
the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Basil</hi> which chose <hi>Felix</hi> 5. in
opposition to <hi>Eugenius</hi> 4. where there was
not only <hi>Pope</hi> against <hi>Pope,</hi> but <hi>Council</hi>
against <hi>Council</hi> too, <hi>Eugenius</hi> sitting at that
time with the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Florence.</hi> In the
time of <hi>Iulius</hi> 2. we find <hi>Council</hi> against
<hi>Council</hi> again, that at <hi>Pisa,</hi> and the <hi>Lateran</hi>
at <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>me,</hi> both called <hi>General Councils,</hi> and
condemning each other. By which we see
how far the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is from being
free from dangerous <hi>Schisms</hi> in it self; and
therefore hath no cause to object them to
others. The only thing pleaded in answer
to this charge of their numerous <hi>Schisms,</hi> is,
that these were most of them Controversies
concerning <hi>elections</hi> of <hi>Popes,</hi> (which is all
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:45050:225"/>
the <hi>salvo Molanus</hi> hath for it at the end of
<hi>Onuphrius</hi> his <hi>Chronologie)</hi> but what is
that to the purpose? since the Question
was, which of them was the <hi>Head</hi> of the
<hi>Church with whom the members were to be
united?</hi> and all those who were not united
with him whom they account <hi>the true Head,</hi>
must be as much in <hi>Schism,</hi> as they who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
all subjection to the <hi>Pope.</hi> For are
not those as much in Rebellion who set up
an <hi>Vsurper</hi> against their <hi>lawful Prince;</hi> as
they who deny him to be their <hi>Prince,</hi> and
to have any authority over them, because
they look on themselves as a <hi>free State?</hi>
There can be but <hi>one</hi> lawful <hi>Head of the
Church</hi> by their own principles, and only
they are truly united to the <hi>Church,</hi> who
are in conjunction with the <hi>lawful Head,</hi>
and therefore it follows, upon their own
principles, that they must be in a <hi>State</hi> of
<hi>Schisme,</hi> who are united with any other
than the <hi>true Head.</hi> What then signifie the
boasts of <hi>Vnity</hi> in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> if
they cannot prevent the falling of their
members into such dangerous <hi>Schisms?</hi> To
what purpose is it to tell us of <hi>one Head of
the Church to whom all must submit,</hi> if there
have been several pretenders to that <hi>Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>
and the <hi>Church</hi> hath been a long time
divided, which of them was the true? Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
all their <hi>Vnity</hi> comes to this at last,
that they have an excellent <hi>Vnity</hi> among
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:45050:226"/>
them if they could all agree: And such an
<hi>Vnity</hi> may be had any where. But if all
were agreed, what need any means of
agreement by <hi>one universal Head?</hi> or what
can that <hi>universal Head</hi> signifie to making
<hi>Vnity,</hi> when his title to his <hi>Headship</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a cause of greater divisions? May not
we say upon better grounds, that taking
away the <hi>Popes</hi> authority would tend much
more to the peace of the <hi>Church,</hi> since that
hath been the cause of so great disturbances
in the world and is to this day of one of
the greatest differences between the several
parts of the <hi>Catholick Church?</hi> For as
things now stand in the <hi>Christian World,</hi>
the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is so far from being the
<hi>Fountain</hi> of <hi>Vnity,</hi> that he is much rather the
<hi>Head</hi> of <hi>Contention</hi> and the great cause of
the <hi>divisions</hi> of the <hi>Christian Church.</hi>

Neither is this any lately started contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
among them, but hath continued
ever since the prevalency of the <hi>Mendicant
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:45050:226"/>
Fryers</hi> and their pretences of exemptions
from <hi>Episcopal jurisdiction,</hi> and encroaching
upon the office of the <hi>Parochial Clergy.</hi>
For no sooner did the <hi>Fryers</hi> begin publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
under pretence of priviledges to take
upon them to Preach, <hi>without licence from
the Bishops,</hi> where they pleased, and to take
other offices of the <hi>Parochial Clergy</hi> out of
their hands, but great opposition was made
against them, by all the learned men who
were friends to the <hi>Episcopal power,</hi> and the
peace of the <hi>Church.</hi> Which being a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of concernment for us to understand, I
shall give a faithful account of it, from the
best Writers of their own Church. Assoon
as the <hi>Monastick orders</hi> were found to be
very serviceable to the <hi>Interests</hi> of the <hi>Court</hi>
of <hi>Rome,</hi> it was thought convenient to keep
them in an immediate dependence upon
the <hi>Pope</hi> in whatever Countrey they were.
From hence came the great favour of <hi>Popes</hi>
to them, and their willingness to grant them
almost what priviledges they desired, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
receiving them only from the <hi>pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi>
of the <hi>Popes power,</hi> they were obliged
to maintain and defend that from whence
they derived them. At first, when they led
a more properly <hi>Monastick life,</hi> the <hi>privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi>
granted them seem to be nothing else
but exempting them from some troubles
which were inconsistent with it, either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to their persons or the estates they
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:45050:227"/>
enjoyed. After this, they began to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of the numbers of people flocking to
their <hi>Churches</hi> as inconsistent with their
private and retired life; from hence we
first read that publick <hi>Masses</hi> by the <hi>Bishop</hi>
were forbid in <hi>Monasteries,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gregor. l. 4. Epist. 43.</note> to prevent a
concourse of people and especially of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to them. But a long time after this
they lived in subjection to the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and
meddled no more in <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> than in
<hi>Secular matters.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Carol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. M. Capitular. l. 5. n. 25.</note> So <hi>Charles M.</hi> in his <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitular,
commands them to keep within their
Monasteries, to be subject to their Bishops, and
to meddle in no Ecclesiastical matters without
the express command of the Bishop.</hi> But as
the <hi>Popes</hi> increased their authority, the
<hi>Monks</hi> inlarged their priviledges, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
exemptions from <hi>Episcopal jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
which yet was not pleasing to those
who valued the <hi>Churches</hi> peace above the
priviledges of the <hi>Monastick</hi> orders. These
exemptions are therefore highly condemned
by St. <hi>Bernard,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bernard. Epist. 42 ad Hen. Senon.</note> though a <hi>Monk</hi> himself, <hi>as

against the <hi>Abbot of Malmsbury,</hi>
who refused subjection to the <hi>Bishop</hi> of
<hi>Salisbury,</hi> and being cited by the <hi>Archbishop</hi>
               <pb n="407" facs="tcp:45050:227"/>
to appear before him for his contempt; he
declared he would be subject to none but
the <hi>Pope,</hi> and said, <hi>they were pittiful Abbots
who did not wholly exempt themselves from the
Bishops power; when they might for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
pension to the Pope obtain an absolute
exemption.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Archbishop</hi> saith,
<hi>it was time for them to complain, because this
contagion did spread it self far, and the
Abbots set themselves against their Bishops
and Metropolitans: and the Popes by indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these things, did command disobedience
and Rebellion, and arm the Children against
their Fathers;</hi> but these and many other
complaints signified nothing in the <hi>Court</hi> of
<hi>Rome</hi> as long as their profit and interest
were advanced by it. And although we
read of many affronts which the <hi>Monks</hi> put
upon the <hi>Bishops,</hi> before the time of the
<hi>Mendicant Fryers,</hi> yet their insolency grew
the highest when they took upon them to
<hi>Preach</hi> in <hi>Parochial Churches</hi> and hear Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
without the <hi>Bishops</hi> leave. Thence
the <hi>Vniversity</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> published the Book,
<hi>De periculis novissimorum temporum,</hi> which
although written by <hi>S. Amour,</hi> went
abroad in the name of all the <hi>Divines</hi> there,
as appears by the beginning of it: wherein
a Character is given of those persons, who
should make <hi>the last times so troublesome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De periculis noviss. tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porum. p. 18.</note>
               <q>they <hi>should be lovers of themselves,</hi> not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during

<pb n="408" facs="tcp:45050:228"/>

would not be in subjection to the <hi>Bishops,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cap. 2.</note>
but be set before them: and therefore
<hi>disobedient</hi> to their spiritual Fathers.
And such as these are said to <hi>creep into
houses,</hi> which the ordinary <hi>Gloss</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
of those who enter into the
houses of those who are under anothers
charge: these enter not <hi>by the door</hi> as
<hi>the Rectors</hi> of Churches do, but steal into
them like <hi>Thieves</hi> and <hi>Robbers,</hi> and <hi>lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
captive silly women,</hi> is their setting them
against the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and perswading them
to a Monastick life. These are likewise
<hi>false teachers,</hi> who though never so learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and holy, teach without being sent;
and none are duly sent, but such as are
chosen and authorised by the <hi>Church;</hi>
such as <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> are, the one
succeeding the <hi>Apostles,</hi> the other the
72 <hi>Disciples,</hi> and afterwards they deny
that the <hi>Pope</hi> himself can give any power
to others to meddle in the charge of a
<hi>Parish</hi> or in <hi>Preaching</hi> among them, but
where they are invited to it; because <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
themselves cannot otherwise act out
of their own <hi>Dioceses;</hi> and that the <hi>Pope</hi>
in this case doth injury by violating the
rights of others: and if he should go
about to destroy what the <hi>Prophets</hi> and
<hi>Apostles</hi> have taught, he would erre in
so doing. Besides, say they, if these
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:45050:228"/>
                  <hi>Praedicant Fryers</hi> have a liberty to Preach
where they please, they are all <hi>universal
Bishops;</hi> and because maintenance is due
to all who Preach, the people will be
bound to pay <hi>procurations</hi> to them, which
will be an unreasonable burden upon them.
Many other Arguments they use against
this new sort of <hi>Itinerant Preachers,</hi> and
represent the dangers that came to the
<hi>Church</hi> by them at large: wherein they
describe them as a kind of <hi>hypocritical
Sectaries,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cap. 3.</note> that abused the people under
a fair shew and pretence of <hi>Religion,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
as they say, <hi>a form of Godliness, but
denying the power of it:</hi> and that the
persecution of the <hi>Church</hi> by them would
be equal, to what it was, by <hi>Tyrants</hi> and
open <hi>Hereticks;</hi> because they are familiar
enemies, and do mischief under a shew of
kindness. And that one of the great dangers
of the Church by them would be, their
<hi>possessing Princes and people with prejudices
against the Government of the Church by
the Bishops,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cap. 4.</note> which, having done, they can
more easily lead them into errours both
against faith and a good life. That their
way of dealing is first with the <hi>women,</hi>

and by them seducing the men, <hi>as the

and when they have once seduced them,

peace and welfare.</q> All these things
which are only summarily comprehended
in that Book, are very largely insisted upon
by <hi>Gul. de Sancto Amore</hi> in another Book
entituled, <hi>Collections of Holy Scripture,</hi>
which is wholly upon this subject. The
<hi>Mendicant Fryers</hi> being thus assaulted, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to defend themselves as well as
they could, and made choice of the best
wits among them for their Champions,
such as <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> and <hi>Aquinas</hi> then
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:45050:229"/>
were, who undertook their cause; and
were fain to shelter themselves under the
<hi>plenitude of the Popes power;</hi> by which
means they were sure to have the <hi>Pope</hi> on
their side; but his <hi>Authority</hi> was here no
means of <hi>Vnity,</hi> for the controversie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
long after, and was managed with
great heat on both sides.</p>
            <p>§. 8. Upon the great complaint of the
<hi>priviledges</hi> and <hi>exemptions</hi> which the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastick
orders</hi> had obtained from the <hi>Popes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Of the insufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Popes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for ending this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie.</note>
               <hi>Clement</hi> 5. promised to have this business
discussed in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Vienna;</hi> and to
that end gave order to several learned men
to write about it, among whom particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<hi>Durandus Mimatensis</hi> writ a large dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
(not mentioned by <hi>Possevin)</hi> but
Printed <hi>A. D.</hi> 1545. <q>wherein he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades
the <hi>Pope</hi> to revoke all such exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions,
because they were contrary to the
ancient <hi>Canons</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> whereby
from the Apostles times, all places and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
whatsoever were immediately under
the jurisdiction of the <hi>Bishops;</hi> and that
the <hi>Pope</hi> neither ought, nor could change
this order of the <hi>Church.</hi> Because the
order of <hi>Bishops</hi> being appointed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<hi>Schisms</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> it could not
attain its end, if any persons were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from their jurisdiction. And if
it were in the <hi>Popes</hi> power to grant such
exemptions, it were by no means expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:45050:230"/>
to do it; because the order of the
<hi>Church</hi> would be destroyed by it, the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
contemned, and the Church divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
and if the <hi>Monastick</hi> Orders paid
no obedience to the <hi>Bishops,</hi> the people
would soon learn by their example to
disobey them too. And supposing it had
been expedient before, it could not be
so then, because though the <hi>Monastick
orders</hi> were founded in a <hi>state of poverty,</hi>
yet now those who were in them were
arrived at such a height of intolerable
pride and arrogance, that not only their
<hi>Abbots</hi> and <hi>Priors,</hi> but the <hi>Fryers</hi> thought
themselves equal to <hi>Bishops,</hi> and fit to be
preferred before other <hi>Ecclesiastical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</hi>
               </q>
Thus far <hi>Durandus:</hi> and <hi>Aegidius
Romanus</hi> at the same time writ a Book
against the <hi>Exemptions</hi> of <hi>Fryers;</hi> Against
both of them <hi>Iacobus</hi> the <hi>Abbot</hi> of the
<hi>Cistercians</hi> writt a defence of <hi>Exemptions,</hi>
which was published in <hi>Vienna</hi> in the time
of the <hi>Council.</hi> This matter was hotly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
in that <hi>Council,</hi> but the <hi>Pope</hi> would
not yield to the <hi>revocation</hi> of them: but
renews a <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Boniface</hi> 8. for qualifying
and composing the differences that had
happened to the great scandal of the <hi>Church</hi>
about them:<note place="margin">Clementin. l. 3. c. 2.</note> 
               <q>wherein he takes notice of
several <hi>Bulls</hi> before, which had taken no
effect (so excellent an instrument of peace
is the <hi>Popes Authority)</hi> and that of a
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:45050:230"/>
long time a <hi>most grievous and dangerous
discord</hi> had been between the <hi>Bishops</hi> and
<hi>Parochial Clergy</hi> on one part, and the
<hi>Preaching Fryers</hi> on the other. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Pope very wisely considering,
<hi>how full of danger, how prejudicial to the
Church,</hi> how <hi>displeasing to God so great a
discord was;</hi> and resolving wholly to
remove it for the future, by his Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
authority doth appoint and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
that the <hi>Fryers</hi> should have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to Preach in all <hi>Churches,</hi> Places, and
publick Streets at any other hour but that
wherein the <hi>Bishops</hi> did Preach, or did
command others to Preach, without a
particular license to Preach then</q>: A
greater instance of the discords which have
been in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> nor of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiency
of the <hi>Popes</hi> Authority for the
cure of them can hardly be produced than
this is. The <hi>Popes</hi> were forced to say and
unsay, and retract their own grants, to
mitigate and qualifie them and all to no
purpose, for the differences continued as
great notwithstanding them. The first
<hi>Pope</hi> who interposed in this quarrel was
<hi>Gregory</hi> 9. who upon complaint made by
the <hi>Fryers</hi> of the <hi>Bishops</hi> exercising their
<hi>jurisdiction</hi> over them in several things men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned

the <hi>Fryers</hi> openly contemn the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and

to them: by which they grew so
insolent, that they called the <hi>Parish Priests,</hi>
as <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> relates, <hi>Ideots, Dunces,
Drunkards, Blind guids;</hi> and would make
the people believe that all <hi>knowledge</hi> and
<hi>sanctity</hi> was only among them:<note place="margin">Petrus de Vineis epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol. lib. 1. ep. 37.</note> insomuch
that in <hi>Petrus de Vineis</hi> who lived in that
<hi>Age</hi> and was <hi>Chancellour</hi> to the <hi>Emperour,</hi>
we read a miserable complaint of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial
<hi>Clergy</hi> against the Fryers, <hi>viz.</hi> that
<hi>by these means they were brought under the
greatest contempt to the general scandal of
Religion; they expressing the most bitter ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
against them imaginable, reproaching
their lives, and lessening their dues so as
they were brought to nothing by it; and they
were made a laughing stock to all people;
that they took away the main of their imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from them, and drew away the People
from the Churches to the Convents, teling them
the word of God was to be heard only among
them. That they had nothing now left to do
but to pull down their Churches; in which
they had scarce any thing left besides a Bell
and an old resty Image, but these holy Fryers,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:45050:231"/>
while they had nothing, possessed all things,
and professing poverty were extreamly rich.</hi>
But <hi>Innocent</hi> 4. a little before his death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wearied by the complaints of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
and <hi>Clergy,</hi> revoked the priviledges
which he had so largely granted to the
<hi>Fryers,</hi> and confined them within certain
limits, <hi>forbidding them to draw away the
people from their Parish Churches upon Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes
and Holy-dayes, or admitting any to
pennance who had not first confessed to their
Parish-priest:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Seculum quintum Universit. Paris. p. 271.</note> but the <hi>Fryers</hi> were as far
from being pacified by this, as the <hi>Clergy</hi>
were by the former; for therein the <hi>Pope</hi>
upbraids them <hi>with violating the rights of
others, with blaspheaming Religion by such
actions, displeasing God, and drawing the
souls of the faithful to perdition:</hi> but he
dying assoon as they had notice of this
<hi>Bull,</hi> they said, it was a just judgement of
God upon him for revoking their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.
And <hi>Alexander</hi> 4. was no sooner
settled in his Chair but they procured ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Bull</hi> from him to call in that of <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
4.</hi> and immediately to suspend all
execution of it; but this did not satisfie
them, for they boasted they had killed
<hi>Pope Innocent</hi> by their <hi>Prayers,</hi> and that the
<hi>V. Mary, every time they invocated her name;
turned to her Son and said, Son hear them:</hi>
upon which <hi>Innocent</hi> was presently struck
with a <hi>Palsie</hi> and dyed; from whence arose
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:45050:232"/>
a saying in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome, from the
Fryers Letanies good Lord deliver us.</hi> This
is related as true by <hi>Bzovius, ad A. D.</hi> 1254.
but is looked on as a fable of the <hi>Fryers,</hi>
by <hi>D'attichy,</hi>

But this <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Alexander,</hi> nor all the rest
he made for their sakes could make the
<hi>Bishops</hi> and the <hi>Clergy</hi> give up their <hi>rights;</hi>
for in the time of <hi>Martin</hi> 4. the <hi>Fryers</hi>
procured another <hi>Bull</hi> for <hi>hearing Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

which the contention increased between
the <hi>Bishops</hi> and the <hi>Fryers;</hi> insomuch, that
not waiting the <hi>Popes</hi> revocation of his
grant which he was inclined to by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions
of the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Amiens,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Id. p. 462.</note> they
called a <hi>Synod</hi> of the <hi>Gallican Church</hi> at
<hi>Paris, A. D.</hi> 1284. wherein the <hi>Archbishop</hi>
of <hi>Bourges</hi> being president, declared to
them, <q>that being <hi>Pastors</hi> of the flock,
they ought to lay down their lives for
their sheep, and not to suffer the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments
were made upon them by
the <hi>Fryers;</hi> by whom all things were
brought to <hi>confusion</hi> in the <hi>Church:</hi> that
they had used all fair wayes of prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with them by the intreaties of the
<hi>King</hi> and <hi>Nobles,</hi> to forbear such intrusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
into their offices as they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
guilty of; but all to no purpose,
they still defending themselves by <hi>Papal
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:45050:232"/>
priviledges;</hi> whereas there had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<hi>Bulls</hi> to another granted at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </q>
And it was then agreed among them, that
they should maintain their <hi>own office</hi> against
the <hi>Fryers</hi> incroachments, by which the
<hi>contention</hi> increased to so great a height, that
many <hi>invectives,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Meyer. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nales Flandr. l. 10. ad A. D. 1285.</note> 
               <hi>Apologies,</hi> and <hi>libels</hi> were
published one against another, <hi>to the great
disgrace</hi> (saith <hi>Meyerus) of the whole Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Order.</hi> Upon which Pope <hi>Martin</hi>
endeavoured an accommodation by another
<hi>Bull</hi> wherein he required, <hi>that all Parishio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
should Confess to their own Parish Priest at
least once a year.</hi> But this was as far from
making peace as any before; therefore
from <hi>Boniface</hi> 8. the <hi>Fryers</hi> procured a new
<hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>priviledges,</hi> 
               <q>which absolutely nulls
all the former <hi>Bulls</hi> of restriction and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation,
and by the fulness of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical
power doth exempt them from
all manner of power or jurisdiction of
the <hi>Bishops,</hi> or any other <hi>Ecclesiastical
persons,</hi> and decrees that they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
subject to the <hi>Pope</hi> and to none
else.</q> And yet this <hi>Pope</hi> himself not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
years after, retracted this <hi>Bull,</hi> and set
forth that, which <hi>Clement</hi> 5. renewed in
order to the composing this difference,
which had now to the great demonstration
of their <hi>Vnity</hi> and the <hi>Popes Authority</hi>
continued with great violence above fifty
years: and was far from being ended by
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:45050:233"/>
this <hi>Bull;</hi> for <hi>Benedict</hi> 11. in another pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
on the same occasion,<note place="margin">Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mun. l. 5. tit. 7. c. 1.</note> saith, <hi>that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead

unity and concord, greater divisions and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbances:
and by cutting off one head of the</hi>
Hydra, <hi>seven more came into its room.</hi> Are
not the Popes great <hi>Peace-makers</hi> the mean
while! Therefore he resolves to try what
the other way would do, and again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges
the priviledges of the <hi>Fryers,</hi> which
being sound as unsuccessful as ever; <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
5.</hi> resumes the <hi>Constitution</hi> of <hi>Boniface</hi>
which this <hi>Pope</hi> condemned, and to as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
purpose as the other had done before.
And now let us soberly consider whether
there hath not alwayes been an <hi>admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Vnity</hi> in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> or if di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
have arose, a ready means to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
them? Here we have the <hi>Popes</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing,
by <hi>Bull</hi> after <hi>Bull,</hi> and so far from
ending the differences that occasioned them,
that they begot more, which made the <hi>Popes</hi>
contradict one another, nay the same <hi>Pope</hi>
to contradict himself, and so the differences
became greater than they were at first.
And after all these <hi>Bulls</hi> we find the very
same Controversie at as great a height in
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> as ever it had been in
<hi>France</hi> or <hi>Germany;</hi>

wherein he declared his mind
against them, both as to their Order and
Priviledges; in which he followed the
doctrine of the <hi>Divines</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> above an

upon the like occasion, asserting it not
to be in the Popes power to grant such
priviledges which destroy the rights of

the same arguments against them, which

<hi>Wickliffe</hi> and his Disciples carrying the
Controversies much farther to points of
doctrine and other practices in the <hi>Roman

out of opposition to these whom they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on as their common enemies. It may be
therefore they will say, <hi>that although the
Popes Pastoral power may not alwayes cure
their divisions, yet the opposition of Hereticks
makes them run together like a flock of sheep;</hi>
if this were true, it seems they are more
beholding to <hi>Hereticks</hi> for their <hi>Vnity,</hi> than
to the <hi>Popes Authority:</hi> but we shall find

that neither one nor the other of these, nor

their <hi>Protector.</hi> Who being governed by
the <hi>Iesuits</hi> pitched upon a person wholly at
their devotion (as the <hi>seculars</hi> thought)
which was <hi>Blackwell</hi> a man swayed altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by <hi>Garnet</hi> Provincial of the <hi>Iesuits;</hi>
(well known for his zeal in the <hi>Catholick
cause</hi> by suffering as one of their <hi>Martyrs</hi>
in the <hi>Gunpowder Treason)</hi> and one of the
<hi>Arch-Priests</hi> instructions was, <hi>in all matters
of moment to be advised by the Provincial of
the Iesuits.</hi> The <hi>Secular Priests</hi> finding
themselves thus over-reached by the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> and that they designed
hereby wholly to govern their affairs, make
many demurrs to his Authority, both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the manner and the substance of
it: and desire a <hi>Breve</hi> from the <hi>Pope,</hi> and
then promise to submit. <hi>Parsons</hi> procures
one to their purpose, and an appearance of
peace was for a little time among them,
and they mutually promised not to charge
the <hi>Schism</hi> upon each other; but within a
month or six weeks, the flame brake out
with greater fury than ever; the <hi>Arch-Priest</hi>
sending his directions into all parts,
<hi>that none of the Seculars should be admitted
to the Sacraments without acknowledging
themselves Schismaticks.</hi> So that the <hi>Popes
Breve</hi> was so far from ending the difference,
that it encreased it; <hi>Fa. Parsons</hi> charging
them, (and the <hi>Seculars</hi> not denying it)
that after it they were farther from obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:45050:236"/>
the <hi>Arch-Priest</hi> than they were before.
So unhappy have the <hi>Popes</hi> been, when they
have gone about to use their <hi>Authority</hi> for
composing differences, among those who
are in their own <hi>Church?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we leave this and come to a later
controversie among them, about the same
matters of Order and Government. <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
Smith</hi> titular <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> was
invested with the Authority of <hi>Ordinary</hi>
over their <hi>English Clergy</hi> by <hi>Vrban 8.
Febr. 4. A. D.</hi> 1625. not long after he comes
into <hi>England,</hi> and was received with so
great kindness by their party here, as made
the <hi>Iesuits</hi> (who are friends to none but
themselves) soon to become his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
especially when he began to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
his <hi>Episcopal jurisdiction</hi> here in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>restraints</hi> upon the <hi>Regulars;</hi> which
the <hi>Iesuits</hi> with other <hi>Regulars</hi> grew so
impatient of, that they soon revived the
old quarrel concerning the <hi>authority</hi> and
<hi>jurisdiction</hi> of <hi>Bishops,</hi> and managed it
with so great heat and fierceness, that the
titular <hi>Bishop</hi> was fain to leave the field
and withdraw into <hi>France.</hi> The bottom
of the quarrel was, they found the kindness
of their party to them abated since the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
coming, who before had sway'd all,
and lived in great plenty and bravery,
when <hi>the poor Seculars got scarce bread to
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:45050:236"/>
eate,</hi> as <hi>Watson</hi> very sadly laments in his
answer to <hi>Parsons;</hi> but now the necessary
support of the dignity of a <hi>Bishop,</hi> made
the charity of their party run in another
channel, which the <hi>Provincial</hi> of the <hi>Iesuits</hi>
complains of in a Letter to the <hi>Bishop</hi> of
<hi>Chalcedon.</hi> Therefore they endeavour all
they can to make a party against him,
among the people too; which they did so
effectually, as amounted to his withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
(a more civil word for his exile.)
And now both parties being sufficiently
heated, the battel begins, in which not only
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> but <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>Flanders</hi> were deeply engaged. The first
who appeared was Dr. <hi>Kellison,</hi> Professour
of <hi>Doway,</hi> in a Book in <hi>Vindication of the
Bishops Authority,</hi> to whom <hi>Knot</hi> then <hi>Vice-Provincial</hi>
of the <hi>Iesuits</hi> returned his <hi>Modest
and brief discussion,</hi> &amp;c. under the name of
<hi>Nicholas Smith</hi> a <hi>Iesuite</hi> then dead. Soon
after came out another written to the same
purpose under the name of <hi>Daniel</hi> of <hi>Iesu,</hi>
whose true name was <hi>Iohn Fluide</hi> (which
the other, writing <hi>Ioanes</hi> for <hi>Iohn,</hi> was
the <hi>Anagram</hi> of,) he was a <hi>Iesuit</hi> too, and
<hi>Professour</hi> at St. <hi>Omars:</hi> which Books were
first censured by the <hi>Arch-bishop</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi>
then by the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> and at last by the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
of <hi>France</hi> in an <hi>Assembly</hi> of them at
<hi>Paris:</hi> but the <hi>Iesuits</hi> were so far from
giving over by this, that they new set forth
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:45050:237"/>
their Books in <hi>Latin</hi> with large approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of them; and publish a <hi>Remonstrance</hi>
against the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> in the name
of the <hi>Catholick party in England,</hi> which
was disowned by the greatest number of
them, and cast wholly upon the <hi>Iesuits:</hi> the
same year, 1631. three Books were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
by the <hi>secular Clergy</hi> here in oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the <hi>Iesuits.</hi> Who were so far from
quitting the Field by the number of their
enemies, that they begin a fresh charge
against both the <hi>Sorbonne Doctors</hi> and the
<hi>French Clergy,</hi> under the fained name of
<hi>Hermannus Loemelius,</hi> whose chief Author
was the fore-named <hi>Iesuite Lloyd</hi> with the
assistance of his Brethren, as the diversity
of the style shews: and another Book came
out against the <hi>Faculty</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> in <hi>Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of <hi>Knot</hi> or <hi>Nicholas Smith,</hi> with many
approbations of <hi>Bishops, Vniversities,</hi> and
<hi>private Doctors:</hi> and in Vindication of the
<hi>Propositions</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> (likewise censured
at <hi>Paris)</hi> another Book came forth, under
the name of <hi>Edmundus Vrsulanus,</hi> whose
true name was <hi>Mac-mahone, Prior</hi> of the
<hi>Franciscan Convent</hi> in <hi>Lovain</hi> About the
same time the <hi>Iesuits</hi> published their <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi>
of the <hi>Apostolical Creed</hi> in imitation of
the <hi>censures</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> against their Doctrine
(as though their <hi>Doctrines</hi> were as certain
as that, and themselves as <hi>infallible</hi> as the
<hi>Apostles:)</hi> wherein they charge the <hi>Bishops</hi>
               <pb n="427" facs="tcp:45050:237"/>
their enemies with reviving old Heresies
and broaching new ones. The <hi>Iesuits</hi>
having now done such great things, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
unreasonably in all places, as having
utterly overthrown their enemies, and
beaten them out of the field: when in a
little time after <hi>Hallier</hi> and <hi>le Maistre</hi> two
Doctors of the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> undertake the
quarrel against them; but none was so
highly magnified and infinitely applauded
by the <hi>French Clergy</hi> as a person under the
disguised name of <hi>Petrus Aurelius,</hi> whose
atchievements in this kind they celebrate
next to those of the <hi>Pucelle d' Orleans,</hi> and
Printed all his Works together at their own
charge: and writ a high <hi>Elogium</hi> of him
which is prefixed before them. And the
<hi>secular Clergy</hi> of <hi>England</hi> sent him a letter
of Congratulation for his Triumphs, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by <hi>Iohn Colleton Dean</hi> of the <hi>Chapter,</hi>
and <hi>Edmond Dutton Secretary,</hi> wherein they
sadly lament the discords that have been
among them here, and the <hi>Heresies</hi> broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by their Adversaries by occasion of
them. The main of-this Controversie did
concern the <hi>dignity, necessity,</hi> and <hi>jurisdiction</hi>
of the <hi>Episcopal Order,</hi> as appears by the
Censures of the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and by
<hi>Aurelius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Petri Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relii opera tom. 1. p. 62.</note> who saith, <q>that although the
Dispute began upon occasion of the <hi>Bishop</hi>
of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and the English Clergy,
yet it was now carried farther, whether
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:45050:238"/>
the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Order was necessary to the
<hi>Being</hi> of a particular <hi>Church?</hi> Whether
it was by <hi>divine right</hi> or no? Whether
confirmation might be given without <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops?</hi>
Whether the <hi>Episcopal Order</hi> was
more perfect than the <hi>Monastical?</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Regulars</hi> were under the juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of <hi>Bishops?</hi>
               </q> And therefore the
<hi>Iesuits</hi> are charged by their <hi>Adversaries</hi>
with a design to extirpate and ruine the
whole <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Episcopacy.</hi> Have not these
men now great reason to insult over us,
that some of these questions have caused
great differences among us, when the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits</hi>
in <hi>England</hi> had laid the foundation of
them by their <hi>quarrels</hi> of the same kind
but a little before, and furnished the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to <hi>Episcopacy</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>England</hi> with so many arguments to their
hands to manage their bad cause with?
But what becomes of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> all
this while? do the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Cardinals</hi> only
stand still to see what the issue of the Battel
will be, without ever offering to compose
the difference between the two parties?
No. The <hi>Iesuits</hi> finding how hard they
were put to it, make their <hi>address</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi>
as their greatest <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> and <hi>A. D.</hi> 1633.
obtained a <hi>Decree</hi> of the <hi>Sacred Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
for suppressing the Books on both
sides, without judging any thing at all of
the merits of the cause, or giving any
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:45050:238"/>
               <hi>censure</hi> of the <hi>authority</hi> on either side? And
is not now the <hi>Popes</hi> authority an excellent
remedy for all <hi>divisions</hi> in the <hi>Church?</hi>
When in so great a heat as this was, the
<hi>Pope</hi> durst not interpose at all in the main
business, for fear of losing either side;
which is a plain argument that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
look on his Authority as so preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
a thing, that they must by no means
expose it, where it is like to be called in
<hi>Question.</hi> Were not here <hi>Controversies</hi> fit
to be determined? To what purpose is
that authority, that dare not be exercised
when there is most need of it? and when
could there be greater need than in such
a time when the <hi>Church</hi> was in a flame by
these contentions? And yet so timerous a
<hi>Decree</hi> as this was, could find no acceptance.
For at <hi>Paris</hi> immediately comes out a <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition</hi>
upon it, <q>shewing the unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of it in suppressing Books with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
enquiring into the merits of the cause,
in a matter of so great consequence as
that was, that this would give great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of triumph to the Hereticks, when
such scandalous and seditious Books as
those of the Jesuits are, meet with the
same favour at <hi>Rome</hi> with the censure
of the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>France:</hi> that their <hi>profane</hi>
and <hi>Atheistical Censure</hi> of the <hi>Apostles
Creed</hi> must have no mark of disgrace put
upon it: nor such sayings of theirs
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:45050:239"/>
wherein they call the Bishops and <hi>Divines</hi>
of <hi>France</hi> by most contumelious names,
and say they are the enemies of the truth
and piety.</q> The <hi>Iesuits</hi> instead of defending
themselves against <hi>Aurelius,</hi> write a pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
defence of this Decree of suppressing
the Books on both sides; and so all the
means which the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> durst use
to extinguish this flame proved, but an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of adding to it. And whether this
Controversie be yet at an end among them,
let all the heats in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> of late
years concerning the <hi>Iesuits</hi> give testimony.</p>
            <p>§. 10. I shall not now insist any longer
upon them,<note place="margin">Of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to Bishops and their Authority.</note> but only produce some late
passages of things (which though they
happened at a greater distance, are yet suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
attested) to shew what spight the
<hi>Iesuitical Order</hi> bears to the <hi>Authority</hi> of
<hi>Bishops,</hi> what arts they have used to ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
it, what power to affront their persons,
and expose them to all the contempt that
may be when they go about to stop their
proceedings, or exercise any jurisdiction
over them. The great occasion of the
Controversie between the <hi>Bishops</hi> and
them was, that the <hi>Iesuits</hi> took upon them
to Preach, and hear Confessions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any permission from the <hi>Bishop</hi> of the
<hi>Diocese.</hi> So they did in the <hi>Philippine
Islands,</hi> whereupon the <hi>Arch-bishop</hi> of
<hi>Manille, Don Hernando Guerrero</hi> called a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:45050:239"/>
wherein it was resolved that the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
ought to bring the <hi>Iesuits</hi> to account
for what they did, which he did,<note place="margin">Moral pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Jesuits. <hi>p.</hi> 328.</note> and all
the satisfaction he could get from them
was, <hi>that they had priviledges;</hi> the <hi>Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
not satisfied with this, proceeds against
them; they name a <hi>Conservator</hi> an enemy
of the <hi>Arch-bishops,</hi> (For the <hi>Popes</hi> to keep
the <hi>Bishops</hi> in awe, have allowed them by a
<hi>Bull</hi> for that purpose,<note place="margin">Bull. Rom. Tom. 2. p. 361. Bull. 1. Greg. 13.</note> liberty in case of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

a <hi>Conservator</hi> to defend their priviledges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

the <hi>Arch-bishop,</hi> and the <hi>Iesuits</hi> procure the
Governour to joyne with him, who without
giving leave to him to make his Defence
resolve to banish him. The <hi>Arch-bishop</hi>
understanding their resolution to send him
away, goes with the <hi>Clergy</hi> about him into
his <hi>Chappel,</hi> and there to secure himself
from the insolency of the <hi>Souldiers</hi> in his
<hi>Pontifical habit,</hi> holds the <hi>Eucharist</hi> in his
hand: notwithstanding which they came
and dragged out all the <hi>Fryers</hi> who took
the <hi>Arch-bishops</hi> part, and afterwards the
old <hi>Arch-bishop</hi> himself, who fell down in
the crowd with the <hi>Pix</hi> in his hand and
wounded himself in the face. Such exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitances
made that impression on one of
the Souldiers that he drew his Sword, and
falling upon it said, <hi>He had rather dye by
his own hands than see such enormities
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:45050:240"/>
among Christians.</hi> At last the Arch-bishop
was forced to let go his <hi>Pix,</hi> and was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
carryed away out of the City, and
put into a little pittiful Barque unprovided
of all things, without permitting any food
to be given him or any of his servants to
accompany him; and was conveyed by
five Souldiers into a Desart <hi>Island,</hi> where he
had not so much as a <hi>Cabin</hi> for shelter;
and there he was kept till he yielded to
their terms. O the admirable unity,
peace, and submission to <hi>Bishops</hi> in the
<hi>Roman Church!</hi> But we have yet a more
remarkable instance of this kind, in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
case of the difference between the
<hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Angelopolis</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> and the
<hi>Iesuits;</hi> which was heard at <hi>Rome,</hi> and
several <hi>Bulls</hi> published by <hi>Innocent</hi> 10. in it.
I shall give an account of it from the <hi>Popes
Bulls,</hi> and from the letter which the <hi>Bishop</hi>
himself sent to the <hi>Pope</hi> about it, <hi>A. D.</hi>
1649. which is extant in the <hi>Collection</hi> of
the end of <hi>Mr. S. Amours Iournal,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Collection of <hi>Tract. p.</hi> 11.</note> which
he had from <hi>Cosimo Ricciardi</hi> Sub-library<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper
of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> who received it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
from the <hi>Bishops Agent.</hi> The
controversie began there upon the very
same grounds, which it had done in the
<hi>Philippine Islands,</hi> for the <hi>Iesuits</hi> would
acknowledge no subjection at all to the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,</hi>
but would Preach and hear Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
without any license from the <hi>Bishop,</hi>
               <pb n="433" facs="tcp:45050:240"/>
which difference grew so high, that the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits</hi>
chose <hi>Conservators</hi> against the <hi>Bishops</hi>
authority; as the <hi>Popes Bull</hi> granted,
<hi>May 14. A. D.</hi> 1648. doth declare; and
not only so, but these <hi>Conservators</hi> very
fairly excommunicated the <hi>Bishop</hi> and his
<hi>Vicar General:</hi> upon this the <hi>Bishop</hi> sends
an <hi>Agent</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Iesuits</hi> appear in
behalf of their <hi>Society;</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> commits
the cause to a particular Congregation of
<hi>Cardinals</hi> and <hi>Bishops,</hi> who upon the hearing
of both sides give sentence in favour of
the <hi>Bishop, Apr. 16. A. D.</hi> 1648. But the
<hi>Iesuits</hi> (as appears by the <hi>Bishops</hi> letter
bearing date, <hi>Ian. 8. A. D.</hi> 1649.) were
resolved not to wait for the <hi>Popes</hi> resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but finding that the people contemned
their censures and adhered to the <hi>Bishop,</hi>
were so enraged at it, that they resolved to
imprison him: to that end they bribe the
<hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spains Vice-roy,</hi> the <hi>Bishops</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
enemy, with a great summ of money;
and by that means clapt up most of his
Friends, and threatned them with worse,
if they would not obey the <hi>Conservators;</hi>
the <hi>Bishop</hi> himself they had appointed Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
to seize upon on <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> day,
(the better day, the better deed) who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
their minds, sent commissioners
to treat with them to prevent the <hi>tumults</hi>
and <hi>disorders</hi> were like to follow on these
differences; but they used them with
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:45050:241"/>
contempt and would hear of no terms,
unless the <hi>Bishop</hi> would submit himself and
his jurisdiction to them and their <hi>Conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vators,</hi>
but instead of peace they proceed to
more open acts of hostility, by imprisoning
his <hi>Vicar General,</hi> and using all manner of
insolencies among the <hi>People,</hi> who joyned
with the <hi>Bishop</hi> to defend him against
them. The good <hi>Bishop</hi> seeing things in
so bad a posture, thought it his greatest pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to withdraw to the mountains,
thinking himself safer among the <hi>Serpents</hi>
and <hi>Scorpions</hi> there, than in the City among
the <hi>Iesuits.</hi> There he continues for
twenty dayes, almost famished, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
for four months lay hid in a pittiful
Cottage, the <hi>Iesuits</hi> in the mean time offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
great summs of money to those who
should bring him alive or dead. But not
finding him, they bring the excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
<hi>Conservators</hi> with great pomp into
the <hi>City,</hi> and erect a <hi>Tribunal</hi> or, in the
language of the late times, a <hi>High<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>Court</hi>
of <hi>Iustice</hi> among them, where according to
their pleasure they fine, banish, imprison as
many as they thought their enemies; and
there solemnly declare what mighty injury
the <hi>Bishop</hi> had done the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding
them to Preach without <hi>licenses</hi>
from him, or till such time as they produced
those which they had from his predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours:
then they declare the <hi>Bishops See</hi>
               <pb n="435" facs="tcp:45050:241"/>
to be vacant; and caused it to be published
in the <hi>Churches,</hi> that the <hi>Iesuits</hi> did not
need any license from the <hi>Bishop,</hi> they null
all censures against them, recall all Orders
published by the <hi>Bishop</hi> for the good <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
of his <hi>Diocese.</hi> The <hi>Bishop</hi> in the
mean time privately sends monitory <hi>letters</hi>
to the people, to bear the present persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with patience, but by no means to asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate
with, or to hear those excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
persons, who had offered such affronts
to his authority and jurisdiction; by which
means, the people not being prevailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they with a great summ of money pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
some secular <hi>Iudges</hi> to forme a judicial
process against the <hi>Bishop</hi> for <hi>Sedition,</hi> to
which end they suborn witnesses against
him, but could make evidence of nothing
tending to sedition but forbidding the
<hi>Iesuits</hi> to Preach. This not taking, they
attempt another way to expose him to
contempt, upon the Sacred day of their
holy <hi>Father Ignatius,</hi> they put their Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
in <hi>Mascarade,</hi> and so personating the
<hi>Bishop</hi> and his <hi>Clergy,</hi> they make a processi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
through the <hi>Town</hi> in the <hi>middle</hi> of the
<hi>day,</hi> and sung the <hi>Pater noster</hi> and <hi>Ave
Maria</hi> as they went, with horrible blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
perverting both of them to the abuse
of the <hi>Bishop</hi> and his <hi>party,</hi> instead of say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>libera nos à malo,</hi> they said <hi>libera nos à
Palafox,</hi> which was the name of the <hi>Bishop:</hi>
               <pb n="436" facs="tcp:45050:242"/>
and others had the <hi>Episcopal staffe</hi> hanging
at a Horses taile, and the <hi>Miter</hi> on their
stirrups, to let them see how much they had
it under their <hi>feet:</hi> others sung <hi>Lampoons</hi>
against the <hi>Bishop,</hi> others did such things
which are not fit to be repeated: Which
were parts of this glorious triumph of the
<hi>Iesuits</hi> over the <hi>Bishop</hi> and his <hi>Authority.</hi>
But in the midst of this excessive jollity, the
<hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spains Navy</hi> arrived, wherein the
<hi>Kings</hi> commands were brought for remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Vice-Roy,</hi> who was the great Friend
of the <hi>Iesuits;</hi> the news of this, abated
their heat, and the <hi>Bishop</hi> secretly conveys
himself into his <hi>Palace,</hi> which the people
hearing of, ran with incredible numbers to
embrace him, for several dayes together;
upon which the <hi>Iesuits</hi> complain to the
old <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> of a sedition, and obtained
from him a command to the <hi>Chapter</hi> not to
yield to the <hi>Bishops</hi> jurisdiction; which
caused a great division among them, one part
adhering to the <hi>Bishop,</hi> and another to the
<hi>Iesuits;</hi> The <hi>Bishop</hi> therefore seeing the
differences to rise higher, and the <hi>Schism</hi> to
be greater, and the miserable condition the
<hi>Church</hi> was in among them; was fain to
submit and promise to innovate nothing,
but to wait the <hi>Popes</hi> decision. Not long
after, another Ship arrived from <hi>Spain,</hi>
with an <hi>Express</hi> from the <hi>King,</hi> wherein
the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> was commanded immediately
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:45050:242"/>
to surrender his <hi>Government,</hi> and was se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
rebuked for assisting the <hi>Iesuits</hi>
against the <hi>Bishop,</hi> and all the acts in that
matter were nulled by the <hi>Kings</hi> authority;
but the <hi>Iesuits</hi> according to their usual
integrity, gave out just the contrary to the
Orders received, and framed letters on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
which they dispersed among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
But these arts never holding long,
when the <hi>Vice-Roy's</hi> Successour was esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,
the truth brake forth; and the
<hi>Bishop</hi> returned to the exercise of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<hi>Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But notwithstanding the <hi>Kings</hi> declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the <hi>Popes Breve</hi> was now publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
among them, the <hi>Iesuits</hi> persisted still
in their obstinate disobedience; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
excommunicated by the <hi>Bishop,</hi> yet
continued to Preach and act as before.
And hereby we have a plain discovery
what a mighty regard the <hi>Iesuits</hi> have to
the <hi>Papal See,</hi> if it once oppose their <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes;</hi>
and what an effectual instrument
of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Vnity</hi> the <hi>Popes</hi> Authority is;
for they presently found wayes enough to
decline the force of the <hi>Popes Bull.</hi> For,
(1.) They said, it could have no force
there, because it was not received by the
<hi>Council</hi> of the <hi>Indies,</hi> it seems, <hi>pasce oves,</hi>
and <hi>dabo tibi claves,</hi> &amp;c. signifie nothing in
the <hi>Indies,</hi> unless the <hi>Kings Council</hi> pleases,
or rather, unless the <hi>Iesuits</hi> please to let it
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:45050:243"/>
do so. (2.) They pleaded bravely for
themselves, that the <hi>priviledges</hi> granted
them by the <hi>Popes</hi> were in consideration of
their merits, and so were of the nature of
<hi>contracts</hi> and <hi>Covenants;</hi> and therefore
could not be revoked by the <hi>Pope.</hi> (3.) That
the <hi>Popes constitutions</hi> in this matter were
not received by the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> which
are not received are no <hi>Laws:</hi> But as the
Bishop well urges against them, if these
wayes of interpreting the <hi>Popes Bulls</hi> be
allowed, his <hi>Authority</hi> will signifie nothing,
and all his <hi>Constitutions</hi> shall have no more
force than those against whom they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
be pleased to yield to them; and it
will be impossible to preserve peace in the
<hi>Church,</hi> if it shall be in the power of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to declare whether the <hi>Laws</hi> against
them are to be received for <hi>Laws</hi> or no.
<hi>But this,</hi> saith he, <hi>is the inspiration and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination
of the Iesuits, and their method
of interpreting the Papal constitutions;</hi> which
he heard very often from their own mouths
in the frequent conferences he had with
them about these matters; But they had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way to decline the <hi>Kings Authority,</hi> for
the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Council</hi> being all <hi>Lay-men,</hi>
they had nothing to do in <hi>Ecclesiastical
matters.</hi> By which means (as the <hi>Bishop</hi>
saith,) they make themselves superiour
both to <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Pope,</hi> and free from all
jurisdiction either <hi>spiritual</hi> or <hi>temporal.</hi>
               <pb n="439" facs="tcp:45050:243"/>
And I dare appeal to the most indifferent
person, whether any Doctrine broached by
the greatest <hi>Fanaticks</hi> among us, ever tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more to the dissolution of <hi>Government,</hi>
the countenancing sedition, the perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
<hi>Schisms</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> than these of
the <hi>Iesuits</hi> do? And therefore the <hi>Bishop</hi>
saith, <hi>that he had rather lay down his life,
than by yielding up his jurisdiction expose
his Authority to Contempt, and the Church
to the continual danger of Schisms;</hi> and by
many weighty arguments perswades the
<hi>Pope,</hi> if he truly designed the peace and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
of the <hi>Church,</hi> speedily and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to reform the whole <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits;
without which,</hi> he saith, <hi>it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
especially in those remoter parts, for the
Bishops to preserve any Authority.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
other corruptions among them, he
tells strange stories of their wayes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating
<hi>Christian Religion</hi> in <hi>China,</hi> and
other neighbour Nations; which they
boast so much of at this distance; but, he
saith, they who are so much nearer and
understand those things better, have cause
to lament the infinite scandals which they
give to the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> in doing it.
The account which he gives of these
things, this <hi>Bishop</hi> protests he sends to the
<hi>Pope,</hi> only to clear his own Conscience,
that he might not be condemned at the
day of judgement for concealing that
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:45050:244"/>
which he so certainly knew to be true
by those who were eye-witnesses of it.
Their first work is, to hinder all persons
of any other <hi>Order</hi> whatsoever from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
among them; and if they do come
by one means or other, they are sure to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
their banishment and persecution;
to this end, they assist and counsel the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels</hi>
themselves in it, and make use of
their hands to whip and imprison them,
and so to make them weary of being there.
When they are left alone, they have the
liberty of telling their own <hi>stories,</hi> and no
one can disprove them; but they were not
so watchful, but some of the other <hi>Orders</hi>
were sent as <hi>Spyes</hi> upon them, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they knew, they hazarded their
lives in it, yet they made full discovery
of the <hi>Iesuits</hi> way of converting <hi>Infidels.</hi>
And they discovered such horrible things
in the <hi>Catechisms</hi> they gave to their new
<hi>Converts,</hi> that they complained to the <hi>Pope</hi>
of them, but, as appears by the event,
to very little purpose<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

A.D. 1645 in <hi>seventeen Decrees</hi> condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, yet the <hi>Rector</hi> of the <hi>Iesuits
Colledge</hi> in the <hi>Philippines</hi> in a Book of
300 pages, opposed those Decrees, which
was in the hands of the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Angelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi>
               <pb n="441" facs="tcp:45050:244"/>
and he gave it to a <hi>Dominican</hi> to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
who had been in those parts himself,
who fully proved the matter of fact,
and answered the <hi>Iesuits</hi> arguments,
both which the <hi>Bishop</hi> saith, were in his
custody. The short of their instructions
to their <hi>Converts</hi> was this, to speak little of
<hi>Christ Crucified,</hi> but to conceal that part of
<hi>Christian Doctrine</hi> as much as may be, to
use all the same customes that the <hi>Idolaters</hi>
did, only directing all their worship to
Christ and the Saints; not to trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
about Fasting, Penance, Confession,
and participation of the Eucharist, or the
severity of Repentance and Mortification.
They designed to recommend, as easie a
<hi>Religion</hi> to them as may be, the better to
invite them to embrace it; and therefore
as the <hi>Bishop</hi> observes, we read of no <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi>
among them: the poor <hi>Dominicans</hi>
and <hi>Franciscans</hi> are whipt, and imprisoned,
and banished; but the <hi>Iesuits</hi> who Preach
only a glorious <hi>Christ,</hi> without his <hi>passion</hi>
and <hi>crosse,</hi> have far better and easier enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
among them. But these things
the <hi>Bishop</hi> there gives a larger account of:
I return to the Controversie between the
<hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>them:</hi> An <hi>Agent</hi> was sent to <hi>Rome</hi>
by the <hi>Bishop</hi> with this letter to negotiate
his business there against the <hi>Iesuits, a
man intelligent,</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Amours Iournal. p. 5. ch. 15.</note> 
               <hi>vigorous</hi> and <hi>undaunted,</hi> saith
<hi>Mr. S. Amour</hi> of him; who followed his
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:45050:245"/>
business so close, that after long solicitation
and address, he obtains another <hi>Decree</hi>
against the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> which is extant at large
in the <hi>Lyons</hi> Edition of the <hi>Bullarium:</hi>
but which ought to be observed, is since
prohibited by the <hi>Index Expurgatorius</hi> of
<hi>Alexander</hi> 7.<note place="margin">Index A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lex. A.D. 1658.</note> by whose means that was
procured is easie to conjecture, when we
consider with what difficulty the <hi>Decree</hi> was
obtained; and for above a <hi>year</hi> after the
passing it, the coming of it forth was hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
by <hi>Cardinal Spada</hi> under-hand, who
was a great Friend to the <hi>Iesuits.</hi> And
when it did come forth, the <hi>Iesuits</hi> bought
up all the <hi>Copies</hi> of it they could,<note place="margin">S. Amours Iournal. p. 7. ch. 5.</note> on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to abolish the memory of it: which
made them obtain the prohibition of the
<hi>Bullarium,</hi> till that part were purged out of
it. But if the <hi>Popes</hi> had any real kindness
for the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Bishops,</hi> they would
never suffer such encroachments to be made
upon them, as they do, nor shew so much
favour to the contemners of it. But this is
one of the grand <hi>Intrigues</hi> of the <hi>Roman
Court,</hi> to keep the <hi>Bishops</hi> down by the
<hi>priviledges</hi> of the <hi>Regulars</hi> who are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
<hi>dependents</hi> on the <hi>Popes;</hi> only at some
times when they cannot help it, they must
seem to curb them, but yet so as to keep
them in heart enough to <hi>bait</hi> the <hi>Bishops,</hi>
when they begin to exercise their <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
as they ought to do in the reformation
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:45050:245"/>
of abuses and disorders. But by these
heats and controversies among them about
matters of <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
that they have no cause to upbraid
us with our <hi>dissensions</hi> about them: And
that they have no more effectual means to
suppress them than <hi>We.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 11. 2. As to <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>doctrine.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Of their differences in matters of doctrine.</note>
The least thing any one could imagine by
all the boasts of <hi>Vnity</hi> among them, and
upbraiding others with their <hi>dissensions,</hi> is,
that they are all of one mind in <hi>matters of
doctrine;</hi> but he must believe against com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sense and experience that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
this. For we know their <hi>divisions</hi>
well enough, and that it is as easie a matter
to compose all the differences among us
as among them. We may assoon perswade
the <hi>Quakers</hi> to <hi>Vniformity,</hi> as reconcile the
<hi>Dominicans</hi> and the <hi>Iesuits;</hi> and all our
<hi>Sects</hi> will agree assoon as the <hi>factions</hi> of
the <hi>Thomists</hi> and <hi>Scotists;</hi> the <hi>Presbyterians</hi>
and <hi>Independents</hi> will yield to <hi>Episcopal
jurisdiction,</hi> assoon as the <hi>Monastick Orders</hi>
will quit their <hi>priviledges;</hi> the <hi>Arminians</hi>
and <hi>Calvinists</hi> will be all of a mind when
the <hi>Iansenists</hi> and <hi>Molinists</hi> are: and we are
apt to think that our Controversies about
<hi>Ceremonies</hi> are not altogether of so great
importance as theirs about <hi>infallibility.</hi>
But it is a very pleasant thing to see by
what arts they go about to perswade credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:45050:246"/>
people, that what would be called
<hi>divisions</hi> any where else, is an <hi>admirable
Vnion</hi> among them; they might assoon
perswade them that the seven Hills of
<hi>Rome</hi> are the <hi>bottomless pit;</hi> or that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
may be true. For either the <hi>Pope</hi> is
infallible or he is not, either the supream
<hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> is committed to
him alone as <hi>S. Peters</hi> Successor, or to
the representative Church in a <hi>Council,</hi>
either he hath a temporal power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<hi>Princes,</hi> or he hath not; either the
<hi>V. Mary</hi> was conceived with <hi>Original sin,</hi>
or she was not; either there is a <hi>Pre-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination,</hi>
or there is not; either <hi>Souls</hi>
may be delivered out of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> or
they may not: Dare any of them say
they are all of a mind in the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>Rome</hi> about these points? I am sure they
dare not. But what then? do they not
differ from one another? do they not
write, and Preach, and rail against each
other as much as any Sectaries can do?
are there not factions of long continuance
among them upon these differences?
where then lyes their <hi>Vnity</hi> they boast off?
Alas! we speak like Ignorant persons, and
do not consider what artificial men we
have to deal with; who with some pretty
tricks and slights of hand make all that
which seems to us shattered and broken
in pieces to appear sound and entire without
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:45050:246"/>
the least crack or flaw in it. It will be
worth the while to find out these arts, for I
do not question but by a discreet managing
them, they may serve us as well as them, and
our Church will have, (though not so
much splendour) yet as much <hi>Vnity</hi> as
theirs. They tell us therefore that it is
true they are not all of a mind, <hi>and it is not
necessary to the</hi> Unity <hi>of the Church that
they should be:</hi> but, they have <hi>the only way
of composing differences;</hi> and they do not
differ <hi>in matters of faith from each other;</hi>
and <hi>their differences lye only in their Schools,
and do not disturb the peace of the Church.</hi>
This is the utmost I can find their best wits
plead for the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church;</hi>
and if these be sufficient, I believe they and
we will be proved to be as much at Unity,
as they are among themselves.</p>
            <p>1. They say <hi>the Vnity of the Church doth
not lye in actual Agreement of the members
of it in matters of Doctrine; but in having
the best means to compose differences and to
preserve consent; which is, submission to the
Popes Authority.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Greg. de Valent. Analys. fid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

explains the <hi>Vnity</hi> of their <hi>Church; for
actual consent,</hi> he grants, <hi>may be in other
Churches as much as theirs, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
singular or peculiar attributed to their
Church, supposing they were all of a mind,
which it is plain they are not; but therein,</hi>
saith he, <hi>lyes the Vnity of their Church, that
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:45050:247"/>
they all acknowledge one Head in whose
judgement they acquiesce: and therefore they
have no more to do but to know what the
Pope determines.</hi> If this be all their Unity,
we have greater than they, for we have a
more certain way of ending Controversies
than they have: which I prove by an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
like to one in great request among
them, when they go about to perswade weak
persons to their <hi>Religion,</hi> viz. <hi>that it must
needs be safer to be in that Religion wherein
both parties agree, a man may be saved; than
in that where one side denies a possibility of
salvation;</hi> so say I here, that must be a
safer way for Unity which both parties
agree in to be infallible, than that which
one side absolutely denyes to be so; but
both parties agree the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,
and all <hi>Protestants</hi> deny the <hi>Pope</hi>
to be infallible; therefore ours is the
more certain way for <hi>Vnity.</hi> But this is
not all, for it is far from being agreed
among themselves that the <hi>Pope</hi> is <hi>infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi>
it being utterly denyed by some
among them, and the asserting it accounted
<hi>Heresie:</hi> as is evident in some late Books
written to that purpose in <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>England:</hi> What excellent means of <hi>Vnity</hi>
then is this among them; which it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
by some no less than <hi>Heresie</hi> to
assert?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="447" facs="tcp:45050:247"/>
§. 13. But supposing they should yield
the <hi>Pope</hi> that submission which they deny to
be due to him, yet is his definition so much
more certain way of ending Controversies
than the <hi>Scriptures?</hi>
               <note place="margin">The insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of the <hi>Popes</hi> Authority for ending these diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</note> Let them name one
Controversie that hath been ended in their
<hi>Church</hi> meerly by the <hi>Popes Decrees;</hi> so as
the opposite party hath declared, that they
believed contrary to what they believed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
on the account of the <hi>Popes</hi> definition.
We have many instances to the contrary,
wherein controversies have been heightened
and increased by their interposing, but none
concluded by them. Do they say the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi>
can be no means of <hi>Vnity,</hi> because of
the various <hi>senses</hi> which have been put
upon it? and have they no wayes to evade
the <hi>Popes</hi> definitions? Yes, so many, that
his <hi>Authority</hi> in truth signifies nothing, any
farther than they agree that the upholding
it tends to their common interest. But
when onces he comes to cross the interest
of any party, if they do not in plain terms
defie him, yet they find out more civil
wayes of making his <hi>Definitions</hi> of no force.
Either they say the <hi>Decree</hi> was procured by
<hi>fraud,</hi> and the <hi>Pope</hi> made it by mis-informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is the common way, or he did
not define it as a <hi>matter of faith</hi> sitting
<hi>in Cathedrâ,</hi> or the <hi>sense</hi> of his defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
is quite otherwise than their
<hi>Adversaries</hi> understand it; or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:45050:248"/>
that be the sense, the <hi>Pope</hi> is
never to be supposed to define any thing
contrary to the <hi>Scriptures</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> and
<hi>ancient Canons:</hi> Of all which it were no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
task to give late and particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances;
but no one who is acquainted with
the history of that <hi>Church</hi> can be ignorant
of them, and the late proceedings in the
point of the <hi>five Propositions</hi> are a sufficient
evidence of these things to any one who
reads them. For when was there a Fairer
occasion given to the <hi>Pope</hi> to shew his <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
for preservation of the <hi>Churches</hi> uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
than at that time when the matter of
the <hi>five Propositions</hi> was under debate at
<hi>Rome:</hi> The same controversie was now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
which had disturbed their <hi>Church</hi> so
often and so much before. In the time of
<hi>Clement</hi> 8. the heats were so great between
the <hi>Iesuits</hi> and <hi>Dominicans,</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi>
thought it necessary for the peace of the
<hi>Church</hi> to put an end to them, to that end
he appointed Congregations for several
years to discuss those points, that he might
come to a resolution in them. This <hi>Pope</hi>
at first was strangely prepossest by the arts of
the <hi>Iesuits</hi> against the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> but
sending for the <hi>General</hi> of the <hi>Dominicans,</hi>
he told him what sad apprehensions he had
concerning the peace of the <hi>Church,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the disputes between the <hi>Iesuits</hi> and
them; and therefore charges him that those
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:45050:248"/>
of his <hi>Order</hi> should no longer molest the
<hi>Iesuits</hi> about these things; to whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
<hi>that he assured him with as great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
as he was able, that it was no meer
Scholastical dispute between them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Amours Iournal p. 3. ch. 10.</note> 
               <hi>but it was
the cause of faith that was concerned;</hi> which
he discoursed largely upon to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and
made such impressions upon him, that the
<hi>Dominicans</hi> verily believe,<note place="margin">Iournal p. 6. ch. 26.—P. 3. ch. 8.</note> that had that
<hi>Pope</hi> lived to the <hi>Vespers</hi> of <hi>Pentecost</hi> that
year he dyed in <hi>March,</hi> he had published a
<hi>Bull</hi> against the <hi>Iesuits</hi> in presence of the
<hi>Colledge</hi> of <hi>Cardinals,</hi> and created <hi>F. Lemos
Cardinal.</hi> After his death the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were continued in the time of <hi>Paul</hi> 5.
but at last were broken up without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
at all. If the <hi>Popes</hi> determination
be such an absolute <hi>Instrument of peace</hi> in the
<hi>Church,</hi> it is the strangest thing in the world,
it should be made so little use of in such
cases where they all acknowledge it would
be of infinite advantage to their <hi>Church,</hi> to
have an issue put to such troublesome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
as these were. But they know
well enough, that the <hi>Popes Authority</hi> is
the more esteemed the less it is used, and
that it hath alwayes been very hazardous to
determine where there have been conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
parties, on both sides; for fear the
condemned party should renounce his <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi>
or speak plainer truths than they
are willing to hear. And therefore it was
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:45050:249"/>
well observed by <hi>Mons. S. Amour,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iournal p. 1. ch. 9.</note> 
               <hi>that they
are very jealeus at Rome of maintaining the
Authority of the decrees which issue from thence,
and that this consideration obliges the maker
of them to look very well to the compliance
and facility that may be expected in their exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
before they pass any at all.</hi> Which is
a most certain argument they dare not trust
the <hi>Popes infallibility,</hi> nor all the promises
they pretend <hi>Christ</hi> hath made to their
<hi>Church;</hi> but govern their affaires wholly
by the rules of <hi>humane Policy.</hi> And on this
account when the heats brake forth in
<hi>France</hi> about <hi>Iansenism;</hi> and both parties
made application to the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> the
<hi>Pope</hi> could never be prevailed with to suffer
the main controversies to be touched, or
any decree to pass about them, but at last
condemned some ambiguous <hi>Propositions</hi> as
taken out of <hi>Iansenius</hi> his book; which
both parties condemned according to their
different senses, and they were left to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
it out, which sense it was the <hi>Pope</hi>
meant them in. And therefore the <hi>Ianse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists
Advocate</hi> who was well versed in the
practices of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> gave them
the truest account of the intentions of that
<hi>Court</hi> in their affaire,<note place="margin">Iournal p. 6. ch 3.</note> which was, <hi>to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
both the one side and the other;</hi> and that
<hi>Cardinal Ginetti</hi> had told him that <hi>either no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
would be done,</hi>

<pb n="451" facs="tcp:45050:249"/>
therefore in stead of ending the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
the <hi>Popes</hi> definition only produced
more, <hi>viz.</hi> whether the <hi>Propositions</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
were in <hi>Iansenius</hi> or no? whether
the <hi>Pope</hi> might not erre in matter of fact?
the <hi>Iansenists</hi> affirming this, the <hi>Iesuits</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
it and charging each other with no
less than <hi>Heresie</hi> about it. For upon the
<hi>Iesuits</hi> asserting <hi>Octob. 12. A.D. 1661. that
the Pope hath the same infallibility that Iesus
Christ hath, not only in Questions of right
but in matters of fact, and that thence those
of their Church are bound to believe with a
divine faith, that the 5. condemned Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are in Iansenius:</hi> the <hi>Iansenists</hi> publish
<q>a charge of heresie against the <hi>Iesuits</hi> and
such as was never broached in the <hi>Church</hi>
before: being not only a solitary error or
simple <hi>heresie,</hi> but a whole source of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
or rather an <hi>universal heresie</hi> which
overthrows all <hi>Religion.</hi> Which they
goe about at large to prove by shewing,
that this builds mens faith on the <hi>word
of man</hi> and not on <hi>the word of God,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it concerns a thing neither revealed
nor attested by <hi>God,</hi> as to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Propositions</hi> are really an <hi>Authors</hi> of
this last Age; and (as he goes on) to
make the <hi>Popes</hi> word equal with the <hi>word
of God,</hi> is not only <hi>heresie</hi> but horrid <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety</hi>
and a <hi>species</hi> of <hi>Idolatry:</hi> for this is
giving to man the honour due only to
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:45050:250"/>
                  <hi>God:</hi> because such an entire submission of
our mind and of all our intellectuals
comprehended in the act of our faith
is that Adoration which we pay to the
prime <hi>verity</hi> it self.</q> And I dare now leave
any one to Judge, whether upon so late an
experiment of the <hi>Constitutions</hi> of two <hi>Popes
Innocent</hi> 10. and <hi>Alexander</hi> 7. in order to
the ending so great a Controversie as this
was, it be not apparent, that the <hi>Popes
Authority</hi> signifies no more to the ending
Controversies, than the parties who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
are willing that it should <hi>i. e.</hi> as far
as they doe consent to obey them and no
farther?</p>
            <p>§. 14. But it may be said,<note place="margin">The insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils to end Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies.</note> 
               <hi>that it is true
there are differences among them about the
Popes power and infallibility, and therefore
he may not be so fit to end Controversies, but
there is no dispute among them, about Pope
and Council together, therefore in that case
they are all agreed, that they ought to submit.</hi>
These are fine things to be said, and appeare
plausibly to those who doe not search into
them; but those that doe, will easily find
this as ineffectual a remedy as the other.
For if we examine but the ways used by
the several parties among them to avoid
the decisions of some <hi>Councils</hi> against their
particular opinions, we may see how little
the decrees of <hi>Councils</hi> can bind those who
have no mind to be tyed up by them. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:45050:250"/>
they say the decision depended on a
<hi>matter of fact,</hi> which the <hi>Council</hi> was not
sufficiently informed in, and they believe
a <hi>Council</hi> may erre in a matter of fact, or
else it did not proceed <hi>after the way of a
Council,</hi> or it was not general, or its <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees</hi>
were not received by the <hi>Catholick
Church,</hi> or though some were received yet
not all, or however, the infallibility of a
<hi>Council</hi> is not absolute; but supposing that
it proceeds according to the constant <hi>tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the <hi>Church,</hi> which unavoidably leaves
the matter as much under debate as if the
<hi>Council</hi> had never meddled with it.</p>
            <p>But if they doe in earnest believe, that
the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Council</hi> can put an end to
all Controversies among them when they
please, I would fain know why they have
not done this hitherto? Is not <hi>unity</hi> desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
among them? if not, why doe they
boast of it? if it be, why have they not
obtained it, since they can so easily doe it?
what made them so extremely cautious in
the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> of meddling with any
thing that was <hi>in Controversie among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?</hi>
or was it, that they were all so
much of a mind that they had nothing to
doe, but to condemn their enemies? which
was so far from being true, that there
were very few things which came into be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
that they were agreed in, and therefore
they were put sometimes to strange shifts
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:45050:251"/>
to find out general and ambiguous terms
which might not displease the <hi>dissenters,</hi>
and yet leave the disputes as great as ever.
They could not agree so much as about the
Title of the <hi>Council,</hi>
               <note place="margin">History of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent. l. 2. p.</hi> 138.</note> many of the <hi>Bishops</hi>

which was eagerly opposed by the <hi>Italians,</hi>

being no small controversie about words,
but of very great consequence about the
<hi>power</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> of <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Council,</hi> if
they had been suffered to goe on in it. But
the <hi>Pope</hi> hearing of this dispute at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
sent word to the Legats, <hi>not to
broach any new difficulties in matter of faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 149.</note>

high the <hi>Controversies</hi> among themselves
were between the <hi>Bishops</hi> and the <hi>Regulars</hi>
about <hi>priviledges,</hi> between the <hi>Dominicans</hi>
and <hi>Francise<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the <hi>Italian Bishops</hi> and others about
<hi>Residence</hi> and the extent of <hi>Episcopal power,</hi>
between the <hi>Divines</hi> in most of the matters
of doctrine, as might easily be shewed at
large, if I loved the pains of transcribing;
but I had rather referre the Reader to that
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:45050:251"/>
excellent history it self. But I only renew
my demand, why must no controversies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<hi>Catholicks</hi> be ended in the <hi>Council?</hi>
could they be better decided any where else?
if so, then the <hi>Council</hi> is not the best means
of <hi>Vnity;</hi> if not, then it seems there is no
necessity of ending controversies among them,
but they have <hi>Vnity</hi> enough without it.
And in truth, it is <hi>Interest</hi> and not <hi>Vnity</hi>
they look after, all such who hold opinions
contrary to their <hi>Interest</hi> must be proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against and condemned; but for others,
let them quarrel and dispute as long as they
will, they let them alone if they touch not
the <hi>Popes Authority,</hi> nor any of the gainful
opinions and practices which are allowed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them. And supposing their <hi>Interest</hi> be
kept up, which the <hi>Inquisition</hi> is designed for,
the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is as great a <hi>Friend</hi> to to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration
as may be, only what others call
<hi>different perswasions,</hi> they call School points,
and what others call <hi>divisions,</hi> they call <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes;</hi>
the case is the same with their <hi>Church</hi>
and others, only they have softer names
for the differences among themselves, and
think none bad enough for those who cast
off the <hi>Popes Authority</hi> and plead for a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</hi>
Here then lyes the profound
mystrey of their <hi>Vnity,</hi> that they are all
agreed against us, though not among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and are not we so against them too?
May not we plead for the <hi>Vnity,</hi> that they
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:45050:252"/>
have on the same grounds? We are all agreed
against <hi>Popery,</hi> as much as they are against
<hi>Protestants;</hi> only we have some <hi>Scholastick
disputes</hi> among us about indifferent things,
and the <hi>Episcopal Authority,</hi> as they have;
we have some zealous <hi>Dominicans,</hi> and busie
and factious men such as the <hi>Iesuits</hi> among
them are; but setting aside these disputes
we are admirably well agreed, just as they
are in the <hi>Roman Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 15. 2. They say,<note place="margin">Their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences are in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith.</note> 
               <hi>they doe not differ in
matters of faith.</hi> But this is as true as the
other; for are they agreed in <hi>matters of
faith</hi> who charge one another with <hi>heresie?</hi>
as we have already seen that they doe. But
if they mean that they doe not differ in <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of faith,</hi> because those only are <hi>matters
of faith</hi> which they are agreed in; they
were as good say, they are agreed in the
things they doe not differ about: for the
parties which differ doe believe the things
in difference to be <hi>matters of faith;</hi> and
therefore they think they differ from one
another in <hi>matter of faith.</hi> But they are
not agreed what it is which makes a thing
to be a <hi>matter of faith;</hi> and therefore no
one can pronounce that their differences are
not about <hi>matters of faith;</hi> for what one
may think not to be <hi>de fide,</hi> others may
believe that it is; we see the <hi>Popes personal
infallibility</hi> is become a <hi>Catholick doctrine</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> and declared to be plain
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:45050:252"/>
heresie by their Adversaries. The delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of souls from <hi>Purgatory</hi> by the prayers
of the living is generally accounted a <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of faith</hi> in the <hi>Roman Church;</hi> but we
know those in it who deny it, and say it
was a <hi>novel opinion</hi> introduced by <hi>Gregory</hi> 1.
against the consent of <hi>Antiquity.</hi> It is a
<hi>matter of faith,</hi> say the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and
<hi>Iansenists</hi> to attribute to God alone the
praise of converting grace, and that grace
efficacious by it self, was the doctrine of
<hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Councils</hi> and <hi>the Catholick
Church;</hi> and is it not then a <hi>matter of faith</hi>
in their opinion, wherein the <hi>Iesuits</hi> and
they differ from each other? To which
purpose it was well said by the author of
a Book printed at <hi>Paris</hi> A. D. 1651. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<hi>essayes</hi> and <hi>reflections on the state of
Religion,</hi>
               <q> that because of the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
between the <hi>Iansenists</hi> and the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits,</hi>
it might with more reason be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
now than in the time of <hi>Arrianism</hi>
it self, <hi>that the whole Church seems to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
heretical.</hi> For admitting, saith he,
what is most certain that the Church
hath decreed <hi>Calvinism, Pelagianism</hi> and
<hi>Semipelagianism</hi> to be <hi>heresies,</hi> and that
the <hi>Doctors</hi> are those who sit in the <hi>Chair</hi>
to be consulted withall upon points of
Religion, all <hi>Catholicks</hi> are reduced to a
most strange perplexity. For if a man
shall address himself to those of the <hi>Ian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senian</hi>
                  <pb n="458" facs="tcp:45050:253"/>
party, they will tell him that those
who are termed <hi>Molinists</hi> are <hi>Pelagians</hi>
or at least <hi>Semi-pelagians,</hi> and on the
other side the <hi>Molinists</hi> will bear him down
that their Adversaries are <hi>Calvinists</hi> or
else <hi>Novatians.</hi> Now all the <hi>Doctors</hi> of
the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> (a very few except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
are either of the one or the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
I leave you then to consider to what
prodigious streights mens minds are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
since this is held as a general <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime,</hi>
that whosoever fails in one point of
faith, fails in all</q>. It is a matter of <hi>faith,</hi>
say the <hi>Dominicans, that all persons, Christ only
excepted, were born in sin;</hi> and therefore
the contenders for the <hi>immaculate concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
must in their judgment differ in a <hi>point
of faith</hi> from them. But if this distinction
should be allowed to preserve the unity of
their Church, why shall it not as well cure
the <hi>divisions</hi> of ours. The most conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
in all respects of the <hi>dissenters</hi> from
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> declare that they
agree with us in all the <hi>articles of doctrine</hi>
required by our <hi>Church;</hi> will this be
enough in their opinion to make us at <hi>unity</hi>
with each other? if not, let them not plead
the same thing for themselves which they
will not allow to us. I cannot understand
that the controversies about <hi>Ceremonies</hi> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
in themselves) among us, are of
any greater weight, than the disputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:45050:253"/>
the <hi>Fryars</hi> concerning their <hi>habits</hi>
have been; and yet this controversie only
about the size of their <hi>hoods</hi> lasted in one
<hi>Order</hi> almost an <hi>Age</hi> together, and was
managed with as great a heat and animosity,
as ever these have been among us, and was
with very much adoe laid asleep for a time
by the endeavours of 4. <hi>Popes</hi> successively.
But if this signifies nothing to <hi>unity,</hi> to say,
<hi>that the matters are not great about which
the Controversies are, if the disturbances be
great which are caused by them,</hi> that will
reflect more sharply on their <hi>Church</hi> than
on ours, which hath so many differences
which they account not to be about any
<hi>matters of faith.</hi> But if these differences in
point of doctrine among them prove to be
none in <hi>matters of faith,</hi> it would be no
difficult task upon the same grounds to shew
that they have no reason to quarrel with
us for breaking the <hi>unity</hi> of their <hi>Church,</hi>
because then we may differ from them as
little in <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> as they doe from
one another. This I need not take upon me
to shew at large, because I find it already
done to my hand by <hi>F. Davenport, al. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta
Clara</hi> in his paraphrastical exposition of
the 39. articles of our <hi>Church:</hi> about
 <q>half of them he acknowledges to be <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,</hi>
as they are without any further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.
The first he meets with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
in is that, <hi>about the number of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:45050:254"/>
books</hi> point blank against the <hi>Council</hi>
of <hi>Trent,</hi> but he acknowledges that
<hi>Cajetan</hi> and <hi>Franciscus Mirandula</hi> fully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with our <hi>Church</hi> in it, who quote
<hi>Hierom, Ruffinus, Antoninus,</hi> and <hi>Lyra</hi>
of the same opinion, as they might have
done many others; but because our
<hi>Church</hi> doth not cast them wholly out of
the <hi>Canon,</hi> he dares not say it is guilty of
<hi>heresie</hi> simply; and the rather because
<hi>Waldensis</hi> and <hi>Driedo</hi> do hold that it is
only in the power of the whole <hi>Church</hi>
successively from the <hi>Apostles,</hi> to declare
what books are <hi>Canonical</hi> and what not.
For the 11. article about <hi>justification,</hi> he
saith the Controversie is only about words,
because we are agreed that <hi>God</hi> alone is
the efficient cause of Justification, and
that <hi>Christ</hi> and his passion are the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
cause of it; and the only question
is about the formal cause, which our
<hi>Church</hi> doth not attribute to the act of
faith as he proves by the book of <hi>Homilies.</hi>
but only makes it a condition of our
being justified, and they believe that by
faith we obtain our righteousness by
<hi>Christ;</hi> so that he can find no difference
between them and us in that point. He
saith, the Controversie about <hi>merit</hi> may
be soon ended according to the doctrine
of our Church, for they deny as well
as we article 1. 3. <hi>that any works done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:45050:254"/>
the Grace of Christ, and Inspiration of
his Spirit, can merit any thing,</hi> and when
we say, article 12. <hi>that good works which
follow justification, are pleasing and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to God in Christ;</hi> if by that we mean,
that they are accepted by Christ in order
to a reward, by vertue of the promise of
God through Christ, that is all the sense
of merit, which he or the school of <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
contends for. For <hi>works of supere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation</hi>
article 14. he saith our <hi>Church</hi>
condemns them upon that ground, <hi>that
men are said to do more by them than of duty
they are bounden to do,</hi> which being general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understood they condemn, he saith,
as well as we; because we can doe no
good works which upon the account of
our natural obligation we are not
bound to perform, though by particular
precept we are not bound to them. In
the 19 article where our Church saith,
<hi>that the Church of Rome hath erred not only
in their living and manner of ceremonies, but
also in matters of faith;</hi> he distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the particular <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> from
the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> which is frequently
understood by that name, and he saith it
is only a matter of faith to believe, that
the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> hath not erred, and
not that the particular <hi>Church of Rome</hi>
hath not. In the 20. article our
Church declares, <hi>that the Church ought
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:45050:255"/>
neither to decree any thing against holy
writ, so besides the same it ought not to
enforce any thing to be believed of necessity
to salvation;</hi> this he interprets of what is
neither actually nor potentially in the
<hi>Scriptures,</hi> neither in terms nor by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence;
and so he thinks it orthodox,
and not against traditions. Article 21.
wherein our Church determins expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>against the infalibility of general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi>
he understands it only of things,
that are not necessary to faith or manners;
which he saith is the common opinion
among them.</q> The hardest article one
would think to bring us off in, was the
22. <hi>viz. that the Romish doctrine concerning
Purgatory, Pardons, worshipping and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
as well of Images as of Reliques, and
also Invocation of Saints is a fond thing,
vainly invented and grounded upon no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty
of Scripture.</hi> But we need not des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
as long as one bred up in the <hi>Schools</hi>
of <hi>Scotus</hi> designes our rescue; he confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
it to be <q>
                  <hi>a difficult adventure,</hi> but
what will not subtilty and kindness doe
together? He observes very cunningly,
that these doctrines are not condemned
absolutely and in themselves, but only
the <hi>Romish</hi> doctrine about them; and
therein we are not to consider what the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> doth teach, but what
we apprehend they teach, or what we
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:45050:255"/>
judge of their doctrine, <hi>i. e.</hi> that they
invocate <hi>Saints</hi> as they doe <hi>God</hi> himself,
that <hi>Purgatory</hi> destroys the cross of <hi>Christ,</hi>
and warms the <hi>Popes Kitchin;</hi> that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons
are the <hi>Popes</hi> bills of <hi>Exchange,</hi>
whereby he discharges the <hi>debts</hi> of what
sinners he pleases; that they give pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<hi>divine worship</hi> to <hi>images</hi> and <hi>reliques;</hi>
all which, he saith, are impious do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
and we doe well to condemn
them.</q> So that it is not <hi>want</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi>
but <hi>want</hi> of <hi>wit,</hi> this good man condemns
us for; which if we attain to any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
measure of whereby to understand
their doctrine, there is nothing but abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<hi>peace</hi> and <hi>harmony</hi> between us. This
grand difficulty being thus happily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
all the rest is done with a wet fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
for what though our <hi>Church, Art.</hi> 24.
saith, <hi>that it is a thing plainly repugnant to the
word of God, and the custome of the primitive
Church to have publick prayer in the Church,
or to Minister the Sacraments in a tongue not
understood of the people.</hi> 
               <q>Yet what can
hinder a <hi>Scotist</hi> from understanding by
the <hi>Scripture,</hi> not the doctrine or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of it, but the delivery of it, <hi>viz.</hi>
that the <hi>Scripture</hi> was written in a
known tongue? nay he proves that our
<hi>Church</hi> is for praying in <hi>Latin</hi> by this
Article, because that either is a <hi>known
tongue</hi> or ought to be so, it being pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:45050:256"/>
lickly taught every where: and if it be
not understood, he saith, it is not <hi>per se</hi>
but <hi>per accidens</hi> that it is so;</q> I suppose
he means the <hi>Latin Tongue</hi> is not to blame
that the people do not understand it; but
they that they learned their <hi>lessons</hi> no better
at <hi>School.</hi> But what is to be said, for Women
who do not think themselves bound to go
to <hi>School</hi> to <hi>learn Latin?</hi> 
               <q>He answers
very plainly, that <hi>S. Paul</hi> never meant
them, for he speaks of those who were
to say <hi>Amen</hi> at the Prayers, but both
<hi>S. Paul.</hi> and the <hi>Canon Law,</hi> he <hi>tells us,</hi>
forbid women to speak in the Church.</q>
The case is then clear, <hi>S. Paul.</hi> never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
what language the <hi>Women</hi> used;
and it was no great matter whether they
understood their <hi>Prayers</hi> or not. But
what is to be said to the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi>
which pronounces an <hi>Anathema</hi> to those
who say, that <hi>Prayers</hi> are to be said only in
a known Tongue? <q>This doth not touch
our <hi>Church</hi> at all he thinks, because in
some <hi>Colledges</hi> the Prayers are said in
<hi>Latin:</hi> but although that be a known
tongue there, it is no matter, as long as
the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath put in the
word <hi>only,</hi> that clears our Church suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently.
Besides the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi>
speaks expresly of the <hi>Masse,</hi> which our
Article doth not mention, but only <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Prayers:</hi> and the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi>
                  <pb n="465" facs="tcp:45050:256"/>
speaks of those who condemns it as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the <hi>institution of Christ,</hi> but our
<hi>Church</hi> only condemns it as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the <hi>institution</hi> of the <hi>Apostle;</hi> but
all the commands of the Apostles are
not the commands of Christ, therefore
our Church declares nothing against <hi>faith</hi>
in this Article.</q> Are not we infinitely
obliged to a man that uses so much sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlety
to defend our <hi>Church</hi> from <hi>errrour</hi> in
<hi>faith?</hi> But that which is most considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
is, what he cites from <hi>Canus,</hi> 
               <q>that it is
no Heresie to condemn a custome or Law
of the Church, if it be not of something
necessary to salvation; especially if it be
a custome introduced since the Apostles
times, as most certainly this was.</q> For
the five <hi>Sacraments</hi> rejected by our <hi>Church,
Art.</hi> 25. he saith, <q>they are not absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rejected as Sacraments, but as Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the same Nature with Baptism
and the Lords Supper, which they yield
to.</q> For <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> which is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
denyed by our <hi>Church, Art.</hi> 28. <q>he
very subtilly interprets it of a carnal
presence of <hi>Christs</hi> Body, which he grants
to be repugnant to Scripture, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the nature of a Sacrament, but they
do believe Christs Body to be present
after the manner of a Spirit; and so
our Church doth not condemn theirs.</q>
As <hi>to communion in both kinds,</hi> asserted by
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:45050:257"/>
our <hi>Church, Art.</hi> 30. he saith, <q>it is not
condemned by the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
which only <hi>Anathematizes</hi> those who
make it necessary to Salvation, which our
Church mentions not: and however we
condemn communion in one kind, <hi>Canus</hi>
proves him not to be guilty of Heresie,
who should say that the <hi>Church</hi> hath
erred therein.</q> The 31 Article condemns
<hi>the Sacrifice of the Masse, i.e.</hi> saith he, <q>inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently
on the Sacrifice of the Crosse,
which is propitiatory of it self, and the
other only by vertue of it.</q> The 32. of
<hi>the lawfulness of Priests Marriage,</hi> 
               <q>he
understands of the <hi>Law of God;</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of which it is the most common
opinion among them, he saith, that it
is lawful. The 34. <hi>about Traditions,</hi> he
interprets of those which are not Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.
The Book of <hi>Homilies</hi> approved
<hi>Art.</hi> 35. he understands as they do Books
approved by their Church, not of every
sentence contained therein, but the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Doctrine; and he grants
there are many good things contained
therein. For the 36. of <hi>consecration of
Bishops and Ministers,</hi> he proves from
<hi>Vasquez, Conink, Arcudius,</hi> and <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
4.</hi> that our Church hath all the
essentials of <hi>Ordination</hi> required in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:
and if the difference of form of
words did null our Ordinations, it would
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:45050:257"/>
do those of the Greek Church too.</q>
The last Article he examins is, <hi>Art. 37.
Of the Civil Magistrates power in opposition to
the Popes Authority;</hi> and he grants, <q>that
the <hi>King</hi> may be allowed a <hi>Supermacy,
i.e.</hi> such as may not be taken away by
any one as his Superiour: and that by
custome, a sufficient right accrues to him
over all <hi>Ecclesiastical causes:</hi> and that by
divine and natural right he hath jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
over all <hi>Ecclesiastical persons,</hi> so far
as the publick good is concerned. And
withall he grants that we yield no spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
jurisdiction to the King, and no
more than is contended for by the <hi>French,</hi>
and the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </q> That part
which denyes the <hi>Popes jurisdiction</hi> in
<hi>England,</hi> he saith, <q>may be understood of
the <hi>Popes challenging England</hi> to be a
<hi>Fee</hi> of the <hi>Roman See;</hi> but if it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
understood, he makes use of many
Scholastick distinctions of <hi>actus signatus
&amp; exercitus, &amp;c.</hi> the sense of which is,
that it is in some cases lawful for a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
<hi>Prince</hi> to withdraw his obedience
from the <hi>Pope;</hi> but leaves it to be discussed
whether he had sufficient reason for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it.</q> But there can be no <hi>Heresie</hi> in
matter of <hi>fact:</hi> it remains then according
to the sense put upon our <hi>Articles</hi> by him
with the help of his <hi>Scholastick subtleties,</hi>
we differ no more from them in <hi>points</hi> of
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:45050:258"/>
               <hi>faith,</hi> than they do from one another. For
such kind of <hi>distinctions</hi> and <hi>senses</hi> are they
forced to use, and put upon each others
opinions, to excuse them from disagreeing
in <hi>articles of faith;</hi> and there is no reason
that we should not enjoy the benefit of
them as well as they: so that either they
must be guilty of differing in <hi>matters</hi> of
<hi>faith,</hi> or we are not.</p>
            <p>§. 16. 3. They plead,<note place="margin">Their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences not confined to their Schools.</note> that <hi>their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
are only confined to their Schools, and
do not disturb the peace of the Church.</hi> But
there is as little truth in this, as there is
<hi>Vnity</hi> in their <hi>Church:</hi> as plainly appears
by what hath been said already. Was the
Controversie about the <hi>Popes</hi> temporal
power confined to the <hi>Schools?</hi> did not that
make for several <hi>Ages</hi> as great disturbances
in the <hi>Church,</hi> as were ever known in it
upon any quarrel of <hi>Religion?</hi> Were the
Controversies between the <hi>Bishops</hi> and the
<hi>Monks</hi> confined to their Schools, about the
extent of the Episcopal jurisdiction in
former times, or in the renewing of this
<hi>Hierarchical Warr</hi> (as one of the <hi>Iansenists</hi>
calls it) in <hi>France?</hi> But these things are
at large discovered already; I shall only
adde one thing more, which seems more like
a dispute of the <hi>Schools</hi> between the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Orders</hi> among them about <hi>the immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
conception;</hi> and it will easily appear
that whereever that dispute began, it did
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:45050:258"/>
not rest in the <hi>Schools,</hi> if we consider the
<hi>tumults</hi> and <hi>disturbances</hi> which have been
made only on the account of it. This
Controversie began in the <hi>Schools</hi> about the
beginning of the 14 Century, when <hi>Scotus</hi>
set up for a new <hi>Sect</hi> in opposition to <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Aquinas,</hi> and among other points of
Controversie, he made choice of this to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
his followers by; but proposed it
himself very timerously, as appears by his
resolution of it in his Book on the <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Scot. in 3. lib. sent. dist. 3. q. 1. n. 10.</note> however his followers boast, that

to overthrow all Adversaries, and that he
did great wonders every where. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
this were, there were some not long
after him, who boldly asserted what he
doubtfully proposed, of whom <hi>Franciscus
Mayronis</hi> is accounted the first; after him
<hi>Petrus Aureolus, Occam</hi> and the whole or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of <hi>Franciscans.</hi> But the great strength
of this opinion lay not in the wit and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
of the defenders of it, nor in any
arguments from <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Antiquity,</hi>
but in that which they called the <hi>Piety</hi> of
it, <hi>i. e.</hi> that it tended to advance the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the B. <hi>Virgin.</hi> For after the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of her came to be so publick and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
in their <hi>Church,</hi> I do not in the least
wonder, that they were willing to believe
her to be <hi>without sin.</hi> I much rather admire
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:45050:259"/>
they do not believe all their <hi>Canonized
Saints</hi> to have been so too; and I am sure
the same reasons will hold for them all.
But this Opinion by degrees obtaining
among the people, it grew scandalous for
any man to oppose it. So <hi>Walsingham</hi>
saith towards the latter end of this Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury,<note place="margin">Walsin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>that so the whole Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

The occasion of this persecution arose
from a disturbance which happened in <hi>Paris</hi>
upon this Controversie, one <hi>Ioh. de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesono</hi>
publickly read against the <hi>immaculate
conception,</hi> at which so great offence was
taken, that he was convented before the
<hi>Faculty</hi> of <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> but he declared that
he had done nothing but by advice of the
<hi>chief</hi> of his <hi>Order,</hi> and that he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
what he had said to death. His pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
were condemned by the <hi>Faculty</hi>
and the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> upon which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals
to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and goes to <hi>Avignon</hi> to
<hi>Clem.</hi> 7. where the whole <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi>
appears for him, and the <hi>Vniversity</hi>
against him by their <hi>Deputies</hi> of whom <hi>Pet.
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:45050:259"/>
de Alliaco</hi> was the chief. The assertions
which he was condemned for, relating to
this matter were these following, as they
are written in a <hi>Manuscript</hi> of <hi>Petr. de Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aco</hi>
from which they are published by the
late author of the <hi>History</hi> of <hi>the Vniversity
of Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. To assert any thing to be true which
is against Scripture, is most expresly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to faith. This is condemned as <hi>false
and injurious to the Saints and Doctors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That all persons, Christ only except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
have not derived Original sin from
<hi>Adam,</hi> is expresly against faith. This is
condemned as <hi>false, scandalous, presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi>
and <hi>offensive to pious ears.</hi> Which he
affirms particularly of the <hi>B. Virgin,</hi> and is
in the same terms condemned.</p>
            <p>3. It is as much against Scripture to
exempt any <hi>one</hi> person from Original sin,
besides <hi>Christ,</hi> as to exempt <hi>ten.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. It is more against Scripture, that the
<hi>B.V.</hi> was not conceived in Original sin,
than to say that she was both in Heaven
and on Earth from the first Instant of her
Conception or Sanctification.</p>
            <p>5. That no exception ought to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
in explication of Scripture, but what
the Scripture it self makes. All which
are condemned as the former.</p>
            <p>Against these Censures he appeals to the
<hi>Pope,</hi> because therein <hi>the doctrine of St.</hi> Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas

               <hi>which is approved by the Church is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,</hi>
and that it was only in the <hi>Popes
power to determine any thing in these points.</hi>
Upon this the <hi>Vniversity</hi> publishes an <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getical</hi>
Epistle, wherein they declare that
they will rather suffer any thing, than en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
<hi>Heresie</hi> to spring up among them, and
vindicate their own authority in their Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures;
and earnestly beg the assistance of all

their care to suppress such dangerous do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines;
this was dated <hi>Febr. 14. A. D.

time; and at last the <hi>Vniversities</hi> Censure
was confirmed, and <hi>Ioh. de Montesono</hi> fled

on this Controversie, which he dares

<hi>greatness of them:</hi> such as happened in the

In <hi>Catalonia, A. D.</hi> 1451. and 1461. In

he saith, <hi>the Princes were forced to use
their utmost power to repress them for the

in the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Murcia, A. D.</hi> 1507. in
<hi>Boetica</hi> or <hi>Andaluzia, A. D.</hi> 1503. in
<hi>Castile, A. D.</hi> 1480. The like <hi>scandals</hi> he
mentions in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> on the same
account, and withall he saith, <hi>that these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
notwithstanding all the endeavours of
Popes, Princes, Bishops and Vniversities; but
the tumults,</hi> he saith, <hi>that happened of
later years in</hi> Spain, <hi>were incredibly turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and scandalous, and drawn from the
authentick Registers which were sent by the

to the Pope, which were so great, that those
alone were enough to move the Pope to make

            <argument>
               <p>The mis-interpreting Scripture doth not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
its being a rule of faith. Of the
superstitious observations of the Roman
Church. Of Indulgences; the practice of
them in what time begun, on what occasion,
and in what terms granted. Of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences
in Iubilees, in the Churches
at <hi>Rome,</hi> and upon saying some Prayers.
Instances of them produced. What opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
hath been had of Indulgences in
the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> some confess they
have no foundation in Scripture, or Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
others that they are pious frauds:
the miserable shifts the defenders of indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
were put to: plain evidences of their
fraud from the Disputes of the Schools
about them. The treasure of the Church
invented by <hi>Aquinas</hi> and on what occasion.
The wickedness of men increased by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences</hi>
acknowledged by their own
Writers: and therefore condemned by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of that Church. Of <hi>Bellarmins</hi> pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Christians opinion of them. Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:45050:262"/>
no meer relaxations of Canonical
Penance. The great absurdity of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Churches Treasure on which
Indulgences are founded, at large mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested.
The tendency of them to destroy
devotion proved by experience, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Doctrine. Of Communion in
one kind; no devotion in opposing an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of Christ. Of the Popes power
of dispensing contrary to the Law of God
in Oaths and Marriages. The ill conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of asserting Marriage in a Priest
to be worse than Fornication, as it is in
the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Of the uncertainty
of faith therein. How far revelation to
be believed against sense. The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to prove the uncertainty of their
faith defended. The case of a revolter and
a bred Papist compared as to salvation:
and the greater danger of one than the other
proved. The motives of the Roman Church
considered; those laid down by <hi>Bishop
Taylor</hi> fully answered by himself. An
account of the faith of Protestants laid
down in the way of Principles: wherein
the grounds and nature of our certainty of
faith are cleared. And from the whole
concluded, that there can be no reasonable
cause to forsake the communion of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> and to embrace that
of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="478" facs="tcp:45050:263"/>
§. 1. HAving thus far Vindicated the
<hi>Scriptures</hi> from being the cause
(by being read among us) of all the <hi>Sects</hi>
and <hi>Fanaticisms</hi> which have been in
<hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture doth not hinder its being a rule of faith.</note> I now return to the consideration
of the <hi>Remainder</hi> of his <hi>Reply.</hi> And one
thing still remains to be cleared concerning
the <hi>Scripture,</hi> which is, <hi>whether it can be a
most certain rule of faith and life, since
among Protestants it is left to the private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of every fanciful spirit:</hi> which
is as much as to ask, whether any thing can
be a rule, which may be mis-understood by
those who are to be guided by it? or, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be fit the people should know the
<hi>Laws</hi> they are to be governed by, because
it is a dangerous thing to mis-interpret
<hi>Laws,</hi> and none are so apt to do it as the
common people? I dare say, <hi>St. Augustin</hi>
never thought that <hi>Heresies arising from
mis-understanding Scriptures,</hi> were a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
argument against their being a <hi>Rule</hi> of
<hi>faith,</hi> or being read by the people, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by his discoursing to them in the
place quoted by him. For then he must
have said to them to this purpose,<note place="margin">S. August. tract. 18. in Iob. cap. 5.</note> 
               <q>Good
people, ye perceive from whence Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
spring, therefore as you would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
your soundness in the faith, abstain
from reading the Scriptures, or looking
on them as your <hi>rule;</hi> mind the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:45050:263"/>
of the <hi>Church,</hi> but trust not your
selves with the reading what <hi>God</hi> himself
caused to be writ: it cannot be denyed
that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> have far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
excellency in them than any other
writings in the world; but you ought
to consider the best and most useful
things are the most dangerous when
abused. What is more necessary to the
life of man than eating and drinking;
yet where lyes intemperance and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of surfetting, but in the use of these?
What keeps men more in their wits than
sleeping, yet when are men so lyable to
have their throats cut as in the use of
that? What more pleasant to the eyes
than to see the <hi>Sun,</hi> yet what is there so
like to put them out as to stare too long
upon him? Therefore since the most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
and useful things are most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
when they are abused; my advice
must be that ye forbear eating, sleeping and
seeing, for fear of being surfetted, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
or losing your sight; which you
know to be very bad things. I cannot
deny but that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are called
<hi>the bread of life,</hi> the <hi>food of our souls,</hi> the
<hi>light of our eyes,</hi> the <hi>guide of our wayes;</hi>
yet since there may be so much danger
in the use of <hi>food,</hi> of <hi>light,</hi> and of a
<hi>Guide,</hi> it is best for you to abstain from
them.</q> Would any man have argued
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:45050:264"/>
like <hi>St. Augustin</hi> that should talk at this
rate? yet this must have been his way of
arguing, if his meaning had been to have
kept the people from reading the <hi>Scriptures,</hi>
because Heresies arise from mis-understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them. But all that he inferrs from
thence, is what became a wise man to say,
viz. <hi>that they should be cautious in affirming
what they did not understand; and that</hi> hanc
tenentes regulam sanitatis, <hi>holding this still
as our rule of soundness in the faith, with
great humility; what we are able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
according to the faith we have received,
we ought to rejoyce in it as our food, what
we cannot, we ought not presently to doubt of,
but take time to understand it; and though
we know it not at present, we ought not to
question it to be good and true:</hi> and afterwards
saith, <hi>that was his own case as well as theirs.</hi>
What, <hi>S. Augustine</hi> a <hi>Guide</hi> and <hi>Father</hi> of
the <hi>Church</hi> put himself equal with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in reading and understanding <hi>Scriptures!</hi>
In which we not only see his humility, but
how far he was from thinking, that this
argument would any more exclude the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
from reading the <hi>Scriptures</hi> than the
great <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> For I pray,
were they the common people who first
broached Heresies in the Christian <hi>Church?</hi>
Were <hi>Arius, Nestorius, Macedonius, Eutyches,</hi>
or the great abettors of their Doctrines,
any of the <hi>Vulgar?</hi> If this argument then
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:45050:264"/>
holds at all, it must hold especially against
men of parts and learning, that have any
place in the <hi>Church,</hi> for they are much more
in danger of spreading <hi>Heresies</hi> by mis-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting
<hi>Scriptures</hi> than any others are.
<hi>But among Protestants,</hi> he saith, <hi>Scripture is
left to the Fanciful interpretation of every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Spirit.</hi> If he speaks of our <hi>Church</hi> he
knows the contrary, and that we profess
to follow <hi>the unanimous consent of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Fathers</hi> as much as they, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the doctrine of the <hi>four General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils.</hi>
But if there have been some among
us, who have followed their own <hi>Fancies</hi>
in interpreting <hi>Scripture;</hi> we can no more
help that, than they can do in theirs; and I
dare undertake to make good, that there
have never been more absurd, ridiculous,
and Fanciful Interpretations of <hi>Scripture,</hi>
than (not the common people, but) the
<hi>Heads</hi> of their <hi>Church</hi> have made, and
other persons in greatest reputation among
them. Which though too large a task for
this present design, may ere long be the
subject of another.</p>
            <p>For <hi>the authority of Henry</hi> 8. in the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
produced from him, when they yield
to it in the point of <hi>Supremacy;</hi> we may
do it in the six articles or other points of
<hi>Popery</hi> which he held to the last. But we
think it an advantage to our cause in the
matter of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> that they who were
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:45050:265"/>
               <hi>Papists,</hi> in other points as well as this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>reading the Scriptures,</hi> yet contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so earnestly against the <hi>Popes</hi> Authority
as <hi>Henry</hi> 8. and <hi>Stephen Gardiner, Bonner,</hi>
and the rest did. Doth he imagine that
<hi>Henry</hi> 8. is owned by us to be <hi>Head</hi> of our
<hi>Church</hi> as the <hi>Pope</hi> is with them, so as to
think him <hi>infallible?</hi> He <hi>would</hi> be <hi>Head</hi>
of the <hi>Popish Church</hi> in <hi>England</hi> in spight
of the <hi>Pope,</hi> but he never pretended to be
<hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> any farther than
the <hi>Supremacy</hi> went; and if they will not
believe him, when he was influenced, as
they think, by <hi>Cranmer,</hi> neither are we
to be tyed to his opinion when he was
guided by <hi>Stephen Gardiner</hi> or any other,
who were not greater enemies to <hi>Cranmer</hi>
than to the <hi>Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 2. The next thing,<note place="margin">Of their superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.</note> wherein I said
the sincerity of devotion is much obstruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their Church was by the multitude of
superstitious observations never used in the
primitive Church, as I said I was ready to
defend; to this, his answer is very short.
1. That I <hi>should have said to prove;</hi> but so
weak was I as to think the Affirmative was
to be proved and the Negative defended.
2. <hi>He denyes any such to be used in their
Church.</hi> I desire then to know his opinion
of baptizing bells, with God-fathers and
God-mothers holding the rope in their
hands, being buried in a Monks habit, Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:45050:265"/>
to images of Saints, sprinkling
holy water, spittle and salt in baptisme,
their rites of exorcism, <hi>Agnus Dei</hi>'s, the
Pageantry of the Passion-week, the carrying
about of the Host, the numbering of Ave
Marias and Pater Nosters to make Rosaries
and Psalters of the B. Virgin, the burning
tapers at noon day particularly on Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
day with great devotion, the incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of images, with many others which
might be mention'd: and if he can vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
these from <hi>superstition,</hi> it will be no
hard task to <hi>vindicate</hi> the <hi>Heathens</hi> in the
ceremonies of their devotion; and to prove
that there can be no such thing as <hi>Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
in the world.</p>
            <p>§. 3. I now come to the gross abuse of
people in <hi>Pardons</hi> and <hi>Indulgences,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences.</note> by
which I said the sincerity of devotion was
much obstructed among them: he tells
me, <hi>as an eye-witness, that there is great
devotion caused by them in Catholick Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries;
there being no Indulgence ordinarily
granted, but enjoyns him that will avail him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of it to confess his sins, to receive the
Sacraments, to pray, fast and give alms,
all which duties are with great devotion,</hi> he
saith, <hi>performed by Catholick people, which
without the incitement of an Indulgence had
possibly been left undone.</hi> I will not be so
troublesome to enquire what sincerity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
that was, he was an eye-witness of,
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:45050:266"/>
which was caused by Indulgences, nor
what sort of persons they were who were
thus devout at receiving them. I think it
will be sufficient for my purpose to prove,
that no persons in the world, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
what Indulgences mean, in the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> can be excited to any
<hi>devotion</hi> by them; but that on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
they tend exceedingly to the obstruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it: which I shall doe by shewing,
that either they are great and notorious
cheats, if that be not meant by them
which is expressed in them; or if it be,
that nothing could be invented that tends,
more to obstructing their own way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
than these doe. 1. That they are
great and notorious cheats, if that be not
meant by them which is expressed in them.
For which we are to understand first what
hath been expressed in their <hi>Indulgences.</hi>
2. What opinion those of their own <hi>Church</hi>
have had concerning them.</p>

And it is well observed by <hi>Morinus,</hi>

these <hi>Indulgences</hi> cannot be understood of

because such a <hi>remission of all sins is granted,
upon which eternal life</hi> followes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must respect <hi>God</hi> and not barely the

and many other days in the year,

years, nay <hi>plenary remissions,</hi> and yet escape

               <note place="margin">Durand. in sentent. l. 4. dist. 20. q. 3.</note> that very little can be affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with any certainty concerning Indulgences,
because neither the Scripture speaks ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly

               <hi>it can be no other than a</hi> notorious

            <p>2. Some in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have
called them <hi>pious frauds.</hi> This appears by
the Controversies which arose upon <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences,</hi>
at the same time when they began
to grow common.<note place="margin">Aquin. s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

tell us, <hi>that there were some in the
Church who said, that the intention of the
Church in Indulgences was only by a pious
fraud to draw men to charitable acts, which
otherwise they would not have done; as a
mother which promiseth her Child an apple
to run abroad, which she never gives him,
when she hath brought him to it.</hi> Which
is the very instance they used,<note place="margin">Greg. de Valent. de Indulg. c. 2.</note> as <hi>Gregory de
Valentiâ</hi> confesseth. But this <hi>Aquinas</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
as a very dangerous opinion, <hi>because
this is in plain terms to make the Church
guilty of a notorious Cheat; and as,</hi> he
saith, <hi>from St.</hi> Augustine, <hi>if any falshood be
found in Scripture, it takes away the authority
of the whole; so if the Church be guilty of
a cheat in one thing, she will be suspected in all
the rest.</hi> This, saith <hi>Bonaventure, is to make
the Church to lye and deceive, and Indulgences
to be vain and childish toyes.</hi> But for all
these hard words, they had a great deal of
reason on their side: for the <hi>Indulgences</hi>
were express for the remission of the sins
of those who did such and such things, as
the giving a small summ of money towards
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:45050:275"/>
the building of a Church, or an <hi>Hospital;</hi>
they therefore asked <hi>whether the Indulgences
were to be taken as they were given or no?</hi>
if they were, then all those had <hi>full remission
of sins</hi> on very easie terms; if not, then
what is this else but <hi>fraud</hi> and <hi>cheating,</hi> and
can be only called <hi>pious</hi> because the work
was good which they did? This put the
defenders of <hi>Indulgences</hi> very hard to it;
<hi>Praepositivus,</hi> one of the eldest of the <hi>Schoolmen</hi>
confesseth <hi>that it looks a little oddly for a
man to be absolved from all his sins for three
pence,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Apud. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin. l. 10. c. 20. n. 5.</note> 
               <hi>given in three several places; and that
the rich by this means have a mighty advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
over the poor:</hi> but he resolves it all
<hi>into the power of the Church. Petrus Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>
confesseth the difficulties great,<note place="margin">Ib. n. 7.</note> but <hi>only
for the Churches Authority;</hi> and especially in
those general <hi>Indulgences</hi> which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
without any distinctions. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he saith <hi>Greg.</hi> 4. as he calls him <hi>(Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus</hi>
thinks <hi>Greg. 8.)</hi> in the Dedication of
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Benevento,</hi> told the people <hi>it
was much safer for them to undergoe their
penance than to receive an Indulgence from
him of any part of it:</hi> and another <hi>Bishop,</hi>
being desired an <hi>Indulgence</hi> would give it
but for two dayes; but if any one asks,
whether the remission of sins were present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obtained after <hi>Indulgence,</hi> or only when
they are uncapable of penance, <hi>viz.</hi> after
death; <hi>for his part,</hi> he saith, <hi>he desires them
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:45050:275"/>
to consult the Pope or the Bishop that gives the
Indulgence, whether of these opinions is true;</hi>
and when the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> shewed him
the magnificent <hi>Church</hi> he had built by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of Indulgences, <hi>Cantor</hi> told him, <hi>he had
done much better if he had let them alone, and
perswaded the people to undergoe their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But because the form of <hi>Indulgences</hi> ran
in such large and general terms; it grew
to be a great <hi>Question</hi> among the <hi>Schoolmen,
Whether the validity of Indulgences was
as great as the words of them?</hi> which in
other terms is whether the <hi>Church</hi> did cheat
or not in giving them? for if they were
not to understand them according to the
plain words of them; what is this but a
<hi>gross imposture</hi> to abuse the credulous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and laugh in their sleeves at them for
their simplicity. For while the people have
so good an opinion of their <hi>Church</hi> as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the truth of what she declares, and to
take <hi>Indulgences</hi> according to the sense of
the words; if their meaning who give
them be otherwise than is expressed, it is
one of the most abominable <hi>cheats</hi> that ever
was invented by men. For picking purses,
forging deeds, or betraying men are tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
things in comparison; but to abuse and
ruine their souls under a pretence of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
their sins, is the utmost degree of
fraud and imposture. Let us now see how
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:45050:276"/>
these <hi>Hucksters</hi> defend their <hi>Church</hi> in this
case; for the <hi>Question</hi> hath been debated
among the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> ever since <hi>Indulgences</hi>
came up. Some resolve it thus, that <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences</hi>
do signifie as much as the <hi>Church</hi>
declares,<note place="margin">Guil. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tissiodor. sum l. 4. tract. 6. c. 9.</note> but with these conditions, that
there be sufficient authority in the giver,
necessity in the receiver, that he believes the
Church hath power to give them, that
he be in a state of grace, and give a
sufficient compensation, which is to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
what they said, unless those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
were expressed in the Indulgences.
Some say that common Indulgences held
only for sins of Ignorance,<note place="margin">Morin. l. 10. c. 21. n. 3</note> others for venial
sins, others for penances negligently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
others for Purgatory pains. Some
again said that these could signifie no more
than a relaxation of <hi>Canonical Penance,</hi>
whatever the words were, and that they
were introduced for no other end; and
they do not reach any farther than the
<hi>Churches Canonical power</hi> or judgement
doth, and not to the judgement of God.
But this opinion,<note place="margin">Greg. de Valent. de Indulg. c. 2.</note> saith <hi>Greg. de Valentiâ</hi>
doth not differ from the <hi>Hereticks;</hi> and
<hi>withall,</hi> he saith, <hi>upon this principle, Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
do more hurt than good; for if it were
not for them; the sinner by his penance might
take away some part of his punishment, but
now he relyes upon his Indulgence and does
no penance, and so undergoes his whole pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:45050:276"/>
Albertus M.</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Albert. M. in sent. l. 4. dist. 20. art. 17.</note> 
               <hi>they are much
mistaken who say that Indulgences are to be
understood as large as their words are, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any farther condition; and that this is
to enlarge the Court of Gods mercy too far;
and sayes many conditions are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
which are not expressed in them.</hi> This
gave the first occasion to the <hi>Treasure</hi> of the
<hi>Church,</hi> invented by <hi>Aquinas</hi> to satisfie this
argument of <hi>Albertus</hi> concerning the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of <hi>God</hi> being extended too far by <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences;</hi>
for hereby what punishment is taken
away from one is made up by the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of another, which is reckoned upon
his account. And therefore, he saith, the
cause of the remission of punishment is not
the devotion, work, or gift of the receiver,
but the Treasure of merits which was in
the <hi>Church</hi> which the Pope might dispense;
and therefore the quantity of the remission
was not to be proportioned to the <hi>acts</hi> of
the receiver, but to the <hi>stock of the Church?</hi>
This rich <hi>Banck</hi> of the Churches Stock be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus happily discovered, they do not
question now but to set all accounts even
with it; and therefore <hi>Aquinas</hi> confidently
affirms, <hi>that Indulgences are to be understood
simply as they are expressed; for God,</hi> saith he,
<hi>doth not need our lye or deceit; which he
grants, must have been if Indulgences had
not been meant as they were expressed; and
all men would sin mortally who Preached In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences,
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:45050:277"/>
Yet to obtain the Indulgence,</hi> he
saith, <hi>that every man must give according to
his ability;</hi> for the objection being put,
concerning an <hi>Indulgence</hi> being given to
three several places, that whosoever gives
a penny towards the building of a Church
in every one of these places, shall for each
of them have the third part of his sins for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
him, so that for three pence a man
gets a <hi>plenary remission;</hi> he answers, <hi>that a
poor man may indeed have it so, but it is to
be understood that a rich man ought to give
more.</hi> For it is all the reason in the world
that a rich man should pay greater <hi>Vse</hi> for
the <hi>stock</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> than a poor man
can do: and it is reasonably to be presumed
that he had more sins to be pardoned than
the other, and therefore whatever the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
terms are, there must be some reserve
to hook in more from the rich than was
expressed in the first bargain. But if the
rich man should plead <hi>Law</hi> in the case, and
cry out it was <hi>Covin</hi> and <hi>Fraud,</hi> to demand
more than the <hi>first Contract</hi> was; I am not
skilful enough to determin what <hi>action</hi> the
<hi>Church</hi> can have against him. But there is
another shrewd objection mentioned by
<hi>Bonaventure,</hi> which is, <hi>that a man gets by
sinning,</hi> as suppose two men to receive the
remission of a <hi>third part</hi> of their sins by an
<hi>Indulgence,</hi> one owes but it may be 90 years
penance for his sins, and another hath run
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:45050:277"/>
upon the score so far that he owes
900 years, both receive a third part <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence;</hi>
in which case we see plainly the
greater sinner hath mightily the advantage
of the other, and where one gets but
30. the other gets 300. And therefore
<hi>Bonaventure</hi> is fain to run back again and
to say, <hi>that Indulgences are not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
as they are expressed, and that they are
not equal to all; but it was not fit to express
it so, because this would hinder peoples esteem
of the Indulgence.</hi> Which in plainer terms
is, that it is necessary to <hi>cheat</hi> the people,
or else there is no good to be done by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences.</hi>

to</hi> Rome <hi>for them.</hi> About the same time
flourished <hi>Wesselus Groningensis</hi> incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
the best Scholar of his Age, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
called <hi>Lux mundi,</hi> he was not only
skilled in <hi>School Divinity</hi> (almost the only
learning of that time) but in the <hi>Greek,
Hebrew, Chaldee</hi> and <hi>Arabick,</hi> having tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
into <hi>Greece, Aegypt,</hi> and been in most
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:45050:278"/>
               <hi>Vniversities</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> and read the most
ancient Authors in all kinds of learning;
on the account of his learning he was much
in favour with <hi>Sixtus</hi> 4. and was present
and admired at the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Basil;</hi> but
he was so far from being a friend to <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Wesseli Groning. oper. p. 867, &amp;c.</note>
that in his Epistles he saith, <hi>that no
Popes could grant an Indulgence for an hour,
and that it is a ridiculous thing to imagine
that for the same thing done, sometimes an
Indulgence should be granted for 7 years,
sometimes for 700, sometimes for 7000, and
sometimes for ever by a plenary remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and that there is not the least foundation
in Scripture for the distinction of remitting
the fault and the punishment, upon which the
doctrine of Indulgences is founded. That the
giving them was a design of covetousness, and
although the Pope once sware to the King of</hi>
France's <hi>Embassadour, that he did not know
the corruptions of the sellers of Indulgences,
yet when he did know them he let them alone,
and they spread farther. That God himself
doth not give plenary remission to contrition
and confession, and therefore the Pope can much
less do it: But if God doth forgive, how
comes the Pope to have power to retain? and
if there be no punishment retained when God
forgives, what hath the Pope<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to do to release?</hi>
Against him writes one <hi>Iacobus Angularis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iac. Angu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.in ep. Wesseli.</note>
he confesseth <hi>there is nothing in Scripture or
Antiquity expresly for Indulgences; but that
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:45050:279"/>
ought to be no argument, for there are many
other things owned in their Church as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
points which have as little foundation as
this,</hi> viz. <hi>S.</hi> Peters <hi>being at</hi> Rome, <hi>and
Sacramental confession; and therefore at last
he takes Sanctuary in the Popes and Churches
authority.</hi> To this <hi>Wesselus</hi> answers,
<q>that Indulgences were accounted <hi>pious
frauds</hi> before the time of <hi>Albertus</hi> and
<hi>Thomas;</hi> that there was a great number
of <hi>Divines</hi> did still oppose the errours and
practices of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> in this
matter; that supposing the Church were
for them, yet the authority of <hi>Scripture</hi>
is to be preferred before it, and no multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of men whatsoever is to be believed
against <hi>Scripture:</hi> that, he had not taken
up this opinion rashly, but had main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
it in <hi>Paris</hi> thirty three years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and in the <hi>Popes</hi> poenitentiary Court
at <hi>Rome;</hi> and was now ready to change it, if
he could see better reason for the contrary.
That the doctrine of <hi>Indulgences</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
very confusedly and uncertainly,
by which it appeared to be no <hi>Catholick
doctrine:</hi> that it is almost impossible to
find two men agree in the explication of
them, that the doctrine of <hi>Indulgences</hi>
was so far from being firmly believed
among them, that there was not the
strictest person of the <hi>Carthusian</hi> or other
orders that should receive a <hi>plenary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence</hi>
                  <pb n="511" facs="tcp:45050:279"/>
at the hour of death, that yet
would not desire his <hi>Brethren</hi> to pray for
his soul: which is a plain argument he
did not believe the validity of the <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence:</hi>
that many in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>
did speak more freely against them than
he did. That, the <hi>Popes</hi> authority is very
far from being <hi>infallible;</hi> or being owned
as such in the <hi>Church;</hi> as appeared by
the <hi>Divines</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> condemning the <hi>Bull</hi>
of <hi>Clement</hi> 6. about <hi>Indulgences,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he took upon him to <hi>command</hi> the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi>
and gave <hi>plenary remissions</hi> both from
the <hi>fault</hi> and <hi>punishment.</hi> Which authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
<hi>Bulls,</hi> he saith, were then to be seen
at <hi>Vienne, Limoges</hi> and <hi>Poictou.</hi>
               </q> It is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
to the world what complaints were
made in <hi>Germany</hi> after his time of the <hi>fraud</hi>
of <hi>Indulgences,</hi> before any other point of
<hi>Religion</hi> came into dispute; and how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
from this, the <hi>Popes</hi> authority came
to be questioned, that being the only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
they had to justifie them by: and with
what success these things were then mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
it is no more purpose to write now,
than to prove that it is day at Noon. The
<hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> could not but confess <hi>hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
abuses in the sale of Indulgences,</hi> yet
what amendment hath there been since that
time?<note place="margin">Bell. de In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulg. l. 1. c. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Bellarmin</hi> confesseth, <hi>that it were
better if the Church were very sparing in giving
Indulgences:</hi> I wonder why so; if my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:45050:280"/>
experience and observation be true,
<hi>that they prove great helps to devotion and
charity.</hi> Can the <hi>Church</hi> be too liberal in
those things which tend to so good an
end?</p>
            <p>§. 8. But <hi>Bellarmin would not have the people
too confident of the effect of Indulgences;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Of <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins</hi> pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</note> 
               <hi>for
though the Church may have power to give
them; yet they may want their effect in
particular persons; and therefore,</hi> saith he,
<hi>all prudent Christians do so receive Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences,
as withall to satisfie God themselves
for their sins, i. e.</hi> in plain terms, that all
<hi>prudent Christians</hi> are too wise to believe
them, and none but <hi>Fools</hi> do rely on them.
For if there were any thing but <hi>fraud</hi> and
<hi>imposture</hi> in them, why may not a <hi>prudent
Christian</hi> trust a Church which he believes
infallible? If the Head of the Church pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishes
an Indulgence, wherein he remits to
all that are confessed and contrite, upon
doing such actions of charity and piety
the remaining temporal punishment of their
sins: I desire to know why a <hi>prudent Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
of that <hi>Church</hi> may not, yea ought not
to rely upon his word? Doth he suspect
the <hi>Head</hi> of his <hi>Church</hi> may cheat and abuse
him? if he doth, what becomes of infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility?
if he verily believes that the <hi>Pope</hi>
cannot erre and will not deceive, why must
not his word be taken? and how can his
word be taken for the remitting of a debt,
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:45050:280"/>
when they take as much care of payment
as if he had said nothing? I know not
how those things pass among the <hi>prudent
Christians</hi> of that <hi>Church,</hi> but to me they
look like the greatest suspicion of a <hi>cheat</hi>
that may be. As suppose a great person
out of kindness to one that is in danger of
lying in Prison for debt, gives him a note
under his hand, that upon the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his debt to his Attourney, and
paying him his <hi>Fees,</hi> he will see his debt
wholly discharged; and a Friend of the
Prisoner tells him <hi>openly,</hi> he ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that Favour in an extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
with all thankfulness; for that person
is one who can never fail of his word;
and he need not question his ability for he
hath a vast <hi>treasure</hi> in his hands, to be
disposed of for such uses; can we other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
think, but that the poor man would
be strangely surprised with joy at it; and
if he hath any money left, he will be sure
to give it to the person imployed in so good
a work? But withall if he should <hi>secretly</hi>
whisper him, that he advises him as a Friend,
that he would look out all other wayes
imaginable to satisfie his Creditours, and
that all <hi>prudent persons</hi> in his case had taken
the same Course; what must the thoughts
of such a man be of such a large and noble
offer? Truly, that the Gentleman was a
great Courtier, but a man must have a care
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:45050:281"/>
of believing him too far; and his Friend
understood the world, and that one thing
was to be said and done in <hi>shew</hi> not to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige
so great a person, but for all that, a
man must mind his own business, or he may
be choused at last if he trust too far to such
large promises. This is just the case of
<hi>Indulgences</hi> in the <hi>Roman Church;</hi> a man is
affrighted with the dreadful Prison of <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,</hi>
as the temporal punishment of his
sins, which God will certainly exact from
him, either here by satisfactions and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
or there in the pains of that state;
while the man considers with himself the
hardness of his condition, he hears of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences</hi>
to be had; and after he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
the meaning of them is very well
satisfied, that if he can get one of them, he
shall do well enough. For he is told that
his <hi>Holiness</hi> is <hi>infallible,</hi> and that he cannot
cheat or lye, or deceive like other men,
and therefore of all persons in the world
he would soonest trust him; but because
many others are in the same condition with
him, he may a little question, whether his
<hi>stock</hi> will hold out or no: here his Friends
assure him the <hi>Treasure</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> (of
which the <hi>Pope</hi> hath the <hi>Keys)</hi> is so large,
that if it were a thousand times more, he
need not fear it; only he must confess his
sins and have contrition for them, and do
some charitable acts, and pay some custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:45050:281"/>
fees and duties, and he shall have a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
discharge. Well, sayes the man in a
transport of joy, this is the bravest <hi>Church</hi>
in the world for a man to <hi>sin</hi> in, if he may
escape thus: and what need I question,
since the <hi>Pope</hi> is <hi>infallible,</hi> and the treasury
of the <hi>Church</hi> is inexhaustible? how am I
freed now, not only from the fears of <hi>Hell</hi>
and <hi>Purgatory,</hi> but from crabbed and hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
penances? that honest and kind-hearted
Gentleman the <hi>Pope</hi> hath struck a <hi>tally</hi> for me
in his <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and I shall have my share in
my course and order; without lashings, and
whippings, and fastings, and mumblings, and
I know not how many odd tricks besides:
but <hi>soft and fair,</hi> saith <hi>Bellarmins</hi> prudent
<hi>Christian</hi> to him, be not too confident of
your ease and discharge, you must use as
great severities with your self, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe
as many penances, and say as many
Prayers as if you had no <hi>Indulgence</hi> at all.
Say you so, I pray what benefit then have I,
saith he, by this which you call an Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence?
what is it an Indulgence of? Is
there not a <hi>full remission of sins</hi> contained in it;
and I have been always told by that is meant
the discharge of the temporary punishment
due to sin either here or in Purgatory?
Shall I be discharged, or shall I not upon
it? if I shall, what do you tell me of that
which I am discharged from? if not, the
<hi>Indulgence</hi> is a <hi>spiritual Trapan,</hi> and the
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:45050:282"/>
               <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Infallible Cheat.</hi> I cannot see how
a man can think otherwise, that made such
account of the great benefit of <hi>Indulgences,</hi>
and at last finds they come to nothing but
deceiving the people and getting money.</p>
            <p>§. 9. By this we see already,<note place="margin">The absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the doctrine of Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the Churches Treasure.</note> what mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
shifts they are put to, who defend <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences</hi>
but as an <hi>honest contract,</hi> but they
who will justifie them as containing some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
divine and satisfactory for the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of mens sins, are fain to build the
doctrine of them upon such absurd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible
notions, that it is almost as hard
to understand as to believe it. It cannot
be denyed, that there are some in the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>Rome</hi> whose doctrine of <hi>Indulgences</hi> is
easie enough,<note place="margin">Cassander in consult. art. 12.</note> but then it marrs the whole
Markett,<note place="margin">Barns Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thol. Rom. Pacific. S. 9.</note> and this doctrine is therefore
condemned by others as <hi>heretical in sense.</hi>
Which is, that <hi>Indulgences</hi> are nothing else
but a <hi>relaxation of the ancient severity of
Church discipline,</hi>
               <note place="margin">White de medio anim. statu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dem. 26.</note> 
               <hi>according to the old Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential
Canons;</hi> which doth not respect
the justice of God, but the Discipline of the
<hi>Church</hi> over offenders. This is a doctrine
we have nothing to complain of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of understanding, but we know not
to what purpose, (if this be all) any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<hi>Indulgences</hi> are ever given, since
there is so general an <hi>Indulgence</hi> by the
practice of the whole <hi>Church</hi> among them,
wherein they cannot pretend to observe any
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:45050:282"/>
of the old <hi>Penitential Canons.</hi> And to
give a man an <hi>Indulgence</hi> to omit that,
which no body requires and is wholly out
of use, would be like the Kings giving a
man a <hi>Patent</hi> not to wear <hi>Trunk-hose</hi> and
<hi>Ruffs,</hi> when it would be ridiculous to use
them. And if this were all intended, why is
it not so expressed if they meant honestly?
but they know, if their <hi>Pardons</hi> ran so, no
one would give a farthing for them. What
need any talk of the <hi>Churches Treasure</hi> for
this? which <hi>Clement</hi> 6. made the ground
of <hi>Indulgences</hi> in his <hi>Bull:</hi> and hath been
asserted by the most zealous defenders of
them. This way of explaining <hi>Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
then, though it be easie and intelligible,
yet it is not reconcileable with the practice
of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor with the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
on which that practice is built. We
are therefore to enquire what they can make
of it, who go about to defend it as it is
practised and generally understood among
them. To this end they tell us, <q>that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the fault be remitted upon the
Sacrament of Penance, yet the temporal
punishment of sin remains, which God
must be satisfied for: that this temporal
punishment is either to be undergone here
or in <hi>Purgatory,</hi> that every man must
have undergone it himself, if there had
not been a <hi>treasure</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> made
up of the satisfactions of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:45050:283"/>
                  <hi>Saints,</hi> to make amends to <hi>God</hi> for every
one to whom that Treasure is applyed.
That, the dispensing of this Treasure is
in the hands of the <hi>Pope,</hi> who gives it out
by <hi>Indulgences,</hi> which being applyed to
any person upon the condition required,
he is thereby discharged from the debt of
temporal punishment which he owed to
God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is the received doctrine of <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences</hi>
in the <hi>Roman Church;</hi> which holds
together till you touch it, and then it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
flies in pieces like a <hi>Glass drop,</hi> or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes
into smoke and aire. It is of so ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a composition that it can endure no
rough handling; if you like it as it is,
much good may it do you, but you must
ask no <hi>Questions:</hi> But however I shall, to
shew the monstrous absurdities of this
Doctrine.</p>
            <p>1. Why if the <hi>Indulgence</hi> only respects the
<hi>punishment</hi> and not the <hi>fault,</hi> the terms of
the Indulgence do not express this, that the
people may not be deceived? Why in all
<hi>Indulgences</hi> since this doctrine is so explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as in the <hi>Iubilees</hi> of <hi>Clement</hi> 8.<note place="margin">Clem. 8. const. 58. To. 3. Bull. U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ban 8. const. 16. To. 4.</note> and of
<hi>Vrban</hi> 8. (the former of whom is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded
by <hi>Bellarmin</hi> for a reformer of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences)
the most general expressions are
still used of most <hi>plenary Indulgence, remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
and <hi>pardon of all their sins?</hi> why is it
not said only of the <hi>temporal punishment
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:45050:283"/>
due to sin,</hi> the fault being supposed to be
remitted?</p>
            <p>2. How <hi>punishment</hi> doth become
due, when the <hi>fault</hi> is remitted? if the <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment</hi>
be just, it must have respect to the
<hi>fault,</hi> for to <hi>punish</hi> without <hi>respect</hi> to the
<hi>fault,</hi> is all one as to <hi>punish</hi> without <hi>fault;</hi>
if it have respect to the <hi>fault,</hi> how that
fault can be said to be remitted which is
punished? So far as a man is punished, it
is nonsense to say he is pardoned, and so
far as he is not pardoned, his fault is charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon him.</p>
            <p>3. Suppose temporal punishment remain
to be satisfied for; whether all or only
some one kind? whether diseases, pains,
and death be not part of the <hi>temporal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment</hi>
of sin, and whether men may be
freed from these by <hi>Indulgences?</hi> whether
from the effects of the justice of <hi>God</hi> in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
judgements? if not, how can
a man be said to be freed from the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
punishment of sin that is as lyable to it
as any one else?</p>
            <p>4. If only one sort of the temporal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of sin, why is not that <hi>one sort</hi>
declared what it is, that all men may be
satisfied from the <hi>Pope</hi> himself, whom
some believe infallible, in his <hi>Indulgence?</hi>
Others we find are not agreed about it;
some say it is only the punishment due to
sin above the <hi>Canonical penance;</hi> some, that
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:45050:284"/>
it is only the <hi>Canonical penance</hi> and not that
which is due from the justice of <hi>God,</hi> some
that it is for both, some only for negligence
in performing penance, some that it is only
for injoyned penance, and others that it is
for all that may be enjoyned. In this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of opinions what security can any
man have what punishment he is to be freed
from?</p>
            <p>5. If it be from <hi>Canonical Penance</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a man is wholly freed from the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to that or no? if he be, what power
hath the <hi>Priest</hi> to enjoyne <hi>penance</hi> after?
if he be not free, what is it he is freed
from? and in what tolerable sense can this
be called a <hi>most full remission of sins,</hi> which
neither remits the <hi>fault,</hi> nor the <hi>natural</hi> or
<hi>divine punishment,</hi> nor so much as the <hi>Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Penance</hi> enjoyned by a <hi>Priest?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. Although there needs no <hi>treasure</hi>
where nothing is discharged; yet since so
great a one is spoken of for this purpose,
wherein the satisfaction of <hi>Christ</hi> bears the
greatest share; it were worth the enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
why the satisfaction of <hi>Christ</hi> might
not as well remit the temporal punishment
when the fault is remitted on the account
of it, as afterwards by <hi>Indulgences?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. How the parts of <hi>Christs</hi> satisfaction
come to be divided into that which was
<hi>necessary,</hi> and that which was <hi>redundant;</hi> so
as the necessary satisfies for the fault, and
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:45050:284"/>
the redundant for the temporal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
whether <hi>Christ</hi> did any more than
<hi>God</hi> required? whether any thing which <hi>God</hi>
required can be said to be redundant? if
there be, how one part comes to be applyed
and the other cast into a <hi>treasure?</hi> what
parts can be made of an infinite and entire
satisfaction? and if so little were necessary,
and so much redundant, how the least part
comes to satisfie for the fault and eternal
punishment; and the greatest only for the
temporal punishment?</p>
            <p>8. Whether all the satisfaction of <hi>Christ</hi>
taken together were not great enough to
remit the eternal punishment of the whole
world? if it were, whether all the <hi>redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant</hi>
parts of that, be cast into a <hi>treasure</hi>
too? and who hath the keeping of it, and
what <hi>use</hi> is made of so much more useful a
<hi>treasure</hi> than that which serves only to
remit the temporal punishment? What ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
can the <hi>Pope</hi> give of suffering so vast
a part of the <hi>Churches Treasure</hi> to lye idle
and make no use of it for the benefit of
those that need it?</p>
            <p>9. May not the <hi>Pope,</hi> if he thinks of it,
gather another mighty <hi>Treasure</hi> of the <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Power of God</hi> which is never used, as for
making new worlds, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> may he not by
the help of this deliver souls out of hell,
as well as by the other out of <hi>Purgatory?</hi>
and if this be so much the greater kindness,
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:45050:285"/>
he ought to think of it and imploy this
treasure for these purposes. Why may he
not think of another treasure of the <hi>light</hi>
of the <hi>Sun</hi> that is more than enough for
the use of the world, and to lay it up in
store for the benefit of the purblind and
Aged?</p>
            <p>10. If the satisfaction of <hi>Christ</hi> be so
redundant; how comes it not to be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for so poor an end as <hi>Indulgences</hi> serve
for; but the satisfactions of the <hi>Saints</hi>
must make up a share in this <hi>Treasure</hi> too?
Is not this worse, than to light a Candle
to help the Sun, to suppose <hi>Christs</hi> satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so infinite, as to be sufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
more worlds, and yet not enough
to deliver from temporal punishment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the satisfactions of the <hi>Saints?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>11. How come the <hi>Saints</hi> to make such
large satisfactions to the <hi>justice</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> if
the <hi>satisfaction</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> were of so infinite
a nature? and if they did make satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
were they not sufficiently rewarded
for them? if they were, how come those
satisfactions to help others which they were
so abundantly recompensed for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?</p>
            <p>12. If the satisfaction of <hi>Christ</hi> doth
only obtain grace for the <hi>Saints</hi> to satisfie
themselves for the temporal punishment of
their sins; how can the application of
this satisfaction by <hi>Indulgences</hi> free any
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:45050:285"/>
from the temporal punishment of their sins?
Or have the satisfactions of <hi>Saints</hi> being
joyned with <hi>Christs</hi> greater power now in
common penitents, than the satisfaction of
<hi>Christ</hi> alone in the greatest <hi>Saints?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>13. Why the satisfaction of <hi>Christ</hi> may
not serve, without the <hi>Saints</hi> to remit only
the temporal punishment of sins; when it
was sufficient alone to remit both eternal
and temporal in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Baptism?</hi>
or was the force of it spent then, that it
needs a fresh supply afterwards? but if
then it could be applyed to a higher end,
without any other help, why not where it
is to have far less efficacy?</p>
            <p>14. If satisfaction be made to <hi>God</hi> for
the temporal punishment of penitents by
<hi>Indulgences;</hi> I desire to know when and
by whom the <hi>payment</hi> is made to <hi>God?</hi>
If it was made by the persons whose satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions
make the <hi>Churches</hi> treasure, for
that end, what hath the <hi>Pope</hi> to do to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spense
that which <hi>God</hi> hath accepted long
agoe for payment? If it be made by the
<hi>Pope,</hi> in what way doth he make it? doth
he take out so much ready <hi>cash</hi> of the
<hi>Churches</hi> treasure and pay it down upon
the nail, according to the proportion of
every ones sins? or doth he only tell <hi>God</hi>
where such a <hi>treasure</hi> lyes and bid him
go and satisfie himself, for as much as he
discharges of his d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>bt?</p>

               <pb n="524" facs="tcp:45050:286"/>
15. How came this <hi>Treasure</hi> of the
<hi>Church</hi> into the <hi>Popes</hi> Keeping? who gave
him alone the <hi>Keys</hi> of it? if there were
any such thing, methinks those who are
trusted with the greater treasure of <hi>Christs
necessary</hi> satisfaction for the remitting of
eternal punishment, as every <hi>Priest</hi> is by their
own doctrine in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Penance:</hi>
should not be denyed the lesser of the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities</hi>
of <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Saints</hi> suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
for the remitting only temporal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.
When I once see these questions
satisfactorily answered, I may then think
better of this doctrine than I doe at present;
for the best I can think of it now is, that
there never was a doctrine more absurd in
the ground of it, or more gainful in the
practice than this of <hi>Indulgences</hi> in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church;</hi> and therefore ought to be
accounted one of the most notorious <hi>cheats</hi>
that ever was in the <hi>Christian</hi> world.</p>
            <p>§. 10. But let us suppose it otherwise,<note place="margin">The ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences to hinder de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</note>
and then we are to enquire, whether this
would tend to promote or obstruct that
very way of devotion, which is most in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
in the <hi>Roman Church?</hi> there are but
two ways to judge of this, either by <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi>
or the <hi>nature of the doctrine</hi> it self.
For <hi>experience</hi> my Adversary alledges <hi>his
own,</hi> and <hi>that he hath seen great devotion
caused by them:</hi> but by his favour the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is not, what outward acts of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:45050:286"/>
may be performed by some ignorant
and silly people, who are abused by great
hopes of strange benefits by <hi>Indulgences,</hi>
and therefore prepare themselves with some
shew of devotion to receive them especially
when they are unusual; but the question is,
whether they have these effects upon those
who understand the nature and designe of
them and the doctrine of their <hi>Church</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them.<note place="margin">D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<hi>the validity of the Indulgence doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend

in it, which is, that whosoever doth such a
thing, as going to the 7. Churches, shall
have plenary remission of his sins; therefore</hi>
saith he, <hi>whoever doth the thing, shall have

the Indulgence is false.</hi> And to his <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi>
I shall oppose, that of greater ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servers

have already mentioned the testimony of
<hi>Vrspergensis</hi> and others concerning the effects
of plenary Indulgences in their times, how
men encouraged themselves to sin the more
because of them.<note place="margin">Polyd, virg. de invent. rer. l. 8. c. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Polydore Virgil</hi> observes,

committing no kind of sin, when at so cheap
a rate they could purchase a remission of them.</hi>
But setting aside the experience of these
things, let us consider what the nature of
the doctrine it self tends to, to those who
believe it. The least benefit we see allowed
them is a freedom from <hi>enjoyned penances;</hi>
and what are these <hi>penances</hi> accounted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, but <hi>fruits of true repentance,</hi>
a severe mortification, fasting, frequent
prayers and Almes? so that the short of
this doctrine is, that men by <hi>Indulgences</hi>
are excused from doing the best parts of
their <hi>Religion,</hi> and if this be a way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
devotion I leave any one in his
senses to judge.</p>
            <p>§. 11. I proceed now to <hi>the denying the
Cup to the Laity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in one kind.</note> contrary to the practice of
the <hi>Church</hi> in the solemn celebration of
the Eucharist for a thousand years after
Christ. To which he answers 3. ways (1)
<hi>that the receiving in one or both kinds was
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:45050:287"/>
ever held a matter of liberty in the Church.</hi>
(2) <hi>that it was as much in the Churches
power to alter it after a 1000. years, as in
the first or second century.</hi> (3) <hi>that the believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whole Christ to be present in one kind
tends more to excite devotion than receiving
both elements without that belief.</hi> This is
the substance of his answer.<note place="margin">Vindication of Arch-Bishop Land. Part. 3. ch. 3. 8. 14. 15. 16. 17.</note> But I have
else where at large proved, and need not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
it here, that the Institution of Christ,
as to both kinds, was of an universally obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
nature, not only from the will of
the first Institutor, but from the universal
sense of the <hi>Church</hi> concerning the nature
of that Institution. And there I have large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
answer'd those very testimonies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by him, and shewed that they are
so far from proving the use of one kind in
the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> that <hi>Leo</hi> in that very
place shewes, that <hi>it was the token of an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick
not to receive in both kinds;</hi> and the
other Instance in the <hi>Greek Church</hi> is only
of a woman in whose mouth the bread
turned into a <hi>stone,</hi> that she had not pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
to stay to receive the <hi>Cup.</hi> So very
pittyful are the proofs brought against the
use of both kinds for a 1000. years after
<hi>Christ,</hi> which being supposed and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by some of the most learned and
ingenuous of their own <hi>Church,</hi> I wonder
what authority the <hi>Church</hi> afterwards can
have to alter, what was always looked on
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:45050:288"/>
before as an obliging <hi>Institution</hi> of <hi>Christ?</hi>
Might it not as well alter any other <hi>Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi>
on the same grounds? and wholly
forbid the bread to the Laity as well as
the cup; and I doe not at all question but
as substantial reasons might be brought for
one as the other. I had thought the <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> had pretended a
mighty reverence to <hi>Apostolical Traditions,</hi>
and the <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi>
for a <hi>thousand</hi> years after <hi>Christ.</hi> But it
seems this signifies nothing to them, when
it is contrary to their present doctrine and
practice. Then it makes <hi>a great noise</hi> as
he saith but nothing else: Thus we <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi>
have at last gained <hi>Antiquity</hi> of our
side, it is now yielded that though the
<hi>Church</hi> were for us, for a <hi>thousand</hi> years,
yet if it now decree or act otherwise, this
is enough for them. And we are content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>his Apostles</hi> and all
the <hi>Primitive practice,</hi> for so long a time
on our side; and to leave them to enjoy
the satisfaction that follows, taking the part
of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> against them all.
But however <hi>their opinion tends more to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion?</hi>
Alas for us! we doe not account
it any piece of devotion to believe non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense,
and contradictions such as the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of transubstantiation implies: we
know not what devotion there can be in
opposing a plain Institution of <hi>Christ,</hi> and
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:45050:288"/>
not meerly in leaving the people at liberty
to receive in one or both kinds, but in
<hi>prohibiting</hi> the far greatest part of <hi>Christians</hi>
to receive as <hi>Christ</hi> appointed; we know
not what devotion there can lye in worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
a piece of bread for the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God;</hi>
and believing that when a wafer is taken
into our mouths, <hi>that God himself is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally
entered under our Roof.</hi> O horrible
devotion and detestable superstition! to
give the same adoration to a <hi>wafer</hi> which
we doe to the <hi>Eternal God;</hi> and to believe
<hi>Christ</hi> to goe down as personally into our
bellies, as ever he went up and down when
he was upon earth.</p>
            <p>§. 12. That which followes is,<note place="margin">Of the Popes power of dispensing.</note> 
               <hi>the
Power of a Persons dispensing in oaths and
marriages contrary to the Law of God,</hi> which
I therefore made a hindrance of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
of devotion because it is apt to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess
mens minds with an apprehension
that Religion is only a <hi>Politick Cheat,</hi> if
any person shall be thought able to dispense
with those things which are universally
received among <hi>Christians</hi> as the <hi>Laws</hi> of
<hi>God.</hi> That which I meant, was the <hi>Popes</hi>
taking upon him to dispense with <hi>oaths</hi> of
<hi>allegiance</hi> to <hi>Princes,</hi> and the <hi>incestuous
marriages</hi> of some great <hi>Princes.</hi> And now
let any one consider what his Answer signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies:
he saith, <hi>that some kinds of oaths may
be judged in some circumstances to be hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:45050:289"/>
and not fit to be kept: and the dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in them is no more than to judge or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
them to be so: and for Marriages,</hi> he
addes that <hi>the Church may dispense in some
degrees of Affinity and consanguinity, but in
nothing contrary to the Law of God.</hi> But this
doth not at all reach to the busines; for
dispensing in this way may as well be done
by a <hi>Casuist</hi> as the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> but
the Question lyes here, whether those
things which otherwise would be sins by
the Law of God, doe therefore cease to be
so, because of the <hi>Popes</hi> Power to discharge
that obligation of conscience which lay
upon the Person, either in oaths or mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages?
Let him answer directly to this;
for the other is shuffling and not answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
As, it is granted that a subject hath
an obligation of conscience upon him to
obey his Soveraigne by vertue of the <hi>Law</hi>
of <hi>God;</hi> and the universal sense of the
<hi>Church</hi> hath been that there are some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of consanguinity and Affinity which
it is <hi>Incest</hi> to marry within: I desire to
know whether the <hi>Popes</hi> power can make
disobedience <hi>lawful</hi> in one case and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
in another, which without that
<hi>Power</hi> were utterly unlawful? This he
could not but know was the thing meant,
but not fit to be answered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="531" facs="tcp:45050:289"/>
§. 13. The last Instance is,<note place="margin">The ill conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of asserting marriage in a Priest to be worse than Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> 
               <hi>making dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
to the Church in disputable matters,
more hainous than disobedience to the Laws
of Christ in unquestionable things, as mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
in a Priest to be a greater crime than
Fornication. To this he answers. 1. That
the Law of the Church being supposed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding
the marriage of a Priest, that is no
disputable matter: but it is out of Question
by the Law of God, that obedience is to be
given to the commands or prohibitions of the
Church. 2. That marriage in a Priest, the
prohibition of the Church being supposed and
a voluntary vow against it, is no better than
Adultery in the language of the Fathers, and
therefore worse than Fornication. 3. That
the state of single life is much more convenient
for Priests, than the married state is.</hi> This
last answer is nothing at all to the purpose,
for in matters of conveniency not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
by any Law, every one is left to
be his own chooser; but the case I put,
was not between a <hi>married life</hi> and <hi>single
life,</hi> for we know no harm, either in one
or the other of these, but every one is to
judge as most tends to the comfort of his
life and the ends of his calling; which hath
now far different circumstances from the
<hi>Apostolical</hi> times, which is a sufficient ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to the <hi>Apostles</hi> words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 32.
having a particular respect to the state of
the <hi>Christian Church</hi> in that time of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixedness
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:45050:290"/>
and persecution: but the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
was between <hi>marriage</hi> in a <hi>Priest</hi>
and <hi>Fornication,</hi> whether the former were
not by them made a greater crime than
the latter, and whether this were not
dishonour to the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> to make
the breach of a constitution of the <hi>Church,</hi>
in a matter left at liberty by the <hi>Law</hi> of
<hi>Christ,</hi> a greater crime than the violation
of an indisputable <hi>Law</hi> of his? And <hi>S. Paul</hi>
hath given a general rule which equally
holds in all ages of the <hi>Church, If they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
contain let them marry,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 9.</note> 
               <hi>for it is better
to marry than to burn.</hi> So that if <hi>S. Paul</hi>
may resolve the case he makes no question,
that where there is but danger of <hi>Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
marriage</hi> is so far from being a
greater crime than that, that it becomes
a <hi>duty</hi> to such a one. <hi>But hold,</hi> say they of
the Church of Rome to <hi>S. Paul, this is
only meant of those whom the Church allowes
to marry, but if the Church once forbid it
to any they are not to marry, let their case
be what it will.</hi> Here then lyes the dispute
between <hi>S. Paul</hi> and them; <hi>S. Paul</hi> saith,
<hi>to avoid fornication a man ought to marry;</hi>
they say, that to marry after the prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Church</hi> is worse than Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<hi>S. Paul</hi> might it may be ask, <hi>what
authority their Church had to determin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to what he had done in this case; Or
men to make vows,</hi> against the most proper
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:45050:290"/>
remedy of some of the Infirmities of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature, and which <hi>God</hi> hath not
promised to any to keep them from: If
obedience to the <hi>Church</hi> be indisputable, it
is only in such things which <hi>God</hi> hath not
antecedently determin'd by his own <hi>Law;</hi>
but in the case between <hi>marriage</hi> and <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
God</hi> himself hath given a <hi>Law</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hand, which no <hi>Church</hi> in the world
can reverse. And however indifferent a
thing in the general it be to marry or not,
yet when it comes to that point, either
<hi>marriage</hi> or <hi>Fornication,</hi> I wonder at the
confidence of any, who dare upon any
account whatsoever, make <hi>marriage</hi> a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
crime than <hi>Fornication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But,</hi> he saith, <hi>it seems strange to them
who either cannot or will not take the word of
Christ, that is his counsel of chastity, that
marriage in a Priest should be a greater sin
than Fornication.</hi> It doth, I assure you
seem strange to us, because we are desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to keep the <hi>Commands</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and
we are sure <hi>marriage</hi> is against none of
them, but <hi>Fornication</hi> is. Doth that man
<hi>take Christs counsel of chastity,</hi> that rather
chooses to commit <hi>Fornication</hi> than <hi>marry?</hi>
What admirable <hi>chastity</hi> is that? and what
a beastly institution must marriage be, if
<hi>Fornication</hi> be a less <hi>crime</hi> than that? But
what a reflection is this the mean while,
on the <hi>author</hi> of it, and that <hi>state</hi> of <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency</hi>
               <pb n="534" facs="tcp:45050:291"/>
and purity wherein it was first appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
They must needs think themselves very
holy men, who look on that state as too
impure for them, which was allotted to
man in his greatest <hi>Innocency.</hi> But although
the first <hi>Ages</hi> of the <hi>Christian Church</hi> were
so full of hardship and difficulties, that if
ever it should have been required of the
<hi>Governours</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> to have been
above this <hi>state,</hi> it should have been at that
time; yet we find no such thing in the
<hi>Apostolical</hi> times or afterwards, when the
necessities of affairs would most have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
it. But when the <hi>Christian Church</hi>
came to have settlement in the world, and
by degrees persons were fixed with endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to particular places, and some care
of affaires of the world was necessarily
joyned with those of the <hi>Church;</hi> there
was far less reason to make such a prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of marriage to the <hi>Clergy</hi> than ever
was before. And the <hi>scandals</hi> were so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable
where those restraints were most
in force, that on that very account the
wisest men (though as fond as any of the
<hi>Churches</hi> authority) thought there was
more reason to give liberty to <hi>Priests</hi> to
marry, than ever there had been to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
them from it. I am not bound to
defend all the extravagant and indiscreet
passages which fell from some of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
concerning <hi>marriage;</hi> but I am sure
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:45050:291"/>
the <hi>Church</hi> preserved her liberty in it not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
them, as I might easily prove
if it were suitable to my present designe.

<pb n="537" facs="tcp:45050:292"/>
this <hi>Council,</hi> that he should herein op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
what he had said elsewhere; for he
determins, <hi>that the marrying again of the
widdows that had vowed continuance in that
state was no Adultery, but a lawful marriage;
and that husband and wife ought not to be
separated from each other upon such mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,<note place="margin">August. de bono vidui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat. c. 9. 10. 11.</note>
and by that means make the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
truely Adulterers, when they sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from them and marry other wives: and
therefore,</hi> saith he, <hi>that which the Apostle
condemns in them, is not so much their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
as their will to marry whether they doe
or no, whereby they break their first faith,</hi>
So that it is not <hi>marriage</hi> but <hi>lust</hi> which the
<hi>Apostle</hi> condemns; from whence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
that <hi>S. Austin</hi> could never, if he
spake consonantly to himself, condemn
<hi>marriage</hi> after a vow of continency to be
worse than <hi>Fornication.</hi> Indeed, he saith,
<hi>that this falling from that holy chastity which
was vowed to God, may in some sense be
said to be worse than Adultery;</hi> but he
never imagined such a construction could
be made of his words, as though the act
of <hi>Fornication</hi> were not a greater <hi>falling

§. 14. The 3. argument I used to prove
the danger a person runs of his <hi>salvation</hi>
in the <hi>communion</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of faith in the Roman Church.</note>
was because <hi>it exposeth the faith of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
to so great uncertainties;</hi> which he
looks <hi>on as a strange charge from the Pen of
a Protestant.</hi> As <hi>strange</hi> as it is, I have at
large proved it <hi>true</hi> in a full examination
of the whole Controversie of the <hi>Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of faith</hi> between us and them;<note place="margin">Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Arch-Bishop Laud <hi>part. 1. ch.</hi> 5. 6. 7. 8 9.</note> to which
I expect a particular Answer before this
charge be renewed again. To which I
must refer him for the main proof of it,
and shall here subjoyn only short replyes
to his Answers; or references to what is
fully answered already.</p>
            <p>1. His distinction <hi>of the authority of the
Scripture in it self and to us,</hi> signifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
for when we enquire into the
proofs of the Authority of <hi>Scripture,</hi> it
can be understood no otherwise than in
respect <hi>to us;</hi> and if the <hi>Scriptures Authority</hi>
as <hi>to us</hi> is to be proved by the <hi>Church,</hi> and
the <hi>Churches Authority</hi> as <hi>to us</hi> to be prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the <hi>Scripture,</hi> the difficulty is not
in the least avoided by that distinction.
And as little to the purpose is the other,
<hi>that it is only an argument ad hominem, to
prove the Infallibility of the Church from
Scriptures,</hi> for I would fain know upon
what other grounds they build their own
belief of the <hi>Churches Infallibility</hi> than on
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:45050:293"/>
the <hi>Promises</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> in the <hi>Scripture?</hi>
These are miserable evasions and nothing
else. For the trite saying of <hi>S. Austin,
that he would not believe the Gospel,</hi> &amp;c. I
have at large proved that the meaning of
it is no more than that the <hi>Testimony</hi> of the
<hi>Vniversal Church</hi> from the <hi>Apostles</hi> times
is the best way to prove the particular
books of <hi>Scripture,</hi>
               <note place="margin">c. 7. sect. 9.</note> to <hi>be authentical</hi> and
cannot be understood of the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of
the <hi>present Church;</hi> and that the testimony
of some few persons as the <hi>Manichees</hi> were
was not to be taken in opposition to the
whole <hi>Christian Church.</hi> Which is a thing
we as much contend for as they; but is
far enough from making the <hi>Infallibility</hi>
of our faith, to depend on the <hi>Authority</hi>
of the present <hi>Church;</hi> which we say is the
way to overthrow all certainty of faith to
any considering man.</p>
            <p>2. To that of overthrowing the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of sense in the doctrine of <hi>transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation;</hi>
he saith, <hi>that divine revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ought to be believed against the evidence of
sense.</hi> To which I answer (1.) that divine
revelation in matters not capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
judged by our <hi>senses,</hi> is to be believed
notwithstanding any argument can be
drawn from sensible experiments against it;
as in the belief of <hi>God,</hi> the doctrine of the
<hi>Trinity,</hi> the future state of the soul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
(2.) that in the proper objects of sense to
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:45050:294"/>
suppose a <hi>Revelation</hi> contrary to the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of sense, is to overthrow all cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of faith where the matters to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
depend upon matters of fact. As
for Instance, the truth of the whole <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
doctrine</hi> depends upon the truth of
<hi>Christs</hi> resurrection from the dead: if sense
be not here to be believed in a proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of it, what assurance can we have
that the <hi>Apostles</hi> were not deceived, when
they said they saw <hi>Christ</hi> after he was
risen?</p>
            <p>If it be said <hi>there was no revelation against
sense in that case:</hi> that doth not take off
the difficulty, for the reason why I am to
believe <hi>revelation</hi> at any time against sense
must be, because sense may be deceived,
but revelation cannot; but if I yield to that
principle that sense may be deceived in its
most proper object, we can have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
certainty by sense at all, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
not in that point, that <hi>Christ</hi> is
risen from the dead. If it be said, <hi>that
sense cannot be deceived, where there is no
revelation against it:</hi> I desire to know how
it comes to be deceived supposing a revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
contrary to it? Doth <hi>God</hi> impose up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our senses at that time? then he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deceives us; is it by telling us we ought
to believe more than we see? that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
not: but we desire only to believe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our senses in what we doe see;
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:45050:294"/>
as what we see to be bread, that is bread;
that what the <hi>Apostles</hi> saw to be the body
of <hi>Christ</hi> was the <hi>body</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> really, and
substantially, and not meerly the accidents
of a body. Besides, if revelation is to be
believed against sense; then either that reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
is conveyed immediately to our minds,
which is to make every one a Prophet that
believes transubstantiation; or mediately
by our senses, as in those words <hi>this is
my body:</hi> if so, than I am to believe this
revelation by my senses, and believing this
revelation, I am not to believe my senses:
which is an excellent way of making faith
certain. All this on supposition there were
a revelation in this case, which is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
false, but if it were true would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the certainty of faith.</p>
            <p>3. To that I objected, as to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
to men the use of their judgement
and reason as to the matters of faith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by a Church, when they must use
it in the choice of a Church; he answers,
<hi>that this cannot expose faith to any uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
because it is only preferring the
Churches judgement before our own:</hi> but
he doth not seem to understand the force
of my objection which lay in this. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one must use his own judgement and
reason in the choice of the <hi>Church</hi> he is
to rely upon; is he certain in this or not?
if he be uncertain, all that he receives on
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:45050:295"/>
the <hi>Authority</hi> of that <hi>Church</hi> must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
too: if the use of reason be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
then how comes the <hi>Authority</hi> of a
<hi>Church</hi> to be a necessary means of certainty
in matters of faith? And they who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the use of a mans reason and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in <hi>Religion</hi> must overthrow all cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
on their own grounds, since the
choice of his <hi>Infallible Guide</hi> must depend
upon it. Now he understands my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
better, he may know better how to
answer it: but I assure him I meant no
such thing by the use of reason, <hi>as he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
I would have, which is to believe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but what my reason can comprehend;</hi>
for I believe an Infinite Being, and all the
Doctrines revealed by it in <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
although I cannot reconcile all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
concerning them to those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
we call reason. But therefore to
argue against the use of mens judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in matters of faith, and the grounds
of believing, is to dispute against that,
which all wise men ever did, and will do
to the worlds end.</p>
            <p>4. I proved they made faith uncertain,
by making the <hi>Churches</hi> power to extend to
the making new articles of faith. This he
grants <hi>to be to the purpose, if it were true:
but</hi> he saith, <hi>the Church never owned any
such power in her General Councils,</hi> (which
doth not hinder but that the <hi>Heads</hi> of their
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:45050:295"/>
               <hi>Church</hi> have pretended to it and in case it be
disputable among them, whether the <hi>Pope</hi>
be not <hi>infallible,</hi> that unavoidably leaves
faith at uncertainties.) Yet he yields what
I contend for, which is, <hi>that it is in the
Churches Power to make that necessary to be
believed which was not so before:</hi> for whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be <hi>by inventing new Articles,</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
more explicitely the Truths not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in Scripture and Tradition;</hi> it is all
one to my purpose, as long as men might
be saved without believing them before and
cannot afterwards; which is to make the
conditions of salvation <hi>mutable</hi> according
to the pleasure of the <hi>Church;</hi> which is the
greatest inconveniency of inventing <hi>new
doctrines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. I shewed, they made faith uncertain
by pretending to infallibility in determining
Controversies, and yet not using it to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
those which are on foot among
themselves. The force of the argument
did not lye in this as he imagines, <hi>as though
faith could not be certain, unless all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
were determined,</hi> which was far
from my thoughts, but that pretending
there can be no faith without <hi>infallibility</hi> in
their <hi>Church</hi> to end Controversies, they
should give such great occasion to suspect
that they did not believe themselves by
imploying that <hi>Infallibility</hi> in ending the
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:45050:296"/>
great Controversies among themselves; of
which I have spoken already, and to this he
gives no answer at all.</p>
            <p>Thus much in Vindication of the third
Argument, I made use of to prove, that
all those who are in the Communion of
the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> do run so great a hazard
of their salvation, that none who have a
care of their souls ought to embrace or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in it.</p>
            <p>§. 15. <hi>I now come to the third answer
to the first Question,<note place="margin">The case of a revolter and a bred Papist compared.</note> which was,</hi> that a
Protestant leaving the Communion of our
Church, doth incurre a greater guilt, than one
who was bred up in the communion of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and continues therein by
invincible Ignorance, and therefore cannot
equally be saved with such a one. <hi>Three
things he objects against this Answer.</hi>
1. That this makes them both damned,
though unequally, because the Converted Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
more deeply than he that was bred so.
2. That this reflects as much upon St. <hi>Austin</hi>
as them, who rejected the Communion of the
<hi>Manichees,</hi> and embraced that of the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> upon their grounds. 3. That it is
contrary to our distinction of points funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
and not fundamental. <hi>To which I
Reply:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That the design of my Answer was
not to pass the sentence of damnation on
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:45050:296"/>
all who dye in the communion of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church;</hi> but to shew that they who
forsook a <hi>better Church</hi> for it do <hi>incurre
greater guils,</hi> than those who are alwayes
<hi>bred up</hi> in it and live and dye in the belief of
its being the <hi>true Church,</hi> and therefore are
not in an <hi>equal capacity of salvation</hi> with
them. I shall make my meaning more
plain by a parallel Instance or two; many
in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> have asserted the
possibility of the <hi>Salvation</hi> of <hi>Heathens</hi>
(though some <hi>Bigots</hi> have denyed it to
<hi>Protestants)</hi> suppose this question were put
concerning two persons: <hi>Whether a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
having the same motives to become a
Heathen, which one bred and born and well
grounded in Heathenism hath to remain in it,
may not equally be saved in the profession of
it?</hi> and a third person should answer,
<hi>that a Christian leaving the communion of
the Christian Church doth incurre a greater
guilt, than one who was bred up in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenism
and continues therein by invincible
Ignorance:</hi> doth this answer imply that
they <hi>must both be damned though equally?</hi>
or rather doth it not yield a greater pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
of salvation to one than to the
other? Or suppose, (to come nearer our
case) the question were put, concerning
one that <hi>revolted</hi> from the <hi>Church of Iudah</hi>
to the <hi>ten Tribes,</hi> (which were guilty of
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:45050:297"/>
               <hi>Idolatry,</hi> though not of the highest kind,)
whether he were equally capable of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with one who was <hi>bred up</hi> in the
communion of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> all his
dayes? I should make no question to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
his condition more dangerous than
the other; &amp; yet not therein <hi>damn them both,</hi>
but only imply that it was much harder for
to escape than the other. For he that was
bred up in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> believing
it was the true <hi>God</hi> he served, and in a right
manner, and looking on the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>
as a <hi>Schismatical Church,</hi> and seeing
the greater number of Tribes on their side,
and wanting that instruction which was in
the <hi>Church of Iudah,</hi> might in the since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of his heart serve <hi>God</hi> in a false way,
and pray to him to pardon all his errours
and corruptions, and have a general repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of all sins, though not particularly
convinced of the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the <hi>ten Tribes,</hi>
I dare not say, but <hi>God</hi> will accept of such
a one <hi>that thus fears God and works Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi>
in the simplicity of his heart:
but I cannot say the same of one who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volts
from <hi>Iudah,</hi> where the <hi>true God</hi> was
worshipped in a <hi>true manner,</hi> where he had
sufficient means of instruction, and either
wilful Ignorance, or temporal ends, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
prejudices makes him deliberate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
choose a worse and more impure <hi>Church</hi>
               <pb n="547" facs="tcp:45050:297"/>
before a better, for that very sin makes
his case much more dangerous than the
other. Our business is not to enquire into
the <hi>salvation</hi> or <hi>damnation</hi> of any <hi>particular
persons;</hi> for that depends upon so many
circumstances as to the aggravation or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuation
of their faults, the nature and
sincerity of their repentance, the integrity
and simplicity of their minds; which none
but <hi>God</hi> himself can know: but to find out
the <hi>truest way to salvation,</hi> and to reject
whatever <hi>Church</hi> requires that which is in
it self sinful; for though <hi>God</hi> may pardon
those who live in it in the simplicity of
their minds, yet their hopes lying in their
<hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>repentance,</hi> none who have
a care of their souls dare venture them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in so hazardous a state. Setting
aside then the consideration of the danger
common to both, I say the case of a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volter</hi>
from us to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is
much worse than of one who was alwayes
bred up in it, because he might far more
easily understand the danger he runs into,
and wilfull <hi>Ignorance</hi> only keeps him from
it, and he doth upon deliberation choose a
state of infinite hazard before one of the
greatest safety.</p>
            <p>2. This doth not reflect on St. <hi>Austin</hi> or
the <hi>Church</hi> in his time, which was as far
different from theirs as the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>
               <pb n="548" facs="tcp:45050:298"/>
and <hi>Israel</hi> were from each other: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can it destroy the <hi>distinction of Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals
and not Fundamentals,</hi> for the <hi>possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>
of <hi>salvation</hi> allowed to any in their
<hi>Church</hi> is built upon the supposition that
they have all that is <hi>fundamentally necessary</hi>
in order to it, though there are many
dangerous errours and corruptions in
that <hi>Church</hi> whose communion they
live in.</p>
            <p>§. 16. The Answers to the first Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
being thus vindicated;<note place="margin">The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the Roman Church considered.</note> there remains
little to be added concerning the second.
For he tells me, <hi>that he agrees so far with
me, that every Christian is bound to choose
the communion of the purest Church. But
which that Church is must be seen by the
grounds it brings to prove the doctrines it
teaches, to have been delivered by Christ and
his Apostles.</hi> And to be even with him, I
thus far agree with him in the way of
proof of a <hi>Churches purity, viz.</hi> by agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with the doctrine of <hi>Christ</hi> and his
<hi>Apostles;</hi> and that that Church is to be
judged purest which shews the greatest evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of that consent; and <hi>that every one is
bound to enquire which Church hath the
strongest Motives for it and to embrace the
communion of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being thus far agreed, I must now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into what <hi>motives</hi> he offers on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:45050:298"/>
of their <hi>Church;</hi> and what method
he prescribes for delivering ours. For the
former, he produces <hi>a large Catalogue of
Catholick Motives</hi> (as he calls them) <hi>in
the words of Dr.</hi> Taylour, <hi>Liberty of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
Sect.</hi> 20. And I do not know a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
way of answering them, than in the
words of the same eminent and learned
Person, which he uses upon a like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to his demonstrating Friend <hi>I. S.</hi>
               <q>But now in my Conscience,<note place="margin">Preface to the second part of his dissuasive.</note> (saith the
<hi>Bishop)</hi> this was unkindly done, that
when I had spoken for them what I
could, and more than I knew they had
ever said for themselves, and yet to save
them harmless from the iron hands of a
tyrant and unreasonable power, to keep
them from being persecuted for their
errours and opinions, that they should
take the arms I had lent them for their
defence, and throw them at my head.
But the best of it is, though <hi>I. S.</hi> be
unthankful, yet the Weapons themselves
are but wooden Daggers, intended only
to represent how the poor men are
couzened by themselves, and that under
fair and fraudulent pretences even pious
well meaning men, men wise enough in
other things may be abused. And
though what I said, was but tinsel and
pretence, imagery and whipt Cream, yet
I could not be blamed to use no better
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:45050:299"/>
than the best their cause could bear:
yet if that be the best they have to say
for themselves, their probabilities will
be soon out-ballanced by one Scripture-testimony
urged by Protestants, and <hi>thou
shalt not Worship any graven Images</hi> will
out-weigh all the best and fairest imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of their Church.—But then <hi>I. S.</hi>
might, if he had pleased, have considered,
that I did not intend to make that harangue
to represent that the Roman Religion had
probabilities of being true, but probabilities
that the Religion might be tolerated, or
might be endured: and if I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it was but a well meant errour,
hereafter they shall speak for themselves,
only for their comfort, this they might
have also observed in that Book, that
there is not half so much excuse for the
Papists, as there is for the Anabaptists,
and yet it was but an excuse at the best.
But since from me, saith he, they bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
their light Armour, which is not
Pistol-proof; from me if they please
they may borrow a remedy to undeceive
them, and that in the same kind and
way of arguing;</q> for which he referrs
to a letter written by him to a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
seduced to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi>
out of which I shall transcribe so much
as may over-ballance the probabilities
produced elsewhere by him.</p>

You are now gone to a Church
that protects it self by arts of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlety
and arms, by violence and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
all that are not of their minds:
to a Church in which you are to be a
subject of the King so long as it
pleases the Pope: In which you may
be absolved from your Vows made to
God, your Oaths to the King, your
Promises to Men, your Duty to your
Parents in some cases: a Church in
which men Pray to God and to Saints
in the same Form of words in which
they Pray to God, as you may see in
the Offices of Saints, and particularly
of our Lady; a Church in which men
are taught by most of the principal
Leaders to Worship Images with the
same Worship with which they Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God or Christ, or him or her,
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:45050:300"/>
whose Image it is, and in which they
usually picture God the Father and the
Holy Trinity to the great dishonour of
that Sacred mystery, against the doctrine
and practice of the primitive Church,
against the express doctrine of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
against the honour of, a divine
Attribute; I mean the immensity and
spirituality of the divine nature: You
are gone to a Church that pretends to be
infallible, and yet is infinitely deceived
in many particulars, and yet endures
no contradiction, and is impatient her
Children should enquire into any thing
her Priests obtrude. You are gone
from receiving the whole Sacrament
to receive it but half, from Christs
Institution to a human Invention, from
Scripture to uncertain Traditions, and
from ancient Tradition to new pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
from Prayers which ye under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
to Prayers which ye understand
not, from confidence in God to rely
upon Creatures, from intire dependance
upon inward-acts, to a dangerous tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
of resting too much in outward
ministeries in the external work of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
and Sacramentals. You are
gone from a Church whose Worshipping
is simple, Christian and Apostolical, to
a Church where mens Consciences are
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:45050:300"/>
loaden with a burden of Ceremonies,
greater than that in the dayes of the
Jewish Religion (for the Ceremonial of
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a great Book in
Folio.) You are gone from a Church
where you were exhorted to read the
Word of God, the Holy Scriptures, from
whence you sound instruction, institution,
comfort, reproof, a treasure of all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies,
to a Church that seals up
that Fountain from you, and gives you
drink by drops out of such Cisterns as
they first make and then stain and then
reach out: and if it be told you, that
some men abuse Scripture, it is true,
for if your Priests had not abused
Scripture, they could not thus have
abused you; but there is no necessity they
should, and you need not unless you
list; any more than you need to abuse
the Sacrament or Decrees of the Church,
or the messages of your friend, or the
Letters you receive, or the Laws of the
Land, all which are lyable to be abused
by evil persons, but not by good people
and modest understandings. It is now
become a part of your Religion to be
Ignorant, to walk in blindness, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the man that hears your Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to hear none but him, not to hear
God speaking but by him, and so you
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:45050:301"/>
are lyable to be abused by him, as he
please, without remedy. You are gone
from us, where you are only taught to
worship God through Jesus Christ, and
now you are taught to Worship Saints
and Angels, with a Worship at least
dangerous and in some things proper
to God; for your Church Worships the
<hi>V. Mary</hi> with burning Incense and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
to her, and you give her presents
which by the consent of all Nations used
to be esteemed a Worship peculiar to
God, and it is the same thing which
was condemned in the <hi>Collyridians,</hi> who
offered a Cake to the <hi>V. Mary.</hi> A
Candle and a Cake make no difference
in the Worship; and your joyning God
and the Saints is like the device of
them that fought for King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the latter destroys the former.
To which he subjoynes, that the points
of difference between us and the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> are such as do evidently serve
the ends of Covetousness and Ambition
in them: and that very many of her
Doctrines are very ill Friends to a good
life, and that our Religion is incomparably
beyond theirs in point of safety: as
in point of Praying to God alone and
without Images, relying on God as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,
which are surely lawful; but
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:45050:301"/>
it is at least hugely disputable and not
at all certain that any man or society of
men can be infallible, that we may put our
trust in Saints, or Worship Images, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
From whence he concludes; So that
unless you mean to preferr a danger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
safety, temptation to unholiness before
a severe and holy Religion, unless you
mean to lose the benefit of yours prayers
by praying what you perceive not, and
the benefit of the Sacrament in great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
by falling from Christs Institution,
and taking half instead of all; unless you
desire to provoke God to jealousie by
Images, and man to jealousie in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
a Religion in which you may in
many cases have leave to forfeit your
faith and lawful trust; unless you will
choose a Catechism without the second
Commandment, and a faith that grows
bigger or lesser as men please, and a
hope that in many degrees relyes on men
and vain confidences, and a Charity that
damns all the world but your selves, unless
you will do all this, that is, suffer an abuse
in your Prayers, in the Sacrament, in the
commandments, in faith, in hope, in
Charity, in the Communion of Saints,
and your duty to your Supream, you
must return to the bosome of your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and I doubt
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:45050:302"/>
not but you will find the comfort of it
in all your life, and in the day of your
death, and in the day of Judgement.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Thus far that excellent person, and I
leave you now to judge between the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
on both sides, as they are laid
down by him whom my Adversary appeals
to, and I must thank him for the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of mentioning him against me, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which I had wanted so good a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
of the Motives of either side,
and so full an Answer to the pretences
brought for the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> The
other Motives which he adds of <hi>Fathers,
Councils</hi> and <hi>Tradition,</hi> he knows are utterly
denyed by us; and I wonder he should
insist upon them, since in the matters of
our debate, <hi>Antiquity</hi> is so evidently of
our side, as against Worship of Images
and Saints, against Purgatory, Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,
Prayers in an unknown tongue,
and he thinks it no great matter to allow
us <hi>a thousand years</hi> against communion in
one kind; and yet all this while <hi>Scripture,
Fathers, Councils,</hi> and <hi>Tradition</hi> are all on
their side. For the <hi>testimony of the present
Church;</hi> we deny that <hi>S. Austin</hi> speaks of
it as of it self sufficient; and though he
did, that concerns not the <hi>Roman Church</hi>
any more than other parts of the <hi>Catholick
Church;</hi> and he may assoon prove <hi>Tyber</hi>
               <pb n="557" facs="tcp:45050:302"/>
to be the <hi>Ocean,</hi> or <hi>S. Peters</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> to
have been before the <hi>Temple</hi> at <hi>Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
as prove the <hi>Roman Church</hi> to be the
<hi>Catholick Church,</hi> or the <hi>Mother</hi> of all
<hi>others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 17. But I must conclude,<note place="margin">The saith of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to Principles.</note> with <hi>the
method he prescribes to you</hi> for satisfaction
from me; which is <hi>not to meddle with
particular disputes,</hi> (which we know very
well the reason of) <hi>but to call upon me for
a Catalogue of our grounds, and to bring
things to Grounds and Principles</hi> (as they
have learnt to Cant of late) <hi>and then,</hi> he
saith, <hi>Controversie will soon be at an end.</hi>
I should be glad to see it so; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
his Friend <hi>I. S.</hi> accounts it so
<hi>noble a Science,</hi> unless he hath changed his
mind, since for so many years now, he
hath failed in the <hi>Defence</hi> of his <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations.</hi>
But to satisfie the <hi>men</hi> of <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi>
and to let them see we can do more
<hi>than find fault with their Religion,</hi> I shall
give an account of the <hi>faith</hi> of <hi>Protestants</hi>
in the way of <hi>Principles;</hi> and of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of our rejecting their impositions,
which is all we can understand by <hi>Negative
Points;</hi> and if we can give an account of
the <hi>Christian faith</hi> independently on their
<hi>Churches Authority</hi> and <hi>Infallibility</hi> it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
follows that cannot be the <hi>founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of faith; and so we may be very
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:45050:303"/>
               <hi>good Christians</hi> without having any thing
to do with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> And I
know no other Answer necessary, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to this present demand, but to a
Book called <hi>Protestants without Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi>
the falsity of which will appear by
what follows.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="points_of_agreement">
            <pb n="559" facs="tcp:45050:303"/>
            <head>Principles Agreed on
both sides.</head>
            <p>1. THat there is a <hi>God</hi> from whom man,
and all other Creatures had their
Being.</p>
            <p>2. That the notion of God doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
that he is a Being absolutely perfect,
and therefore Justice, Goodness, Wisdom,
and Truth must be in him to the highest
degree of perfection.</p>
            <p>3. That man receiving his Being from
God, is thereby bound to obey his will,
and consequently is lyable to punishment
in case of disobedience.</p>
            <p>4. That in order to mans obeying the
will of God, it is necessary that he know
what it is; for which some manifestation
of the will of God is necessary, both that
man may know what he hath to do, and
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:45050:304"/>
that God may justly punish him if he do
it not.</p>
            <p>5. Whatever God reveals to man is
infallibly true, and being intended for the
rule of mans obedience may be certainly
known to be his Will.</p>
            <p>6. God cannot act contrary to those
essential Attributes of Justice, Wisdom,
Goodness and Truth in any way which he
makes choice of, to make known his will
unto man by.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>These thing being agreed on both sides,
we are now to inquire into the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
wayes which God hath made
choice of for revealing his will to
mankind.</head>
               <p>1. AN entire obedience to the will of
God being agreed, to be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of mans happiness no other way
of Revelation is in it self necessary, to that
end, than such whereby man may know
what the will of God is.</p>
               <p>2. Man being framed a rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
capable of reflecting upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
may antecedently to any external
Revelation, certainly know the Being
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:45050:304"/>
of God, and his dependence upon him;
and those things which are naturally
pleasing unto him, else there could be
no such thing as a Law of Nature,
or any principles of Natural Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>3. All supernatural and external Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
must suppose the truth of natural
Religion; for unless we be antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
certain that there is a God, and that
we are capable of knowing him, it is
impossible to be certain that God hath
revealed his will to us by any superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
means.</p>
               <p>4. Nothing ought to be admitted
for Divine Revelation which overthrows
the certainty of those Principles which
must be antecedently supposed to all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Revelation. For that were to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the means whereby we are to
Judge concerning the truth of any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Revelation.</p>
               <p>5. There can be no other means
imagined, whereby we are to judge of
the truth of Divine Revelation, but a
Faculty in us of discerning truth and
falshood in matters proposed to our
belief, which if we do not exercise in
Judging the truth of Divine Revelation,
we must be imposed upon by every thing
which pretends to be so.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="562" facs="tcp:45050:305"/>
6. The pretence of Infallibility in any
person or Society of men, must be Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the same way, that the truth of
a Divine Revelation is, for that Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
being challenged by vertue of a
supernatural assistance, and for that end
to assure men what the will of God is, the
same means must be used for the trial of
that, as for any other supernatural way
of Gods making known his Will to
men.</p>
               <p>7. It being in the power of God to
make choice of several wayes of reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his will to us, we ought not to
dispute from the Attributes of God the
necessity of one particular way to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of all others, but we ought to
enquire what way God himself hath
chosen: and whatever he hath done,
we are sure cannot be repugnant to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Justice, Wisdome, Goodness, and
Truth.</p>
               <p>8. Whatever way is capable of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
conveying the will of God to us,
may be made choice of by him for the
means of making known his will in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the happiness of mankind; so that
no Argument can be sufficient <hi>a priori</hi>
to prove, that God cannot choose any
particular way to reveal his mind by, but
such which evidently proves the insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:45050:305"/>
of that means for conveying the
Will of God to us.</p>
               <p>9. There are several wayes conceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by us, how God may make known
his Will to us, either by immediate
voice from Heaven, or inward inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to every particular person; or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring
some to speak personally to others,
or assisting them with an infallible spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in Writing such Books, which shall
contain the Will of God for the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of distant Persons and future
Ages.</p>
               <p>10. If the Will of God cannot be
sufficiently declared to men by Writing,
it must either be because no Writing can
be intelligible enough for that end, or
that it can never be known to be Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by men infallibly assisted; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is repugnant to common sense, for
words are equally capable of being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
spoken, or written, the latter
overthrows the possibility of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
being known to be the Word of
God.</p>
               <p>11. It is agreed among all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
that although <hi>God</hi> in the first Ages
of the World did reveal his mind to
men immediately by a voice or secret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirations,
yet afterwards he did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
his mind to some immediately
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:45050:306"/>
inspired to Write his Will in Books to
be preserved for the benefit of future
Ages, and particularly that these Books
of the New Testament which we now
Receive were so Written by the Apostles
and Disciples of Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>12. Such Writings having been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by the <hi>Christian</hi> Church of the
first Ages as Divine and Infallible, and
being delivered down as such to us by
an universal consent of all Ages since,
they ought to be owned by us as the
certain rule of faith; whereby we are
to Judge what the Will of God is in
order to our Salvation, unless it appear
with an evidence equal to that whereby
we believe those Books to be the Word of
God, that they were never intended for
that end, because of their obscurity or
imperfection.</p>
               <p>13. Although we cannot argue against
any particular way of Revelation from
the necessary Attributes of God, yet
such a way as writing being made choice
of by him, we may justly say, that it
is repugnant to the nature of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
and the Wisdom and Goodness
of God to give infallible assurance
to persons in Writing his Will, for
the benefit of Mankind, if those Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
may not be understood by all
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:45050:306"/>
persons who sincerely endeavour to know
the meaning of them in all such
things as are necessary for their salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>14. To suppose the Books so Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to be imperfect, <hi>i. e.</hi> that any
things necessary to be believed or
practised are not contained in them,
is either to charge the first Author
of them with fraud, and not deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his whole mind, or the Writers
with insincerity in not setting it down,
and the whole Christian Church of
the first Ages with folly, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
the Fulness and Prefection of
the Scriptures in order to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>15. These Writings being owned as
containing in them the whole Will of
God so plainly revealed, that no sober
enquirer can miss of what is necessary
for salvation; there can be no necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
supposed of any infallible society of
men either to attest or explain these
Writings among Christians, any more
than there was for some Ages before
<hi>Christ</hi> of such a Body of men among
the <hi>Iews,</hi> to attest or explain to them
the Writings of <hi>Moses</hi> or the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="566" facs="tcp:45050:307"/>
16. There can be no more intolerable
usurpation upon the faith of <hi>Christians,</hi>
than for any Person or Society of men to
pretend to an assistance, as infallible in what
they propose as was in <hi>Christ</hi> or his <hi>Apostles,</hi>
without giving an equal degree of evidence,
that they are so assisted as <hi>Christ</hi> and his
<hi>Apostles</hi> did, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>miracles</hi> as great,
publick, and convincing as theirs were, by
which I mean, such as are wrought by
those very persons who challeng this infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility,
and with a design for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of those who doe not believe it.</p>
               <p>17. Nothing can be more absurd than
to pretend the necessity of such an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
commission and assistance to assure us
of the truth of these writings, and to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
them, and at the same time to prove
that commission from those writings, from
which we are told nothing can be certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deduced, such an assistance not being
supposed; or to pretend that infallibility
in a body of men, is not as lyable to doubts
and disputes as in those books from whence
only they derive their infallibility.</p>
               <p>18. There can be no hazard to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in mistaking the meaning of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
place in those books, supposing
he use, the best means for understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, comparable to that which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one runs, who believes any person
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:45050:307"/>
or society of men to be infallible who are
not: for in this latter he runs unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
into one great errour, and by that
may be led into a thousand, but in the
former God hath promised either he
shall not erre, or he shall not be damned
for it.</p>
               <p>19. The assistance which God hath
promised to those who sincerely desire to
know his will, may give them greater as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of the truth of what is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the bookes of Scripture, than it is
possible for the greatest infallibility in
any other persons to doe, supposing they
have not such assurance of their infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>20. No mans faith can therefore be
infallible meerly because the Proponent is
said to be infallible; because the nature
of <hi>Assent</hi> doth not depend upon the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective
infallibility of any thing without
us, but is agreeable to the evidence we
have of it in our minds; for assent is not
built on the nature of things but their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
to us.</p>
               <p>21. It is therefore necessary in order
to an infallible assent, that every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
person be infallibly assisted in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the matters proposed to him to
be believed, so that the ground on which
a necessity of some external infallible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:45050:308"/>
is asserted, must rather make e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
particular person infallible, if no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
faith can be without an infallible as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and so renders any other infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
useless.</p>
               <p>22. If no particular person be infallible
in the assent he gives to matters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by others to him, then no man
can be infallibly sure that the Church is infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible;
and so the Churches infallibility can
signifie nothing to our infallible assurance
without an equal infallibility in our selves
in the belief of it.</p>
               <p>23. The infallibility of every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
person being not asserted by those, who
plead for the infallibility of a Church,
and the one rendring the other useless
(for if every person be infallible, what need
any representative Church to be so) and
the infallibility of a Church being of
no effect, if every person be not infallible
in the belief of it, we are farther to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
what certainty men may have in
matters of faith, supposing no external
proponent to be infallible.</p>
               <p>24. There are different degrees of
certainty to be attained according to the
different degrees of evidence, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of divine assistance; but every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
by the use of his reason, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
helps of Grace may attain to so
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:45050:308"/>
great a degree of certainty, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
arguments of the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and authority of the Scriptures, that
on the same grounds on which men doubt
of the truth of them, they may as well
doubt of the truth of those things
which they Judge to be most evident to
sense or reason.</p>
               <p>25. No man who firmly assents to any
thing as true, can at the same time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine
any suspition of the falshood of
it, for that were to make him certain
and uncertain of the same thing: it is
therefore absurd to say, that those who
are certain of what they believe, may at
the same time not know but it may
be false, which is an apparent contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and overthrowes any faculty in us of
judging of truth or falshood.</p>
               <p>26. Whatever necessarily proves a thing
to be true, doth at the same time prove
it impossible to be false; because it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
the same thing should be true and
false at the same time. Therefore they
who assent firmly to the doctrine of the
Gospel as true, doe thereby declare their
belief of the Impossibility of the falshood
of it.</p>
               <p>27. The nature of certainty doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
several names, either according to
the nature of the proof or the degrees
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:45050:309"/>
of the assent. Thus <hi>moral certainty</hi> may
be so called, either as it is opposed to
<hi>Mathematical evidence,</hi> but implying a
firme assent upon the highest evidence,
that Moral things can receive: or as it
is opposed to a higher degree of certainty
in the same kind; so Moral certainty im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
only greater <hi>probabilities</hi> of one side
than the other; in the former sense we
assert the <hi>certainty</hi> of Christian faith to
be <hi>moral,</hi> but not only in the latter.</p>
               <p>28. A Christian being thus certain
to the highest degree of a firme assent
that the Scriptures are the word of God,
his faith is thereby resolved into the
Scriptures as into the rule and measure
of what he is to believe, as it is into
the veracity of God as the ground of his
believing what is therein contained.</p>
               <p>29. No Christian can be obliged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
any pretence of infallibility to believe
any thing as a matter of faith, but what
was revealed by God himself in that book
wherein he believes his will to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and consequently is bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
whatsoever is offered to be imposed
upon his faith, which hath no founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Scripture, or is contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
which rejection is no making <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Articles of faith,</hi> but only applying
the general grounds of faith to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:45050:309"/>
instances, as because I believe nothing
necessary to salvation, but what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in Scripture, therefore no such
particular things which neither are there
nor can be deduced thence.</p>
               <p>30. There can be no better way to
prevent mens mistakes in the sense of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
(which men being fallible are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to) than the considering the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of mistaking in a matter wherein
their salvation is concerned: And there
can be no sufficient reason given why that
may not serve in matters of faith, which
God himself hath made use of, as the
means to keep men from sin in their
lives: unless any imagine that errours in
opinion are far more dangerous to mens
souls, than a vitious life is, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God is bound to take more care to
prevent the one than the other.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>It followeth that,</head>
               <p>1. There is no necessity at all, or use
of an infallible Society of men to assure
men of the truth of those things, which
they may be certain without, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
have any greater assurance, suppos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such infallibility to be in them.</p>
               <p>2. The infallibility of that Society of
men, who call themselves the Catholick
<pb n="672" facs="tcp:45050:310"/>
Church, must be examined by the same
faculties in man, the same rules of tryal,
the same motives by which the infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of any divine revelation is.</p>
               <p>3. The less convincing the miracles,
the more doubtful the marks, the more
obscure the sense of either what is called
the Catholick Church or declared by it, the
less reason hath any Christian to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
upon the account of any who call
themselves by the name of the <hi>Catholick
Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. The more absurd any opinions are
and repugnant to the first principles of sense
and reason, which any <hi>Church</hi> obtrudes
upon the faith of men, the greater rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
men still have to reject the pretence
of infallibility in that Church as a grand
imposture.</p>
               <p>5. To disown what is so taught by
such a Church, is not to question the
veracity of God, but so firmly to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to that, in what he hath revealed
in Scriptures, that men dare not out of
love to their souls reject what is so
taught.</p>
               <p>6. Though nothing were to be believed
as the will of God, but what is by the
Catholick Church declared to be so, yet
this doth not at all concern the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>Rome,</hi> which neither is the <hi>Catholick
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:45050:310"/>
Church,</hi> nor any sound part or member
of it. This may suffice to shew the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
of the principles on which the faith
of Protestants stands, and the weakness of
those of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> From all
which it followes, that it can be nothing
but willful Ignorance, weakness of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
strength of prejudice, or some sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
passion, <hi>which makes any one</hi> forsake
the Communion of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
to embrace that of the Church of
Rome.</p>
