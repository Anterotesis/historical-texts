            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Great News from the West of England.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>Being a True Account of Two Young Persons lately <hi>Bewitch'd</hi> in the Town
of <hi>Beckenton</hi> in <hi>Somerset-shire:</hi> Shewing the sad Condition they are in, by
Vomiting, or Throwing out of their Bodies, the Abundance of <hi>Pins, Nails,
Pewter, Brass, Lead, Iron,</hi> and <hi>Tin,</hi> to the Admiration of all Beholders.</p>
               <p>And of the old <hi>Witch</hi> being carryed several Times to a great River; into which, her
Legs being tied, she was Thrice thrown in; but each Time, she Swam like a <hi>Cork.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AFTERWARDS,</p>
               <p>By Order from a <hi>Iustice of Peace,</hi> she was Search'd by a Jury of Women,
and such Signs and Marks being found about her, positive Oath was given
in against her; so that she is Committed to Jayl, until the next Assizes.</p>
            </argument>
            <opener>Licensed and Entred according to Order.</opener>
            <p>I Know there be Persons in the World, who will not believe there are <hi>Witches;</hi> that
is, such Persons, who, by a League and Confederacy with the Devil, do get him
to enter, possess, and torment the Bodies of Children, and others: But whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
shall read this ensuing Narrative, if he be not an Atheist in his Heart, as
well as in his Practice, may be easily Convinc'd; and see the Necessity of keeping close
to GOD, in a constant Performance of his Duty; that GOD may keep close to him in
his dayly Preservation and Safety.</p>
            <p>IN the Town of <hi>Beckenton,</hi> about Two Miles from <hi>Froom,</hi> and Seven from <hi>Bath,</hi> in
<hi>Somerset-shire,</hi> liveth one <hi>William Spicer,</hi> a young Man about eighteen Years of Age;
as he was wont to pass by the <hi>Alms-house</hi> (where lived an Old Woman, about Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score)
he would call her <hi>Witch,</hi> and tell her of her <hi>Buns;</hi> which did so enrage the
Old Woman, that she threatened him with a <hi>Warrant;</hi> and accordingly did fetch one
from a Neighbouring <hi>Iustice of the Peace;</hi> at which he was so frightened, that he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
himself to her, and promised never to call her so again. Within a few days after
this Young Man fell into the strangest Fits that ever Mortal beheld with Eyes, and
these, by turns, held him about a Fortnight: When the Fits were upon him, he would
often say, <hi>That he did see this Old Woman against the Wall in the same Room of the House
where he was, and that sometimes she did knock her Fist at him; sometimes grin her Teeth,
and sometimes laugh at him in his Fits.</hi> He was so strong, that three or four Men could
scarce hold him; and when he did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> call for <hi>Small Beer</hi> to drink, he would be sure to
bring up some <hi>Crooked Pins;</hi> first and last, to the Number of Thirty, and upwards.</p>
            <p>In the same Town liveth one <hi>Mary Hill,</hi> about the same Age of this Young Man;
who meeting with this Old Woman, demanded the Ring she borrowed of her; and
through her Importunity, she prevailed to get the Ring (with this Threatning) from
the Old Woman, <hi>That she had been better to have let her kept it longer.</hi> About a Week
before the said <hi>Mary</hi> was taken with Fits, she met this Old Woman in the Street;
who taking her by the hand, desired her to goe with her to <hi>Froom,</hi> to look after some
<hi>Spinning Work;</hi> for none in the Town would suffer her to have any: The said <hi>Mary</hi>
being afraid, refused to go with her: About four days after she met the Old Woman
again, who would have begg'd an Apple of her, having newly bought some, which she
refused to give her.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sunday</hi> following, she complained of a pricking in her Stomack; but on <hi>Monday,</hi>
as she was Eating her Dinner, something arose in her Throat, which was like to have
Choaked her; and at the same time fell into Violent Fits, which held her till Nine or
Ten a Clock at Night; the Fits were so strong and violent, that Four or Five Persons
were scarce able to hold her, and in the midst of them, she would tell how she saw
this old Woman against the Wall, grinning at her, and being struck at, would step


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43537:2"/>
aside to avoid the blows. The day after, she was taken with the like Fits, and would
tell how she did see her as afore, and that she was the Person that had bewitcht her.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Wednesday</hi> following, she began to throw up <hi>Crooked Pins,</hi> and so continued
for the space of a Fortnight: After this, she began to throw up <hi>Nails</hi> and <hi>Pins;</hi>
and then she ceased for the space of Eight Days: And then she began to throw up
<hi>Nails</hi> again, and <hi>Handles</hi> of <hi>Spoons,</hi> both of <hi>Pewter</hi> and <hi>Brass;</hi> several pieces of <hi>Iron,
Lead,</hi> and <hi>Tin,</hi> with several clusters of <hi>Crooked Pins;</hi> some tied with Yarn, and some
with Thread, with abundance of Blood between while; and so she continued to do for
some considerable time: She threw up in all, above Two Hundred <hi>Crooked Pins,</hi> besides
several clusters of <hi>Crooked Pins,</hi> Sixteen or Seventeen in a cluster, Seven Pieces of <hi>Pewter,</hi>
Four Pieces of <hi>Brass,</hi> being <hi>Handles</hi> of <hi>Spoons,</hi> Six Pieces of <hi>Lead;</hi> some whereof were
<hi>Handles</hi> of <hi>Spoons,</hi> and some, the <hi>Lead</hi> of a <hi>Window,</hi> besides one solid Piece of <hi>Lead,</hi>
which weighed full two Ounces; Six long Pieces of <hi>Latten,</hi> with <hi>Wire</hi> belonging to
them; Five-Pieces of <hi>Iron,</hi> one whereof was round, but hollow, and very big; and Two
and Twenty <hi>Nails,</hi> some whereof were <hi>Board-Nails,</hi> above three Inches and a Quarter long.</p>
            <p>The People of the Town seeing the sad and deplorable Condition of the said <hi>Mary,</hi>
and being much concerned for her, did cause this old Woman to be brought near the
House where the said <hi>Mary</hi> Lived, unknown to her; and being gathered together
above an Hundred People, the said <hi>Mary</hi> was brought forth into the open Air, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
fell into such strong Fits, that two or three men were scarce able to hold
her: And being brought upon the Hill by the Church; and the old Woman brought
near her (notwithstanding there were four men to hold the said <hi>Mary</hi> in a Chair)
she mounted up over their Heads into the Air; but the men, and others standing by,
caught hold of her Legs, and pulled her down again.</p>
            <p>This Woman was ordered by a <hi>Iustice</hi> of the <hi>Peace,</hi> to be searcht by a <hi>Iury</hi> of
Women, who found about her several purple Spots, which they prickt with a sharp
Needle, but she felt no pain: She had about her other Marks and Tokens of a <hi>Witch,</hi>
of which the Women upon Oath, gave an Account to the <hi>Iustice;</hi> and some Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
possitively against her, she was sent to the County <hi>Iayle,</hi> where she is remaining to
be Tryed the next <hi>Assizes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This old Woman was had to a great River near the Town, to see whether she could
sink under Water; her Legs being tied, she was put in, and tho' she did endeavour to
the uttermost (by her Hands) to get her self under, yet she could not, but would
lie upon her Back, and did Swim like a piece of Cork: There were present above
Twenty Persons to Attest the Truth of this, yet could not gain Credit in the minds
of People: Therefore, she was had to the Water a second time, and being put in, she
swam as at first; and tho' there were present above Two Hundred People to see this
Sight, yet it could not be believed by many. At the same time, also, there was put
into the Water, a Lusty young Woman, who sunk immediately, and had been drown'd,
had it not been for the help that was at hand. To satisfy the World, and to leave
no Room for doubting, the old Woman was had down to the Water the third time,
and being put in as before, she did still Swim. At this Swimming of her, were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
such a Company of People of the Town and Country, and many of them, Persons
of Quality, as could not well be Numbred; so that now, there is scarce one Person
that doubts of the Truth of this thing.</p>
            <p>It is full Ten Weeks ago (from the <hi>Twenty Eight</hi> of <hi>October</hi> last past) that this
young Woman was first seized with these Terrible Fits: And tho' she had been Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Minister of the place, who for sometime Prayed with her Twice a Day;
and by a <hi>Non-co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> that Lives in the same Parish, that Twice performed
the like Office, yet she continues to be often seized with terrible Fits, and to bring
up both <hi>Nails</hi> and <hi>Handles of Spoons,</hi> and is still remaining an Object of great Pity,
and to be remembred at the Throne of Grace daily.</p>
