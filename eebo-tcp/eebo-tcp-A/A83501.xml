            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Oh there is ſuch a fire kindled in this Kingdome about theſe points, that unleſſe the Lord looke downe from Heaven, and graciouſly be pleaſed to quench it timely, it may hazzard the burning and conſuming all.

The ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſideration of which hath ſtirred up in me ſtrong reſolutions, to lay out my ſelfe (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that meaſure of the giſt of Chriſt beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon me) for the healing of this ſchiſme, and quenching this fire. Now the firſt borne of this kind (though not the firſt conceived) is this preſent Treatiſe againſt <hi>Independant Government,</hi> and the <hi>Toleration</hi> of it, which I here humbly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to this Honourable Houſe, ſubmitting it to your grave Judgements, and ſerious Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb facs="tcp:157002:4"/>
humbly deſiring your Acceptance of it: Now the Reaſons moving me to take this bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to Dedicate this Booke to your Honours, are theſe. Firſt, that great and generall liberty you grant of free acceſſe to your Honourable Houſe, unto all rankes of perſons, in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, both by Petitions and Bookes. Secondly, that hereby I might take an occaſion to teſtifie my humble duty and thankefullneſſe unto, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with my high thoughts and eſtimation of this Honourable Houſe for all the Indefatigable paines and care beſtowed on the Publicke; See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that by You (under God, and the Kings moſt Excellent Majeſty) I, and hundreds of my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, enjoy ſo great quietneſſe and freedome in our Miniſteries, Eſtates, Perſons, (after ſo great a ſtorme) and that very worthy deeds are done, both to us, and to this Nation by your Providence, we accept it alwayes, and in all places, moſt Noble Patriots, with all thankfullneſſe, and here I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to you the firſt fruites of my labours, as a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Monument of Gratitude. Thirdly, that by preſenting it to You, both my ſelfe and Booke might here take Sanctuary, and have your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection againſt the many Calumnies and Reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which will be caſt upon us from that ſpirit of Separation. Neither flye I to this Honourable Houſe, as if I were conſcious to my ſelfe of any crimes or juſt grounds of ſuch revilings (for had I not Innocency and Integrity in my actions, and intentions, I durſt not preſent this Booke to this Juſt and Honourable Houſe, as knowing well
<pb facs="tcp:157002:4"/>
you are a refuge onely for Innocent and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed perſons, and perſons who ſeeke the Publicke good) Or, as if I were not fore-armed to beare them; I know whom I ſerve in this worke, and <note place="margin">Quiſquis volens detrabir fama meae, iſte nob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Fourthly, I take this boldneſſe, that ſo I might have an opportunity, to move and ſtirre you up, moſt Noble Worthies, to put to your hands for the earely and timely compounding of this great Controverſie about the Church, and Church Government: When fires are begun in great Cities and Townes, or Tumults raiſed, the Fathers of Families, and the Citizens run to the Magiſtrates and Governours to acquaint them with the caſe, and to deſire their helpe, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

power to command both Men, Armes, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Engines, buckets from every quarter, the fire is quickely out, and the peace ſetled. Now be pleaſed to ſuffer me to mind you of that which few or none doe, namely of our danger from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors on the right hand, the growing and ſpreading evill of this preſent time. Every one minds you by Petitions, Sermous, Bookes, concerning the Reformation of this Church, in Government, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, Ceremonies, and worſhip; and God forbid that a word ſhould ever fall from my mouth, or my pen draw a line, to call you off from it. Goe on ſtrongly and fully in the worke of Reformation to purge this Church thorowly, and purely to take away all our droſſe and tinne; caſt out of the way all ſtumbling blocks, &amp; gather out all things that offend, let nothing be left to hurt or to deſtroy in Gods holy mountaine; Break downe all Images and Crucifixes, throw downe all Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, remove the High Places, breake to peeces the brazen Serpents, which have beene ſo abuſed to Idolatry and ſuperſtition, put out the unprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and ſcandalous Miniſters, take a courſe for ſetting up good Paſtors and Miniſters in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Congregation, and in your great Wiſdomes, and zeale be pleaſed to conſider of wayes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide oyle for al the Lampes of the Sanctuary; Goe on Comfortably (for God is with you, and the Miniſters with ſounding Trumpets of Miniſtery of Word and Prayer; and the people of God with you, covering you all over with earneſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and and teares, as alſo with praiſes to God
<pb facs="tcp:157002:5"/>
for you) and be pleaſed to remember not to doe the worke of God by halves, or negligently. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and thorow Reformation, will be your praiſe both with God and all good men, at home and abroad; and your zeale may provoke other Kingdomes, and States, and many will ariſe up and call you bleſſed, for the good Paſtors, and pure Ordinances that they ſhall enjoy.

It was the praiſe of other Kings, that they were taken away, as of King <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> Perfect Reformation takes away all poſſibility and hopes from men, of bringing things backe againe; but an imperfect leaves both a ground-worke, and faire poſſibility upon any advantage or opportunity to returne: <hi>Theodoret in</hi> his <hi>Eccle. historie</hi> relates that <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> that moſt faithfull Emperor, being fully ſet <note place="margin">Theod. hiſt.

and obſerves the courſe of things may ſee that errors on the right hand are now comming on the ſtage to take their turne alſo and to act their part; the Devill ſeeing he cannot effect his ends in the former wayes he went, he will now try others, as <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſpeaks in the caſe of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan <note place="margin">Theod.

Satan is now transforming himſelfe from an Angell of darkneſſe into an Angell of light, and though hee muſt uſe other kind of inſtruments, and goe other waies, yet tis to bring about the ſame things, the upholding of his kingdome and the hindring of Gods, ſo that he will now labour to doe that by correcting and building up, which hee did before by perſecuting and pulling downe (as <hi>Luther</hi> ſpeakes.)

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Churches gathered and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by the Apoſtles, watered by Evangeliſts and Prophets, and after planting and watering, having Paſtors and Teachers, with all other Officers, as they ſay, ſet over them by the Apoſtles and their owne Elections: Yet it is evident theſe Churches could not well ſtand nor ſubſiſt of themſelves with all theſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, but many of them had beene much indangered, and ſubject to have beene ruined, if ſome others beſides
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:157002:12"/>
theſe Churches and Officers had not upon occaſions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed and that authorotatively, as the Apoſtles, Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, and Elders of other Churches, as doth appeare by the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> and by many Epiſtles, as to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, Galatia, Coloſſians, Timothy, Titus: 15. Acts: 2. Cor. 12. Chap. 20. ver. 24. 2. Cor. 13. Chap. 1. 2. 10. ver.</hi> The particulars whereof I ſhall evince more largely hereafter. Now if theſe Primitive Churches who had all the officers, and were ſetled by the Apoſtles in all poynts according to Chriſts order, yet in thoſe times could not doe well Independently, how can wee thinke that any particular congregation in theſe times (which cannot be ſo ſetled having no Apoſtles nor any infallible men to direct them) can doe well without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendancie? And though it will be ſaid theſe extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Officers be now ceaſed, yet let them conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there is not need of ſome way to ſupply this want to the particular Churches now: But if it be ſaid that the ordinary Officers of Paſtors, Teachers, Elders, with the body of the Congregation will ſuffice for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning every particular congregation Independant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; To that I anſwer according to their Principles, In the Apoſtles times there were all theſe Officers in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregations, and ſetled in a perfect way, and yet for all this, particular Churches needed a dependan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, Prophets, and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of other Churches, and <hi>Timothie,</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> are ſet over the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Crete:</hi> now though ſome of theſe be ceaſed, and ſo this power may be cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as it was in particular men, yet that the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations ſhould not need it now in theſe times as well as then, no ſolid Reaſon can be given, but there is much more reaſon for it now, which therefore muſt bee in ſome other way, be it Synods and Councels, to ſupply the defects of each particular, by the Conjunction of the whole, the whole helping every part, and ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is lacking to it; and this reaſon hath the more
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:157002:12"/>
ſtrength in it, if we conſider that the Churches in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles times were Churches in Cities, it being all one to ſay in every City, or in every Church, 1 <hi>Tit. 5. 14. Act.</hi> 23. which Churches alſo had good ſtore of Preaching Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters amongſt them, as appeares by <hi>Acts 13. v. 1. Act. 20. v.</hi> 36, 37. Compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 28. So that in all caſes of Doctrine and Diſcipline, having many Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to reſolve and determine matters, and to have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed them with the more gravity and authority, they might have ſubſiſted the better Independantly, whereas moſt particular Congregations now have but few Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, one or two, nay, according to their Principles there may be none, nor no Officer at all, and yet theſe Congregations muſt be Independant, having all power and government Independantly, before Officers as well as after.</p>

               <p>THat Governement and power which cauſes men to runne upon the manifeſt violation of the conſtant practice and example of the Churches during all the time of the Apoſtles, and puts Churches upon practices that are abſurd, unreaſonable and prejudiciall to the good of their Soules, that government is not of divine Inſtitution, nor to be received: but ſuch is the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant power, and government of particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations: The <hi>major</hi> is of undoubted Truth, and will be denyed by none, for the <hi>minor</hi> I will prove it in theſe following Inſtances.</p>
               <p>Firſt, their Independancy forces them either to have Miniſters and Officers without being ordained, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the practice and examples of the Churches all along in the New Teſtament, as the 6. <hi>Acts v. 6. 14.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:157002:13"/>

Inſtit. lib. 4. c. 3.

Apol. ca. 1. 18.</note> but by a lawfull Calling: Thou art called a Paſtor (that is elected, and ordained) or elſe if their Officers be ordained, it is by the people, even by ſuch who are not in office, which is expreſly againſt the conſtant pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of all the Churches in the New Teſtament, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by the 6. <hi>Acts 6. 14. Acts 23. 1 Tim. 4. 14. 1 Tim. 5. 22. 1 Tit.</hi> 5. and it can never be ſhowne in all the New Teſtament, that the people ever attempted any ſuch thing; thus <hi>Zanchius</hi> ſhowes that this is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in Scriptures, although election of Miniſters was made by the whole Church, yet hands were never impoſed but by the Miniſtery and Presbytery, this is <note place="margin">Zanch. in 4. pr. 786.</note> cleare in the <hi>Acts</hi> &amp; Epiſtles of <hi>Paul:</hi> and the people can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do it, becauſe the leſſe is bleſſed of the greater, &amp; they who lay hands on and make Miniſters, ſhould be greater in place and Authority &amp; not leſſe, as the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be: and though it be granted (as <hi>Cameron</hi> ſpeakes) that an equall may make and ordaine an equall, yet he who is <note place="margin">Calv. lib. 4. c. 3. ſect. 16.</note> an Inferior, cannot a Superior.

Eccleſiaſticall, though never ſo ſmall, what things ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, by whom ſoever, or under what colour ſoever they be invented: Now Ordination cannot be held extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and temporary, neither is it by them, and tis held to be an Eccleſiaſticall thing alſo, and certainely none of the leaſt among Eccleſiaſticalls, in matter of order and <hi>decorum,</hi> there being not any one thing concerning mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Order, that hath ſo cleere and conſtant practice as this; I am ſure all their whole frame of Church and Diſcipline, hath not ſo much ground in the Word for it as this, namely, that Miniſters ought to be Ordained, <note place="margin">Calv.

So <hi>Calvin,</hi> although there be no expreſſe precept concerning the impoſition of hands, yet becauſe we ſee it was in perpetuall uſe by the Apoſtles, the ſo accurate obſervation of it by them ought to be to us inſtead of a command. So <hi>Zanchius</hi> ſpeaking of Impoſition of hands in ordination, ſaith thus, that this in many places is rejected, together with <note place="margin">Zanch. in 4. pr. 786, 787. p.</note> other ceremonies, I never approved nor can approve. I know there is no expreſſe precept concerning this thing but notwithſtanding I would have the examples of the Apoſtles, and the ancient Church more to be eſteemed of, yea they ought to be to us inſtead of a command: and in another place he ſpeakes, tis certaine, tis not a vaine ceremony but the holy Spirit is preſent, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme thoſe things inwardly, which are ſignified by this outward Rite: And yet if Ordination were but a very <note place="margin">Ameſ. lib. 1. cap. 49.</note> little thing, but a Ceremony, the eſſence of calling, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in Election, and that but the conſummation of it, nothing but the ſolemne introduction of the Miniſter into the free execution of his calling, yet if Maſter <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binſon</hi> may be believed, and your ſelves in other little things, we muſt not depart from Chriſts way, or goe any other way, in things concerning his houſe and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers than he hath directed, and yet behold in this either Miniſters are not called according to the ſcripture wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that part of their calling, namely Ordination, or

elſe, if they be, it is in another way than the Apoſtles or Churches of Chriſt ever practiſed, behold how this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependancy cauſes men to depart farre from the practice of the Apoſtles. And I deſire they would ſhow for what reaſon <hi>Paul</hi> left <hi>Titus</hi> at <hi>Crete,</hi> to make Miniſters in every City, if Ordination were not neceſſary for all Miniſters of the Goſpell under the New Teſtament, or if being neceſſary, it might be performed to Miniſters by the people without Officers: <hi>Titus</hi> might have beene imployed better to have gone along with <hi>Paul,</hi> Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and helping to convert others, and might have well left the Churches in <hi>Crete,</hi> either to have had Miniſters without Ordination, or elſe left the People to Ordaine them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this Independancy cauſes them to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on practiſes abſurd and unreaſonable, as namely either their Miniſters muſt not firſt be examined tryed and known for their gifts and abilities before they be made, which is contrary to the Scriptures, 1 <hi>Tim. 3. v.</hi> 10. they muſt firſt be proved, and if it hold in Deacons, much <note place="margin">Zanchius in 4.

               <p>THe toleration deſired will not helpe to heale the Schiſmes and tents of this Church, (which is one ſpeciall thing ought to be looked unto in this preſent reformation of the Church) but will much foment and encreaſe it. For whilſt ſome congregations, and they accounted of note both for miniſters and people, will not ſubmit to the reformation and government ſetled by Law, this will breed in the peoples mindes many thoughts <hi>Ex natura rei,</hi> that this Church and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is not ordered according to the Word of God, but is unlawfull; elſe why ſhould ſuch men moſt eminent for gifts and graces, (as many people account them) refuſe to conforme to it? and this will prove as great and as continued a diviſion betweene the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and people of the Churches eſtabliſhed by Law, and the Churches tolerated, as ever was betweene Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts and Non-conformiſts about Ceremonies; nay greater, becauſe theſe are of different Churches &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, whereas Conformiſts and non-conformiſts held communion together in one Church, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending about theſe matters; and that this will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be, may be eaſily beleeved and foreſeene upon theſe grounds.</p>

I pray conſider well, ſome of your Miniſters at firſt comming over ſaid (as I have beene told from good hands) they could take the charge of <hi>Parochiall</hi> Churches amongſt us upon the reformation hoped for, and they could yeild to Presbyteriall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, by Claſſes and Synods, ſo not enjoyned to ſubmit to it, as <hi>Jure divino,</hi> but ſince they have gotten ſome more hopes (I know not upon what grounds) they are now very hot for a Toleration, and will not heare of growing into one body with us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Seeing our Churches, Miniſters, and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, be true, for you to erect new, and to withdraw from ſuch Churches (though ſuppoſe they were in ſome things defective and not every way ſo rightly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as were to be deſired) I know can never be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to God, eſpecially you having not the power and authority from God to order thoſe Churches otherwiſe, and I deſire you againe and againe to waigh whether you may not live in the Communion of ſuch Churches, where ſome thing may be yet deſired that is not, where it is not in your power to helpe, but that you are bound by the Command of God in ſuch caſes either to leave the Kingdome for that liberty, or elſe being private

men in a Land where true Churches, Miniſters, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances are, to goe and ſet up divided Churches in that Land, both againſt the Lawes of the Land, and to the ſcandall of all the Churches, I beſeech you thinke upon it what is become of <hi>Fraterna toleratio,</hi> and of giving ſcandall, not to one Brother, but to thouſands of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations of Chriſt. And whether nothing wanting in matter of Order, may be Tolerated ſo long as a man is not put upon the practiſe of that which is unlawfull. As for thoſe Browniſts whoſe Principles and Conſciences (though very erroneous) hold that we have no true Church, Miniſtery, Ordinances, but all is Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, they have a better warrant to ſet up new Aſſemblies, or to leave the Kingdome to enjoy their way; but as for you to withdraw and ſet up ſeparated aſſemblies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no greater grounds, or cauſes, can never be juſtified, and I ſhall be ready upon that point to deale with any of you, and for your better ſatisfaction for the preſent, I wiſh the conſcientious and ſober Miniſters to read two pages in Maſter <hi>Robinſons Apologie, Chap. 12. De Eccle. Anglic. pag.</hi> 86, 87. Wherein he grants that Churches may not be departed from for circumſtantiall corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor for many inconveniencies, affirming that it is neither Chriſtian prudence nor charity to doe ſo; he ſhewes it is not an intolerable evill (though an evill to be lamented) for evill men to be ſuffered in the Church, nor that Diſcipline as it is called, or that Eccleſiaſticall government inſtituted by Chriſt, is neglected, or viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but thats it, that the plaine contrary to it ſhould be eſtabliſhed by Law, and ſo he goes on: Now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing our reformation, it will be otherwiſe with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> then when he writ and the moſt that can be ſaid (ſuppoſing your principles the Truth, (though thats denyed by us) there will be but evill men ſuffered, and not men of the moſt profligate life, and Diſcipline in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted willbe but neglected or violated, not that which is quite contrary as eſtabliſhed by Law, take place.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:157002:31"/>
Thirdly, You your ſelves live in, and are members of ſuch Churches, and thinke it unlawfull to forſake them, where, for many yeares together you beare with defects, and want ſome parts of government, and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers appointed by Chriſt, more materiall then will be in ours, upon a reformation, as namely, without Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, Elders, Widowes, many yeares together, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sacraments a long time, without cenſures eſpecially unleſſe you allow people to be the inſtruments and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe Excommunication without having Ordination of Officers, without prophecying alſo many yeares; Why can you not beare with ſome defects in our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and be content to waite ſome yeares, till God ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther give you light to ſee your miſtakes, or elſe till we have more light to perfect what is wanting? You tell us that ſome things may be omitted for a time, as Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was in the Wilderneſſe, and that affirmatives doe not binde too alwayes, and that exerciſe of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline may be forborne for a time, when it is evident, it will not be for edification to the Church, but deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; what ſhall hinder then, but that you ought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate into our Aſſemblies, though ſomething yet were to be deſired? there is nothing contrary that will be put upon you (nor quite another thing.) <note place="margin">If you may publiquely proteſt againſt ſuch as you know ſhould not be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and declare againſt the Churches faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe in not proceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, you may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with them, becauſe you have done all you can in this caſe.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, You may ſafely be members of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations in the reformation of us, and in theſe times, becauſe you may without danger ſhew your diſlike and ſpeake againſt ſcandalous perſons, and againſt the fault of the Church, if they admit ſuch to the Sacrament, which being done, your ſelves grant you may commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with them, ſo a Letter ſent from <hi>Roterdam</hi> grants. And I have heard this alledged, as the reaſon why you firſt left our Churches, but that reaſon now ceaſes, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either ſuch perſons will be wholly kept away, or elſe you may proteſt againſt them (though I muſt tell you, that practiſe you judge your ſelves tyed to, is founded upon a falſe principle) namely that the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:157002:32"/>
of government is given by Chriſt to the body of the Congregation.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, There is a <hi>medium</hi> betweene perſecution (as you terme it) and a publicke Toleration, a middle way betweene not ſuffering men to live in the Land, and the granting them a liberty of ſeparated Aſſemblies, ſo that there is no neceſſity either of leaving the Land, or of enjoying exempt Congregations (for there is a third <hi>datur tertium)</hi> as for Inſtance, Perſons may be tolerated to inhabit in a Land, to enjoy their Lands, and liberties, and not be compelled to profeſſe and practiſe things which are againſt their conſciences; It is one thing to be forced and compelled poſitively to doe things againſt conſcience, and another thing, not to be ſuffered the publicke practiſe of ſome things in ſeparated Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, as to illuſtrate it thus, ſuppoſe the Papiſts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their petitions to the Parliament ſhould have thoſe ſtatutes repealed, which enjoynes them to come to our Churches, (which they ſay is againſt their conſciences) though indeed they are bound by the command of God to come, and ought by the Magiſtrate to be compelled to come (as Doctor <hi>Davenant</hi> hath cleerely ſhowed) yet the granting the Papiſts a Toleration of the publicke <note place="margin">Daven. determ. queſt. 2 7.</note> exerciſe of their Religion, to the ſcandall of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches and diſhonour of God, were quite an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other thing, inſomuch as the Papiſts though they peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the firſt, (upon deepe Proteſtation of living peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, and according to the Lawes of the Land) yet they move not for the laſt: ſo I judge you may live in the Land freely, and enjoy your liberties and eſtates, comming to our Churches, enjoying the ordinances, and are like never to be compelled to profeſſe or practiſe what is againſt your judgements, the greateſt incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience is but the forbearing of ſomething you would have, which conſidering the queſtionableneſſe of the thing, and the many other evills which would attend it, if you ſhould enjoy it, you may in point of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:157002:32"/>
be well ſatisfied without it; ſo that conſider well, and you may find a <hi>medium</hi> betweene leaving the Land and enjoying a Toleration of exempt Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, If all theſe former anſwers ſatisfie you not fully, becauſe (though theſe things be true) yet beſides theſe Ordinances and Miniſters, you muſt be in a Church way and Fellowſhip, as now you are, then know, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your Principles of a viſible Church, laid downe by Maſter <hi>Robinſon,</hi> and by your ſelves in all your Manuſcripts, you may enjoy your way in having ſeverall viſible Churches, and that without that offence and ſcandall to Magiſtrates and Churches, and yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leave the Kingdome, nor have a Toleration, and <note place="margin">Reb.

Now then every one of you <note place="margin">

I propound theſe things as being accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their principles, but not as mine.</note> in your owne Families, as the Husband, Wife, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of age, and Servants, who are viſible Saints, may be joyned in covenant to walke in Gods wayes, and to watch over one another, ſo that here is a Church, and every Maſter in his Family may ſet up holy exerciſes, and exerciſe Diſcipline among themſelves for their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and thus in the Church that is in their houſe, they may exerciſe what Diſcipline they judge is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in ours, ſo that comming to our Churches to the Word, Prayer, Sacraments, they may ſerve God in their owne Families among themſelves in a Church way, in wayes of admonition, reproofe, and other cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; nay every Church Family, or moſt of them may have Officers alſo amongſt them, the Miniſters Families may have a Paſtor or Teacher, each Miniſter being made Paſtor of his owne Family, choſen alſo he may be by
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:157002:33"/>
his Family, who alſo may Preach and inſtruct his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and exerciſe Diſcipline amongſt them; great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, as Gentlemen or Citizens may themſelves be teachers of their Families, according to your Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, or may have ſome in their Families fit to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Elders and Teachers to them, eſpecially ſuch of them who keepe Schollers in their houſes, and ſtill choſen by the Church of this Family: But if there be ſome Church Families who have none fit for Officers to their Church (which can hardly be in theſe kindes of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches) yet this is not of the eſſence of the Church. But as for ſingle perſons, as Young men and Mayds, who are of your judgement, if you aske what they ſhall doe, ſeeing they have no Families, and cannot joyne two or three in a Family to make a Church. I anſwer, they may be Servants unto men of their owne judgement, and live in the Families of their owne way, and ſo may be in a Church: And thus you may enjoy your owne way without ſcandall or diviſion, the Lawes not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding or medling what men doe in this kind, as how oft men pray in their owne Families, or catechiſe them, or whom they ſhut out from their Prayers and holy duties: But if it be ſaid, how ſhall ſuch (as are bred Schollers, the Miniſters of this way) be maintained? it is not being Miniſters to their owne Family will maintaine them? I anſwer, I have taken care to ſhow them a way for maintenance alſo, how they may enjoy their Country, their Conſciences, and maintenance, that ſo they need not be forced to ſeeke a Toleration of Churches, that they may be maintained, and that is thus; Suppoſing they will not take Paſtorall charges of Pariſhes, but onely be Paſtors of the Church in their houſe, yet holding it lawfull (as they doe) to Preach in our Congregations, they may take Lectures amongſt us, and ſo be maintained, there will be want of many men for Lectures ſetled by gifts of the dead, and then no queſtion but the government of the Church, which
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:157002:33"/>
ſhall be eſtabliſhed by Law, will be ſo moderate, that if men hold the maine points of Doctrine with the Church, be pious in life and peaceable, ſo as not to Preach nor ſpeake againſt whats eſtabliſhed by Law, nor doe not make Schiſmes to goe and ſet up ſeparated Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies (which practiſes cauſed troubles in the Church) they may enjoy all liberty and (as many Scriptures ſhow) freedome, though in point of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and judgement there may be ſome difference from things eſtabliſhed by Law (for I ſuppoſe we ſhall not have ſubſcriptions enjoyned to formes of government and Diſcipline) but onely to Doctrines, and that alſo in maine and cleere poynts, ſo that by all this you may apprehend how without a Toleration, you may in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and peaceable way enjoy your Church fellowſhip with maintenance alſo. What ever elſe you ſeeke for by a Toleration of many Families to make a Church, is but for the more comfort &amp; flouriſhing of your way, but not as that which is neceſſary to your way, now in a buſines which is but of conveniency, &amp; not of neceſſity, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your principles, (though you had a liberty &amp; pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to enjoy it, yet) where ſo muchſcandal may come of your liberty, and it cannot be avoyded (for though one of the more ſober and conſcientious Miniſters and people could uſe it better, yet moſt would abuſe it; as the rigid Browniſts, Anabaptiſts, and many weake Chriſtians) you ſhould not uſe it but forbeare, ſo the Apoſtle teaches us, 1 <hi>Cor. 8. v.</hi> 9. So <hi>Gal. 5. v.</hi> 13. 14. 15. Now a ſcandall is ſome word or action, giving an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ruine to a weake brother, which practice of yours would certainely doe; now to the avoiding the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall of the weake, <hi>All thoſe things are to be done or omitted, which may be done or omitted without ſinne,</hi> as <hi>Ameſius</hi> grants, <hi>lib. 5. de Conſ. cap.</hi> 11.

                  <hi>wherein wicked men are ſuffered, and good men depreſſed, and that upon ſeverall reaſons, amongſt others, upon this ground; Becauſe from ſuch a Church to a purer, there is oft times no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving without great dammages and hinderance, which ought to be avoyded alwayes (as much as may be) without ſinne: yea ſuch dammages and loſſes doe ſometimes cauſe that an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative precept ceaſes to bind. A man may joyne himſelfe and live in ſuch a Church, in which many defects are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to be tolerated, yea, and joyne to that Church, where the power of removing ſcandalls, and caſting out wicked men is taken away, if he cannot without great prejudice and hurt, goe to a freer Church, and men ſinne not either in joyning to ſuch a Church, or continuing in it. But yet further he grants, a man may be a member of ſuch a Church in which ſome things inſtituted by Chriſt are wanting; and where ſome things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by men are introduced.</hi> So that I beſeech you Brethren, lay all theſe ſix anſwers together, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſadly whether God requires of you, unleſſe you may have a Toleration, to leave the Kingdome: to run many hazards and dangers for Churches after your way, when as you may enjoy ſo much at home without a Toleration of exempt Aſſemblies, as I have opened in theſe ſix anſwers.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, If notwithſtanding all that is ſaid to you you will not be ſatisfied, without ſetting up Churches againſt the Church, it were better for you to leave the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:157002:34"/>
Kingdome, and to returne backe to your charges, and families into <hi>Holland,</hi> and others of your minde, who cannot be ſatisfied, to leave the Land, and to goe to <hi>New England,</hi> or elſe where, rather then by erecting of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches by Toleration or without it to diſturbe the good and peace of three Kingdomes; and this will be no great harme to many of you, for you may eaſily returne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to live and ſubſiſt there comfortably (as you ſay your ſelves:) and for my owne part were I of your way (ſo farre as I know my owne heart) I had rather goe to the uttermoſt parts of the Earth, though to live in a hard and meane condition, than to diſturbe the peace or good of three Kingdomes, as you would doe by a Toleration. Looke what is commonly ſaid, <hi>praeſtat ut pereat unus quam unit as,</hi> It is better that one periſh than unity, ſo I ſay it is farre better a few Miniſters and people wanted ſome outward accommodations of their owne Countrey than that the good of the whole ſhould be ſo in danger, neither is there any cruelty or perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution in it, (as they will be apt to phraſe it) for if the purity of Doctrine, holineſſe of life, peace of the Church cannot be preſerved by ſuch a Toleration (as I have in part ſhewed, and can make it plaine) then it ought not to be, and I will ſpeake for my ſelfe, and in the behalfe of hundreds of my Brethren, painefull in the Miniſtery, who have borne the brunt of the times, that we profeſſe we will ſubmit to the reformation and government eſtabliſhed by Law, which we doubt not but will be very bleſſed and glorious, but however things ſhould fall out, we would either patiently tolerate what is not in our ſpheare to reforme, or quietly ſit downe in the Kingdome, or elſe with leave betake our ſelves to ſome other Countryes, being fully reſolved in our Conſciences, that circumſtances in and about exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall formes of Government in matter of order can never be ſufficient grounds to us, to ſet up Churches againſt a Church where true Churches are, and ſo to prove

               <p>I But if theſe Miniſters, and ſome ſuch Churches be not tolerated, they are afraid that in time they ſhall draw moſt of the good people out of the Land after them.</p>
               <p>Firſt <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I heare one of them ſay ſo, but I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they rather hope then feare it, and this plainely ſhewes they have a good conceit of themſelves, and of their owne way.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For their feare, we feare too (but not as they doe) but this, that if they have a toleration, they may draw away many good people, eſpecially if the ceremonies and the Liturgy ſtand in full force, and their Churches tolerated, they will make brave worke in a ſhort time (though I am confident God will preſerve many judicious, adviſed Chriſtians from their way not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding:) but let there be no Toleration granted, and they once well ſhipt, and a reformation amongſt us in government, and Miniſters, that feare is over with me, we feare it not, that many will follow them, for when that which firſt bred theſe men, the violent preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of ceremonies, the caſting out of good Miniſters, the many notorious perſons ſuffered in the Church without all cenſure, ſhall be removed, many will not be bred, and others will be ſatisfied, and I doubt it not but that the godly and painefull Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> may and will, both out-Preach them, and out-live them, and may be compared with them for all excellencies, and abilities: for my part I ſhall ſpeake as I finde, I knew many of them long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they fell to this way, and know them ſince, and have not ſeene any of them better, or more profitable
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:157002:35"/>
in life and Miniſtry, for their charge; onely this I am ſure of, for ſome of them, whereas whilſt of the Church of <hi>England</hi> they Preacht often, now ſeldome, they goe looſer in their apparell and haire, they take leſſe care for the publicke in things that concerne the glory of God and Salvation of mens ſoules, their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples &amp; ſpirits grow very narrow like their Churches, they grow more ſtrange, reſerved, ſubtile, in a word, they minde little elſe but the propagation of their Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant way, (as <hi>The Proteſtation Proteſted</hi> witneſſeth abundantly) and I ſhall ſpeake my Conſcience <note place="margin">And what ever Liturgie or Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies or Diſcipline are left to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall Church Government, tis indifferent with us, ſo as we may enjoy our Chriſtian libertie in the true uſe of ſuch Ordinances, and of ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as Chriſt the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Law-giver of his Church, and Lord of the conſcience, hath left unto us in his Word.</note> from the experience I have had of many of them having ſtudyed and obſerved them and their writings and never ſaw nor heard of any men who fell ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to that way, that ever had ſo large a ſpirit for good, afterwards to take that care of propagating the Goſpell and preaching the Word to men without; I never knew any man that ever God honoured ſo much, after he fell to thoſe principles as before, though the ſame perſons before have beene active for God, doing famouſly and worthily, yet when they fall to this way, they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther blemiſh themſelves, or doe little; and the truth is, thoſe principles of ſeparation be ſuch as God did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver honour much the men who held them: looke what is ſayd by them of Epiſcopacie, that the very calling of it hath ſuch a malignity in it, that it hurts the beſt men that are placed in thoſe chaires, that I may ſay truely, of this way, there is a malignity cleaves to it, hurting the men that fall to it, by altering their ſpirits and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting their hearts, (though many of them continue good in the maine.)</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The better men they be, and the more able, the worſe to ſet up ſeparated Churches, for they will the more endanger the peace of the Kingdome, and make the Schiſmes greater.</p>
               <p>2. For their prayers we may have the benefit of them as well when they are abſent as preſent, and ſome of them have ſayd, they pray'd more for <hi>England,</hi> when out of it than when in it.</p>
               <p>3. They left the Kingdome when it was in greateſt danger and in moſt neede of helpe, and provided for themſelves to keepe in a whole skin, and without them we ſtood here in the gap, and prevailed with God, and rather than to buy their company at ſuch a rate as a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration, it is better to want it, as I ſhewed before, and I queſtion not but the Kingdome will doe well enough though they returne, and the better unleſſe they

               <p>4. For this objection of being good men, I ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere it at large in another Tractate, wherein I ſhall minde men of many dangers that may ariſe to them from good and eminent men, and fully ſhew what lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſtrength there is in that Reaſon; clearing alſo many things in reference to that Objection.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, I doe in my judgement much allow of bearing and forbearing one another in many differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of opinions and practiſes, ſo as Chriſtians ought <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 3.</note> not to judge nor cenſure one another, nor refuſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and fellowſhip by not admitting men into their Churches and to the Ordinances upon ſuch points (which is the great fault of the Independant Churches, denying communion to many Saints for ſome differences in Judgement about Church govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Orders; which practiſe of theirs is expreſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.) neither to force men to change their mindes and opinions by caſting them violently out of the miniſtry and Church (which was the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of many in theſe late times, and hath cauſed ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Schiſmes and ſtirres amongſt us:) I approve not ſuch practiſes, but deſire to be a follower and lover of all the wayes of peace and Communion, with any who agree in the maine, and have ſomething of God and Chriſt in them: The practiſe of <hi>Anicetus</hi> and <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> with that of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> are infinitely pleaſing to me (and I wiſh they were more imitated) <hi>Polycarpus</hi> and <hi>Anicetus</hi> in the difference about keeping of dayes, though nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them could perſwade the other to change their cuſtome, yet they kept faſt the bond of Chriſtian fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip; <hi>Anicetus</hi> admitting <hi>Polycarpus</hi> to the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Roman Church, and departing in peace

one from the other. <hi>Cyprian</hi> (though he erred in the point of rebaptization) yet he would not condemne them raſhly who were of a contrary opinion, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe Communion with them, profeſſing that for the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of opinions, he would not breake the Lords peace with his Colleagues, nor remove any that was of a different minde from him, from the right of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: So that men may be tolerated in their differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of opinions, ſo long as they keepe Communion with a Church, and ſubmit to the Diſcipline and Orders ſo as to be peaceable and not to ſpeake againſt whats eſtabliſhed by common conſent, nor practiſe to the ſcandall and contempt of the Magiſtrates and Church: But if a few men, halfe a dozen or halfe a ſcore Miniſters, refuſe Communion with a Church, rending from the body, by ſetting up of a Church againſt a Church, Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and venting their opinions every where, to the diſturbance of a Kingdome, and the drawing of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples after them, though they were Miniſters of gold, and had the tongue of men and Angells, yet they ſhould not have a Toleration; upon which ſubject they may read <note n="a" place="margin">

Neither is the authority of men here to bee ſought after, when as the Spirit of God pronounces of ſuch, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 16. That the Church hath no cuſtome of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending.</hi> So that in all this diſcourſe againſt a Tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I have not written out of violence of Spirit, cruelty, or ill will to the men, for I love and reſpect them, (though for the preſent in an errour) but from a zeale to the Glory of God, and the good of this Church
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:157002:38"/>
for the preſervation of purity of doctrine, holineſſe of life and peace, (which cannot ſtand with a Toleration) and though I be earneſt in this cauſe, tis not from ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine apprehenſion or paſſion, for I have had long thoughts of this Church way, and I doe apprehend more evill in it, than men doe ſee at firſt, or than the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependants can ſee, it being their owne cauſe, and they many wayes engaged in it: O that the Independant Miniſters would with an impartiall deſire of ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, conſider what hath beene written, and be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to lay aſide all thoughts of ſetting up ſeparated aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, and come and grow into one body, joyning in one way with us!
