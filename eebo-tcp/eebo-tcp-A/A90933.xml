            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>That it's conceived to be a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent time for to put life and vigour into thoſe of the Reformed Religion, that thereby they might endeavour to recover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

               <p>Why do they not lay hold on the preſent occaſion to joyn with the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> that ſo by his means they may regain their Sixſcore Towns of ſecurity, (which they formerly loſt) as well as their Three hundred thouſand crowns yeerly Revenue, and their places of Judicature to boot?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B. G.</speaker>
               <p>As they loſt them for having ſided with this Prince of <hi>Condé</hi>'s father, (who, after that he had attained unto his own ends, left them at the French King's mercy, to make the beſt Compoſition they could for themſelves at the Treaty of <hi>Loudun)</hi> ſo may you reſt aſſured, that thoſe of the Reformed Religion will never venture to take up Arms againſt their King, in the behalf of any party of their own Nation; nor in reſpect of any Forraigners whatſoever, except for ſuch who minde the propagation of the Goſpel of Chriſt, who intend to knock at <hi>Rome</hi>'s gates, and who will not for any worldly reſpects abandon them.</p>

               <p>Do you conceive that their hopes were well fix'd, and that they were well ſecured, whenas the Duke of <hi>Soubize</hi> was wafted towards <hi>Rochel</hi> and <hi>Ré</hi> by the late Duke of <hi>Buckingham?</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:165984:3"/>
Think you not that it was a like buſineſs to that of <hi>Anthony</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> whenas he was conducted towards <hi>Lisbon</hi> by the Earl of <hi>Eſſex?</hi>

               <p>Thoſe of <hi>Rochel</hi> made Sir <hi>William Beecher</hi> attend half a day at their gates, before they would admit him; for that they were not well aſſured of the reality of that good which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended unto them, as then; nor did there ſo much as one man of thoſe of the Reformed Religion budge after the deſcent at the Iſle of <hi>Ré:</hi> for that none of them (as aforeſaid) will in the leaſt enter into any League with whatſoever parties, unleſs they be qualified as above-ſaid; ſuch who ſhall have aſſured them (by ſuch perſons as may be confided in, on the profeſſion of true Chriſtianity) that they will go thorow-ſtitch with the propagation of the Goſpel's purity; who will not ceaſe till they have knockt at <hi>Rome</hi>'s gates, and who ſhall appear in their own perſons amongſt them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H. P.</speaker>
               <p>As then whatſoever may be conceived of a poſſibility of their ſtirring at preſent, or of their ſiding with the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> muſt even paſs for fair nights dreams, as well as their bruited reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the preſent proceedings in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and on him who appears to be the great <hi>Joſhua</hi> of <hi>Britain,</hi> who (as wiſe men do conceive) ought to be ſought unto: for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did not thoſe of <hi>Rochel</hi> ſend a very conſiderable number of their ſelect members unto King <hi>James,</hi> as well as unto the late King? And did not the States of the United Provinces ſend their great <hi>Barnavelt,</hi> with two more of their Deputies, to ſeek unto Queen <hi>Elizabeth?</hi>

               <p>Nay, did not <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth of <hi>France</hi> ſend unto her? And doth not the Paper-room at <hi>White-hall</hi> contain one of his Letters, bearing theſe very words: <hi>My ſiſter, my ſiſter, if you would have opened your coffers, your brother</hi> Henry <hi>would not have been conſtrained to go to Maſs?</hi> This was a King put to great ſtraights by a Spaniſh League. But in caſe the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>England</hi> ſhould deem fitting to minde the preſervation of thoſe of the Reformed Religion in <hi>France,</hi> you will finde it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether neceſſary to put them ſecretly into a ſtrong and aſſured hope thereof, and of the abetting of them; and to inſinuate the ſame unto them by ſuch as could waft (even from their boſomes, to the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> and his Party) their longing deſires to ſee him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper: As then that Prince and his party would not run the danger

of being gained by Titles and Treaſures, but would ſtick cloſe unto his firſt reſolutions and principles; whereby he would continue to cut out work for the Paraſites and <hi>Sejanus</hi>'s of that Court, to pick their teeths withal.</p>

               <p>It were no hard task to feed the ears of ſome of the French Reformed Preachers with fair hopes, and alſo thoſe who may ſerve as Interlopers.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B. G.</speaker>
               <p>Take my word for it, nothing ſo much hath been the overthrow of that Cauſe, as ſuch ear-feedings, and the over-prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galities of promiſed fair hopes: for that we finde by experience, how that at the greateſt Aſſembly that ever was held of thoſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion in <hi>France,</hi> (at which ſeveral Dukes, Marqueſſes, Barons, and an infinite number of ſuch as were thought to be the very Pillars of the Church, aſſiſted) even as then, Five and twenty of them fell off at a clap, and deſerted the reſt; inſomuch as that they were then called in French, <hi>Le meſchant quartron,</hi> for that they had betrayed the whole party. In the ſame manner, the moſt part of all thoſe who during theſe later Ages were employed by the French (to negotiate with their Neighbours) did alſo betray their parties; as well ſuch as were intruſted to treat for thoſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion, as thoſe who were to treat for the Romane Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, and likewiſe thoſe which were employed by the diſcontented Princes. Finally, thoſe who treated for the late Queen-mother of <hi>France,</hi> and for the preſent Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> during their exiles, ſerved them no better.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>H. P.</speaker>
               <p>By the matter as then I perceive that there is little account to be made of thoſe giddy-brain'd and perfidiouſly-given men, who are ſo much addicted to Whimſies and Romances. And ſhould the Lord's work (which ſolely depends on his providence) be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to ſuch Bunglers, it would ſurely be but in a deſperate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. You ſee how marvelouſly it hath thus far proſpered, by the attendance of the Almighty's providence, by thoſe who have fought under the Banners of Chriſt in this Land. True it is, that weak and earthen veſſels are oftentimes employed in the refining of Gold, even in the moſt violent fires.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B. G.</speaker>
               <p>The ſame Lord who hath been pleaſed to bleſs the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings at home, may alſo do the like in their endeavours to heed thoſe occaſions which are requiſite to be reflected on from abroad;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:165984:4"/>
and may make them ſo ſucceſsful, as that they ſhall not run the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, or need to apprehend the being foiled by the weakneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancie of others. And doubtleſs there may be a great deal of good done (Providence being the Leader) if ſo be theſe preſent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions were heeded; for that thereby, ſundry miſchiefs which are like to enſue, might be prevented. The good which is to be done, might be promoted on the true Principles of Conſcience and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. So likewiſe the preventing of the evil which is apprehended, may be carried on, on the Principles of Self-charity and Juſtice.</p>

               <speaker>B. G.</speaker>
               <p>Why truly I can do it to the purpoſe; for that you muſt of neceſſity grant, how that God himſelf divided the ſpeech of thoſe who went about to build the Tower of <hi>Babel.</hi> He cauſed the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianites</hi> to fight againſt their brethren, in <hi>Gideon</hi>'s days. He ſent a ſpirit of diſſention between <hi>Abimelech</hi> and the <hi>Sichemites,</hi> for that he would deſtroy both the one and the other. He ſuffered a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit to act by the mouth of his own Prophets, for to bring <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi> to a fall in <hi>Ramoth-Gilead.</hi> He permitted <hi>Samſon</hi> to fire the foxes tails, to ſet them on to do miſchief. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf raiſed a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Sadduces and the Phariſees, that ſo he might work his own deliverance. In the like manner, it's void of all doubt, that the Publike Good may be endeavoured with a very ſafe conſcience, although it ſhould be effected by the cauſing of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion amongſt men; yea, although they were neighbours; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch, who<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould they be left at liberty, would ſheathe their ſwords in our own bowels: whenas, in caſe they be prevented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the truth of the Goſpel may thereby have a free paſſage, and ſo conſequently the Kingdom of Chriſt may be advanced; which is the main thing to be minded. As for the acceſſory reſults of ſuch an Undertaking, it muſt needs be granted that it cannot chuſe but be a great advantage for any State to cut out work amongſt its neighbours abroad, that ſo it may have reſt at home: a Maxime which in all times hath been held void of all diſpute, and the which hath ſwayed amidſt all men; not onely thoſe of the firſt Age, and the ſecond, or during the times that <hi>Hannibal</hi> left <hi>Carthage,</hi> to war on the <hi>Romanes,</hi> or whenas the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Thebans</hi> beſtirred themſelves to puzzle the <hi>Spartans;</hi> but even in theſe later Ages, in our grandfathers and fathers days, (the particulars whereof may be

as yet freſh in our memories) <hi>viz.</hi> How that in <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Reign, the French King's, the Emperour's, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s, the <hi>Swedes,</hi> nay and amidſt the States General of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> the ſame hath been found to be a neceſſary courſe, and an uſual practice: whereunto the ſaid King <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond had ſo much accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> to minde and endeavour the embroyling and ſetting by the ears together of all the other Chriſtian Princes, as that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral inhabitants of <hi>Europe</hi> were at length conſtrained to imitate him therein, though not to the ſame extenſion of their conſciences as he did; eſpecially whenas his extreme paſſion, illimitated ambition, and cruel fire-brands, moved him to ſee all his neighbours on fire: nay, he endeavoured to have made uſe of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>var,</hi> (as then of the Reformed Religion) to make war againſt the French King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third; when at the ſelf-ſame time the ſaid King <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond made an agreement with the Infidel <hi>Muley Malucco.</hi> It may therefore (without any further allegations or examples) be maintained, that thoſe who do not much differ in the point of Religion from thoſe of the Reformed Religion in <hi>France,</hi> may lawfully uſe all plauſible means to back and abet them in the advancing of the Kingdom of Chriſt, and in their oppoſing of that Faction which meaneth nought ſave deſtruction unto the <hi>Britains;</hi> and ſo interrupt them in their running alongſt on the Lords provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Thus I have made good the goodneſs, juſtneſs, neceſſity, and plauſibleneſs of the Undertaking.</p>

               <p>Hereunto I anſwer, That as there is nothing ſo inconſtant as a French-man's ſpirit; ſo is there nothing ſo furious in its reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: As for inſtance; the <hi>Flemings</hi> can very well determinate whether the French furies and maſſacres were not far more violent and outrageous then the Spaniſh: although it cannot be denied, but that the <hi>French</hi> will alſo paſſionately love and befriend, where once they are engaged. All which infers, how that there is nothing ſo apparent, as that in caſe the diſcontented French Princes ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that neither thoſe of the Reformed Religion in <hi>France,</hi> nor themſelves (when once engaged) could expect to be countenanced,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:165984:5"/>
abetted, and back'd, they would as then with the more violence haſten to patch up their own domeſtick Jars at any rates, as alſo their forraign Wars with <hi>Spain:</hi> which if they ſhould once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, what can there then be expected, but that they would all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther joyn their malice and forces towards the impediting of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> their deſigne, and ſo unanimouſly proceed to the troubling of the Engliſh Seas? So hath it likewiſe ever been accounted for an infallible truth, that though the French Nation be exceſſively incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ready and capable at each turning of the winde to embroil one another, and to commit moſt egregious overſights; ſo are they as ready and capable to piece up their own differences again, and to finde out Expedients to ſalve over their faults. Moreover, as they are more violent then any other Nations in the hatching of miſchiefs againſt thoſe with whom they fall foul (being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as <hi>Ceſar</hi> obſerves at their firſt onſet more then men) ſo likewiſe are they eaſily pacified, and ſoon reconciled. Wherefore, my concluſion thereon is no other then this, <hi>Viz.</hi> That although Divine Providence ſteers all things on its own ſcore, yet that there is an obligation which may very well to obſerve, and to make good; and that ſame ſeems at preſent to be in ſeaſon; to wit, <hi>That a fair, civil, and hopeful demonſtration might be made of Amity and countenance unto thoſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion in France, and unto the diſcontented Princes:</hi> whenas this following truth will not admit of any gainſaying <hi>viz. How that both of them do conceive that they have ſufficiently expreſt their meanings thereon.</hi>

               <p>By that which I have inſtanced on to ſhew and to unfold; ſo that if you heed it not, it muſt needs lie at your own door: And the which is the leſs to be excuſed, for that in two yeers time the ſaid Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular could not ſo much as be permitted to be repreſented: nor was there ſo much as any notice taken <hi>That the ſame was grounded on Credentials, whereon it was to have been manifeſted.</hi> Beſides, men have not Letters Patents for their lives durance; nor can it be expected, that whenas Parties do not meet with the leaſt encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all for the heeding of their Overtures in fit time, they ſhould as then expect any better ſucceſs on their Proffers, then thoſe who ſowe ſeeds on Ice or Snow.</p>
