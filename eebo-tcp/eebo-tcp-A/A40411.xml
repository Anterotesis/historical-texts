         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104409:3"/>
as the like thereof hath never been heard of, or before this time practiſed amongſt Chriſtian Potentates: We being thereupon deſired to joyn our Forces with thoſe of His Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Majeſty, and cordially to embrace this buſineſs, as concerning the welfare of the general or publique Cauſe, and the re-eſtabliſhment of the Peace, and effectually to relieve His Royal Dignity in theſe undeſerved hoſtilities and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, without any loſs of time.</p>
            <p>And foraſmuch as on the behalf of His above-mentioned Imperial Majeſty, as being the Supream Head and Defender of the Empire, and of the Provinces and Lands thereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing, ſuch a Force is committed unto Us wherewithall to repulſe ſuch violent and oppreſſive attempts; and We are aſſured that His Imperial Majeſty together with the whole Empire, with their united power will endeavour the ſame, and will contribute whatſoever may conduce and be advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious for the repelling of this diſaſtrous miſchief, and for the preſervation of a ſetled peace in the Empire. So it is that We alſo for ſo much as concerneth Us, could not any longer be ſpectators of theſe proceedings which are contrary to the Law of all Nations, and fore-runners of conſequences ſo horrid and highly formidable; But foraſmuch as the buſineſs cannot admit of the leaſt protraction or delay, We have found our ſelves neceſſitated to the utmoſt of our power to maintain His above-mentioned Royal Majeſty, as being a Prince, who is our neighbour and Allie, and whoſe Territories and Subjects being within the Verge of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Roman Empire, are at preſent oppreſſed in ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious manner: And to that end to put in execution that which may tend to the Freedome and Deliverance of the fame, as We have accordingly reſolved, and are already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the Expedition for <hi>Holſteyn</hi> to that purpoſe, with the Forces of His ſaid Imperial Majeſty and our own, and ſhall undertake whatſoever may tend to the preſervation of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104409:4"/>
the oppreſſed, the ſuppreſſing of all hoſtile violence, and reſtauration of a ſetled and aſſured Peace.</p>
            <p>And foraſmuch as this Expedition is not intended for the burthening, or unjuſt oppreſſion of any one, but is only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to the end before expreſſed. So it is, That We do aſſuredly and indubiouſly hope and expect, That by the premiſes all perſons whatſoever may ſufficiently perceive the inevitable neceſſity and moſt weighty Motives which have enforced Us unto this March; and that in conſideration thereof, they will not only acknowledge ſuch our good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, but will alſo to their uttermoſt power ſecond, and as much as in them lieth, promote the reducing of peace and quietneſſe; and eſpecially, without any refuſal, will accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their ability, ſupply whatſoever victuals and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries ſhall be required for the ſubſiſtence of the Imperial, and of our own Armies, thereby to prevent all diſorders and inſolencies: And foraſmuch as We are reſolved generally to obſerve a good and ſtrict Diſcipline, and not to permit any the leaſt inſolency of the Souldiery, but with due and effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual puniſhment to ſuppreſs all diſorders; Therefore all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whatſoever may quietly remain at home both in the Countrey and in the Cities, and there follow their trades and domeſtique occupations, reſting aſſured that they ſhall therein be protected, and need not to fear any inconvenience or damage; and the like good order the Imperial Generals will alſo in all places obſerve and cauſe to be obſerved: And albeit there are ſome ſtrangers of the Poliſh Nation who do accompany theſe Armies, yet there is no juſt occaſion to be afraid of them; but all perſons may reſt aſſured, that on all parts a ſtrict Diſcipline ſhall be obſerved, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beſides neceſſary ſuſtenance ſhall be required; nor ſhall the Souldiery by ſtealing, plundering, burning, or other miſcarriages deſtructive to the Land, incommode or drive away any perſon from his own, but ſhall rather protect, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104409:4"/>
in the beſt manner defend all perſons from and againſt ſuch outrages.</p>
            <p>And as all perſons whatſoever may reſt confident hereof, We do alſo hope that in regard thereof, they will in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces duely behave themſelves, and will without refuſal permit a feee March and re-March in ſuch manner as We ſhall find it expedient, and as it ſhall be ordained by the Generals and Officers, and as the occaſion and reaſon of Warre ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; and that they will not act any thing prejudiciall to our Troopes or Forces, but rather will be aſſiſtant unto them, in all their Enterpriſes and Executions, with all neceſſary help and aſſiſtance; and in purſuance thereof, will demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that they are concerned in the beſt manner to promote the publique Cauſe: But if any contrary to the premiſes, and beyond Our expectation, ſhall offer to make oppoſition againſt Us or Ours, he may impute unto himſelf alone, all ſuch inconveniencies and damages as thereupon ſhall or may accrew unto him. And according to the premiſes, all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Perſon and Perſons are to regulate themſelves: And theſe Preſents being Imprinted and the Copies thereof, ſhall be accounted of equall Validitude with the Originall.</p>
