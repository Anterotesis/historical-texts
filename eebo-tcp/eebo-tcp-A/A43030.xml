         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Bout Chriſtmas laſt, while, full weary of anxious, and in the end not much avai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Solicitude, I endeavoured to render my mind ſerene, and free from that Eclipſe; I addreſſed my ſelf to that Eminent Perſon, the chiefeſt Glory and Ornament of our Colledge, Doctor <hi>Harvey,</hi> at that time reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding not far from the City: and found Him very intent upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrutation of Natures Works, and with a Countenance as cheerful, as Mind imperturbed, <hi>Democritus</hi> like, deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:56144:3"/>
ſearching into the Cauſes of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things. I then inſtantly ſaluted Him, with, Are all Affaires well, and right?</p>
            <p>How can they, <hi>He</hi> gravely anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, when the Common-wealth is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with inteſtine troubles; and I my ſelf as yet far from land, toſt in that tempeſtuous Ocean? And, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly (added <hi>He)</hi> if the comfort of my Studies, and the remembrance of many things, long ſince fallen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my obſervation, were not ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment to my Mind; I know not what could prevaile upon me, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſurvive the preſent. So it hath happened, that this umbratile kind of life, and vacation from publique Cares, which commonly cauſeth a Sadneſs of Mind in others, hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Sovereign Remedy to mine.</p>
            <p>Here I anſwering, ſaid, <hi>Sir,</hi> I ſhall ſoon afford you the Reaſon of that happy Event; which is this: While
<pb facs="tcp:56144:3"/>
the greateſt number of men flatter themſelves with thoughts of growing wiſe, by the notions of others Brains, and (without any addition, unleſs the deceitful Gloſs of different Phraſe, and new Method) with oſtentation obtrude upon the World the Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Ancients; it hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways your choice, about the ſecrets of Nature, to conſult Nature Her ſelfe. And this kind of Study ever hath as leſs of Fallacy, ſo more of Delight: in regard, that frequently, while you are fixt upon the indagation of ſome one thing, many others offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to your obſervation; and ſuch, perhaps, of which you had no thought to enquire. For, your ſelf (I well remember) was pleaſed once to tell me, that you never yet Diſſected any Animal (and, indeed, you have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected very many) but you found in it ſomewhat beyond your expectation, and which you never ſo much as thought of before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56144:4"/>
'Tis true, replied <hi>He;</hi> it hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been the delight of my Genius, to make ſtrict Inſpection into Animals themſelves: And I have conſtantly been of opinion, that from thence we might acquire not only the knowledge of thoſe leſs conſiderable Secrets of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but even a certain Adumbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Supreme Eſſence, the Creator. And, though I was ever ready to acknowledge; that many things have been diſcovered by Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Men of former times: Yet do I ſtill believe, that the number of thoſe things which remain yet concealed in the darkneſs of Imperveſtigable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is incomparably greater: nay, I cannot forbear frequently to wonder, and ſometimes ſmile at thoſe, who perſwade themſelves, that all things were ſo conſummatly and abſolutely delivered by <hi>Ariſtotle, Galen,</hi> or ſome other great Name, as that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was left to the ſuperaddition of
<pb facs="tcp:56144:4"/>
any, that ſucceeded. Nature, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is Her ſelf the moſt faithful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of Her own ſecrets: and what ſhe exhibits, either more brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or more obſcurely, in one kind, the ſame ſhe explains more largely and openly, in another. No man doubtleſs, hath ever rightly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined of the Uſe, or Office of any Part; who hath not in many Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, beheld, and with himſelf di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently conſidered the Fabrick, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, annexed Veſſels, and other Accidents thereof. Thoſe Ancient Oracles of Wiſdom did terminate the knowledge, as of all Countries, ſo alſo of all Animals, Plants, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things whatever, allmoſt with the narrow limits of <hi>Greece</hi> alone: But, to Us the whole Theatre of the World is now open, and, by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity of Travellers, we well know, not only the Place, Habits, and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of its Inhabitants; but alſo,
<pb facs="tcp:56144:5"/>
what Animals, what Vegetables, what Minerals every Region is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed withal. Nor is there any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo Barbarous, which hath not either by chance, or the conſtraint of ſome inevitable neceſſity, found out ſomething for the common uſe and benefit of Mankind, which hath eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the invention of other Nations more Civilized. And ſhal we think that nothing of Commodity can accrue to the ſtock of Sciences, from theſe Helps and Advantages: but that all the Fountains of Wiſdom were drawn dry by the Firſt Ages? Certainly, this Fault is to be imputed to our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Induſtry; not at all to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>To this, another <hi>Evil</hi> hath adjoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it ſelf; which is, that many, wanting the Experimental cognition of things, from the formerly concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved veriſimilitude of ſome Opinion, afterwards boldly broach a poſitive
<pb facs="tcp:56144:5"/>
Judgment thereupon, as if it were certainly known: whereupon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that they are not only groſsly deluded themſelves, but ſeduce o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers alſo (who are not ſufficiently circumſpect) into Error.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and other Diſcourſes of the like importance; flowing from the <hi>Doctor,</hi> with admirable readineſs, as is cuſtomary with Him; I inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Him, ſaying: <hi>Sir,</hi> How free you are from all culpability in this kind, all, who know you, ſufficiently underſtand: and that's the reaſon, why many Learned and Judicious Men, who are acquainted with your Unwearied Induſtry, in the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Philoſophy, greedily expect the Communication of your further Experiments.</p>
            <p>And would you then adviſe me, (ſmilingly replies the <hi>Doctor)</hi> to quit the tranquillity of this Haven, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I now calmly ſpend my days: and
<pb facs="tcp:56144:6"/>
again commit my ſelf to the unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ocean? You are not ignorant, how great troubles my <hi>Lucubrations,</hi> formerly publiſhed, have raiſed. Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is, certainly, at ſome times, to endeavour to grow wiſe at home in private; then by the haſty divulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch things, to the knowledge whereof you have attained with vaſt labour, to ſtirr up Tempeſts, that may deprive you of your Leaſure and Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et for the future.</p>
            <p>Yea but (anſwered I) <hi>to deſerve well, and receive ill, is the uſuall reward of Virtue:</hi> And the Winds, which raiſed thoſe your troubles, have, like the Wind <hi>Caecias,</hi> drawn miſchief upon themſelves. With that, He ſhewed me His <hi>Exercitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, touching the Generation of Animals,</hi> A work framed, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed with very great pains. At ſight whereof, I inſtantly rejoicing, ſaid, I now have obtained what I
<pb facs="tcp:56144:6"/>
earneſtly deſired: and muſt tell you, that, unleſs you impart theſe <hi>Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> to the World, you will both be wanting to your own Honour, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy the Utility of others. Nor ſhall you ſuſtain any further trouble in the Buſineſs; for, whatever of Care is requiſite to the overſight of the Preſs, I ſhall willingly take wholly upon my ſelf. To this <hi>He</hi> condeſcended with much adoe, at firſt urging, among many other Diſſwaſive Arguments, that this His <hi>Tractate</hi> would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, without the conjunction of the <hi>Hiſtory of the Generation of Inſects.</hi> In a word; at length I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed: and <hi>He</hi> ſaid, Loe, I reſign theſe my Writings freely into your hands, with abſolute power, either ſuddainly to publiſh, or for a while to ſuppreſs them, as you ſhall think convenient. Having returned Him very many thanks for ſo high a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; I took my leave, and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:56144:7"/>
as another <hi>Jaſon,</hi> enriched with the Golden Fleece. And when, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my return home, I had ſurveyed the Book; I could not but admire that ſo vaſt a Treaſure had laien ſo long concealed: And that, while o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men arrogate ſo highly to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, onely for the entertainment of their nanſeating Readers, with Trifles and Toies, and Diſhes twice (yea, an hundred times) brought to the Table before; the Modeſty of this Gentleman ſhould be ſuch, as to ſet ſo ſmall a value upon theſe His Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Obſervations. And truly, when ever He hath been pleaſed to give any of his own Inventions leave to ſee the light, He hath not depor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Himſelf with Oſtentation, or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perciliouſneſs, after the cuſtome of many, as if an Oak had ſpoken, or he had deſerved a draught of Hen's-Milk: but, <hi>His</hi> Dictates were Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, and Merits above the reach
<pb facs="tcp:56144:7"/>
of Elogie, or Reward: but, with exceeding Modeſty, as if onely caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, or without any difficultie of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, he had fallen upon the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of thoſe Myſteries, which, indeed, he long ſearched into with profeſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and ſtudy indefatigable.</p>
            <p>And this alſo is an Argument of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Candour in Him; that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver inwades the reputation of any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, but every where delivers his own judgement, in mild and friendly language. For, with him it is Prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bial, <hi>that That Cauſe is worthy to be ſuſpected for ſcarcely good and profitable, which its Author con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends for with brawling and fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> But <hi>Truth can want no Patron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when it was eaſie to him, to have woven this whole Web, from materials of his own; ſuch was his care, for the prevention of Envy, that he yet choſe to follow the clue of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> and <hi>Aquapendens,</hi> as if he
<pb facs="tcp:56144:8"/>
had contributed thereunto no more then meerly the Woofe. Of <hi>Him I</hi> ſhall ſpeak no more, leſt I appear to praiſe to his face a Perſon, whoſe Worth hath advanced Him infinitely above my praiſes; eſpecially to <hi>You,</hi> to whom his Virtue, Candor, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genie, are long ſince very well known. But, of <hi>My ſelfe,</hi> I ſhall adde onely thus much; that in this great Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I have performed no more then the meer office of a Midwife: producing into the light this noble Iſſue of His Brain, in all its parts and line<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ments perfect and conſummate, as it is now preſented to your View; but ſtaying long in the Birth, &amp; fearing, perhaps, ſome injurious Blaſt of Envy or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction. To ſpeak more plainly, I made it my Province to overſee and correct the Preſs; and becauſe the Author writes ſo obſcure a Hand (A thing, as we ſay, common to learned men (as that ſcarce any man, but who hath bin

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince many have requeſted, and ſome have importuned mee; it will not, I hope, be unwelcome, (candid Reader) if what I have obſerved concerning the <hi>Generation of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals,</hi> out of Anatomical diſſections (for I have found the whole matter to be much different, from that which is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, either by Philoſophers or Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians) I expoſe in theſe Exercitations, in favour, and for the uſe of the Lovers of Truth.</p>
            <p>All Phyſitians, following <hi>Galen,</hi> teach, that out of the <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female</hi> mingled in <hi>Coition,</hi> according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant power of <hi>this,</hi> or <hi>that,</hi> the Child reſembles either <hi>this,</hi> or <hi>that Parent,</hi> and is alſo either <hi>Male</hi> or <hi>Female.</hi> And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they pronounce the <hi>Males Seed</hi> to be the <hi>Efficient</hi> cauſe, and the <hi>Females</hi> the <hi>Materiall;</hi> and ſometimes again the clean contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56144:12"/>
But <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (Natures moſt diligent ſearcher) affirms that the <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female</hi> are the <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>Generation,</hi> and that <hi>ſhe</hi> contributes the <hi>matter,</hi> and <hi>he</hi> the <hi>form;</hi> and that forthwith after Coition, there is formed in the Womb out of the Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous bloud, the Vital principle, and firſt particle of the future <hi>Foetus,</hi> (namely, the Heart, in Creatures that have bloud.)</p>
            <p>But that theſe are falſe, and raſh aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, will ſoon appear; and will like clouds inſtantly vaniſh, (when the light of Anatomical diſſection breaks forth) nor will they require any elaborate confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when the Reader, inſtructed by his own eyes, ſhall diſcover the contrary by ocular inſpection; and ſhall alſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, how unſafe, and degenerate a thing it is, to be tutored by other mens com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries, without making tryal of the things themſelves: eſpecially, ſince <hi>Natures Book</hi> is ſo <hi>open,</hi> and <hi>legible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have therefore exhibited to publick view, what in theſe my <hi>Exercitations,</hi> I intend to deliver concerning the <hi>Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Animals;</hi> not onely that poſterity may thence diſcern the certain and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent truth; but alſo, and that cheifly too, that (by revealing the Method I uſe in ſearching into things) I might propoſe to
<pb facs="tcp:56144:13"/>
ſtudious men, a new, and (if I miſtake not) a ſurer path to the attainment of knowledge.</p>
            <p>For although it be a more new and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult way, to find out the nature of things, by the things themſelves; then by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Books, to take our knowledge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on truſt from the opinions of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers: yet muſt it needs be confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that the former is much more open, and leſſe frandulent, eſpecially in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets relating to <hi>Natural Philoſophy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is there any reaſon, why any man ſhould be deterred by the trouble of it; if he will but ſo much as conſider with himſelfe, that even life it ſelfe is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, by the never Wearied Agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Heart. Nor truly would this journy preſent ſo much of ſolitude and deſart to us; did not moſt men by the cuſtome (or fault rather) of the age wee live in, yeilding themſelves up to ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhneſſe, deſire rather to erre with the many, then with the expenſe of their paines and coine, endeavour to be wiſe with the few: when notwithſtanding the <hi>Ancient Philoſophers</hi> (whoſe induſtry alſo even we extol) went a quite contrary way to work; and by indefatigable toile ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching after ſeveral experiments, have ſet
<pb facs="tcp:56144:13"/>
up a clear light to direct our ſtudies. So that, whatever notable and approved thing we have in Philoſophy, it all is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived unto us by the paines and induſtry of ancient <hi>Greece.</hi> Yet when we content our ſelves with their diſcoveries, and calmly believe (which is meer ſleepineſs) that there is now no more place for new inventions, the ſpritely edge of our owne wit languiſheth, and we extinguiſh the lamp which they lighted to our hands. And certainly he alone wil grant, that the whole truth was ingroſſed by the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, (who is ignorant of the many noble diſcoveries, to paſs by other <hi>Arts)</hi> lately found out in the buſineſs of <hi>Anatomy.</hi> And this was cheifly done either by ſuch, who wholly intent upon ſome one thing, did caſually deſcry ſome other: or (which is more commendable) by thoſe, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Natures conduct with their own eyes, have at length through a perplexed, but yet a moſt faithful tract, attained to the higheſt pitch of Truth. And in ſuch an undertaking it is pleaſant, not to be tyred onely, but even to faint away; where the Irkeſomneſs of Diſcovering is abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recompenſed by the diſcovery it ſelfe. We uſe, being covetous of Novelty, to wander far into unknown lands, that our
<pb facs="tcp:56144:14"/>
own eies may witneſs, what our ears have received at ſecond hand: where yet for the moſt part</p>

               </l>
               <l>Our ſight decries report.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Let us then bluſh, in this ſo ample, and ſo wonderful field of nature, (where per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance ſtill exceeds what is promiſed) to credit other mens traditions only, and thence coine uncertain problemes, to ſpin out thorney and captious queſtions. <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> her ſelfe muſt be our adviſer; the path ſhe chalks muſt be our walk: for ſo while we confer with our own eies, and take our riſe from meaner things to high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, we ſhall be at length received into her Cloſet-ſecrets.</p>

               <p>THough there be one onely roade to Science, namely, that by which we proceed from things <hi>more known,</hi> to things <hi>known leſs;</hi> and from that which is <hi>more manifeſt,</hi> to that which is <hi>more obſcure;</hi> and though <hi>Univerſals</hi> are chiefly known to us (for Science is begot by reaſoning

For the ſame things are not both known to us, and ſimply ſo too: wherefore we of neceſſity muſt thus proceed; to wit, from thoſe things which are by nature indeed more obſcure, but yet are more clearer to us; to thoſe things which are more cleare and intelligible by nature. But thoſe things are firſt perſpieuous and manifeſt to us, which are moſt confuſed. Therefore wee muſt goe from Vniverſals to Singulars: for the Whole is more known by ſenſe: now an Vniverſal is a certain Whole.</hi> As that in his Analyticks. <hi>Singulars are more known by</hi>

               <p>That which we have now delivered, hangs very well together, though at firſt it ſeem to claſh: becauſe <hi>Generals</hi> are firſt collected from <hi>Singulars</hi> by <hi>ſenſe,</hi> and ſo farre onely are <hi>more known to us,</hi> as an <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal</hi> is a certain <hi>whole</hi> and <hi>indiſtinct</hi> thing; and that <hi>Whole</hi> is <hi>more known to us</hi> according to <hi>ſenſe.</hi> For though in all knowledge, we begin from <hi>Senſe,</hi> becauſe, (as the Philoſopher ſaid before) <hi>Senſible</hi> particulars are <hi>moſt known to Senſe;</hi> yet <hi>Senſation</hi> it ſelfe is an <hi>Univerſal</hi> thing. For (if you minde it well) though (while we perceive) that which is in the outward organ of ſenſe be a <hi>Singular,</hi> as ſuppoſe, a yellow colour, in the ſight: yet that which is thence <hi>abſtracted</hi> by the <hi>internall ſenſe,</hi> and is judged and apprehended by it, is an <hi>Univerſal.</hi> Hence it comes to paſs, that ſeveral perſons, do at the ſame inſtant, abſtract <hi>divers ſpecies,</hi> and faſhion <hi>ſeverall notions,</hi> even of <hi>one and the ſame Object.</hi> As it is evident in <hi>Poets,</hi> and <hi>Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:</hi> who, though at the <hi>ſame time,</hi> and in the <hi>ſame place,</hi> all circumſtances being alike, they behold <hi>one</hi> and <hi>the ſame Object,</hi> yet each of them, be they never ſo many, expreſs and deſcribe it a <hi>ſeveral way,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb facs="tcp:56144:15"/>
to the ſeveral <hi>Ideas</hi> which they have drawn in their <hi>Phanſie.</hi> So that a Painter being to draw any one mans pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, though he take a thouſand ſeveral draughts, will make them all <hi>diſtinct fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi> and them too not onely differing from each other, but from the Archetype it ſelfe: yet with ſo ſmall diſtinction, that if you look upon each of them apart, you will think hee ſtill brings the ſame piece hee brought before: and yet ſet them all together and compare them, and you will plainely diſcover a difference. Now the reaſon of all this is, that in <hi>Ui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> or the <hi>act of Seeing,</hi> each particular by it ſelfe was <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>diſtinct:</hi> which very particular, the Object being remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, (as ſuppoſe you ſhould ſhut your eies,) abſtracted in the <hi>Phanſie,</hi> or laid up in the <hi>Memory,</hi> is preſented <hi>obſcure,</hi> and <hi>confuſed:</hi> nor is it any longer apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a <hi>particular,</hi> but as ſome <hi>General</hi> and <hi>Univerſal thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſubtilty <hi>Seneca</hi> doth elegantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 58.</note> according to <hi>Plato's</hi> opinion. <hi>An Idea,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is an eternal Exemplar of Natural things. I will explain this definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that you may conceive it the better. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I intend to draw your picture, you your ſelf are the Exemplar of that picture, from</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:56144:16"/>
                  <hi>whom my minde takes a repreſentation, which ſhe indeavoureth to pattern in her work. So then your face, which is my director, &amp; which I labour to repreſent, is the Idea.</hi> And a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after, he ſaith. <hi>In my diſcourſe even now I made uſe of a picture-drawer, to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate what I was ſpeaking of. He, when he would paint</hi> Virgil, <hi>his eye is upon</hi> Virgil <hi>himſelf:</hi> Virgils <hi>face is his Idea, and the Exemplar of his future deſigne: now that which the Artiſt takes from this Idea, and worketh off, is the Picture. If you demand the difference between theſe two, it is this: the one is the Pattern, the other is the copy ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Pattern, and layed upon the work: He imitates the one, and makes the other. A Statue hath a face, but that face is but the</hi> Idos, <hi>or repreſentation: But the Exemplar which the Statuary copies out, hath a face, and that face is the Idaea. Doe you deſire a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther explication? take it thus. The</hi> Idos <hi>is that which you ſee in the piece: the Idea is quite without the piece, and not onely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, but alſo had a being before the piece was at all.</hi> For thoſe things that have been formerly obſerved, and either by uſe, or cuſtome have taken deep root in the minde of the Artificer, doe conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute art it ſelfe, and the Operative Habit: for <hi>Art it ſelf is nothing but the reaſon of the</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:56144:16"/>
                  <hi>work, implanted in the Artiſts minde.</hi> And the ſame way by which we gaine an <hi>Art,</hi> by the very ſame we attain any kinde of <hi>ſcience</hi> or <hi>knowledge</hi> whatever: for as <hi>Art</hi> is a habit whoſe <hi>object</hi> is ſomething to be <hi>done;</hi> ſo <hi>Science</hi> is a habit, whoſe <hi>object</hi> is ſomething to be <hi>known:</hi> and as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer proceedeth from the <hi>imitation of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplars;</hi> ſo this latter, from the <hi>knowledge of things naturall.</hi> The Sourſe of both is from ſenſe and experience; ſince it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that <hi>Art</hi> ſhould rightly be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by the one, or <hi>Science</hi> by the other, without a direction from <hi>Ideas.</hi> Yet in both Art &amp; Science too, that thing which in ſenſible objects wee perceive, differs from the perception it ſelf, which is kept in the <hi>memory,</hi> or <hi>imagination.</hi> That, is the <hi>exemplar,</hi> the <hi>Idea,</hi> the <hi>forme inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> this, the <hi>Repreſentation,</hi> the <hi>Idos,</hi> the <hi>abſtracted Species.</hi> That, is a <hi>natural thing,</hi> a <hi>real entity;</hi> this, a <hi>reſemblance,</hi> or <hi>ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> and an <hi>ens rationis.</hi> That, is imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about ſome <hi>particular</hi> thing, and is it ſelfe a <hi>ſingular,</hi> and an <hi>individual;</hi> this, is a kinde of <hi>univerſal</hi> and <hi>common</hi> thing. That, is in every <hi>Artiſt</hi> and <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> a <hi>ſenſible</hi> thing, <hi>clear,</hi> and <hi>perfect;</hi> this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the <hi>mind,</hi> and is <hi>obſcure.</hi> For what wee diſcover by <hi>ſenſe,</hi> is much more <hi>ſure</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:56144:17"/>
and <hi>manifeſt,</hi> then what we diſcover by the <hi>Intellect:</hi> becauſe the latter ſprings from the former, and is illuſtrated by it. To conclude, <hi>Senſible</hi> Objects are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and before <hi>Intelligible;</hi> but <hi>Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible</hi> are after them, and ariſe from them: nor can we attain to them at all, without <hi>their</hi> help.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it is, that our <hi>judgement</hi> er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth about phantaſmes and apparitions compriſed in our minds, unleſs <hi>ſenſe</hi> give a right verdict, eſtabliſhed upon frequent obſervations, and infallible experiments. For in every <hi>Science,</hi> be it what it will, a diligent obſervation is requiſite, and <hi>Senſe</hi> it ſelf muſt be frequently conſulted. We muſt not (I ſay) rely upon other mens experience, but on our owne; without which, no man is a proper diſciple of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of natural knowledge; nor a competent judge of what I ſhall deliver concerning <hi>Generation;</hi> for without expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentall skill in Anatomy, he will no better apprehend it, then a man <hi>born blind</hi> can judge of the nature and difference of <hi>colours;</hi> or one born <hi>deaf,</hi> of <hi>Sounds.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (diſcreet Reader) truſt nothing I ſay, about the <hi>Generation of Animals;</hi> I appeale to none but thine eyes. For ſince every perfect <hi>Science</hi> builds upon thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:56144:17"/>
                  <hi>Principles,</hi> which it finds out by <hi>Senſe:</hi> we muſt have a ſpecial care, that by cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſſections, we be ſure thoſe <hi>Principles</hi> are ſafely grounded. If we do otherwiſe, we may get a tumid and floating opinion: but never a ſolid and infallible <hi>knowledge:</hi> As it happeneth to thoſe, who ſee forraign countries only in <hi>Mapps,</hi> and the bowels of men falſly deſcribed in <hi>Anatomical tables.</hi> And hence it comes about, that in this rank age, we have many <hi>Sophiſters,</hi> and <hi>Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrights;</hi> but few <hi>wiſe men,</hi> and <hi>Philoſophers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus much I thought fit to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe as a Taſt, that you may underſtand, by what helps I my ſelf was aſſiſted, and upon what conſideration I was induced to communicate theſe my Obſervations, and Experiments: and that you treading the ſame path, may be able not onely to be in equitable Umpire between <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> &amp; <hi>Galen,</hi> but alſo forſaking al ſubtleties; and probable conjectures, and viewing Nature in her own glaſs, may ſearch out many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things yet unrevealed, and perhaps more precious.</p>

manner how knowledge is acquired. For having taught, that all <hi>certain knowledge</hi> is gained by <hi>Syllogiſm,</hi> and <hi>Demonſtration;</hi> and that all <hi>demonſtrative Syllogiſmes,</hi> are built upon ſome <hi>firſt, true,</hi> and <hi>neceſſary principles;</hi> he at laſt inquires, <hi>how princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples become known, and what is that notify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing habit;</hi> as alſo, <hi>whether habits are begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, ſince they were not in us before; or elſe, whether they lurked conceal'd, in caſe they were in us? We have not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>thoſe habits; for it happens that they are hid from thoſe who acquire more exquiſite knowledge by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration. But if we receive them, when we had them not before, how ſhould we make it known, and how ſhould we learn out of a non-preceding knowledge? It is plaine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we have them not, and that they are not in us, and we not know of them; and that they cannot be begotten in men that have yet no habit at all. Wherefore it neceſſarily follows, that we have ſome power to attain them, and yet not ſuch a one as is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and exquiſite then they. Now this ſeems to be a common thing to all creatures living: to have a connate power of Judging, which is called Senſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now ſince they have Senſe, ſome of them retain in them the things they perceive by ſenſe, and ſome not. They who retain not,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:56144:19"/>
                  <hi>have either no knowledge at all, or elſe no knowledge of what they do not retain, beyond the bare ſenſation it ſelf. Others do retaine in their Soul ſomething of what they perceive. And ſince there are many ſuch, they are thus differenced; that in ſome there doth reſult a certain diſcourſe from the memory of things retained, and in ſome not. By Senſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore memory is made, as we ſay; and out of a frequent remembrance of the ſame thing, is experience made: (for many numerical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances, are one Experience) but out of Experience, or an Univerſal reſting in the ſoul (namely out of one, which is diſtinct from the many particulars, and is one and the ſame in all of them) is raiſed a Principle of Art, and Science: of Art, if it relate to Generation; (that is, to doing, or effecting;) of Science, if it appertain to that which is, (that is, to the knowledge of an Entity ſimply;) ſo that the habits we ſpeak of, are neither naturally in us, neither are they made out of other habits more known, but they proceed from Senſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which words of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> it evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears, by what <hi>Order</hi> the knowledge of any <hi>Art,</hi> or <hi>Science</hi> is attained: Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by <hi>Senſe</hi> there remains an <hi>impreſſion</hi> of the thing perceived: by that <hi>impreſſion</hi> is made a <hi>remembrance</hi> of it, and from <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied memory,</hi> proceeds <hi>Experience:</hi> from
<pb facs="tcp:56144:19"/>
                  <hi>Experience, Univerſal Reaſon, Definitions, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes,</hi> or <hi>common Axioms,</hi> which are the moſt certain <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>knowledge.</hi> As for example, <hi>The ſame thing, under the ſame capacity cannot poſſibly be, and not bee. Every Affirmation, or Negation, is either true or falſe;</hi> and ſo forth.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, as we ſaid before, no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect knowledge, which may be called ours, is <hi>in us;</hi> but ſuch as is in ſome ſort <hi>derived to us</hi> from <hi>Experience,</hi> and <hi>Senſe;</hi> or is at leaſt examined, and approved by them, and ſtrongly grounded upon ſome <hi>knowledge pre-exiſtent</hi> in us. For without memory, there can be no experience, which is nothing elſe but a <hi>multiplied me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory:</hi> neither can <hi>memory</hi> bee, without a <hi>remaining impreſſion</hi> of the ſenſative ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and the object cannot remaine, where it never was.</p>
               <p>The great Dictator of Philoſophy hath <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Metaph. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note> another paſſage to this purpoſe. <hi>All men naturally deſire knowledge. And this is evidenced, by the love of our Senſes: amongſt which we prefer the ſight; becauſe this chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conveyeth knowledge to us, and diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth beſt of things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now naurally Animals are ſenſative: but ſome of them remember not what they perceive by ſenſe, and ſome do. And for this cauſe</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:56144:20"/>
                  <hi>ſome are prudent, ſome are more capable of diſcipline then others that remember not. Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, without being taught; as all thoſe that have not the ſenſe of hearing, as Bees, and all ſuch other kinds of creatures; But all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures may be taught which have both memory, and hearing too.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore other creatures have phanſies, and memories, but have no title to experience. But Men have Arts, and Ratiocination. And to them experience comes by remembrance: for many recordations of the ſame thing, make one Experience. Wherefore experience ſeems much of kin to Art, and Science. For by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience men gain both Art and Science. For Experience begets Art</hi> (as <hi>Polus</hi> rightly notes) but Inexperience, Chance.</p>
               <p>By which he clearly ſhews, that no man <note place="margin">Apud. Plat. in Gorgiâ.</note> can be truely called <hi>prudent,</hi> or <hi>knowing,</hi> who doth not by his own experience (at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by manifold remembrance, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſenſation, and diligent obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation) know things to be ſo. For without that, we think onely, or beleive: and ſuch a knowledge as that, is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted other mens, rather then our owne. Wherefore fond and erroneous is that Method of ſeeking truth, in uſe in our times: while moſt men diligently inquire, not what the truth is, but what other men
<pb facs="tcp:56144:20"/>
ſay it is: and inferring Univerſal conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from particular premiſſes, &amp; thence ſhaping to themſelves irrational deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they tranſmit to us things like truth, for truth it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that Sophiſters and halfe-knowing men, polling other mens inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſaucily impoſe them upon us for their own; (ſhifting onely the phraſe and order, and adding ſome impertinencies of their own) and render Philoſophy (which ought to be clear and perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) obſcure, intricate, and confuſed. For whoſoever they be that read authors, and do not, by the aid of their own Senſes, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract true repreſentations of the things themſelves (comprehended in the authors expreſſions) they do not reſent true <hi>Ideas,</hi> but deceitful <hi>Idols,</hi> &amp; <hi>Phantaſms;</hi> by which means they frame to themſelves certaine <hi>ſhadows</hi> and <hi>Chimaera</hi>'s, and all their <hi>theory</hi> and contemplation (which they count <hi>Science)</hi> repreſents nothing but <hi>waking mens dreams,</hi> and <hi>ſick mens phrenſies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Give me leave therefore to whiſper this to thee (friendly Reader) that thou be ſure to weigh all that <hi>I</hi> deliver in theſe <hi>Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, touching the Generation of living Creatures,</hi> in the ſteady ſcale of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and give no longer credit to it,
<pb facs="tcp:56144:21"/>
then thou perceiveſt it to be ſecurely bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed, by the faithful teſtimony of thy own eyes. This very thing did <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us to; who when he had diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed much of <hi>Bees,</hi> added at laſt: <hi>That the Generation of Bees is after this manner, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears</hi>

So, for example, A <hi>Man,</hi> was firſt a <hi>Boy</hi> (becauſe from a <hi>Boy</hi> he grew up to be a <hi>Man;)</hi> before he was a <hi>Boy,</hi> he was an <hi>Infant;</hi> and before an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant,</hi> an <hi>Embryo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now we muſt ſearch farther, what hee was in his Mothers Womb, before he was this <hi>Embryo,</hi> or <hi>Foetus;</hi> whether <hi>three bubbles?</hi> or ſome <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>indigested lump?</hi> or a <hi>conception,</hi> or <hi>coagulation</hi> of <hi>mixed ſeed?</hi> or whether any thing elſe? according to the opinion of writers.</p>
               <p>In the ſame manner, before a <hi>Hen</hi> or <hi>Cock</hi> came to perfection, (and that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a perfect Animal, that can beget its like) there was a <hi>Chicken;</hi> before that <hi>Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi> there is ſeen in the egge an <hi>Embryo,</hi> or <hi>Foetus;</hi> and before that <hi>Embryo, Hieronymus Fabricius Aquapendens</hi> hath deſcried the
<pb facs="tcp:56144:22"/>
                  <hi>rudiments</hi> of the <hi>Head, Eyes,</hi> and <hi>Spine</hi> of the <hi>Back.</hi> But where he affirms, that the <hi>Bones</hi> are made before the <hi>Muſcles, Heart, Liver, Lungs,</hi> and all the <hi>Viſcera;</hi> and that all the inward parts ought to exiſt before the outward; he relieth upon probability, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then experience; and laying aſide the verdict of ſenſe, which is grounded upon diſſections; he flies to petty reaſonings borrowed from mechanicks: which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unbeſeeming ſo famous an Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt. For he ought to have told us what daily changes his own eyes had diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the egge, ere ever the <hi>Foetus</hi> came to perfection. Eſpecially ſeeing he profeſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrote the <hi>Hiſtory of the Generation of the Chicken out of the Egge;</hi> and hath deſcribed in pictures what progreſs is made from day to day. It was, I ſay, befitting ſo much diligence, to have acquainted us from the allegation of his own ſight, what things in the egge are made firſt, what laſt, and what happen together: and not to have confined himſelf to the example of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Ships, and Houſes, to render a clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy conjecture and perſwaſion only, of the order, and manner of forming the parts.</p>
               <p>We therefore (according to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod propoſed) will explaine, firſt in an <hi>Egge,</hi> and afterwards in other <hi>Conceptions</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:56144:22"/>
of ſeveral creatures, what is conſtituted <hi>firſt,</hi> and what <hi>laſt,</hi> in a moſt miraculous order, &amp; with a moſt inimitable prudence and wiſdome, by the great God of nature; and at length we will diſcover, what we have found out, concerning the <hi>firſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> out of which, and the <hi>firſt efficient</hi> by which, the <hi>foetus</hi> is made, as alſo of the <hi>order</hi> &amp; <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of <hi>Generation:</hi> that thence we may attain to ſome infallible know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of each faculty of the formative and vegetative <hi>Soul,</hi> by the effects of it; and of the nature of the <hi>Soul</hi> it ſelfe, by the <hi>parts,</hi> or <hi>organs of the body,</hi> and their functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Now this indeed we could not perform in all kind of <hi>Animals;</hi> becauſe ſome of them cannot be gotten; and others again are ſo exceeding ſmall, that our eyes can hardly diſcern them.</p>
               <p>Let it ſuffice therefore that we have done it in ſome creatures, which are more known to us; to whoſe platform, the firſt originals of all other creatures may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. We have made choice therefore of ſuch, as might render the credit of our experiments leſſe queſtionable, namely larger, and perfecter creatures, and ſuch as are within our own power. For in the larger creatures, all things are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous;
<pb facs="tcp:56144:23"/>
in the perfecter, more diſtinct; and in thoſe that are in our own power, &amp; converſant amongſt us, more obvious: ſo that we have liberty (at pleaſure) by ſearching into them, to reſcue our obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations from wavering heſitation. And of this ſort, in the race of <hi>Oviparous</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, are Hens, Geeſe, Pigeons, Ducks Eiſhes, Shel-fiſh of both kinds (as Lob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Oyſters, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> Fiſhes that have no ſhells at all, Frogs, Serpents: alſo Infects, as Bees, Waſpes, Butterflies, Silkworms. And of <hi>Viviparous,</hi> Sheep, Goats, Dogs, Cats, all Cattel that divide the Hoofe; and in chief, the perfecteſt of all creatures, Man himſelf.</p>
               <p>Having thorough inſight &amp; knowledge of theſe things, we may then contemplate the abſtruſe nature of the <hi>Vegetative Soul;</hi> and diſcern in all creatures what ever, the <hi>manner, order,</hi> and <hi>cauſes of their Generation:</hi> becauſe all other creatures agree either <hi>generically,</hi> or <hi>ſpecifically</hi> with the fore-ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or at the leaſt with ſome of them; and are procreated after the ſame manner of generation, or elſe in a manner proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to it. For <hi>Nature</hi> being divine, and perfect, is always conſonant to her ſelf in the ſame things. And as her works do ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther agree or differ (namely in kind, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
<pb facs="tcp:56144:23"/>
or ſome analogy) ſo her operation (that is to ſay, generation or Fabrick) is the ſame or different in them. Whoever entereth this new, and unfrequented path, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires for truth in the vaſt volume of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> by Anatomical diſſections, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments, he meets with ſuch a croud of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, and thoſe too in ſuch exotick ſhapes, that to unfould to others the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries himſelf hath diſcovered, will bee more toyl, then the finding of them out: for many things occurr which have yet no name; ſuch is <hi>the plenty of things, and the dearth of words.</hi> So that if a man ſhould cloath them in Metaphors, and expreſs his new inventions by old words, and ſuch as are in uſe: the Reader could no more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them, then <hi>canting:</hi> and would never be able to comprehend the buſineſs, ſince he never ſaw it.</p>
               <p>And then again to mint up new and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitious terms, would rather caſt a miſt, then enlighten. For ſo he muſt needs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs things unknown, by that which is leſſe known: and the Reader would be more afflicted to unriddle the <hi>words,</hi> then to underſtand the <hi>matter.</hi> And therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> by unexperimented perſons is thought obſcure: And this perhaps was the reaſon, why <hi>Fabricius ab Aquapendente</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:56144:24"/>
choſe rather to deſcribe the Fabrick of the Chicken in the Egge by <hi>tables</hi> then <hi>words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore be not offended, Courteous Reader, if in ſetting out the <hi>Hiſtory of an Egge,</hi> and in the deſcription of <hi>the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Chicken,</hi> I make uſe of a new me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, and ſometimes of unuſual terms; nor think me hereby more deſirous of vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, then of advantaging others by true experiments, and ſuch as are groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Natures ſelf. To take off that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, know, I tread but the ſteps of other men who have lighted me the way, and (ſo farre as is fit) I make uſe of their noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But in chief, of all the <hi>Ancients,</hi> I follow <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> and of the later Writers, <hi>Hieronymus Fabricius ab Aquapendente,</hi> Him as my <hi>General,</hi> and This as my <hi>Guide.</hi> For as they which finde out <hi>new Plantations,</hi> and <hi>new Shores,</hi> call them by names of their own coyning, which <hi>Poſterity</hi> afterwards accepts and receives; ſo thoſe that finde out <hi>new Secrets,</hi> have good title to their compellation.

            </p>
            <p>But we begin our diſcourſe from the hiſtory of an Egge, both for the reaſons by him recited, and likewiſe, becauſe we may thence borrow more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible grounds, which (in regard they are more

               <hi>Fabricius</hi> goes on: <hi>That the contemplation of fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the</hi> foetus <hi>out of Egges is the largeſt of all, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in this, that the greateſt part of animals are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of egges.

Here again <hi>Fabricius: The productions of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals do ſome of them ſpring out of Egges, ſome out of Seed, and ſome out of Putrifaction; and hence it is, that ſome are called oviparous, ſome viviparous, others the iſſues of putrifaction, or creatures born of their own accord; by the Greeks,</hi>

               <hi>NAture</hi> (ſaith <hi>Fabricius) was firſt ſolicitous of the place, which ſhe at length decreed to be either within the Animal, or without it; and appointed the womb to be the place, within the creature; but without, the egge: in the womb, nature generates of ſeed and blood; but, in the egge, of ſuch parts as the egge is made of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For whatſoever is begotten of ſeed properly ſo called, is begun, and perfected, either in the <hi>ſame</hi> place, or in a <hi>diverſe.</hi> All <hi>Viviparous</hi> creatures have both their original and perfection in the <hi>womb</hi> it ſelf; but all <hi>Oviparous,</hi> as they have their founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion within their <hi>parent,</hi> and there become an <hi>egge;</hi> ſo are they compleated into a <hi>foetus,</hi> when they are divided from their <hi>parent.</hi> And, in the Catalogue of theſe, ſome creatures continue their <hi>eggs</hi> ſo long within themſelves, till thoſe <hi>eggs</hi> be ripe, and accompliſhed: and thus doe <hi>Birds</hi> and <hi>Beaſts</hi> too, as many as bring forth <hi>eggs;</hi> and <hi>ſerpents</hi> likewiſe. But others againe expoſe their <hi>ſeed</hi> whiles it is yet unperfect and immature, to acquire its growth, perfection, and ripeneſs from abroad: and thus do many ſorts of <hi>Fiſhes, Froggs;</hi> alſo <hi>Fiſhes</hi> without ſcales, and both ſorts of <hi>Shell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh,</hi> and <hi>Snails,</hi> whoſe <hi>eggs,</hi> when firſt excluded, are but <hi>deſignes</hi> or <hi>beginnings,</hi> being <hi>yolks</hi> onely, which do afterward inveſt themſelves with <hi>whites,</hi> and by degrees attracting, concocting, and affix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aliment to themſelves, become perfect <hi>ſeed,</hi> and a compleat <hi>egge</hi> And of this kinde alſo is the

The ſeat of the <hi>Ovary</hi> is next under the <hi>Liver</hi> at the ſpine of the back, above the <hi>deſcending trunk</hi> of the <hi>great Artery.</hi> For juſt in that place where in bigger ſangineous creatures, the <hi>Coeliacal arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> goes into the <hi>Meſentery,</hi> namely, at the original of the <hi>Emulgent</hi> veines, or a little lower; and in that place where the <hi>preparing ſeed veſſels</hi> which go down to the <hi>Teſticles</hi> have their riſe, in all other ſanguineous &amp; viviparous creatures; &amp; where alſo the cock wears his <hi>Teſticles,</hi> there is the Hens <hi>Ovary</hi> found.

ſuch miſchance in <hi>Birds,</hi> their midriffe is <hi>membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,</hi> and exceeding advantagious to the work of <hi>reſpiration;</hi> and for this cauſe they are ſaid to have a <hi>diaphragma.</hi> Moreover, were birds quite deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of a <hi>diaphragma,</hi> yet <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> were not to be blamed, for ſaying, That <hi>Eggs</hi> receive their firſt ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment at the <hi>ſeptum tranſverſum;</hi> for by this name he onely points at the place where the <hi>diaphragma</hi> is commonly found in other <hi>Animals.</hi> So we alſo ſay, that the <hi>Ovary</hi> is ſcituate at the beginning of the <hi>preparing ſpermatical veſsels,</hi> though a <hi>Henne</hi> hath no ſuch veſſels at all.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Perforation</hi> of the <hi>Lungs,</hi> by me firſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered (of which I made mention but now) is in no ſort dark and obſcure; but, in <hi>Birds</hi> eſpecially, very patent: ſo that in an <hi>Oſtrich</hi> I found many <hi>perforations,</hi> into which I could eaſily thruſt the top of my finger. In a <hi>Turkey,</hi> nay in an <hi>ordinary dunghill Cocke,</hi> and almoſt all <hi>Birds</hi> whatſoever, a probe being put into the <hi>winde-pipe,</hi> will finde an open and wide paſſage, clean through the <hi>lungs</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>cavities</hi> of the <hi>abdomen,</hi> or lower belly. Blow the aire into their <hi>lungs</hi> with a pair of bellowes, and you ſhall finde it haſten into the lower parts, and that not without a ſenſible force.</p>
            <p>Nay, we may very well queſtion whether, even in <hi>man</hi> whileſt he is living, the air doth not pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate into the <hi>cavity</hi> of the <hi>cheſt,</hi> by the aforeſaid paſſages. For could otherwiſe the putrefied mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>impoſtumated,</hi> and the blood ſhut out of the veins of <hi>pleuritical</hi> perſons, flow from thence? How could the aire, when the <hi>breaſt</hi> is wounded (though the <hi>lungs</hi> be untoucht) ruſh out of the wound? or how could <hi>injections</hi> caſt into the <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity</hi> of the <hi>cheſt,</hi> be returned again with the ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle? But of this at large in our <hi>Exercitations,</hi> of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56144:28"/>
the <hi>Cauſes, Inſtruments,</hi> and <hi>Uſe of Reſpiration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I return now to the <hi>Ovary,</hi> and the upper part of the wombe of the Henne; in which the firſt rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Eggs</hi> are conceived, which are (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Ariſtotle)</hi> ſmall at firſt, and white; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, afterwards become of a pale yellow.</p>
            <p>As for this <hi>upper womb</hi> mentioned by <hi>Fabricius,</hi> the truth is, there is no ſuch thing at all, till the <hi>Henne</hi> have conceived, and hath the principles of <hi>Eggs</hi> within her, which may then be properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>cluſter</hi> of wheals. And therefore he ſaith very rightly: <hi>The ſuperiour matrix is nothing elſe but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt an infinite crowd of yolks, which are amaſsed in one heap together, being of a round figure, and of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe magnitude; amongſt which there is a like diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from the greateſt to the leaſt, as between a grane of muſtard-ſeed and a walnut, or a medlar. This mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of yolks are united and knit together as it were upon a bunch: and therefore I call it a Vitellary, or a bunch of yolks, becauſe it much reſembles a bunch of grapes.</hi> As <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> alſo ſaid of fiſhes that want ſcales, where he writes, <hi>That their eggs are laid as if they were glewed together like grapes; for as in a bunch of grapes, the berries are ſome biggeſt, ſome leſs, and ſome leaſt of all, and each is tyed to its proper ſprig, ſo is it in the Vitellary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now in Fiſhes, Frogs, hard or cruſted Shell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh, and Snails, the matter is much otherwiſe; for they contain in them <hi>Eggs</hi> of the ſelf-ſame magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; which being diſcharged, do grow alike, are perfected alike, and at the ſame time produce yong ones. But in the <hi>Ovary</hi> of a <hi>Henne,</hi> and almoſt of all other Oviparous creatures, there is a diſtinct increaſe of the yolkes, from almoſt an inviſible ſmalneſs, till they arrive to a complete magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: though the <hi>Eggs</hi> of <hi>Hennes</hi> (not unlike the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56144:29"/>
eggs of thoſe creatures which conceive and lay their egges together) are hatched into <hi>chickens</hi> in the ſame neſt, almoſt at the ſame time. Yet in <hi>Pigeons</hi> (which lay, and hatch onely <hi>two egges</hi> at a time) I have obſerved all the <hi>Eggs</hi> in the <hi>Ovary</hi> to be of a like magnitude, excepting only thoſe two which were greater then the reſt, and were now ready to deſcend into the <hi>ſecond uterus, or womb;</hi> ſo that of them there is great increaſe, not by the multitude of their young at once, but by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of their repeated births, which happen e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very moneth. So in cartilaginous Fiſhes; as the Thorn-back, the Fork-fiſh, the Dog-fiſh, &amp;c. two eggs are only ripe at a time, and falling down on both ſides from the <hi>right</hi> and <hi>left horn,</hi> they are cheriſhed in the <hi>lower womb,</hi> and exclude their young alive (as the <hi>Viviparous</hi> creatures do:) yet in their <hi>Ovary</hi> they have almoſt an infinite number of <hi>eggs,</hi> and of different dimenſions; in the Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back I have numbered above a hundred.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Eggs</hi> of other <hi>oviparous</hi> creatures are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perfected when they are out of the <hi>womb,</hi> as the <hi>eggs</hi> of <hi>fiſhes;</hi> or at leaſt concocted, as the <hi>eggs</hi> of ſnailes, of hard ſhell-fiſh, and of ſpiders. The ſnailes they treaſure up their eggs in froth; cruſted ſhell-fiſh, (as ſhrimps, cray-fiſh, lobſters) carry them about faſtned to their finnes; but the <hi>ſpider</hi> beareth them about with her, as it were in a baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket wrought of her <hi>webbe,</hi> and ſo cheriſheth them. The <hi>Beetle</hi> wrappeth her <hi>eggs</hi> in dung, (rowling them in it with her hinder leggs) and ſo layeth them up: and, in all theſe, there are an incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number of <hi>eggs. Fiſhes</hi> have two oblong blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or bags, as you may ſee in the Carp, the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and the Smelt; in all which, as there is no womb at all diſcernable, beſides the <hi>Ovary,</hi> ſo is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56144:29"/>
this <hi>Ovary</hi> ſometimes ſo thronged with <hi>eggs,</hi> that it far exceeds the bulk of the whole body beſides.</p>
            <p>Of the <hi>Ovaries</hi> of theſe <hi>Carps</hi> and <hi>Mullets,</hi> amaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed together, and ſalted, and hardned in the ſmoak, is made that kinde of meat ſo much in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt with the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> (called by theſe <hi>Botarcha,</hi> by the <hi>Greeks</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is to ſay, pickled eggs) ſuch as is that which is found in our red <hi>Herrings,</hi> &amp; the red and compacted ſeed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Lobſter. That meat which is made of the ſalted eggs of <hi>Sturgem,</hi> is called <hi>Caviare,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembleth black ſope, and is the delight of glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons.</p>
            <p>In all <hi>fiſhes</hi> (which have a numerous offspring) ſo great abundance of <hi>egs</hi> is generated, that the whole capacity of the belly can hardly contein them, when they are newly conceived, much leſs when they are of any growth. And therefore in <hi>fiſhes,</hi> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their <hi>Ovary,</hi> there is no other part dedicated to generation. For their <hi>eggs</hi> take growth abroad; nor need they any <hi>womb</hi> for that office. And this <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vary</hi> ſeems to carry ſome Analogie to the reſticles, or litle ſeminal bladders, not only becauſe they are found in that place where the <hi>ſtones</hi> are bred in males; (for the <hi>ſtones</hi> in <hi>Cocks</hi> are ſcituate, as we have ſaid, at the ingreſs of the <hi>Coeliacal artery,</hi> neere the midriff, and there the Hens <hi>Ovary</hi> is found) but alſo, becauſe in both ſexes of <hi>fiſhes,</hi> at the time of <hi>generation,</hi> there are two litle bags paſſing through the whole belly, alike in ſite, figure, and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; which increaſing at the ſame time, are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, in <hi>males</hi> with a ſimilary, ſpermatical, and milky ſubſtance, (whence it is called <hi>fiſhes milke)</hi> and in the females, with litle inviſible graines or ſands; ſo that in the beginning of conception (by reaſon of their cloſe fabrick) they look like a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56144:30"/>
body, and like the males milk regularly coagulated, and may afterwards be diſcerned like the ſmalleſt ſands clinging together in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per bags.</p>
            <p>In leſſer Birds (which bring forth egges, and thoſe few ones, but once a year) you will ſcarce finde any <hi>Ovary</hi> at all; but juſt where the <hi>ſtones</hi> hang in males, there in females, inſtead of an <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vary,</hi> are found three or four bubbles (according to the number of <hi>egges,</hi> whoſe foundation they are) as diſcernable as the <hi>teſticles</hi> of the males.</p>
            <p>In the horns of the Serpents womb (which are like the <hi>ſpermatical veſsels</hi> of the males) appear the firſt rudiments of the <hi>eggs,</hi> like litle balls faſtned on a ſtring, as is uſual in womens bracelets, or chaplets of beads made of amber.</p>
            <p>They therefore that are found in the <hi>Vitellary,</hi> or <hi>Ovary,</hi> are not to be counted perfect <hi>eggs,</hi> but the firſt ground-works or rudiments of <hi>eggs,</hi> which are in ſuch order and magnitude diſpoſed in the bunch, that one may daily ſucceed the other, to ſupply the <hi>hennes laying.</hi> But no <hi>egge</hi> in the <hi>Ova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> is cloathed with a white, for onely yolks are found there; which, as they gain growth, get with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſmall ones; that being arrived to a larger room, they may the better thrive and enlarge. And therefore that of <hi>Fabricius</hi> is very true, where he ſaith, <hi>The greater yolks of the bunch are in the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">pag. 3.</note> 
               <hi>the leſser are in the middle, encompaſsed as it were by the greater; laſtly, the leaſt of all lie undermoſt.</hi> For as they get greater bulk by growing, they are ſeparated from their fellowes; which, while it is doing, every <hi>yolke,</hi> beſides his proper coat, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweth another from the <hi>Ovary,</hi> which encompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it without, and tyeth it to the foundation from whence it ſprung: wherefore by <hi>Fabricius</hi> it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56144:30"/>
is called <hi>pediolus, ſive pedunculus,</hi> the ſtalk, becauſe by its means, as the fruit draweth nouriſhment and increaſe from the tree, ſo doth the <hi>yolk</hi> from the <hi>cluſter. For this</hi> ſtalk <hi>is a membranous hollow faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which is extended from the bottom of the cluſter to the yolk: which ſo ſoon as it arrives at, it is dilated, and (juſt as the optick nerve is ſpread in the eye) co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth the yolk with an outward coat. Hence</hi> Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>probably called it</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>that is, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle umbilical appendix, or pipe. This litle ſtalk con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighs</hi> 
               <note place="margin">De Gen. An. l. 3. c. 2.</note> 
               <hi>with it many veſsels into the yolke, through which they are many waies divaricated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things are indeed truly delivered by <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricius,</hi> but he miſtaketh, when he ſaith, <hi>This coat doth not environ the whole yolke, but onely a litle more then half of it, juſt as the cover of an acorn, called the</hi> cup: <hi>whence it cometh to paſs, that the outward part of the yolke, being deſerted by the fore-mentioned mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, is expoſed to the view without veines, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth naked.</hi> For it embraceth all the yolk; but in the outward part of the yolk, it is not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcerned from its own coat, becauſe they both are very thin. But, in the fore-part, where the yolk reſpecteth the foundation of the cluſter, this coat adhereth not to the yolk, neither doth it ſend any veines into it, but only begirts it like a bag.</p>
            <p>Every <hi>yolk</hi> aſſumeth a particular <hi>coat</hi> from the ſame <hi>foundation;</hi> and therefore this place is not to be reputed the <hi>common womb,</hi> ſince no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is here to be found, beſide the <hi>cluſter,</hi> or heap of many <hi>eggs,</hi> of different magnitude, ariſing from the ſame <hi>foundation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this <hi>Foundation</hi> is a <hi>particular body</hi> of it ſelf, ariſing at the <hi>ſpine</hi> of the <hi>Fowle,</hi> annexed to the <hi>great Artery</hi> and <hi>Vein,</hi> being <hi>looſe, porous,</hi> and <hi>fungous,</hi> that ſo it may produce divers <hi>yolks</hi> out of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56144:31"/>
it ſelf, and afford each of them their <hi>coats;</hi> which <hi>coats</hi> do afterwards ſtretch, as the <hi>yolks</hi> enlarge, and incloſe them like a <hi>Bag,</hi> with a narrow neck, but a large belly, in like manner as <hi>glaſs-vials</hi> are faſhioned by the breath of the <hi>Glaſs-maker. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricius</hi> ſaith further; <hi>The yolks, as they ſpring from a very ſmall original, being about the magnitude of the ſeed of Millet, or Muſtard, ſo they are very litle, and white, as</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>obſerves, and do alſo increaſe by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; and, as the ſame</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>ſaith, grow like yolks, and yellow, till they attain the juſt magnitude which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very body knoweth them to be of.</hi> But I have obſerved them to be much leſs then the ſeeds of <hi>Millet,</hi> even as ſlender as the ſmalleſt <hi>wheals,</hi> or <hi>ſpots,</hi> or <hi>ſands,</hi> (ſuch as I have told you are found in the <hi>Ovaries</hi> of <hi>Fiſhes)</hi> ſcarce to be diſcovered by the eye it ſelf, as if they were onely the <hi>ruggedneſs</hi> of the <hi>membranes</hi> of that part from whence they proceed.</p>

            <p>THe next part of the <hi>Womb</hi> of the <hi>Hen,</hi> is by <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricius</hi> called the <hi>Infundibulum:</hi> for it is like a <hi>Tunnel,</hi> or <hi>Trumpet,</hi> tending down-ward from the <hi>Ovdry,</hi> (which it every where encompaſſeth) and growing wider by degrees, is terminated in the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour <hi>production</hi> of the <hi>Womb.</hi>

            <p>A certain <hi>Chirurgion</hi> of my acquaintance, an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man, being returned from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> told me upon his credit, that in the Iſland called <hi>Bornea,</hi> in the Inland and Hilly parts of it, there are a race of <hi>men</hi> born with <hi>Tails,</hi> (as <hi>Pauſanias</hi> writes of another place) and that he ſaw a <hi>Virgin</hi> of that flock, whom they had much ado to catch, (for they are <hi>wilde)</hi> who had a <hi>fleſhy, thick tail,</hi> a <hi>ſpan</hi> long, reflected between her leggs, to conceale her modeſty: ſuch care hath nature to hide thoſe parts.</p>
            <p>The fabrick of this <hi>Covering</hi> in a <hi>Hen,</hi> is like to that of the <hi>upper lid</hi> of the <hi>eye,</hi> compoſed of <hi>skin,</hi> and of a <hi>fleſhy</hi> and <hi>muſculous membrane,</hi> with <hi>fibers</hi> every where drawn from the <hi>circumference</hi> to the <hi>Center;</hi> and its inward <hi>ſuperficies,</hi> like that of the <hi>eye-lid,</hi> and <hi>fore-skin,</hi> is ſoft.

And through this the <hi>egge</hi> alſo paſſing forth, worketh its way.</p>
            <p>The making of this <hi>cavity</hi> is ſuch, as if both the <hi>excrements</hi> deſcended into the <hi>Bladder,</hi> and nature did abuſe the <hi>urine</hi> into a natural <hi>clyſter.</hi> And therefore it is ſomething thicker and ruggeder then the <hi>gut,</hi> and alſo in <hi>ejection</hi> and <hi>coition,</hi> thruſts it ſelf out, (the covering, as I have ſaid, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved) and hangeth out like the inſide of the <hi>gut:</hi> and at that time all the <hi>holes</hi> appear diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; which preſently again upon its retraction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing collected as it were into a <hi>purſe,</hi> are hidden out of ſight.</p>

            <p>All <hi>Birds, Serpents, Four-footed beaſts,</hi> which are <hi>Oviparous,</hi> and <hi>Fiſhes</hi> alſo, (as is evident in <hi>Carps)</hi>

But <hi>Birds,</hi> and <hi>Serpents,</hi> whoſe <hi>Lungs</hi> are <hi>fungous,</hi> have but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry litle <hi>urine;</hi> becauſe they <hi>drink</hi> but litle, and that by <hi>ſips;</hi> and therefore they need no <hi>Bladder</hi> of Urine, but do depoſit it (as we have ſaid) into the common <hi>ſink</hi> and <hi>receptacle</hi> with the dryer <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements.</hi> But in <hi>Carps,</hi> and ſome other <hi>fiſhes</hi> I have found a <hi>Bladder of Urine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a <hi>Hen,</hi> the <hi>Ureters</hi> deſcend form the <hi>Kidnies</hi> on both ſides, (which <hi>Kidnies</hi> are large and ample and ſeated in the cavity or hollow of the back and do end in the <hi>cavity</hi> or <hi>common ſink.</hi> But their

Out-let is ſo obſcure, and concealed in the very entrance of the <hi>cavity,</hi> that to diſcover it from without, or to ſearch it with the moſt ſlender probe, is altogether impoſſible. Nor is it indeed any great wonder; for in all creatures, even in the greateſt of all, the inſertion of the <hi>Ureters</hi> neer the neck of the <hi>Bladder,</hi> is dark and winding, that (though <hi>urine,</hi> nay and <hi>ſtones</hi> too do ſometimes glide through them into the <hi>bladder)</hi> not ſo much as the <hi>aire</hi> it ſelfe can go back that way, nor the <hi>urine,</hi> be it never ſo much forced.</p>
            <p>All theſe things are clear in an <hi>Oſtrich;</hi> in which I have found, beſide the <hi>outward orifice</hi> of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>cavity,</hi> which was vailed by the <hi>Covering;</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other orifice within the <hi>Fundament,</hi> which was round and gathered up, and ſhut as it were with a <hi>ſphincter muſcle.</hi> But to paſs <hi>theſe,</hi> and return to our <hi>purpoſe.</hi>

            <p>But I have often obſerved, that the <hi>Hen</hi> doth indifferently incline her <hi>back</hi> parts towards the <hi>Cock,</hi> on which <hi>ſide ſoever</hi> he prepare his aſcent, be it on the right or left. I finde no <hi>Penis,</hi> or <hi>Yard</hi> at all in a <hi>Cock,</hi> neither could <hi>Fabricius</hi> finde any, though it appear moſt manifeſt in <hi>Drakes,</hi> and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56144:35"/>
               <hi>Ganders.</hi> But, inſtead thereof, I finde an <hi>Orifice</hi> in a Cock (not different from that of a <hi>Hen)</hi> but it is <hi>leſs,</hi> and <hi>narrower;</hi> which <hi>Orifice</hi> is like wiſe found in the <hi>Swan,</hi> the <hi>Drake,</hi> and the <hi>Gander:</hi> but the <hi>Penis</hi> of the <hi>Drake</hi> and <hi>Gander</hi> (in the act of <hi>Coiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)</hi> is ſent out of this <hi>orifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a black <hi>Drake,</hi> I ſaw a <hi>Penis</hi> of that extent, that after coition, the <hi>Duck</hi> purſued it as it trailed upon the ground, with intent to devour it; (deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as I ſuppoſe, that it had been a <hi>worm)</hi> which occaſioned the <hi>Drake</hi> to retract it ſooner then his cuſtom is.</p>
            <p>In a <hi>Male-Oſirich,</hi> I found, within this orifice of the <hi>Privy-parta</hi> a very large <hi>glans,</hi> or <hi>nut of the yard,</hi> and a <hi>ruddy nerve,</hi> of the form and magnitude of a <hi>Deers tongue,</hi> or ſmall <hi>Neats tongue;</hi> which I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved him many times brandiſh in <hi>coition,</hi> ſtiffe, and ſomething embowed: which, when he had diſpatched into the <hi>female,</hi> he detained there a good ſpace, without any commotion of theſe parts at all, as they had been ſtaked together; yet all the while ſtrange were the geſticulations of their <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Necks</hi> (as if they had approved their <hi>Nuptials)</hi> proclaiming their full compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</p>
            <p>I have read in <hi>D. du Val,</hi> a moſt learned Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian of <hi>Rouen,</hi> that a certain <hi>Hermaphrodite</hi> was delivered up to the <hi>Chirurgians</hi> and <hi>Midwives,</hi> to determine whether he was a <hi>Man</hi> or a <hi>Woman.</hi> They, upon diſcovery, judged him to be a <hi>woman;</hi> and thereupon he was enjoined to habit himſelfe like one of that ſex. He notwithſtanding was in the mean time accuſed of ſoliciting women, and playing the <hi>mans part.</hi> And at laſt he had a <hi>penis</hi> iſſuing out of its <hi>hidden prepuce,</hi> (as out of a <hi>wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> ſecrets) which executed the <hi>mans</hi> office.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:56144:35"/>
I my ſelf once ſaw a mans <hi>penis</hi> ſo ſhrunk up (excepting onely when it was provoked) that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appeared in the wrinkled <hi>prepuce</hi> above the <hi>ſcrotum,</hi> but the meer extremity of the <hi>Glans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a <hi>Horſe,</hi> and ſome other creatures, the vaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſion of that part is ſhut forth from <hi>within.</hi> In a <hi>Mole</hi> alſo, that litle <hi>Animal,</hi> there is a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the <hi>penis</hi> into the <hi>skin</hi> and <hi>muſcles</hi> of the <hi>Abdomen;</hi> and his <hi>female</hi> alſo hath a <hi>longer</hi> and <hi>deeper Matrix</hi> then is uſual.</p>
            <p>I conceive, it is with a <hi>Cock,</hi> who hath no <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> as it is with the leſſer ſort of <hi>Birds;</hi> which quickly conclude their acts of <hi>coition,</hi> and do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them by <hi>affriction</hi> onely. For the <hi>Orifices</hi> of the <hi>Privities</hi> (of the <hi>Cock</hi> and <hi>Hen)</hi> by often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, as by repeated ſalutes, do celebrate <hi>coi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> not by one continued <hi>inition,</hi> (which <hi>orifices</hi> being turned outward, do protuberate, wax ſtiffe, and ſtretch after the manner of a <hi>Glans;</hi> eſpecially that of the <hi>Cock,</hi> which onely doth outwardly preſs upon the <hi>female,</hi> and, as I ſuppoſe, doth not enter in.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Coition</hi> of <hi>Horſes, Dogs,</hi> and <hi>Cats,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures, when the <hi>male</hi> preſenteth his <hi>penis,</hi> the <hi>female</hi> proportioneth her parts ſtiffe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. And Birds alſo that are tame, ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be gently ſtroked, and ſwelling with <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal</hi> appetite, expoſe that <hi>Orifice,</hi> which you may by your finger perceive to be hardened and reſiſting. Nay ſometimes birds are ſo luſtfull, that if you only gently ſmooth their backs, they will inſtantly incline, and extend and make bare their <hi>Uterine Orifice;</hi> which if your finger ſoftly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with, they will declare their accepted recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in extravagant murmurs, and flutterings of their <hi>wings.</hi> And that the <hi>females</hi> will even thence

conceive <hi>eggs,</hi> both <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> beareth witneſs, and I my ſelf have found in a <hi>Thruſh,</hi> a <hi>Black-bird,</hi> and others: and this experiment I gained long ſince, and by chance, but at my own coſt. For my wife had an excellent, &amp; a well inſtructed <hi>Parrat,</hi> which was long her delight; which was now grown ſo <hi>familiar,</hi> that he was permitted to walk at liberty through the whole houſe: where he miſſed his <hi>Miſtreſſe,</hi> he would ſearch her out, and when he had found her, he would court her with a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>congratulation.</hi> If ſhe had called him, he would make <hi>anſwer,</hi> and <hi>flying</hi> to her, he would graſp her garments with his <hi>claws,</hi> and <hi>bill,</hi> till by degrees he had ſcaled her <hi>ſhoulder;</hi> whence he deſcending by her <hi>arm,</hi> did conſtantly ſeat himſelf upon her hand. If ſhe bad him talk, or ſing, were it <hi>night,</hi> and never ſo <hi>darke,</hi> he would obey her. Many times when he was <hi>ſportive</hi> and <hi>wanton,</hi> he would ſit in her lap, where he loved to have her ſcratch his <hi>head,</hi> and ſtroke his <hi>back,</hi> and then teſtifie his contentment, by kinde <hi>mutterings,</hi> and <hi>ſhaking</hi> of his <hi>wings.</hi> I ſtill interpreted all this to proceed from his cuſtomary <hi>familiarity</hi> and <hi>obſequiouſneſs,</hi> for I alwaies thought him to be a <hi>Cock-Parrat,</hi> by his notable excellence in <hi>ſinging</hi> and <hi>talking.</hi> For amongſt <hi>Birds,</hi> the <hi>females</hi> ſeldom ſing, or provoke to diſcourſe; but the <hi>males</hi> onely charm the <hi>fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males</hi> by the pleaſant muſick of their voice, and allure them to pay their homage to <hi>Venus.</hi> And therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, <hi>If Partridge-hennes ſtand</hi>

My o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is, that the ſeed of the cocke injected into the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the womb, doth make the whole womb, and alſo all the yolks that come into it, and laſtly, the whole egge, fertile; and that it doth this by its vertue, or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual irradiating ſubſtance; after the ſame manner, as we perceive other creatures become fertile, by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticles, and ſeed: for if any man conſider that incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible tranſmutation, which doth ſeize upon a creature</hi>

               <hi>that is gelded, by which it looſeth its heat, vigour, and fecundity in the whole body; he will eaſily conſent, that what we ſay, may well befall the ſingle womb of a Hen. But that it is moſt true, that the power of rendering all the egges fertile, together with the womb it ſelf, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth wholly from the ſeed of the Cocke, appeareth, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from the practice of women, which having a Hen without a Cock, commit her for a day or two to a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Cock: and from this ſmall commerce, all the eggs are endowed with fertility, for all that year. And this is alſo confirmed by</hi> Ariſtotle, <hi>who is of opinion, that</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>de Gen. an. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note>

               <hi>the ſeed, ſhould by any means exhale or evaporate, but that it may remaine long in the womb, and ſo be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to the whole; nature hath concluded, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured it up as it were in a purſe, in the cavity neer the fundament, which is annexed to the womb, to which there is onely an entrance, but no retreat, ſo that the ſeed being there long detained, its vertue may be the better preſerved, and communicated to the whole womb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I did doubt the verity of the foreſaid expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, and that the rather, becauſe I perceived the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> words were <hi>falſly</hi> recited; for, hee doth not ſay, that, <hi>Birds, when they once have had the advantage of coition, almoſt all the egges they lay are fertile, but, they lay almoſt all their egges:</hi> where the word <hi>Fertile</hi> is ſuperadded by <hi>Fabricius:</hi> for it is one thing, to ſay, <hi>that Birds are with egge after coition;</hi> and another thing, to ſay, <hi>that thoſe egges are made fertile by coition.</hi> And this is more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> precedent words, where he ſaith, <hi>In Birds, not ſo much as thoſe very egges which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by coition, can for the moſt part gain their juſt</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:56144:39"/>
               <hi>growth, unleſs that coition be continued. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe, that as in women by coition with the male, the menſtruous excrement is drawn forth (for the womb being warmed draweth the moyſture, and the pores are opened) ſo it falls out in birds, whileſt the menſtruous excrement cometh by litle and litle, which cannot get out, becauſe it is but litle, and is contained above about the diaphragma, but ſlideth down into the womb it ſelf. For with this the egge is nouriſhed, as the</hi> foetus <hi>of viviparous creatures is nouriſhed with that which comes in at the Navel. For after birds have once been at tread, they ſtill perſiſt to have almoſt all their eggs, but yet ſmall ones, and imperfect;</hi> and therefore <hi>barren:</hi> for the <hi>perfection</hi> of an <hi>egge,</hi> is its <hi>fecundity.</hi> If therefore without continued <hi>coi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> not ſo much as thoſe very <hi>eggs</hi> which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by that <hi>coition,</hi> do attain their <hi>Growth,</hi> or (as <hi>Fabricius</hi> interpreteth it) their <hi>Perfection;</hi> much leſs can thoſe <hi>egges</hi> be <hi>fertile,</hi> which the <hi>Birds</hi> perſiſt to lay, without <hi>coition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let no man think that theſe words (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>the womb being warmed draweth, and the pores are opened)</hi> do any way conclude, that the <hi>womb</hi> can draw the <hi>ſeed</hi> of the <hi>Cocke</hi> into its <hi>cavity;</hi> for we muſt take notice, that the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> doth not ſay, <hi>that the womb draweth the ſeed from without, but, that in women, the menſtruous blood is drawn out of their own bodies, the veines and paſſages being opened by the heat cauſed by coition;</hi> and ſo likewiſe in <hi>Birds,</hi> that the <hi>blood</hi> is drawn to the womb, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing warmed by repeated <hi>coition,</hi> and that the eggs do thence encreaſe; as the <hi>foetus</hi> of <hi>viviparous</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do by the <hi>Navel.</hi> But what he adjoineth concerning that <hi>cavity</hi> or <hi>purſe,</hi> in which he fancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the <hi>ſeed</hi> is entertained, even for a <hi>whole year</hi> together, is confuted by us formerly; where
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56144:40"/>
we affirm, that no ſeed at all is contained in it and that both henns and cocks indifferently have that <hi>cavity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, though I eaſily believe (if by <hi>ferti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> we underſtand an <hi>encreaſe</hi> of more and fairer <hi>eggs)</hi> that poor womens henns (whoſe <hi>poultry</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably wanteth good <hi>feeding)</hi> will lay leſſer and fewer egges, except they have reſort to a <hi>cock</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> namely, <hi>If they once mixe with a cocke, then they continue to have fairer, better, and more egges, for the whole enſuing year;</hi> to which end alſo, plenty and wholeſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>feeding</hi> do very much conduce) yet that <hi>hennes,</hi> by ſome few acts of <hi>coition</hi> with a <hi>cock</hi> ſhould lay all <hi>fertile egges</hi> for a <hi>whole year</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that, I ſay, ſeemeth to me improbable.

            </p>
            <p>So likewiſe ſome <hi>females</hi> are ſo prone to <hi>Venery,</hi> that they will chaſtiſe their <hi>males</hi> with their bite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; (as if they meant to whiſper and adviſe them of <hi>conjugal</hi> delights) ſometimes getting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt themſelves, endeavouring by theſe and other arts to entice them to their recreation: and in this rank are <hi>pigeons,</hi> and <hi>ſparrows.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore it ſeems not ſo likely, that a few <hi>coitions</hi> celebrated in the <hi>beginning</hi> of the yeare, ſhould ſtore up <hi>fecundity</hi> enough, to endow all the <hi>egges</hi> for a <hi>twelve-moneth</hi> following.</p>
            <p>And yet once (that <hi>Fabricius</hi> may have ſome patronage) in the Spring time (attempting ſome diſcovery of the <hi>time</hi> wherein <hi>coition</hi> is moſt <hi>ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> and the <hi>neceſſity</hi> thereof) I did ſeparate two <hi>hennes</hi> from the <hi>cocke</hi> for <hi>foure dayes</hi> ſpace, which in that time laid three <hi>egges</hi> a piece, which were as <hi>prolifical</hi> as the reſt.

            <p>I ſhall tell you likewiſe, what I farther obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at that time; when I reſtored the two <hi>hennes</hi> (which I had formerly divorced) to the <hi>cocke</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, whereof one of them was now big with <hi>egg,</hi> the other had newly <hi>layed;</hi> the <hi>cock</hi> ran inſtantly to the <hi>latter,</hi> and enjoyed her greedily three or four times: about the <hi>former,</hi> he circuited often, and by trailing his <hi>wings</hi> at her feet, ſeemed to <hi>greet</hi> her kindely, and <hi>congratulate</hi> her return; yet preſently retired to the <hi>other,</hi> and repeated his luſt again, and again, committing violence upon her <hi>refuſal;</hi> neglecting in the mean time the <hi>henn</hi> that was with <hi>egge,</hi> uſing no ſolicitation nor requeſt.

            <p>This <hi>Womb,</hi> in a <hi>Hen,</hi> is of <hi>different magnitude</hi> and <hi>fabrick:</hi> For in a <hi>Henne</hi> which is big with <hi>egge,</hi> or hath lately layed, it differeth very much from the <hi>womb</hi> of a <hi>Virgin-henne,</hi> or <hi>Pullet;</hi> for her <hi>womb</hi> is <hi>fleſhy</hi> and <hi>round,</hi> lik an empty purſe; <hi>ſmooth</hi> without, within <hi>rough,</hi> having certain folds and revolutions according to its <hi>longitude:</hi> at firſt ſight, you would conceive it to be a larger kinde of <hi>bladder of Urine,</hi> or a ſecond leſſer <hi>giſard.</hi> But in a teeming <hi>Hen,</hi> and one ripe for the <hi>cocke</hi> (which our houſewives diſtinguiſh by the redneſs of their <hi>creſt,</hi> or <hi>comb)</hi> the <hi>Uterus</hi> is of much better growth, and more <hi>carnous,</hi> having larger folds, and thicker, and of that extent, that it may conveniently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an <hi>egge.</hi> And this womb is extended and paſſeth upward a good way, along the <hi>Spine</hi> of the <hi>back,</hi> and is made up of many <hi>complications</hi> and <hi>cells;</hi> (as the <hi>Collick-gut</hi> is) which ſeveral <hi>cells</hi> are compoſed of the <hi>replications</hi> of the <hi>womb</hi> it ſelfe.

            </p>
            <p>This womb, the <hi>higher</hi> it goeth, the <hi>ſlenderer</hi> and <hi>ſparer</hi> it groweth by degrees, and hath fewer and leſſer <hi>circumvolutions,</hi> till at length as it were diſſolving into very thin <hi>membranes,</hi> it becomes to be the <hi>Infundibulum,</hi> which ariſing up as farre as the <hi>diaphragme,</hi> encompaſſeth all the <hi>Ovary.</hi>

               <hi>the</hi> end. <hi>The beginning,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>degenerating into a ſtender and moſt ſoft membrane, frameth a wide orifice, repreſenting as it were a litle pipe or tunnel. The mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle part</hi> (which I call the <hi>Proceſs</hi> of the <hi>Uterus) is conſtituted of three tranſverſe ſpires or Rundels, and ſerveth to furniſh the yolk of the egge with a white, and extendeth it ſelf to the loweſt and moſt capacious place or part of all;</hi> which he calls the <hi>End</hi> of that <hi>Uterus, wherein</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Chalazae, or ſpecks, and the two membranes and ſhell are formed.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Folds</hi> which in the inſide of the womb are <hi>oblique</hi> and <hi>tranſverſe,</hi> are of a <hi>fleſhy ſubſtance,</hi> and look exceeding <hi>white</hi> and <hi>milkey,</hi> breathing forth a kinde of <hi>ſtiffe moyſture;</hi> ſo that the <hi>inward ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> both of the <hi>Uterus,</hi> and alſo of its <hi>Proceſs,</hi> is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as it were with very <hi>much,</hi> and <hi>thinne whites of egges;</hi> by which meanes the deſcending <hi>yolk</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:56144:45"/>
gaines greater bulk, and cloatheth it ſelf in white by degrees, till it arrive at full perfection.</p>
            <p>You ſhall ſeldom finde the <hi>Uterus</hi> unfurniſhed of <hi>eggs,</hi> but that there are ſome ſtill either ſticking in the revolutions of the <hi>Proceſs</hi> of the womb, or elſe conteined in the <hi>Uterus</hi> or womb it ſelfe. If you blow up this <hi>Proceſs</hi> when it is empty, it will appear like a litle oblique diſtorted <hi>pipe,</hi> riſing up ſharp at the end in manner of a <hi>ſnailes ſhell,</hi> or a <hi>Top.</hi> And the Fabrick of the womb is like that which wee lately obſerved in the <hi>privy</hi> parts; namely, that though there be open way enough to receive the egge in its <hi>deſcent,</hi> yet there is ſcarce any <hi>return</hi> to be obtained <hi>upwards</hi> again, (even for the <hi>air</hi> it ſelf, though backed by <hi>inflation.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Proceſs</hi> of the <hi>Uterus,</hi> together with the ſpires, is ſo diminiſhed in a <hi>Hen paſt laying</hi> (as we have ſaid) and alſo in young <hi>pullets,</hi> that it reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth into moſt thin <hi>membranes,</hi> and is quite abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and leaveth no appearance of it, as neither of the <hi>Ovary,</hi> or <hi>Infundibulum;</hi> only there remains (like the <hi>root</hi> of the <hi>cluſter)</hi> a <hi>glandulous</hi> and <hi>ſpongy</hi> ſubſtance, which taſteth pretty ſweet in a <hi>boyled Hen;</hi> as in <hi>Viviparous</hi> creatures (eſpecially if they be young and tender) the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> and <hi>Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> doe; which therefore the people call the <hi>Sweet-Breads.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Womb,</hi> together with its <hi>Proceſs,</hi> is by the helpe of a <hi>membrane</hi> faſtned to the <hi>back:</hi> which <hi>membrane Fabricius</hi> doth therefore call <hi>Meſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trium; becauſe, the ſecond womb, together with this membranous body, wherein many veines are divarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, may fitly be compared to the Inteſtines, and their Meſentery.</hi> For as the Meſentery keepeth firm the Guts, ſo doth that <hi>Meſometrium</hi> faſten this long <hi>Proceſs</hi> from the <hi>chine,</hi> leſt being diſlocated, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56144:45"/>
it ſhould diſturb and obſtruct the paſſage of the <hi>yolks,</hi> whereas now being free and open, it entertaineth them gently. Through this <hi>Meſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrium,</hi> many veſſels ſtored with blood, are bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched into every replication of the womb. And therefore it beareth much analogy to the <hi>Meſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> both in its <hi>beginning, ſubſtance, fabrick, uſe,</hi> and <hi>office.</hi> There is alſo a <hi>Ligament</hi> (like a <hi>fillet)</hi> extended long-wayes from the <hi>bottom</hi> of the <hi>womb</hi> to the <hi>Infundibulum,</hi> ſuch a one as we may ſee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the <hi>upper region</hi> of the <hi>Colon;</hi> which is as it were a portion or fragment of the outward <hi>coat,</hi> going along and contracted, that the reſt of the <hi>Proceſs</hi> might by its help be wrinckled into <hi>folds</hi> and <hi>replications.</hi> Thus, if you cut off a <hi>gut,</hi> and put in a <hi>thred</hi> into it all along the whole <hi>length</hi> of <hi>one</hi> ſide of it, and then <hi>tye</hi> it hard, the other <hi>oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite</hi> ſide will curle up into <hi>wrinckled complications</hi> and <hi>windings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This then is the Conſtitution of the <hi>womb</hi> of a <hi>Henne</hi> that layeth <hi>egges;</hi> namely, <hi>fleſhy, large, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctile</hi> and <hi>extenſive</hi> into length and breadth, full of <hi>windings, ſpires,</hi> and <hi>convolutions</hi> all along the <hi>ſpine</hi> of the <hi>back</hi> from the <hi>fundament,</hi> upwards, and continuous to the <hi>Infundibulum.</hi>

               <hi>the action of the Teſticles to be the Generation of Seed; becauſe we find chyle in the Stomack, and Seed in the Teſticles: So we confidently affirm the Action of the Birds womb, to be the Generation of egges, becauſe there we finde the eggs. But this is not the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Function of the womb, but the Augmentation of the egge alſo, which ſucceedeth immediately after the Generation, till the egge be perfected, and purchaſe a juſt enlargement, is implyed. For the Henne doth not naturally lay her egge, before it be compleat, and have attained a convenient magnitude. The Action therefore of the</hi> Uterus <hi>is both the Generation, and Augmentation of the egge: Now Augmentation ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth Nutrition, and includeth it. But ſince all Generation proceedeth from two Principles; namely, the Efficient, and the Subject Matter: The Efficient in the procreation of egges is nothing elſe, but the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, or propoſed organs, namely, the twofold</hi> Uterus: <hi>and the Subject Matter, is nothing but Blood.</hi>

               <note place="margin">pag. 11.</note> 
               <hi>according to the two-fold womb, that is the ſuperin, and inferior: and alſo, according to the two-fold ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, whereof the egge is compounded, that is, the Yolk and the White; the Yolk is increaſed by a true Augmentation; namely, by blood; which is conveyed to it by the Veins, whileſt it is yet adjoyned to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellary. But the White is increaſed, and groweth to the yolk, after another faſhion: For it receiveth not nouriſhment by the Veins, nor by a true kind of Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, as the Yolk doth but by Juxtapoſition, adhering to the Yolk, while it paſſeth through the Second Ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in my Opinion, the <hi>Egge</hi> is augmented af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner (whereſoever it be) as the yolk is augmented in the cluſter, <hi>viz.</hi> from an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal concocting principle, with this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56144:47"/>
onely, that while it is in the cluſter, its ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is conveighed to it by the <hi>veſſels,</hi> but in the <hi>womb</hi> it findeth it ready for it to imbibe. For in all Nutrition and Accretion, a Juxtapoſition of the parts is equally neceſſary, and alſo a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction and Diſtribution of the applied <hi>nutriment;</hi> nor can the one be thought to be leſſe a True Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition then the other: for both of them are made by a new <hi>acceſſion, appoſition, agglutination,</hi> and <hi>tranſmutation</hi> of the <hi>Aliment.</hi> Nor can <hi>Beanes</hi> or <hi>Peaſe,</hi> which attract moiſture from the Earth (which they ſuck in like ſpunges) be ſaid to be leſſe truly nouriſhed, then if they did draw in that moiſture through the <hi>Orifice</hi> of <hi>Veins:</hi> And <hi>Trees</hi> alſo drinking <hi>Dewes</hi> and <hi>Showres</hi> in at their <hi>Barks,</hi> are as truly nouriſhed, as they are by their <hi>Roots.</hi> But concerning the manner of this Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we have ſpoken more largely in another place. At preſent, it remaines that we encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another <hi>difficulty;</hi> that is, whether the <hi>Yolke,</hi> while it acquireth a <hi>White,</hi> doth not make ſome ſeparation, and choice in it: and ſo, while it is about augmenting, whether ſome more earthy part be not diſmiſſed into the <hi>Yolk</hi> or middle of the egge, (as into the Center, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> would have it) and the <hi>lighter,</hi> and <hi>thinner</hi> parts be not reſerved in its <hi>ſuperficies</hi> or ſurface: For between the <hi>Yolk</hi> which is yet in the cluſter, and that which is in the midſt of the <hi>eg</hi> when it is perfected, this is the difference in chief, that though the former be yellowiſh in colour and appearance, yet its conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence repreſenteth rather the <hi>VVhite;</hi> and being <hi>ſodden, thickneth</hi> like it, groweth <hi>compact,</hi> and <hi>viſcous,</hi> and may be cut into ſlices. But the <hi>Yolk</hi> that is in the midſt of a perfect <hi>egge,</hi> being boiled,

groweth friable, and of a more earthy conſiſtence, not <hi>thick</hi> and <hi>glutinous</hi> like the <hi>White.</hi>

               <hi>you may ſoon perceive, if you keep Hennes in your yard, and be dexterous and diligent to receive the eggs from them, as they lay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> did for a long time prevaile with me, till I diſcovered the contrary by infallible experience. For I take it as a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured truth, that the <hi>Egee-ſhell</hi> is moſt commonly hard even in the womb itſelf. And I once ſaw an <hi>egge</hi> cut out of a live <hi>Henne,</hi> which had no <hi>ſhell</hi> at all, but yet was througly drenched and begin with a glewey moiſture: and yet the egge never hardned at all, by the congelation, or evaporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the moiſture about the <hi>Skin,</hi> (as <hi>Fabricius</hi> would have it) nor was it any whit altered by the <hi>ambient cold aire,</hi> but continued the tenderneſſe which it had in the <hi>womb.</hi> I have alſo ſeen a <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laied egge,</hi> which had a compleat hard ſhell, over which was a caſe made of a cuticular ſoft <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane,</hi> which <hi>membrane</hi> did never congeal. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over I have ſeen an egge exactly ſurrounded with a <hi>Shell,</hi> ſave only on the very top of the <hi>acute end</hi> of the egg, where remained a ſmal ſoft riſing, ſuch a one as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> perhaps conceived to be the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of the <hi>Navel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>Fabricius</hi> ſeemeth to me to be in an errour; for though I was never ſo good at ſlight of Hand, to ſurpriſe an egge in the very laying, and ſo make diſcovery whether it was ſoft or hard; yet this I confidently pronounce, that the <hi>Shell</hi> is compounded within the <hi>womb,</hi> of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance there at hand for the purpoſe: and that it is framed in the ſame manner as the other parts of the <hi>egge</hi> are, by the <hi>Plaſtick faculty:</hi> and the rather, becauſe I have ſeen an exceeding ſmall <hi>egge, (Fabricius</hi> calleth it <hi>Ovum Centeninum,</hi> and our Women call it the <hi>Cocks egge)</hi> which had
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56144:49"/>
               <hi>Shell</hi> of its own, and yet was contained within an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other egge, greater, and fairer then it, which egge alſo had a Shell too. And this <hi>Egge</hi> I ſhewed <hi>King Charles my moſt gracious Maſter,</hi> in preſence of many others. And that very year, cutting up a large <hi>Limon,</hi> I found another ſmall, but yet a perfect <hi>Limon</hi> in it, which had alſo a yellow <hi>rind:</hi> Which thing is now frequent in <hi>Italy,</hi> as I am informed.</p>
            <p>It is the uſual errour of the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> of theſe times, to ſeek the diverſity of the <hi>cauſes</hi> of <hi>Parts,</hi> out of the diverſity of the <hi>matter,</hi> from whence they ſhould be framed. So <hi>Phyſitians</hi> affirm, that the different parts of the body are faſhioned and nouriſhed by the different <hi>materials</hi> of <hi>Blood,</hi> or <hi>Seed;</hi> namely the <hi>ſofter parts,</hi> as the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> out of a thinner matter; and the <hi>more earthy parts,</hi> as the <hi>Bones,</hi> &amp;c. out of groſſe, and harder. But this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour now too much received, we have confuted in another Place. Nor are they leſſe deceived, who make all things out of <hi>Atomes,</hi> as <hi>Democritus;</hi> or out of the <hi>Elements,</hi> as <hi>Empedocles.</hi> As if (forſooth) <hi>Generation</hi> were nothing in the world, but a meer Separation, or Collection, or Order of things. I do not indeed deny, but that to the Production of one thing out of another, theſe fore-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed things are requiſite: But <hi>Generation</hi> her ſelf is a thing quite diſtinct from them all. (I finde <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in this opinion) and I my ſelf intend to clear it anon; that out of the ſame <hi>White</hi> of the <hi>Egge</hi> (which all men confeſs to be a <hi>ſimilar body,</hi> and without diverſity of <hi>Parts)</hi> all and every the parts of a <hi>Chicken,</hi> whether they be <hi>Bones, Clawes, Feathers, Fleſh,</hi> or what ever elſe, are procreated and fed. Beſides, they that argue thus, aſſigning onely a Material cauſe, deducing the cauſes of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56144:50"/>
Natural things, from a voluntary or caſual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the <hi>Elements,</hi> or from the ſeveral diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition or contriving of <hi>Atomes:</hi> they doe not reach that which is chiefly concerned in the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Nature, and in the Generation, and Nutrition of <hi>Animals:</hi> namely, the <hi>Divine Agent, and God of Nature,</hi> whoſe <hi>operations</hi> are guided with the higheſt artifice, providence, and wiſdome, and doe all tend to ſome certain end, and are all produced, for ſome certain Good.) But theſe men derogate from the honour of the Divine Architect, who hath made the <hi>Shell</hi> of the <hi>Egge</hi> with as much skill, for the <hi>egges</hi> defence, as any other particle; diſpoſing the whole out of the ſame <hi>matter,</hi> and by one and the ſame <hi>formative faculty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now though what I have delivered is very true, (namely, that the <hi>egge</hi> whileſt it is yet in the womb, is guarded with a hard <hi>Shell)</hi> yet I have ſtill prized <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> judgement ſo highly, that I never would recede from his Oracles without premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and therefore I do conceave (which thing alſo my own obſervations do confirm) that ſome acceſſion to the induration of the <hi>egge-ſhell,</hi> doth accrew from the ambient air in its very exit: and that, that ſtiff and ſlimy moiſture, (wherein it is drenched at its being laied) doth preſently after its excluſion harden. For the <hi>Shell,</hi> while it is yet in the <hi>womb,</hi> is much thinner, more tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and of a ſmoother ſuperficies: But after lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is much thicker, leſſe tranſlucid, and of a rough Superficies (as if it were rough caſt with a white powder, which had newly dried to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.)</p>
            <p>And now we are upon this ſubject, give me leave to expatiate a while.</p>

In the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> barren <hi>Iſlands</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> there is ſuch a mighty affluence of all-moſt all ſorts of of <hi>Sea-fowle,</hi> that if I ſhould relate all that I have heard, though from perſons of great integrity, I fear I ſhould be ſuſpected more Fabulous then thoſe ſeveral Authors, who diſcourſe of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> or <hi>Soland-Geeſe,</hi> which they ſtory to be born from the fruit of certain Trees falling into the Sea (which fruit or <hi>Geeſe,</hi> themſelves never ſaw) However I ſhall venture to relate what my owne <hi>Eyes</hi> have ſeen.</p>

But this one thing which reflects neerer upon our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, ſeemeth to me remarkable in chief, and doth give a cleer teſtimony of the exceſſive multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: which is, that this <hi>Iſland</hi> as you approach it, ſhineth with a white glaſing, and the clifts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble mountaines of the pureſt Chalke, though the native complexion of the Stone be obſcure and black. That which thus diſcoloureth the <hi>Iſland,</hi> is a <hi>white cruſt,</hi> which is <hi>friable,</hi> and of the very ſame <hi>Conſiſtence, Complexion,</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> with the <hi>Egge-ſhell;</hi> ſo that all parts of the <hi>Iſland</hi> are plaiſtered over with this <hi>hard tegument,</hi> and crumbling or <hi>friable cruſt</hi> or <hi>ſhale.</hi> The bottome of the <hi>Iſland</hi> which the <hi>Tyde</hi> waſheth every day, retaining ſtill its natural colour, clearly ſheweth that that <hi>fucus,</hi> or <hi>ſophiſticated whiteneſs,</hi> proceeds from the liquid <hi>Excrements</hi> of the <hi>Birds</hi> (which they diſcharge when they diſburden their <hi>Belies)</hi> and by which, as it were with an <hi>Egge-ſhell,</hi> white, hard and friable, the <hi>Walls</hi> are cruſted and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed: And after the ſame manner, doe <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> conſent, that the <hi>Egge-ſhell</hi> is formed. None of theſe <hi>Birds</hi> are Citizens of the place, but

Forreigners all, and reſort thither for convenient Laying, and there they continue ſome weeks as in their <hi>Inne;</hi> till they and their Young-ones be all in condition to fly away together. But that white <hi>Ruff-caſt</hi> is ſo ſolid, firme, and thick, that you would think it were the genuine and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſubſtance of the <hi>ſoile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This liquid, white, and bright <hi>Excrement,</hi> doth glide with the Urine from the <hi>kidnies</hi> of the <hi>Birds</hi> through the <hi>Ureters,</hi> into the common <hi>cavity</hi> or <hi>Jakes,</hi> and there covering over the <hi>excrements</hi> of the <hi>guts,</hi> paſſeth forth together with them, and it is a thicker part of their <hi>Urine,</hi> then that which we call the <hi>Sediment</hi> or <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> in ours. We have ſpoken ſomething of this matter before, and wee have demonſtrated it fuller elſewhere.</p>
            <p>Store of this white <hi>excrement</hi> is there chiefly to be ſeen, where the <hi>Hawkes</hi> defile the <hi>walls</hi> that do neighbour their <hi>pertches</hi> with their ejections, which they be-dawb with a glewy white, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh as it were with a <hi>Ceruſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have found as much of this ſlimey cement in the repoſitory of a dead <hi>Oſtrich,</hi> as would fill ones <hi>hand:</hi> ſo alſo in a <hi>Land-Tortoiſe,</hi> and ſeveral other <hi>Four-footed creatures,</hi> that are <hi>Oviparous,</hi> this white <hi>plaiſtering-ſtuff</hi> doth abound; and being diſloaded, the thinner parts evaporating, it doth ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geale either into a <hi>friable cruſly ſubſtance,</hi> or into a <hi>duſt</hi> or <hi>powder,</hi> reſembling the <hi>egg-ſhell,</hi> pound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a <hi>Morter.</hi>

            <p>Amongſt the ſo many ſeveral <hi>kindes</hi> of <hi>Birds</hi> (which make their conflux to the aforeſaid <hi>Iſland</hi> for <hi>Procreation</hi> ſake) and ſo many ſeveral <hi>ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures</hi> of their <hi>neſts,</hi> wherein they hatch their <hi>young,</hi> there was one <hi>Bird</hi> ſhewed me above all the reſt, which layeth one onely <hi>egge,</hi> fixing it upon the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56144:52"/>
               <hi>ſteep point</hi> of a <hi>ſharp ſtone,</hi> (having neither <hi>neſt,</hi> not any other <hi>materials</hi> to ſupport it) and that ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, and firmly, that the <hi>mother-bird</hi> can leave it there, and return again to it at pleaſure, without any prejudice to the egge at all. But if this egge be once removed from its <hi>ſtation,</hi> no art nor cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the world can faſten it again, but it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly falleth into the <hi>ſea,</hi> as from a <hi>precipite,</hi> without redemption. The reaſon is, becauſe the <hi>place</hi> where it is mounted, is <hi>incruſtated</hi> all over with the <hi>white cement;</hi> and the <hi>egge</hi> being newly layed, wreaketh with a <hi>ſtiff</hi> and <hi>viſcous humidity,</hi> which preſently congealing, it is agglutinated to the ſubjacent <hi>ſtone,</hi> as it were with a kinde of <hi>ſoulder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An example of ſo nimble a <hi>concretion</hi> as this, we may ſee at the <hi>Statuaries,</hi> who out of <hi>calcined Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſter,</hi> or certain <hi>morter</hi> tempered with water, doe make a liquid <hi>cement;</hi> which being artificially applied, will take off the <hi>figure</hi> of the <hi>countenance</hi> of a <hi>dead man,</hi> or the <hi>ſhape</hi> and <hi>reſemblance</hi> of any thing whatſoever, be it never ſo litle; and ſo that growing hard, remaineth for a <hi>Mould.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As therefore in almoſt all <hi>liquors</hi> there is ſome <hi>earthy conſiſtence,</hi> (as in <hi>Wine,</hi> there is the <hi>Tariar;</hi> in <hi>Water, mudde</hi> or <hi>ſand;</hi> in <hi>Lie, ſalt;</hi> which when the greater part of the moiſture is exhaled, doth ſubſide, and congeal at the <hi>bottom)</hi> ſo is there a <hi>white ſediment,</hi> deſcending with the <hi>urine</hi> from the <hi>Birds kidnies</hi> into the common <hi>Jakes,</hi> with which I did conceive the <hi>egge</hi> was there <hi>incruſtated,</hi> and <hi>plaiſtered</hi> over; as the pavements are by <hi>Hawks,</hi> and the <hi>clifts</hi> of the fore-ſaid <hi>Iſland</hi> by the numerous conflux of <hi>Birds</hi> and <hi>Fowle:</hi> And thus <hi>Chamber-pots,</hi> and places where people <hi>urine</hi> much, uſe to be over-caſt with a <hi>yellow cruſt,</hi> from the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56144:52"/>
concreſcence of that ſubſtance, which createth <hi>ſtones</hi> in the <hi>kidnies</hi> and <hi>bladder,</hi> and other <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>Body.</hi> I did, I ſay, conceive (eſpecially being induced thereto by the authority of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Pliny)</hi> that out of this white <hi>hypoſtaſis,</hi> which doth much abound in all <hi>Oviparous</hi> creatures, (whoſe <hi>eggs</hi> are encompaſſed by a hard <hi>ſhell)</hi> the <hi>fabrick</hi> of the <hi>Henns egg-ſhell</hi> was erected, and congealed (upon <hi>excluſion)</hi> by the <hi>cold ambient aire.</hi> And this <hi>opinion</hi> is ſo rooted in me by many other <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> that I can hardly forbear to believe, that ſome part of the <hi>ſhell</hi> at leſt, is produced from thence.</p>
            <p>But (as <hi>Fabricius</hi> rightly adviſeth) <hi>let reaſon be ſilent, where experience warranteth the contrary;</hi> for it is too much the <hi>crime</hi> of the age we live in, to obtrude <hi>opinions</hi> built upon <hi>conjecture,</hi> and ſlender <hi>reaſoning,</hi> as infallible <hi>truths</hi> (without any <hi>teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> at all from <hi>ſenſe.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For I am certainly aſſured from <hi>Experiment,</hi> that the <hi>egge</hi> (at leſt here in <hi>England)</hi> is adorned with its <hi>ſhell,</hi> while it hath its abode in the <hi>Womb,</hi> though <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> affirm the contrary, and <hi>Fabricius</hi> alſo is not very obſtinate in the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. Perchance indeed in hotter countries, where the <hi>hennes</hi> are of a ſtronger conſtitution, the <hi>egges</hi> are commonly layed ſoft, and without <hi>ſhells,</hi> but that is very rare amongſt us. So when I was at <hi>Venice, Aromatarius,</hi> a famous <hi>Phyſitian,</hi> ſhewed mee a ſmall <hi>leaf</hi> formed between the two <hi>ſhales</hi> of a <hi>Peaſe cod,</hi> though with us in the like caſe there is onely a ſmall <hi>knob</hi> of the future <hi>pulſe</hi> to be ſeen.

            <p>For, according to <hi>Ariſtotle, the egge which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by Coition, paſſeth from its own kinde into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,</hi>

But if the White be already obtained, it cannot be, that either barren eggs ſhould be altered into fruitfull; or that thoſe egges which are already conceived by Coition, ſhould paſs into the kinde of that cock who was laſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained.

               <hi>is that which taketh place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To theſe <hi>differences</hi> may be perhaps added, that, whereby ſome <hi>Eggs</hi> are <hi>ſtrong, veget,</hi> and (if wee may ſo ſay) <hi>couragious;</hi> for as there is a <hi>ſoule</hi> in Eggs, ſo have they likewiſe a competent vertue. For as in other ſorts of <hi>Animals,</hi> ſome <hi>Females</hi> are ſo libidinous and full of <hi>venery,</hi> that they take like <hi>Tinder,</hi> from one ſingle act of <hi>Coition</hi> (be it never ſo <hi>feeble,</hi> and the <hi>male</hi> never ſo <hi>impotent)</hi> and conceive forthwith, and bring diverſe <hi>foetuſes</hi> by that one <hi>act:</hi> others again are ſo <hi>dull</hi> and <hi>ſluggiſh,</hi> that unleſs they be provided with a more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>male,</hi> and him alſo highly <hi>inflamed</hi> (and the <hi>coition</hi> likewiſe <hi>repeated</hi> and <hi>continued)</hi> they will remain unſucceſsfull.

            <p>On the <hi>ſecond day of Incubation,</hi> or <hi>firſt</hi> of <hi>Inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> the fore-ſaid <hi>Spot</hi> is dilated to the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of a <hi>Peaſe,</hi> or <hi>Lentil,</hi> and is divided into <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> (as if they were drawn by a pair of Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) which have a very ſmall white <hi>Point</hi> for their <hi>Center.</hi> It is very probable, that <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> alſo did obſerve this <hi>Macula,</hi> or <hi>Spot;</hi> for he ſaith, <hi>In the midſt of the yolk there appeared ſome kinde of whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh thing.</hi> So did <hi>Coiterus,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>The ſecond day, there remained in the middle of the yolke a whiter part.</hi> And <hi>Pariſanus</hi> alſo, who ſaith, <hi>The ſecond day, I ſaw a white ſubſtance about the bigneſs of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different faire Lentile, and of that figure: and this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is the Cocks</hi> ſemen, <hi>enwrapped in a white and moſt ſlender coat, lying under the two common membranes of the egge, but above the proper contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing coat of the yolke.</hi> And yet I conceive, that no man hitherto hath acknowledged, that this <hi>Cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricula</hi> was to be found in every <hi>egge,</hi> nor that it was the <hi>firſt Principle</hi> of the <hi>Egge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the meane while the <hi>Chalazae</hi> or ſeed-pearls, do decline on each ſide from the two ends of the egge, towards the ſides: and this proceedeth from the ſhifted ſcituation of the <hi>White</hi> and <hi>Yolk.</hi> So that one of the <hi>Chalazae</hi> deſcendeth ſomething from the <hi>obtuſe angle,</hi> and the other aſcendeth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably, from the <hi>Acute;</hi> as in an <hi>Oblique Sphere,</hi> by how much one <hi>Pole</hi> is elevated above the <hi>Horizon,</hi> by ſo much is the other depreſſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:56144:66"/>
And now the Yolk (eſpecially about that part where the <hi>Cicatricula</hi> reſideth) doth begin to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve and melt a litle, and the proper coat thereof (which in ſtaler egges is remiſs, ſlack, and wrinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled) groweth ſmooth and full; the Yolk it ſelf alſo ſeemeth to have regained the ſame colour, conſiſtence, and inoffenſive taſte, which it former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had, when the <hi>egge</hi> was new.</p>
            <p>And this is the firſt dayes Progreſs of the <hi>Egge,</hi> towards a Chicken, and the firſt platform of its approach. But <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> addeth, <hi>that there is as yet no alteration at all in the White;</hi> wherein hee ſaith right. But where he affirmeth, that <hi>the</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men <hi>of the Cock is perceived in the Yolk,</hi> he is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently in the wrong. His Argument by which he would maintain the <hi>Chalazae</hi> to be <hi>Semen Galli,</hi> is exceeding ſlender, and that is, <hi>becauſe egges which are deſtitute of theſe</hi> Chalazae, <hi>are not fruitfull.</hi> Hee is much in the right; for indeed they are not <hi>Eggs</hi> without them. For in all <hi>eggs,</hi> be they <hi>fertile,</hi> or <hi>not fertile,</hi> theſe <hi>Chalazae</hi> are inſeparable In-mates. But perhaps the Good-wives deceived him (which call theſe <hi>Chalazae, Galladura,</hi> in <hi>Italian)</hi> and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed him into the common Hereſie. Nor is <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronymus Fabricius</hi> leſs guilty of Imprudence, who offereth to our view the formation of the <hi>Pullus,</hi> graven in ſeveral <hi>Tables;</hi> contending, that it is bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyed, and conſtituted out of theſe <hi>Chalazae;</hi> not ſo much as taking notice, that the <hi>Chalazae</hi> are all this while both of them entire, and unaltered (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving onely removed their ſtations) and that the <hi>Exordium</hi> of the Chicken is to be ſought a good diſtance from the <hi>Chalazae.</hi>

            <p>WHen two dayes are now paſſed, the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>circles</hi> of the <hi>Cicatricula</hi> are more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and conſpicuous, being of the breadth of the <hi>Ring-finger,</hi> and ſometimes of the <hi>Middle;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the whole <hi>Macula</hi> or <hi>Spot</hi> is divided into two (and ſometimes into three) <hi>Regions,</hi> and thoſe oftentimes inammelled, and obſcurely ſhadowed with ſeveral colours; fully repreſenting the figure of an Eye, and that not only by reaſon of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuberance, like that in the <hi>Tunica Cornea,</hi> or horny <hi>membrane,</hi> or <hi>coat</hi> of the <hi>Eye;</hi> but magnitude al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and likewiſe of that moſt tranſparent, moſt lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid humour contained in it: whoſe <hi>Center</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth the <hi>Pupilla,</hi> or <hi>ſight</hi> of the eye; but having a white point fixed in the center, it reſembleth the eye of ſome ſmall <hi>Bird,</hi> where the middle of the <hi>Pupilla</hi> is blemiſhed and disfigured by ſome ſuffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or <hi>Cataract:</hi> (as they call it) and from this Reſemblance we call it <hi>Oculum Ovi,</hi> the <hi>Eye</hi> of the <hi>Egge.</hi> Between theſe <hi>Circles</hi> is contained a moſt bright refulgent liquor, clearer then any <hi>Cryſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line humour</hi> in the world; which if you look upon againſt the light, the whole <hi>Macula</hi> will now ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appear in the <hi>White</hi> of the <hi>Egge,</hi> then rivited into the <hi>membrane</hi> of the <hi>Yolke</hi> (as formerly it did) and (like ſome part or portion of the White, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and clarified) contained and bounded within a moſt ſlender <hi>coat</hi> belonging to it ſelf. And this is the reaſon why I call this Liquor, <hi>Oculum,</hi> the <hi>Eye,</hi> or <hi>Colliquamentum Candidum,</hi> the white
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56144:67"/>
diſſolved ſubſtance; as if it were ſome portion of the <hi>white</hi> of the <hi>Egge,</hi> melted and liquefied by the heat ſhining in its own <hi>ſphere</hi> apart, (unleſs it be ſcattered and diſtracted by concuſſion) and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth like a more refined, and more concocted, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous part, diſtinguiſhed from the courſer <hi>White</hi> by a peculiar incloſure of its own, and ſeated and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throned in the midſt, between both <hi>Yolk</hi> and <hi>White.</hi> It as much ſurpaſſeth the reſt of the <hi>White</hi> in clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and tranſparence, as the moſt <hi>Cryſtal Spring</hi> excelleth the troubled <hi>Lake.</hi> The <hi>Coat</hi> encircling this humor, is ſo nice and fraile, that (if you be not exceeding circumſpect) it will ſoon be rent, and ſo diſparage the <hi>purity</hi> of this, with the <hi>confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of other <hi>liquors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here my thoughts were a long time ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divided, what I ſhould reſolve concerning this <hi>Candidum colliquamentum;</hi> whether I ſhould name it the <hi>Calidum Innatum,</hi> or <hi>Humidum Radicale,</hi> the <hi>Radical Heat,</hi> or <hi>Moyſture,</hi> or the <hi>prepared matter</hi> from which the future <hi>foetus</hi> was to take its riſe: or the <hi>Aliment</hi> exactly concocted, ſuch as the <hi>Ros</hi> is reputed to be amongſt the <hi>ſecundary humours?</hi> For I was fully ſatisfied (as I ſhall declare hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) that in the midſt of this the firſt <hi>rudiments</hi> of the <hi>Foetus</hi> lay, and that this alſo was its <hi>nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and after it was of ſome growth, the place of its abode.</p>
            <p>Hence it appeareth, that this <hi>Colliquamentum</hi> is ſoon enlarged, (namely in the compaſs of a day) as is evidently deciphered in <hi>Fabricius</hi> his ſecond Figure, eſpecially the inward <hi>Region</hi> of it; which, while it dilateth it ſelf, it obliterateth and quite expungeth the outward. As you may obſerve in the <hi>Eyes</hi> of thoſe creatures whoſe <hi>fight</hi> of the Eye is very large, and therefore they ſee better in the

               <hi>Night</hi> then in the <hi>Day</hi> (of which kinde are <hi>Owles, Cats,</hi> and the like; whoſe <hi>Sight</hi> is moſt dilated in the dark, but more contracted in the <hi>Light:)</hi> for if you transferre ſuch a creature nimbly from the light into the ſhade, you ſhall perceive plainly how the the <hi>ſight</hi> is diſtended, ſo that it will much diminiſh the other <hi>circle,</hi> (which is called the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris)</hi> and almoſt quite over-run it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pariſanus</hi> lighting upon theſe <hi>circles,</hi> was much miſtaken; for he muſtereth up amongſt his <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, a white one, a yellow one, one of the complexion of honey, and another white one beſides; aſſerting the</hi> foetus <hi>to be made of the middle white point</hi> (which doth indeed really appeare in the midſt of thoſe circles) <hi>which he fancieth to be the</hi> Semen Galli. And that he may approve himſelf more cunning and ſubtile yet, <hi>Before</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there appeareth any bluſhing or redneſs in the body of the</hi> Foetus, <hi>there are in it as it were two exceeding ſmall</hi> Bullulae <hi>or Bubbles; neither of which hath any ruddineſs at all at the firſt: and one of theſe</hi> Bullulae <hi>he would obtrude upon us for the Heart, and the other for the Liver.</hi> But the truth is, that no ſuch <hi>Bullula</hi> is to be ſeen at all, before a ſanguine ruddineſs doth appear; Nor doth the <hi>Foetus</hi> look red at all at firſt; Nor do any of thoſe <hi>Bullulae</hi> give us any repreſentation at all of a <hi>Liver,</hi> but both of them expreſs the two <hi>Ventricles</hi> of the <hi>Heart,</hi> and by <hi>leaping</hi> (as ſhall be explained hereafter) do make mutual returns to one another by their <hi>Syſtole</hi> and <hi>Diaſtole.</hi>

            <p>If you are deſirous to make diſcovery of this obſervation toward the declining of the third day, you may if you be extreamly intent, by the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a clear &amp; <hi>great light,</hi> or by the <hi>Sun beams,</hi> or a <hi>Perſpective,</hi> make a ſhift to diſcerne it.

            <p>According to my obſervation the <hi>Blood</hi> ſeems to be before the <hi>Pulſe;</hi> and I therefore believe it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, Upon <hi>Wedneſday</hi> about the <hi>Evening,</hi> I put three <hi>egges</hi> under the <hi>Henne,</hi> and upon <hi>Saturday,</hi> a litle before the ſame time, I found theſe <hi>egges</hi> cold, as being forſaken by the <hi>Henne;</hi> however, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of them, I found the <hi>rudiments</hi> of a <hi>Chicken;</hi> namely the <hi>Purple</hi> and <hi>bloody Line</hi> in the <hi>circle:</hi> but in the <hi>center,</hi> inſtead of the <hi>Punctum ſaliens,</hi> I found the <hi>Punctum album,</hi> which is bloodleſs.

            <p>And this is moſt certain, that nothing at this time appears, beſides the <hi>bloody ſtreaks,</hi> the <hi>Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum ſaliens,</hi> and thoſe Veins which are all derived from one <hi>Trunk</hi> (as that <hi>Trunk</hi> it ſelf from the <hi>Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum ſaliens)</hi> and do afterward conſtitute the <hi>Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilical Veſſels:</hi> which being diſſeminated farre and wide, the <hi>foetus</hi> at length (according to it growth) doth attract ſuſtenance from the <hi>Yolk</hi> and <hi>White.</hi> You may ſee a lively reſemblance of theſe <hi>Veins &amp; their propagations</hi> in the leaves of <hi>Trees,</hi> whoſe <hi>fibres</hi> do all proceed from the <hi>pedunculus</hi> or ſtalk, and are diffuſed from one <hi>Trunk</hi> through the whole capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the <hi>Leaf.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Moreover, expoſe an <hi>egge</hi> too long to the <hi>colder aire,</hi> and the <hi>Punctum ſaliens</hi> beats ſlower, and hath a languiſhing <hi>motion;</hi> but lay your finger warm upon it, or cheriſh it kindely any other way, and it preſently gaineth <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>vigour.</hi> And after this <hi>Punctum</hi> hath declined by degrees, and being full of <hi>blood</hi> hath ceaſed from all <hi>motion,</hi> exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no <hi>ſpecimen</hi> of <hi>life</hi> at all, and was given up for loſt, and dead, upon laying of my finger <hi>warm</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, for the ſpace of only <hi>twenty pulſes,</hi> the poor heart hath awaked, and recovered again, and as it were reſcued from the grave, proceeds to its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>harmony</hi> afreſh.

            <p>
               <hi>Ova Hypenemia,</hi> or <hi>Addle Egges,</hi> do at this time (as in a critical day) begin to alter and diſcover their <hi>genius:</hi> For as fruitful <hi>Egges,</hi> by the innate <hi>plaſtick</hi> vertue do alter and reſolve into a <hi>Colliqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum</hi> (which doth after ſhift into bloud) ſo <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventaneous Eggs,</hi> at the ſame time, begin to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and putrifie.

            <p>
               <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> alſo ſeems to have obſerved it: <hi>The fifth day,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that Punctum which we cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Heart, did no longer appear to move out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, but ſeemed rather to be covered, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed; and the two Meatus Venoſi were ſeen more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, but one larger then the other.</hi> But the Learned <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> is deceived, for this <hi>Tutelar deity</hi> taketh poſſeſſion, and locks himſelf up in moſt reſerved and ſecret receſſes (when the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is almoſt compleatly erected) a long time after. And he likewiſe miſtakes, <hi>where he ſaith, that by the innate vertue of the veins, the remaining portion of the white is turned into a kind of ſtraw-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured ſubſtance.</hi> For that complexion is in the the thicker white, of all egges that are ſtale, and is daily increaſed in them, (namely, according as the <hi>Egge</hi> groweth <hi>Staler,</hi> as is ſaid) and that without any aſſiſtance of <hi>veins,</hi> by reaſon of the thinner ſubſtance exhaling.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Foetus</hi> growing bigger, (as we ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in its place) and the <hi>circles</hi> of the branches of the <hi>veins</hi> being diſſeminated up and down, part of both the <hi>juyces</hi> are diſſolved, not (as <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drovandus</hi> would have it) by an <hi>innate vertue of</hi> the <hi>veins,</hi> but by the heat of the <hi>blood</hi> inhabiting there. For into what part ſoever of the moiſturer
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56144:73"/>
the foreſaid <hi>veins</hi> extend their Territories, there preſently appears a <hi>colliquation</hi> or reſolution in the bordering parts; and therefore the <hi>Yolk</hi> at that time ſeems double, becauſe its ſuperior part (which is joined to the <hi>cavity</hi> above, about the <hi>obtuſe angle)</hi> being more mollified, and diſſolved then the reſt of the <hi>Yolk,</hi> appears like melted <hi>Wax,</hi> compared to the other cold, compacted <hi>part.</hi> And upon that ſcore (as all melted things do) it obtaineth a larger roome. And that <hi>Upper part,</hi> liquefied by the genital warmth is diſterminated from the other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors (and eſpecially from the <hi>White)</hi> by a peculiar moſt thin <hi>coat</hi> of its own.

               <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> therefore enumerates amongſt thoſe things which befall after the <hi>fourth day,</hi> chiefly three; that is to ſay, the <hi>fabrick</hi> of the <hi>body,</hi> the <hi>branchings</hi> of the <hi>veines,</hi> which now ſupply the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Office</hi> of the <hi>Navel:</hi> and the <hi>matter</hi> or <hi>ſubſtance</hi> whence the <hi>Foetus</hi> doth firſt ſpring, and is conſtituted, and nouriſhed.</p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>Fabrick</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> he relates four things, <hi>firſt,</hi> what <hi>magnitude</hi> it is of; <hi>ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> what <hi>complexion; thirdly,</hi> what parts are moſt <hi>conſpicuous,</hi> (namely the <hi>Head,</hi> and <hi>Eyes)</hi> and <hi>laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> what <hi>diſtinction</hi> or <hi>difference</hi> there is between the <hi>Parts.</hi> Truth is, the <hi>Body</hi> is exceeding ſmall, reſembling in form that common worm or Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, out of which the Flie is bred; it is alſo white of <hi>colour,</hi> like that little Worm, which the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56144:75"/>
Flie depoſiteth in putrified fleſh. to be cheriſhed, and bred up; and he elegantly addes, <hi>that it is moſt notorious from its Head and Eyes.</hi> For that which firſt appears, is a <hi>ſimilar</hi> and indiſtinct <hi>Body,</hi> as if it were ſome concrete and congealed ſubſtance of the <hi>colliquamentum</hi> it ſelf (like that <hi>Gelly</hi> which is made of the decoction of <hi>Harts-horn)</hi> being like a tranſparent <hi>cloud,</hi> which were hardly diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, were it not divided as it were into <hi>two</hi> parts; whereof the <hi>one</hi> lies in a heap together; and is much larger then the <hi>other,</hi> being the <hi>Rudimens</hi> of the <hi>Head;</hi> which is firſt diſcerned on the <hi>fifth day:</hi> in which the <hi>Eyes</hi> are anon manifeſtly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed; which at firſt are the biggeſt of all, much puffed up, and prominent, and are diſcriminated both from the reſt of the <hi>Head,</hi> and the whole <hi>Body</hi> beſides, by a certain blackneſs caſt round about them. Any one of <hi>theſe,</hi> is larger then the whole <hi>Head;</hi> as alſo, the <hi>Head</hi> alone exceeds all there of the <hi>Body</hi> in magnitude. This <hi>Whiteneſs</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> endureth a while, as alſo, the tumor of the <hi>Eyes:</hi> (which are filled alſo with a moſt <hi>clear moiſture</hi> or <hi>water</hi> within, but are dark and black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh without, as it is alſo with the <hi>Brain)</hi> that is to ſay, to the <hi>tenth day,</hi> and more: for (ſaith <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle) It is late ere they diminiſh, and contract to their allotted proportion.</hi> Nay, according to my obſervation, the <hi>Eyes</hi> of <hi>Birds</hi> do never reduce themſelves to the Proportion, which is allotted as the ſtandard between the <hi>Eyes,</hi> and the <hi>Head</hi> of a <hi>Viviparous Animal.</hi> For if you lay aſide the <hi>Skin,</hi> which covereth the <hi>Eyes</hi> of a <hi>Henne,</hi> or any other <hi>Bird,</hi> either of them alone will ſoon countervail the whole <hi>bulk</hi> of the <hi>Braine:</hi> In a <hi>Woodcock</hi> and the like, any one of the <hi>Eyes</hi> is bigger then all the <hi>Head</hi> beſides, (bateing onely the <hi>Bill)</hi> but it is

               <hi>In the lower part of the Body</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle) there is no part extant at firſt, which is correſpondent to the Superior:</hi> And ſo indeed it is: The <hi>Body</hi> at firſt were ſcarce diſcernable, were it not for the <hi>Eyes</hi> and the <hi>Head;</hi> ſo that downwards, it is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by any <hi>members</hi> at all, whether <hi>Wings, Feet, Breaſt-bone, Rump,</hi> or any <hi>Viſcus:</hi> nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is it graced with any <hi>Shape</hi> of a <hi>Body:</hi> but as far as I could diſcover, it is onely a <hi>Litle Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> next adjacent to the ſmall <hi>veine,</hi> like the <hi>carina</hi> or <hi>keele</hi> of an imaginable ſmall <hi>Ship</hi> wound up together, and like a Maggot or Worme, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any platform of <hi>Ribbes, Legs,</hi> or <hi>Wings:</hi> to which is faſtned a litle round body, which is the rudiment of the <hi>Head,</hi> which is more diſcernable th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>What I have hitherto ſpoken, cometh to paſſe, from the <hi>fourth day</hi> to the <hi>ſeventh.</hi> But <hi>When, How,</hi> and in <hi>what Order,</hi> all the <hi>Particulars</hi> are framed, I ſhall now explaine.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Next Appearance,</hi> which preſents it ſelfe the <hi>fifth day,</hi> about the <hi>ſhort veine</hi> drawn from the <hi>Angle</hi> (where the <hi>two points leaping</hi> in courſe are ſeated) there appears a <hi>groſſer, and whiter ſubſtance,</hi> like a little <hi>cloud,</hi> (which yet is tranſparent) through which the foreſaid <hi>veine</hi> doth obſcurely, and as through a <hi>cloud,</hi> caſt a glimpſe of it ſelf. I have ſeen the ſame ſometimes, in well grown <hi>eggs,</hi> upon the <hi>fourth day.</hi> But this is the <hi>Rudiment</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> which now every hour groweth more cloſe, and compact, and doth encompaſſe the foreſaid <hi>veine,</hi> and alſo is annexed to it, like a litle <hi>globous body.</hi> That <hi>globous Rudiment</hi> doth much exceed the Keele (as I may call it) of this little Worm, in magnitude: and it is of a <hi>trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular figure,</hi> that is to ſay, (like the ſmall ſprout of a knotted <hi>ſhrubbe)</hi> obſcurely divided into <hi>three pieces:</hi> Whereof one is <hi>Orbicular,</hi> and larger then the other two, and looks black, by reaſon of ſome moſt ſlender <hi>fibres,</hi> which are drawn from
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56144:77"/>
the <hi>Circumference</hi> towards the <hi>Center:</hi> reſembling the platform of the <hi>Septum Ciliare,</hi> and therefore it implyes, that this particle is transformed into the Eye. In the midſts of this, is a very little <hi>Pupilla</hi> or <hi>Eye-Ball,</hi> appearing like a moſt bright <hi>point:</hi> (as we have ſaid) and upon that ground I raiſed my conjecture, that this entire litle round <hi>body,</hi> was deſigned for the <hi>Rudiment</hi> of the <hi>Head:</hi> and that that black <hi>circle</hi> was to be one of the <hi>Eyes,</hi> to which the other ſtandeth oppoſite on the other ſide: for they are ſo ſeated, that you cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne them both at once, becauſe the uppermoſt covereth and hideth the lower.</p>
            <p>This <hi>firſt Rudiment</hi> of the Body, which we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm to grow about the <hi>veine,</hi> (hath obtained an <hi>oblong,</hi> and ſomething an embowed <hi>figure,</hi> (like the Keel of a Ship; it is of a <hi>mucous conſiſtence,</hi> like the <hi>film</hi> or <hi>hoarineſs</hi> which is contracted by moiſt things, when they are pent up in a <hi>cloſe place.</hi> But the <hi>ſmall veine</hi> to which this hoary ſubſtance doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crew, is the deſcending <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> paſſing along the <hi>Spine</hi> of the <hi>Back:</hi> as my ſubſequent obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have cleared. If you diligently mind the order of the pulſation of the two <hi>veſicles,</hi> you ſhall diſcerne the <hi>blood</hi> driven by the <hi>Syſtole</hi> of that which was laſt contracted into the beginning of this veine, and this vein diſtended by it.</p>
            <p>So that there are two manifeſt <hi>Contractions</hi> and <hi>Dilatations</hi> of the <hi>two veſicles</hi> which cauſe a <hi>motion</hi> and <hi>pulſe</hi> in one another: and the preceding <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction</hi> of the one, creates the <hi>Diſtention</hi> of the other: for the <hi>blood</hi> being darted into the <hi>ſecond veſicle,</hi> by the <hi>Contraction</hi> of the <hi>cavity</hi> of the <hi>firſt,</hi> cauſeth an <hi>impletion, diſtention, and pulſation</hi> in it: which by and by contracting it ſelf, diſgorgeth the <hi>blood</hi> (which it now received from the former
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56144:77"/>
               <hi>veſicle)</hi> into the beginning of the foreſaid <hi>veine,</hi> and ſo dilateth that. I call it yet a <hi>vein,</hi> though by its <hi>pulſe</hi> I conceive it to be the <hi>Artery,</hi> called <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orta;</hi> for the <hi>Arteries</hi> are not yet diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>veines</hi> by the thickneſs of their <hi>coats.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having often obſerved theſe things with much caution and circumſpection in ſeveral <hi>eggs,</hi> I ſtood a while in ſuſpenſe, what opinion I ſhould enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of them. As, whether I ſhould conclude this concrete, and annexed <hi>globous body</hi> were made of the <hi>Colliquamentum,</hi> (in which it ſwam) as out of a compacted and coagulated ſubſtance; as <hi>Clouds</hi> are formed out of <hi>vapours</hi> in the <hi>upper Region</hi> of the <hi>Air</hi> (which vapors were never diſcovered to aſcend:) Or elſe out of ſome <hi>Effluvium</hi> or exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>blood</hi> tranſpiring, or ſome Tranſudation, weeping by a kinde of <hi>diapedeſis,</hi> from the <hi>vein.</hi> For the firſt <hi>Rudiments</hi> even of the greateſt things, are exceeding ſmall, and ſo very obſcure, becauſe very litle.</p>
            <p>This, I preſume, I am aſſured of, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta ſalientia,</hi> the <hi>Branchings</hi> of the <hi>veins,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Vena cava</hi> it ſelf are firſt exiſtent, &amp; that afterwards this <hi>corpulency</hi> or <hi>bulke</hi> is joyned to them. And I am alſo moſt certain, that the <hi>Blood</hi> is driven into this <hi>Vein</hi> out of the <hi>Punctum ſaliens,</hi> and that by this <hi>Vein</hi> that <hi>litle bulke</hi> or <hi>body</hi> is fed. For that firſt <hi>hoarineſs</hi> or <hi>Mucus</hi> is firſt of all made by an <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvium</hi> of the <hi>Vein,</hi> (to which it grows) and from it afterward draweth its nouriſhment and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe: As <hi>filme</hi> and <hi>hoarineſs</hi> doth in other moiſt places grow between the <hi>chincks</hi> of <hi>walls,</hi> which lie long unſwept; as <hi>Camphyre</hi> upon <hi>Cedar-planks,</hi> and <hi>Moſs</hi> upon <hi>Stones,</hi> and <hi>Barks</hi> of <hi>Trees;</hi> or laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as a kinde of <hi>downe</hi> is bred upon ſome kinde of <hi>Wormes.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:56144:78"/>
I did alſo doubt at the ſame time, whether this <hi>Rudiment</hi> of the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> had its exiſtence ſo ſoon, as the <hi>coagulation</hi> of the <hi>Colliquamentum,</hi> together with the <hi>Blood,</hi> and <hi>Punctum ſaliens</hi> had theirs, but was then imperciptible by reaſon of its thinneſs, and clearneſs of ſubſtance; till congeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a groſſer <hi>film,</hi> it put on a more ſolid, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted <hi>whiteneſs,</hi> by which it might be diſcerned: while yet the <hi>Blood</hi> which is thicker and ſhining might be well perceived in the <hi>Colliquamentum</hi> which is ſo <hi>diaphanous.</hi> But whileſt I conſider the matter more narrowly, I am fully ſatisfied, that the <hi>Blood</hi> hath a <hi>being,</hi> before <hi>any other part</hi> of the <hi>body</hi> beſides, and is the elder brother to all other parts of the <hi>foetus;</hi> and that from it, both the <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> out of which the <hi>foetus</hi> is conſtituted, as alſo the <hi>aliment</hi> by which it is ſupplied, is deſumed, and is (if any thing be) the firſt <hi>genital particle.</hi> But how I am induced to this perſwaſion, ſhall be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards copiouſly recited, when we diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>primitive fructifying Part,</hi> the <hi>Innate Heat,</hi> and <hi>Radical Moiſture;</hi> and when alſo wee ſhall reſolve what is to be thought concerning the <hi>ſoule,</hi> out of many <hi>Obſervations</hi> conferred to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>About <hi>this time,</hi> almoſt every hour, all things appear larger and clearer, and more diſtinct, and unfolded; and now there comes a nimble <hi>Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in the <hi>Egge,</hi> and many things appear one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the neck of another. The <hi>Cavity</hi> of the <hi>Egge</hi> is now much larger, and layeth the upper part of it all void and empty, as if a fifth part of the <hi>Egge</hi> were vaniſhed.</p>
            <p>The litle <hi>branches</hi> of the <hi>Veins</hi> are farther ſpread out, and grow more numerous in their <hi>diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> not onely into the <hi>Colliquamentum,</hi> (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56144:78"/>
but up and down both into <hi>Yolke</hi> and <hi>White,</hi> &amp; both thoſe <hi>liquors</hi> are chequered over with <hi>fibers.</hi> The upper part of the <hi>Yolke</hi> is much diſſolved and melted, as if it were a diſtinct thing from the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, and that the <hi>yolke</hi> were now become two; the ſuperiour ſhining like <hi>melted wax,</hi> ſwelled, and bright; and the inferiour and earthier, together with the duller part of the <hi>White,</hi> being depreſſed to the <hi>acute angle.</hi> And the proper <hi>coat</hi> of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour part of the <hi>yolke</hi> is now ſo thinne, that the leaſt <hi>concuſſion</hi> breaks it; upon which enſues a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion</hi> of <hi>liquors,</hi> and an utter <hi>fruſtration</hi> of <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now is the <hi>firſt Rudiment</hi> of the <hi>Foetus</hi> to be clearly ſeen (as you may perceive it in <hi>Fabricius</hi> his <hi>fifth</hi> and <hi>ſixth Tables;)</hi> which being put into a <hi>baſon</hi> of clear <hi>water,</hi> will plainly diſcover, what <hi>parts</hi> of the body are already framed, and what are yet wanting and behinde.

Notwithſtanding all this, if you obſerve ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Egges</hi> at a time, you ſhall finde ſome that are forward, and better grown, have all the parts apparent in them; other Truants will preſent them Ieſs diſtinct.

               <hi>all the Chicken is viſible;</hi> and all pellucid, and white, ſave only the <hi>Eyes</hi> and <hi>divarications</hi> of the <hi>Veines.</hi> And the <hi>Head</hi> is bigger then all <hi>the reſt of the body beſides; and the Eyes ſtick faſt in the Head,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtick to the <hi>Head</hi> as <hi>Appendixes, being yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furniſhed of a</hi> Pupilla <hi>or Eye-ball;</hi> (that is, having none yet perfectly formed; and yet it is no hard matter to diſcover the diſtinct <hi>coats</hi> or <hi>membranes) for if then you pluck them out, you ſhall finde them blacke, and bigger then Beanes: from which if you take off the skin, there flows a white, cold humour, very refulgent if you hold it in the light, and beſide that humor, there is nothing</hi> (namely in the whole entire <hi>Head) contained at all.</hi> And this is the ſtate of theſe parts, from the <hi>ſeventh day,</hi> to the <hi>tenth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>At the ſame time</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle) the</hi> Viſcera or <hi>Intrals alſo appear, and all the appurtenances belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Belly and Guts;</hi> namely, the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the Heart, Lungs, and Liver, &amp;c. but all are white, mucilaginous, and waſhy, and have no firm conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence in them. <hi>And the Veines alſo that proceed from the Heart, are applied to the Navel. And from the Navel one Vein paſſeth to the membrane contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the yolke; which is then more liquid and diſſolved, then his natural conſtitution uſes to be. But the other, to the other membrane, which containeth the whole membrane</hi> (namely the <hi>coat</hi> of the <hi>Colliquamentum)</hi> which encompaſſeth the <hi>Foetus,</hi> and the <hi>Yolke,</hi> and the <hi>interjacent humour. For while the Chicken grows by degrees, part of the yolk is above, and part below; but the White being in the midſt, is liquid. And the white is alſo under that lower part of the yolke, as it was under it before.</hi> So farre <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now you may plainly ſee the <hi>Veines</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the <hi>Arteries;</hi> as well thoſe which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> to the <hi>Whites,</hi> as thoſe which paſs to the <hi>yolk.</hi> The
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56144:83"/>
               <hi>yolke</hi> alſo now diſſolves, and yet not all of it, but that which lyes uppermoſt: nor do the <hi>ſpriggs</hi> of the <hi>Veines</hi> run through the <hi>whole yolk,</hi> but through that part onely which we have ſaid to be like <hi>mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wax.</hi> So alſo the <hi>Veines</hi> which tend to the White, have ſome <hi>Arteries</hi> for their companions. And the greater part of the White it ſelfe, is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved alſo into that white moiſture (called the <hi>Colliquamentum)</hi> which ſurrounds the <hi>Chicken</hi> ſwimming in the midſt of it, and lieth between the two <hi>diviſions</hi> of the <hi>yolke;</hi> namely, the <hi>Upper,</hi> and the <hi>Lower:</hi> under which (in the <hi>acute angle</hi> of the Egge) the groſſer and more viſcous part of the White remaineth. The Upper part of the <hi>yolke</hi> appeares now more liquid and reſolved, then the Inferiour doth; for whereſoever the <hi>fibers</hi> of the <hi>Veines diſſeminate</hi> themſelves, the parts grow pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently tumid, and ſofter.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> adds, ſaying, the <hi>White</hi> at the <hi>tenth day</hi> sinketh down, being now grown <hi>leſs, viſcous, thicker,</hi> and <hi>yellowiſh;</hi> namely that part of it which is not transformed into the <hi>Colliquamentum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the greateſt part of the <hi>White</hi> is reſolved into the <hi>Colliquamentum,</hi> and the <hi>Foetus;</hi> that is, all the thinner part of the <hi>Albumen,</hi> and the greater part alſo of the thicker.</p>
            <p>But the Yolk appears now larger, then it was at firſt. By which it is evident, that the Yolk doth not yet ſerve for <hi>nutrition,</hi> but is afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for that office. And as farre as I could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, by the <hi>diſſeminations</hi> and <hi>diſtributions</hi> of the <hi>Veines,</hi> the <hi>Foetus</hi> is at firſt nouriſhed by the <hi>Colliquamentum;</hi> for the <hi>Veines</hi> are firſt <hi>diſtributed</hi> into it alone, and thence into the <hi>membrane</hi> of the thinner <hi>White;</hi> and after that, into the groſſer <hi>White,</hi> and Yolk: ſo that even the groſſer <hi>White</hi>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:56144:84"/>
becomes the nutriment, before the Yolk. For the moſt tender <hi>Foetus,</hi> whileſt it is yet a ſmall <hi>Magot,</hi> is fed with the thinneſt diet of beſt <hi>concoction;</hi> that is, the <hi>Colliquamentum,</hi> and the thinner <hi>White.</hi> But when it grows more hearty, it is received with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment proper for its age and ſtrength.</p>
            <p>In the next words, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> deſcribes the ſcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the <hi>particulars</hi> contained in the <hi>egge. At the upper and lower end of the egge, doth the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane of the egge reſide, not the membrane which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the ſhell, but under it: and in that mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane is contained the white liquor:</hi> (namely the Colliquamentum) <hi>then the Chicken, and the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane containing it, which provides ſuch a ſeparation, that the</hi> Foetus <hi>it ſelfe doth not wallow in the liquor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where I ſuſpect a <hi>fault</hi> in the <hi>Text.</hi> For the thing it ſelf ſpeaks, that it ſhould be rather thus. Then the Chicken encompaſſed in a <hi>Membrane,</hi> is ſeated, or ſwims in that <hi>white liquor;</hi> which <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane</hi> is not that exterior one, which immediately lineth the <hi>ſhell,</hi> but another <hi>Membrane,</hi> lying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that: which when the exterior <hi>White</hi> is ſpent, and the remaining thicker <hi>White</hi> is depreſſed into the <hi>Acute Angle,</hi> of two <hi>Membranes</hi> (namely, that of the thinner <hi>White,</hi> and that which is proper to the <hi>Colliquamentum)</hi> is made one <hi>coat,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to appeare like the <hi>Secundine,</hi> called <hi>Chorion.</hi> Yet <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaies well, <hi>In that Membrane is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the white liquor:</hi> for by that he doth not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the <hi>Albumen,</hi> but the <hi>Colliquamentum</hi> made of that <hi>Albumen,</hi> in which the <hi>Foetus</hi> ſwims; for the remainder of the <hi>Albumen</hi> is now ſunk down into the <hi>Acute Angle.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>As theſe parts grow daily more conſpicuous, ſo the greater portion of the <hi>White</hi> is daily conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but it is not ſo with the <hi>Yolk,</hi> which is hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to almoſt entire, and of the ſame bulk it was the firſt day.</p>
            <p>In the ſubſequent dayes, you may ſee the <hi>five Umbilical veſſels,</hi> whereof one is a very large <hi>veine,</hi> ariſing from the <hi>Hollow veine</hi> above the <hi>Liver, and</hi> ſcattering <hi>branches</hi> into the <hi>White:</hi> the other <hi>two veines</hi> derived from the <hi>Gate-veine</hi> (having both the ſame original) are diſſeminated into the two parts of the <hi>Yolk;</hi> (which we have before deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed) and have two <hi>ſmall Arteries</hi> which ariſe from the <hi>Arteries</hi> of the <hi>loins,</hi> accompanying them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chicken</hi> doth now poſſeſſe a greater roome in the <hi>egge,</hi> then all the other things contained in it: and beginnes to be <hi>down-feathered;</hi> and the larger the <hi>Chicken</hi> growes, the more the <hi>White</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſheth. And it is worth the obſervation, that the <hi>membrane</hi> of the <hi>Colliquamentum,</hi> which were have ſaid is joyned with the outward coate, and with it doth conſtitute the <hi>Secundine,</hi> or <hi>Chorion)</hi> doth now likewiſe containe all the <hi>Yolk,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grown more contract, doth convey the <hi>Yolk</hi>

together with the <hi>Guts</hi> to the <hi>Foetus,</hi> and faſten them to it, and ſhut them up like a purſe, where the ſtrings are drawn together. And though it was ſubtile, and tranſparent before, yet now as it growes more contract, ſo it thickens, and becomes more fleſhy: and at length, like a <hi>Hernia inteſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> in the <hi>ſcrotum</hi> or <hi>Cods</hi> dilated, it covereth the Guts together with the <hi>Yolk,</hi> and ſuſtaineth them all: till at laſt growing narrower by continuall contraction, it conſtitutes the <hi>Abdomen</hi> of the <hi>Chicken.</hi> You may finde the <hi>Yolk</hi> thus diſpoſed between the <hi>Guts,</hi> the <hi>belly</hi> hanging <hi>looſer</hi> about the 1ſt <hi>day:</hi> and yet not ſo faſt rooted, but that the <hi>Guts</hi> (as it happeneth in the <hi>Hernia inteſtinalis)</hi> eaſily driven either backward into the <hi>belly,</hi> or downward into the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> may be moved up and down together with the <hi>Yolk.</hi> I have ſeen the <hi>Yolk</hi> in this manner fall from the <hi>belly</hi> of a <hi>Pigeon,</hi> which in the ſummer time, had too haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly broke looſe from the <hi>ſhell.</hi>

            <p>About this time the <hi>Chicken</hi> hath a huge <hi>belly,</hi> as if it laboured of a <hi>Hernia.</hi> And now the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquamentum</hi> by degrees growes troubled and thicke, being altered, and diminiſhed, (which was before in very great quantity) and the <hi>Chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en</hi> lies brooding upon the <hi>Yolk.</hi> And in thoſe days, before the <hi>Liver</hi> attains a <hi>bloody complexion,</hi> or executes the of office the <hi>ſecond concoction</hi> (as they ſay) the <hi>Gall</hi> (which is ſeparated by the <hi>virtue</hi> of the <hi>Liver,</hi> and is an excrement of that <hi>ſecond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction,</hi> as is <hi>commonly thought)</hi> is now to be ſeen, of a <hi>green colour</hi> between the <hi>Lobes</hi> of the <hi>Liver.</hi> In the <hi>Cavity</hi> of the <hi>Stomack</hi> there is a clear <hi>Liquor,</hi> having the very ſame conſiſtence, colour and taſt, with the <hi>Colliquamentum,</hi> in which the <hi>Foetus</hi> ſwam; which gliding down the <hi>Guts</hi> changeth its colour

            <p>With us ſometimes there are <hi>Twin-Egges,</hi> and the <hi>Chickens</hi> alſo are ſometimes <hi>Twins</hi> too, though very ſeldome.

Now I ſay, not by Accident; becauſe it may come to paſſe that a man may be the cauſe of his own health, in caſe he be a Phyſitian: Yet he is not in health under the ſame Reſpect, as he is a Phyſitian; but it is a men Accident, that the ſame Man ſhould be in Health, and a Phyſitian too.

But ſince all Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is effected by two; namely, the Agent, and the Matter: The Agent in the procreation of Egges is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but the Inſtrument or propoſed Organs, namely the twofold</hi> Uterus. <hi>But the Matter is nothing elſe but Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now we, though we acknowledge the Action of the <hi>Uterus</hi> to be in ſome ſort the <hi>Generation</hi> of the <hi>Egge,</hi> yet we do not agree upon any termes in the world, that the <hi>Egge</hi> is nouriſhed and encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the <hi>Uterus.</hi> And this both for the reaſons before alledged, when we diſcourſed concerning the ſoul of the Egge, which nouriſheth it: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo becauſe it is an improbable thing, that an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Agent</hi> (as the <hi>Womb</hi> is, in regard of the <hi>Egge)</hi> ſhould form, nouriſh, and angment all the interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or parts of the Egge, according to their ſeveral dimenſions: nay according to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <note place="margin">

            <p>What we have lately delivered concerning the ſoul, doth ſeem to evince clearly, that the Egge is neither the Workmanſhip of the <hi>Uterus,</hi> nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled or governed by it: For it is apparent that even a <hi>Subventaneous egge</hi> is furniſhed with a Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Soul, becauſe we diſcover even ſuch an egge alſo to enjoy Vegetation, Nutrition, Augmentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Conſervation, which are infallible ſight of the fore-ſaid Soul. Now theſe faculties can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not iſſue out of the <hi>Mother,</hi> or <hi>Matrix,</hi> becauſe the Egge hath no Coherence, or Union to it; but tumbles and roules in its Cavity free, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned (like a Son who hath obtained his Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) and growes up to perfection, as the Seeds of Plants do in the <hi>Womb</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Vegetative Principle, which can be no leſſe then a <hi>Vegetative Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Much more will it appear, that it hath a Soul, when we conſider, after what manner, and by whoſe impulſion, the Round and Ample <hi>Yolk,</hi> being new looſe from the <hi>Vitellary,</hi> maketh its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent through the <hi>Infundibulum,</hi> (which is a ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Tunnel,</hi> wrought with a nioſt thin <hi>membrane,</hi> which hath no proviſion of <hi>motory fibres)</hi> working out its own way, till through all thoſe ſtreights it arrive at the <hi>Uterus;</hi> where it nouriſheth, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteth, and inveſts it ſelf in the <hi>White.</hi> And yet all this while, there is no <hi>Motory Inſtrument</hi> at all in the <hi>Vitellary,</hi> which ſhould expell it thence, nor in the <hi>Infundibulum,</hi> which ſhould tranſmit

            <p>But of this morefully hearafter, when we ſhall diſcourſe concerning the <hi>Soul</hi> of an <hi>Embryo</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; and of the excellence and divinity of the <hi>Vegetative Soul,</hi> ordering all things after a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful manner: (which providence, art, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine diſcretion, as farre exceeding our capacity,

            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, becauſe the <hi>Papula</hi> continuing in the <hi>Ovary,</hi> receives its fecundity from <hi>coition,</hi> and ſuch a one too, that it by and by paſſeth into the forme of the <hi>Cock</hi> concerned in the <hi>coition;</hi> (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be <hi>Dunghill-Cock,</hi> or <hi>Cock-Pheaſant)</hi> and ſince ſo great a difference befalls the <hi>Papulae,</hi> as there is in the <hi>males</hi> themſelves of different kinde, what ſhall we conclude to be in the <hi>Papulae</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by whoſe virtue they are diſtinguiſhed both from themſelves, and their <hi>female</hi> parent?

            <p>WEe have lately ſaid, that an <hi>Egge,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally a fruitful one, is no <hi>ſpontaneous iſſue;</hi> nor doth proceed from any thing but a <hi>Hen,</hi> nor yet a <hi>fruitfull</hi> one from <hi>her</hi> neither, without her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with a <hi>Cock:</hi> According to that of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle; We are to conclude, that male and female</hi>

               <hi>are the chief principles of Generation: the Male, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath the preeminence in the original of the Motus and Generation, the Female in the original of the Matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now according to our deciſion, <hi>A fertile egge</hi> is truly a <hi>ſperme,</hi> and <hi>genit all ſeed,</hi> Analagous to the <hi>ſeed</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> and the firſt <hi>conception</hi> reſulting from both Parents, and the promiſcuous produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of them both. For as an <hi>Egge</hi> cannot have a being without a <hi>Hen,</hi> ſo it cannot have <hi>fecundity</hi> without a <hi>Cock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It remaines therefore that we enquire, how the <hi>egge</hi> is made by the <hi>hen,</hi> and how it is made <hi>fertile</hi> by the <hi>Cock;</hi> for we ſee that <hi>ſubventaneous egges,</hi> and thoſe animate too, are produced by the <hi>hen:</hi> but yet are not <hi>prolifical</hi> without the <hi>Cock.</hi> And therefore both <hi>Cock</hi> and <hi>Hen</hi> lay their ſtock toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to conſtitute a <hi>fertile egge.</hi> And yet (as I conceive) not in that manner as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> would have it; namely, <hi>that the Male ſhould be Maſter only of the original of the Matus and Generation: and</hi>

            <head>The Benefit of this Diſquiſition con. cerning Fecundity.</head>
            <head>EXERCIT. XXX.</head>
            <p>THe Diſquiſition wherein we examine, What it is in the Egge that renders it <hi>fruitful?</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubtle, and difficult, and of exceeding great uſe: As alſo what is in the <hi>Conception,</hi> what in the <hi>Seed,</hi> and what in the <hi>Hen</hi> that confers <hi>Fecundity</hi> upon them: Likewiſe what in the <hi>Cock</hi> diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him from a <hi>barren cock?</hi> Is it the ſame cauſe, which we call the <hi>Soule</hi> in the <hi>Foetus?</hi> or ſome part of the <hi>Vegetative Soul?</hi> For the knowledge of the Firſt Cauſe conduceth much to the compleat ſcience of Generation: For <hi>Science</hi> ſprings from <hi>Known Cauſes,</hi> eſpecially thoſe that are the <hi>firſt Cauſes.</hi> Nor is this indagation leſſe uſeful to the knowledge of the Nature of the Soul. But when once the verity of this is throughly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, not onely <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> opinion concerning the Cauſes of Generation is refuted, and chaſtiſed; but even thoſe things alſo which Phyſitians have written againſt him, are eaſily diſproved. Our <hi>Quere</hi> therefore is, whether that which affords the Fertility to the Egge, Yolk, <hi>Papula,</hi> or Whelke, Cock, Hen, and to its Womb, be one and the ſame thing, or diverſe? Likewiſe whether it be a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from whence this vertue flowes? For it ſeems to be ſuſceptible of Powers, Faculties, and Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. Or whether it be alſo a Corporeal thing For that ſeems to be mixt it ſelf, which generates a mixt thing; namely a ſimilitude common to both Cock and Hen; ſuch as is that ambiguous Species produced by a <hi>Cock-Pheſant</hi> and a <hi>Dung bil</hi>

               <hi>Hen.</hi> It ſeems alſo to be a Corporeal thing, which ſuffers from without; in ſo much that it doth not onely produce feeble <hi>iſſues,</hi> but deformed alſo, and ſickly ones, and ſuch as are obnoxious to, and do inherit the Virtues, and Vices of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
            <p>We may alſo make a queſtion concerning each particular, whether that which confers the Ferti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, be ingenerated, or comes from without? Namely, whether it be transferred from the Egge to the Chicken; from the Hen to the Egge, and from the Cock to the Hen. For it ſeemes to be a thing <hi>ex Traduce;</hi> namely, which is transferred from the Cock to the Hen; and from Her to the Egge, the Womb, and the Ovary: From the Seed to the Plant, and back again from the Plant to the Seed. For this is common to all things that are perpetuated by Generation; namely, that their firſt riſe ſhould reſult from Seed. Now the Seed, the Conception, and the Egge are all of one and the ſame kinde, and that which renders theſe Fruitful, is in all of them the ſame thing, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a like nature; and that is ſome divine thing, and hath an analogy to the Heavens, to Art, Intellect, and Providence. As is plain by the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful operations, artifice and counſel of thoſe creatures, in whom nothing is conſtituted in vain, raſhly, or by chance, but all for ſome Good, and to ſome End. We ſhall hereafter be more ample, concerning the Univerſal Speculation, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this thing: Having already ſpoken as far as occaſion hath preſented it ſelf to diſcourſe of it by the by, in order to the <hi>Hen-Egge.</hi> Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how many things is that thing in, which brings Fecundity? and how is it in them? whether as an Accident, as either an Affection, a Habit, a Power,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:56144:107"/>
or a Faculty? or as a Forme, and a Subſtance or as a thing Contained in a thing Containing or as a thing reſerved in ſome peculiar part? For it is moſt certain, that the very <hi>Subventaneous egge</hi> is compleat in all parts as far as ſenſe can diſcover, and yet it is Barren: and likewiſe, that the <hi>Uterus,</hi> and alſo the Hen are perfect, and ſo is the Cock; and yet they all were barren, were they deprived of that which conveys their Fecundity to them. All which we ſhall relate, after we have expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, What, and How, the two <hi>Principles,</hi> Male and Female, do confer to the Egge, and to Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and likewiſe in what manner they may both be called the <hi>Efficient Cauſes</hi> and <hi>Parents</hi> of the <hi>egge.</hi>

For that Coagulum is Milke conteining vital Heat, which carrieth parts that are alike, the ſame way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, uniting, and joyning them. Now the Geniture <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>eanes it ſelf juſt ſo towards the Menſtrua, or excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For the nature of the Menſtrua and of Milk is the ſame. Therefore the parts being gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the corpulent humour is diſcarded, and upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>But the matter is much otherwiſe, in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Egge. For the Seed (or Geniture rather) proceeding from the Male in <hi>Coition,</hi> can by no means enter the <hi>Womb.</hi> Nor hath the Hen after Conception, any excrementitious ſubſtance, or purer part of any ſuch ſubſtance, or any Blood at all in the Cavity of the <hi>Womb,</hi> which might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive perfection from the <hi>Geniture</hi> of the Male. Nor are the Parts of the Egge (namely the <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes</hi> and the <hi>Liquors)</hi> procured by any kind of Coagulation; nor is there found any thing like Coagulated Milk, as is clear and evident out of what hath paſſed. And hence it follows, that neither the Conception (out of which the Animal ſprings, as out of Fertile Seed) is after that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> imagined: For the Conception is after the ſame manner in <hi>Viviparous,</hi> as the Egge is produced in <hi>Oviparous</hi> creatures: as himſelfe confeſſes, and ſhall anon appear in ſome of our Obſervations. For it is a certain truth, that the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:56144:108"/>
Egge, be it barren, or fertile, is made and formed by the Hen alone: onely the fertility indeed is derived from the Cock. I poſitively affirme, that the Cock conferres neither Matter nor Form to the Egge; but onely that thing by which the Egge is Fertile, and made fit and capable to produce a Chicken. And this Faculty the Cock imparts by his <hi>Geniture,</hi> diſcharged in <hi>Coition;</hi> not onely to the Egge which is then begun, or already made, but to the <hi>Womb</hi> alſo, and the <hi>Ovary,</hi> and likewiſe to the Hen her ſelf: and that after ſuch a manner, that the egges which are yet to come (of which there is now no particle in being either in the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vary,</hi> or any other part of the <hi>Body)</hi> ſhall have the happineſſe to be fruitful by it.</p>

            <p>But the thing is plain, that this alſo is not the manner, by which the <hi>egge</hi> is produced by the <hi>Cock</hi> and <hi>Henne.</hi> For the <hi>Hen</hi> doth emit no Seed at all in <hi>Coition,</hi> out of which the <hi>egge</hi> may bee framed: nay more then this, there is no part of her Seed to be any where found: for ſhe is quite deſtitute of all parts neceſſary to the <hi>Generation</hi> of <hi>Seed;</hi> namely, of <hi>Teſticles,</hi> and <hi>Spermatical Veſſels.</hi> For though the <hi>Hen</hi> hath an Efficient power toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the <hi>Cock,</hi> (as appears by our former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe) and that power which renders the <hi>egge fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,</hi> be in ſome ſort a <hi>mixt power;</hi> yet this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not from the over-ruling force of the <hi>Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> or from the manner of their <hi>mixture:</hi> for it is very certain (and <hi>Fabricius</hi> confeſſes it) that the <hi>Cocks Seed</hi> enters not into the <hi>Cavity</hi> of the <hi>Womb:</hi> nor is there any particle of the <hi>egge</hi> made in the <hi>Womb</hi> preſently upon <hi>Coition;</hi> though <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally affirms there is, (ſaying, that <hi>ſome part of the Conception doth forthwith inſue)</hi> Nay I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate hereafter, that this commixture of Seeds doth never obtain in any Animal whatſoever; and that preſently after <hi>Coition</hi> (though it ſucceed and

            <p>Now <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> gives this reaſon why it comes to <note place="margin">
                  <hi>De gen. an. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note> paſs that ſome <hi>Eggs</hi> are of <hi>two colours,</hi> and others of <hi>one</hi> only: becauſe, <hi>ſaith He, in hotter Animals thoſe things out of which the rudiments of Generation, and thoſe out of which the Aliment is derived, are always diſtinct and apart: and of them one is white, and the other yellow.</hi> As if the <hi>Chicken</hi> took its life from the <hi>White,</hi> and were onely fed by the <hi>Yolk.</hi> And in the ſame place he ſaith. <hi>That part of it which is hot, doth more reſemble the complexion of the parts that are to be made; but that which is the more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene part, affords onely ſupply to the body, and keeps at greater diſtance from it. And therefore in eggs that have two colours, the Animal aſſumes its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the White. For the Animal rudiment is in the White, and the nouriſhment is derived from the Yolk.</hi> Therefore we ſee his opinion is, that the foreſaid Liquors are diſtinct, and that <hi>eggs</hi> are produced party-coloured.</p>
            <p>And theſe Aſſertions of his, are partly true, and partly falſe. For it is falſe, that the <hi>Chicken</hi> is made out of the <hi>White,</hi> and fed by the <hi>Yolk.</hi> For by our <hi>Hiſtory of the Fabrick of the Chicken,</hi> both from the diſſemination of the <hi>Umbilical Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,</hi> and the <hi>diſtribution</hi> of their <hi>propagations,</hi> which without all queſtion doe ſerve for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the <hi>Aliment,</hi> it is moſt manifeſt that both the conſtituting <hi>matter</hi> and the <hi>Aliment,</hi> are from the firſt original ſupplied both from the <hi>yolk</hi> and <hi>white;</hi> for ſome part of both theſe liquors doth melt and diſſolve. And alſo the <hi>Macula,</hi> by whoſe firſt dilatation the <hi>Colliquamentum</hi> is made, which is alſo ſtiled by us the <hi>Oculus,</hi> or <hi>Eye</hi> of the

            <p>And yet for all this, the diſtinction of the <hi>egg</hi> into the <hi>yolk &amp; white</hi> doth ſeem to be very neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: becauſe thoſe two <hi>Liquors,</hi> as they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt of a diverſe nature, ſo doe they ſerve to a diverſe uſe. And that is the reaſon why they are diſtinct in every <hi>perfect egg;</hi> one of them being the <hi>Aliment</hi> which is next at hand, and the other, that which is farther off: with the one the <hi>foetus</hi> is ſuſtained at its firſt formation, with the other in ſucceeding time. For it is moſt unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable (as <hi>Fabricius</hi> affirmes truly, and we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſhall explain anon) that both the <hi>Yolk</hi> and <hi>White</hi> are the <hi>Aliment</hi> of the chicken, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> the <hi>White</hi> is firſt ſpent. Wherefore I agree with <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> againſt the <hi>Phyſitians,</hi> that the <hi>White</hi> is the moſt ſincere, moſt concocted, and elaborate part of the <hi>Egge:</hi> and therefore as being the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part, it encompaſſeth the whole circumference of the <hi>egge,</hi> which is yet in the <hi>Wombe,</hi> whileſt the <hi>Yolke</hi> as the more terreſtrial part doth reſide in the Center. For the <hi>White</hi> ſeemes to containe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>In that <hi>Phyſitians</hi> affirme, that the <hi>Yolke</hi> is the hotter part of the <hi>egge,</hi> and moſt nouriſhing, I conceive they underſtand it, in relation to us, as it is become our nouriſhment, not as if it doth ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply more congruous aliment to the <hi>chicken</hi> in the <hi>Egge.</hi> And this appeares out of our Hiſtory of the <hi>Fabrick</hi> of the <hi>Chicken:</hi> which doth firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>The two-coloured <hi>egges</hi> therefore are moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as being more diſtinct and wrought up by a more vigorous heat.

            <p>THe <hi>cock</hi> (as we have ſhewed you) is the <hi>Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Efficient</hi> of the <hi>perfect</hi> or <hi>fertile egge,</hi> and the main cauſe of <hi>Generation.</hi> For were it not for the <hi>cock,</hi> a <hi>chicken</hi> could never ſpring from the <hi>Egge;</hi> nor the <hi>Egge</hi> it ſelf have any being in many <hi>Oviparous</hi> creatures. And therefore we muſt make farther ſearch concerning the <hi>Action</hi> and uſe of the <hi>cock,</hi> namely what advantage he brings to the <hi>egge,</hi> and the <hi>chicken,</hi> as well by <hi>Coition,</hi> as other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</p>
            <p>It is evident that the <hi>cock</hi> (though, as I ſuppoſe, he wants a <hi>Yard)</hi> doth emit his <hi>Geniture,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Seed,</hi> as may be collected from his Genital Parts; for the <hi>Teſticles</hi> are furniſhed with it, and there is great abundance of it diſcoverable in the long and ample <hi>Leading Veſſels.</hi> But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it leap out, capering, and frothy by the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the <hi>ſpirits,</hi> and at ſeveral ejections (as in hotter <hi>Viviparous</hi> creatures) I am not yet able to reſolve. But becauſe I can finde no <hi>Veſicles</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the <hi>Geniture,</hi> by which it ſhould be fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, and dart forth, heightned by the <hi>ſpirits</hi> into a <hi>Spuma,</hi> or froth: and alſo finding no <hi>Yard</hi>

through whoſe narrower <hi>channel</hi> it being protru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, it might leap, and reſult, verberating the Interiours of the <hi>Hen,</hi> eſpecially ſeeing <hi>coition</hi> in Cocks ſo ſoon over; I rather believe, that there is onely a light tincture of <hi>ſeminal</hi> humour, ſuch as doth onely moiſten the Orifice of the <hi>Pudenda;</hi> and that the ſeed is ſpeedily diſlodged without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſprightly exilition: ſo that, what other <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals</hi> do ejaculate by ſeveral reverberations at one and the ſame Inition, Birds (which do not long inſiſt upon venereal undertakings) do expedite by many repeated Coitions. For thoſe creatures that dwell long in venereal offices, do make but feldom repetitions: and ſuch, among Birds, are the <hi>Swan,</hi> and the <hi>Oſtrich:</hi> Becauſe the <hi>Cock</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot ſtay long in his performances, he doth execute that at ſeveral returnes, which other creatures do at ſeveral impulſes. And though he neither have <hi>Glans,</hi> nor <hi>Ponis,</hi> yet the extremity of the <hi>deferent Veſſels</hi> growing turgent by <hi>ſpirits</hi> (in Coition) doth extuberate after the manner of a <hi>Glans,</hi> by which he doth compreſs the Orifice of the <hi>Uterus</hi> of the <hi>Henne,</hi> it being bared and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the apertion of the <hi>Fundament;</hi> and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewing it with genital moiſture, he ſtands in no need of a <hi>Yard</hi> for the immiſſion of his Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Now, we have ſhewed you, that the <hi>Cocks Seed</hi> is of ſo great vertue, that it doth render not the <hi>Uterus</hi> onely, but the Egge in the <hi>Uterus,</hi> the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pula</hi> in the <hi>Ovary,</hi> and laſtly the whole <hi>Hen</hi> her ſelf, and all the Rudiments of the <hi>Eggs,</hi> either al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in being, or to be produced hereafter, <hi>fertile</hi> and <hi>Prolifical.</hi>

in a <hi>Prolificall</hi> Conception as after it) as it is in the Generation of the Chicken out of the Egge, and juſt in that manner as <hi>Plants</hi> do ſpring from ſeeds of their own kind. For it doth not appear that the Male is required, to the intent that hee ſhould be as an Agent, Operatour, or Efficient <hi>per ſe,</hi> nor that the Female, is required that ſhe ſhould contribute the matter; but both Male and Female are to be eſteemed in ſome ſort the Operatour, and Parent: and the <hi>foetus</hi> is procreated a mixt ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, and reſemblance, as if it proceeded from both mixt together. Nor is it true which <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> often affirms, and <hi>Phyſitians</hi> take for granted, namely, that preſently after Coition, there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be found of the <hi>foetus,</hi> or conception, (as the <hi>Heart,</hi> or the <hi>Tres Bullae,</hi> or ſome other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple part) or ſomething at leaſt in the cavity of the Womb, as ſome <hi>Coagulum,</hi> or <hi>Spermatical</hi> mixt ſubſtance, or the like. But on the contrary, in caſe the Female prove fertile, and pregnant, it happens that the <hi>eggs,</hi> and <hi>conception</hi> in the moſt, and moſt perfect creatures, is firſt begun long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter coition. And that the Female alſo is <hi>prolifical,</hi> before any thing of the conception be at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Womb, many indications do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire to aſcertain, as ſhall be afterwards diſcovered in the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>Viviparous Animals:</hi> as the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of the Breaſts, and the turgid ſwelling of the Womb, by which and other Symptomes we may perceive an <hi>Alteration</hi> in the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
            <p>But as for the <hi>Hen,</hi> though ſhe have for the moſt part the Rudiments of <hi>eggs</hi> in her before <hi>coition,</hi> which are afterwards by the Tread made <hi>prolificall,</hi> and therefore ſhe then hath ſomething in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenly upon <hi>coition,</hi> or <hi>treading:</hi> yet when it falls

doth not a litle conduce to rouſe and heighten the <hi>males</hi> ſleepy heat, and languiſhing appetite, to quicken and encourage his performance. But of theſe provocations and allurements, ſo farre as they ſerve to promote conception, we ſhall ſpeak more anon. For if you carefully ponder Natures works, you ſhall finde none of them made in vain, but all directed to ſome end, and for ſome good.</p>
            <p>Almoſt all <hi>females</hi> are pleaſed &amp; delighted with the act of <hi>coition,</hi> and rejoyce at their great bellies, but many groan at their delivery.

            <p>But though there are many rudiments of <hi>eggs,</hi> of different magnitude, and degree, in the <hi>Hens O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vary,</hi> inſomuch that ſome are augmented and come to maturity before others, yet they all ſeem to be fructified alike, and receive the prolifical ſtamp together, by the Cocks <hi>coition.</hi>

            <p>And though a good ſpace of time paſs away (namely, thirty dayes or more) before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<hi>-hen</hi> or <hi>Partridge-hen</hi> disburden all the Egges in their <hi>Ovary,</hi> yet when ever the <hi>Hen</hi> ſits upon them, they bring forth all their <hi>chickens</hi> almoſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, at the ſet time (namely, in the compaſs of twenty, or two and twenty daies) and they are all likewiſe no leſs complete, then if they had all ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

Since therefore one thing may be made out of another ſo many wayes, it is apparent, that the Seed is in another, two of theſe wayes. For that which is begotten, is out of it, either as out of its matter, or as its firſt mover. For it is not barely, as this thing is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, as Navigation after the Panathenaea, nor as one contrary out of another; for a contrary is begotten out of the corruption of a contrary, and there muſt needs be ſome ſubject matter, out of which, as out of a firſt</hi>

            <p>IT is therefore granted, that the <hi>Chicken</hi> is made out of a <hi>prolifical Egg,</hi> as out of its <hi>Matter,</hi> and as by its <hi>Efficient;</hi> and that the ſame <hi>Egge</hi> is both the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of the <hi>Chicken.</hi> For as it deduceth its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal from the <hi>Hen,</hi> and is eſteemed the <hi>fruit,</hi> it is the <hi>Matter:</hi> but in as much as it containeth in it, throughout all its ſubſtance, a <hi>plaſtical,</hi> and <hi>proli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical</hi> virtue infuſed by the <hi>Male,</hi> it is called the <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi> of the <hi>Chicken.</hi> So that not onely (as <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricius</hi> would have it) theſe things are inſeparably joyned together in one and the ſame <hi>Egge;</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>Agent,</hi> and the <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> but it is alſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that the ſame place ſhould alſo containe <hi>Aliment,</hi> by which it ſhould be nouriſhed. So that in a <hi>prolifical Egge</hi> theſe four things are to be found together; namely, the <hi>Efficient,</hi> the <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> the <hi>Matter,</hi> and the <hi>Aliment,</hi> as appears plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>Wherefore we affirme, that the <hi>Chicken</hi> is made out of the <hi>prolifical Egge</hi> all the fore-ſaid waies; namely, as out of its <hi>Matter, Efficient,</hi> and <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> and alſo as a <hi>Man</hi> is made out of a <hi>Boy,</hi> and the <hi>Whole</hi> out of a <hi>Part:</hi> and alſo <hi>tanquam ex Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento,</hi> as a thing may be ſaid to be made of its nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment; and likewiſe as a <hi>contrary</hi> is made out of a <hi>contrary.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And when <hi>Blood</hi> is made out of the white <hi>Colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quamentum,</hi> or the <hi>Colliquamentum</hi> out of the <hi>Yolk</hi> or <hi>White,</hi> it is called the <hi>generation</hi> of the one, and the <hi>corruption</hi> of the other: there being an <hi>altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> made from the <hi>contrary</hi> to the <hi>contrary,</hi> the ſame <hi>ſubject matter</hi> remaining ſtill.

            <p>The Chicken alſo is made out of the <hi>Egg, ſicut vir ex puero,</hi> as a <hi>Man</hi> is made out of a <hi>Boy.</hi> For as out of <hi>Plants Seeds</hi> are made, out of <hi>Seeds, Bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes, Sprouts, Stems, Flowers,</hi> and <hi>Fruits:</hi> ſo alſo out of an <hi>Egge,</hi> (which is the <hi>Hens Seed)</hi> is made the <hi>dilatation</hi> of the <hi>Macula,</hi> the <hi>Colliquamentum,</hi> the <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Heart,</hi> as the firſt particle of the <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> (or <hi>fruit.)</hi> And that, <hi>tanquam ex nocte dies,</hi> as the <hi>Night</hi> is made out of the <hi>Day;</hi> the <hi>Sommer</hi> out of the <hi>Spring;</hi> and a <hi>Man</hi> out of a <hi>Boy:</hi> Where this thing, is after that.

And hereupon <hi>Fabricius</hi> for confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">pag. 34.</note> of his opinion, ſaith: <hi>There are three onely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which do conduce to the fabrick of the egg, and the generation of the chicken, the</hi> White, <hi>the</hi> Yolk, <hi>and the</hi> Chalazae: <hi>the</hi> White <hi>and</hi> Yolk <hi>are the</hi> Chickens <hi>ſubſtance; therefore the</hi> Chalazae <hi>onely are the ſubject matter of the chicken.</hi> But that the moſt excellent <hi>Fabricius</hi> is in an error, we have demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated before in our <hi>Hiſtory.</hi> For after the chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken is well nigh compleated, when his <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Eyes</hi> are diſtinctly to be ſeen, the <hi>Chalazae</hi> are ſtill
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:56144:130"/>
found in the <hi>Egg</hi> far remote from the <hi>Chicken,</hi> and ſtill entire, being then depreſſed from the two ends of the <hi>egg</hi> to the ſides, and do execute (as he alſo confeſſes) the office of <hi>Ligaments,</hi> to keep the <hi>Yolk</hi> in its true poſition within the <hi>White.</hi> Nor is that true neither, which <hi>Fabricius</hi> addes to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his perſwaſion; namely, that the <hi>Chalazae</hi> are ſeated directly under the <hi>Obtuſe Angle</hi> of the <hi>Egge.</hi> For after the firſt days <hi>Incubation</hi> the <hi>Liquors</hi> ſhift their ſtations; the Yolk is exalted, and the <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lazae</hi> are depreſſed from both ends, as hath been ſaid.</p>
            <p>He is alſo deceived, when he ſaith that the <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lazae</hi> are parts of the <hi>Egge:</hi> for in truth, the <hi>egge</hi> is conſtituted onely by the Yolk, and the White; but the <hi>chalazae,</hi> as alſo the <hi>membranes,</hi> are onely certain litle <hi>Appendixes</hi> of the <hi>White,</hi> and nothing elſe but meerly the <hi>extremities</hi> of the <hi>membranes</hi> contorted and twiſted, (as filaments or ſtrings are twiſted into a Rope) that ſo they may the better preſerve the <hi>Liquors</hi> in their proper places, by a firmer tye.</p>
            <p>And therefore his Inference is infirme, when he ſaith: <hi>The chalazae are found to be in that part of the egg where the chicken is made, and therefore the chicken is made out of them.</hi> For even according to <hi>Fabricius</hi> himſelf, that can no wayes be: who confeſſes, that the <hi>chalazae</hi> are to be found in the two extremities of the <hi>egg,</hi> and yet denies, that the <hi>chicken</hi> is any where made, but onely in the <hi>Obtuſe end</hi> of it: in which end truly, from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry firſt ſetting out towards the Generation of the Chicken, there is no <hi>chalazae</hi> to be found at all. Nay, if you make tryal in a <hi>New-layd Egge,</hi> you ſhall find that the ſuperiour <hi>chalaza</hi> is not directly ſeated under the <hi>Obtuſe end,</hi> or the <hi>cavity</hi> thereof,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:56144:131"/>
but inclining ſomething to the ſide; nor on that ſide neither, where the <hi>cavity</hi> doth tend, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the contrary ſide. Moreover, it hath been ſhewed before, that the ſcituation of the <hi>Liquors</hi> immediately upon <hi>Incubation</hi> is ſhifted, becauſe the <hi>Oculus,</hi> or <hi>Eye of the egge</hi> being enlarged by the <hi>colliquamentum,</hi> is exalted to the <hi>cavity</hi> in the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſe Angle,</hi> upon which the <hi>liquors</hi> and <hi>chalazae</hi> at each end do remove to the <hi>ſides.</hi> For the <hi>Macu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> or <hi>Speck,</hi> which before <hi>Incubation,</hi> was ſeated in the middeſt between both the extremities of the <hi>egge,</hi> now being inlarged into an <hi>Oculus,</hi> or <hi>Eye,</hi> is adjoyned to the <hi>cavity</hi> in the <hi>Obtuſe end;</hi> and one of the <hi>chalazae</hi> is depoſed from the <hi>Obtuſe Angle,</hi> and the other is exalted (ſo much as the other is depoſed) from the <hi>Acute Angle;</hi> (juſt as the <hi>Poles</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> are ſeated in an <hi>Oblique Hemiſphere)</hi> and at the ſame time, the greateſt part of the White, eſpecially of the groſſer part of it, doth ſinck down to the <hi>Acute Angle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is that true neither where he endeavors to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a probable argument to prove the <hi>chalazae</hi> to be the <hi>Matter</hi> of the <hi>Pullus,</hi> from the likeneſs &amp; ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of their conſiſtence, alleadging, that the <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lazae</hi> 
               <note place="margin">pag. 35.</note> do repreſent the firſt formation of the Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, by their figure and longitude, and have alſo as many twiſts or knots, as there are principle parts in the Chicken.</p>
            <p>Nor is that <hi>corpus Rubrum</hi> (which he alſo took for the <hi>Liver)</hi> or red ſubſtance in the <hi>chalazae,</hi> or any thing neer them, but in the middle of the <hi>col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquamentum candidum;</hi> and it is the rudiment of the <hi>Heart</hi> onely. Nor doth the example of the <hi>Tadpoles</hi> alleadged by him, ſquare to his purpoſe, of <hi>which,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>you can onely diſcern their Head and Taile, that is, their Head and ſpine of the Back,</hi>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:56144:131"/>
               <hi>having neither fore-legs nor hinder-legs.</hi> And he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, <hi>that whoſoever ſeeth a</hi> Chalaza, <hi>and one of theſe conceptions, will think he ſees one and the ſame body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I have made many <hi>diſſections</hi> of theſe <hi>Tad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poles,</hi> and have ſeen a pretty large <hi>Belly</hi> in them, and in that <hi>Belly Guts,</hi> and a <hi>Liver,</hi> and a <hi>Heart</hi> panting; and alſo I have diſcovered their <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Eyes</hi> too. But that which <hi>Fabricius</hi> takes for their <hi>Head,</hi> is their round figure, from which they are called <hi>Gyrini;</hi> becauſe their form or fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure in <hi>gyrum vertitur,</hi> curles into a round. They have alſo a <hi>Taile</hi> by which they ſwim, but legs indeed they want. Yet about the <hi>Solſtice,</hi> they loſe or caſt their <hi>Taile,</hi> having then <hi>hinder-legs,</hi> and <hi>fore-legs</hi> beginning to ſtrut out. Now there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the firſt diviſion of a Chicken into his <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Spine,</hi> that any way reſembles this; which ſhould any way induce us to believe that the Chicken is made out of the <hi>Chalazae,</hi> in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a <hi>Tadpole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To proceed farther in the confutation of this <hi>matter,</hi> the worth of <hi>Fabricius</hi> (a man ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly well skilled in <hi>Anatomy)</hi> forbids: nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is there any great need, ſince the thing is ſo evident in our <hi>Hiſtory.</hi> He at laſt concludes, that this his opinion is wondrous old, and was on foot in <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> dayes. But I rather think the opinion of <hi>Ulyſſes Aldrovandus</hi> to be old, by which it is thought, that <hi>the</hi> Chalazae <hi>are the Cocks Tred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, out of which, and by which the chicken is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But neither of theſe opinions is true: for that the <hi>Grandines,</hi> or <hi>Chalazae</hi> (the Italians call them <hi>Galladura,</hi> and our Country-men the <hi>Treddle)</hi> do either proceed from the Cock, or are his <hi>ſeed,</hi> is a
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:56144:132"/>
vulgar error, and an old Wifes tale, both hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and in our times.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Grandines</hi> (ſaith <hi>Aldrovandus) are the Cocks ſperme, becauſe no fertile Egge is without them.</hi> No nor <hi>infertile</hi> Egge neither; which he or knew not, or did not declare. And this <hi>Fabricius</hi> indeed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth; but while he denyeth the Cocks <hi>ſeed</hi> to enter into the womb, or to be any where found in the <hi>Egge;</hi> yet he ſtill contends, that the <hi>Chalazae,</hi> before any other parts of the <hi>Egg,</hi> are chiefly ſtocked with <hi>fecundity</hi> from the power of the <hi>Males ſeed,</hi> and do contain a <hi>prolifical</hi> virtue; though he could not obſerve that there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference or diſtinction at all between the <hi>Chalazae</hi> of the <hi>barren</hi> &amp; the <hi>fruitful egge.</hi> But ſeeing he hath granted, that the very rudiments of Egges in the <hi>Vitellary</hi> are as well fructified by the Cocks <hi>tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as thoſe Eggs which are encompaſſed with the <hi>white.</hi> I ſuppoſe the occaſion of his ſo able a mans error was this: It was hitherto (as we have often ſaid) the received opinion of all <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and <hi>Phyſitians,</hi> that the <hi>Geniture</hi> of the <hi>Male,</hi> or <hi>Female,</hi> or of both together, was the <hi>ſubject matter</hi> in the <hi>generation</hi> of <hi>Animals:</hi> out of which reſiding in the <hi>Uterus</hi> (after <hi>coition)</hi> the <hi>Animals</hi> are generated (in like manner as <hi>Plants</hi> are made, and ſpring out of the <hi>ſeeds</hi> ſowen in the ground:) nor was <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> much diſtant from this opinion, who would needs have the <hi>menſtruous blood</hi> to be the <hi>womans,</hi> which the Males geniture doth coagulate, and ſo conſtitute the <hi>conception.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the fore-ſaid Error being granted by all, (for an infallible <hi>principle)</hi> it is no great wonder, if afterwards (according to every mans particular conjecture) many falſe opinions do creep in. For
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:56144:132"/>
they are quite beſide their mark, who conceive that after <hi>coition</hi> ſome kinde of ſubſtance or matter doth remain, fit and convenient for the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>foetus,</hi> or firſt <hi>conception;</hi> or that any thing elſe is formed in the <hi>cavity</hi> of the <hi>womb,</hi> which may be of like uſe with the <hi>ſeed</hi> which is ſowen in the bowels of the earth. For it is moſt certain, that in the <hi>Uterus</hi> of a <hi>Hen</hi> (and the ſame thing ſhall be afterwards evidenced of all <hi>females</hi> whatſoever) upon <hi>coition,</hi> nothing is to be diſcovered, more then was there before.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is clear that <hi>Fabricius</hi> is out, when he ſaith, <hi>As a Viviparous animal is incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of a litle quantity of ſeminal matter, but that which</hi> 
               <note place="margin">pag. 35.</note> 
               <hi>ſuſtaineth him afterward is in a great aboundance: ſo alſo the litle</hi> Chalazae <hi>are ſufficient for the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Chicken; but all the other parts conteined in the Egge, ſerve onely for his nouriſhment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which words he declares, that he conceived ſuch a kinde of ſubſtance was at hand in the <hi>Egge,</hi> for conſtituting the model of the <hi>foetus:</hi> leſt hee ſhould ſeem to recede any thing from the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an <hi>Egge,</hi> delivered by <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> namely, <hi>An Egge is that thing, out of part of which an Animal is produced, and the remainder of which becomes the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hiſt. an. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 8. <hi>de gen. an. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note> 
               <hi>nouriſhment for it when it is produced.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this therefore ſeemed an invincible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>Fabricius; Since there are three onely parts in the Egge; namely, the White, the Yolk, and the</hi> Chalazae: <hi>and the two firſt do only adminiſter nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Chicken; it muſt needs be that the</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lazae <hi>only are the matter, out of which the Chicken is conſtituted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus then it fell out, that this able <hi>Anatomiſt</hi> (while he ſought in the <hi>Egge</hi> ſome convenient <hi>matter,</hi> out of which to conſtitute the <hi>Chicken)</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:56144:133"/>
benighted by a vulgar Hereſie, loſt his way. And this inconvenience doth likewiſe befall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men more, who forſaking that light, which the frequent <hi>diſſection</hi> of bodies, and the familiar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with <hi>Natures</hi> ſelfe would help them to, doe yet perſiſt to make diſcoveries out of their owne conjectures, or ſome conceived probable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or the Authority of former Writers; when they themſelves ought to look into the matter, and aſſent to it by their own ſenſe. No wonder therefore that infinite errours, which were deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over by common conſent from the firſt dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Antiquity, are handed down even to our times: and that ſo by that means, men otherwiſe very ingenious, are egregiouſly deluded; becauſe they conceive it plentifull ſatisfaction of minde to them, that they finde it in Books, and have their memories well loaded with ſage ſentences. For they that are thus Philoſophers <hi>extraduce,</hi> by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent and derivation, are juſt as wiſe as their owne Libraries.</p>
            <p>To conclude therefore, there is in an <hi>Egge</hi> (as we have often ſaid) no diſtinct part, or diſpoſed matter, out of which the <hi>foetus</hi> may be formed and faſhioned: but as in the <hi>ſeeds</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> there is a litle point or budding ſhot out; ſo is there in an <hi>Egge,</hi> a ſmall <hi>Cicatrice,</hi> or <hi>Macula,</hi> which being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired with <hi>plaſtical</hi> endowments, enlarges it ſelf into the <hi>Oculus</hi> or <hi>Colliquamentum,</hi> out of which, and in which, the <hi>primordia</hi> of the Chicken (namely the <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Punctum ſaliens)</hi> are ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, nouriſhed, and augmented, till they become a complete Chicken. Nor is <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> definition of an Egge true, where he will have it to be <hi>that, out of part of which the Chicken is made, and nouriſhed by the reſt;</hi> unleſs you underſtand it thus: <hi>An Egg</hi>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:56144:133"/>
               <hi>is that, out of part of which a Chicken is framed, not as out of its Matter, but as</hi> Vir ex Puero, <hi>a Man is made out of a Boy:</hi> or thus; <hi>An Egge is a perfect concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, out of which the Chicken is ſaid partly to be made, and partly to be nouriſhed:</hi> or laſtly thus; <hi>An Egge is that thing, whoſe liquors do ſerve both for the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>

            <p>I have declared that one thing is made out of another (as out of its <hi>Matter)</hi> two ſeveral wayes, and that as well in <hi>artificial,</hi> as <hi>natural</hi> Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but eſpecially in the <hi>Generation</hi> of <hi>Animals.</hi>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:56144:134"/>
The Firſt is, when one thing is made of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing that is pre-exiſtent; and thus a <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead</hi> is made out of <hi>Timber,</hi> and a <hi>Statue</hi> out of a <hi>Rock,</hi> where the whole <hi>Matter</hi> of the future fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick was exiſtent and in being, before it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into the ſubſequent ſhape, or any tittle of the deſign begun. But the other way is, when the <hi>matter</hi> is both made, and receiveth its form at the ſame time. As therefore <hi>Artificial productions</hi> are perfected two ſeveral waies; one, when the <hi>Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi> cuts and divides the <hi>matter</hi> which is provided to his hands, and ſo by paring away the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous parts, doth leave an <hi>Image</hi> remaining be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, as the <hi>Statuary</hi> doth: the other, when the <hi>Potter</hi> formes the like <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>Clay,</hi> by adding more ſtuff, or augmenting, and ſo faſhioning it, ſo that at one and the ſame time, he provides, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares, fits, and applies his <hi>materials:</hi> (and in this way an Image or Figure may be rather ſaid to be <hi>made,</hi> then <hi>faſhioned)</hi> ſo likewiſe in the <hi>Generation</hi> of <hi>Animals;</hi> ſome are formed and transfigured, out of <hi>matter</hi> already concocted and grown; and all the parts are made and diſtinguiſhed together <hi>per metamorphoſin,</hi> by a <hi>metamorphoſis,</hi> ſo that a complete <hi>Animal</hi> is the reſult of that <hi>Generation:</hi> but ſome again, having one part made before an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, are <hi>afterwards</hi> nouriſhed, augmented, and formed out of the ſame <hi>matter;</hi> that is, they have parts, whereof ſome are before, and ſome after o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and at the ſame time, are both for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and grow. Now the Fabrick or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of theſe, proceeds from ſome one part, as from its original, and by the help of that, the other members are produced, and theſe we ſay are made <hi>per Epigeneſin,</hi> by a poſt-generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or after-production; that is to ſay, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,

part after part; and this is more properly called a <hi>Generation,</hi> then the former.</p>
            <p>After the former way doth the <hi>generation</hi> of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects</hi> proceed, as when by a <hi>Metamorphoſis</hi> a <hi>Worm</hi> is made of an <hi>Egge;</hi> or as when out of a putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying matter (the moiſture drying, or the dry part growing moiſt) the <hi>primordia</hi> or rudiments are generated, out of which (as out of a Canker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm now grown to its juſt magnitude, or out of the <hi>worm</hi> called <hi>Aurelia)</hi> by a <hi>Metamorphoſis</hi> ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a <hi>Butter-flie,</hi> or common <hi>Flie</hi> in its juſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude or ſtature, being nothing augmented ſince its firſt birth.

            <p>Bees, Waſpes, Butterflies, and all thoſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that are generated out of a Worm by a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſis,</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>Caſu orta,</hi> creatures bred by chance, and therefore things not preſerving their kind: but a Lyon, or a Cock, are never made by chance, or of their own accord, but have their exiſtence from <hi>Nature,</hi> or a more divine operative faculty; at whoſe hands they rather require, that it produce a <hi>Species</hi> like to themſelves, then ſupply a fit <hi>Matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Generation</hi> by <hi>Metamorphoſis,</hi> creatures ſeem to be faſhioned like things wrought off with a <hi>Mould,</hi> or the <hi>Print</hi> of a <hi>Seale;</hi> where the whole Matter is transformed. But an <hi>Animal</hi> produced by <hi>Epigeneſis,</hi> attracts, prepares, concocts, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the <hi>Matter</hi> at the ſame time, and is at the ſame time formed, and Augmented. In thoſe the <hi>Plaſtical</hi> vertue divides the ſame fimilar <hi>Matter,</hi> and being divided, diſpoſes, and reduces it into members; out of a <hi>ſimilar Matter</hi> making a <hi>diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar;</hi> or out of a <hi>ſimilar ſubject Matter, diſſimilar Organs.</hi> But in theſe, while it produces diverſe parts, and thoſe parts diverſly diſpoſed, one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another; it requires and makes a diverſe <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and that <hi>Matter</hi> diverſly diſpoſed, or quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, ſuch as may be convenient to the production of different parts. For which cauſe we conceive, that the <hi>Perfect Egge</hi> is conſtituted and made up of ſeveral parts.</p>
            <p>It therefore is clear by our <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> that the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi> of the <hi>Chicken</hi> out of the <hi>Egge,</hi> proceeds rather <hi>per Epigeneſin, quam per Metamorphoſin,</hi> by
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:56144:135"/>
an <hi>Epigeneſis,</hi> then by a <hi>Metamorphoſis;</hi> and that all its parts are not conſtituted at once, but ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively, &amp; in <hi>Order;</hi> and that while it is augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it is alſo formed, &amp; while it is formed, it is alſo augmented; as likewiſe that ſome parts are ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added to others, and diſtinguiſhed from others; and that the beginning, increaſe, and perfection of it do proceed by way of growth, till at the laſt the <hi>Foetus</hi> doth reſult. For the forming <hi>Faculty</hi> of the <hi>Chicken,</hi> doth rather acquire, and temper its own <hi>Matter,</hi> then find its <hi>Matter</hi> ready temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and fitted to its hand; and the Chicken ſeems more to be framed, and increaſed by his own ſelf, then by any other. And as all things are increaſed or nouriſhed by the ſame things, out of which they are made; ſo likewiſe the <hi>Chicken</hi> is in all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood made by the ſame thing, (be it the <hi>Soule,</hi> or ſome <hi>faculty</hi> of the <hi>Soul)</hi> by which he is preſerved, and ſuſtained. For the ſame <hi>Efficient</hi> and <hi>Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> is found both in the <hi>egg</hi> &amp; in the <hi>Chicken;</hi> and out of the ſame <hi>Matter</hi> of which it doth conſtitute the firſt particle or rudiments of the Chicken, it nouriſheth, augmenteth, and ſuperaddeth all the other parts. Laſtly, in <hi>Generation</hi> by <hi>Metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> the whole is diſtributed and diſtinguiſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to parts; but by <hi>Epigeneſis</hi> the whole is conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and made of parts, by a certain order and ſucceſſion.</p>
            <p>Wherefore <hi>Fabricius</hi> did erroniouſly ſeek after the <hi>Matter</hi> of the Chicken, (as if it were ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct part of the <hi>egge,)</hi> which went to the imbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying of the Chicken) as though the <hi>Generation</hi> of the Chicken were effected by a <hi>Metamorphoſis,</hi> or transfiguration of ſome collected lump or maſs, and that all parts of the body, at leaſt the <hi>Principal</hi> parts were wrought off at a heat, or (as
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:56144:136"/>
himſelf ſpeaks) did ariſe and were corporated out of the ſame <hi>Matter:</hi> and not by <hi>Epigeneſis,</hi> in which an order is obſerved according to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and worth, and uſe of the <hi>Parts;</hi> where firſt a ſmall foundation is laid, which at the ſame time while it doth increaſe, grows diſtinct, and formed, and ſo attains all its parts by degrees, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their proper order, which are ſuperge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, and born to it.</p>
            <p>For as the litle <hi>top</hi> or <hi>point</hi> which jets forth or protuberateth from the <hi>Acorne,</hi> taking heat and encreaſing, multiplies into a <hi>Root, Wood, Sap, Bark, Shoots, Tendrels, Boughs, Bloſſoms,</hi> and <hi>Fruits,</hi> and at laſt ariſeth into a compleat <hi>Tree:</hi> ſuch is the progreſs of the Chicken in the Egge; the <hi>Cicatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula</hi> or ſmall ſpeck, which is in the foundation of the future Pile, increaſes in <hi>Oculum,</hi> into an <hi>Eye,</hi> and at the ſame inſtant is diſtinguiſhed into a <hi>Colliquamentum,</hi> or diſſolved ſubſtance, in whoſe <hi>Center</hi> is born the <hi>Punctum ſanguineum pulſans,</hi> the <hi>Bloody panting point,</hi> together with the <hi>Ramificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of the <hi>Veins:</hi> from theſe doth by and by reſult the <hi>Nebula,</hi> or litle cloudy <hi>Subſtance,</hi> and firſt concrete <hi>Matter</hi> of the future Body, which alſo as it grows, is divided, and diſtinguiſhed into parts, but not all at once, but ſuch as give place and el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip to one another.</p>
            <p>To conclude therefore, in the <hi>Generation</hi> of thoſe <hi>Animals,</hi> which are produced by <hi>Epigeneſis,</hi> (as the <hi>Chicken</hi> in the <hi>Egge</hi> is) we are not to enquire a particular or diſtinct <hi>matter,</hi> out of which the productions ſhould be imbodyed, different from that out of which they are nouriſhed and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: for it is nouriſhed and encreaſed by the ſame <hi>matter,</hi> whereof it is made, and ſo on the othe hand, the <hi>Pullus</hi> in the <hi>Egge</hi> is conſtituted out of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:56144:136"/>
the ſame <hi>matter,</hi> by which it is ſuſteined and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented. And <hi>potentiâ animal,</hi> an <hi>Animal in poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiâ,</hi> is one and the ſame thing, with <hi>Alibile</hi> and <hi>Augmentativum,</hi> a creature fedde, and augmented in <hi>potentiâ,</hi> (as we ſhall ſhew hereafter) and do dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer onely <hi>ipſo eſſe</hi> formally, (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith) but otherwiſe are the very ſame. For, for as much as this particular thing is, and is converti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble into ſubſtance, <hi>Nutritivum eſt,</hi> it is <hi>Nutritive:</hi> and for as much as it is <hi>quantum,</hi> indued with <hi>quantity,</hi> it is <hi>Augmentativum, Augmentative:</hi> for as much as it is ſubſtituted in the room of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that is loſt, <hi>Nutrimentum appellatur,</hi> it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Nutriment:</hi> for as much as it is added to a ſubſtance already in being, <hi>Incrementum dicitur,</hi> it is called <hi>Growth.</hi> And the ſame thing is <hi>Materia,</hi> the <hi>Matter</hi> in the Generation; <hi>Alimentum,</hi> the <hi>Suſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi> in the <hi>Nutrition,</hi> and <hi>Incrementum,</hi> the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe</hi> in the Augmentation of the Chicken. But that is formally and ſimply ſaid to be generated, whereof no part was exiſtent before, but that to be nouriſhed and grow which was, and had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence or being before. That part of the <hi>Foetus</hi> which is firſt made, is ſaid to be begotten or born: that which is ſubſtituted or ſuperadded to it, is ſaid to be <hi>annate, aggenerate,</hi> or born to it. There is in al things the ſame generation, and tranſmutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the ſame into the ſame: which is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in reſpect of a part, by Nutrition and Augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but in reſpect of the Whole by Generation: elſe it is the very ſame in both. For from whence the firſt exiſtent <hi>matter</hi> proceeds, from thence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo doth Nutriment and Growth accrew unto it.</p>
            <p>And it ſhall alſo appear by that which ſhall be delivered hereafter, that all <hi>Parts</hi> of <hi>Bodies</hi> are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:56144:137"/>
by the ſame <hi>Nutritive</hi> ſubſtance diverſly transformed or altered. For as all <hi>Plants</hi> do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently ſpring, grow, and are ſuſteined from the ſame Common <hi>Nutriment,</hi> diverſly varied and digeſted (whether it be Dew, or the juice and moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of the ground) ſo likewiſe out of the ſame <hi>Liquors</hi> of the <hi>Egge</hi> (namely, the White and Yolk) the whole Chicken, and all its parts are procreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and encreaſed.</p>
            <p>We will then alſo explaine, what <hi>Animals</hi> are begotten by a <hi>Metamorphoſis:</hi> and what kind of pre-exiſtent <hi>matter</hi> that of the <hi>Inſects</hi> is, which ſpring from a Worme, out of which, all the parts are together conſtituted and concorporated, and at laſt a perfect <hi>Animal</hi> born, by Tranſmutation onely: as alſo what <hi>Animals</hi> have any order and degrees in their production, and have their <hi>Parts</hi> produced ſucceſſively: and what kind of creatures they are which are firſt borne <hi>imperfect,</hi> but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſhoot up, and attain to <hi>perfection,</hi> as all thoſe that are produced out of an <hi>Egge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe, as they are together made, and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, growing, and transformed; and are by a propoſed method and order diſtinguiſhed into parts; ſo have they no immediate <hi>pre-exiſtent Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> (ſuch as is uſually deſigned them; namely, the commixture of the <hi>feminine</hi> and <hi>maſculine</hi> ſeed, or the <hi>Menſtruous Blood,</hi> or ſome litle portion of the <hi>egge)</hi> out of which the <hi>foetus</hi> ſhould aſſume his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; but ſo ſoon as ever the <hi>Matter</hi> is made and provided, it grows alſo, and takes ſome ſhape; ſo ſoon as there is a <hi>Nutriment,</hi> there is a creature to be nouriſhed by it.</p>
            <p>And this <hi>Generation</hi> is rather by <hi>Epigeneſis</hi> (as a <hi>Man</hi> is out of a <hi>Boy)</hi> that is, the fabrick and ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the body is out of the <hi>Punctum ſaliens,</hi> as
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:56144:137"/>
out of its foundation: as out of the Keel the Ship is built: and rather as the Potter forms an Image, without any <hi>pre-exiſtent Matter;</hi> then out of any <hi>ſubject matter:</hi> as the Carpenter forms a Bench out of Boards: and the Statuary a Statue of Marble. For out of the ſame <hi>matter</hi> whence the firſt particle of the Chicken, or its leaſt <hi>atome</hi> ariſes, thence alſo doth the whole Chicken proceed: whence the firſt ſmall drop of Blood, thence alſo is the whole ſtream or current of it generated in the <hi>egg:</hi> whatſoever gives a conſiſtence or being to the members or <hi>organical parts</hi> of the body, doth alſo afford the ſame to all the <hi>ſimilar parts</hi> likewiſe; as, to the <hi>Skin,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh, Veins, Membranes, Nerves, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilages,</hi> and <hi>Bones.</hi> For that very part which was ſoft and fleſhy, at firſt, is afterward upon its increaſe, made a <hi>Nerve, Ligament, Tendon,</hi> by the ſame <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liment;</hi> that which was onely a <hi>Membrane,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a <hi>Coat;</hi> and that which was a <hi>Griſtle,</hi> is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards advanced into a <hi>Skin</hi> or <hi>Bone;</hi> and this by the ſame <hi>ſimilar matter</hi> variouſly altered. For a <hi>ſimilar</hi> mixt body (which is commonly concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be framed out of the <hi>Elements)</hi> is not made of the <hi>Elements</hi> firſt ſubſiſting apart by themſelves, and then afterwards compounded, united, and altered, but out of this particular mixt body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing altered, another mixt body is born and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, that is, Of the <hi>Colliquamentum</hi> is the <hi>blood</hi> made, of the <hi>blood</hi> the <hi>bulk</hi> of the <hi>body;</hi> which bulk at firſt doth appear <hi>ſimilar,</hi> and like the <hi>Spermati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Gluten,</hi> or clammy ſubſtance; but from it the parts are delineated by an obſcure indiſcernable diviſion at firſt, but afterwards become organical and diſtinct.</p>
            <p>Thoſe ſimilar parts, I ſay, do not ariſe from the diſſimilar, and heterogeneous <hi>Elements,</hi> united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:56144:138"/>
but are framed and diſcriminated by Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations out of a <hi>ſimilar</hi> ſubſtance, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>diſſimilar.</hi> As if by the Omnipotents com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or fiat, the whole Chicken were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>As thus: let there be a <hi>ſimilar White</hi> lump, and let that lump or maſs be divided into parts, and increaſed; and while it is increaſed, let there be a ſecretion and delineation of the parts; and let this part be harder, thicker, and whiter; and that ſofter, and well coloured; And it was ſo. For thus doth the ſtructure of the Chicken in the Egge proceed daily; out of one and the ſame <hi>matter</hi> are all its <hi>limbs</hi> and <hi>utenſils</hi> made, nouriſhed, and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented. From the <hi>Spine</hi> firſt do the <hi>Ribs</hi> grow out, and the <hi>Bones</hi> are diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> by their moſt white ſlender <hi>Lines:</hi> three <hi>Bullae</hi> are diſcernable in the <hi>Head,</hi> which are all fraught with a Cryſtalline <hi>Water,</hi> being the Rudiments of the <hi>braine, After-braine,</hi> and (as by a ſprinckled black ſtreak is implyed) of one of the <hi>Eyes:</hi> The ſubſtance which at firſt reſembleth <hi>coagulated milk,</hi> becomes at laſt <hi>griſtly, ſpinous,</hi> and <hi>bony:</hi> and that which at firſt was <hi>white,</hi> and <hi>gelly-iſh:</hi> paſſeth at length into a <hi>bluſhing fleſh,</hi> and <hi>Parenchyma.</hi> That which was formerly moſt tranſparent and pure <hi>Water,</hi> is transformed anon into the <hi>braine, After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braine,</hi> and <hi>eyes.</hi> For there is a far greater, and diviner myſtery in Generation, then a <hi>bare</hi> aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, altering, and compounding of <hi>Parts:</hi> for the <hi>Whole</hi> is made and diſcovered before its <hi>parts;</hi> the <hi>Mixt body</hi> before the <hi>Elements.</hi> But of this more hereafter; when alſo its <hi>Cauſes,</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> come to be aſſigned.</p>

            <p>ALl men generally confeſs the <hi>Male</hi> to be the <hi>primary efficient cauſe</hi> in <hi>Generation;</hi> as in whom the <hi>Species</hi> or <hi>Form</hi> reſides: And they far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affirm, that his <hi>Geniture</hi> being emitted in <hi>coi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> doth cauſe both the being, and fertility of the Egge. But how the <hi>ſeed</hi> of the <hi>Cock</hi> doth produce the <hi>chicken</hi> out of the Egge, neither the <hi>Antient</hi> nor <hi>Modern Philoſophers</hi> and <hi>Phyſitians</hi> have ſufficiently explained, nor yet ſolved the queſtion propoſed by <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> Nay <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf hath not done it.

               <hi>Principle of Mutation; but the Female contributes the matter.</hi> And a while after: <hi>Every Male doth not emit ſeed, nor is it any part of the</hi> Foetus, <hi>in thoſe that do emit it: As nothing which paſſeth from the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter</hi>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:56144:141"/>
               <hi>contributes to the matter of the Wood; nor is there any part of the Carpenters art in that which is made, but the form and</hi> ſpecies <hi>doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt in the matter</hi> per motum ab illo, <hi>by the motion or mutation which proceeds from him. Now the ſoule in which the form and knowledge is, moves the hands, or other members, by the motion of a certain quality; which motion is either diverſe, in ſuch as make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe thing, or the ſame in ſuch as make the ſame. But the hands and inſtruments move the matter. So the Nature of the Male which emitteth ſeed, imployes that ſeed, as an Inſtrument, and having motion actually in it, as in the productions of Art the Inſtruments are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; for in them, in ſome ſort, the motion of Art is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which words he ſeems to imply, that <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> is made by the motion of a certain <hi>Quality.</hi> As in <hi>Art,</hi> though the firſt cauſe (namely <hi>ratio o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peris,</hi> the reaſon or ground of the work) be in the ſoul of the <hi>Artiſt;</hi> yet afterward the work is effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the motion of the <hi>hands,</hi> or other <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> and though the firſt cauſe be removed (as <hi>in automatis,</hi> things that ſeem to move of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) yet is it in ſome ſort ſaid to move that, which at preſent it doth not touch, but hath touched formerly, ſo long as the <hi>motion</hi> goes on in the <hi>Inſtruments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the following Book he hath theſe words: <hi>The ſeed of the Male when now it hath acceſs</hi>

               <hi>part</hi> (as the heart) <hi>which now doth augment and diſpoſe it ſelf, as a Son who is free from his Father, and hath taken a houſe of his own. It is neceſſary therefore that there be ſome principle by which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the order of the members may be delineated, and all things diſpoſed, which pertain to the abſolution and complement of the Animal; and from which growth and motion may arrive to the reſt of the parts, and be the author of all the ſimilar and diſſimilar parts, and of their laſt aliment. For that which is now an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, doth increaſe; but the laſt aliment of the Animal is blood, or ſomething proportionable to blood, whoſe veſſels and receptacles are the Veines. Now the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple or original of the veines is the Heart. But the Veines like Roots extend even to the womb, by which the</hi> Foetus <hi>draweth his aliment. The Heart alſo being the beginning of the whole nature, and alſo the containing End, ought to be made firſt, as being a genital part of its own nature; which muſt needs be the firſt, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal of the reſt, and of the whole Animal, and of Senſe: in whoſe heat (becauſe all the parts are in the matter potentially) ſince the principle of motion did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide, that which follows afterwards, is ſtirred up by it, as in thoſe ſelf-moving miracles; and the parts are moved, not ſhifting their places, but altering in ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſ, hardneſſ, heat, and other diſtinctions of ſimilar parts, being now actually made, which were potentially before.</hi>

            <p>This is <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> opinion almoſt word for word, by which he conceives the <hi>foetus</hi> to be made of ſeed by motion; though it do not at preſent continue touching it, but hath touched it former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: a nice opinion, and of a fine thread; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thoſe things which are diſcovered in the order of the <hi>generation</hi> of the parts, not improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For the <hi>heart,</hi> together with the <hi>ramifications</hi>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:56144:142"/>
of the <hi>Veins,</hi> is diſcerned firſt; as being an <hi>animate principle,</hi> in which both <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>motion</hi> reſide; and being alſo like a <hi>free Son,</hi> and a <hi>Genital part,</hi> by which the order of the member is delineated, and all things conducing to the accompliſhment of an <hi>Animal,</hi> are diſpoſed, and having all thoſe attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> beſtowes upon it.</p>
            <p>But it ſeems impoſſible that the <hi>heart</hi> ſhould be made in the <hi>egge</hi> by the <hi>males ſeed;</hi> ſince that <hi>ſeed</hi> is neither in the <hi>egge,</hi> nor doth touch, nor ever did touch it: becauſe it neither enters the <hi>womb</hi> (where the <hi>egge</hi> is made) as <hi>Fabricius</hi> confeſſeth, nor is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way attracted by it; and beſides this, the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers blood</hi> is not in the <hi>egge</hi> neither, nor any other <hi>prepared matter,</hi> out of which the <hi>males ſeed</hi> might form this firſt <hi>genital part,</hi> the author of all the reſt. Nor yet preſently upon <hi>coition</hi> (while the <hi>ſeed</hi> as yet remaines within, and is tangent) doth any particle of the <hi>chicken</hi> exiſt, but many dayes after, upon <hi>Incubation.</hi> And it is likewiſe impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable too, that in <hi>fiſhes,</hi> where the <hi>males geniture</hi> only toucheth the <hi>egge</hi> on the outſide, but doth not enter into it, that the <hi>geniture</hi> ſhould have any more operation and power upon it, (ſince it is meerly an <hi>external Agent)</hi> then the Cocks <hi>ſeed</hi> hath upon the Hennes <hi>egges</hi> which are now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly formed.</p>
            <p>Again, ſince preſently after <hi>coition</hi> there is no track of the <hi>egge</hi> extant, but that it is afterwards generated by the <hi>Henne</hi> by her ſelf, and that <hi>proli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical</hi> too, when now the Cocks <hi>ſeed</hi> is clean gone and vaniſhed; it is unlikely that the <hi>foetus</hi> ſhould be made by that <hi>ſeed</hi> in that <hi>egge,</hi> by one ſingle motion, or by ſucceſſive motions.</p>

            <p>And by the <hi>generation</hi> of the <hi>chicken</hi> it is alſo manifeſt, that whatſoever be the <hi>principium vitae,</hi> the firſt cauſe of life, and vegetation, was firſt of all in the <hi>heart.</hi> Wherefore, if it be the <hi>ſoul</hi> of the <hi>Chicken,</hi> it is plain that it alſo was in the <hi>Punctum ſaliens,</hi> and in the <hi>Blood;</hi> becauſe we diſcover <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> &amp; <hi>ſenſe</hi> there: for it moves and dances like an <hi>Animal;</hi> ſo that if the <hi>ſoule</hi> do exiſt in the <hi>Punctum ſaliens,</hi> building, nouriſhing, and enlarging the reſt of the <hi>body,</hi> (as we have ſhewed in our <hi>Hiſtory)</hi>

            <p>Adde to theſe, if the <hi>egge</hi> have a <hi>prolifical vertue,</hi> and <hi>Vegetative ſoul,</hi> by which it erects a <hi>Pullus;</hi> and do owe them (as it is plain it doth, and all men confeſs it) to the ſeed of the <hi>Cock;</hi> it is then certain that this <hi>Seed</hi> is <hi>Animate:</hi> For ſo <hi>Ariſtotle: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſeed have a ſoul or no; there is the ſame reaſon</hi>

            </p>
            <p>It therefore follows out of what hath been ſaid, that the <hi>Male</hi> is the <hi>Primary Efficient,</hi> in which <hi>Ratio, &amp; forma,</hi> the Reaſon and Form is; which <hi>Efficient</hi> begets a <hi>prolifical ſeed,</hi> or <hi>Geniture</hi> rather, and that <hi>Geniture</hi> endowed with a <hi>Vegetative ſoul,</hi> (with which alſo its other parts are endowed) he doth tranſmit into the <hi>female.</hi> This <hi>Geniture</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tranſmitted, it moveth the <hi>Matter</hi> in the <hi>Hen,</hi> that ſo an <hi>Animate</hi> egge may be produced; by which means the firſt particle of the <hi>Chicken</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated, and afterwards the whole <hi>Chicken.</hi> So that according to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> either the ſame ſoul is conveied by a <hi>Metempſychoſis,</hi> from the <hi>Cock</hi> into

            <p>The <hi>Efficient</hi> therefore which is ſought for in the <hi>egge,</hi> from whence the <hi>Chicken</hi> is born, is a <hi>ſoul;</hi> and the ſoul of the <hi>Egge:</hi> for according to <hi>Ariſtotle, the ſoul is onely in that thing, whoſe ſoule it is.</hi>

               <hi>or that any thing ſhould be affected by that, which doth not move it)</hi> and therefore the <hi>ſeeds ſoul</hi> ought not to be ſaid to be in it. And yet though the ſoul be the Efficient in the Egge, yet it doth not appear to be derived rather from the <hi>Cock,</hi> or his ſeed, then from the <hi>Hen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is it transferred by a <hi>Metempſychoſis,</hi> or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain tranſlation of the ſoul from the Cock and his ſeed, into the egge, and thence into the Chicken? For how can it be tranſlated into the Egges that are yet to come, and to be conceived after <hi>Coiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi> Unleſs ſome Animate Seed do lurke in the <hi>Hen</hi> all the while; or elſe the ſoul onely without ſeed be tranſlated, that ſo it may be afterwards infuſed into the Egge when the Egg ſhall be made. But neither of theſe is true. For the ſeed is
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:56144:144"/>
no where found in the <hi>Hen:</hi> nor is it poſſible that the <hi>Hen</hi> ſhould after Coition poſſeſs two ſouls; namely, her own, and the ſoul of the future eggs, and Chickens: for the <hi>ſoul is never ſaid to be, but in that whoſe ſoul it is:</hi> much leſſe can one, or more ſouls lye lurking in the <hi>Hen,</hi> that ſo they may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the future <hi>eggs</hi> and <hi>chickens</hi> which are to be born in their order.</p>
            <p>We have deduced theſe paſſages out of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that from them it might appear, how the <hi>Cocks</hi> ſeed doth, according to him, produce the <hi>Chicken</hi> out of the Egge, that ſo ſome light might be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded to this perplext diſquiſition. But ſeeing they do not explaine how this buſineſs is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, nor yet ſalve his own objections; we are ſtill ſticking in the ſame mire, and involved in the ſame doubts, (concerning the Efficient cauſe of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> in the Generation of Animals) nay ſo far are we from receiving any clear ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that we are rather more perplext, and to ſeek, then we were before. And therefore no wonder this excellent Philoſopher was in the ſtreights concerning this matter, and did therefore range together ſo many ſeveral ſorts of efficient cauſes of Animals, and ſometims betake himſelf to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples drawn from <hi>Automata,</hi> things ſeeming to move of themſelves, ſometimes to coagulatedmat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſometimes to Art, Inſtruments, and Motion; ſometimes to the ſoul in the egge, and in the ſeed of the Male, (to illuſtrate the thing) and where he ſeems to be poſitive and ſettle upon ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, concerning what it may be, that ſhould render the <hi>Seed,</hi> (be it of Plants, or Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals) fertile; he renounces Heat and Fire, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper Agents; nor doth he admit any ſuch like faculty; nor can he find out any thing in the ſeed
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:56144:145"/>
it ſelf, which ſhould be fit for the undertaking; but is compelled to admit of a certain Incorpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al extrinſecal thing, which ſhould (like Art, or the Minde) form the <hi>foetus</hi> by wiſedom and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and ordain and inſtitute all things relating to it, to ſome <hi>end</hi> and purpoſe, and to its better ſubſiſtence. He takes, I ſay, ſanctuary, in an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and ignote thing; namely, <hi>in a ſpirit contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the ſeed and frothy ſubſtance, and a certain nature in that ſpirit anſwerable in proportion to the ſubſtance of the Stars.</hi> But what that ſhould be, he no where reveals.</p>

            <head>EXERCIT. XLVIII.</head>
            <p>SInce I have propoſed <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> the chiefeſt of the old <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> and <hi>Hieronymus Fabricius ab Aquapendente,</hi> an eminent <hi>Anatomiſt</hi> amongſt the Modern, to be my Leaders, that from them I might chiefly be enlightened concerning the <hi>generation</hi> of <hi>Animals,</hi> and ſince I cannot better my ſelf by <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> I have reſolved to ſet upon <hi>Fabricius,</hi> to ſee what account he can give of it.</p>
            <p>Now he attempts to give reſolution to three doubts ariſing in the caſe: namely, Firſt, What is the <hi>Efficient</hi> of the <hi>Chicken?</hi> and that he concludes to be the <hi>Males ſeed.</hi> 2. How this appears in the egg to be ſo, and by what means the Cocks <hi>ſeed</hi> doth
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:56144:145"/>
rinder the <hi>egge fertile?</hi> Laſtly, In what Order are the parts of the <hi>Chicken</hi> procreated?</p>
            <p>As for the firſt, it appears out of our <hi>Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> that the <hi>Cock</hi> and his <hi>ſeed</hi> are indeed the <hi>Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe</hi> of <hi>Generation,</hi> but not the <hi>adaequate cauſe;</hi> but that the <hi>Henne</hi> alſo comes in for a ſhare.</p>
            <p>In this place therefore we muſt chiefly enquire, how the <hi>Cocks ſeed</hi> doth fructifie the <hi>Egge,</hi> and raiſe a <hi>Chicken</hi> out of it, which would elſe be <hi>ſubventa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous,</hi> and <hi>improlifical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let us give ear to <hi>Fabricius: Thoſe creatures,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">pag. 38.</note> ſaith he, <hi>that are produced out of an egge, are differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from thoſe which are born out of ſeed; in this, that Oviparous creatures have a matter, out of which the Chicken is corporated, diſtinct and ſeparate from the Agent: but Viviparous creatures have both the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial and efficient cauſe adjoyned, and concorporated together. For the Agent in Oviparous creatures, is the ſeed of the Cock in the feathered kind, which neither is, nor can be in the Egge: but the matter out of which the Chicken is corporated, is the</hi> Chalaza. <hi>Theſe two are much diſtant one from another; for the</hi> Chalaza <hi>is in the Yolk now formed, and fallen into the ſecond</hi> U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus, <hi>and is adjoyned intimately to the egge: on the contrary, the Cocks ſeed remains neer the fundament, and is removed from the</hi> Chalaza <hi>by a large chaſme, and yet by its irradiating faculty it fructifies both the</hi> Uterus, <hi>and all the egge. But in a Viviparous animal, the ſeed is both the Matter, and the Efficient too, both being contracted into one body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſeems to have introduced this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Oviparous</hi> and <hi>Viviparous Animals;</hi> that ſo he might countenance the opinion of <hi>Phyſitians</hi> concerning the <hi>Generation of Man,</hi> or at leaſt not ſubvert it; who conceive that the <hi>ſeeds</hi> of both
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:56144:146"/>
               <hi>Sexes,</hi> ejected together in <hi>coition</hi> are mingled, and according as the one prevailes over the other, ſo the one approves it ſelf the <hi>Efficient,</hi> and the other ſubmits it ſelf to become the <hi>Matter;</hi> ſo that they both conſpiring together, do conſtitute the <hi>conception</hi> in <hi>Viviparous Animals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when he had obſerved, that neither <hi>Seed</hi> nor <hi>Blood</hi> is attracted by means of <hi>coition</hi> into the <hi>womb</hi> of the <hi>Hen,</hi> nor contained there, and could not believe, that any thing emitted from the <hi>cock</hi> in <hi>coition,</hi> could poſſibly arrive ſo farre, nor could finde any thing in the <hi>Egge,</hi> that is adjoined to the <hi>males ſeed,</hi> he was enforced to doubt, how the <hi>ſeed</hi> (which is no where preſent with, nor mingled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>feminine geniture,</hi> nor is adjoined to it, nor doth ſo much as touch it at all) ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the <hi>Chicken,</hi> or fructifie the <hi>Egge?</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when he had before delivered, that from ſome premiſed <hi>coitions,</hi> all the <hi>eggs</hi> that were to be layed that year, were made <hi>prolifical.</hi> For how could it chuſe but ſeem impoſſible, that from the <hi>ſeed</hi> of the <hi>cock</hi> received in the <hi>Spring</hi> (but now departed, loſt, and conſumed) the poſthume <hi>eggs</hi> (layed poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in <hi>Summer</hi> or <hi>Autumne)</hi> ſhould be rendered <hi>fruitfull,</hi> and produce <hi>chickens?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That he might rid his hands of this grand diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie, he coined the fore-ſaid diſtinction; and to ratifie his opinion, he adds three farther Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Firſt, that though the <hi>cocks ſeed</hi> were neither in the Egge, nor at any time in the Womb, nor adjoined to the <hi>material cauſe,</hi> (as it is in <hi>Vivipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Animals)</hi> yet it continues for a whole year in the <hi>hen.</hi> Secondly, to reſerve this <hi>ſeed</hi> in, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents a dark perforation, neer the door of the Womb, wherein the <hi>cock</hi> ſhould depoſite his <hi>ſeed,</hi> and in which (as in a <hi>pouch)</hi> it ſhould be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:56144:146"/>
that thence all the <hi>eggs</hi> might receive their fertility. Laſtly, though the <hi>ſeed</hi> in that <hi>pouch,</hi> neither touch the <hi>womb,</hi> the <hi>egge,</hi> nor the <hi>Ovary,</hi> that by that means it might fructifie the <hi>egge,</hi> or raiſe a <hi>Chicken</hi> out of it; yet, he ſaith, that it gains addreſſes into the very <hi>egge,</hi> by the inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or irradiation of a certain ſpiritual <hi>ſubſtance</hi> in it, and by thoſe arts doth fructifie the <hi>Chalazae,</hi> and ſo model a <hi>Chicken.</hi> And yet by that aſſertion lie ſeems to confirme <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> opinion (who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us that the <hi>female</hi> contributes the <hi>matter,</hi> and the <hi>male</hi> the <hi>efficiency</hi> to <hi>generation)</hi> which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the <hi>Phyſitians</hi> poſition concerning the commixture of ſeeds: for whoſe ſake he ſeems to have introduced his fore-ſaid diſtinction between <hi>Oviparous,</hi> and <hi>Viviparous Animals.</hi> And that this his opinion may ſeem more probable, he recites what changes and alterations the <hi>ſeed</hi> reſerved in the <hi>Teſticles</hi> and <hi>ſeminary Veſicles,</hi> not yet emitted, doth procure in <hi>Animals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to take no notice that all this makes litle to his purpoſe: (for the queſtion in chief is not, How the <hi>Cocks ſeed</hi> doth render the <hi>egge</hi> fertile? but rather, How it doth frame and erect a <hi>Chicken</hi> out of the <hi>Egge?)</hi> all thoſe things which he hath conjured up to guard his opinion, ſeem for the moſt part falſe, or very ſuſpicious; as appears by our Obſervations delivered in this <hi>Hiſtory.</hi> For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is that blinde perforation in the root of the <hi>rump</hi> (which he calls the <hi>purſe,</hi> or <hi>pouch)</hi> deſtined to cubbard up the <hi>Cocks ſeed,</hi> nor is there (as we have ſaid) any <hi>ſeed</hi> at all found in it: but it is an empty unprovided thing both in the <hi>Cock,</hi> and <hi>Henne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what he would have by his <hi>ſpiritual</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and irradiation, he is yet to acquaint us, as
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:56144:147"/>
alſo what ſubſtance hee underſtands that to be, which he affirms, doth by its virtue vivifie the <hi>egg,</hi> Whether a <hi>corporeal,</hi> or <hi>formal</hi> ſubſtance, which ſhould proceed from the irradiation of the <hi>ſeed,</hi> (which lies at rooſt in the <hi>pouch)</hi> and (which is chiefly required) ſhould faſhion the <hi>Chicken</hi> out of the <hi>egge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, in my minde, he ſaith no more in ſubſtance then this: <hi>It makes the Chicken, becauſe it irradiates the Egge; and forms it, becauſe it vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies it:</hi> and ſo he labours to reveal and illuſtrate the obſcure manner of formation, by one more obſcure then it ſelf. For the ſame ſcruple returns entire; namely, how the <hi>Cocks ſeed,</hi> a meer <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangent,</hi> an <hi>external efficient,</hi> and disjoyned by place, remaining in the <hi>pouch,</hi> can faſhion the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour parts (that is, the <hi>Heart, Liver, Lungs,</hi> and <hi>Guts,</hi> &amp;c.) in the <hi>egge</hi> out of the <hi>Chalazae,</hi> by <hi>Irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation?</hi> Unleſs he will have it ſitting in its chair of State, like the Creator of all, only by this word of comman, <hi>Fiant,</hi> Let all things be ſo; (namely the <hi>Bones</hi> for <hi>Support,</hi> the <hi>Muſcles</hi> for <hi>Motion,</hi> the <hi>Organs</hi> for <hi>Senſe;</hi> the <hi>Members</hi> for <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> the <hi>Intrals</hi> for <hi>Concoction,</hi> and the like) and ſo order, and by its beams or influence conſtitute all things to their proper end, with providence, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and art. For neither doth <hi>Fabricius</hi> expound the manner, nor yet demonſtrate the <hi>ſeed</hi> to be of ſuch force and virtue, that (without coming neer) it can effect all this; eſpecially ſince an <hi>egge</hi> can, by <hi>Incubation</hi> of a ſtranger fowle, or any other fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering warmth; as in <hi>dung,</hi> in a <hi>matt,</hi> or an <hi>oven,</hi> though never ſo remote from the <hi>pouch</hi> of its own <hi>mother-hen,</hi> be quickened, and produce a <hi>foetus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame difficulty therefore lyes ſtill upon our hands; namely, How the <hi>Cocks ſeed</hi> is the <hi>Efficient</hi>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:56144:147"/>
               <hi>cauſe</hi> of the <hi>Chicken?</hi> nor is it any whit ſalved by the influence of this ſpiritual ſubſtance. For though we ſhould grant, that the <hi>ſeed</hi> is reſerved in the <hi>purſe,</hi> and that by a <hi>Metamorphoſis,</hi> and <hi>Irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation,</hi> it did corporate the <hi>chicken</hi> out of the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lazae:</hi> yet the ſcruple would ſtick no leſs by us; namely, How the <hi>Intrals</hi> of the <hi>Chicken</hi> are model<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. But theſe things are long ſince confuted by us.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, when we are in queſt of the <hi>efficient cauſe</hi> of the <hi>Chicken,</hi> we muſt look for it in the <hi>Egge,</hi> and not dormant in a <hi>pouch;</hi> and for ſuch a one, which, though the <hi>egg</hi> now grown ſtale, were diſtant many miles from the <hi>Hen,</hi> and laid under an other <hi>Hen</hi> (as a <hi>Turkey-hen,</hi> or <hi>African-hen)</hi> to be hatched; or (as in <hi>Aegypt)</hi> under warm <hi>ſand,</hi> or <hi>dung,</hi> or in an <hi>Oven</hi> proper for the purpoſe, would ſtill raiſe up a <hi>chicken,</hi> of the ſame <hi>ſpecies,</hi> and very like the <hi>Cock</hi> and <hi>Hen</hi> that were its <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parents;</hi> or elſe (in caſe the <hi>Cock</hi> were of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kinde) a mungrel of-ſpring, of a mixt <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> and reſemblance.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the knot remains to be united, which neither <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> nor <hi>Fabricius</hi> have looſened; namely, How the ſeed of the <hi>Male,</hi> or Cock, doth produce the <hi>chicken</hi> out of the egge, or is to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the <hi>Efficient cauſe</hi> of the <hi>chicken,</hi> eſpecially, ſince it is neither preſent, tangent, nor adjoined to the <hi>Egge?</hi> And though almoſt all men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the <hi>Male,</hi> and its <hi>ſeed</hi> are the <hi>Efficient cauſe</hi> of the <hi>Foetus;</hi> no man yet hath ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently declared, how it can be done, eſpecially in our <hi>Hen-egg.</hi>

            <p>THe diſquiſition of the <hi>Efficient</hi> is exceeding difficult; (as we have ſaid) and that the rather, becauſe ſo many names are attributed to it.

            </p>
            <p>And indeed the <hi>Omnipotent Creator,</hi> doth in none of his works more manifeſtly reveale the preſence of his Deity, then in the Fabrick and Structure of Animals.

For it is evident e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, by what we have delivered, concerning the Generation of <hi>Oviparous</hi> Animals, and others, that neither the Opinion of <hi>Phyſitians,</hi> deducing Generation from the mixture of the Seeds of both Sexes, nor <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> neither, eſtabliſhing the ſeed of the Male for the Efficient, and the Menſtruous Blood for the <hi>material Cauſe,</hi> are to be embraced:

that the <hi>foetus,</hi> or any part of it is formed of the ſeed ſo entertained by the <hi>womb,</hi> or caſt into it: or, that the <hi>ſeed</hi> of the <hi>Cock</hi> (as an <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſe,</hi> or <hi>Operatour)</hi> is any where reſerved in the <hi>Hen,</hi> which (as he conceives) draws <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>nutriment</hi> from her into the <hi>Womb,</hi> to <hi>ſupport</hi> the <hi>foetus</hi> which it hath made. For the conditions which he himſelf according to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> reputes neceſſary, will be found wanting: namely, that the <hi>foetus</hi> ought to be made of that which actually is in being, and doth pre-exiſt: and that the <hi>Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi> is nouriſhed by that which is preſent with it, and in the ſame place where it ſelf is firſt conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted: As alſo, that it ſhould be made by that which doth operate being immediately conjoyned to it; and ought to be the ſame thing, by which the <hi>chicken</hi> is preſerved, and augmented all its life-time. For the <hi>cocks ſeed</hi> (whether <hi>Animate,</hi> or <hi>Inanimate,</hi> it matters nothing) is not at all in the <hi>Egge,</hi> not in the <hi>Uterus,</hi> preſent, and conjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; nor in the <hi>matter</hi> whence the <hi>chicken</hi> is fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as neither in the <hi>Chicken</hi> it ſelf now begun, that ſo it may either frame, or perfect it.</p>
            <p>He miſcarries likewiſe, when he goes about to illuſtrate his opinion concerning the <hi>Animal ſeed,</hi> by alluſion to that of <hi>Plants,</hi> and <hi>Maſt:</hi> becauſe he did not underſtand the difference alledged by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> between the <hi>Geniture</hi> proceedings by <hi>coi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and the firſt conception made out of both Sexes; nor did obſerve that an egge might be firſt conceived in the <hi>Cluſter</hi> of the <hi>Vitellary</hi> (without the tranſlation of any <hi>Geniture</hi> from Male and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male into the <hi>Uterus.)</hi> Nor did he apprehend that the <hi>Uterus,</hi> even for ſome time after <hi>Coition,</hi> is quite void of any <hi>matter</hi> at all, either tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the <hi>Parents,</hi> or made by <hi>Coition,</hi> or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:56144:150"/>
any other way. Nor had he read, or at leaſt obſerved <hi>Fabricius</hi> his experiment; namely, that after ſome <hi>Coitions</hi> of the <hi>Cock,</hi> the <hi>Hen</hi> may be ſo fructified, that from that time for the whole ſucceeding year ſhe may lay all Prolifical Egges: though ſhe have not in the interim converſed with the <hi>cock,</hi> whereby each particular <hi>egge</hi> might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive fecundity; nor yet retained ſo long the <hi>ſeed</hi> ſhe formerly received.</p>
            <p>This is agreed upon by univerſal conſent; that all <hi>Animals</hi> whatſoever, which ariſe from Male and Female, are generated by the <hi>coition</hi> of both Sexes; and ſo begotten as it were <hi>per contagium aliquod,</hi> by a kind of <hi>contagion.</hi> In like manner as <hi>Phyſitians</hi> obſerve, that contagious diſeaſes (as the <hi>Leproſie,</hi> the <hi>Pox,</hi> the <hi>Plague,</hi> and <hi>Pthiſick)</hi> do propagate their infection, and beget themſelves in bodies yet ſound and untoucht, meerly by an <hi>extrinſecal contact;</hi> nay ſometimes onely by the <hi>breath,</hi> and <hi>per</hi>

So that, that which had the firſt touch, begets an <hi>Univocal</hi> like it ſelf, not as touching at this inſtant, nor yet now actually in being, nor as preſent, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, but meerly becauſe it once hath touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Of ſo great operation and energy is <hi>Contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And perhaps the ſame thing obtains in the <hi>Generation</hi> of <hi>Animals.</hi> For <hi>Fiſhes egges,</hi> which acquire their growth abroad at their own diſpoſe, without any <hi>Male-ſeed,</hi> (and therefore do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt live without it) being beſprinkled with the <hi>Males prolifical milkey ſubſtance,</hi> and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tinctured from without, do generate <hi>fiſhes.</hi> Tis not, I ſay, an intromiſſion, or intimate reception of the maſculine <hi>ſeed</hi> into each particular <hi>egge,</hi>

            <head>What the Efficient cauſe of Animals is; and what its Conditions.</head>
            <head>EXERCIT. L.</head>
            <p>THat therefore we may in ſome proportion dive into the knowledge of the efficient cauſe, (ſo far forth as concerns our preſent contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) we muſt take notice firſt of the <hi>Inſtruments</hi> or <hi>Mediums</hi> which pertain to the <hi>efficient</hi> or <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming cauſe:</hi> and into this rank is the <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female</hi> for to be reduced, likewiſe the <hi>Geniture,</hi> and the <hi>egg,</hi> and its firſt <hi>rudiment.</hi> For ſome <hi>males</hi> (and <hi>females</hi> too) are <hi>barren,</hi> or <hi>unfruitful.</hi> And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the <hi>males geniture</hi> is ſometimes more, and ſometimes leſs fertile: for the <hi>Semen Virile</hi> as it is barely conteined in the <hi>Seminal Veſicles</hi> (except it be rarified into froth by the ſpirits, and force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably leap out) is <hi>unfruitful.</hi> And this too, poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly is not always ſucceſsful. Nor are the <hi>Papulae,</hi> or <hi>Yolks</hi> bred in the <hi>Cluſter</hi> of the <hi>Ovary,</hi> or the <hi>Egges</hi> conteined in the Womb, all preſently fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <p>Now I call that <hi>fruitful,</hi> which (except ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment happen from without) will attaine its deſigned end, by the <hi>efficient</hi> power implanted in it, and compaſs that, for whoſe ſake it is ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. So that <hi>Cock</hi> is reputed <hi>fertile,</hi> who cauſes his <hi>Hens</hi> to lay oftner, and more conſtantly, and alſo renders their <hi>egges generative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So likewiſe that <hi>Hen</hi> is <hi>fruitful,</hi> which is uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in laying <hi>egges,</hi> and hath a good retention in order to the <hi>prolifical</hi> vertue imparted to her from
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:56144:152"/>
the <hi>Cock.</hi> So the <hi>Cluſter</hi> of the <hi>Papulae,</hi> and <hi>Ovary</hi> it ſelf are counted fertile, when they are well fraught with ſtore of <hi>rudiments</hi> and <hi>foundations</hi> of <hi>egges,</hi> and thoſe mature.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe that <hi>egge</hi> is <hi>fertile,</hi> which is fartheſt from being <hi>ſubventaneous</hi> or <hi>addle,</hi> and doth leſs faile in producing a <hi>Chicken,</hi> howſoever you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of it, either to <hi>Incubation,</hi> or any other foſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring-heat.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſuch an efficient of the <hi>Chicken</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, as may impart virtue to all theſe, by which they may be fructified, and obtain an <hi>effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient power;</hi> for the ſame thing, or at leaſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing proportionable to it, is in them all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing <hi>fecundity</hi> upon them. And the <hi>Inquiry</hi> is the ſame, namely, what it is in the <hi>Egge,</hi> that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it fertile: what in the <hi>Ovary,</hi> and what in the <hi>Papula;</hi> likewiſe what in the <hi>female,</hi> and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the <hi>ſeed</hi> and <hi>Cock</hi> himſelf, &amp;c. What in the <hi>Blood,</hi> and <hi>Punctum ſaliens,</hi> or firſt <hi>genital particle,</hi> from whence afterwards the <hi>riſe, fabrick,</hi> and order of all the other parts is derived: as alſo, what is it in the <hi>Chicken</hi> it ſelf, from whence it grows ſturdy and active, attains its youth and maturity, lives a healthy life, and a long.</p>
            <p>Nor is that inquiry unlike this, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, what both <hi>male,</hi> and <hi>female (Cock</hi> and <hi>Hen)</hi> confer to the <hi>fertile egge;</hi> or what it is which proceeds from both, towards the <hi>perfection</hi> and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of the <hi>chicken;</hi> as whether the <hi>egge, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, matter,</hi> and <hi>nutriment</hi> proceed from the <hi>female,</hi> and the <hi>Operative virtue</hi> from the <hi>male;</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a certain <hi>contagion</hi> ſent forth by <hi>coition,</hi> or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by it, or received from it, remaining in the <hi>Hen</hi> or <hi>Egges,</hi> work upon the matter of the <hi>egge;</hi> or attract a nutriment from the <hi>Hen,</hi> concocting
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:56144:152"/>
and diſtributing it, to the encreaſe of the <hi>egge,</hi> and afterwards to the production of the <hi>chicken:</hi> Or laſtly, whether all that which relates to the <hi>form, ſoul,</hi> and <hi>fecundity,</hi> do proceed from the <hi>male;</hi> but from the <hi>female,</hi> whatever relates to the <hi>matter, conſtitution, place,</hi> and <hi>ſuſtenance.</hi> For in <hi>animals</hi> (whoſe Sexes are diſtinct) it is ſo contrived, that becauſe the <hi>female</hi> cannot alone generate, nouriſh, &amp; protect the <hi>foetus,</hi> the <hi>male</hi> is joined as yoke-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the task (as the Superior, and more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent <hi>progenitor)</hi> to ſupply her failings; and ſo to correct the infirmity of the <hi>Subventaneous eggs,</hi> and inſpire them with fertility.</p>
            <p>For as a <hi>chicken</hi> born of an <hi>egge,</hi> is indebted to that <hi>egge</hi> for his <hi>body, ſoul,</hi> and <hi>principal</hi> or <hi>genital part:</hi> So is the <hi>egge</hi> for all it has, to the <hi>Henne;</hi> and the <hi>Henne</hi> alſo for her <hi>fecundity</hi> to the <hi>Cock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whether the <hi>male</hi> be the firſt and principal cauſe of the <hi>progeny,</hi> or whether the <hi>male</hi> and the <hi>female</hi> are intermediate and <hi>Inſtrumental cauſes</hi> ſet awork by <hi>nature,</hi> or the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>Supreme Genitor,</hi> we have here an occaſion offered to enquire; and it is a very worthy and neceſſary one, becauſe all perfect ſcience depends upon the knowledge of all cauſes: and therefore to the plenary comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Generation, we muſt aſcend from the laſt and loweſt efficient to the very <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>moſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme,</hi> and know them all.</p>
            <p>But as for the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>higheſt Efficient</hi> of the <hi>chicken,</hi> we ſhall determine what that is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, (when we treat of the <hi>Efficient</hi> of all other <hi>Animals)</hi> but what kind of one it is, we will here declare.</p>
            <p>The firſt <hi>condition,</hi> or <hi>qualification,</hi> of the firſt and <hi>primary Efficient</hi> properly ſo called, is, that
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:56144:153"/>
it be the <hi>firſt</hi> &amp; <hi>principal fructifier,</hi> from whence all <hi>intermediate cauſes</hi> aſſume their derived <hi>fecundity.</hi> For inſtance, the <hi>chicken</hi> is derived from the <hi>Punctum ſaliens</hi> in the <hi>egg,</hi> not only in regard of its <hi>bulk,</hi> but alſo, and that chiefly in regard of its <hi>ſoul;</hi> the <hi>Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum ſaliens,</hi> or <hi>Heart</hi> is derived from the <hi>egg,</hi> the <hi>egg</hi> from the <hi>Hens,</hi> and the <hi>Hens fertility</hi> from the <hi>Cock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another requiſite or condition of the <hi>primary Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi> is deſumed <hi>ex opere facto,</hi> from the <hi>production</hi> it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Chicken:</hi> becauſe that is the <hi>prime ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,</hi> in which the reaſon of the <hi>effect</hi> doth chiefly appear. But becauſe <hi>every Generative efficient</hi> doth generate its like, and the iſſue is of a mixt nature; the <hi>firſt efficient</hi> muſt needs be mixt too.</p>
            <p>Now I therefore pronounce their iſſue to be of a mixt nature, becauſe, the mixture of both <hi>parents</hi> is refulgent in it, both in the <hi>figure</hi> and <hi>lineaments</hi> of the <hi>body,</hi> and all its <hi>parts;</hi> as in <hi>complexion</hi> or <hi>colors, moles</hi> or <hi>ſpots, diſeaſes,</hi> and other accidents of the <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi> Likewiſe in the <hi>ſoul</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> and <hi>functions</hi> (as in like <hi>manners, docility, gate,</hi> and <hi>voice)</hi> ſuch a kinde of temperature is diſcoverable. For as we ſay that a <hi>ſimilar mixt body</hi> is made of the <hi>Elements,</hi> becauſe their virtues, <hi>heat, cold, moiſture,</hi> and <hi>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ccity,</hi> are found compounded in the ſame <hi>ſimilar body:</hi> ſo likewiſe the <hi>paternal</hi> and <hi>maternal handy-work</hi> may be tracked and pointed out both in the <hi>body, ſoul,</hi> and other <hi>accidents</hi> of the <hi>Chicken:</hi> (which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the temperature, or happen unto it) for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; In a <hi>Mule,</hi> the <hi>ſoul, body, manners,</hi> and <hi>voice</hi> of both <hi>parents; (viz.</hi> of the <hi>Mare,</hi> and the <hi>Aſs)</hi> are apparent. So alſo in thoſe <hi>Chickens</hi> which are the Ofspring of the <hi>dunghill-hen,</hi> and <hi>Cock-Pheaſant:</hi> and in that mungrel <hi>Curre,</hi> which is produced by the ſodomie of a <hi>Wolf</hi> and a <hi>Bitch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since therefore the <hi>Chicken</hi> reſembles both <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:56144:153"/>
and is a mixt <hi>Effect:</hi> the <hi>generant primary cauſe</hi> (which it reſembles) muſt needs be mixt likewiſe. Therefore that which frames the <hi>Chicken</hi> in the <hi>Egge</hi> is a mixt nature (as being united, or compounded of both) and the work of both <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</hi> And if any <hi>contagion</hi> do ariſe or remain in the <hi>female</hi> upon <hi>coition,</hi> (in which they two are mixt, and become as it were one <hi>Animal)</hi> that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo will be of a mixt nature or power, by which the <hi>egge</hi> ſhall afterwards become <hi>fertile,</hi> and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieve a <hi>plaſtical virtue,</hi> which is an <hi>Agent</hi> of a mixt nature, or a mixt <hi>efficient-Inſtrument,</hi> produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a <hi>Chicken</hi> of a mixt <hi>nature</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>The <hi>contagion,</hi> I ſay; becauſe <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is altogether refractory to experience her ſelf: namely, where he ſaith, <hi>that ſome part of the</hi> Foetus <hi>is inſtantly made upon coition.</hi> Nor is that true neither, which ſome of the <hi>Moderns</hi> averre, namely, <hi>that the ſoul of the future chicken is in the egge:</hi> for that is no whit the <hi>chickens ſoul,</hi> which is in no part of the <hi>chickens body.</hi> Nor can the <hi>ſoul</hi> be ſaid either to be begotten, or left behind preſently upon <hi>coition:</hi> for otherwiſe there ſhould be two <hi>ſouls</hi> in a <hi>Woman with child.</hi> Therefore till it be determined what the <hi>efficient</hi> of the <hi>egge</hi> is, which is of a mixt nature, and ought to remaine preſent upon <hi>coition:</hi> give me leave to call it <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagium,</hi> Contact, or contagion.</p>
            <p>But where the <hi>contagion</hi> lurks in the <hi>female</hi> after <hi>coition,</hi> and how it is communicated and derived to the <hi>egge,</hi> requires a more exact Diſquiſition: and we will afterwards fall upon it, when we treat generally of the <hi>conception</hi> of <hi>females.</hi> It ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, in the mean time to have taken notice, that it muſt needs be the fate of the <hi>firſt efficient</hi> (in which the reaſon of the future off-ſpring doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide)
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:56144:154"/>

            <p>The <hi>third condition</hi> of the <hi>Primary Efficient</hi> is, that either it impart <hi>motion</hi> ſucceſſively to all its <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate inſtruments,</hi> or elſe employ them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, but that it ſelfe be <hi>ſubſervient</hi> to none: whence a doubt ariſes, whether the <hi>Cock</hi> be the <hi>Primary Efficient</hi> in the <hi>Generation</hi> of the <hi>chicken,</hi> or have any before, or ſuperior to him.

            </p>
            <p>From theſe recited <hi>Conditions</hi> of the <hi>Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal cauſe,</hi> it may ſeem to inſue, that the <hi>cock,</hi> or at leaſt the <hi>cock</hi> with the <hi>hen,</hi> are the <hi>Primary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficients</hi> in the <hi>Generation</hi> of the <hi>chicken:</hi> for the <hi>chicken</hi> is like them; nor can it be thought to be more noble then its <hi>Efficients</hi> or <hi>Parents.</hi> I ſhall therefore adde one condition more to the <hi>Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry efficient,</hi> by which perhaps it may appear that the <hi>Male</hi> is not the <hi>Primary,</hi> but the <hi>Inſtrumentall cauſe;</hi> namely, that it is required of the <hi>Primary efficient</hi> in the <hi>fabrick</hi> of the <hi>Chicken,</hi> that he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy <hi>Skill, Providence, Wiſdome, Goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> far above the <hi>capacity</hi> of our <hi>rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal ſoules;</hi> as that, in which the <hi>Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>future</hi> work, ought to conſiſt, and which ought likewiſe to act for ſome deſtinated end, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing and perfecting all parts, forming the ſmalleſt and moſt inconſiderable <hi>appendixes</hi> of the <hi>Chicken</hi> for ſome uſe, and employment: not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding onely for the <hi>ſtructure</hi> of the creature, but for its <hi>wellfare, ornament,</hi> and <hi>defence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the <hi>male,</hi> or his <hi>ſeed,</hi> either in, or after <hi>coition,</hi> is not ſo qualified, that <hi>Art, Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> may be attributed to it.</p>
            <p>Which things being pondered, the <hi>Male</hi> ſeems to be an <hi>Inſtrumental efficient,</hi> as well as his <hi>ſeed,</hi> and the <hi>Hen</hi> likewiſe as well as the <hi>Egge</hi> ſhe <hi>laies.</hi> And therefore we muſt take our flight to a more <hi>Primary, Superior,</hi> and more <hi>excellent cauſe;</hi> to which we may juſtly attribute <hi>Providence, Underſtanding,</hi>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:56144:155"/>
               <hi>Art,</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs;</hi> and ſuch a one as is as much ſuperiour to its effects and Workmanſhip, as an <hi>Architect</hi> is better then a <hi>Barn</hi> he ſets up; a <hi>Prince</hi> then his <hi>Officers,</hi> or an <hi>Artiſt,</hi> then his owne <hi>hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore both <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female</hi> are but <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental efficients, ſubſervient</hi> to the high <hi>Creator,</hi> or <hi>Protogenitor.</hi> And in this ſenſe it is truly ſaid, that the <hi>Sun,</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> beget an <hi>Animal,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Autumn</hi> do inſue upon the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching</hi> and <hi>Receding Sun,</hi> at which times com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, the <hi>generation</hi> and <hi>corruption</hi> of <hi>Animals</hi> happen. So the chiefeſt of <hi>Philoſophers. The firſt</hi> 
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>Movers motion is not the cauſe of generation and corruption, but the motion of the</hi> Oblique circle: <hi>for that is continual, and hath alſo two Motions: for if generation and corruption were to be always continual, it were neceſſary that ſomething ſhould be always mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, leaſt thoſe mutations ſhould fail; but yet it muſt have two motions, leaſt one onely of the two mutations ſhould ſucceed. The cauſe therefore of the continuity is the motion of the Univerſe, but the declivity it ſelfe is the cauſe of the Approach, and the Receſſes. For it comes to paſs, that He,</hi> (namely the Sun) <hi>is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times neerer, and ſometimes farther from the earth. And when the Interval is inequal, the motion muſt be inequal too. If then he therefore generate becauſe he approaches neerer: and cauſe corruption, becauſe he remotes and recedeth farther from the earth: Then it follows that if he often do generate, it is becauſe he often approacheth: and if he often cauſe corruption, it is becauſe he often recedeth. For contraries have contrary cauſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore in the <hi>Spring</hi> all things flouriſh and grow; (namely, from the <hi>Approach</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> who is the <hi>Common Father,</hi> and <hi>Parent:</hi> or
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:56144:156"/>
at leaſt the immediate and Common <hi>Inſtrument</hi> in Generation imployed by the <hi>high Creator)</hi> and that not <hi>Vegetables</hi> onely, but <hi>Animals</hi> too: nor they onely which are <hi>Spontaneous</hi> iſſues, but thoſe alſo which are generated by <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female.</hi> As if at the approach of this noble <hi>Planet,</hi> ſoft <hi>Venus</hi> did deſcend from the <hi>Skie,</hi> with <hi>Cupid</hi> and the <hi>Graces</hi> entertained for her <hi>Retinue,</hi> inciting and provoking all living things, by their <hi>Allegeance</hi> to Love, to propagate their kind. Or (as it is in the <hi>Fable)</hi> as if <hi>Saturne</hi> did then become an <hi>Eunuch,</hi> and threw his <hi>maſculine evidences</hi> into the <hi>Sea,</hi> to raiſe a <hi>Foam,</hi> which might give birth to <hi>Venus:</hi> For in the Generation of <hi>Animals, Superat tener omnibus humor; A gentle dew doth moiſten all</hi> (as the <hi>Poet</hi> hath it) and the <hi>genital parts</hi> doe foam and ſtrut with <hi>Seed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore the <hi>cock</hi> and <hi>Hen</hi> are chiefly <hi>fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> in <hi>Spring,</hi> as if the Sun, or Heavens, Nature, the Soul of the <hi>Univerſe,</hi> or the <hi>Omnipotent Deity</hi> (for theſe are <hi>Synonoma</hi>'s) were a <hi>Superiour</hi> and <hi>Diviner</hi> cauſe of Generation then they. So, <hi>Sol &amp; homo generant hominem;</hi> The <hi>Sun,</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> beget a <hi>Man</hi> (that is to ſay) the <hi>Sun</hi> by <hi>Man</hi> as its <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> And ſo, the <hi>Creator</hi> of all things, and the <hi>cock,</hi> beget an <hi>egge,</hi> and out of an <hi>egge</hi> a <hi>chicken:</hi> namely, by the conſtant <hi>approach</hi> and <hi>receſſe</hi> of the <hi>Sun:</hi> who according to the will, and decree of the Almighty, is emploied in the generation of all things.</p>
            <p>We conclude therefore that the <hi>male</hi> (though he be a <hi>Primary</hi> and more excellent <hi>efficient</hi> then the <hi>female)</hi> is only an <hi>Inſtrumental Efficient:</hi> and doth himſelfe, no leſs then the <hi>Female,</hi> owe his <hi>fecundity,</hi> or <hi>generative Virtue</hi> to the <hi>Sun</hi> his <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditour:</hi> and therefore the artifice and providence
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:56144:156"/>
(which we diſcover in his workmanſhip) doth not proceed from <hi>him,</hi> but <hi>God.</hi> For the <hi>Male</hi> uſes neither <hi>counſel,</hi> nor <hi>underſtanding</hi> in <hi>generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> nor doe <hi>Men</hi> generate by any <hi>part</hi> of their <hi>reaſonable ſoule,</hi> but by a <hi>faculty</hi> of their <hi>vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive:</hi> which is not inrouled amongſt the <hi>primary,</hi> and more <hi>devine powers</hi> of the <hi>ſoule,</hi> but the <hi>meaneſt,</hi> and <hi>baſeſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since therefore in the <hi>ſtructure</hi> of a <hi>chicken, Art</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> are no leſs viſible, then in the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> himſelfe, and the <hi>creation</hi> of the <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe:</hi> we muſt needs acknowledge, that in the <hi>generation</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> there is an <hi>Efficient cauſe</hi> more excellent then <hi>man</hi> himſelfe: or elſe that the <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative faculty,</hi> or that part of the <hi>ſoule,</hi> which raiſeth this pile of man, and doth conſerve it, is much more <hi>divine</hi> and excellent, and doth more perſonate the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> then the <hi>Rational part</hi> it ſelfe: whoſe worth and dignity we more cry up, then all the faculties of the <hi>ſoule</hi> beſide; though ſhe were <hi>Regent</hi> and <hi>Empreſs</hi> of the reſt, and held them all as <hi>Tributaries</hi> to her.

            <p>Wherefore (in my opinion) he is the right and pious <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> who deduceth the <hi>generations</hi> of all things from that <hi>eternal</hi> and <hi>Omnipotent Deity,</hi> upon whoſe pleaſure the <hi>Univerſe</hi> dependeth.

the names of veneration are moſt due) whether that of <hi>Deus,</hi> or <hi>Natura naturans,</hi> or <hi>Anima mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di.</hi> For all men underſtand <hi>him</hi> to be that <hi>Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of all things, which is <hi>Omnipotent,</hi> and <hi>everlaſting,</hi> the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Creator of all things, preſerving, and perpetuating the fluxibility of mortall creatures, by the ſeveral viciſſitudes of generations: which being every where preſent, is no leſs aſſiſtant to the particular operations of natural things, then of the whole Univerſe; that ſo he may propagate all Animals by his Deity, Providence, Art, and divine Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</hi> Whereof ſome are <hi>ſpontaneous</hi> births, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>Univocal efficient;</hi> ſome born by the aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciat <hi>operations</hi> of <hi>male</hi> and <hi>female,</hi> ſome from one <hi>Sex</hi> onely; others by other <hi>intermediate Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> which <hi>Inſtruments</hi> are ſometimes fewer, ſometimes more, ſometimes <hi>univocal,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>equivocal,</hi> and <hi>ex accidenti</hi> caſual.</p>
            <p>But all <hi>natural bodies</hi> whatever are both the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions,</hi> and <hi>Inſtruments</hi> of that <hi>Great God;</hi> and are either onely <hi>natural,</hi> as <hi>Heat, Spirit,</hi> the <hi>tepidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> or <hi>warmth</hi> of the <hi>Air,</hi> or <hi>Putrefaction,</hi> &amp;c. or <hi>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi> alſo; for he makes uſe in ſome ſort of the <hi>motions, faculties,</hi> and <hi>ſouls</hi> of <hi>animals</hi> themſelves, in order to the perfection of the <hi>Univerſe,</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation</hi> of <hi>Animals.</hi>

            <p>It appears therefore in ſome proportion, what the <hi>males</hi> contribution is towards <hi>generation;</hi> namely, the <hi>cock</hi> brings that ſame virtue to the <hi>egg,</hi> by which of a <hi>ſubventaneous</hi> it becomes a <hi>fertile</hi> one, as <hi>vegetable Fruits</hi> borrow from the <hi>Summer heat</hi> to ripen themſelves, and fructifie their <hi>ſeeds;</hi> and which induceth <hi>fertility</hi> into <hi>ſpontaneous produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi> by which from worms they become a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker-worm, and from a Canker-worm, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the worm called <hi>Aurelia,</hi> and from an <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi>

<pb n="274" facs="tcp:56144:160"/>
is to be rejected (whereby they decree that the three <hi>principal</hi> and <hi>eldeſt parts,</hi> the <hi>Brain,</hi> the <hi>Heart,</hi> and the <hi>Liver,</hi> do together ſpring out of the ſmall bladders or bubbles) ſo neither can I aſſent to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> himſelf, who concludes that the <hi>Heart</hi> is this <hi>firſt genital</hi> and <hi>animate particle.</hi> For the truth is, I am perſwaded that this Prerogative is onely due to the <hi>Blood:</hi> for the <hi>blood</hi> is it which is firſt ſeen in <hi>Generation.</hi> And that not onely in an <hi>Egg,</hi> but in every <hi>Foetus,</hi> and <hi>animal conception</hi> whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: As ſhall plainly appear anon.</p>
            <p>There appears, I ſay, from the beginning, <hi>Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum Rubrum ſaliens, Veſicula pulſans, Fibraeque inde deductae,</hi> the Red capering Point, the Panting Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicle, and the Fibers deduced thence, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>blood.</hi> And ſo farre as I could poſſibly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern by accurate Inſpection, the <hi>Blood</hi> is formed before the <hi>Punctum ſaliens,</hi> and is endowed with <hi>vital heat,</hi> before it moves by <hi>pulſe;</hi> and in it, and from it doth the <hi>pulſation</hi> begin. For I have found it true by ſundry experiments both in an <hi>egge,</hi> and elſewhere, that the <hi>blood</hi> is it, in which (ſo long as the <hi>vital heat</hi> is not quite extinct) reſideth the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of reviving.</p>
            <p>And ſince the <hi>Veſicula pulſans,</hi> and the <hi>Fibres</hi> containing <hi>blood</hi> which are derived from it, are ſeen before any other parts; I conceive it conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to reaſon, that the <hi>blood</hi> is made before his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles; that is to ſay, the thing <hi>contained,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the thing <hi>containing;</hi> for the latter is made to be ſerviceable to the former. And therefore it is moſt probable, That the <hi>Veines,</hi> and <hi>Fibres,</hi> and then the <hi>Veſicle,</hi> and after it the <hi>Heart,</hi> as being <hi>Inſtruments</hi> deſtined to receive and houſe the <hi>blood,</hi> are erected for the tranſmiſſion, and diſtribution of it, and that the <hi>blood</hi> is the <hi>primary particle</hi> of the <hi>body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:56144:160"/>
And this is manifeſt by many Obſervations; but chiefly, in that ſome <hi>living creatures</hi> (and ſuch too as have <hi>blood)</hi> live a good while without any <hi>pulſe</hi> at all; and ſome become like <hi>Anchorites</hi> all the <hi>Winter</hi> long, and yet ſurvive, though their <hi>Hearts</hi> within them do reſpite all their <hi>motions,</hi> and their <hi>Lungs</hi> make <hi>Holy-day,</hi> and forbear <hi>reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;</hi> like thoſe perſons, who in a <hi>Syncope, Lipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymia,</hi> or <hi>Hyſterical paſſions,</hi> lie half-dead without the motion of the Pulſe.</p>
            <p>Being therefore aſcertained out of thoſe things which I have obſerved in an <hi>Egge,</hi> and the <hi>diſſection</hi> of <hi>Animals</hi> while they were alive, I conclude (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Ariſtotle)</hi> that the <hi>blood</hi> is the firſt <hi>Genital particle,</hi> and that the <hi>Heart</hi> is its Inſtrument de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for its <hi>Circulation.</hi> For the <hi>Hearts</hi> buſineſs or function is the propulſation or driving forth of the <hi>blood,</hi> as appeares in all <hi>Animals</hi> that have <hi>blood:</hi> and the office of the <hi>Veſicula pulſans</hi> is the very ſame, (in the <hi>generation</hi> of the <hi>Chicken)</hi> which I have ſhewed to many perſons, in the firſt <hi>conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions</hi> of <hi>Animals,</hi> (as well as in an <hi>Egge)</hi> when it hath been leſs then a <hi>Spark,</hi> panting, and in its motion, drawing it ſelf together, and ſo ſqueez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the <hi>blood</hi> contained in it, and by relaxing it ſelf again, receiving and entertaining <hi>blood</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh.</p>
            <p>And hence the prerogative and antiquity of the <hi>blood</hi> appeares, ſeeing that the <hi>Pulſe</hi> proceedeth from it. For there being two parts of <hi>Pulſation; (Diſtention,</hi> and <hi>Contraction,</hi> or <hi>Syſtole,</hi> and <hi>Diaſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le)</hi> and the firſt of theſe <hi>motions</hi> is <hi>Diſtention,</hi> it is manifeſt that that action proceeds from the <hi>blood;</hi> but the <hi>Contraction</hi> is made by the <hi>Veſicula pulſans</hi> in an <hi>Egge,</hi> (as by the <hi>Heart</hi> in a <hi>Chicken)</hi> by its proper <hi>fibres;</hi> as by an <hi>Organ</hi> deſtined to that uſe.
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:56144:161"/>
And it is alſo certain, that the ſaid <hi>Veſicula,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Auricula cordis,</hi> the <hi>deaf-eare</hi> of the <hi>Heart,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards (from whom the <hi>Pulſation</hi> firſt begins) are incited to the <hi>conſtrictive motion,</hi> by the <hi>blood</hi> diſtending them. The <hi>Diaſtole,</hi> or <hi>Dilatation,</hi> is made by the <hi>blood</hi> boyling or ſwelling by the <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> within it: And ſo <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Opinion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>pulſation</hi> of the <hi>Heart,</hi> (namely, that it is made by a kinde of <hi>Ebullition)</hi> is in ſome ſort true. For as in <hi>Milk</hi> ſet upon the <hi>fire,</hi> and in <hi>Beere,</hi> we ſee dayly a <hi>Fermentation,</hi> working, or Intume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence; ſo is it in the <hi>pulſe</hi> of the <hi>Heart,</hi> in which the <hi>blood,</hi> as by a kinde of <hi>fermentation</hi> working up, is <hi>diſtended,</hi> and then ebbs, or falls down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: and that which befalls them <hi>per accidens,</hi> from an <hi>external agent</hi> (namely, an <hi>adventitious heat)</hi> that is accompliſhed in the <hi>blood,</hi> by its own <hi>internal heat,</hi> or <hi>innate ſpirit;</hi> and is alſo regulated by the <hi>ſoul</hi> in a natural way, and for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>living creatures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Pulſe</hi> therefore is performed by a twofold <hi>Agent;</hi> namely, the <hi>Diſtention</hi> or <hi>Dilatation</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the <hi>Blood;</hi> and the <hi>Conſtriction,</hi> from the <hi>membrane</hi> of the <hi>veſicula</hi> in the <hi>Egge;</hi> (but in the <hi>Foetus</hi> when it is born, from the <hi>Deaf-eares,</hi> and <hi>Ventricles</hi> of the <hi>Heart)</hi> and by the mutual perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this alternate and interchanging <hi>motion,</hi> the <hi>blood</hi> is driven round the whole <hi>body,</hi> and ſo our lives continued.</p>
            <p>Nor is the <hi>Blood</hi> therefore onely to be called the <hi>Primigenial</hi> and <hi>principal part,</hi> becauſe that in, and from it the fountain of <hi>motion</hi> and <hi>pulſation</hi> is derived; but alſo, becauſe the <hi>Animal heat,</hi> or <hi>vital ſpirit</hi> is firſt radicated and implanted, and the <hi>ſoul</hi> takes up her firſt manſion in it. For whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the immediate and <hi>principal Inſtrument</hi> of the

               <hi>vegetative faculty</hi> is firſt found, there in probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity the <hi>ſoul</hi> firſt reſides, and takes her Beginning; as being inſeparable from the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and the <hi>cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum innatum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For however <hi>in Artificial Operations</hi> (as <hi>Fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> rightly admoniſheth) <hi>the Artificer and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments</hi>

               <hi>are ſeparated; yet in the works of Nature they are conjoyned, and one and the ſame: ſo the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack is both the Author, and the Inſtrument of chylifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> So in like manner, the <hi>Soul</hi> with the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> (her <hi>Inſtrument)</hi> is immediately conjoyned: and therefore be it in what <hi>part</hi> it will, that <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>motion</hi> firſt begin, there alſo the <hi>Life</hi> doth firſt ariſe, and laſt expire; and out of queſtion, the moſt intimate domeſtick <hi>Deities,</hi> and <hi>Soul</hi> it ſelfe, are there enſhrined.</p>
            <p>

For I have experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the <hi>diſſection</hi> of many <hi>live Animals,</hi> that when the <hi>body</hi> was now a dying, and breathing done, the <hi>Heart</hi> continued its pulſe a while, and kept up <hi>life</hi> in it. And when the <hi>Heart</hi> hath now gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven over, you ſhall diſcern a <hi>motion</hi> yet ſurviving in the <hi>Auriculae,</hi> or <hi>Deaf-eares;</hi> and though the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faile, yet the <hi>Right</hi> will ſtill be ſtirring; and when that ſubmits to Fate too, yet you ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a kinde of <hi>undulation,</hi> or waving to and fro, and obſcure <hi>trepidation,</hi> or <hi>palpitation</hi> in the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion<hi>-blood,</hi> proclaiming that he gave the laſt blow. And any man may plainly ſee, that the <hi>blood</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines heat, (that deriver of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Palſation)</hi> when all the other <hi>parts</hi> are chilled, and cold: which heat when it is quite extinct, as the <hi>blood</hi> is then no longer <hi>ſanguis, ſed cruor, Blood,</hi> but <hi>Gore;</hi> ſo now no longer hope of returning back to <hi>liſe.</hi>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:56144:162"/>
But, both in an <hi>Egge,</hi> and in gaſping <hi>Animals,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all <hi>pulſation</hi> is expunged, if you apply a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle warmth either to the <hi>Punctum ſaliens,</hi> or the <hi>right Auricle</hi> of the <hi>Heart,</hi> you ſhall preſently ſee the <hi>motion, pulſation,</hi> and <hi>life</hi> ſet on foot again by the <hi>Blood;</hi> except he have quite fore-gone all his <hi>innate heat,</hi> and <hi>vital ſpirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By all which it is moſt evident, that the blood is the <hi>Genital Part,</hi> the fountain of Life, <hi>Primum vivens, &amp; ultimum moriens,</hi> the Firſt-born, and the Longeſt Liver, and the chief Palace and Court of the <hi>ſoul:</hi> in which (as in its Spring-head) the heat doth firſt and chiefly flow, and flouriſh: and from which all the other <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their life and influent warmth.

            <p>And therefore <hi>Blood</hi> is found in every particle of the <hi>Body,</hi> nor can you find footing for the point of a needle, or the edge of your naile, where you ſhall not immediately ſtart the blood: as if, were it not for the <hi>blood,</hi> the body would enjoy no heat, nor life. Therefore the <hi>blood</hi> being never ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle concentrated and fixt, <hi>(Hippocrates</hi> calls it, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>And hereupon the ruddy ſanguine parts alone,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:56144:162"/>

            <p>The Heart himſelfe, I ſay, doth by the <hi>Coronary Arteries</hi> receive the Blood, its influent <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> both which it enjoyes upon no other account, then the meer bounty of the <hi>Blood.</hi> Nor can the <hi>Liver</hi> proceed in its <hi>publick office,</hi> without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of <hi>blood</hi> and <hi>heat</hi> from the <hi>Coeliacal Artery.</hi> For there is no where any affluence of <hi>heat,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Influence or influx of <hi>blood</hi> by the <hi>Arteries.</hi> And therefore in the firſt Confirmation of all the <hi>parts,</hi> before they put themſelves into publick un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, they are to be diſcovered <hi>pale,</hi> and <hi>blood-leſſe:</hi> hereupon the old <hi>Phyſitians</hi> and <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomiſts</hi> ſuppoſed them to be <hi>ſpermatical parts,</hi> and this ſpeech was wont to obtain amongſt them, that in Generation, <hi>Aliquot in Lacte dies abſumun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> ſome daies are ſpent in the <hi>Milk,</hi> that is about the Conſtitution of the <hi>white; Spermatical parts.</hi> The very ſubſtance of the <hi>Liver</hi> it ſelf, the Lungs, and the Heart, at their firſt appearance are excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>white.</hi> Nay the <hi>Cone</hi> of the <hi>Heart,</hi> and the <hi>walls</hi> or <hi>ſides</hi> of its <hi>Ventricles,</hi> are even then <hi>white,</hi> when the <hi>Auriculae</hi> are full, and dyed with <hi>Scarlet-blood,</hi> and the <hi>Coronary Vein</hi> looks ruddy.

            <p>And laſtly, the <hi>blood</hi> doth ſo ſurround, and peirce into the whole <hi>body,</hi> and impart <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>life</hi> to all its <hi>parts,</hi> that the <hi>ſoul</hi> may juſtly be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted reſident in it, and for his ſake, <hi>Tota in tota &amp; tota in qualibet parte,</hi> to be all in <hi>all,</hi> and all in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>part,</hi> (as the old ſaying is.)</p>
            <p>But it is ſo far from truth (which yet <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and all <hi>Phyſitians</hi> affirm) that the <hi>Liver,</hi> or <hi>Heart</hi> is the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Blood:</hi> that the contrary, out of the <hi>fabrick</hi> of the <hi>chicken</hi> in the <hi>egge,</hi> is moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt: namely, the <hi>Blood</hi> rather is the Author of the <hi>Heart,</hi> and <hi>Liver.</hi> And this alſo <hi>Phyſitians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are aware ſeem to acknowledge, while they conclude that the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the <hi>Liver</hi> is a certain affuſion, or conflux of <hi>Blood:</hi> as if it were nothing elſe but <hi>blood</hi> congealed. Now it muſt have a being before it can be affuſed, or coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and that it is ſo, <hi>experience</hi> her ſelf openly diſplayes; for <hi>blood</hi> appears in the <hi>egg,</hi> before there be any <hi>track</hi> or <hi>Rudiment</hi> of any ſuch thing as the <hi>Body,</hi> or any of the <hi>Viſcera.</hi> And yet no <hi>blood</hi> can come thither from the <hi>Mother</hi> to the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> (as people commonly phanſie in <hi>Viviparous productions.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Liver</hi> of <hi>Fiſhes</hi> is alwaies <hi>whitiſh,</hi> though their <hi>Veins</hi> are purpled, and dark. And our Hens the better they are crammed, ſo much the more do their <hi>Livers</hi> impair, and grow pallid. <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſickneſs Virgins</hi> that are <hi>Cachectical,</hi> as the <hi>habit</hi> of their <hi>bodies</hi> is pale, ſo is their <hi>Liver:</hi> an evident ſigne of the penury and dearth of <hi>Blood.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Liver</hi> borrows his <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>complexion</hi> from the <hi>blood,</hi> and not the <hi>blood</hi> from him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:56144:163"/>
Hence it is plaine, that <hi>blood</hi> is the <hi>prime geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Part,</hi> whence the <hi>ſoul</hi> primarily reſults, and out of which the <hi>primary animate part</hi> of the <hi>Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> which is the fountain of all the reſt, both <hi>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar,</hi> and <hi>diſſimilar</hi> is derived, which by that means attain their <hi>Vital heat,</hi> and become ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to it: And the <hi>Heart</hi> is erected for this end and purpoſe onely, that it may by continual <hi>pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation</hi> (to which the <hi>Veins</hi> and <hi>Arteries</hi> are mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial and ſubſervient) entertain this <hi>blood,</hi> and ſpout it out again up and down through the whole <hi>body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which is the clearer diſcovered by this, that the <hi>Heart</hi> hath not a <hi>pulſation</hi> in all <hi>Animals,</hi> nor yet at all times; when yet the <hi>blood,</hi> or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing proportionable to <hi>blood</hi> is never wanting in any.</p>

               <hi>the Stars,</hi> and that it was the <hi>Creators Vice-Roy:</hi> If ſome of the <hi>Moderns</hi> ſay, that the ſeed of <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals</hi> ejected in <hi>Coition</hi> is <hi>animate,</hi> Why ſhould we not upon as good reaſon ſay, that there is a ſoul in the <hi>Blood?</hi> and ſeeing it is the firſt begotten, firſt moved, &amp; firſt nouriſhed, why ſhould we doubt to affirm, that the <hi>ſoul</hi> is firſt raiſed, &amp; kindled out of it? <hi>Blood</hi> is that, wherein the <hi>Vegetal</hi> and <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſative operations</hi> firſt ſhine forth: in which the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary and immediate officer of the ſoul, is bred; which is the common tye of <hi>ſoul</hi> and <hi>body;</hi> and in which, as in her <hi>Chariot,</hi> the <hi>ſoul</hi> viſits and ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth influence upon all the parts of the body.</p>
            <p>Beſides, ſince the contemplation of <hi>Geniture</hi> is (as we have ſeen already) ſo difficult, (namely, how the <hi>fabrick</hi> of the <hi>body</hi> ſhould be built by it, with providence, art, and divine underſtanding) why ſhould we not by the ſame right, admire the excellent nature of <hi>blood,</hi> and harbour as worthy thoughts concerning it, as <hi>ſeed?</hi> eſpecially ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Geniture</hi> it ſelf (as appears by the <hi>egge)</hi> is made of the <hi>blood;</hi> and all the whole <hi>body</hi> (as from its <hi>Genital part)</hi> ſeems not onely to deſume its firſt Foundation, but Preſervation alſo, from it.</p>
            <p>Thus much by the way concerning this matter, being to treat more fully and exactly of it elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. Nor do I conceive it worth the trouble, to diſpute here, whether the definition of a <hi>part</hi> in its proper acceptation agree to <hi>blood?</hi> which ſome deny upon theſe grounds chiefly, becauſe it hath not <hi>ſenſe,</hi> and becauſe it flowes and inſinuates in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>body,</hi> to cater convenient dyet for them. But I have found many things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the manner of Generation, by which being convinced, I ſhall eſtabliſh the contrary to thoſe things, (which <hi>Philoſophers &amp; Phyſitians</hi> common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:56144:165"/>
affirm, or deny.) At preſent I will onely ſay, that in caſe we ſhould conſent that the <hi>blood</hi> hath not <hi>ſenſe,</hi> yet it cannot be thence inferred, that it is no part of the <hi>ſenſitive body,</hi> and that the chifeſt too. For neither the <hi>Braine,</hi> nor the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Marrow,</hi> or the <hi>Cryſtalline,</hi> or <hi>Glaſſie humour</hi> of the <hi>Eye</hi> have any <hi>ſenſe,</hi> and yet all <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and <hi>Phyſitians</hi> do to this day with one conſent, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them to be <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>body.</hi> But <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> did number it amongſt the <hi>ſimilar parts,</hi> and <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> alſo; for while he conſtitutes the <hi>Animal body,</hi> out of <hi>conteining,</hi> and <hi>conteined parts,</hi> and <hi>impetum facientibus, ſpirits,</hi> he did neceſſarily own the <hi>blood</hi> amongſt the <hi>conteined parts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But of this more at large, when we enquire what a <hi>part</hi> is, and how many ſeveral acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons there are of it. In the mean time, we will not conceale this Admirable <hi>Experiment</hi> (by which it ſhall appear that the moſt principal member of all, namely, the very <hi>Heart</hi> it ſelf, may ſeem to be inſenſible.)</p>
            <p>A <hi>Noble</hi> young Gentleman, <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Heire</hi> to the honorable the <hi>Vice-Count</hi> of <hi>Mountgomery</hi> in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> when he was a <hi>childe,</hi> had a ſtrange miſhapp by an unexpected <hi>fall,</hi> cauſing a <hi>Fracture</hi> in the <hi>Ribs</hi> on the <hi>left ſide:</hi> the <hi>Bruiſe</hi> was brought to a <hi>Suppuration,</hi> whereby a great quantity of putrified matter was voided out, and this putrefaction guſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out for a long while together out of the wide wound. I deliver it from his own mouth, and the teſtimony of other <hi>creditable</hi> perſons, who were <hi>eye-witneſſes.</hi> This perſon of Honour, about the eighteenth, or nineteenth year of his <hi>Age,</hi> having been a <hi>Traveller</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> arrived at laſt at <hi>London:</hi> having all this time a very wide gap open in his <hi>Breaſt,</hi> ſo that you might ſee and touch
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:56144:166"/>
his <hi>Lungs</hi> (as it was believed.) Which, when it came to the late King <hi>Charles</hi> his ear, being related as a <hi>miracle, He</hi> preſently ſent me to the Young Gentleman, to inform <hi>Him,</hi> how the matter ſtood. Well, what happened? When I came neer him, and ſaw him a ſprightly Youth, with a good <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,</hi> and <hi>habit</hi> of <hi>body,</hi> I ſuppoſed, ſome body or other had framed an untruth. But having ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted him, as the manner is, and declared unto him the Cauſe of my <hi>Viſit,</hi> by the <hi>Kings Command,</hi> he diſcovered all to me, and opened the void part of his <hi>left ſide,</hi> taking off that ſmall <hi>plate,</hi> which he wore to defend it againſt any blow or outward injury. Where I preſently beheld a vaſt <hi>hole</hi> in his <hi>breaſt,</hi> into which I could eaſily put my three Fore-fingers, and my Thumb; and at the firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance I perceived a certain <hi>fleſhy part</hi> ſticking out, which was driven in and out by a reciprocal <hi>moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> whereupon I gently handled it in my hand. Being now amazed at the novelty of the thing, I ſearch it again and again, and having diligently enough enquired into all, it was evident, that that old and vaſt <hi>Ulcer</hi> (for want of the help of a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Phyſitian)</hi> was miraculouſly healed, and skin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned over with a membrane on the <hi>Inſide,</hi> and guarded with <hi>fleſh</hi> all about the brimmes or mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of it. But that <hi>fleſhy ſubſtance</hi> (which at the firſt ſight I conceived to be <hi>proud fleſh,</hi> and every body elſe took to be a <hi>lobe</hi> of the <hi>Lungs)</hi> by its <hi>pulſe,</hi> and the differences or <hi>rythme</hi> thereof, or the time which it kept, (and laying one hand upon his <hi>wreſt,</hi> and the other upon his <hi>heart)</hi> and alſo by comparing and conſidering his <hi>Reſpirations,</hi> I concluded it to be no part of the <hi>Lungs,</hi> but the <hi>Cone</hi> or <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the <hi>Heart;</hi> which an excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent fungous <hi>Subſtance</hi> (as is uſual in ſoul <hi>Ulcers)</hi>
               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:56144:166"/>
had fenced outwardly like a Sconce. The Young Gentlemans <hi>Man</hi> did by dayly warm injections deliver that fleſhy accretion from the filth &amp; pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions which grew about it, and ſo clapt on the <hi>Plate:</hi> which was no ſooner done, but his <hi>Maſter</hi> was well, and ready for any <hi>journey</hi> or <hi>exerciſe,</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a pleaſant, and ſecure <hi>life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, inſtead of an <hi>Account</hi> of the <hi>Buſineſſ,</hi> I brought the Young Gentleman himſelf to our late <hi>King,</hi> that he might ſee, and handle this ſtrange and ſingular Accident with his own <hi>Senſes;</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>Heart</hi> and its <hi>Ventricles</hi> in their own <hi>pulſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> in a young, and ſprigtly Gentleman, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offenſe to him: Whereupon the <hi>King</hi> himſelf conſented with me, That the <hi>Heart</hi> is deprived of the <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Feeling.</hi> For the Party perceived not that we touched him at all, but meerly by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, or by the <hi>ſenſation</hi> of the outward <hi>skin.</hi> We likewiſe took notice of the <hi>motion</hi> of his <hi>Heart;</hi> namely, that in the <hi>Diaſtole</hi> it was drawn in and retracted, and in the <hi>Syſtole</hi> came forth, and was thruſt out; and that the <hi>Syſtole</hi> was made in the <hi>heart,</hi> when the <hi>Diaſtole</hi> was ſenſible in the <hi>wreſt;</hi> and alſo that the proper <hi>motion</hi> of the <hi>heart</hi> is the <hi>Syſtole;</hi> and laſtly, that the <hi>heart</hi> then beats upon the <hi>breaſt,</hi> and is a litle prominent, when it is lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upwards and contracted into it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Nor is that other Controverſie (namely, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Blood</hi> do onely ſerve to nouriſh the <hi>Body)</hi> to be much inſiſted upon in this place. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> indeed doth in ſeveral places contend, that the <hi>blood</hi> is <hi>Alimentum ultimum,</hi> the laſt Aliment, and with him the whole School of <hi>Phyſitians</hi> give ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage. And yet many things hard to be unfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and of bad coherence, will enſue upon that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.

               <hi>ſtotle,</hi> did conſtitute the <hi>blood</hi> out of parts and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in ſome manner alike. <hi>Phyſitians</hi> indeed do onely take notice of humane blood, and of that as it ſpins into a Sawcer in <hi>Phlebotomy,</hi> and ſo coagulates. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> contemplates the <hi>blood</hi> of all creatures in general, or that which beareth an Analogy with <hi>blood.</hi> But laying aſide all cavil, and omitting the inconveniences which do pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue their opinion, I ſhall briefly touch upon thoſe things, which they both conſent in, and are plainly diſcovered by ſenſe it ſelf, and are more pertinent to our buſineſs: intending elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where to examine them at large.</p>
            <p>Though (as I have informed you) the <hi>blood</hi> is called a <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>body,</hi> and that the <hi>primigenial</hi> and <hi>principal part;</hi> yet if it be conſidered in the whole <hi>lump</hi> (as it is in the <hi>Veins)</hi> nothing hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, why we may not ſay, that it conteins <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> concocts it, and doth apply it to all parts: and that being one and the ſame thing, yet in that acceptation it may be ſaid, both to <hi>feed,</hi> and to be <hi>fed,</hi> as alſo to be both the <hi>material</hi> and <hi>effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> cauſe of the <hi>Body:</hi> and naturally to have that very conſtitution, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> conceived to be neceſſary in the <hi>primigenial part;</hi> namely, that the <hi>blood</hi> is partly of a <hi>ſimilar,</hi> and partly of a <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilar</hi> conſtitution. For, ſaith he, <hi>Since for ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſake it is neceſſarily ordered, that there ſhould be ſimilar members in Animals; and ſince both the power of ſenſation, motion, and nutrition, are all comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſame member,</hi> (namely the <hi>Primogenit) it is neceſſary that that member (which conteins ſuch principles in it) ſhould both be ſimple, that it may be capable of all ſenſible objects; and alſo diſſimilar, that it may move, and act. Wherefore,</hi> he goes on, <hi>in the race of creatures that have blood, the Heart is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
               <pb n="291" facs="tcp:56144:167"/>
               <hi>ſuch a member: but in the bloodleſs, that member which is proportionable to the Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if by the <hi>Heart</hi> he underſtand that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle which is firſt ſeen in the <hi>Egge;</hi> namely, the <hi>Blood,</hi> together with its receptacles (the <hi>Veſiculae pulſantes,</hi> and the Veins) as one and the ſame <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan;</hi> I then conceive he ſpeaks moſt true: for the <hi>Blood</hi> as it is diſcovered in the <hi>Egge</hi> and the <hi>Veſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula,</hi> is partly ſimilar, and partly diſſimilar. But if he underſtand it otherwiſe, that which is ſeen in the <hi>egge,</hi> will eaſily confute him: for the ſubſtance of the <hi>Heart,</hi> being conſidered without the <hi>Blood</hi> (namely, its <hi>Cones,</hi> and the <hi>Walls</hi> or <hi>partitions</hi> of its <hi>Ventricles)</hi> is generated long after: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues ſo long white, without any irrigation of <hi>blood</hi> upon it, untill the <hi>Heart</hi> be faſhioned into an Organical form, ſuch as may ſpout the <hi>blood</hi> through the whole <hi>body.</hi> Nor doth the <hi>Heart,</hi> then, appear of a ſimilar or ſimple conſtitution (as is fit for a <hi>Primogenit part</hi> to do) but <hi>fibrous, fleſhey,</hi> and <hi>muſculous:</hi> and indeed (as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> would have it) a plain <hi>Muſcle,</hi> or Inſtrument of motion. But, the <hi>blood,</hi> (as it is firſt ſeen, and as it beats being yet comprehended in the <hi>Veſicula,)</hi> is plainly of that conſtitution, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> judgeth neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to a <hi>Principal part.</hi> For the <hi>blood,</hi> while it is in its natural conſtitution in the <hi>body,</hi> is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſimilar. But ſo ſoon as it is diſlodged, and out of its <hi>receptacles,</hi> and puts of its native heat; it preſently degenerates into ſeveral parts, as ſome diſſimilar thing.</p>
            <p>But if the <hi>blood</hi> were naturally deſigned onely to the nouriſhing of the <hi>body,</hi> it would be onely of a ſimilar conſtitution; like the <hi>Chyle,</hi> or <hi>White</hi> of an <hi>egge;</hi> or at leaſt it would be a mixt body, being compounded of the foreſaid <hi>parts</hi> or <hi>juyces,</hi>
               <pb n="292" facs="tcp:56144:168"/>
and yet truly one: as thoſe other <hi>juyces;</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>Choler</hi> and <hi>Phlegme,</hi> which after death, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when they are taken out of their habitations, remain the ſame, as when they were ſeen in the live body: but are not ſo ſoon changed.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> attributes to a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part, that very ſame thing is proper to <hi>blood.</hi> For <hi>blood,</hi> as it is a Natural body, being an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogeneous, or Diſſimilar ſubſtance, is compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of thoſe <hi>parts,</hi> or <hi>juyces.</hi> But as it lives, and it the chief Animal part, compounded of a body and ſoul. But when that ſoul, by reaſon of the expiration of the native heat, doth vaniſh, and its native ſubſtance is preſently corrupted, and is diſſolved into thoſe parts, of which it was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made: namely, firſt into a Watry Blood, next into Red, and White parts: and the Red parts, which are uppermoſt, are moſt florid: but thoſe that ſinck downwards grow dark, and black. Now ſome of the parts alſo are <hi>fibrous,</hi> and thicker, as being the tye, and connexion of the reſt; others are <hi>ichorous</hi> and <hi>ſerous,</hi> upon which the coagulated <hi>lump</hi> uſeth to float. And into this <hi>Serum</hi> almoſt all the <hi>blood</hi> degenerates. Now theſe parts are not in the live <hi>blood,</hi> but onely when it is now corrupted and diſſolved by death.</p>
            <p>Beſides the recited <hi>parts,</hi> there is ſeen in hotter and ſtronger Animals, as in Horſes, Oxen, and Men alſo of a more lively conſtitution, another part of <hi>blood,</hi> which when the <hi>blood</hi> is let out and gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mefieth, ſeating it ſelfe in the upper <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>redder blood,</hi> doth condenſe, and plainly reſemble a <hi>Gelly</hi> made of <hi>Harts-horn,</hi> or kind of <hi>Mucilage,</hi> or thicker white of an <hi>egge.</hi> The vulgar count it the <hi>Phlegme,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> the crude and unconcocted part of the <hi>blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:56144:168"/>
I have obſerved this part, to differ, as well, from the <hi>ſerous,</hi> (upon which the coagulated gore uſeth to ſwim) as from the other <hi>parts,</hi> as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe from the Urine, which is dreined by the Kidnies from the <hi>blood.</hi> Nor is it to be thought the cruder and colder part of the <hi>blood,</hi> but the more <hi>ſpirital,</hi> as I ſuppoſe, and that by two <hi>experiments;</hi> Firſt, becauſe it ſwimmes above the <hi>florid</hi> and brighter part of the <hi>blood,</hi> (which is vulgarly conceived to be the <hi>Arterial blood)</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>hotter,</hi> and fuller of <hi>ſpirits</hi> then it, and upon the diſgregation of the <hi>blood,</hi> obtaines the upper place.</p>
            <p>Alſo in <hi>breathing a Veine,</hi> this ſort of <hi>blood</hi> (where of there is plenty in perſons of a <hi>hot tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature,</hi> that are ſtrong and fleſhy) it <hi>darts</hi> it ſelf out in a longer ſtream, and more vehemency (as if it ſpirted out of a Syringe) &amp; hereupon we count it <hi>hotter,</hi> and more <hi>ſpirital:</hi> as that <hi>geniture</hi> is counted moſt fertile &amp; fraught with <hi>ſpirits,</hi> which leaps fartheſt and moſt forcibly.</p>
            <p>And that this <hi>gelly</hi> doth much differ from that <hi>ichorous</hi> and <hi>watry ſubſtance,</hi> which (as being colder then the reſt) ſinketh down to the bottom of the <hi>ſawcer,</hi> is evident for two reaſons: for the <hi>watry</hi> and <hi>waſhy</hi> part is more crude and inconcocted, then that it may be wrought up into perfect <hi>blood.</hi> But the <hi>gelly,</hi> which is thicker and more <hi>fibrous,</hi> ſwimming above the <hi>lump</hi> of <hi>blood,</hi> appeareth more concocted and elaborate then it. And therefore in the ſolution or partition of the <hi>blood,</hi> this <hi>gelly</hi> keeps aloof, the <hi>whey</hi> or <hi>ſanies</hi> loweſt, but the <hi>lump</hi> and <hi>red parts</hi> (as well the brighter as the darker) poſſeſs the <hi>middle region.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now is it moſt certain, that not onely that part, but all the <hi>blood,</hi> nay the very <hi>fleſh</hi> it ſelf (as
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:56144:169"/>
may be obſerved in <hi>Bodyes hanged</hi> in Chains) may may be corrupted into <hi>ichorous whey.</hi> As being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into that ſubſtance, of which they were firſt compounded: ſo <hi>Salt</hi> is reſolved into <hi>Lie,</hi> from whence it firſt ſprung. So likewiſe in every <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chexie,</hi> the <hi>blood</hi> that is <hi>let,</hi> abounds with plenty of <hi>Serum:</hi> ſo that ſometimes there ſcarce appears any <hi>grumous part</hi> at all, but all the <hi>blood</hi> ſeems to be one entire <hi>waſhy gore;</hi> as we finde in that kinde of <hi>Dropſie</hi> called <hi>Anaſarca:</hi> and it is alſo natural in creatures that are <hi>bloodleſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Likewiſe, if you breath a <hi>veine</hi> immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you have eat and drank, (before the ſecond concoction be finiſhed, and the <hi>Serum</hi> deſcended through the <hi>Kidnies)</hi> or upon the firſt approach of a <hi>fit</hi> of an <hi>Ague,</hi> you ſhall finde the <hi>blood</hi> to be <hi>waſhy,</hi> inconcocted, and mingled with much <hi>whey.</hi> But on the contrary, if upon an empty Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, or diſcharge of the Urine, or a large Sweat, you open a <hi>Veine,</hi> you ſhall finde the <hi>blood</hi> thick (as being quite deſtitute of <hi>Serum)</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almoſt all condenſed into a <hi>lump.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as when the <hi>blood</hi> growes raw and crude, you ſhall perceive but very litle of this <hi>gelly</hi> float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a top. So if you poure out the <hi>Serum</hi> ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the <hi>lump</hi> or <hi>maſs,</hi> and let it ſimper upon a gentle <hi>fire,</hi> you ſhall ſoon ſee it changed into this <hi>gelly:</hi> which is a manifeſt ſigne, that that <hi>waſhy</hi> or <hi>ſerous ſubſtance,</hi> which is now divided from the reſt of the <hi>blood,</hi> is perhaps ſome matter of the <hi>Urine,</hi> but not the <hi>Urine</hi> it ſelf, though in colour and conſiſtence it look like it. For the <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi> being boyled, is not thickned into a <hi>fibrous Gelly,</hi> but rather into a <hi>Lie:</hi> but this <hi>waſhy</hi> or <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous part</hi> being a while gently <hi>heated,</hi> condenſeth into a <hi>gelly</hi> like that above: as on the contrary,

that <hi>

            </p>
            <p>And thus farre have I brought this part of the <hi>blood</hi> (which is my own <hi>Obſervation)</hi> upon the Stage; of which (and the other parts of <hi>blood,</hi> which are apparent to <hi>ſenſe,</hi> and allowed by the authority of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and <hi>Phyſitians)</hi> I ſhall more copiouſly diſcourſe hereafter.</p>
            <p>In this place, not to digreſs farther, I conceive the <hi>blood</hi> to be taken (with <hi>Ariſtotle)</hi> not as it is <note place="margin">

               <hi>ſimply</hi> underſtood, and called <hi>Cruor,</hi> but as it is a living part of an <hi>Animal body.</hi> For ſo <hi>Ariſtotle: The blood is hot in ſuch a ſenſe, as if we could call hot water by one onely word, and not as a ſubject receiving heat into it. For heat is in the eſſence of the blood; as whiteneſs, in a white man. But when blood is made hot by any diſtemper, or paſſion of the Minde, it is not then</hi> calidus perſe, <hi>hot, by its own heat. And thus we may ſay of that which is moiſt, or dry. Wherefore, partly a hot, and partly a moiſt ſubſtance is in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſuch kinde of things; but if you divide them, they then grow cold, and congeale; and ſuch is blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Blood</hi> therefore as it is a <hi>living part</hi> of the Body, is of a doubtfull nature, and falls under a two fold conſideration. And therefore <hi>materialiter &amp; per ſe,</hi> it is called nutriment; but <hi>formaliter,</hi> as it is endued with <hi>heat,</hi> and <hi>ſpirits,</hi> (which are the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate <hi>inſtruments</hi> of the <hi>Soul)</hi> and with the <hi>Soul</hi> it ſelf: it is to be counted the Bodies <hi>Genius,</hi> and <hi>Conſerver,</hi> the <hi>Principal, Primogenit,</hi> and <hi>Genital part.</hi> And as a <hi>Prolifical egg</hi> is the <hi>Matter, Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and <hi>Efficient cauſe</hi> of the <hi>Chicken,</hi> and as all <hi>Phyſitians</hi> count the <hi>geniture</hi> of both <hi>Sexes</hi> mingled in the <hi>womb</hi> after <hi>coition,</hi> both for the <hi>material</hi> and <hi>efficient</hi> of the <hi>Foetus;</hi> ſo, upon a better right, may we affirm, That the <hi>Blood</hi> is both the <hi>Matter</hi> and
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:56144:170"/>
               <hi>Preſerver</hi> of the Body, and not the <hi>bare Aliment.</hi> For it is a known thing in <hi>Creatures</hi> that are <hi>ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> by <hi>hunger,</hi> and <hi>Men</hi> alſo that dye of <hi>Conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> that a great quantity of <hi>blood</hi> remains in their <hi>Veins</hi> even after death. And alſo <hi>Young</hi> men that are in their growth, and <hi>Old</hi> men that are decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, have a proportionable quantity of <hi>blood;</hi> namely, according to the increaſe, or diminution of their <hi>Fleſh.</hi> So that the <hi>blood</hi> is a <hi>part,</hi> and not the <hi>nutriment</hi> onely of the Body.

            <p>But while I affirm the <hi>ſoul</hi> to reſide firſt, and principally in the <hi>blood,</hi> I would not have any man haſtily to conclude from hence, that all <hi>Blood-letting</hi> is dangerous, or hurtfull; or believe with the Vulgar, that as much of <hi>blood,</hi> ſo much of <hi>life</hi> is taken away, becauſe <hi>Holy-writ</hi> placeth the <hi>life</hi> in the <hi>blood.</hi> For dayly experience ſhewes, that <hi>Letting blood</hi> is a ſafe cure for ſeveral <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> and the chiefeſt of Univerſal <hi>Remedies:</hi> becauſe the default, or ſuperfluity of the <hi>blood</hi> is the ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary of moſt <hi>diſtempers;</hi> and a ſeaſonable evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, doth often reſcue men from moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate maladies, and Death it ſelf.

            <p>It is therefore a clear caſe, that the Chicken newly <hi>hatched,</hi> (while it is yet weak and tender) is nouriſhed by the <hi>yolk.</hi> And as while he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within the <hi>Egge,</hi> he was partly fed by the <hi>yolke,</hi> and partly by the <hi>whites,</hi> but chiefly by the hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the <hi>whites,</hi> which as they are in greater quantity, ſo are they ſooner exhauſted: ſo in like manner, when he is now <hi>hatched,</hi> (at which time all his <hi>aliment</hi> paſſeth through his <hi>Liver,</hi> and there receives a farther preparation) he is nouriſhed partly by the <hi>yolk</hi> attracted from the Guts, and partly by the <hi>Chyle,</hi> which the ſeveral propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Meſeraick Veines</hi> ſuck into themſelves; when there is in the <hi>yolk</hi> onely one propagation of the <hi>Vena Porta</hi> diſtributed into it, and a litle onely of the <hi>yolk</hi> remaining. For <hi>Nature,</hi> as <hi>Nurſes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to wean their <hi>Infants</hi> by degrees, gives them other meats ſometimes, that ſo they may the better endure the decay of the <hi>milk:</hi> ſo the <hi>Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi> is trained by degrees, from <hi>meat</hi> of <hi>eaſier con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction,</hi> to <hi>harder</hi> (as from the <hi>Yolk,</hi> to the <hi>Chyle.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore what we ſee of the <hi>propagation</hi> of the <hi>Veines</hi> in the <hi>Egge,</hi> is done upon exceeding good grounds. For as ſoon as the <hi>Chicken</hi> begins firſt to be modelled, the <hi>Veines</hi> are then extended only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:56144:172"/>
the <hi>Colliquamentum;</hi> by which the <hi>blood</hi> being fed and grown, adjoyns the reſt of the <hi>body</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to be brought up with him. Afterwards, the veines reach into the thinner <hi>white,</hi> from whence the Chicken receiveth his ſuſtenance, (while he yet reſembleth a <hi>Gelly,</hi> or <hi>Mucilage,</hi> and a <hi>Maggot)</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they ſpread into the <hi>thicker White,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non into the <hi>Yolk,</hi> that by that alſo it may be entertained; and being as yet but tender, it is fed in part by the <hi>yolk</hi> (as by <hi>milke)</hi> hoarded up in the <hi>abdomen,</hi> and in part by <hi>food</hi> provided and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the <hi>Hen,</hi> till it be able to ſeek abroad for nouriſhment convenient, and can digeſt it. So that through the whole <hi>ſeries</hi> of Generation, <hi>Nature</hi> hath moſt prudently conſidered of various Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proportionable to the various abilities of the <hi>Digeſtive faculty</hi> of the future <hi>Foetus.</hi> For while it is yet <hi>feeble,</hi> ſhe hath provided it milder diet, and ſolider meats for its <hi>ſtronger</hi> capacity: and when it is now <hi>hearty</hi> enough, and can away with courſer cates, it is ſerved with commons an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to it. And hereupon I conceive, that <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect eggs</hi> are not onely <hi>party-coloured,</hi> but alſo fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with a <hi>double White.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what we have found out by <hi>Experience,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>De gen. an. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note> ſeems alſo to agree with <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> opinion, where he ſaith, <hi>That Part of it which is hotter, comes neerer the form deſigned to the inſtitution of the members, but that which is earthier, yeelds matter to frame the body, and is more unlike. As in party-coloured eggs, the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal aſſumes the Rudiments of its generation from the White, (for the animals beginning is in the hot part) and its aliment from the yolk. Therefore in hotter ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, thoſe two are reſerved apart; namely, that from whence they take the beginning of their being, and that</hi>
               <pb n="302" facs="tcp:56144:173"/>
               <hi>from whence they derive their aliment, and one of them is white, and the other yellow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It appeares by what hath been ſaid, that the <hi>Chicken</hi> (and the ſame thing ſhall afterwards be demonſtrated of all <hi>conceptions)</hi> as he reſults, or is framed from the <hi>implanted principle,</hi> or <hi>ſoul</hi> of the <hi>egge,</hi> ſo he alſo obtaines his nouriſhment from the <hi>Egge</hi> too: wherefore he hath no need of a <hi>mother,</hi> as the <hi>Plants</hi> have of the <hi>Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is no truer of him, that he is <hi>nouriſhed</hi> by his <hi>mothers blood,</hi> or <hi>lives</hi> by her <hi>ſpirits;</hi> and ſo his own <hi>heart</hi> lies fallow and idle the while, then that he <hi>moves</hi> and <hi>perceives</hi> by his <hi>mothers organs,</hi> or is enlivened and takes growth from her <hi>ſoul.</hi> But the caſe is plain, and all men acknowledge, that the <hi>Foetus</hi> is fed by the <hi>Umbilical Veſſels;</hi> and that the <hi>Venal branches</hi> diſſeminated into the <hi>White</hi> and <hi>Yolk,</hi> do hence derive ſuſtenance, which they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to the <hi>Foetus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is likewiſe clear, that when the <hi>Chicken</hi> is now <hi>hatcht,</hi> or <hi>excluded,</hi> he is ſupplyed with proviſions, partly from the <hi>Yolk,</hi> and partly from the <hi>Chyle;</hi> and that they both paſs into the <hi>Liver</hi> by the ſame <hi>Vena Porta,</hi> though by ſeveral <hi>branches</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>It is alſo clear, (to ſpeak by the way) that the <hi>Chyle</hi> which nouriſheth all <hi>living creatures,</hi> is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the <hi>Meſeraick Veins</hi> out of the <hi>Guts;</hi> and that there is no need to ſearch out new wayes (namely the <hi>Venae Lacteae)</hi> or to fanſie any other paſſage in <hi>grown bodies,</hi> beſides what we finde in the <hi>Egge</hi> and <hi>Chicken.</hi> But as for the Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of that invention, we ſhall elſewhere diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, by the conſtitution of the <hi>Umbilical Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels</hi> in the <hi>Egge,</hi> (whereof we have declared ſome
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:56144:173"/>
to be <hi>Veines,</hi> and ſome <hi>Arteries)</hi> we may tollect a <hi>Circulation of the Blood,</hi> (ſuch as we have long ſince demonſtrated in our Book, <hi>de Motu Sanguin is in Animalibus)</hi> and that for <hi>vegetation, nutrition,</hi> and <hi>augmentation</hi> ſake: and therefore the <hi>Umbilical Veſſels</hi> are diſſeminated into both the <hi>Liquors,</hi> that they may lead ſuſtenance from them to the <hi>foetus;</hi> and the <hi>Arteries</hi> are derived thither too, that by a plentifull affluence of <hi>heat</hi> they may <hi>concoct, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve,</hi> and render the aliment uſefull to <hi>nutrition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And hence it comes to paſs, that whereſoever the <hi>veines</hi> (and under that name the <hi>Arteries</hi> alſo are here comprehended) do arrive to the ſubſtance of the <hi>White</hi> or <hi>Yolk,</hi> thoſe parts ſeem to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and put on a different look or appearance from the reſt. For ſo ſoon as ever the <hi>branches</hi> of the <hi>Veines</hi> ſhoot forth, the ſuperiour or exteriour part of the <hi>White</hi> (into which they are inſerted) grows tranſparent, and melts into a <hi>Colliquntion;</hi> but the inferiour part remaining ſtill thick, and compact, is confined to the <hi>Lower angle</hi> of the Egge. So likewiſe there ſeem to be two parts (a <hi>ſuperiour</hi> and an <hi>inferiour)</hi> of the <hi>Yolk,</hi> which do as much differ from one another, as <hi>melted</hi> from <hi>unmelted wax;</hi> namely, that part which hath entertained <hi>Veines</hi> into it, from the other which is yet deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute.</p>
            <p>Hence alſo we are acquainted with the <hi>Exordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> and firſt inherent <hi>principle</hi> of the <hi>Egge.</hi> For it is clear, that the <hi>Cicatricula</hi> or <hi>Speck,</hi> is the <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal particle</hi> of the <hi>Egge,</hi> to which all the reſt are to be referred, and to which (if to any part before another) whatſoever it be, which makes the Egge <hi>prolifical,</hi> is to be imputed, as alſo the firſt <hi>onſet</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>generation</hi> of the <hi>Chicken.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as we have ſhewed) preſently after the <hi>Incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation</hi>

For indeed every <hi>Effect</hi> is a cleare teſtimony of its <hi>Efficient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word, upon the <hi>Cicatricula</hi> (wherein the firſt twy-light of <hi>native heat</hi> doth dawn) the whole <hi>Generation</hi> doth depend: Upon the <hi>Heart,</hi> the whole <hi>Chicken,</hi> and upon the <hi>Umbilical Veſſels,</hi> all the <hi>Membranes</hi> involving the <hi>Foetus</hi> (which we call the <hi>Secundine)</hi> do rely. Wherefore we conclude, that the parts of the <hi>Foetus</hi> are in <hi>ſubordination</hi> one to the other, and do firſt borrow <hi>life</hi> from the <hi>Heart.</hi>

               <hi>Fabricius</hi> (whoſe ſteps we trace in the Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Pullus)</hi> ere he proceed to the <hi>order</hi> of the <hi>Parts,</hi> doth firſt recite the <hi>actions</hi> diſcovered in an <hi>Egge,</hi> and by whoſe aſſiſtance the <hi>Parts</hi> are formed; repeating alſo in <hi>order</hi> their <hi>Faculties:</hi> as if out of them the <hi>order</hi> alſo of the Generation of the Parts may be more clearly diſcovered. <hi>There are three actions,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>which appear firſt in an Egge upon which the Hen ſits: the</hi> firſt <hi>is, the Generation of the Chicken; the</hi> ſecond, <hi>its Growth; the</hi> third, <hi>its Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition. The</hi> firſt, <hi>that is, the Generation, is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per action of the Egge; the</hi> ſecond <hi>and</hi> third <hi>(name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accretion and nutrition) do for the greateſt part come to a height out of the egge; yet they are begun in the egge, and perfected there too. Which actions, as they flow from three faculties, (the Generative, Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative, &amp; Nutritive) ſo three Effects do enſue upon them: For from generation do all the parts of the Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken reſult; from accretion and nutrition, Growth, and Increaſe: treating firſt of the Generation of the Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, we may diſcover, that by the help of Generation the parts of the Chicken (which were not before) are produced, and ſo the Egge is transformed into the body of the Chicken. Now while any part doth commigrate into another, it muſt needs paſs through a commutation of its own proper eſſence; (for otherwiſe it muſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the ſame thing ſtill) and alſo muſt be faſhioned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a figure, ſcite, and magnitude convenient and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with its nature: and in theſe two things is the Procreation of a ſubſtance abſolved, namely, Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and Conformation; therefore the Immutative and Formative faculties, are the cauſes of theſe functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Whereof the One hath produced each particular part of the body, juſt as we ſee it, out of the</hi> Chalaza <hi>of the Egge; the Other conferred the figure, ſcite, and compoſition convenient for all the ſeveral uſes of it.</hi>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:56144:175"/>
               <hi>The firſt of theſe Faculties, which is the Immutative or Alterative faculty, is wholly natural, and doth act with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any knowledge at all; and taking to it ſelf, the hot, the cold, the moiſt, and the dry parts, it alters the whole ſubance of the</hi> Chalaza <hi>throughout, and by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, it doth change it into the parts of the Chicken; that is to ſay, into Fleſh, Bones, Griſtles, Ligaments, Veines, Arteries, Nerves, and into all the other ſimilar and ſimple parts of the Animal, or Chicken: and the Cocks ſeed doth by its proper ingenit heat and ſpirit, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, create, and produce them out of the Egge (that is, the</hi> Chalaza) <hi>by Alteration and Commutation; imparting to every one of them its proper ſubſtance, and the proprieties belonging to that ſubſtance. The Other faculty which is called Formative, and which makes the ſimilar parts diſſimilar (beſtowing their beauty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, from convenient figure, juſt dimenſion, proper ſcite, and competent number) being much more noble then the former, and full of incomparable wiſdom, doth not act Naturally, but by Election or Choice, Knowledg, and Underſtanding. For truly this Formative faculty ſeems to be ſtored with moſt exact knowledg, and prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, both of the future Action, and alſo of the Uſe of every particular Part, and Organ. And thus of the firſt Action of the Egge, which is the generation of the Chicken, to whoſe celebration, both the ſeed of the Cock, as Agent, and Fructifier, and the</hi> Chalaza, <hi>is required, as the ſubject Matter. Next comes Accreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is done by Nutrition; whoſe Faculties are the Attractive, the Retentive, the Digeſtive, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive faculties: and laſtly, the Faculty of Appoſition, Agglutination, and Aſſimulation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as for this diſtribution of the Actions, I conceive it neither to be right, nor uſeful, nor pertinent in this place. Not <hi>Right;</hi> becauſe thoſe actions, which he ſeems to hold to be diſtinct, in
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:56144:175"/>
their ſpecies, and time; namely that the parts ſhould be firſt made ſimilar, by the <hi>Immutative faculty;</hi> after that, formed, and made <hi>Organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> by the formative; and then <hi>augmented</hi> by the augmentative) do no where appear ſo in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the Chicken; for the parts are all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, diſtinguiſhed, and augmented together. For though it be otherwiſe in the Generation of thoſe Animals which are framed by a <hi>Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſis;</hi> where all the parts are transformed, and lineated out of a <hi>pre-exiſtent matter,</hi> which is large enough, and prepared before hand, (as when out of a Worme is made a Butterfly, and out of another Worme a Silk-Worme) yet in Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by <hi>Epigeneſis,</hi> the buſineſs is much otherwiſe, nor is the proceeding there, as it is in <hi>Nutrition,</hi> which is performed by the divers <hi>actions</hi> of diverſe <hi>parts,</hi> joining their confederate forces and helps together: namely, where the Aliment is firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted and retained; then concocted, then diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, and at laſt agglutinated. Nor is the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar conſtitution produced by the <hi>Alterative</hi> facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, without all kind of providence (as <hi>Fabricius</hi> would have it) And the <hi>Organical,</hi> by the <hi>Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> which imployes knowledge and providence in her undertakings. For Generation and Accre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are not made without Nutrition, nor Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, or Augmentation, without Generation. For to Nouriſh, is to <hi>ſubſtitute into the place of that which is loſt, as much, and ſuch as is loſt:</hi> namely, <hi>Fleſh,</hi> or <hi>Nerves,</hi> into the <hi>roome</hi> of that <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Nerves,</hi> which are impared. And what is this other, then to make <hi>Fleſh,</hi> or <hi>Nerves?</hi> So likewiſe <hi>Accretion</hi> is not without Generation: For all <hi>Natural bodies,</hi> are <hi>Augmented,</hi> by a new ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of thoſe parts, of which they did conſiſt
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:56144:176"/>
before: and that according to all <hi>dimenſions:</hi> So that they at once do grow, are diſtinguiſhed, and organized together,</p>
            <p>And now, to <hi>Generate a Chicken, is nothing elſe, but to conſtitute all its parts, members and organs:</hi> which though they are made in order, and ſome are <hi>poſt-genit,</hi> or <hi>later productions</hi> then others (as the <hi>leſſe principal parts,</hi> compared with the <hi>more principal)</hi> yet while the <hi>organs</hi> themſelves are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed, their generation doth not proceed in ſuch <hi>order,</hi> that the <hi>ſimilar parts</hi> muſt be firſt made, and the <hi>organical</hi> be afterwards compounded out of them: as if the compounding parts were firſt to exiſt, and then the Compoſition to be raiſed out of them. For though the Head of the Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and the reſt of its Trunck, or corporature (being firſt of a ſimilar conſtitution) do reſemble a <hi>Mucus,</hi> or a ſoft <hi>glewey ſubſtance:</hi> out of which afterwards all the <hi>parts</hi> are framed in their <hi>order:</hi> yet by the ſame operation, and the ſame Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, they are together <hi>made</hi> and <hi>augmented:</hi> and as that ſubſtance reſembling glew doth grow, ſo are the parts diſtinguiſhed. Namely, they are Generated, Altered, and formed at once: they are at once ſimilar and diſſimilar: and from a ſmall ſimilar, is a great <hi>organ</hi> made. In the ſame manner as out of the ſtraw, the ſpike, reeds, and graines do ariſe, and are diſtinguiſhed: and as the Trees, when they ſhoot forth their young buds, do out of them, expand and produce flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, leaves, fruit, and at laſt, ſeed.</p>
            <p>And this we have learnt out of thoſe things which are conſpicuous in an egge, by diligent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of them. For by the effects, the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or operations are perceived; by the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the faculties, and by them, the Operatour
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:56144:176"/>
or Efficient. Wherefore in the Generation of the Chicken, the actions or faculties of the <hi>Generant</hi> (which <hi>Fabricius</hi> recites; namely, the <hi>Immutative</hi> and <hi>Formative)</hi> do not differ <hi>Specie,</hi> nor yet <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum prius &amp; poſterius,</hi> but (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> uſeth to ſpeak) <hi>ipſo eſſe,</hi> and <hi>ratione ſolum:</hi> not as it befals the <hi>actions</hi> of the <hi>nutritive faculty,</hi> after the birth, (to wit, Attraction, Concoction, Diſtribution, and Appoſition) which performe their duties in ſeveral places, and at ſeveral times. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Generative faculty her ſelf, ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced alſo to uſe diverſe inſtruments to perform her ſeveral operations.</p>
            <p>Wherefore <hi>Fabricius</hi> affirms amiſſe, that the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutative Faculty doth operate by the qualities of the <hi>Elements,</hi> namely, Heat, Cold, Moiſture, and Dryneſs: (as being its inſtruments) but that the formative works without them, and after a more divine manner: as if (forſooth) ſhe did finiſh her task, with meditation, choiſe, and providence. For had he looked deeper into the thing, he would have ſeen, that the Formative, as well as the Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative faculty makes uſe of hot, cold, moiſt, and dry, (as her inſtruments) &amp; would have deprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as much divinity and skill, in Nutrition and Immutation, as in the operations of the Formative faculty her ſelf. For <hi>nature</hi> hath inſtituted all thoſe faculties for ſome end; and doth every where work with providence, and underſtanding. Whatſoever it is which makes the ſeed of Plants fruitful, and doth exerciſe a plaſtick virtue in it: and that which in an <hi>egge</hi> executes the office of a moſt skilful Workeman, doth produce and build the parts, and by Calefying Refrigerating, Moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Drying, Concocting, Condenſing, Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Softning, Diſſolving, both Faſhion, and
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:56144:177"/>
Augment them; doth alſo diſtinguiſh them, by Figure, Scite, Conſtitution, Temperature, Number, and Order: diſpoſing and compleating all things, with like providence, election, and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (no leſſe in the alteration, then nutrition, augmentation, and formation of them.)</p>
            <p>I ſay the Concocting, and Immutative; the Nutritive, and Augmenting faculties; (which <hi>Fabricius</hi> would have to buſie themſelves onely about Hot, Cold, Moiſt, and Dry, without all knowledge) do operate with as much artifice, and as much to a deſigned end, as the Formative fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty: which he affirms, to poſſeſs the <hi>knowledge and fore-ſight of the future action, and uſe of every particular part, and Organ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Art of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> the <hi>Bakers</hi> and the <hi>Cooks ſlight</hi> (which ſet on work, the hot, cold, moiſt, and dry, and ſuch like natural Inſtruments) doe no leſs require the exerciſe of reaſon, then Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical Trades, which either work with their own hand, (as the Smith, the Statuaries, and the Potters) or other artificial inſtruments.

            <p>Therefore if it be lawful for us to judge of the faculties by the operations; the Vegetal Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations do rather ſeem to be executed by Art, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, and Providence; then the very actions of the Rational ſoul, and the Mind, though in a moſt perfect man, the top and pinnacle of whoſe Knowledge and Underſtanding, conſiſts chiefly (according to <hi>Apollos</hi> verdit) in this, <hi>ut no ſeat ſe ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum,</hi> that he know himſelf.

               <hi>diviner Artificer</hi> therefore (then man is) ſeems to <hi>make</hi> and <hi>preſerve man:</hi> and a <hi>nobler Agent</hi> then a <hi>Cock,</hi> doth produce a <hi>Chicken</hi> out of the <hi>Egge.</hi> For we acknowledge our <hi>Omnipotent God,</hi> and <hi>moſt high Creator,</hi> to be every where preſent in the <hi>ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture</hi> of all creatures living; and to point himſelf out by his <hi>Workes;</hi> whoſe Inſtruments the <hi>Cock</hi> and <hi>Hen</hi> are in the Generation of the <hi>Chicken.</hi> For it is moſt apparent, that in the Generation of the <hi>Chicken</hi> out of the <hi>egge,</hi> all things are ſet up and formed, with a moſt ſingular <hi>providence, divine wiſdom,</hi> and an <hi>admirable,</hi> and <hi>Incomprehenſible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice.</hi>

            <p>Nor can theſe <hi>Attributes</hi> appertain to any, but to the <hi>Omnipotent Maker of all things,</hi> under what name ſoever we cloud and veil him: whether it be, <hi>Mens divina,</hi> the divine <hi>Mind,</hi> with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> or <hi>Anima mundi,</hi> the ſoul of the Univerſe, with <hi>Plato;</hi> or with others, <hi>Natura Naturans,</hi> Nature of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture her ſelf; or elſe <hi>Saturnus,</hi> or <hi>Jupiter,</hi> with the <hi>Heathen;</hi> or rather, as befits us, the <hi>Creatour, and Father of all things in Heaven, and Earth:</hi> upon whom all <hi>Animals,</hi> and their <hi>births</hi> depend: and at whoſe <hi>Beck,</hi> or <hi>Mandat,</hi> all things are <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> and <hi>begotten.</hi>

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:56144:178"/>
from whence they ſpring: and the parts (which we ſee made already) are more intelligible in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, then the actions which framed them.</p>
            <p>Nor do thoſe things which are to be conſidered and determined in the general obſervation of all <hi>Animals,</hi> fall properly within the compaſs of the <hi>particular generation</hi> of the <hi>Chicken</hi> out of the <hi>Egge.</hi> But of them more hereafter.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, we ſhall proceed to the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> of the <hi>Generation</hi> of the <hi>parts. It remaines,</hi> ſaith <hi>Fabricius, that we conſider and contemplate in what Order, that is, which part is made firſt, and which after in the Egge. In proſecution whereof there are two foundations to be laid: one in reſpect of the body: the other in relation to the incorporeal ſubſtance, as, the Nature or Soul. I call that</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal foundation, which depends upon, and flowes from the Nature of the body: and whereof an inſtance is eaſily deduced from things made by art: For, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very edifice doth firſt require a foundation, upon which the whole frame is to be laid and ſupported: whence the walls are ſet up, which do ſuſtaine the Floors and Roofe: and then the Houſhold-ſtuff, and other furniture are introduced; ſo doth nature proceed in the Fabrick of Animals. For firſt ſhe laies the Bones as the foundation, that all the parts of the Body may grow to, hang, upon, and be eſtabliſhed by them. Which bones are firſt made under another capacity. For ſince Bones take their firſt riſe from a moſt ſoft and membranous ſubſtance, and doe afterwards attaine their induration; therefore much time muſt be allotted to the Generation of the Bones, that ſo they may become the hardeſt parts; and hereupon they are begotten firſt. And for this reaſon</hi> Galen <hi>did not compare the ſtructure of an Animal to every kind of building, but chiefly to that of a Ship. For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>as the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi>
               <pb n="313" facs="tcp:56144:178"/>
               <hi>and original of the Ship is the Keel, from which the ſides, or planks imbowed, and placed at a diſtance one from the other (like a Hurdle) are ſet up on both ſides, that ſo the whole frame of the Ship may be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards finiſhed out of the Keel, as a convenient foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; So in the fabrick of an Animal, Nature firſt ſtretcheth out the Chine bone, with the Ribbes drawn round it, as the Keel, and congruous principle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhe foundeth and finiſheth the whole Pile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Experience</hi> doth abundantly confute this phanſie: for it is evident, that the <hi>Bones</hi> are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made laſt of all. For the <hi>Bones</hi> of the <hi>Limbs,</hi> the <hi>Skull</hi> and <hi>Teeth,</hi> are not made before the <hi>Brain,</hi> the <hi>Muſcles,</hi> and <hi>fleſhey parts;</hi> but even after the nativity, in the tender, and (otherwiſe) perfect <hi>foetus,</hi> they are onely <hi>Griſtles,</hi> and <hi>Membranes,</hi> and afterwards in tract of time arrive to the <hi>ſolidity</hi> of <hi>Bones,</hi> as doth appear by <hi>Infants Skulls,</hi> and the <hi>Ribbes</hi> and <hi>Joints</hi> of <hi>Embryo</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>And though it be true, that the firſt platforme of the body appears like a Bent or incurved Keel, yet is it of a ſoft, mucous, and glutinous conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, no way reſembling either the <hi>Nature, Conſtitution,</hi> or <hi>Office</hi> of a <hi>Bone.</hi> As alſo the ſmall <hi>Globous bodies</hi> which are its appendixes (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the parts of the <hi>Head)</hi> have no <hi>ſolidity</hi> at all in them, but are onely <hi>Veſicles</hi> ſtuffed with clear water, which are afterward transformed into the <hi>Braine, After-braine,</hi> and <hi>Eyes;</hi> and are at laſt fenced with the <hi>Skull,</hi> namely, after the <hi>Bill,</hi> and <hi>Clawes</hi> have attained <hi>ſolidity,</hi> and <hi>obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore this Contemplation of <hi>Fabricius</hi> is a ſleepy, and injurious one; He not conſidering what really is done by <hi>nature</hi> in the <hi>order</hi> of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,</hi> but rather what nature according to his
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:56144:179"/>
phanſie, ought to have done; as if Nature did imitate <hi>Art,</hi> and <hi>Art</hi> were not rather <hi>Natures Ape.</hi> Which comming into his head, himſelf afterwards ſaith, <hi>Satius fuerit dicere,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It is a more dilibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> 
               <note place="margin">pag. 44.</note> 
               <hi>aſſertion to ſay, that Art was Natures Scholar, and wrought by her Copy: becauſe as</hi> Galen <hi>every where pronounceth, Nature is of more Antiquity, and wiſer in her productions then Art.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though the <hi>bones</hi> are the foundation of the whole <hi>body,</hi> without which it can nor ſtand nor move: yet it is ſufficient for them, if they are made together with thoſe <hi>parts,</hi> which do rely upon them. For where the things which are to be upheld are not in being, the <hi>Props</hi> are provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to no purpoſe. But nature doth nothing raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; nor conſtitutes <hi>parts,</hi> before there is uſe of them. But all Animals attaine their parts, ſo ſoon as action and uſefulneſs is required of them. And therefore this firſt foundation of <hi>Fabricius</hi> his laying, countenanced by his own obſervations in the <hi>Egge,</hi> and <hi>Galens ſimile,</hi> is clean demoliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>He ſeems to come neerer the Mark, when hee ſaith, <hi>The other foundation of producing the parts in order, is deſumed from Nature, that is, the ſoul; which is Queen Regent of the animal body. For ſince there are two degrees of the ſoul, the Vegetal and Senſative; and the Vegetal is,</hi> tempore &amp; naturâ prior, <hi>firſt both in time and nature, becauſe it is common to the very Plants; doubtleſs the Inſtruments ſubſervient to the Vegetal, are firſt to be made and fitted, before thoſe that attend the ſenſitive and motive faculties: eſpecially the more principal ones, and where the Queen keeps Court. Now theſe are chiefly two, the Liver, and the Heart: the Liver as the throne of the Vegetal or Nutritive: and the Heart as that Miniſter of State,</hi>
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:56144:179"/>
               <hi>who by his heat and warmth, doth enliven and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat both the Vegetal, and other Faculties, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore holds a ſtrong league and confederacy with the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getal. Wherefore if after three dayes Incubation, you diſcern in that part of the egge where the Chicken is bred, the heart panting, (as</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>alſo teſtifieth) muſe not at it, but conclude that the heart relates to the vegetal Faculty, and is therefore the firſt begotten. Now it is alſo conſonant to Reaſon, that the Liver alſo ſhould be Twinne to the Heart, and born with it, but doth not appear, becauſe he wants a palpitation, which the Heart hath. For even</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>himſelf ſaith, That the Liver and the Heart are conſtituted in the body up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on like grounds; ſo that if there be a Heart, there muſt be a Liver too. If therefore the Liver and Heart are firſt begotten, it alſo followes, that the other Organs that are menial ſervants relating to theſe two, ſhould be begotten together with them; as, the Lungs for the Heart; and for the Liver, almoſt all the parts which are contained in the Lower Belly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all this is very wide from that <hi>order</hi> and <hi>progreſs</hi> which we ſee in the <hi>Egge.</hi> Nor is it true, that the <hi>Liver</hi> is born together with the <hi>Heart:</hi> nor will that ſhift ſerve his turn, where he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, <hi>Latere Jecur, quia non palpitat,</hi> that the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> lyeth concealed, becauſe it is not expoſed by <hi>palpitation.</hi> For the <hi>Eyes,</hi> the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> and the <hi>Carina,</hi> the <hi>Keel,</hi> are diſcerned even from the very firſt, yet have they no <hi>palpitation.</hi> What impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then to barre the <hi>Liver</hi> and <hi>Lungs</hi> (if they are then in being) from being <hi>ſeen?</hi> Nay, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in his <hi>Figure</hi> or <hi>Table,</hi> repreſenting the <hi>fourth day,</hi> hath deſcribed a <hi>ſmall Point</hi> in the midſt, and yet he hath not ſignified any <hi>palpitation</hi> belonging to it; nor did he own it for the <hi>Heart,</hi> but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it to be the <hi>firſt rudiment</hi> of the <hi>body:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:56144:180"/>
he ſpeaks onely out of <hi>conjecture,</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entertained opinion,</hi> when he proclaims the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality</hi> of the <hi>Liver:</hi> as other men have alſo done, (namely, <hi>Aldrovandus,</hi> and <hi>Pariſanus)</hi> who caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally lighting upon <hi>two Points,</hi> and could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a <hi>Pulſe</hi> in both, at one and the ſame time, conceived the one to be the <hi>Heart,</hi> and the other the <hi>Liver.</hi> As if the <hi>Liver</hi> had any <hi>pulſe</hi> at all; but thoſe <hi>two Points</hi> are the two <hi>Veſiculae Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantes,</hi> returning anſwer to each other in alternate <hi>contractions;</hi> as hath been noted in our <hi>Hiſtory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, either <hi>Fabricius</hi> is deceived, or doth deceive, where he ſaith, <hi>Preſently in the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of generation, the Liver, Heart, Veines, Arteries, Lungs, and all the parts contained in the lower belly; likewiſe the Keel, that is, the Head, with the Eyes, and the whole Spine and Cheſt, are born and framed.</hi> For the <hi>Heart, Veins,</hi> and <hi>Arteries,</hi> are perfectly <hi>diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed,</hi> for ſome time, before the <hi>Keel;</hi> and the <hi>Carina,</hi> or <hi>Keel,</hi> before the <hi>Eyes;</hi> and the <hi>Eyes,</hi> the <hi>Bill,</hi> and <hi>Sides,</hi> before the Members contained in the <hi>lower belly:</hi> and alſo the <hi>Stomack,</hi> and <hi>Guts,</hi> before the <hi>Liver,</hi> or <hi>Lungs,</hi> are diſcerned. And that <hi>order</hi> is obſerved in <hi>generation,</hi> which we ſhall preſently deſcribe.</p>
            <p>He is likewiſe deceived, when he decrees the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getal part</hi> to have a being both in time and nature before the <hi>ſenſitive</hi> and the <hi>motive.</hi> For that which is firſt in <hi>Nature,</hi> is for the moſt part after, in the <hi>order</hi> of <hi>Generation.</hi> In time, indeed, the <hi>Vegetal part</hi> is <hi>before,</hi> becauſe the <hi>ſenſitive ſoule</hi> cannot be without it. For it cannot actually exiſt in the <hi>body</hi> without <hi>Organs,</hi> it being <hi>Actus corporis Organici,</hi> the Act of the Organical bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: but the <hi>ſenſitive</hi> and <hi>motive Organs,</hi> are the <hi>workmanſhip</hi> of the <hi>vegetative;</hi> and the <hi>ſenſitive</hi>
               <pb n="317" facs="tcp:56144:180"/>
               <hi>ſoul</hi> (before it actually exiſt) is <hi>tanquam Trigonus in Tetragono,</hi> like a <hi>Triangle</hi> in a <hi>Quadrangle.</hi> But <hi>Nature</hi> firſt intends that which is moſt principal and noble; and therefore the <hi>Vegetal faculty</hi> is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the order of <hi>Nature,</hi> as being ſubſervient to the <hi>ſenſitive,</hi> and <hi>motive Faculty.</hi>

               <hi>is ordained, it proceeds as Seeds do.

            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Principle</hi> in an <hi>Egge</hi> (analogous to the <hi>bloſſom</hi> of <hi>Plants)</hi> we with <hi>Fabricius</hi> call <hi>Macula,</hi> a <hi>Speck,</hi> or <hi>Cicatricula,</hi> a ſmall <hi>Cicatrice:</hi> which we have avouched to be the principal particle, in which all the other parts are <hi>in potentiâ,</hi> &amp; whence afterwards they ariſe in their order.

               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>ſenſe, but according to reaſon. For ſince that which is begotten is now disjoyned from both parents, it ought to demean, govern, and diſpoſe of it ſelf, as a Son ſet free by his Father, and ſeated apart. And therefore a Principle,</hi> and that an Intrinſecal one, <hi>muſt needs be had, by which afterwards the order of the Parts is to be preſcribed, and all things relating to the complement of the Animal, managed, and diſpoſed. For if it were Extrinſecal at any time, and afterwards began to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in, you would not only be in ſuſpenſe, and queſtion when it went in, but</hi> conclude, <hi>that ſince each part is diſtinguiſhed, it was neceſſary that part ſhould ſubſiſt, out of which both growth and motion is conferred upon the other parts.</hi> In another place he ſaith, <hi>The firſt Principle is a part of the whole, and not any ſeparate thing, which is contained apart from it. For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>when the Animal is now generated, is that Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple corrupted, or doth it remain? Now nothing ſeems to be in, which is not a part of the whole, be it Plant, or Animal. And that it ſhould be corrupted, when it hath been</hi> at the expence of <hi>making all, or ſome of the parts, is very abſurd; for what ſhall make the remainder? Wherefore</hi> (he proceeds) <hi>who ſide with</hi> Democritus, <hi>ſaying, That the exteriour parts of the Animal are firſt made, and then the interiour: as if they were to build a wodden or ſtony Animal, do not ſay well; for ſuch a creature as that hath no Principle in it ſelf. But all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals</hi>
               <pb n="319" facs="tcp:56144:181"/>
               <hi>have, and contain one within them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Heart is firſt ſeen in all Animals, in which there is blood; for that is the Principle of the ſimilar, and diſſimilar parts. Now that thing which requires Aliment, ought already to have received that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of an Animal, and conſtituted</hi> Foetus.</p>
            <p>Which words do plainly declare, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> did conclude of an Order in the Generation of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals,</hi> and of a <hi>Principal part,</hi> namely, the <hi>Heart,</hi> which (like a <hi>Son</hi> at liberty) is the <hi>firſt animate,</hi> and <hi>primogenit part</hi> of the <hi>Animal,</hi> contained, and abiding in it: whence not onely the method of the <hi>parts</hi> is ſet down, but the <hi>Animal</hi> it ſelf, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and relyes upon it, receiving continual life and <hi>ſuſtenance;</hi> and that thence, whatſoever is neceſſary to the perfection of the <hi>Animal,</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived. For, (as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith) <hi>in the Seed is the whole</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Now whether the <hi>Heart</hi> be the <hi>Primigenial part,</hi> or no, we have determined above. To wit, if <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotles</hi> ſpeech be underſtood of that <hi>part,</hi> which (in the <hi>Anatomy</hi> of <hi>Living creatures)</hi> is ſeen by the eye to be before the reſt, (that is, of the <hi>Punctum ſaliens,</hi> together with the <hi>Veines</hi> ſtreaming with <hi>blood)</hi> we cheerfully embrace his judgement. For we believe, that the <hi>Blood,</hi> together with the <hi>Veſſels,</hi> and <hi>Inſtruments;</hi> namely, the <hi>Umbilical Veines,</hi> (by which, as by <hi>Roots,</hi> the Nutriment is attracted) and <hi>Veſiculae pulſantes</hi> (to whom it is diſtributed for the life and growth of the <hi>parts)</hi> is conſtituted before any other. <hi>For</hi> (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith) <hi>the matter by which any thing is augmented,</hi>

            </lg>
            <p>But <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> moſt truly ſaith: <hi>Diſtinction of parts is not, as ſome ſuppoſe, upon that ground, that Like is</hi> 
               <note place="margin">In the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> 
               <hi>of its own nature tending to its Like: for beſides ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other difficulties which beſet that opinion, it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that every ſimilar part muſt be ordained apart by it ſelf: as for inſtance; Bones by themſelves, Nerves, and Fleſh by themſelves, in caſe that opinion be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi> But, indeed, the <hi>Nutriment</hi> of all <hi>parts</hi> is <hi>common</hi> and <hi>ſimilar,</hi> as the <hi>Yolk</hi> in the <hi>Egge;</hi> and not <hi>heterogeneous,</hi> and compounded of diverſe <hi>parts.</hi> And therefore what we have ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:56144:182"/>
the <hi>matter</hi> out of which the Parts are made: we pronounce the ſame of the <hi>matter</hi> out of which they are augmented; namely, that the parts do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume their Nouriſhment out of that <hi>matter,</hi> in which all the Parts are <hi>in potentiâ,</hi> but none <hi>actu.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As out of the ſame <hi>Showre</hi> all kinds of <hi>Plants</hi> take growth, becauſe that moiſture, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore like <hi>in potentiâ</hi> to them all, is now made like them <hi>actu,</hi> being transformed into their <hi>ſubſtance;</hi> And is alſo <hi>bitter</hi> in <hi>Rue, ſharp</hi> in the <hi>Muſtard,</hi> and <hi>ſweet</hi> in <hi>Licoriſe;</hi> and ſo in the reſt.</p>
            <p>He goes on, to explain what Parts are generated before others; and that with a reaſon not much unlike <hi>Fabricius</hi> his <hi>Fundamentum ſecundum,</hi> his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ground or foundation, ſaying, <hi>Id cujus cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sâ, &amp; quod ejus causâ, differunt; &amp; alterum genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione, alterum eſſentiâ prius eſt;</hi> namely, the <hi>End</hi> is firſt in <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Eſſence,</hi> in reſpect of that thing which is made for the <hi>Ends</hi> ſake; but That which is made for the <hi>Ends</hi> ſake, muſt needs be firſt in <hi>Generation.</hi> And by that Argument <hi>Fabricius</hi> rightly inferrs, that thoſe Parts which are ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to the <hi>Vegetative ſoul,</hi> are all made before thoſe which are <hi>inſtrumental</hi> to the <hi>ſenſative,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that is <hi>ſubordinate</hi> to this.</p>
            <p>After this, he ſubjoines the differences of ſuch things as are made for any <hi>End;</hi> namely, that ſome things are inſtituted for ſome <hi>End</hi> by <hi>nature,</hi> becauſe the <hi>End</hi> doth enſue upon them: but ſome, becauſe they are <hi>Inſtruments</hi> which the <hi>End</hi> makes uſe of: and thoſe he calls <hi>Genitalia,</hi> but theſe, <hi>Inſtrumentalia.</hi> For the End, ſaith he, in ſome things is <hi>after,</hi> and in ſome, <hi>before</hi> thoſe things which are their <hi>cauſes.</hi> For the <hi>Generant</hi> himſelf, and that which he imployes in <hi>Generation,</hi> muſt needs exiſt before that which is <hi>generated</hi> by them.
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:56144:183"/>
And therefore the Parts ſubſervient to the <hi>Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſoul,</hi> are before thoſe which are retained by <hi>Senſe,</hi> and <hi>Motion.</hi> But the Parts dedicated to <hi>Motion</hi> and the <hi>Senſes,</hi> are after the <hi>ſenſitive</hi> and <hi>motive Faculties;</hi> as being <hi>inſtrumental,</hi> and made uſe of by the <hi>ſenſitive</hi> and <hi>motive Faculty.</hi> For by <hi>Natures Law,</hi> no Parts or Inſtruments are made and conſtituted, before there be <hi>imployment</hi> for them, and a <hi>faculty</hi> be ready at hand, to ſet them to work. So neither the <hi>Eye,</hi> nor the <hi>Inſtruments</hi> of <hi>Motion</hi> are ſet up, till the <hi>Brain</hi> is built, or the <hi>faculty</hi> be already provided, which is to See, or Move.</p>
            <p>In like manner, becauſe the <hi>Veſiculae pulſantes</hi> do (as Inſtruments) miniſter to the <hi>motion</hi> of the <hi>Blood;</hi> and likewiſe the whole Frame and Fabrick of the Heart (as we have evidenced in our Book <hi>de Motu Sanguinis)</hi> is Inſtrumental; (namely, that the <hi>Blood</hi> may be continually hurried round the <hi>Body</hi> in a <hi>Circle)</hi> the <hi>Blood</hi> ſeems to have a being both in Order of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Generation</hi> before the <hi>Heart;</hi> which he imployes as an Inſtrument, having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten it alſo, and doth perſiſt to <hi>nouriſh,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey <hi>heat, ſpirits,</hi> &amp; <hi>life</hi> unto it by the <hi>Coronal Artery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how this General Rule of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>prae-ordering</hi> of the Parts, doth appear to be true by <hi>Anatomical Obſervation,</hi> we ſhall declare hereafter. In the mean time, we will enquire, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what manner he himſelf doth ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of <hi>Priority,</hi> as I may ſo ſay, in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, according to this <hi>Rule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>After the Principle</hi> (namely the <hi>Heart) are the Interiour parts begotten, before the exteriour; the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, before the inferiour: for the inferiour are for the ſuperiours ſakes, as being their inſtrument: after the pattern obſerved in Plants, which ſhoot forth their Roots, before their Branches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="323" facs="tcp:56144:183"/>
But <hi>Nature</hi> doth not uſe that method in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; nor is the inſtance alwayes true; for in <hi>Beanes, Ciches,</hi> and other Pulſe, alſo in <hi>Acornes</hi> or <hi>Maſt,</hi> and <hi>Corne,</hi> it is apparent that at the ſame time, the <hi>Stalk</hi> ſhootes upward from the ſame <hi>Bud,</hi> and the <hi>Roots</hi> downward. Likewiſe <hi>Onions,</hi> and other <hi>bulbous</hi> plants, do germinate upwards before they fix downwards.</p>
            <p>But he adjoines another cauſe of this order; to wit, <hi>Nature makes nothing ſuperfluous, nor nothing in vaine, whence it appears, that nothing is made by her, either before or after another, otherwiſe then need requires.</hi> Namely, thoſe parts are firſt genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whoſe uſes and functions are firſt required: ſome alſo are ſooner begun, becauſe they call for more time to perfect them, that ſo they may be ready for the birth, together with others that are forwarder then they. As the <hi>Cook</hi> being to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a feaſt, where ſome proviſions (by reaſon of their ſolidity) aske a ſlower fire, and longer time to prepare them, he laies them down to the fire firſt: but to thoſe that are ſooner diſpatched, and are dreſſed with a gentler heat, he applyeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe laſt: and ſuch alſo as are to be ſerved up in the firſt courſe, he makes ready firſt, but thoſe in the ſecond, laſt. So likewiſe nature, in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Animals, is late ere ſhe delineate the moiſt, ſoft, and fleſhey parts, (as being quickly cooked, and reduced into ſhape) but for the hard and more ſolid (as the <hi>bones)</hi> becauſe they exact a large Evaporation, and Exſiccation, and their matter continues long indigeſted, to them ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes her ſelfe firſt of all. <hi>For in the Braine alſo,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the ſame falls out, namely, that at firſt it is very moiſt, and great in quantity: but anon, the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity evaporating, and being concocted, it growes</hi>
               <pb n="324" facs="tcp:56144:184"/>
               <hi>more ſolid, and ſo the quantity of the Head, and Eyes, do abate. In the beginning therefore, the Head ſeems very bigge</hi> (in compariſon of all the reſt of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which it much exceeds in <hi>bulke) by reaſon of the Braine: and the eyes very large, by reaſon of the humour conteined in them. But yet the eyes are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected laſt; becauſe even the Braine it ſelfe is long ere it grow to a conſiſtence. For it is long ere it get the maſtery, and drein the water, and eſpecially in a Man. For the</hi> Sinciput <hi>is laſt confirmed of all the Bones; for that bone is yet ſoft, even when the Child is born into the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He alſo proceeds to another reaſon; namely, that the parts are framed of different materials. <hi>The more noble parts,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and thoſe that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate the worthieſt principles, are conſtituted of the concocted, pureſt, and chiefeſt aliment: the other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary parts, made for their ſakes, are faſhioned out of the baſer matter, the reliques, and dregs. For Nature, like a prudent Maſter of a Family, loſeth nothing, out of which he can make any advantage, but ſo manages the matter in his houſe, that his Children may fare beſt, his Servants harder then they, and the ſcraps or refuſe thrown to the Dogs. As therefore,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cremento jam addito, mens advena facit haec, <hi>that is,</hi> (as I interpret it) a prudent man grown to years of diſcretion, diſpoſes thus of his Charge; <hi>So in the framing of things, Nature (by an inbred wiſdome and prudence) formes the fleſh, and ſubſtance of the inſtruments of ſenſe, out of the moſt refined mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but the</hi> Bones, Nerves, Hair, Nailes, Hoofes, <hi>and the like, out of the Dregs,</hi> (that is the refuſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders, or fragments) <hi>And therefore theſe are made laſt, when nature hath now good ſtore of courſe materials. And after this,</hi> he diſtinguiſheth <hi>of two ſorts of Aliment; one of Nutrition, the other of Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.</hi>
               <pb n="325" facs="tcp:56144:184"/>
               <hi>That of Nutrition,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>doth ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a being to the whole, and all the parts, that of augmentation procureth an acceſſion to the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to what we finde in the <hi>Egge;</hi> where the White (as the more <hi>refined Aliment)</hi> relates to the <hi>firſt Nutrition</hi> of the Chicken; the Yolk to its augmentation. And the thinner White (as hath been ſhewed) conduceth to the formation of the Firſt, and nobler Parts; but the Courſer, and the Yolk, to the augmentation of the Nobler, and formation of the more Ignoble. For, he ſaith, <hi>the Nerves are framed as the Bones, out of the ſeminal and nutritive excrement. But the</hi> Nailes, Haire, Spurres, <hi>and all like theſe, are formed out of augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative, and adventitious meats; which the</hi> Foetus <hi>both receives from the Mother, and alſo doth provide of it ſelfe.</hi> And after this he at laſt gives the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why <hi>Man</hi> (ſince other <hi>Animals</hi> are provided with their Garments, and Weapons at <hi>Natures</hi> price) ſhould be borne naked, and unarmed; namely, that thoſe kind of parts are conſtituted of the <hi>excrementitious parts,</hi> and reliques, but the materials of <hi>Men</hi> are purer, in which there is very litle terrene, or crude excrement to be found.</p>
            <p>And thus far have we made uſe of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Order of Generation: where all ſeems to be bottomed upon one foundation; namely, <hi>Natures Perfection;</hi> which in all her Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, hath nothing <hi>ſhort,</hi> nor nothing <hi>ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> but always diſpoſeth matters for the beſt. And therefore no parts had been precedent or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent to one another, if it had been more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to have formed them altogether; which is to be underſtood of Her, as often as ſhe acts free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and by choice. For ſometimes ſhe acts other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:56144:185"/>
being as it were under conſtraint, and put beſide her purpoſe; which happens, when either by defect of matter, or ſuperfluity thereof, or by the default of her inſtruments, or ſome outward impediments, ſhe is hindered in her work, and fruſtrated of her aime, or end. And hence it comes to paſs ſometimes, that the <hi>final parts</hi> are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated before the <hi>Inſtrumental:</hi> I call thoſe <hi>final parts,</hi> which employ others, (as their inſtruments.)</p>
            <p>And becauſe ſome parts are Genital parts, which Nature ſets to work about the Generation of other parts, or elſe to remove ſome Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in her proceedings, which in caſe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, the Generation may be retarded: and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are under another capacity: therefore it comes to paſs, that according to the diſpoſition of the matter, and other requiſites, the parts are diverſly made ſome after other, and ſome of them are in hand before, but are not finiſhed till after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: ſome are begun and finiſhed before others are begun, and others are as ſoon begun as their fellows, but finiſhed after them. And therefore in the generation of ſome <hi>Animals,</hi> the ſame order is not always obſerved, but it is much different and various; and in ſome no order at all: but all the parts are begun, and finiſhed at a heat: namely by a <hi>Metamorphoſis,</hi> as we ſhewed. And laſtly, hence it happens that the <hi>Primogenit part</hi> is ſuch, that in it is concluded both the <hi>Beginning,</hi> and the <hi>End;</hi> as well that for whoſe ſake all are made (namely the <hi>ſoul)</hi> as alſo that which is its cauſe in chief, and Genital part. The Heart therefore (or, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my perſwaſion, the <hi>Blood)</hi> is the firſt throne of the <hi>Soul;</hi> the fountain of life; the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal fire; the Genital warmth; and the very <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidum Innatum;</hi> the firſt Efficient of all his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:56144:185"/>
parts, having atcheived the ſoul for his end, which commands them all as her leige-peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The Heart I ſay, (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> will have it) is he, for whoſe ſake the whole Fabrick and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the parts are provided, and who alſo is the Fountain, and Father of them all.</p>

            <head>EXER. LVI.</head>
            <p>THat we may at laſt propoſe our own opinion of the Order of Parts, as we have collected it out of ſeveral Obſervations of our own; we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to diſtinguiſh the whole work of Generation (in all <hi>Animals</hi> whatſoever) into two Fabricks.</p>
            <p>Whereof the firſt is that of the Egge; namely, of the Conception, and Seed, or of that, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is, which (in <hi>Spontaneous productions)</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth in proportion to Seed; whether we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it under the notion of <hi>Calidum nativum coeleſte in humido primigenio,</hi> the Innate celeſtial ſubſtance, in the Primigenial moiſt, with <hi>Ferne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> or with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> of <hi>Calor Vitalis in humors comprehenſus,</hi> the vital heat concluded in moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture. For the Conception in Viviparous Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals (as we have ſaid) is anſwerable to the Seed and Fruit of Plants; as alſo the Egge, in Ovipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; in Spontaneous productions, the Worme, or ſome <hi>Bulla</hi> teeming by the Vital heat of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined moiſture. In all which the ſame thing is
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:56144:186"/>
comprehended, which may truly call them Seeds; namely, out of which, and by which (as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Efficient, and pre-exiſtent Organ) every <hi>Animal</hi> is firſt made and borne.</p>
            <p>The Other Fabrick is of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> born out of the Seed, or Conception. For the Matter, and the Final, and Efficient cauſes, and the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments neceſſary to the worke, muſt firſt be, before any part of the Production can begin.</p>
            <p>The Fabrick of the Egge we have already ſeen: but that of the <hi>Foetus</hi> (ſo far as we could diſcover out of diſſections) is perfected (eſpecially in the more perfect race of <hi>Animals,</hi> and ſuch as have <hi>blood)</hi> chiefly by four degrees, or proceſſions: which according to the ſeveral times of generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we ſhall reduce into as many Orders; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrating withall that the ſame thing which is diſcerned in the Egge, is alike in every concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſeed.</p>
            <p>The Firſt progreſs is of the Primogenit, and Genital part, namely of the <hi>blood,</hi> with its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles, or if you will have it ſo, of the Heart and his Veins.</p>
            <p>Now this part is firſt begotten, chiefly for two reaſons, both becauſe it is the principal part, which makes uſe of all the reſt, as its Inſtruments; and for whoſe ſake the other parts ſeem to be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: as alſo, becauſe it is the Chiefe Genital part, the Fountain and Author of the reſt; The part in which is concluded both the <hi>Beginning</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of Generation; the ſame being <hi>Pater &amp; Rex,</hi> Parent, and Sovereign.</p>
            <p>In the Generation of theſe Parts, (which is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in the Egge the Fourth day) though I could not obſerve any Order; becauſe all its par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles <hi>(Blood, Veins,</hi> and <hi>Veſicula pulſans)</hi> appear
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:56144:186"/>
at once; yet I believe (as I ſaid) that the <hi>blood</hi> is in it, before the <hi>Pulſe:</hi> and that it alſo in Natures Law, is before it <hi>receptacles,</hi> the <hi>Veins:</hi> for the ſubſtance and ſtructure of the Heart (namely the one with its <hi>Ventricles</hi> and <hi>Auricles)</hi> as it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated long after with the other Intrals, ſo ought it to be regiſtered in their <hi>Claſſis,</hi> which is the Third.</p>
            <p>In this ſtructure, the <hi>veines</hi> are conſpicuous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Arteries,</hi> at leaſt, as farre as we could <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Second Journal,</hi> which ſets out after the <hi>fourth day,</hi> diſcovers a certain <hi>Concrementum,</hi> or <hi>coagulated ſubſtance,</hi> which I call <hi>Vermiculum, ſeu Galbam,</hi> the litle <hi>Worm,</hi> or <hi>Magot;</hi> (for it ſeems to enjoy the life and obſcure motion of a <hi>Galba)</hi> and this, as it congeals into a <hi>gelly,</hi> is divided into <hi>two parts;</hi> whereof the <hi>upper</hi> and the <hi>larger</hi> is <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>globated,</hi> and diſtinguiſhed into <hi>three Veſicles;</hi> namely, that of the <hi>Brain, After-brain,</hi> and one of the <hi>Eyes:</hi> but the <hi>leſſer, carinam referens,</hi> reſembling the <hi>Keel</hi> of a <hi>Ship,</hi> is ſuperinduced upon the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> and is extended according to its length.</p>
            <p>In the ſtructure of the <hi>Head,</hi> the <hi>Eyes</hi> are firſt diſcerned, and anon a <hi>white ſpot</hi> ſtarts up for the <hi>Bill,</hi> and the <hi>filme drying</hi> about, it becomes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by a <hi>membrane.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this time alſo the <hi>adumbration,</hi> or rough <hi>draft</hi> of the reſt of the <hi>Body</hi> ſeems to ſucceed; where firſt upon the <hi>Carina</hi> the <hi>ſides</hi> or <hi>plancks,</hi> as it were, of a <hi>Boat</hi> ſeem to ariſe; being at firſt of a <hi>ſimilar conſiſtence,</hi> but afterwards by moſt <hi>white ſtreaks</hi> they are ſignified to be the lines of the <hi>Ribs.</hi> After this, the <hi>members</hi> of <hi>Motion,</hi> namely, the <hi>Wings</hi> and <hi>Legs</hi> do appear: and at laſt the <hi>Keel,</hi> and <hi>Limbs</hi> born by a kinde of <hi>Superfoetation,</hi> are
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:56144:187"/>
diſtinguiſhed into <hi>Muſcles, Bones,</hi> and <hi>Joints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe two firſt miſhapen materials of the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> do together appear, and are together diſtinguiſhed: but afterwards, when they tend towards growth and perfection, the <hi>body</hi> gets the ſtart, and is much ſooner grown and ſhaped; ſo that the <hi>Head</hi> which did at firſt out-ſtrip the whole <hi>body</hi> beſide, in bulk and magnitude, is now very much ſhort of it. And this is likewiſe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to <hi>humane productions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The like Diſparity is between the <hi>Body</hi> it ſelfe &amp; the <hi>Limbs;</hi> for in an <hi>Infant</hi> (from that time that the <hi>Embryo</hi> exceeds not the length of the Nail of the litle Finger, till he be encreaſed to the ſtature of a <hi>Frog,</hi> or a <hi>Mouſe)</hi> his <hi>Arms</hi> are ſo ſhort, that if you ſtretch out his <hi>fingers</hi> over his <hi>breaſt,</hi> to their fartheſt extent, they will not be able to touch one another; and his <hi>thighs</hi> are ſo ſhort, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reflected upon his <hi>Abdomen,</hi> they will hardly reach to his <hi>Navel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, in Children <hi>lately born,</hi> the proportion of the bulk of the <hi>Body</hi> is a pretty deal larger then that of the <hi>Limbs,</hi> untill they are able to ſtand, and go. And therefore <hi>Infants</hi> are firſt <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> and crawle like <hi>beaſts,</hi> &amp; attempt to move on, though upon <hi>all four:</hi> but go upright they cannot, till the <hi>prolixity</hi> of their <hi>Legs</hi> and <hi>Thighs</hi> exceed the <hi>longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> of the reſt of the <hi>Body.</hi> And hence is it, that their firſt venture to foot it, repreſents them a <hi>prone</hi> kinde of <hi>Cattell,</hi> which can ſcarce exalt themſelves to the erection of a <hi>Cock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore amongſt grown perſons, the <hi>long ſlimme Fellows,</hi> (whoſe <hi>Thighs,</hi> but eſpecially their <hi>Shanks,</hi> are longer then ordinary) can <hi>ſtand, walk, run,</hi> or <hi>vault</hi> longer, and at more eaſe, then <hi>ſquare,</hi> and <hi>well truſſed men.</hi>

In this <hi>ſecond Proceſs,</hi> ſeveral actions of the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative faculty</hi> purſuing one another, may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; (as in the <hi>Automata,</hi> or <hi>engines</hi> that go of themſelves; where the <hi>fore-going wheel</hi> ſets his <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower</hi> upon motion too) and all the <hi>parts</hi> ſpring from the ſame <hi>gelly,</hi> and <hi>ſimilar ſubſtance.</hi> Not as <note place="margin">

               <hi>ſome Natural Philoſophers expound it, who ſay, that Like is hurried unto its like: but we muſt ſay, That the parts are moved not by changing their ſtation, but remaining where they were, and altering in ſoftneſs, hardneſs, complexion, and thoſe other differences of ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar parts; being now made thoſe things</hi> Actu, <hi>which they were before</hi> in Potentiâ: that is, the <hi>Limbs,</hi> the <hi>Spine,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Body,</hi> are altogether for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and encreaſed, are together deſcribed, and complexioned: alſo the <hi>Bones, Fleſh, Nerves,</hi> and <hi>Griſtles,</hi> which were all <hi>ſimilar</hi> at <hi>firſt</hi> in the ſame <hi>members,</hi> and of one kinde of <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> in <hi>progreſs</hi> of <hi>Time</hi> are plainly <hi>diſtinct;</hi> and being conjoined, make up <hi>Organical</hi> Parts, by whoſe mutual <hi>conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion</hi> and <hi>continuity</hi> the whole <hi>body</hi> is compiled. So in the <hi>Head,</hi> the <hi>membrane</hi> growing every where light, the <hi>Brain</hi> arrives to its conſiſtence, the <hi>Eyes</hi> are poliſhed out of a fluid inſtable moiſture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nature</hi> doth feed and enlarge all the Parts, out of the ſelf ſame Nutriment, whereof the <hi>firſt</hi> did frame them, (not as many will have it, out of a diverſe one, and ſuch as is like to every particle) namely, by augmenting her ſame <hi>gelly,</hi> or <hi>worm:</hi> and like a <hi>potter,</hi> firſt ſhe divides her <hi>materials,</hi> and ſhe allots to the <hi>Trunk,</hi> the <hi>Head,</hi> and the <hi>Limbs,</hi> every one their <hi>ſhare</hi> or <hi>cantlin:</hi> as <hi>Painters</hi> do, who firſt draw the <hi>Lineaments,</hi> and then lay on the <hi>Colours:</hi> and as a <hi>Ship Carpenter,</hi> firſt layes the <hi>Keel</hi> for a <hi>foundation,</hi> and then ſets up the <hi>Ribs,</hi> and <hi>Breaſt-bone,</hi> or <hi>Deck:</hi> and as he builds a <hi>boat,</hi> ſo
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:56144:188"/>
doth <hi>Nature</hi> the Trunk of the Body, and haſp on the Joints. And in her work, ſhe begins all the <hi>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milary</hi> part out of the ſame Primitive <hi>gelly,</hi> or glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous <hi>maſs,</hi> (namely, the <hi>Bones, Griſtles, Fleſh, Nerves,</hi> &amp;c.) For at firſt there appears nothing of the <hi>Bones,</hi> but a kinde of <hi>filaments,</hi> or threddy <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres;</hi> which afterwards become <hi>nervous,</hi> anon <hi>Griſtles,</hi> after that, like <hi>thorns,</hi> and at laſt down right <hi>Bones.</hi> So likewiſe the thicker Membrane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſting the <hi>Brain,</hi> proceeds firſt to be <hi>griſtly,</hi> and afterwards into a <hi>Skull:</hi> while the thin Membrane doth improve into a <hi>Coat,</hi> or <hi>Pericranium,</hi> and <hi>Fleſh.</hi> And in the ſame Order the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>Nerves,</hi> out of a <hi>yeilding gelly,</hi> do <hi>concoct</hi> and <hi>ſtrengthen,</hi> into <hi>Muſcles, Tendons,</hi> and <hi>Ligaments:</hi> The <hi>braine,</hi> and <hi>after-braine,</hi> from a thin Water, coagulate into a <hi>Callous Curd;</hi> for the <hi>braine</hi> of <hi>Infants,</hi> before the <hi>bones</hi> of the <hi>Synciput</hi> are confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, appears ſoft and fluid, and hath no more coherence, then <hi>coagulated Milk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third Proceſs is of the <hi>Intrals;</hi> whoſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is diſcovered in the Chicken, after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineation of the body; (namely about the ſixth or ſeventh day) and neer upon the ſame time, they all appear, that is, the <hi>Liver, Lungs, Kidnies,</hi> the <hi>Cone</hi> of the <hi>Heart</hi> and its <hi>ventricles,</hi> and alſo the <hi>Guts.</hi> But their firſt original is from the Veines, and are bred growing to them, (like <hi>Wens</hi> to the barke of <hi>Trees)</hi> and at firſt they appear <hi>white, blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,</hi> and like a <hi>gelly;</hi> and ſo continue till they are ripe for publick imployment. The <hi>Guts</hi> with the <hi>Stomack</hi> ſeem at firſt like white threads, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or contorted, extended through the longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the <hi>belly:</hi> and together with them the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of the <hi>Mouth</hi> is diſcovered; from which to the <hi>Fundament</hi> in a continued proceſſion, the top
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:56144:188"/>
is <hi>united</hi> and <hi>linked</hi> to the <hi>bottom:</hi> the <hi>Genitals</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo are about this time viſible.</p>
            <p>Yet hitherto the Bowels and Guts are not ſhut up within the <hi>hollow</hi> of the <hi>body,</hi> but being faſtned as it were to the <hi>Veines</hi> hang forth: and thus doth even the <hi>Heart</hi> himſelf. For the <hi>trunk</hi> of the <hi>body</hi> hitherto reſembles a <hi>Skiff</hi> without a <hi>deck,</hi> or a <hi>Houſe</hi> without a <hi>roof;</hi> as being hitherto no way covered over by the <hi>anteriour parts;</hi> namely, the <hi>Breaſt,</hi> and <hi>Abdomen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſo ſoon as the <hi>Sternum,</hi> or <hi>breaſt-bone</hi> is fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the <hi>Heart</hi> enters into the <hi>breaſt,</hi> as into a <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation</hi> of his own ſetting up, and furniſhed pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely for him; and being now retired, like the <hi>Genius</hi> of the place, he undertakes the patronage of the whole Manſion; and there dwells, with his ſervants the <hi>Lungs.</hi> After this, the <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack</hi> retreat too; &amp; at laſt the Guts ſhrowd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Belly. So that in a Hen-egge after the tenth day of Incubation, the Heart admits no ſpectators without diſſection.</p>
            <p>About this time the top of the Bill, and the Claws break forth, being all exceeding white; and now a <hi>chylous</hi> matter is viſible in the <hi>Stomack,</hi> and a kind of Excrement in the Guts; and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver being now begun hath the Gall, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears green adjoined to it. By which it appears, that a different Concoction, and Preparation of the <hi>Aliment</hi> is now made, (whereof theſe are the Excrements, from that which is performed by the Propagations of the <hi>Umbilical Veſſels:</hi> ſo that a juſt doubt may hence ariſe, how <hi>Choler</hi> (the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement of the Second Concoction) can be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the reſt of the <hi>Humours</hi> by the <hi>Livers</hi> help, when it is it ſelf in being at the ſame time with the <hi>Liver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="334" facs="tcp:56144:189"/>
The Interiour parts are Univerſally generated, after the Order propoſed: for in all Animals (which I ever diffected) they are framed after the ſame Manner, and Order: and eſpecially in the more perfect, in Four-footed Beaſts, and ſo in Man himſelf; In whom the Heart, Liver, Lungs, Spleen, and Guts, appear framed, and augmented in the Second, Third, and Fourth Moneths, at which times they are white, as alſo the whole Body. And hereupon the <hi>firſt days</hi> are not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called <hi>in lacte dies,</hi> the Dayes in the Milk; for the Bowels, and all the other parts appeare <hi>ſpermatical,</hi> except onely the <hi>Veines,</hi> and chiefly thoſe of the <hi>Navel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Umbilical Arteries</hi> are, I conceive, framed after their Name-ſakes, the <hi>Veines;</hi> becauſe they are ſcarce to be found in the <hi>firſt moneths,</hi> and take their Original from the Branches which deſcend to the <hi>Thighes:</hi> And therefore, I conceive, they are not conſtituted before that part of the <hi>body,</hi> (from whence they are derived.) But the <hi>Umbili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Veines</hi> are conſpicuous long before any part of the Body is in hand.</p>
            <p>What I have now delivered, hath been ratified out of many <hi>diſſections</hi> of humane <hi>Embryo's</hi> of (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt) all ſizes: for I have obſerved them from the bigneſs of a <hi>Tad-pole,</hi> till they became of the longitude of <hi>ſeven</hi> or <hi>eight fingers</hi> breadth, and ſo upwards to the Birth. And eſpecially in the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, third,</hi> and <hi>fourth moneths;</hi> at which times the greateſt Alterations befall them, and the progreſs of Generation is moſt evident.</p>
            <p>Therefore, in a <hi>humane Embryo</hi> of <hi>two moneths</hi> old, thoſe very things which we have related in the <hi>ſecond Proceſs,</hi> do appear begun. For in the <hi>firſt moneth</hi> I conceive there is <hi>litle</hi> or <hi>nothing</hi> of the
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:56144:189"/>
               <hi>foetus</hi> extant in the womb; at leaſt I never found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing. But that moneth expiring, I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſeen a conception caſt out (like to that which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> relates to have fallen from the Minſtrell) of the bigneſs of a <hi>Pheaſants,</hi> or <hi>Pigeons egge,</hi> and it was of an <hi>Oval</hi> figure, juſt like an <hi>Egg</hi> with the <hi>Shell</hi> pilled off; but the thicker mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane (called <hi>Chorion)</hi> encompaſſing it, was plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered on the out ſide, as it were, with a <hi>mucous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> (eſpecially in the <hi>obtuſer end)</hi> but within it was <hi>ſlippery,</hi> being full of <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>ſtiff</hi> water, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining nothing elſe at all.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>ſecond moneth,</hi> I have often ſeen ſuch a kinde of <hi>Egg</hi> (but larger) ejected upon <hi>indications</hi> of <hi>Abortment,</hi> namely the <hi>Lochia ichoroſa;</hi> and it hath been ſometimes <hi>entire,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>broken,</hi> covered over with clotted <hi>blood.</hi> Within, it was <hi>ſmooth</hi> and <hi>ſlippery,</hi> the <hi>blood</hi> adhering without, and its form was like the other. In ſome of theſe eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I have found a <hi>foetus,</hi> in other, none. That <hi>foetus</hi> hath been of the <hi>length</hi> of the <hi>nail</hi> of the <hi>litle finger,</hi> but the ſhape was like a <hi>litle frog,</hi> ſave onely that the <hi>head</hi> was great, and the <hi>leggs</hi> extremly <hi>ſhort:</hi> juſt like the <hi>Tadpoles</hi> in <hi>June,</hi> which when their <hi>limbs</hi> begin to <hi>ſhoot</hi> out, they looſe their tail, and put on the <hi>ſhape</hi> of <hi>Frogs.</hi> All its ſubſtance was white, and ſo ſoft and gellyiſh, that unleſs it were caſt into clear water, you could not hold it in your hand. The face was like that of other <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals,</hi> as of a <hi>Dog,</hi> or <hi>Cat,</hi> without <hi>lips,</hi> and a <hi>wide mouth</hi> from one care to the other.</p>
            <p>Divers Women, whoſe <hi>Conception</hi> (like an addle <hi>Egge)</hi> is fruitleſs, and without a <hi>Foetus,</hi> do ſuffer <hi>abortion</hi> the third moneth. I have often diſſected an <hi>abortion</hi> of that <hi>age</hi> (being of the bigneſs of a <hi>Gooſe-egg)</hi> wherein was a <hi>foetus,</hi> diſtinct in all its
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:56144:190"/>
parts; though their form was rough, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhapen, The Head, Eyes, and Limbs appeared, but the <hi>Muſcles</hi> were confuſed: having no <hi>bones,</hi> but in their places, certain <hi>Lineaments,</hi> and ſofter <hi>Griſtles,</hi> as it were; the ſubſtance of the Heart was moſt white, having two <hi>Ventricles</hi> of equal magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and thickneſſe, and a double <hi>Cone,</hi> like two ſmall <hi>Twin-kernels</hi> of a <hi>Nut;</hi> the <hi>Liver</hi> was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous litle, and alſo white. All this time, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for three moneths ſpace <hi>Vix quicquam Placen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae, ſive hepatis Uterini,</hi> ſcarce any thing of the <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-burden</hi> is to be ſeen.</p>
            <p>In all theſe kinde of <hi>Conceptions</hi> (as many as I have ſeen) I ſtill found the <hi>ambient membrane</hi> fraught with a vaſt quantity of <hi>watry ſubſtance:</hi> in which the floating <hi>Embryo</hi> is ſo exceeding ſmall, compared with the <hi>place</hi> where his abode is, and hath withall ſo long and winding a <hi>Navel;</hi> that thoſe <hi>waters</hi> ought not upon any tearms to bee thought the <hi>ſweat,</hi> or <hi>Urine</hi> of the <hi>Embryo;</hi> but more probably, his <hi>nutriment,</hi> provided by nature (like the <hi>Colliquamentum</hi> in the <hi>Egge.)</hi> For I could finde no indication to induce me to believe, that that <hi>conception,</hi> or <hi>Egge</hi> had any connexion to the <hi>Womb:</hi> onely the outward <hi>ſuperficies</hi> of the <hi>obtuſer end,</hi> looked ſomething more wrinckled and thick; like the firſt intention of a future <hi>placen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover thoſe Conceptions appeared to mee, like certain <hi>egges,</hi> which were onely to be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured within the <hi>Womb,</hi> but to be nouriſhed (like the <hi>Henne-egge)</hi> by their owne <hi>projection,</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry.</p>
            <p>Now in the <hi>fourth moneth,</hi> you would admire how much the <hi>Foetus</hi> is improved; for by this, it is encreaſed from a <hi>Thumb-length</hi> to a <hi>Span:</hi> and
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:56144:190"/>
all his members appear <hi>diſtinct,</hi> and have a tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of <hi>Blood;</hi> the <hi>Muſcles</hi> of the <hi>Limbs,</hi> and the <hi>Bones</hi> are now apparent; and alſo the <hi>Rudiments</hi> of the <hi>Nailes;</hi> and the <hi>Embryo</hi> begins to beſtirre himſelf ſoundly. Yet the <hi>Head</hi> is ſtill very bigge; and the <hi>Face</hi> without <hi>Lips, Cheeks,</hi> or <hi>Noſe:</hi> the <hi>chaſm</hi> of the <hi>Mouth</hi> is very large, whoſe ſpace is half ſupplied by the <hi>Tongue;</hi> the <hi>Eyes</hi> ſmall, and without <hi>Lids;</hi> the middle part of the <hi>Fore-head,</hi> and all the upper-part of the <hi>Head</hi> is covered with a <hi>Membrane,</hi> which is not as yet <hi>cartilaginous,</hi> ſo far is it from being <hi>Boney:</hi> but the hinder part of the <hi>Head</hi> is ſomething hard, and <hi>Cartilaginous,</hi> implying that the <hi>Skull</hi> beginnes to grow ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Genitals</hi> likewiſe did appear, but the <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> were ſeated within the <hi>Abdomen</hi> (where in <hi>fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males</hi> the <hi>Uterus</hi> reſideth) the <hi>Scrotum</hi> remaining empty. The <hi>Feminine parts</hi> were imperfect, and the <hi>Uterus</hi> with its litle <hi>Tubuli,</hi> did repreſent <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam bicornem,</hi> the two horned ſhape of the <hi>Uterus</hi> of a <hi>Lamb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now the <hi>Placenta</hi> was enlarged, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to the <hi>Womb;</hi> comprehending almoſt halfe the <hi>Conception;</hi> appearing to my eye like a <hi>Tumor,</hi> or <hi>fleſhey excreſcence</hi> of the <hi>Womb:</hi> its <hi>Gibbous part</hi> did ſtick ſo faſt, even throughout its whole extent, to the <hi>Womb,</hi> which was now grown thicker. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this <hi>Placenta</hi> the litle <hi>Umbilical branches</hi> (like ſlender rootes into the Earth) did inſinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: and by its mediation the <hi>Conception</hi> was now firſt tyed to the <hi>Womb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The large and fluid <hi>Braine</hi> reſembled <hi>Cheeſe-Curd,</hi> and was embroidered with larger Veines. The two <hi>Ventricles</hi> of the <hi>Heart,</hi> both of the ſame magnitude, and their walls equally thick. In the
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:56144:191"/>
Region of the <hi>Breaſt</hi> within the <hi>Ribs,</hi> I ſaw three hollow places, and thoſe not much unlike each other: the loweſt of which, the <hi>Lungs</hi> having <hi>Blood</hi> in them, and of like complexion with the <hi>Liver</hi> and <hi>Kidnies,</hi> did inhabit: the middle was poſſeſſed by the <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Pericardium:</hi> but the upper was filled with that large <hi>Glandule</hi> which we call <hi>Thymus,</hi> the <hi>Sweet-Bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Stomack</hi> was <hi>Chyle,</hi> of like ſubſtance to that in which the <hi>Embryo</hi> ſwims: There was alſo a coagulated ſubſtance which was white, like to thoſe white curded pollutions which the <hi>Midwife</hi> waſheth off from the <hi>Infant</hi> (eſpecially from the foulds of the <hi>Skin)</hi> ſo ſoon as it is borne. In the ſuperiour <hi>Inteſtines</hi> was <hi>Excrement,</hi> or ſome part of the <hi>Chyle,</hi> in the inferiour a litle dark excrement. In the <hi>Bladder</hi> was <hi>Urine</hi> found: and <hi>Gall</hi> in the <hi>Veſicle</hi> deſigned for its reception. <hi>Inteſtinum Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> the <hi>blind Gut</hi> (juſt as it is in grown perſons) like an empty ſuperfluous appendix of the <hi>Colon;</hi> and nothing like what it is in other <hi>Animals,</hi> (as the <hi>Hogge,</hi> the <hi>Horſe,</hi> and the <hi>Hare)</hi> in which it is like a Second <hi>Stomack.</hi> The <hi>Omentum,</hi> or <hi>Kell,</hi> did like a <hi>Caule,</hi> or thin tranſparent cloud, lye floa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon the <hi>Guts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Reines</hi> at this time are not formed into a <hi>gibbous figure,</hi> as it is when men are grown, but are moulded of ſeveral <hi>gobbets</hi> (as you ſee in a <hi>Calfe,</hi> and in a <hi>Sturgeon)</hi> as if to every <hi>ſprig</hi> or <hi>divaricati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>Ureters,</hi> there were a <hi>gobbet</hi> or <hi>Teat,</hi> out of which their <hi>Orifices</hi> did draine the Urine. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Kidnies</hi> there are the two <hi>Glandules</hi> (which <hi>Euſtachius</hi> firſt found out) wherin ſtore of <hi>blood</hi> lies; and their Vein, which <hi>Anatomiſt</hi> call <hi>Adipoſe,</hi> ſeems not much leſs then the <hi>Emulgent</hi> it ſelf. The <hi>Liver,</hi> and <hi>Spleen,</hi> are equally full of <hi>blood</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:56144:191"/>
to their ſeveral proportions.)</p>
            <p>And here we muſt obſerve by the way, that in every <hi>Humane Foetus</hi> that is lively and well, perfect <hi>Milk</hi> is found; wherewith chiefly the <hi>Glandule Thymus,</hi> or the <hi>Sweet-bread</hi> is ſtored. It is alſo found in the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> and almoſt all along the <hi>Meſentery,</hi> in certain <hi>Venae Lacteae</hi> as it were, and the <hi>Glandules</hi> placed between the <hi>divarications</hi> of the <hi>Meſeraicke Veins.</hi> Nay ſometimes it may be milked out at the <hi>breaſts</hi> of <hi>New-borne Infants,</hi> and ſometimes alſo it ſtarts out of it ſelf: which ſome <hi>Midwives</hi> ſay, doth make for the <hi>Infants Health.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that it may plainly appear, that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (which is ſo plenteous in the <hi>Conception)</hi> is no excrement diſcharged by the <hi>Embryo,</hi> as either his Sweat, or Urine; it is leſſe (in proportion) neer the birth (when the <hi>foetus</hi> is now more grown, and upon that account doth accumulate more excrement, becauſe he requires more nouriſhment) then in the <hi>firſt moneths</hi> of <hi>pregnation.</hi> And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, at that time his <hi>bladder</hi> is full, and diſtended with Urine. And to ſay truth, that paſſage, (which <hi>Anatomiſts</hi> call the <hi>Urachus)</hi> which ſhould (as they phanſie) convey the <hi>Urine</hi> from the <hi>blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> through the <hi>Navel,</hi> could never yet be found out: but I have often ſeen the <hi>bladder,</hi> preſſed or griped with the hand, diſcharge the Urine out at the Yard, but never at the <hi>Urachus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let this ſuffice, concerning what we have obſerved in a <hi>humane Foetus,</hi> ſo farre forth as it relates to the knowledge of the Order of the Parts.</p>
            <p>In the Fourth and laſt Proceſs, the parts of meaner rank and condition are formed: ſuch as do not ſimply relate to the very being, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Animal, but onely <hi>ad tutelam,</hi> to
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:56144:192"/>
its ſafe-guard againſt forreign injuries: or <hi>ad or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natum, vel pugnam,</hi> to its Ornament, or for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p>For that kind of <hi>Safe-guard</hi> or <hi>Defence,</hi> the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt part (namely the <hi>Skin)</hi> is chiefly conſtituted, and all that proceeds out of it, as the <hi>Scarfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin,</hi> the <hi>Haire, Wool, Plumes, Scales, Shells, Clans, Hoofs,</hi> and the like. And indeed it is a prudent contrivance of <hi>Nature</hi> (who never makes any thing indiſcreetly,) to beget thoſe parts laſt of all, whereof ſhe hath no uſe till after nativity. And therefore the <hi>Chicken</hi> is borne with down onely on him, and not Feathers (as other <hi>Birds</hi> are, who are preſently fitted for <hi>flight)</hi> becauſe by wandring to and fro, he earns his ſuſtenance with the induſtry of his <hi>Legs,</hi> rather then his <hi>Wings:</hi> And ſo again young <hi>Ducklins,</hi> and <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins,</hi> who prey in the water, have their <hi>Plumes,</hi> and <hi>Wings</hi> later perfected then their <hi>Legs:</hi> which is clean contrary in young <hi>Swallows,</hi> which, becauſe they are to fly about to glean up a living, are ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner verſed in flight, then walking.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Down</hi> ſtarts up in the Chicken after the Fourteenth day, when the <hi>Foetus</hi> is now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, and provided with all his parts. But in many of them, at their firſt nativity, it lookes like <hi>dark ſpots</hi> or <hi>points;</hi> and after that the Feathers ſprout up like Graſſe in the Field, and at laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiate, and cloath the body round, protecting it from the inclemency of the Aire.</p>
            <p>The Feathers differ from Quills, in form, uſe, and place of Production. For Chickens are Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered ere they have <hi>Quills:</hi> for <hi>Quills</hi> ſpring on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their <hi>Wings,</hi> and <hi>Rump;</hi> and ſtick deeper in the bottome of the fleſh, or the very <hi>Perioſtium</hi> it ſelf, and are uſeful to <hi>motion:</hi> but the Feathers
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:56144:192"/>
riſe out of the ſuperficies of the <hi>Skinn,</hi> and ſerve for protection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nailes, Hair, Hornes,</hi> and the like, ſaith <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi>

               <hi>are bred out of the Fleſh, in ſo much that they change colour with the Fleſh: for the white, and black, and diverſe coloured, are made ſo, according to the different complexion of the Skin.</hi> But in our <hi>Chicken,</hi> all this is clean otherwiſe, for what various co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour ſoever the <hi>Feathers</hi> be of, the Skin beneath them is of one onely.

            </p>
            <p>Likewiſe in the <hi>Humane Foetus,</hi> the <hi>Cutis</hi> and all the skinny <hi>parts</hi> are laſt perfected.

            <p>The Ornaments, as the <hi>Tuft</hi> upon the <hi>Head,</hi> the <hi>Comb,</hi> the <hi>Gills</hi> and the like, wherewith the haughty <hi>Animals</hi> ſwagger, are for the moſt part imparted to the <hi>male,</hi> more then the <hi>female:</hi> as alſo all <hi>weapons</hi> too, as <hi>Teeth, Hornes,</hi> and <hi>Spurs,</hi> &amp;c. which appoints them for the <hi>Battail.</hi> And they are then

            <head>Certain Paradoxes, and Problemes to be conſidered of, concerning this Subject.</head>
            <head>EXEECIT. LVII.</head>
            <p>THus far have we ſpoken concerning the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Generation:</hi> by which the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe creatures which are produced by a <hi>Metamorphoſis,</hi> and thoſe which are borne by an <hi>Epigeneſis,</hi> hath been diſcovered: as alſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe that ſpring from a <hi>Worme,</hi> and thoſe that ariſe from an <hi>Egge:</hi> for theſe are bodied out of one part of the prepared <hi>matter,</hi> and fed with the other; But they take up the whole <hi>matter</hi> in their frame, or <hi>Conſtitution:</hi> theſe are together aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and formed; they are <hi>augmented</hi> firſt, and from a <hi>Canker-Worme</hi> grow into an <hi>Aurelia,</hi> and are afterwards formed and made conſummate <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals,</hi> as <hi>Butterflies, Silk-wormes,</hi> and ſuch like <hi>Animals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (as <hi>Fabricius</hi> obſerves) <hi>as he conſtitutes a kind of twofold nature of the egge, and a kind of twofold Egge in theſe creatures; ſo he laies down a twofold action, and a twofold Animal produced by it. For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>out of the firſt egges, which are the firſt rudiments of the Generation, a Worm conſtantly doth proceed: namely, out of the Egges of Files, Ants, Bees, Silk-wormes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in which a certain fluid matter is conteined, and out of all that fluid matter is the Worme made. But out of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Egges, which are layed by the Worm himſelfe, the Butterflie is born, and proceeds; that is, a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile</hi>
               <pb n="344" facs="tcp:56144:194"/>
               <hi>Animal, which is concluded in a kind of Shell, Skin, little bag, or egge, and when that bag is broken it departs thence as</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>delivereth concerning the Locuſts egges.</hi> Laſtly theſe are perfected by a <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> of <hi>parts;</hi> but they (namely, ſuch as are generated by a <hi>Metamorphoſis)</hi> are made intire at once. And in the ſame manner, are both <hi>Sponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous productions</hi> generated, which obtain their firſt matter, and firſt extraction from <hi>putrefaction, filth, dew, excrements,</hi> or out of the <hi>parts</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> or <hi>Animals;</hi> as alſo thoſe <hi>iſſues</hi> which proceed from the ſeed of <hi>Univocal Animals.</hi> For it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all <hi>Animals,</hi> to deſume their <hi>Original</hi> from <hi>ſeed,</hi> or an <hi>egge:</hi> whether that <hi>ſeed</hi> proceed from other <hi>Animals</hi> of the ſame <hi>ſpecies,</hi> or happen there caſually from ſome thing elſe. For as it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times befalls in <hi>Art,</hi> ſo alſo in <hi>Nature;</hi> namely, that the ſame things are ſometimes <hi>caſuall,</hi> which at other times are effected by <hi>Art:</hi> as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> doth inſtance in <hi>Health,</hi> ſo in like manner is the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of any <hi>Animals;</hi> (as far as they proceed from <hi>Seed)</hi> whether their ſeed be <hi>caſuall,</hi> or elſe proceed from an <hi>Univocal Agent</hi> of the ſame kind. For even in <hi>caſuall ſeed,</hi> there is a <hi>motive principle</hi> of <hi>Generation,</hi> which can generate out of it ſelf, and by it ſelf: and the ſame thing is found in it, as in <hi>Univocal Animals;</hi> namely, a power to form a <hi>living creature.</hi> But of this more at large here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>Now ſome Paradoxes do here ariſe to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. For ſince the <hi>Macula</hi> is dilated, the <hi>Colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quamentum</hi> concocted, and prepared, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things (not without great providence) orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, towards the formation, and growth of the <hi>Chicken,</hi> before any particle of the <hi>Chicken</hi> appear; what ſhould hinder the <hi>Innate beat,</hi> and <hi>vegetative</hi>
               <pb n="345" facs="tcp:56144:194"/>
               <hi>ſoul</hi> of the <hi>Chicken</hi> to be exiſtent before the <hi>Chicken</hi> it ſelf? For what can produce the effects and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of <hi>Life,</hi> but that which is the <hi>cauſe</hi> and <hi>efficient</hi> of thoſe <hi>Effects</hi> and <hi>Operations;</hi> namely, the <hi>heat,</hi> and <hi>faculty</hi> of the <hi>Vegetal ſoul?</hi> And therefore the <hi>ſoul</hi> doth not ſeem to be <hi>Actus corporis Organici vitam habentis in potentiâ,</hi> the <hi>Act</hi> of an <hi>Organical body,</hi> which hath <hi>life</hi> in it <hi>in potentiâ:</hi> for we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>form</hi> of the <hi>Chicken</hi> to be ſuch an Act. Now in what can we imagine the <hi>form,</hi> or <hi>ſoul</hi> of the <hi>Chicken</hi> to be, but in the <hi>Chicken</hi> it ſelf? un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we allow the <hi>forms</hi> to be ſeparate, or grant a <hi>Metempſychôſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is moſt manifeſt, where the ſame <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> lives by a ſucceſſion of forms; (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaks) as for example, <hi>Out of a Canker-worm, an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relia, and then a Butterfly.</hi> For the ſame <hi>Efficient, Nutritive,</hi> and <hi>Preſerving principle,</hi> muſt needs be in each of theſe: unleſs we will place one ſoul in the <hi>Boy,</hi> another in the <hi>Young man,</hi> and a third in the <hi>Old:</hi> or affirm, that the Canker-worm, and that worm which becomes a Silk-worm, alſo the Silk-worm, and the Butterfly, have the ſame form, of which matter <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath accurately written, and whereof more largely hereafter.</p>
            <p>Again, it ſeems a <hi>Paradox,</hi> that the <hi>blood</hi> ſhould be made, and move, and be endowed with <hi>Vital ſpirits,</hi> before any ſanguifying, or <hi>Motive Organs</hi> are conſtituted at all.</p>
            <p>Nor is it leſs new and unheard of, that there ſhould be <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> in the <hi>Foetus,</hi> before his <hi>brain</hi> is made; for the <hi>Foetus moves, contracts,</hi> and <hi>extends</hi> himſelf, when there is nothing yet appears for a <hi>brain,</hi> but clear <hi>water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, the <hi>body</hi> is nouriſhed and encreaſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Organs</hi> dedicated to Concoction (namely
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:56144:195"/>
the <hi>Stomack</hi> and <hi>Liver)</hi> are formed. And likewiſe <hi>Sanguification</hi> (which is the ſecond <hi>Concoction)</hi> is performed before the firſt, (which is by the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack)</hi> and called <hi>Chylification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Excrements of the firſt and ſecond <hi>Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> (namely in the <hi>Guts,</hi> and the two <hi>bladders,</hi> of <hi>Urine</hi> one, the other of <hi>Gall)</hi> are coetaneous to the <hi>concocting Inſtruments</hi> themſelves. Laſtly, there is a <hi>Minde, Providence,</hi> and <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the <hi>Vegetal part</hi> of the <hi>ſoul,</hi> but even before the <hi>ſoul</hi> it ſelf; procuring, diſpoſing, and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things, and artificially molding the future <hi>foetus</hi> to a reſemblance with his parents, even from the very firſt <hi>original;</hi> and all this, to advance the being, and well being of the <hi>Foetus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning which <hi>Reſemblance,</hi> we may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, what ſhould be the cauſe why the <hi>Foetus</hi> ſometimes reſembles the <hi>Father,</hi> ſometimes the <hi>Mother,</hi> and ſometimes alſo the <hi>Progenitors,</hi> and thoſe either of the <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Mothers</hi> ſide? And this the rather, ſince upon one ſingle <hi>coition,</hi> and at the ſame moment of time, many <hi>Egges</hi> are fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified together. This alſo is a wonderful thing, that the <hi>Virtues,</hi> and <hi>Vices,</hi> the <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> the <hi>Marks,</hi> the <hi>Moles</hi> or <hi>Spots</hi> ſhould be transferred to Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and that into ſome onely of the <hi>Progeny,</hi> and not unto all. In the race of <hi>Cocks,</hi> ſome are of a generous <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and born to <hi>battle;</hi> who will dye rather then turn their backs upon their Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: and yet their <hi>Nephews,</hi> unleſs they proceed of like parents, do by degrees forfeit their <hi>galan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;</hi> according to that ſaying, <hi>Fortes creantur for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus.</hi> In many other <hi>Animals</hi> (and eſpecially in <hi>Man)</hi> the Bravery of the Succeſſion, or <hi>Family</hi> is obſervable: and many of the Indowments both of <hi>body</hi> and <hi>ſoul</hi> are derived down to it <hi>ex traduce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="347" facs="tcp:56144:195"/>
This I have often admired, that when the Iſſue hath obtained a mixt <hi>fabrick</hi> or compoſition from both Parents, and that in all other parts of the <hi>body,</hi> yet it hath not been ſo in the <hi>Genitals;</hi> but that it commonly proves either <hi>Male,</hi> or <hi>Female,</hi> and very ſeldom an <hi>Hermaphrodite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, many things are in the <hi>foetus</hi> ere they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at all; and ſome things are begun with the <hi>firſt,</hi> but perfected with the <hi>laſt:</hi> as the <hi>Eyes, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitals,</hi> and <hi>Bill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And hence there ariſe debates concerning the pre-eminence, or dignity of the <hi>Parts;</hi> in which the Wits of ſuch as are curious in theſe caſes, may imploy themſelves. As, Whether the <hi>Heart</hi> beſtow <hi>life</hi> and vigour upon the <hi>blood,</hi> or the <hi>blood</hi> rather upon the <hi>Heart?</hi> Whether the <hi>blood</hi> be made for the <hi>bodyes</hi> ſake, as the <hi>Matter, Nutriment,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument;</hi> or elſe the <hi>body,</hi> and all its <hi>parts</hi> for the <hi>blood,</hi> and the <hi>ſoul</hi> which doth <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>principally</hi> reſide in it? Likewiſe, Whether the <hi>Ventricles,</hi> or <hi>Auricles</hi> of the <hi>Heart</hi> are moſt honourable? For we finde that the <hi>Auricles</hi> have <hi>life</hi> and <hi>pulſe</hi> firſt, and do <hi>expire</hi> laſt. And farther, Whether the <hi>left Ventricle</hi> of the <hi>Heart,</hi> which is deeper in a <hi>Man,</hi> and is fenced with a thicker and more carnous wall, and is conceived to be the <hi>fountain</hi> of the <hi>Spirts,</hi> be the more <hi>excellent, hotter,</hi> more <hi>fraught</hi> with <hi>Spirits,</hi> and <hi>livelyer</hi> of the two: or the <hi>Right,</hi> which doth <hi>laſt</hi> languiſh and ſubſcribe to Death, containing a large quantity of <hi>blood:</hi> and where the Dying mans <hi>blood</hi> doth <hi>laſt</hi> congeal, and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of <hi>life</hi> and <hi>ſpirit?</hi> and whether alſo the <hi>Umbilical Veſſels</hi> do tranſport the <hi>blood</hi> (as to their <hi>fountain)</hi> and whence alſo they derive their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction?</p>
            <p>Now theſe things do reſult out of the <hi>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
               <pb n="348" facs="tcp:56144:196"/>
of the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Generation</hi> of the <hi>Parts,</hi> as alſo other things which may be hence deduced, and do not a litle claſh againſt the <hi>Phyſiology</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly approved. Namely, (when we plainly ſee that there is both <hi>Senſe</hi> &amp; <hi>Motion,</hi> before the <hi>brain</hi> is begotten) it is evident that all <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> is not derived from the <hi>brain:</hi> for it appeares by our <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> that <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> do clearly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover themſelves in the <hi>firſt ſmall drop</hi> of <hi>blood</hi> in the <hi>Egge,</hi> before any <hi>particle</hi> of the <hi>body</hi> is framed. And likewiſe, the firſt platform or conſtitution (which we call <hi>gelly)</hi> is laid before any part is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; and when the <hi>brain</hi> is now nothing but a clear water: which firſt rudiment of the Body, if it be lightly pricked, will, like a <hi>Worm</hi> or <hi>Magot,</hi> obſcurely move, and contract it ſelf: which is a plain teſtimony of its <hi>ſenſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are alſo other Arguments deduced from <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> by which we may conclude (with <hi>Ariſtotle)</hi> That the <hi>Heart,</hi> and not (with <hi>Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans)</hi> that the <hi>Brain</hi> is the firſt <hi>Principle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe <hi>Motions</hi> and <hi>Actions,</hi> which <hi>Phyſitians</hi> call <hi>Natural,</hi> becauſe they proceed whether we will or no; and we cannot moderate, accelerate, retard, or refrain them at our own pleaſure: &amp; which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are Independent in regard of the <hi>brain;</hi> yet even they are not performed without all <hi>ſenſe,</hi> but do imply <hi>ſenſe,</hi> as by which they are excited, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, and altered. For we conceive, that in the <hi>Heart</hi> it ſelf, its <hi>Palpitation, Trembling, Fainting, Sowning,</hi> and all the changes in the <hi>pulſe,</hi> either in <hi>magnitude, celerity, order, rhythme,</hi> or the like, do proceed from <hi>morbifical cauſes</hi> indiſpoſing it, and <hi>offenſive</hi> to its <hi>ſenſe.</hi> For whatſoever by diverſity of <hi>motions</hi> makes warre againſt thoſe things that enrage and moleſt it, muſt needs be indowed with <hi>ſenſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="349" facs="tcp:56144:196"/>
The <hi>Stomack</hi> and <hi>Guts</hi> provoked by injurious humours, do raiſe a <hi>Nauſeating, Belching, Rumbling, Vomiting,</hi> and <hi>Flux;</hi> and as it is beyond our power, either to raiſe or lay theſe combuſtions, ſo are we to ſeek for any ſuch <hi>ſenſe</hi> retaining to the <hi>brain,</hi> which ſhould excite thoſe parts to ſuch <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is very ſtrange, that upon the <hi>Infuſion</hi> of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> taken in a <hi>Vomit,</hi> though we neither diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it by taſte, nor finde any diſguſt in it, either ſwallowing it down, or in returning it back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; yet there paſſeth a cenſure upon it by the <hi>Stomack,</hi> which diſcerns between what is uſefull and prejudicial, and ſo provokes to <hi>Vomit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, the <hi>Fleſh</hi> it ſelf doth eaſily diſtinguiſh a <hi>poiſonous wound</hi> from one that is not <hi>poiſonous;</hi> and thereupon contracts it ſelf, and condenſeth; upon which enflamed <hi>tumours</hi> ariſe: as we may ſee in the ſtingings of the <hi>Bee,</hi> the <hi>Gnat,</hi> and the <hi>Spider.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I my ſelfe once, for experiment ſake, pricked my <hi>hand</hi> with a <hi>needle;</hi> and preſently rubbing the ſame needle upon a <hi>Spiders tooth,</hi> I pricked my <hi>hand</hi> in another place, ſo that <hi>I my ſelf</hi> could not diſtinguiſh between the two pricks. But there was ſomething in my <hi>Skin</hi> that did diſtinguiſh; for in that place where the <hi>poiſoned</hi> prick fell, it preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contracted it ſelf into a <hi>pimple,</hi> and preſently grew red, hot, and inflamed; as if it fortified it ſelf, and ſtood upon its <hi>guard,</hi> to oppoſe, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the malice of the <hi>Venom.</hi>

ſeem any way to be porovked, or heightened into any <hi>motion,</hi> or <hi>action.</hi> Nor have we any other ſigns to diſtinguiſh an <hi>animate</hi> and <hi>ſenſitive</hi> creature, from a <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>ſenſeleſs</hi> one, then by its <hi>motion</hi> provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked from ſome offenſive object, which doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies follow, and argue <hi>Senſe.</hi>

            <p>But of this more at large, when we treat of the <hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>Uſe</hi> of the <hi>Brain.</hi> But the Reverence due to the <hi>Antients,</hi> and <hi>Antiquity</hi> her ſelf, doth adviſe us to uphold their <hi>doctrines,</hi> ſo farre as they are <hi>true.</hi> Nor can it beſeem us raſhly to reject, and diſcountenance their <hi>Labours,</hi> and <hi>Decrees,</hi> whoſe light hath been our direction to the Shrines of <hi>Philoſophy;</hi> wherefore I conceive we ought to think thus. We perceive we have <hi>Five Senſes,</hi> by which we give <hi>judgement</hi> upon outward things; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not the ſame <hi>ſenſe,</hi> by which we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and by which we perceive our own <hi>percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> (for we ſee with our <hi>Eyes,</hi> but we do not by them <hi>know</hi> we ſee) but by another <hi>ſenſe,</hi> which em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployes another <hi>ſenſitive Organ</hi> (namely, the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Common ſenſe)</hi> by which we give <hi>judgement</hi> upon all thoſe things which we perceive by our <hi>external Organs,</hi> and ſo diſtinguiſh <hi>white</hi> from <hi>ſweet,</hi> and <hi>hard:</hi> This common <hi>Senſorium,</hi> or <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan of Senſe</hi> (whither all <hi>Species</hi> are conveyed from the outward <hi>Organs)</hi> is plainly the <hi>Head;</hi> which, together with all his <hi>Nerves,</hi> and outward <hi>Organs</hi> adjoined to them, is underſtood to be the adequate <hi>Organ</hi> of <hi>Senſation.</hi> And it is like the <hi>Senſitive Root,</hi> from which ſeveral <hi>Fibers</hi> reſult; whereof one <hi>ſees,</hi> another <hi>hears,</hi> a third <hi>toucheth,</hi> and the other <hi>ſmell,</hi> and <hi>taſte.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet as there are certain <hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>Motions,</hi> whoſe Regiment or Juriſdiction relates not to the <hi>Brain,</hi> and they therefore are called <hi>Natural:</hi>
               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:56144:197"/>
ſo alſo muſt we conclude, that there is a certain <hi>ſenſe</hi> of <hi>Touching,</hi> which is not conveyed to the <hi>Common ſenſe,</hi> or any way communicated to the <hi>brain;</hi> and therefore in that kinde of <hi>ſenſe,</hi> we do not <hi>perceive</hi> our <hi>ſenſation:</hi> but juſt like <hi>men</hi> whoſe <hi>underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is <hi>perverted,</hi> or elſe are diſtracted by ſome vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Paſſion,</hi> inſomuch that they are inſenſible of all <hi>pain,</hi> and takes no notice of any thing that meets their <hi>ſenſes:</hi> So we muſt conceive it to be in this <hi>ſenſe,</hi> which we therefore diſtinguiſh from <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſenſe.</hi> Having obſerved ſuch a kinde of <hi>ſenſe</hi> in the <hi>Zoophyta,</hi> or <hi>Plant-Animals</hi> (as the <hi>Senſitive Plant, Sponges,</hi> and the like.)</p>
            <p>Wherefore, as many <hi>Animals</hi> have both <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> without the <hi>Common ſenſe,</hi> or a <hi>brain;</hi> as the <hi>Worms</hi> in the <hi>Guts,</hi> alſo thoſe <hi>Worms</hi> which turn into <hi>Silk-worms,</hi> and the like, ſo alſo do ſome actions befall the <hi>Embryo,</hi> and us alſo without any aſſiſtance from the <hi>brain,</hi> and a kinde of <hi>ſenſation</hi> doth proceed, without <hi>ſenſe.</hi> And as <hi>Phyſitians</hi> teach, that <hi>Natural Actions</hi> differ from <hi>Animal;</hi> ſo upon like reaſon, the <hi>Natural Touch</hi> ſeems to differ from the <hi>Animal ſenſe</hi> of <hi>Touching,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a diſtinct <hi>ſpecies</hi> of <hi>Feeling:</hi> ſo that the one is communicated to the <hi>Common ſenſe,</hi> or <hi>brain,</hi> and the other not.</p>
            <p>Moreover, it is one thing for a <hi>Muſcle</hi> to be <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> or <hi>contracted,</hi> and another thing for it to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form an <hi>Action,</hi> at <hi>diſtinct regulated contractions</hi> and <hi>relaxations;</hi> as to <hi>go</hi> forward, or receive any thing in the <hi>hands.</hi> Doubtleſs, the <hi>Muſcles,</hi> or <hi>Motory Organs,</hi> in the <hi>Cynical diſtortion,</hi> or <hi>Convulſion</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from ſome cauſe that diſturbs them, are no otherwiſe moved, then a <hi>Cock</hi> or <hi>Hen,</hi> which when the <hi>Head</hi> is quite chopped off, is diſturbed with many <hi>convulſive motions</hi> of the <hi>Leggs</hi> and <hi>Wings:</hi> but

ſuch as are altogether confuſed, and diſordered, becauſe the ſway of the <hi>brain</hi> is dethroned, and the <hi>common ſenſe</hi> depoſed, under whoſe <hi>Government</hi> formerly, thoſe motions were regulated by <hi>rhythm</hi> and <hi>harmony,</hi> either to <hi>walking,</hi> or <hi>flight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We conceive therefore, that it ought to be ſaid, That all <hi>Natural Motions</hi> proceed from the power of the <hi>Heart,</hi> and are as his Retinue: but the <hi>Spontaneous,</hi> and ſuch as perfect any <hi>Action,</hi> (which <hi>Phyſitians</hi> call <hi>animal)</hi> are not produced but by the <hi>brain</hi> and <hi>common ſenſe</hi> controuling them. For as by this <hi>common ſenſe,</hi> we perceive our own <hi>Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> ſo alſo we perceive our own <hi>motion;</hi> and that whether it be regular, or perverſe.</p>
            <p>We have a clear Inſtance of both theſe <hi>motions</hi> in <hi>Reſpiration;</hi> for the <hi>Lungs</hi> (as the <hi>Heart)</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually moved up and down by a <hi>natural motion,</hi> and alſo provoked to cough, and frequent <hi>Agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> but produce or ſhape a <hi>voice,</hi> or ſing they cannot, without help, and commiſſion from <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>All in general acknowledge, that the <hi>Foetus</hi> while he abides in the <hi>Womb</hi> doth wallow in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of <hi>Water,</hi> (which <hi>Liquor,</hi> we, in the <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory</hi> of the <hi>Egge,</hi> ſtile the <hi>Colliquamentum,</hi> and the

            <p>
               <hi>Fabricius</hi> adjoines other benefits ariſing from <note place="margin">pag. 137.</note> theſe <hi>Waters;</hi> namely, <hi>Their moiſtning and lubrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the paſſages round about, and rendering the neck of the</hi> Matrix <hi>capable of the largeſt dilatation; and all theſe commodities,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>do no leſs ariſe from that thick white Excrement, anſwerable to that of the third concoction, which is Unciuous, Oily, and Fat, and neglected by the Ancients.

            </p>
            <p>I willingly acknowledge the ſeveral benefits aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to this water, by all Writers; namely, that the tender <hi>Foetus</hi> in order to his indemnity from any ſuddain, and violent motions of his <hi>Mother,</hi> is thus ſecurely neſtled in <hi>alis veſpertilionum,</hi> in the <hi>Bats Wings,</hi> as they call them, and moated round with ſtore of <hi>water,</hi> ſo that he cannot eaſily, by every (though violent) motion daſh himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his <hi>Mothers ſides;</hi> (becauſe of thoſe tyes which faſten him on every ſide) at leaſt this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumambient <hi>liquor</hi> being equally poiſed in the midſt doth protect him from all outward harme. But my own Obſervations, as they do in many other matters, ſo alſo in this enforce me to be of a contrary <hi>opinion</hi> to <hi>Fabricius:</hi> for I am moſt certain, that the ſaid <hi>liquor,</hi> is not the <hi>Sweat</hi> of
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:56144:199"/>
the <hi>Foetus.</hi> Nor can I believe, that that <hi>water</hi> doth perform thoſe offices in the <hi>birth,</hi> which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorates: and much leſſe, that it is ſo ſharp and <hi>Briney,</hi> that the <hi>foetus</hi> muſt ſtand in need of an oily unctuous fence to ſecure him from it, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially that <hi>foetus,</hi> which is either cloathed with <hi>Wool, Hair,</hi> or <hi>Feathers.</hi> For this <hi>liquor</hi> is of a good ſavour, and like a kind of watry Milk; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, almoſt all <hi>Viviparous Animals,</hi> ſo ſoon as they have brought their <hi>Young</hi> into the world, fall abord and eat it up, and lick their new born <hi>iſſues</hi> clean, greedily ſwallowing the humour which they receive in, when they will not ſo much as touch the <hi>excrements</hi> of their <hi>foetus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fabricius</hi> conceived this <hi>water</hi> to be <hi>ſharp,</hi> and <hi>ſalt,</hi> becauſe he thought it to be the <hi>ſweat.</hi> But what injury, I pray, can the <hi>ſweat</hi> do to the <hi>foetus</hi> now cloathed in <hi>feathers?</hi> if at leaſt he ever ſaw ſuch a creature as a <hi>ſweating Chicken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I ſuppoſe he will not ſay, that the uſe of that <hi>water</hi> in an <hi>egge,</hi> is by its <hi>moiſture</hi> and <hi>lubricity</hi> to expedite the <hi>Chickens birth.</hi> For the dryer and older the <hi>ſhell</hi> is, by ſo much the frailer, and brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler it becomes. Laſtly, were it the <hi>Chickens ſweat,</hi> it would moſt abound neer the <hi>Excluſion;</hi> for the larger the <hi>Chicken</hi> is, and the more <hi>Aliment</hi> he takes in, ſo much the more <hi>ſweat</hi> muſt he neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily create. But a litle before his <hi>Excluſion</hi> (about the <hi>ninteenth</hi> or <hi>twentieth day)</hi> there is none of this kind of <hi>humour</hi> diſcernable; whereby, he ſhould have rather reputed it an <hi>Aliment,</hi> then an <hi>Excrement:</hi> (had he rightly conſidered the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) eſpecially, ſeeing he allows the <hi>Chicken</hi> in the <hi>Egge,</hi> the uſe of <hi>Reſpiration, Voice,</hi> and <hi>Crying,</hi> which, were he begirt with water, could not have been.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="356" facs="tcp:56144:200"/>
Nor are theſe <hi>Waters</hi> of any great uſe, to the <hi>Expedition,</hi> or <hi>Lubricity</hi> of the <hi>Delivery</hi> (as experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced <hi>Midwives</hi> know full well) though <hi>Fabrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> would have it otherwiſe. For the neighbour <hi>Parts</hi> are about that time, (without any profuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe <hi>Waters,</hi> mellow and relaxed by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain maturity of their owne: eſpecially, thoſe which may be an obſtruction to the work: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>Oſſa pubis, &amp; Coccygis;</hi> about which the chiefeſt care of the <hi>Midwife</hi> is exerciſed in further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>delivery:</hi> for ſhe is leſs ſolicitous, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint the <hi>fleſhey parts,</hi> leaſt they rend in ſunder, then in putting back the <hi>Coccyx;</hi> which if ſhe cannot effect with her own hand, ſhe calls in the <hi>Man-Midwife</hi> to procure her purpoſe by the <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum matricis;</hi> which inſtrument by its triple ſides, whereof one is applyed to the <hi>Coccyx,</hi> the other two to the <hi>Oſſa pubis,</hi> doth diſtend thoſe parts by force.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Infant</hi> now juſt at his Birth, while hee turnes himſelf, and precipitates his <hi>Head</hi> down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, doth relax and open the orifice of the <hi>Womb:</hi> but if in his deſcent he light upon the top of the <hi>Bone,</hi> there he ſticks; and hardly gets forth, and that not without danger, to himſelf, and his Mother too. Now it is evidently natures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, to mollifie and relax thoſe parts. For, if the <hi>Midwife</hi> do diſcover the <hi>Orifice</hi> of the <hi>Matrix</hi> become ſoft and looſe, ſhe laies it down for an infallible ſign of the approaching <hi>delivery,</hi> though the <hi>Waters</hi> are not yet broken. Nay (I ſpeak what I know by <hi>Experience)</hi> in caſe any thing remaine after the <hi>delivery,</hi> which ought to be diſcharged, or if at any other time there be any thing in the <hi>Womb,</hi> which it indeavours to be rid of, the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> doth not onely deſcend, but is alſo ſoft and
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:56144:200"/>
relaxed: but if after the <hi>delivery,</hi> that <hi>Orifice</hi> be reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into its place, and be perceived to be grown ſomething hard, it is an evident ſign that all is wel.</p>
            <p>And by the like <hi>Experience,</hi> I pronounce, the <hi>Ossa pubis</hi> to be often looſened one from another in <hi>delivery,</hi> their <hi>cartilaginous</hi> connexion being mollified, and all the <hi>Region</hi> of the <hi>Lower Belly</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly dilated; and this not by the profuſion of the <hi>Watry ſubſtance,</hi> but of their own accord, as ripe <hi>fruits</hi> uſe to revolt or open, to make room for the <hi>Excluſion</hi> of their <hi>ſeeds.</hi> But how much the <hi>Coccyx</hi> may retard the <hi>delivery,</hi> is clear in <hi>four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed beaſts,</hi> that have <hi>Tailes;</hi> for they can neither <hi>bring forth young,</hi> nor diſload the <hi>excrements</hi> of the <hi>Guts,</hi> unleſs they remove their <hi>Taile;</hi> which if you depreſs with your <hi>hand,</hi> you hinder the paſſage of the <hi>Excrement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, that is accounted the moſt <hi>Natural Delivery,</hi> when the <hi>Foetus</hi> and <hi>Secundines</hi> with the <hi>Watry ſubſtance</hi> (that is, the <hi>Entire Egge)</hi> get forth together. For if the <hi>Secundines</hi> be entire, and the <hi>waters</hi> not broken, the circumjacent <hi>parts</hi> are more diſtended, &amp; dilated by the <hi>Throwes,</hi> namely, by the diſtention of the <hi>Membranes,</hi> whereupon, the <hi>foetus</hi> works his releaſe with leſs ſtruggling; though the <hi>Mothers paines</hi> be the greater. In which conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we know how the <hi>Woman in Labour</hi> is much relieved from the intollerable <hi>torment</hi> cauſed by <hi>diſtention,</hi> upon the breaking of the <hi>Membranes,</hi> (whether it be done by <hi>Midwives</hi> nailes, or by a pair of Sciſſors) the <hi>Waters</hi> by that means being ſet a float.</p>
            <p>And the skilful <hi>Midwives</hi> know very well, that in caſe all the <hi>Waters</hi> be come away, before the <hi>natural opening</hi> of the <hi>Womb,</hi> the <hi>Woman with Child,</hi> continueth the longer in <hi>Labour,</hi> and her <hi>Travail</hi>
               <pb n="358" facs="tcp:56144:201"/>
is the harder; which would yet be contrary, in caſe thoſe precedent <hi>Waters</hi> (as <hi>Fabricius</hi> would have it) did ſo much conduce to the <hi>mollifying,</hi> and <hi>Lubricity</hi> of the <hi>parts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides that this humour, which we call the <hi>Colliquamentum,</hi> is not the <hi>ſweat</hi> of the <hi>foetus,</hi> is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, both in the <hi>Egge</hi> and other <hi>Animals;</hi> for it is in being, before any <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>foetus</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, or any rudiment of him extant. Nay ſo ſoon as he is diſcernable, and is yet but <hi>gelly,</hi> and very ſmall, ſo great a quantity of <hi>Water</hi> is to be ſeen, that it is utterly impoſſible, ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable a <hi>bulk</hi> ſhould afford ſuch plenty of <hi>Excrement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Adde to this, that the <hi>fibres</hi> of the <hi>Umbilical veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels</hi> are ſcattered and terminated in the <hi>membrane</hi> conteining this <hi>Water,</hi> as in the <hi>Yolk</hi> and <hi>White</hi> of the <hi>Egge:</hi> to give evidence clearly (if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the thing, as it truely is) that this <hi>humour,</hi> is rather to be conceived the <hi>Aliment,</hi> then the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his <hi>opinion</hi> ſeems to me more probable then that of <hi>Fabricius,</hi> and other <hi>Anatomiſts,</hi> who count this <hi>Liquor</hi> the <hi>Sweat,</hi> and Prejudice of the <hi>foetus.</hi> For I believe that this <hi>Colliquamentum,</hi> or <hi>Water</hi> wherein the <hi>foetus</hi> ſwims, doth ſerve for his ſuſtenance; and that the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner &amp; purer part of it, being imbibed by the <hi>Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilical Veſſels,</hi> do conſtitute and ſupply the <hi>primoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit parts:</hi> and the reſt, like <hi>Milk,</hi> being by <hi>ſucti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> conveyed into the <hi>Stomack</hi> and there concocted or chylified, and afterwards attracted by the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifices</hi> of the <hi>Meſeraick Veins,</hi> doth nouriſh and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the tender <hi>Embryo.</hi> And to fortifie my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, I ſhall lay down ſome arguments, that prevaile with me.</p>

So ſoon as the <hi>foetus</hi> attains any perfection, he preſently ſtirres his <hi>Limbs,</hi> and proceeds to make tryal of thoſe actions, to which his <hi>Inſtruments of motion</hi> are deſigned. Now we ſee the <hi>Chicken</hi> in the <hi>Egge,</hi> open his <hi>mouth</hi> amidſt this <hi>Water;</hi> whereby he muſt needs ſwallow it down. For it is moſt certain, that whatſoever is gone beyond the <hi>roote</hi> of the <hi>Tongue,</hi> and is arrived at the <hi>top</hi> of the <hi>Gul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,</hi> no creature can return (but by <hi>Vomition)</hi> whereupon the <hi>Farriers,</hi> which adminiſter medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal <hi>Potions, Boles,</hi> or <hi>Pills,</hi> to <hi>Cattel,</hi> taking them by the <hi>tongue</hi> caſt it in beyond the protuberance of the <hi>Tongue,</hi> juſt at the <hi>Root,</hi> that ſo they cannot avoid the ſwallowing. And if any of us, convey a <hi>Pill</hi> ſo far as the <hi>root</hi> of the <hi>tongue,</hi> he ſhall find himſelf neceſſitated to ſwallow it down, unleſs a <hi>Vomit</hi> meet, and repel it. Wherefore ſince the <hi>Embryo</hi> wallowing in the fore-ſaid <hi>liquor,</hi> doth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his <hi>mouth;</hi> it follows likewiſe that it muſt enter in; and ſince he moves his other <hi>muſcles,</hi> why ſhould we doubt, but that he imployes the <hi>Inſtrument</hi> of his <hi>throat</hi> likewiſe, and ſo imbibes the <hi>humour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover it is certain, that in the <hi>Craw</hi> of the <hi>Chicken</hi> (and the like is alſo found in the <hi>Stomack</hi> of all <hi>Embryo</hi>'s) there is ſeen a <hi>ſubſtance</hi> moſt like in <hi>colour, taſt,</hi> and <hi>conſiſtence</hi> to the ſaid <hi>liquor;</hi> which being a while digeſted in the <hi>Stomack,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles <hi>coagulated Milk;</hi> and we have alſo found it like to <hi>Chyle,</hi> in the <hi>upper Gut,</hi> the <hi>lower Guts</hi> being then ſtuft with <hi>Excrements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So alſo in the <hi>foetus</hi> of <hi>Viviparous creatures,</hi> the thicker <hi>Guts</hi> are full of ſuch an <hi>Excrement</hi> as that, wherewith they do abound all the while they are ſed with <hi>Milk.</hi> Alſo in Sheep and other beaſts which divide the <hi>Hoof,</hi> the dried dung is manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ſeen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="360" facs="tcp:56144:202"/>
About the <hi>ſeventeenth day,</hi> I have evidently found <hi>excrement</hi> in a <hi>Chicken,</hi> neer the <hi>fundament;</hi> and have alſo ſeen it, when it hath been diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the <hi>Secundines,</hi> a litle before the <hi>excluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And <hi>Volcherus Coiter,</hi> a diligent and skilful <hi>Anatomiſt,</hi> records the ſame obſervation. Why then ſhould we ſcruple to ſay, that the <hi>foetus</hi> in the <hi>Womb</hi> doth <hi>ſuck;</hi> and that a <hi>Chyle</hi> is made there; when we have both the apparent <hi>principle,</hi> and <hi>rejectments</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Beſides, at that time when we ſee both the <hi>blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> one full of <hi>Gall,</hi> and the other of <hi>Urine</hi> (both which are <hi>excrements</hi> of the <hi>ſecond concoction)</hi> why may we not conclude that <hi>Chylifaction,</hi> which is the firſt <hi>concoction,</hi> went before it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Embryo</hi> therfore <hi>ſucks,</hi> and receives <hi>nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in at the <hi>Mouth.</hi> And this you ſhall ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry, if ſo ſoon as ever he is borne, you put your <hi>finger</hi> into his <hi>mouth.</hi> Which according to <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> would not be, had he not <hi>ſucked</hi> before in the <hi>Womb.</hi> For we ſee young Children make <hi>eſſays,</hi> and attempt upon all performances: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, moving their <hi>Limbs, crawling</hi> along, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to <hi>ſpeak:</hi> all which they attain at laſt with dexterity, by long practice, and education. But ſo ſoon as ever they are born, nay before they are born, they will <hi>ſuck.</hi> For we have found by experience, that while they yet ſtick faſt in the <hi>Birth,</hi> before they can either <hi>cry</hi> or <hi>breath,</hi> they will ſeize upon the <hi>finger</hi> extended to them, and ſuck it.</p>
            <p>Nay, A <hi>New-born Child</hi> is more exact at <hi>ſucking,</hi> then a grown <hi>body,</hi> or himſelf either if he diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it but a few days. For the <hi>Infant</hi> doth not compreſs the <hi>Nipple,</hi> and ſuck at the rate that we do by <hi>gulping</hi> down: but as if he would devour
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:56144:202"/>
the Nipple, he ſtill draws it into his <hi>mouth,</hi> and by the aid of his <hi>tongue,</hi> and <hi>palate,</hi> he ſucks the milk, as if he chewed it; with farre more earneſtneſs, and ſlight, then a <hi>grown body.</hi> Wherefore he ſeems to be good at it of old, and to have practiſed it in the <hi>womb;</hi> for we ſee how ſoon he unlearns it by diſcontinuance.</p>
            <p>By theſe and other <hi>Obſervations</hi> it is probable, that the Chicken is fed two waies in the <hi>Egge,</hi> namely, both by the <hi>Umbilical,</hi> and the <hi>Meſeraick Veiues:</hi> by the former, he attracts well digeſted <hi>aliment,</hi> whereby the <hi>Blood,</hi> and <hi>primogenit parts</hi> are conſtituted, and encreaſed; by the other, Chyle, which conduces to the <hi>fabrick,</hi> and <hi>augmentation</hi> of the other <hi>parts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, perhaps the reaſon may ſeem obſcure, wherefore the ſame <hi>Agent</hi> ſhould out of the ſame <hi>Matter</hi> proceed to a diverſe manner of <hi>Nutrition:</hi> (when <hi>Nature</hi> doth nothing in vain) yet we will endeavour to diſcover the reaſon.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Part</hi> which is attracted by the <hi>Umbilical Veines,</hi> is the purer and ſincerer part: But the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining <hi>Colliquamentum</hi> wherein the <hi>Foetus</hi> floats, is a kind of crude <hi>milk,</hi> without cream, deprived of its purer part. The more <hi>pure</hi> part therefore ſtands in no need of farther <hi>concoction,</hi> as the other doth, which therefore is received into the <hi>Stomack,</hi> and there <hi>chylified.</hi> The thin, and crude <hi>milk,</hi> ſuch as is found in the <hi>breaſt</hi> preſently after delivery, is like this. For the diſſolved <hi>White</hi> of an <hi>Egg,</hi> and the <hi>crude</hi> and <hi>watry milk</hi> in the <hi>breaſt</hi> or <hi>udder,</hi> are of the ſelf ſame <hi>colour, taſte,</hi> and <hi>conſiſtence.</hi> Alſo the firſt <hi>milk</hi> given, is ſerous, and <hi>watry;</hi> and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in <hi>Childe-bed</hi> do milk a kinde of water out of their <hi>breaſts,</hi> before the <hi>milk</hi> is concocted, and perfectly <hi>white.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="362" facs="tcp:56144:203"/>
And therefore the <hi>Colliquamentum</hi> found in the <hi>Chickens crop</hi> is a kinde of crude <hi>Milk;</hi> and the very ſame afterwards found in the <hi>Giſard,</hi> is <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted, white,</hi> and <hi>coagulated.</hi> So likewiſe in <hi>Vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parous Animals,</hi> before their <hi>milk</hi> is digeſted in their <hi>breaſt,</hi> it looks like a kinde of <hi>Dew,</hi> or <hi>Colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quamentum;</hi> and ſo on the contrary, the <hi>Colliqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum,</hi> after it is concocted in the <hi>Stomack,</hi> puts on the likeneſs of <hi>Milk.</hi> Whence it comes to paſs, according to <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> opinion, that the firſt and moſt <hi>principal parts</hi> are faſhioned out of the finer and purer <hi>materials:</hi> but of the courſer, (by a new <hi>concoction</hi> in the <hi>Stomack)</hi> refined, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and inferiour ſort of <hi>parts</hi> are made: ſo that <hi>Nature</hi> like a kinde, indulgent <hi>mother,</hi> would rather abound with <hi>Supernumeraries,</hi> then be ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Neceſſaries.</hi> Or rather, we muſt affirm it conſonant to reaſon, that the <hi>foetus</hi> now grown more perfect in himſelf, ſhould alſo be ſuſtained after a more perfect manner <hi>(viz.</hi> by the <hi>Mouth)</hi> and attract his <hi>aliment</hi> more refined, and rendered more devoid of <hi>dreggs,</hi> by the two precedent <hi>Concoctions;</hi> (As being thereby cleanſed from two ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Excrements.)</hi> At firſt, indeed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuſtained by the <hi>Umbilical Veſſels,</hi> he lives like a <hi>Plant</hi> ſupplyed by its <hi>root;</hi> and hereupon his <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> looks <hi>indigeſted, white,</hi> and <hi>imperfect;</hi> and like a <hi>Plant,</hi> he remaines fixt, and immoveable. But ſo ſoon as he enjoyes the ſame <hi>aliment</hi> more elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, as now inſpired with a diviner <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing in a higher pitch of <hi>Vegetation,</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Gelly</hi> is transformed into <hi>fleſh,</hi> the <hi>Organs</hi> of <hi>motion</hi> are <hi>diſtinct,</hi> the <hi>ſpirits</hi> are enricht, and he <hi>himſelf</hi> begins to move: and now no longer is cheriſhed like a <hi>Plant</hi> by his <hi>roots,</hi> but lives the <hi>life</hi> of an <hi>Animal,</hi> and is nouriſhed at the <hi>Mouth.</hi>

            <p>HAving declared thoſe mutations, and ſeveral proceedings, which are required in a <hi>Hen-egg,</hi> in order to the production of the <hi>Chicken; Fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> proceeds to diſcourſe of the uſes of the <hi>whole Egge,</hi> and of its <hi>Parts:</hi> and this not onely in a <hi>Hen-egge,</hi> but in all other kindes of <hi>Eggs.</hi> Where he alſo demands, Why ſome <hi>Eggs</hi> are <hi>heterogeneous,</hi> and compounded of <hi>diverſe parts;</hi> and others are <hi>homogeneous,</hi> and <hi>ſimilar?</hi> ſuch as the <hi>Eggs</hi> of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects</hi> are, and of thoſe creatures, which are conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted out of the <hi>whole Egge,</hi> (by a <hi>Metamorphoſis)</hi> and not generated out of one <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>egge,</hi> and nouriſhed by the other, as the <hi>Chicken</hi> is.</p>
            <p>But my buſineſs is not to treat of all <hi>Eggs</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral (as not having in this Tract delivered their <hi>hiſtory)</hi> but onely of <hi>Hen-eggs,</hi> and the benefits or advantages ariſing from their <hi>parts:</hi> all which ought to tend to that, to which the Action of the whole is directed; which <hi>Fabricius</hi> truly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, <note place="margin">pag. 50.</note> to be nothing elſe but the <hi>Generation</hi> and <hi>Augmentation</hi> of the <hi>Chicken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And amongſt thoſe things which relate to the <hi>Whole Egge, Fabricius</hi> doth recount the <hi>Figure, Quantity, and Number of the Egges. The Figure of the Egge,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is round, that the whole bulk of the Chicken might be contained in the leſſer ſpace; for</hi>

               <hi>expoſed to outward injuries; it is therefore eſteemed the ſafeſt figure, and moſt convenient for the Excluſion of the Chicken.</hi> Now <hi>Fabricius</hi> upon this ground, ought to have aſſigned the reaſon, why <hi>Hen-egges</hi> are not <hi>ſpherical</hi> (as the fry, or <hi>eggs</hi> of <hi>fiſhes, worms,</hi> and <hi>froggs</hi> are) but <hi>acuminated</hi> and <hi>oblong.</hi> What impediment is there which hinders them from this perfect figure?

               <hi>cauſe,</hi> out of which the Chicken is made by the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice of the <hi>ſeed.</hi> For it is neither made of both the <hi>Chalazae,</hi> nor yet of any one of them, as hath been diſcovered in our <hi>Hiſtory.</hi> Nor is the Generation of the Chicken accompliſhed by a <hi>Metamorphoſis,</hi> or delineation and diviſion of the <hi>Chalazae,</hi> but by in <hi>Epigeneſis,</hi> as we have explained. Nor is the <hi>Chalaza</hi> principally fructified by the <hi>ſeed,</hi> but the <hi>Cicatricula</hi> rather, or the <hi>Eggs-eye,</hi> as we call it: out of which being enlarged, the <hi>colliquamentum</hi> doth reſult: and afterward in the <hi>colliquamentum,</hi> and out of it, the <hi>Blood, Veines, Veſiculae pulſantes,</hi> and the whole Body is at laſt conſtituted.

            <p>To the Eggs ſecond Action (which is the <hi>Nutriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and <hi>Augmentation</hi> of the Chicken) <hi>Fabricius</hi> calls in the <hi>White</hi> and <hi>Yolk. The Quantity of the yolk and white,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is proportioned to the better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the former action, as alſo to the abſolution and juſt encreaſe of the chicken. The Egg-ſhell, and Membranes, are conſtituted for the ſafeguard of the whole, and alſo of the action of the Egg. But the veins, and arteries, which do convey the aliment, are ſuch as without them the encreaſe and nutrition could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet he leaves us in ſuſpenſe, not knowing whether he mean the <hi>Umbilical Veſſels</hi> of the <hi>foetus</hi> it ſelf, or the <hi>veines</hi> and <hi>arteries</hi> of the mother, as thoſe inſtruments by which the <hi>egg</hi> is augmented.

            <p>And as for theſe two diſtinct <hi>Liquors</hi> all men li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving do admit them; But I, as I lately told you, have diſcovered even two diſtinct <hi>Whites</hi> in an <hi>egg,</hi> divided by two diſtinct Membranes, the ſuperior <hi>White</hi> comprehending another within it; juſt as the <hi>Yolk</hi> is comprehended by the <hi>White.</hi> And theſe two <hi>Whites</hi> are of a different nature: being reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in a diſtinct place, and conteined or conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in a diſtinct <hi>Membrane,</hi> and therefore deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a diſtinct uſe and intent.

            </p>
            <p>But of this more hereafter, when we come to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the manner, how the <hi>foetus</hi> of <hi>Viviparous Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals</hi> is formed, &amp; augmented in the <hi>Womb,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to demonſtrate, that every <hi>foetus</hi> what ever doth derive its original from an <hi>Egge;</hi> and is ſuſteined by a twofold <hi>Albugineous Aliment</hi> in the <hi>Uterus.</hi> For one of theſe is thinner, and conteined within the <hi>Egge</hi> (or <hi>Conception)</hi> it ſelf: the other is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted and drawn by the <hi>Umbilical Veſſels</hi> from the <hi>Cotyledones,</hi> or Orifices of the <hi>Veſſels</hi> diſſemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

into the <hi>After-birth,</hi> and the <hi>Womb.</hi> That ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is conteined in the <hi>Conception</hi> it ſelf, doth reſemble the thinner <hi>White,</hi> both in <hi>colour,</hi> and <hi>conſiſtence,</hi> for it is <hi>glewy, liquid,</hi> and <hi>pellucid,</hi> and very like that ſubſtance, which we call the <hi>Colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quamentum</hi> in the <hi>Egg,</hi> and in this the <hi>foetus</hi> ſwims, &amp; is fed by it at the <hi>mouth.</hi> But that which the <hi>foetus</hi> attracts by the aid of his <hi>Umbilical Veſſels</hi> from the <hi>Placenta</hi> or <hi>After-burden,</hi> is more thick and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous, and very like to the thicker <hi>White</hi> of the <hi>egge.</hi> By which it plainly appears, that the <hi>foetus</hi> is no more ſuſteined in the <hi>Womb</hi> by his <hi>mothers blood,</hi> then the ſucking <hi>Child</hi> is afterwards nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by it, or the <hi>Chicken</hi> in the <hi>egge:</hi> but is fed by an <hi>Albugineous Matter,</hi> which is concocted in the <hi>Placenta</hi> or <hi>Cake</hi> of the <hi>Womb;</hi> and doth reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the <hi>White</hi> of an <hi>Egge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is the contemplation of that divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence leſſe profitable, then wonderful; by which nature both in the <hi>Generation</hi> and <hi>Growth</hi> of the <hi>foetus</hi> (as taking into her conſideration their age, and abilities) provides a convenient aliment for each of them, accommodating meats of more eaſie to ſome, and of more difficult digeſtion to others. For as the <hi>foetus</hi> attains a greater ſtrength and ability to digeſt; ſo is a groſſer and tougher aliment provided for him. And this may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved even in the diverſe kind of <hi>Milk</hi> in <hi>Animals:</hi> for when the <hi>Infant</hi> is new born, the <hi>Mothers Milk</hi> is thinner, and of more facile <hi>digeſtion;</hi> but in proceſs of time, and the ſtrength of the <hi>foetus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now improved, it growes thicker and more coagulated.

part of a ranker conſtitution, then they: and ſo have older <hi>Milk,</hi> and more coagulated, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of harder digeſtion; it often falls out, that the <hi>Infants</hi> which are born of ſuch Mothers cannot away with the <hi>Milk</hi> of ſuch <hi>Nurſes</hi> (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally about the time of breeding their <hi>Teeth)</hi> but by reaſon of crudities, or corrupted <hi>Milk,</hi> are tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with <hi>Feavers, Looſneſs, Vomitings, Paines</hi> in the <hi>Guts, Coughs,</hi> and <hi>Epilepſies,</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p>That which <hi>Fabricius</hi> affirms, and indeavours to ſtrengthen with certain arguments: namely, that the <hi>Chalazae</hi> are the ſubject matter of the <note place="margin">pag. 34.</note> 
               <hi>Chicken,</hi> we have formerly diſproved in our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, and have withal made it appear, that the ſubſtance and firſt lineaments of the <hi>chicken</hi> are laied, while the <hi>Chalazae</hi> are intire, and unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: as likewiſe in a diſtinct place of the <hi>Egge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is it true <hi>that the chalazae</hi> (which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivs <hi>the cocks ſeed doth fructifie) do ſupply the office</hi>

               <hi>of ſeed, that ſo the chicken might be made out of them.</hi> Neither do the <hi>chalazae ſo repreſent the ſeed, in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, ſubſtance, or propriety of body</hi> (as he would <note place="margin">pag. 57.</note> have it) <hi>or ſo reſemble the picture of a chicken in an egge that is boiled, that we ought of right to conceive all the ſpermatical parts to be thence extracted.</hi> But we are rather to conceive that the <hi>colliquamentum</hi> mentioned by us, or the thinner part of the <hi>white</hi> reſolved, and concocted, doth put on the nature of <hi>ſeed,</hi> and ſupply its place, as our eyes may evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>And therefore that contemplation of this reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend ſage is too ſupi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>whole ſubſtance of the Animal is conſtituted of two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and contrary bodies; namely, hot, and cold, (all the red and ſanguineous parts being hot, as the Liver, Heart, Spleen, Reins, Lungs, and in ſhort all</hi>
               <pb n="373" facs="tcp:56144:208"/>
               <hi>the fleſhy, and muſculous parts: and on the contrary, all the White and Bloodleſs, as the Ligaments, Nerves, Bones, Griſtles; and all the Membranous parts, as the Stomack, Guts, Womb, the Pericardium, or Purſe of the Heart and the like, are cold) theſe two diverſe kind of parts, do, without queſtion, require a diverſe, and yet a like Aliment to ſuſtein them; if that poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be true, namely,</hi> ex iiſdem nutrimur, ex qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus conſtamus, <hi>we are nouriſhed by the ſame ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, out of the which we are made. Therefore of right, do the Spermatical cold, and white parts, require a white and cold Aliment; but the Sanguineous, the red, and hot parts, require a red and hot ſuſtenance. And therefore of good right is the White of the Egg, which is cold and bloodleſs, deputed to nouriſh the cold; white, and bloodleſs parts; but the Yolk, as being a hot, red, and ſanguineous Liquor, ſubſtituted to the hot, and ſanguineous. For by this means all the parts of the Animal, may cater and procure for themſelves a convenient and familiar nutriment.</hi> For we do by no means conſent, that the diverſe parts of the <hi>egge,</hi> are ordeined to nouriſh the diverſe parts of the <hi>chicken,</hi> having formerly ſhewed, that the <hi>Heart, Lungs, Reins, Liver, Muſcles, Ligaments,</hi> and all the <hi>parts</hi> of the whole <hi>body,</hi> do appear <hi>white</hi> and <hi>bloodleſs</hi> at the firſt.</p>
            <p>And upon this argument of <hi>Fabricius,</hi> it would inſue, that the <hi>Heart, Lungs, Liver, Spleen,</hi> &amp;c. are not <hi>Spermatical parts,</hi> or conſtituted out of the <hi>Seed:</hi> (which he will upon no terms conſent to) becauſe they alſo are afterwards fed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by <hi>Blood;</hi> for all things are made, and nouriſhed by one and the ſame thing; becauſe nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition is onely a ſubſtitution of a like ſubſtance into the room of that which is loſt.</p>
            <p>Nor will it leſs diſtract him to make anſwer,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:56144:209"/>
how (when the white is now clean exhauſted) the cold, and white parts (namely, the <hi>Ligaments, Bones, Brain, Spinal-Marrow,</hi> &amp;c.) are likewiſe nouriſhed, and inlarged by the <hi>Yolk,</hi> the <hi>Yolk</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no leſs a diſproportionated aliment to theſe, then the <hi>White</hi> is to the hot, red, and ſanguineous parts.</p>
            <p>Nay, according to the fore-cited opinion, the hot, and ſanguineous parts are to be the poſt-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit parts, or born laſt: that is, the Fleſh after the Bones; the Liver, and the Lungs after the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Guts: and the cold parts of the <hi>body</hi> are to be upon the Forge all the <hi>while</hi> the <hi>White</hi> is conſuming; and after them the <hi>hot,</hi> when the <hi>Yolk</hi> begins to decline and waſh it ſelf away to ſupply their growth: ſo that all the parts could not poſſiby ariſe out of the ſame <hi>Whites.</hi> But all theſe matters are confuted by ocular experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>To confirm this: the <hi>Egges,</hi> or <hi>Spawn</hi> of <hi>Carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagineous Fiſhes</hi> (namely, the Ray, the Fork-fiſh, and the Dog-fiſh) are partly coloured, and have a well complexioned <hi>Yolk;</hi> and yet all the parts of thoſe very fiſhes (even the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> it ſelf) appears <hi>white, cold,</hi> and <hi>bloodleſs.</hi> And on the contrary, I have ſeen a race of <hi>Hens</hi> and <hi>Cocks,</hi> which are of a large ſtature, their <hi>feathers</hi> blackiſh, their <hi>fleſh</hi> full of <hi>blood,</hi> and their <hi>Liver</hi> more ruddy then ordinary; and yet their egges, even the fertile ones, have exceeding pale <hi>Yolks,</hi> of no deeper a yellow then the ſtraw of ripe <hi>Barly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fabricius</hi> in the ſubſequent words, ſeems to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract his former ſpeeches: ſaying, <hi>But one thing is</hi> 
               <note place="margin">pag. 55.</note> 
               <hi>very wonderful both in the Yolk and White; that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them being blood, yet they are ſo neer of kin to blood, that they are but little different from it, and</hi>
               <pb n="375" facs="tcp:56144:209"/>
               <hi>a ſmall matter keeps them from being, very blood it ſelfe: and therefore a little paines, and a ſlender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction ſufficeth to convert them into blood. And this is the reaſon why we alwaies diſcover thoſe Veins and Arteries which are propagated into the membranes of the Yolk and White to be full of blood; and yet the Yolk and White abide ſtill in their own nature: but ſo ſoon as either of the two is attracted into the Veſſels, it preſently tranſforms into blood; ſo neer allyed are they to blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if it is moſt certain, that <hi>blood</hi> is no leſs conteined in thoſe propagations of the <hi>Veins</hi> which are diſſeminated into the <hi>White,</hi> then in thoſe that are derived into the <hi>Yolk:</hi> and each of theſe Liquors is ſo neerly related to <hi>blood,</hi> that a very ſmal matter will procure their tranſmigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into it; who will deny, that the <hi>blood,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently all the <hi>Sanguineous</hi> parts are as well nouriſhed and inlarged by the <hi>White,</hi> as by the <hi>Yolk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon <hi>Fabricius</hi> provides for his retreat: ſaying, <hi>Though all this be true, yet we are to conceive,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>that this ſubſtance, which is attracted from the Yolk and White by the Veins, is blood in that maner only, as Chyle is in the Meſeraick Veins; in which there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diſcoverable but meer blood; whereas the Chyle hath onely received the ſhadow of blood, and is to be compleated in the Liver; ſo that ſubſtance attracted by the Veins out of the Yolk and White, preſently puts in the ſhadow and reſemblance of blood,</hi> &amp;c. Well, be it ſo: yet though he lurk in this ſhadow, he doth not ſalve the doubt, which is, why the <hi>Blood,</hi> and ſanguineous parts may not, for the fore-cited rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, be as well nouriſhed by the <hi>White</hi> as the <hi>Yolk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If he had ſaid, that the hotter <hi>parts,</hi> are rather
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:56144:210"/>
nouriſhed by that <hi>blood</hi> (or Aliment conteined in the <hi>blood,</hi> which is proportionable to the <hi>Chyle)</hi> which is attracted out of the <hi>Yolk,</hi> then out of the <hi>White:</hi> and ſo on the contrary, that the cold parts are ſupplied rather by that Nutriment which the Veins tranſport from the <hi>White,</hi> then from the <hi>Yolk,</hi> I ſhould not have much oppoſed him.</p>
            <p>The main thing that diſturbs him in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is this, how the <hi>Blood</hi> can be made in the <hi>Egge;</hi> or what Artificer can transform the two Liquors into <hi>blood,</hi> when there is yet no <hi>Liver</hi> in Being? For he could not ſay that the <hi>blood</hi> in the <hi>Egge</hi> is derived from the <hi>Mothers blood.</hi> But ſaith, <hi>This blood is rather wrought in the Veins then in the Liver: but it becomes a bone, a griſtle, or fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in the parts themſelves, where it is exactly concocted, and aſſimulated,</hi> without any farther addition at all; not ſignifying by whom the <hi>blood</hi> which is in the Veins diſperſed both into the <hi>Yolk</hi> and <hi>White,</hi> is concocted, elaborated, and made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, when as yet no <hi>Liver</hi> at all is extant, or any particle of the <hi>body,</hi> that might concoct or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat it. And when he had formerly ſaid, that the cold parts are nouriſhed by the <hi>White,</hi> the hot by the <hi>Yolk;</hi> not mindful of his aſſertion, he here concludes the quite contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> that the ſame <hi>blood</hi> doth tranſmigrate into <hi>bones, griſtles, fleſh,</hi> and other parts.</p>
            <p>But he lets that grand difficulty, which ſo much diſouiets the Phyſitians minds, glide by in ſilence, without taking any knowledge of it: namely, how the <hi>Liver</hi> can be the <hi>Original</hi> and <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>blood:</hi> ſeeing that <hi>blood</hi> is not onely found in the <hi>egge,</hi> before any one of the <hi>bowels</hi> are fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at all: but Phyſitians themſelves do teach,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:56144:210"/>
that all the ſubſtance or <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the <hi>bowels</hi> themſelves, are meerly ſo many <hi>affuſions;</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxes of <hi>blood.</hi> Is the <hi>Effect,</hi> the <hi>Author</hi> of its own <hi>Efficient?</hi> If the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the <hi>Liver</hi> is made of <hi>blood,</hi> how can the <hi>Liver</hi> be the cauſe of <hi>blood?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the inſuing paſſages are of the ſame batch, where he ſaith: <hi>There is alſo another uſe of the White, when it is now ſegregated from the Yolk: namely, that the foetus may ſwimme in it, and ſo be ſuſteined, leſt tending downwards by his own weight, hee might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to one part rather then another, and ſo drawing the Veſſels along with him, might break them in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: and to this uſe the purity and tenacity of the White do conduce. For if the</hi> foetus <hi>ſhould take up his reſidence in the Yolk, he would eaſily deſcend down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bottome, and ſo diſorder and break the Yolk alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A very weak conſtruction this! For what doth the purity of the <hi>White</hi> availe to the ſuſtentation of the Chicken? Or how can the <hi>White</hi> which is more thin, better ſupport the Chicken, then the <hi>Yolk</hi> which is thicker and more groſs then it? Or what danger is there, that the Chicken ſhould fall down? Since the <hi>egge</hi> in Incubation lies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſide-long, ſo that there is no fear of aſcent, or falling down. True it is, indeed, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Chicken, but every <hi>foetus</hi> whatſoever (while it is forming) doth ſwim: but that innatation is in the <hi>Colliquamentum</hi> ſpoken of by us, and not in the <hi>Yolk</hi> or <hi>White:</hi> and we have rendered the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thereof elſewhere.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Writes, that when the</hi> Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>is conceived, the</hi> Yolk <hi>aſcends to the Obtuſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle of the</hi> Egge, <hi>and the reaſon is, becauſe the</hi> Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>is formed out of the</hi> Chalaza, <hi>which adhereth to the</hi> Yolk; <hi>whereupon it behooves the</hi> Yolk, <hi>which is</hi>

               <hi>placed in the middle to mount up to the larger part of the</hi> Egge; <hi>that ſo the</hi> Chicken <hi>may be there made, where there is a natural cavity, very neceſſary to the welfare of the</hi> Chicken.

            </p>
            <p>But the reaſon of that aſcent of the Yolk is this; the <hi>Macula</hi> or litle <hi>cicatrice</hi> which appears in the <hi>coat</hi> of the Yolk, is by reaſon of the ſpirituous <hi>colliquamentum</hi> which is bred in it, dilated; and thereupon requiring more roome, doth tend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Obtuſe Angle of the <hi>Egge:</hi> and ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that portion of the Yolk and White which is melted, is diſtended, and being now grown more concocted and ſpirituous, doth ſwimme upon the other parts that remaine crude: as thoſe parts of water which are warmed in any veſſels, ariſe from the bottome up to the top: an experiment approved by all Phyſitians, who holding the <hi>Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> conteining a thick and troubled <hi>Urine</hi> in warm water, do perceive the upper part thereof, to clear and grow tranſparent firſt. This follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Inſtance will explain the matter. There is a device known to moſt men, which is intended ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for a jocular bable to gaze upon and laugh at, then for any uſeful implement; namely, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Glaſs-globe, which is almoſt filled up with clear water, wherein ſeveral Glaſs-balls which are fraught with nothing but Air, do ſwim upon the ſurface of that water, which by reaſon of their levity do ſupport ſeveral figures (of quivered <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pids,</hi> armed <hi>Centaures,</hi> Chariots of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and the like) which elſe would all ſink down to the bottom. So in like manner, this <hi>Oculus pulli,</hi> this <hi>Eye</hi> of the <hi>Chicken</hi> as I terme it, or firſt Colliqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being dilated by the heat of the <hi>Sitting-Hen,</hi> and the Genital vertue in the Egge, and ſo made

lighter, aſcends to the top, and draws up the <hi>Yolk</hi> to which it adheres together with it.

            <p>THe <hi>Shell</hi> is hard and thick, that ſo it may fence the Liquors, and the Chicken which dwells in them, from outward injuries.

This <hi>Shell</hi> is alſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, for while an <hi>egge</hi> (eſpecially a new-laid one) is in roaſting before the fire, it doth breath out a kind of ſweat, trickling down, as it were, drop by drop. Now theſe pores are uſeful for <hi>Ventilation,</hi> as alſo for the more eaſie <hi>penetration</hi> of the heat which reſults from the <hi>Sitting Hen;</hi> and likewiſe that the Chicken may attract aire from without: for as we have ſaid before, the <hi>chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi> doth, without all queſtion, both breath, and cry before his excluſion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Membranes</hi> ſerve to contein the <hi>Liquors,</hi> and therefore they are as many in number, as the liquors are. And the <hi>Colliquamentum</hi> alſo, ſo ſoon

Of the two <hi>Common coats,</hi> the exteriour which doth ſtick to the <hi>Shell,</hi> is the tighter, that ſo it may not ſuffer violence by the neighbourhood of the <hi>Shell,</hi> but the interiour is ſmooth and ſoft, that ſo it may not prejudice the <hi>Liquors,</hi> as the <hi>Meninges</hi> or <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes</hi> called <hi>dura</hi> and <hi>pia mater,</hi> do defend the <hi>Braine,</hi> from the roughneſs of the <hi>Scull.</hi> The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour, and proper <hi>membranes</hi> do, (as I have ſaid) embrace, and diſtinguiſh the <hi>Liquors:</hi> whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they are very thinne, tranſparent and fraile.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fabricius</hi> doth indeed highly extoll the <hi>Chala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zae,</hi> (as thoſe parts out of which he conceived the Chicken was framed) but as for the <hi>Macula,</hi> or <hi>litle Cicatrice,</hi> which is bred adhering to the <hi>tuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi> of the <hi>yolk;</hi> he concludes it to be a uſeleſs thing, eſteeming it to be no more then a bare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique or remainder of the ſtalk broken off from the <hi>Vitellary,</hi> or ſuperiour <hi>Uterus</hi> of the <hi>Hen.</hi> For (according to his perſwaſion) the <hi>yolk</hi> did former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:56144:212"/>
attract its ſuſtenance through that <hi>ſtalk,</hi> or the <hi>Veſſels</hi> paſſing through it; but the <hi>yolk</hi> being now no longer nouriſhed by the <hi>Hen,</hi> but disjoined from the <hi>Ovary,</hi> there ſtill continues a ſign or track of the former conjunction, and the benefits recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thereby.</p>
            <p>But I on the contrary apprehend, that there is no other uſe of the <hi>Chalazae,</hi> beyond that which I formerly obſerved; namely, that they ſhould be as the <hi>Poles</hi> of that <hi>Microcoſme,</hi> and the ends or connexions of all the <hi>membranes</hi> wound up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereby the <hi>liquors</hi> are not onely continued each in their proper places, but alſo retain a juſt and convenient poſition in relation to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But as for the fore-ſaid <hi>Macula,</hi> I am certain, that it is of the greateſt concern and conſequence of all; as being the chief Center of the <hi>Egg,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Innate heat</hi> hovers and lurks, and out of which, as out of the firſt ſpark, the <hi>ſoul</hi> her ſelf is lighted; and laſtly, for whoſe ſake, all the <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors,</hi> and their reſpective coverings are conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and made.</p>
            <p>Heretofore, indeed, I was of <hi>Fabricius</hi> his mind, deeming this litle <hi>Cicatrice</hi> to be nothing elſe but the remainder or track of the ſtalk broken of; but afterwards, upon more accurate obſervation, I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, that the ſtalk, whereunto the <hi>yolk</hi> is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, is not inſerted into any litle cranny or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the <hi>yolk</hi> (as it is with the ſtalks of <hi>Apples,</hi> and <hi>Plumms)</hi> and that ſo ſome track or print of the connexion or dependance which the <hi>yolk</hi> once had upon the <hi>Ovary,</hi> ſhould continue in it; but that the ſtalk, before it arrives to the Yolk from the Cluſter, is all the way dilated into a round, (like a litle trumpet) that ſo it may encompaſs
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:56144:213"/>
the <hi>horizon,</hi> or the circle of the Yolk, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides it into two <hi>parts;</hi> (as the <hi>Tunica Amphible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroides,</hi> or tunicle which reſembleth a litle round Caſting-Net, doth the Egg) ſo that the ſuperiour part of the Yolk, or Hemiſphere, which looketh towards the Cluſter, is quite free from any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact or coherence of the ſtalk, &amp; yet the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Macula,</hi> or litle <hi>Cicatrice,</hi> is ſeated upon the ſuperiour part of that litle cup, or portion of the <hi>membrane</hi> of the Yolk; (ſomething inclining to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſide) ſo that this <hi>Macula</hi> can upon no terms be ſaid to be the print of the ſtalk broken off from the Yolk. But of how great importance this <hi>macula</hi> is in the <hi>generation</hi> of the Chicken, hath already been diſcovered in our <hi>Hiſtory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It now remains, that following the ſtepps of <hi>Fabricius,</hi> who was formerly my <hi>Tutor,</hi> and is now my Guide, I ſhould declare the uſes of that <hi>Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> which is in the <hi>obtuſe part</hi> of the <hi>Egge.</hi>

               <hi>Fabricius</hi> recounts ſeveral conveniences ariſing from it, according to its ſeveral magnitude: which I ſhall declare in ſhort, ſaying, It contains aire in it, and is therefore commodious to the <hi>Ventilation</hi> of the Egge, to the <hi>Reſpiration, Tranſpiration,</hi> and <hi>Refrigeration,</hi> and laſtly to the <hi>Vociferation</hi> of the Chicken.

               <hi>But all this kinde of litle worms, when it hath attained the end of its magnitude, is made a kinde of Egge; for their ſhell doth harden, and ſo long they continue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out motion: which is apparent in the worms of Bees, and Waſps, and alſo in the Canker-worm.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed every body may ſee, that the firſt rudiments of <hi>Spiders, Silkworms,</hi> and other <hi>Inſects,</hi> are to be no leſs ranked in the claſſis and ſcale of <hi>Eggs,</hi> then the <hi>ſpawn,</hi> or Egges of <hi>Fiſhes</hi> which have ſofter <hi>ſhells,</hi> or of <hi>Fiſhes</hi> which have no <hi>ſhells</hi> at all, and almoſt of all ſort of <hi>fiſhes</hi> whatſoever: which <hi>Spawn</hi> of theirs is not actually an <hi>animate body,</hi> but yet <hi>Animals</hi> are begotten out of them.

<pb n="386" facs="tcp:56144:215"/>
therefore thoſe creatures which do produce <hi>actu Animal,</hi> a Creature actually alive, are called <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viparous:</hi> doubtleſs, thoſe <hi>Animals</hi> which do bring forth a creature which is alive <hi>in potentiâ,</hi> muſt be called <hi>Oviparous Animals,</hi> or elſe they cannot be comprehended under any <hi>Common notion;</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, ſeeing ſuch Productions are <hi>vegetal Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> proportionable to the <hi>ſeeds</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> ſuch as an <hi>egge</hi> alſo is allowed to be. We muſt therefore conclude, that all <hi>Animals</hi> are either <hi>Viviparous,</hi> or <hi>Oviparous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But becauſe there are ſeveral <hi>ſpecies</hi> of <hi>Oviparous Animals,</hi> therefore the difference of Eggs is alſo ſeveral. For any kinde of <hi>Rudiment</hi> is not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Recipient of every kinde of <hi>animal form.</hi> Though therefore Eggs in a large or general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation do not differ, yet ſince ſome are <hi>perfect,</hi> and ſome <hi>imperfect,</hi> they are juſtly diſtinguiſhed. <hi>Perfect</hi> Eggs we call thoſe, which are perfected in the <hi>Uterus,</hi> and obtain there a requiſite magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, before they are layed: as the <hi>Eggs</hi> of <hi>Fowle.</hi> But thoſe we call <hi>Imperfect,</hi> which are excluded ere they are ripe, and have not yet attained their juſt bulk, but do expect that abroad, after they are layed; as the <hi>Spawn</hi> or Eggs of Fiſhes, that have a ſofter ſhell, and of Fiſhes which have none at all; and likewiſe the Rudiments of <hi>Inſects</hi> (which <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> calls <hi>Worms)</hi> are to be liſted in this rank: as alſo the Rudiments of thoſe Creatures which are ſpontaneous productions.</p>
            <p>Moreover, though ſome kindes of <hi>perfect</hi> Egges are party-coloured, as being compounded of a <hi>yolk</hi> and <hi>white;</hi> yet ſome of them are only of one ſingle colour, as conſtituted of a <hi>white</hi> alone: ſo alſo amongſt <hi>imperfect</hi> Eggs, others are properly ſo called, as out of which a <hi>perfect Animal</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:56144:215"/>
as out of the Egges of Fiſhes: and others improperly, from whence an <hi>imperfect Animal</hi> proceeds; namely, a <hi>Worm,</hi> or <hi>Canker-worm;</hi> which is a kinde of <hi>Medium</hi> between a <hi>perfect,</hi> and an <hi>imperfect Egge:</hi> which in reſpect or compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its own <hi>egge,</hi> or Rudiment from whence it ſprung, is an <hi>Animal</hi> indowed with <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and doth nouriſh it ſelf; but in compariſon of a Flye, or Butterflie, whoſe rudiment is <hi>in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiâ,</hi> it is to be counted no better then a <hi>crawling-egge,</hi> ſuſtaining it ſelfe: like to a <hi>Canker-worm,</hi> which having now attained its perfect magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, is transformed into an <hi>Aurelia,</hi> or perfect Egge; and now ceaſing to move any longer, like a very Egge indeed, is an <hi>Animal in potentiâ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like manner, though there are ſome Eggs, out of whoſe whole and entire ſubſtance (by a <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſis,</hi> or Transformation) a perfect <hi>Animal</hi> is formed, which is not fed by any remaining por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Egge, but inſtantly ſeeks out for its maintenance abroad: and other Eggs, out of part of which a <hi>Foetus</hi> is conſtituted, and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the remainder; though (I ſay) there are ſo many ſeveral ſorts and diverſities of Eggs, yet nothing ſtands in the way, to forbid thoſe to be called <hi>Eggs,</hi> which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſtiles <hi>Worms,</hi> (if we may give judgement upon things, according as they diſcover themſelves to our ſenſe and reaſon) ſince they are all <hi>Vegetal principles,</hi> not actually <hi>Animals,</hi> but <hi>in potentiâ,</hi> &amp; the true <hi>ſeeds</hi> of <hi>Animals,</hi> proportionable to the <hi>ſeeds</hi> of <hi>Plants;</hi> as we have long ſince demonſtrated in a <hi>Hen-egg.</hi> All <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals</hi> therefore, are <hi>Viviparous,</hi> or <hi>Oviparous;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they either produce an <hi>Animal</hi> actually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, or elſe an <hi>Egge,</hi> or <hi>Rudiment,</hi> which is an <hi>Animal,</hi> not <hi>actu,</hi> but <hi>in potentiâ.</hi>

The Generation therefore of all <hi>Oviparous Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals</hi> may be reduced to the example of <hi>Hen-eggs,</hi> or at leaſt be eaſily deduced from thence: becauſe the ſame things which are related in their hiſtory, may be diſcovered in the reſt of <hi>Viviparous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>

            <p>But hereafter, when we treat of the Generation of <hi>Inſects,</hi> and of <hi>Spontaneous productions,</hi> we ſhall diſcover how each of them are either differenced amongſt themſelves, or do elſe agree. For ſince every <hi>generation</hi> is a path-way to the attaining of the <hi>form</hi> of every <hi>Animal:</hi> according as <hi>Animals</hi> are either like, or unlike one another, ſo that their parts do neither ſpecifically, nor generical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agree; ſo likewiſe is it uſuall in their <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> For <hi>Nature,</hi> who is a <hi>Perfect Operatrix,</hi> and conſonant to her ſelf in her Operations, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign <hi>Parts</hi> that are alike, to <hi>Operations</hi> and <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> that are alike and agree; and ſo likewiſe to the attainment of the ſame <hi>form,</hi> and the ſame <hi>end,</hi> ſhe treads the ſame ſteps, and perſiſts alwaies in the ſame method in the <hi>Generation</hi> of <hi>Animals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon, in every <hi>perfect party-coloured egge</hi> of any fowle whatever (which is compounded of a <hi>Yolk</hi> and <hi>White,</hi> and fenced with a <hi>Shell)</hi> as we have ſtill obſerved the ſame <hi>parts,</hi> as are in a <hi>Hen-egg,</hi> ſo have we ever found the ſame <hi>order</hi> and <hi>method</hi> of <hi>generating,</hi> and conſtituting the <hi>foetus</hi> (as in a <hi>Hen-egg.)</hi> And the ſelf ſame things may alſo be obſerved in the Eggs of <hi>Serpents,</hi> and all <hi>Oviparous four-footed Animals,</hi> as the <hi>Tortoiſe, Froggs,</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards;</hi> as from whoſe perfect and party-coloured <hi>egges,</hi> the <hi>foetus</hi> is framed and produced, the ſame way, as in others of the like kinde. But how <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and the ſofter <hi>Shell-fiſh,</hi> as <hi>Lobſters,</hi> and <hi>Shrimps,</hi> and the race of Fiſhes that have <hi>ſcales</hi> and
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:56144:216"/>
no <hi>ſhells,</hi> as the <hi>Cuttle-fiſh</hi> and the <hi>Calamire</hi> do get out of their <hi>Eggs,</hi> or <hi>Spawn;</hi> as alſo how <hi>Worms,</hi> and <hi>Catterpillars</hi> do firſt creep out of the <hi>Eggs</hi> of <hi>Inſects,</hi> out of which, at length retreating into the worm or vermine called <hi>Aurelia,</hi> (as into other new <hi>eggs</hi> again) at laſt a common <hi>Flie,</hi> or <hi>Butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flie</hi> is generated; how theſe Creatures, I ſay, doe differ in their Generation out of <hi>Eggs,</hi> from the brood ariſing out of <hi>Hen-eggs,</hi> ſhall be declared in its due place.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, though all <hi>party-coloured egges</hi> are not generated and fructified the ſame way; but ſome become <hi>prolifical</hi> by the <hi>Coition</hi> of a <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,</hi> and others by other meanes, as the <hi>egges</hi> or <hi>frie</hi> of Fiſhes; and though there be alſo a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the manner of the growth of <hi>Egges,</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as ſome are nouriſhed and encreaſed within their parents bowels, and others abroad: yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hinders, why a <hi>foetus</hi> may not be produced out of any <hi>egge</hi> whatſoever, (in caſe it be a <hi>perfect egge)</hi> as well as out of a <hi>Hen-egge.</hi> Wherefore, the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> wherein we have already unfolded the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of a <hi>Hen-egge,</hi> is ſatisfactory and full e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for the knowledge of the <hi>Generation</hi> of all other <hi>Oviparous</hi> creatures beſide; as likewiſe to the knowledge of all thoſe things which doe thence enſue, by way of Corollary, or Dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

            <head>Of the Generation of Vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parous Animals.</head>
            <head>EXER. LXIII.</head>
            <p>THus farre have we proceeded in the <hi>Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>Oviparous Animals;</hi> it follows, that we now produce our Obſervations, concerning the other <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Viviparous productions: wherein we have found very many things which are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the ſame with thoſe which occurre in the <hi>Egge;</hi> which we have reduced hither to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, and come laſt to be delivered. Which, though they are paradoxical, and run counter to the common received tenets, yet are they, if my judgment fail me not, entirely conſonant to the Truth.</p>
            <p>Amongſt <hi>Viviparous Animals,</hi> Man is the chief, and moſt perfect of all: next him (that we may proceed from ſuch as are more known) are ranked thoſe creatures that are more ſociable &amp; obvious: (whereof ſome are <hi>ſolidipeda,</hi> whole-hoofed; as the <hi>Horſe,</hi> and <hi>Aſs:</hi> ſome are <hi>Biſulca,</hi> cloven foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as the <hi>Oxe,</hi> the <hi>Goat,</hi> the <hi>Sheep,</hi> the <hi>Hogg,</hi> and the <hi>Deer:</hi> others <hi>fiſſipeda, ſive digitatis pedibus,</hi> Creatures whoſe feet are diſtinguiſhed into <hi>Toes;</hi> as the <hi>Dog,</hi> the <hi>Cat,</hi> the <hi>Cony,</hi> the <hi>Mouſe,</hi> and the like; out of the manner of whoſe <hi>generation,</hi> we may conclude concerning the <hi>generation</hi> of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Viviparous Animals.</hi> Wherefore, (as we have done in the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Egge,</hi> ſo) we ſhall ſingle out ſome one kinde of theſe, as an <hi>Exemplar</hi> or Repreſentative of all the reſt; which, as being moſt known to us, will give light to the reſt, and
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:56144:217"/>
become a platform, to which all the other may be reduced, by way of <hi>Analogy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have already given you the reaſon, why I have drawn out documents concerning all other <hi>Egges,</hi> from the <hi>Egges</hi> of <hi>Hens:</hi> namely becauſe thoſe are cheap, and every mans purchaſe; and upon that ſcore we our ſelves had the advantage to make the more diligent diſquiſition, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers alſo have the better opportunity to experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the truth of our doctrine.</p>
            <p>But there is more difficulty in the ſearch into the <hi>Generation</hi> of <hi>Viviparous Animals:</hi> for we are almoſt quite debarred of diſſecting the humane <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus:</hi> and to make any inquiry concerning this matter, in <hi>Horſes, Oxen, Goats,</hi> and other Cattel, cannot be without a great deal of paines and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe. But thoſe who are deſirous to make tryal, whether we deliver truth, or not, may aſſay the buſineſs, in <hi>Doggs, Conies, Cats,</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fabricius ab Aquapendente,</hi> as if every <hi>Viviparous conception</hi> were a kind of <hi>egge,</hi> begins his Tract with that; (as being the general exemplar of <hi>Generation)</hi> giving this amongſt other, as the chief ground of his proceedings; namely, <hi>becauſe the contemplation of the egge, is of the largeſt extent:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>De form. Ovi &amp; Pulli, c.</hi> 1.</note> 
               <hi>for the greateſt part of Animals,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of Egges.</hi> But we in the entrance of theſe our Obſervations, have concluded that all <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals</hi> are in ſome ſort produced out of an <hi>Egg:</hi> For the <hi>foetus</hi> of <hi>Viviparous creatures</hi> is produced after the ſame manner and order out of a pre-exiſtent <hi>conception,</hi> as the Chicken is formed and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted out of an <hi>Egge:</hi> There being one and the ſame <hi>ſpecies</hi> of <hi>generation</hi> in them all, and the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordium</hi> or firſt <hi>principle</hi> of them all is either called an <hi>egge,</hi> or at leſt ſomething anſwerable and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:56144:218"/>
to it. For an <hi>Egge</hi> is an expoſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception from which a Chicken is produced; but a <hi>conception</hi> is an <hi>egge</hi> retained within, untill the <hi>foetus</hi> have attained its juſt bulk, and magnitude: in other matters it ſquares with an <hi>egge:</hi> for they both are <hi>Vegetal rudiments,</hi> and alſo <hi>Animals in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiâ.</hi> Wherefore the ſame <hi>Theorems,</hi> and <hi>Corolla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> (though contrary to the received perſwaſion) which we have already inferred in the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Egge,</hi> are moſt true: Likewiſe of the <hi>genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of all kind of <hi>Animals.</hi> For it is a confeſſed and plain thing, that all <hi>foetuſes,</hi> even humane ones alſo, are procreated out of ſome conception, (or certain ground-work.) And this is alſo as true: that that thing which is called <hi>Primordium,</hi> the firſt <hi>rudiment</hi> in <hi>ſpontaneous productions, ſemen,</hi> the <hi>ſeed</hi> in <hi>Plants,</hi> and <hi>Ovum</hi> the <hi>Egge,</hi> in <hi>Oviparous</hi> (as being that corporeal ſubſtance, out of which moving and operating by an intrinſecal <hi>principle,</hi> that which is produced is either a <hi>Plant</hi> or an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal:)</hi> that ſame thing in the <hi>Generation</hi> of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viparous Animals</hi> is <hi>conceptus primus;</hi> the firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception: and this is approved to be true both by ſenſe and reaſon.</p>
            <p>What we have formerly affirmed of the <hi>egge,</hi> namely, that it is the <hi>ſperme</hi> and <hi>ſeed</hi> of <hi>Animals,</hi> proportionable to the <hi>ſeed</hi> of <hi>Plants:</hi> the ſame do we now pronounce of the <hi>conception,</hi> which is the reall <hi>ſeed</hi> of <hi>Animals,</hi> and therefore alſo called <hi>An Egge.</hi> For that <hi>is true ſeed</hi> according to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>which takes its Original from two Animals joined in coition;</hi> and obtaines the virtue or power from both Sexes; <hi>ſuch is the ſeed of all Plants, and of ſome Animals which know no diſtinction of Sexes: as it were that which is firſt mixed from. Male and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, being a kind of promiſcuous conception, or Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal:</hi>
               <pb n="393" facs="tcp:56144:218"/>
               <hi>for theſe creatures have that in themſelves alone, which is required of both Sexes:</hi> namely, a fit mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to feed the <hi>foetus,</hi> and alſo a <hi>plaſtical,</hi> or <hi>forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> and <hi>operative vertue</hi> able to produce it. So in like manner, the <hi>conception</hi> is the <hi>fruit</hi> of the <hi>Male,</hi> and <hi>Female</hi> joined in <hi>coition,</hi> and alſo the <hi>ſeed</hi> of the future <hi>foetus;</hi> wherefore it differeth not from an <hi>egg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But that, which proceeding from the Generant, is the cauſe which firſt obtains the principle of Generation</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>(viz.</hi> the Efficient) <hi>ought to be called the Geniture,</hi> but not the <hi>ſeed</hi> (as it is miſcalled by the common people, and Philoſophers too at this day) becauſe it hath not in it that thing which is required of two in <hi>coition,</hi> neither is it proportionable to the Seed of Plants. But whatſoever doth poſſeſs the foreſaid condition, and is anſwerable to the Seed of Plants, that alſo doth deſerve to be called an Egge, and a Conception.</p>
            <p>Alſo the definition of an Egge, delivered by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> doth fully ſquare to it: ſaying, <hi>An</hi> Egge <hi>is</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hiſt. an. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 5.</note> 
               <hi>that thing in perfect productions of part whereof an Animal is made, and ſuſteined by the remainder, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is made.</hi> Now the ſame things agree to a Conception, as ſhall afterwards appear by the diſſection of Viviparous Animals, our Eyes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves being witneſſes thereunto.</p>
            <p>Beſides, as a Chicken is hatched out of an Egg, by the foſtering heat of the Sitting Hen, or ſome other aſcititious hoſpitable patronage, ſo alſo the <hi>Foetus</hi> is produced out of the <hi>conception</hi> in the <hi>egge,</hi> by the ſoft and moſt natural warmth of the <hi>parent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word: that which <hi>Oviparous Animals</hi> afford by <hi>Incubation,</hi> or gathering under their Wings and Breaſt; that is exhibited by <hi>Viviparous,</hi> by the
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:56144:219"/>
               <hi>Womb,</hi> and neereſt, or inward embraces. And then, concerning that which relates to procreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the <hi>foetus</hi> is produced out of the <hi>Conception,</hi> in the ſelfe ſame manner, and order, as the <hi>Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi> out of the <hi>Egg;</hi> With this onely difference, that in an <hi>egge,</hi> whatſoever relates to the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and Nutrition of the Chicken, is at once conteined in it: but the conception (after the <hi>foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> is now formed out of it) doth attract more <hi>nouriſhment</hi> out of his Parents Womb; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>nouriſhment</hi> increaſes with the <hi>foetus.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the <hi>Egge</hi> is quite emptied, when the Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken is grown; and the Aliment which was in it conſumed, nor doth the Chicken attract any more ſuſtenance from the <hi>Hen:</hi> but the <hi>Oviparous Foetus</hi> doth ſtill finde out freſh ſupplies, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteineth it ſelf by <hi>Milk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Eggs,</hi> or <hi>Spawn</hi> of <hi>Fiſhes</hi> are ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by food procured from without; the <hi>Egges</hi> of <hi>Inſects</hi> alſo, whether they have <hi>ſhells</hi> or not, have their proviſions from abroad, nor are they leſſe <hi>eggs</hi> for that, either really, or nominally: ſo in like manner the <hi>Conception</hi> deſerves the title of an <hi>Egge,</hi> though it be ſuſteined by a various kind of Aliment from without.</p>
            <p>Why ſome <hi>Animals</hi> are <hi>Oviparous,</hi> and all do not produce their <hi>Foetus</hi> alive, <hi>Fabricius</hi> offers this reaſon: namely, becauſe <hi>egges</hi> (if they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the <hi>Uterus</hi> till the <hi>Pullus</hi> were hatched) would by their weight prejudice the flight of <hi>Birds.</hi> And alſo in <hi>Serpents,</hi> or creeping things the multitude of <hi>egges</hi> would be an impediment to their winding motions. Nor is there compaſs enough in the narrow circuit of the <hi>Snailes ſhell,</hi> to afford room to the number &amp; increaſe of <hi>eggs.</hi> So likewiſe the <hi>Fiſhes</hi> bellies are too ſcanty to
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:56144:219"/>
contein their numerous <hi>Fry,</hi> ſhould they grow within them. And therefore theſe ſeveral crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are inforced to exclude their <hi>births,</hi> ere they arrive to perfection. So that it ſeems moſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral for an <hi>Animal,</hi> to contein and cheriſh its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception within it ſelf, untill the <hi>foetus</hi> be quite perfected: but nature is ſometimes conſtrained to expoſe her iſſues immature, and imperfect, and to compleat them with proviſions ſought for from without.</p>
            <p>For as much therefore as concerns <hi>procreation,</hi> All kind of <hi>Animals</hi> are generated after the ſame manner out of an <hi>Egge-like Rudiment:</hi> (which we call <hi>Egg-like,</hi> not that every <hi>Rudiment</hi> of an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal</hi> doth reſemble an Egge in Figure, but in Nature and Conſiſtence) For in all their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive <hi>Generations</hi> this they have in common, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that a certain <hi>Vegetal principle</hi> is pre-exiſtent (of like nature to an Egge, and anſwering in proportion to the <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Plants)</hi> out of which the <hi>foetus</hi> is produced. And this <hi>Egg</hi> or <hi>Egg-like</hi> ſubſtance is in them all, poſſeſſing the nature and conditions required in an <hi>Egg:</hi> which conditions alſo the ſeeds of <hi>Plants</hi> have common to them, as well as <hi>Animals.</hi> And for that cauſe the <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> of any kind of <hi>Animals,</hi> are called their <hi>Fruits,</hi> and <hi>Seeds,</hi> and ſo likewiſe the <hi>Seeds</hi> of all <hi>Plants</hi> may in a manner be called <hi>Egges,</hi> and <hi>Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to this purpoſe <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaks, ſaying: <note place="margin">

               <hi>Thoſe creatures which bring forth an Animal from within themſelves, have ſomething formed in them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt conception like unto an egge: for they have an humour conteined in a thin coat, ſuch as that in an egge when the ſhell is pilled off.

            <p>BEing about to treat of the Formation and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the <hi>Hinde</hi> and <hi>Doe,</hi> we muſt firſt diſcourſe concerning the place wherein thoſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are performed, namely the <hi>Uterus;</hi> (as we have already done in the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Hen)</hi> that ſo thoſe things which enſue, may be more eaſily and rightly underſtood. For in this very thing. <hi>Hiſtory</hi> hath the precedence of <hi>Romance</hi> and <hi>Fable;</hi> namely, in that ſhe deſcribes events with their juſt circumſtance of ſet times and places, and ſo guides us unto knowledge by a ſurer way.</p>
            <p>But that we may the better conceive the <hi>Deere's Uterus,</hi> we ſhall explain both the <hi>internal,</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal fabrick</hi> thereof, taking our pattern from the <hi>womb</hi> of <hi>Women.</hi> For <hi>Man,</hi> who is the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate or complete <hi>Animal</hi> of all other, as he hath obtained all other <hi>parts</hi> more perfect then
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:56144:221"/>
they, ſo are his <hi>Genital parts</hi> alſo. And therefore the <hi>Uterine parts</hi> are moſt diſtinct in a <hi>Woman,</hi> and to us (by reaſon of the ſpecial induſtry of <hi>Anatomiſts</hi> about this <hi>Part)</hi> better known.</p>
            <p>Now in the <hi>Uterus</hi> of <hi>Hinds,</hi> &amp; <hi>Does,</hi> many things do occurr which you may diſcover to be the ſame in the <hi>womb</hi> of a <hi>Woman;</hi> but yet ſome things do differ. In the <hi>external orifice,</hi> are neither the <hi>labra,</hi> nor the <hi>Clitoris,</hi> nor the <hi>Nymphae;</hi> but onely two <hi>Orifices</hi> (whereof one is the <hi>Orifice</hi> of the <hi>Bladder,</hi> adjoined to the <hi>Share-bone;</hi> the other of the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,</hi> ſeated between the <hi>fundament</hi> and the <hi>Urmary cavity.)</hi> The membranous <hi>Cuticle</hi> (like to that which we have noted in a <hi>Henne)</hi> tending down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from the <hi>fundament,</hi> doth cover the <hi>veil,</hi> and ſupply the office of the <hi>Nymphae</hi> &amp; <hi>labia</hi> of the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,</hi> in order to its defence from outward inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: this <hi>veile</hi> is ſomething retracted in a <hi>Woman</hi> in <hi>coition,</hi> or at leſt forced to retreat by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the <hi>Yard</hi> into the <hi>Orifice</hi> of the <hi>Privity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Suture</hi> or connexion of the <hi>Share-bones</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divided in <hi>Hindes,</hi> or <hi>Does,</hi> and the <hi>leggs</hi> laid wide open, the <hi>Bladder</hi> of <hi>Urine,</hi> and <hi>Vagina Uteri,</hi> or Privity wherein the Yard of the <hi>Male</hi> is enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, as alſo the <hi>neck</hi> of the <hi>Womb,</hi> and its ſcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, are preſently diſcovered, together with the <hi>ligaments</hi> whereby it is faſtened, as likewiſe the <hi>Veines, Arteries,</hi> and <hi>Teſtieles,</hi> as they call them: alſo the <hi>Horns</hi> of the <hi>Womb,</hi> even in theſe creatures, are more remarkable then the other <hi>parts</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>But as for the <hi>preparing,</hi> and the <hi>leading,</hi> or <hi>eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatory veſſels,</hi> there are no ſuch things to be found here; nor (as farre as I know) in any other <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male</hi> whatſoever: And <hi>Anatomiſts</hi> (who ſuppoſe that the <hi>Female</hi> doth emit a <hi>ſeed</hi> in <hi>coition)</hi> make too induſtrious an enquiry after them; for they
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:56144:222"/>
are not at all in ſome; and in thoſe in whom they are, they are never found in the ſame manner, or agreeing. Wherefore it comes neereſt to truth, which alſo (as I have obſerved) the greater part of <hi>Women</hi> acknowledg; namely, that they do not emit any <hi>ſeed</hi> in <hi>coition.</hi> And though the more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious do diſcharge a certain moiſture in <hi>coition,</hi> yet I neither approve it to be fruitfull <hi>ſeed,</hi> nor neceſſarily conducing to <hi>conception;</hi> for very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do conceive without any ſuch effuſion at all: (and ſome alſo without any pleaſure) but of theſe more elſewhere.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Privity,</hi> or <hi>Vagina Uteri,</hi> which is extended from the <hi>outward Orifice</hi> of the <hi>ſecret parts,</hi> to the <hi>inward Orifice</hi> of the <hi>Womb,</hi> is in a <hi>Doe,</hi> as in a <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> ſeated between the <hi>Bladder</hi> of <hi>Urine,</hi> and the <hi>Rectum inteſtinum,</hi> or Right Gut, and is corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent to the Yard of the <hi>male</hi> in form, large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and longitude. And being diſſected, is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to be furrowed with oblong wrinckles and rugoſities, and alſo made glibb and ſlippery with a ſtiffe moyſture. In its bottom, you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a more narrow and cloſed <hi>Orifice,</hi> which is the beginning of the <hi>neck</hi> of the <hi>Uterus,</hi> through which, whatſoever is driven out from the <hi>cavity</hi> of the <hi>Womb,</hi> doth make its paſſage. And this is that <hi>Orifice,</hi> which <hi>Phyſitians</hi> affirm to be ſo cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compreſſed, ſealed up, and concluded in a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and Woman with child, that it will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the point of the fineſt Needle, or Probe.</p>
            <p>After this follows the <hi>Neck,</hi> or <hi>Proceſs</hi> of the <hi>Womb,</hi> which is a much longer and rounder paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in them, then in <hi>Women;</hi> and in its whole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion, from the <hi>bottom</hi> of the <hi>Privity</hi> to the <hi>Womb</hi> it ſelf, is much more <hi>fibrous, thick,</hi> and <hi>nervous,</hi> then theirs. And if you make inciſion into this
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:56144:222"/>
               <hi>Neck,</hi> according to its longitude, you ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover not only its exteriour ingreſs, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous in the bottom of the <hi>Privity,</hi> ſo exactly to connive, and cling together, that the air it ſelf though driven by ones breath, cannot arrive at the cavity of the <hi>Womb;</hi> but alſo five alike ſtreights more ranked in order, blocked up againſt the acceſs of any outward approacher, and ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firmly together by a glewy mucilage: juſt as the moſt compact and narrow <hi>orifice</hi> of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans <hi>Uterus</hi> is locked up by a yellow glutinous ſubſtance. And ſuch narrow ſtreights as theſe, are diſcernable in the <hi>neck</hi> of the <hi>Sheeps, Cowes,</hi> and <hi>Goats</hi> womb, all which are cloſe locked up, and forbid any admittance (which <hi>Fabricius</hi> alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.) But theſe five Receſſes are moſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable in a <hi>Hinde,</hi> and a <hi>Doe,</hi> appearing like ſo many ſeveral <hi>ports</hi> or <hi>orifices</hi> of the <hi>Uterus</hi> tyed up, and ſealed faſt, which you may juſtly eſteem as ſo many Barracadoes oppoſed to the admiſſion of any thing whatſoever. So carefull doth <hi>Nature</hi> ſeem to have been, that in caſe any inſolent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truder ſhould have forced the firſt gate, yet his rudeneſs ſhould be foiled by the next, making like proviſion in the other Avenues, that ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing might infinuate it ſelf into the <hi>womb.</hi> And yet for all this a Probe being put in from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the <hi>Uterus</hi> outwards, doth with eaſe paſs through all theſe ports, and finde a way out. For it was convenient that a paſſage ſhould be affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the diſcharge of <hi>Flatulencies, Menſtruous Blood,</hi> and other <hi>Humours;</hi> but all entrance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred to the entertainment of outward things, though they be never ſo litle (as to the <hi>air</hi> itſelf, or the <hi>Seed.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Uterine Orifice is alike blocked up in all
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:56144:223"/>
other <hi>Animals,</hi> as it is in <hi>Women;</hi> whoſe <hi>womb</hi> we have known ſo cloſed ſometimes, that their <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Purgations after delivery,</hi> and other <hi>humours,</hi> have for want of free disburdening, excited moſt terrible <hi>Hyſterical affections,</hi> inſomuch that I have been fain to invent an inſtrument proper to this inconvenience, whereby the <hi>orifice</hi> of the <hi>womb</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opened, the impriſoned ſuperfluities might be releaſed, and the recited caſualties ſubdued; as alſo that <hi>injections</hi> might finde a reception in the cavity of the <hi>womb,</hi> by which I have ſometimes cured the internal <hi>Ulcers</hi> of the <hi>Matrix,</hi> and alſo <hi>Barrenneſs</hi> it ſelf.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cavity</hi> of the <hi>Uterus</hi> in <hi>Hindes</hi> and <hi>Does,</hi> is exceeding ſmall, as the ſubſtance of the <hi>Uterus</hi> is very litle both in magnitude and thickneſs. For the <hi>womb</hi> in thoſe creatures, is only as a <hi>Porch,</hi> or <hi>Fore-Gate,</hi> in the Cavity whereof lyeth an open way both on the right, and left hand, which lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the <hi>Horns</hi> of the <hi>Womb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For thoſe parts are different in almoſt all other <hi>Animals</hi> which have <hi>Blood,</hi> from what they are in <hi>Women;</hi> in whom the <hi>chief part</hi> of the <hi>womb,</hi> is the <hi>Body</hi> thereof: but the <hi>Neck,</hi> and the <hi>Hornes,</hi> (as being onely Appendixes) are ſcarce diſcernable. For the <hi>Neck</hi> is ſhort, &amp; the <hi>Horns</hi> litle, like round &amp; long <hi>proceſſes,</hi> extended upwards from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the <hi>womb,</hi> like two <hi>Trumpets;</hi> the <hi>Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi> commonly conceiving them to be the <hi>Ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory veſſels.</hi> But in the <hi>Hinde</hi> and <hi>Doe,</hi> as in all other <hi>Viviparous Animals</hi> which have <hi>blood</hi> (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept only <hi>Women, ſhe-Apes,</hi> and thoſe Female <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals</hi> that are <hi>whole-hoofed)</hi> the chief part for <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> is not the <hi>Womb,</hi> but the <hi>Horns</hi> thereof. For in <hi>Women,</hi> and <hi>whole-hoofed Beaſts,</hi> the place of <hi>Conception</hi> is the <hi>Womb,</hi> but in other <hi>Animals,</hi> the
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:56144:223"/>
               <hi>Conception</hi> is accompliſhed in the <hi>Horns</hi> of the <hi>Womb.</hi> And therefore <hi>Authors</hi> generally call thoſe <hi>Horns</hi> by the name of <hi>Uterus,</hi> the <hi>Womb,</hi> ſaying, that the <hi>Womb</hi> in ſome <hi>Animals</hi> is bipartite, and in ſome not; underſtanding thereby the places of <hi>Conception,</hi> which are the <hi>Horns</hi> of the <hi>wombe,</hi> wherein almoſt all <hi>Viviparous Animals, praeſertine multipara,</hi> eſpecially thoſe that bring forth ſeveral young ones at a birth, doe conceive: and unto which alſo all the <hi>Uterine veins</hi> &amp; <hi>arteries</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, and the other <hi>Genital parts</hi> are ſubſervient. Wherefore give us leave alſo, in the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of thoſe <hi>Animals,</hi> to uſe promiſcuouſly the name of <hi>Uterus</hi> or <hi>Womb,</hi> and of <hi>Horns</hi> of the <hi>womb,</hi> for the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>In a Woman, as we have ſaid, the two <hi>Trumpets</hi> neer the <hi>proceſs</hi> of the <hi>Neck</hi> of the <hi>womb,</hi> which are perforated into the <hi>cavity</hi> thereof, are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly reputed proportionable to the <hi>Horns,</hi> but are conceited by ſome <hi>Anatomiſts</hi> to be <hi>Vaſa Sper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matica,</hi> Spermatical Veſſels; by others, <hi>Spiramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Uteri,</hi> the Pores of the <hi>Uterus;</hi> by a third ſort, <hi>Vaſa ſemen deferentia, aut reſervantia,</hi> Leading Veſſels, or Veſſels reſerving the Seed in them. As if they were a certain kinde of <hi>Seminal veſicles;</hi> when, in truth, they are anſwerable in proportion to the <hi>Horns</hi> of the <hi>womb</hi> of other <hi>Animals;</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears clearly, by their ſcituation, connexion, largeneſs, perforation, form, and function: for as other <hi>Animals</hi> do alwaies conceive in the <hi>Horns,</hi> ſo a Woman alſo is ſometimes found to bear her <hi>Foetus in Cornu ſive Tubâ,</hi> in the Horn or Trumpet <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anthrop. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 34.</note> of the womb, as the moſt learned <hi>Riolanus</hi> reports by the obſervation of other men, and I have ſeen with my own eyes.</p>
            <p>Thoſe <hi>Horns</hi> do terminate in the <hi>Common Cavity,</hi>
               <pb n="404" facs="tcp:56144:224"/>
which (like a <hi>Porch</hi> or Threſhold) is ſeated before them both; and is in <hi>Deer</hi> proportionable to the Womans <hi>uterus,</hi> as the trumpets of the Womans <hi>womb,</hi> are proportionable to the Horns of the <hi>Deers womb.</hi> But their denomination they aſſume from their figure; for as the Horns of a <hi>Ram</hi> or <hi>Goat</hi> are large at bottom, jutting out before, and again reflected backward; ſo alſo theſe Horns of the <hi>womb</hi> (in <hi>Hindes</hi> and <hi>Does)</hi> at their original are large and ample, and leſſening by degrees as they look upwards, are at laſt retorted towards the <hi>Spine</hi> of the <hi>Back.</hi> And as thoſe other Horns are inequal, knotty, and wrinkled in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, but behinde appear ſmooth and even; ſo the Horns of the <hi>Deers womb,</hi> are below wrinckled, and gathered, by reaſon of certain cells or rings bunching out, in manner like the <hi>Gut Colon:</hi> but above (where they reſpect the <hi>Spine)</hi> they are ſmooth and even, and recurved, as if they were ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back by a kinde of fillet-like <hi>ligament,</hi> and ſo by degrees grow ſlender as Horns do. If you take an <hi>empty gut</hi> (ſuch a one as puddings are made in) keeping it contract, wrinckled, and ſtreightned, by a tape or fillet which binds it all along on one ſide, you ſhall ſee it curled and diſtinguiſhed into litle cells or windings (after the faſhion of the <hi>Colick Gut.)</hi> And ſuch is the fabrick of the Horns of the <hi>womb</hi> of a <hi>Hinde,</hi> or a <hi>Doe.</hi> In other Females the caſe is different, for they either have larger cells, or none at all. And in theſe Horns of <hi>Hinds</hi> and <hi>Does</hi> alſo, though there be ſeveral cells or windings, yet are not all of equal magnitude, but the firſt is much larger then any of the reſt, and in it chiefly the <hi>Conception</hi> is contained.</p>
            <p>And as in a <hi>Woman,</hi> the <hi>womb,</hi> and its trumpets (or Horns) with the reſt of its appurtenances, are
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:56144:224"/>
tyed faſt to the <hi>Share-bones,</hi> the <hi>Back,</hi> &amp; the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Parts, by the mediation of a broad and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous <hi>Membrane,</hi> (as by a pendulous band or tye) which Anatomiſts do ſtile <hi>Veſpertilionum alas,</hi> the Batts wings; becauſe the <hi>Uterus</hi> hanging in this manner, doth reſemble a <hi>Bat</hi> with its <hi>wings</hi> ſpread abroad: ſo alſo in <hi>Hindes,</hi> and <hi>Does,</hi> the two Horns of the <hi>womb,</hi> together with the Teſticles, and all the Veſſels of the <hi>Uterus,</hi> are by a thick <hi>membrane</hi> faſtened to the circumjacent Parts, (but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the <hi>Back)</hi> which <hi>membrane</hi> performs the ſame office to the <hi>Uterine</hi> Parts, as the <hi>Meſeutery</hi> doth to the Guts, and that which we call the <hi>Meſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrion</hi> doth to the <hi>Uterus</hi> of the <hi>Hen.</hi> For as by the <hi>Meſentery</hi> the <hi>Meſeraick</hi> Veins and Arteries are derived to the Guts; ſo are the <hi>Uterine</hi> Veſſels diſſeminated through the fore-ſaid <hi>membrane:</hi> in which alſo certain ſmall Bladders and Glandules are on both ſides diſcovered, which Glandules <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomiſts</hi> commonly call the Teſticles.</p>
            <p>The ſubſtance of the Horns of the <hi>Hindes</hi> and <hi>Does wombs is cuticular</hi> or <hi>skinny,</hi> or elſe a <hi>fleſhy skin</hi> or <hi>coat</hi> (like that of the Guts) beſprinckled with certain ſlender Veins. This <hi>coat</hi> you may, as <hi>Anatomiſts</hi> uſe to do, divide into ſeveral <hi>coats,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the ſeveral ſcituation of the <hi>fibers,</hi> which ſerve to ſeveral functions, namely to <hi>Retention,</hi> and <hi>Expulſion.</hi> For I have many times ſeen thoſe Horns moving juſt like <hi>Earth-worms;</hi> in the ſame manner as any man may perceive the <hi>Guts,</hi> in an <hi>Animal</hi> newly killed, and the <hi>abdomen</hi> or cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the lower belly laid open, ſtirring to and fro, in a kinde of waving <hi>motion,</hi> whereby (as if they were cloſe begirt and bound in by ſome ſmall narrow ring, or preſſed and ſqueezed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ones fingers) they crowd down and depreſs
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:56144:225"/>
the <hi>Chyle</hi> &amp; <hi>Excrement</hi> towards the inferior Guts.</p>
            <p>All the <hi>Uterine</hi> Veins do here (as in a <hi>woman)</hi> aſſume their original from the <hi>Hollow vein,</hi> neer the <hi>Emulgents:</hi> but the <hi>Arteries</hi> (which they alſo do partake as well as <hi>Women)</hi> do ariſe from the Branches of the <hi>Great Artery,</hi> which paſs into the <hi>Thighes:</hi> and as in a <hi>woman great with child,</hi> the <hi>Uterine</hi> Veſſels which contain <hi>blood,</hi> are more and greater then in the reſt of her body; ſo is it alſo with <hi>Hindes</hi> and <hi>Does</hi> which are with <hi>Fawn.</hi> But the <hi>Arteries</hi> (contrary to that Which we ſee in the reſt of the <hi>body)</hi> are much more numerous for their proportion then the Veines; and being blown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, they will diſtend, &amp; fill their neighbour <hi>veins,</hi> but the <hi>veins</hi> being in the ſame manner blown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, will never do ſo much for them. And this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo I ſee taken notice of by the learned <hi>Riolanus,</hi> and it is a prevalent argument for the <hi>Circulation of the Blood,</hi> which was my Invention; for it doth clearly evince a paſſage from the <hi>Arteries</hi> into the Veins, but no retreat from the Veins into the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries again: &amp; there are likewiſe more Arteries then Veins, becauſe the <hi>foetus</hi> requires great ſtore of ſuſtenance to ſupply his growth, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whereof fewer Veins are ſufficient to return.</p>
            <p>There are alſo Teſticles diſcernable in theſe alſo, as they are in <hi>Sheep, Goat,</hi> and all <hi>Animals</hi> which cleave the <hi>hoofe;</hi> but ſuch Teſticles as reſemble the <hi>Proſtatae,</hi> or <hi>ſeed Glandules,</hi> and the <hi>Kennels</hi> of the <hi>Meſentery</hi> (whoſe office is to ſecure the divarications of the Veins, and retain a moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture in them whereby to keep the parts glib) ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then things deſigned to the concoction of <hi>Prolifical ſeed,</hi> and the Reſervation or treaſuring it up till it be fit for profuſion in the time of <hi>Coi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And this is my opinion of them, both for
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:56144:225"/>
ſundry reaſons elſewhere alledged: as chiefly, becauſe that at the time of <hi>coition</hi> (when the <hi>males</hi> Teſticles are ſwelled with <hi>ſeed,</hi> and full of ſeminal juice) the Horns of the <hi>womb</hi> indeed are in <hi>Hindes</hi> and <hi>Does,</hi> and all other <hi>Viviparous Animals</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they reſide) much altered: but the <hi>Teſticles,</hi> as they call them, (like things utterly unconcerned in the matter of Generation) do neither ſwell, nor differ any way from the conſtitution they were of (either before, or after <hi>coition)</hi> affording no teſtimony at all of their uſe either in reſpect of <hi>Coition,</hi> or <hi>Generation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a wonderfull thing to ſee how great a quantity of <hi>geniture</hi> doth abound in the <hi>Teſticles,</hi> and much diſtended Seminal Veſſels of the very <hi>maſculine Moles,</hi> and <hi>Mice,</hi> about the time of their <hi>coition</hi> (which we have alſo formerly obſerved in the <hi>Dunghill-Cock)</hi> and how vaſt an alteration is eſpyed in the Genitals of both Sexes; and yet theſe <hi>Glandulae,</hi> or litle <hi>Kernels</hi> (which men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be the <hi>Teſticles</hi> of the Females) do ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their wonted appearance, without any vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation at all.</p>
            <p>What we have hitherto obſerved, concerning the <hi>Womb</hi> and the Horns thereof in <hi>Hindes</hi> and <hi>Does,</hi> doth for the moſt part relate alſo to other <hi>Viviparous Animals,</hi> though they differ in a <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;</hi> becauſe ſhe conceives in her womb, but all the reſt in the Horns of the womb, except the <hi>Mare,</hi> and the <hi>ſhe-Aſs;</hi> and even they alſo, though they ſeem to bear their <hi>Conception</hi> in the womb, yet that place of <hi>Conception</hi> doth more reſemble the nature and conſtitution of a <hi>Horn,</hi> then of a <hi>Womb:</hi> for that place is not <hi>bipartite,</hi> but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more oblong,, and different from a <hi>womb,</hi> both in ſcituation, connexion, fabrick, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,

               <hi>Hinds</hi> and <hi>Does</hi> do admit their <hi>Males</hi> at one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet time of the year; that is about the midſt of <hi>September,</hi> after the <hi>Feaſt</hi> of the <hi>Holy Croſs,</hi> and they bring forth after the middeſt of <hi>June,</hi> neer the <hi>Feaſt</hi> of Saint <hi>John Baptiſt.</hi> So that they goe nine moneths, not eight, as <hi>Pliny</hi> would have it: <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>At <hi>Rutting time</hi> the <hi>males</hi> aſſemble themſelves amongſt the <hi>females,</hi> but at other times they feed apart: and the elder <hi>Deere</hi> (as the <hi>Staggs)</hi> do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate with their own <hi>Sex,</hi> and the <hi>Hinds</hi> and <hi>Does</hi> keep company and feed among the other <hi>Hinds</hi> and <hi>Does,</hi> together with the younger ſort of <hi>Ducks,</hi> and <hi>Fawns.</hi> About a whole moneth their
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:56144:226"/>
               <hi>Rutting time</hi> continues, which doth begin later, if the ſeaſon be dry, but if it be moiſt and rainey, ſooner. And therefore in <hi>Spain</hi> (as I am infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) they ſeldom rut before the <hi>Calends</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> becauſe moiſt weather comes not on there til then. But in <hi>England</hi> their <hi>Rutting time</hi> ſeldom laſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the middeſt of <hi>October.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At that time their luſt enrages them ſo, that they will aſſault or <hi>Doggs</hi> or <hi>Men,</hi> when at other times they are ſhie and timorous, and ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be chaſed and put to flight upon the alarme of the leaſt barking <hi>curre</hi> that is.</p>
            <p>Every <hi>Male Deer</hi> knowes all his <hi>Females,</hi> and will not indure any one of them to ſtraggle, but will purſue and bring her back to his <hi>Herd:</hi> and being now grown very jealous of them, he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſurveyes them, and rangeth them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And if perhaps a ſtranger <hi>Doe</hi> intrude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, he is not very paſſionate in her <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion,</hi> but affords her a fair departure: but if another <hi>Male Deere</hi> addreſs himſelf to this <hi>Herd,</hi> he bids him a ſpeedy defiance, and charges him with his <hi>Head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Hind</hi> and <hi>Doe</hi> are numbered amongſt the chaſter rank of <hi>Animals;</hi> becauſe they do not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly admit <hi>Coition</hi> (for the <hi>Stagge</hi> and <hi>Buck,</hi> like the <hi>Bull,</hi> do celebrate their <hi>Coition</hi> with violence) and unleſs they be over-maſtered, or tyred out with aſſaults, they ſhun the act. And this ſeemes to be the cauſe of the aſſembling themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a <hi>Herd</hi> to their own proper mates, and chiefly to thoſe that are the elder <hi>Deere,</hi> and are beſt headed: for if a forraigner attempt their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, they preſently fly to their own <hi>Herd</hi> and conſort, for ſanctuary, as the refuge of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted modeſty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="410" facs="tcp:56144:227"/>
If a young Batchelour <hi>Buck</hi> finde a <hi>Doe</hi> ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling alone, he preſently purſues, and having ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her by his chaſing, he takes advantage of her inability for reſiſtance, and ſo enjoyes her by force.</p>
            <p>All the <hi>Male Deer</hi> provide themſelves a <hi>Rutting place</hi> at ſome diſtance from the <hi>Herd,</hi> by digging up trenches, or ſtanding behind ſome convenient riſe of ground, whither they conſtrain their <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males</hi> to appear. She that is now about the act of <hi>Rutting,</hi> placeth her hinder feet in the furrow or trench provided for the purpoſe, and (if occaſion be) inclining her body doth ſomething depreſs her <hi>Hanches;</hi> by which means the <hi>Stag</hi> or <hi>Buck</hi> may at one inition (as <hi>Bulls</hi> do) preſſing her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, finiſh his affaires.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Elder,</hi> and abler <hi>Stags,</hi> and <hi>Bucks</hi> have a larger <hi>Herd</hi> of <hi>Hinds</hi> and <hi>Does,</hi> then the juniour and infirmer <hi>Deer:</hi> ſome aſſemble to themſelves ten, ſome fifteen.

            <p>When the <hi>Buck</hi> growes firſt ripe for <hi>Rutting,</hi> the <hi>Hair</hi> about his <hi>Throat</hi> and <hi>Neck</hi> growes black; as alſo doth the extremity of his <hi>prepuce,</hi> which doth putrifie likewiſe, and ſtink extreamly.</p>

            <p>WE now come to the Alteration of the <hi>Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts</hi> of the <hi>Hind,</hi> and <hi>Doe,</hi> after <hi>Rutting time,</hi> and alſo to the conception it ſelf.</p>
            <p>In <hi>September,</hi> when the <hi>Hinds</hi> and <hi>Does</hi> firſt <hi>Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting time</hi> is now arrived, their <hi>Uterus</hi> (I mean the <hi>Hornes</hi> of the <hi>Uterus,</hi> or the place wherein they conceive) is become more fleſhy, and thick, and likewiſe more ſoft and tender. In the <hi>cavity</hi> of each of the <hi>Horns</hi> of the <hi>womb</hi> (in that part which reſembleth a wrinckled fillet; namely, where it reflects towards the <hi>ſpine</hi> of the <hi>Back)</hi> five <hi>Carun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> or ſoft <hi>Warts,</hi> or <hi>Nipples,</hi> do jet out, being placed in order: whereof the firſt is the biggeſt of all, and the reſt as they lie in order, are ſtill one leſs then the other; juſt as theſe <hi>Horns</hi> themſelves do leſſen by degrees from the bottom upwards, to the very top. Some of theſe <hi>Caruncles</hi> do grow out as broad as the middle finger, (appearing like a kinde of a luxuriant, fungous, fleſhy ſubſtance) being paler or whiter then ſome, and more ruddy then others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="412" facs="tcp:56144:228"/>
About the ſix and twentieth, or eight and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth day of <hi>September</hi> (as likewiſe afterwards in <hi>October)</hi> the <hi>Uterus</hi> is grown thicker; and the <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runcles</hi> being now more tumid, do reſemble the <hi>Nipples</hi> of Womens Breaſts: ſo that you would believe they were deſigned to yeeld <hi>Milk.</hi> Their top or uppermoſt part being cut away (for I divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the outward <hi>ſuperficies</hi> from them, to diſcover their interiour conſtitution) I beheld them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted and formed out of an innumerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of white points, as out of ſo many briſtles ſet up ſtiff and erect, by a certain mucous viſcidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or glewy ſubſtance, and pinching them hard from the roots upward, between my fore finger and my thumb, I ſqueezed out of each of thoſe white <hi>points</hi> a ſmall drop of <hi>blood.</hi> Whereupon by a more ſtrict enquiry, I diſcovered them to be nothing elſe, but the <hi>Capillary productions</hi> of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſlender <hi>Arteries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At <hi>Rutting time</hi> therefore, the <hi>Uterine Veſſels</hi> (eſpecially the <hi>Arteries)</hi> are diſcovered to be more in number, and more conſpicuous then at other times: Though (as I have noted before) thoſe that are called the <hi>Teſticles,</hi> are neither more large, nor more full then they were before, nor any thing changed from their priſtine conſtitution.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cavity</hi> of the <hi>Uterus</hi> (that is, of the <hi>Hornes</hi> of the <hi>Uterus)</hi> and interiour ſuperficies thereof (which you may call the wall of the litle <hi>Cells)</hi> preſents it ſelfe exceeding ſoft and glibbe to the touch, like to the interiour concameration of the <hi>Ventricles</hi> of the <hi>Braine,</hi> or the fleſh of the <hi>Nut</hi> of the <hi>Yard,</hi> which is within the <hi>Prepuce.</hi> But in that <hi>Cavity,</hi> I could never diſcover any <hi>Sperme</hi> ejected from the <hi>Male Deere,</hi> nor any other thing which relates to the <hi>conception,</hi> (though I have made

moſt accurate diſſection through all the entire moneths of <hi>September</hi> and <hi>October.)</hi> And yet the <hi>Male Deere</hi> did go to rut daily, and I diſſected a great number of <hi>Does.</hi> And this is the reſult of many years experience.</p>
            <p>I have ſeen indeed in ſome the <hi>Caruncles</hi> ſo neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeated the one to the other, as if they had made one continued <hi>protuberance</hi> out of all the five uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together. And when upon frequent experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I never met with any other thing within the <hi>Cavity</hi> of the <hi>Uterus,</hi> I began at firſt to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whether the <hi>maſculine ſeed</hi> could by any means (namely either by way of <hi>Injection,</hi> or <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction)</hi> inſinuate itſelf into the ſeat of Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? and at laſt my many repeated obſervations did ratifie this concluſion, namely, that no part or portion of the <hi>ſeed</hi> doth ever enter into thoſe receptacles.</p>

            <p>HAving made ſeveral diſſections in the month of <hi>October,</hi> as well before the expiration of the <hi>Rutting time,</hi> as after: I could never finde any <hi>ſeed,</hi> or <hi>blood,</hi> or the <hi>track</hi> of any other thing whatſoever, in the <hi>cavity</hi> of the <hi>Uterus.</hi> Onely the <hi>Womb</hi> or <hi>Uterus</hi> was grown larger and thicker, and the <hi>Caruncles</hi> more tumid and florid then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and out of them upon a cloſe conſtriction
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:56144:229"/>
or pinching them between the fingers, ſome ſmall drops of <hi>blood</hi> did iſſue out, as a <hi>watery kinde of milk</hi> is expreſſed out of the <hi>nipples</hi> of the <hi>breaſts</hi> of ſuch as are with <hi>Childe,</hi> about the fourth moneth of their <hi>pregnation.</hi> In the <hi>Uterus</hi> of one, or two, which was exceedingly impated and extenuated contrary to the courſe of <hi>Nature,</hi> I found indeed a kinde of a green, ichorous putrified ſubſtance, like to impoſtumated matter, filling the <hi>cavity</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; whereas thoſe very <hi>Does</hi> were in all other points ſound, and ſomething fat, no leſs then their fellowes which I diffected at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>About the End of <hi>October,</hi> and the Beginning of <hi>November,</hi> when the <hi>Rutting time</hi> is now conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the <hi>Females</hi> and <hi>Males</hi> part company: the <hi>Uterus</hi> began to ſeem of a leſſer <hi>bulk</hi> (in ſome ſooner, and in others later) and the wall or ſides of the inner <hi>cavity</hi> appeared to tumefie, as if it were puffed up; for in thoſe places where of late the <hi>litle Cells</hi> were, there did now round <hi>gobbets</hi> extuberate inwards, filling almoſt the whole <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity:</hi> ſo that the ſides now ſeemed to touch one another, and glewed as it were together, leaving no ſpace vacant between them. For as licoriſh Boyes (while they plunder the <hi>honey-combs,</hi> that they may greedily devour the <hi>honey)</hi> have their <hi>Lips</hi> ſo ſtung by the <hi>Bees,</hi> that they ſwell and grow tumerous, and ſo ſtreighten the gap of their Mouths; in the ſame manner doth the interiour <hi>ſuperficies</hi> of the <hi>Does Uterus</hi> become turgid, and a moſt ſoft and pulpous ſubſtance (like that of the <hi>Braine)</hi> doth fill the <hi>cavity,</hi> and involve the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runcles</hi> in it. And as for the <hi>Caruncles</hi> themſelves, they are no bigger then they were before, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear ſomething paler, and as it were madera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or ſtewed in warm water, as the Nurſes nipples
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:56144:229"/>
look preſently after the Childe hath had the breaſt. But I could not ſqueeze out any blood from them, as before.</p>
            <p>This interiour ſuperficies of the <hi>Uterus</hi> being thus ſwolne; it is at that time ſo tender and ſmooth, as nothing can be more. It reſembles the ſoftneſs of the <hi>brain</hi> it ſelf, and when you touch it, did not your own eyes give evidence to that touch, you would not believe your fingers vere upon it. The <hi>cavity</hi> of the <hi>Womb</hi> being laied open immediately after the killing of the <hi>Deere,</hi> I have often diſcovered a ſlow waving motion, (ſuch a one as is ſeen in the bottom of a creeping <hi>Snailes</hi> belly) as if the <hi>Womb</hi> were <hi>Animal in Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mali,</hi> one living creature in another; and had a peculiar independent motion of its own.</p>
            <p>Such a kind of motion as this, I have (as I mentioned but now) often obſerved in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines of creatures diſſected alive: &amp; the ſame may be experimented both by the teſtimony of the ſight and touch, in live <hi>Dogs</hi> and <hi>Conies,</hi> though you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect them not. I have likewiſe obſerved the ſame kind of motion, in the <hi>Teſticles</hi> and <hi>Scrotum</hi> of the <hi>Males;</hi> and I have known ſome <hi>Women,</hi> whom ſuch palpitations have deluded with the hopes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Child. But whether in Hyſterical affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (ſuch as are the <hi>Aſcent, deſcent,</hi> &amp; <hi>contortion</hi> of the <hi>Uterus)</hi> the <hi>Womb</hi> of <hi>Women</hi> move and ſtir by ſuch a kind of agitation; as whether the <hi>Braine</hi> alſo in its <hi>conceptions</hi> be in like manner moved to and fro, as the diſcovery is very difficult, ſo is it vorthy the attempt.</p>
            <p>A little while after the foreſaid <hi>Extuberance</hi> of the interiour <hi>coat</hi> of the <hi>Uterus</hi> begins to ſhrink, and leſſen: and in ſome, (but that is rare,) a certain <hi>purulent matter</hi> doth ſtick to the fides, (in
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:56144:230"/>
manner of ſweat) ſuch as is viſible in wounds, and ulcers, when they are ſaid to be <hi>Concocted,</hi> and caſt forth a white, ſmooth, and equall matter. When I firſt diſcovered this kind of ſubſtance, I was in ſuſpence, whether I ſhould conceit it to be the ſeed of the <hi>Male,</hi> or ſome <hi>concocted ſubſtance</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from it. But becauſe I did obſerve this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter but ſeldom, and in few onely, and alſo ſeeing twenty days were now paſt, ſince any commerce with the <hi>male</hi> had been celebrated, and likewiſe for as much as this <hi>ſubſtance</hi> was not thick, clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or froathy, (as <hi>ſeed</hi> is) but more friable and purulent, inclining to yellow, I concluded that it arrived thither caſually rather, or elſe procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from over much ſweat, the <hi>Deere</hi> being new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quite ſpent in the chace: and ſo in a <hi>Rheume</hi> falling down into the <hi>Noſe,</hi> the thinner portion of the <hi>Catarrh</hi> being thickened into a mucous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, puts on a yellow complexion.</p>
            <p>This alteration in the Womb when I had often diſcovered to His Majeſties ſight (as the firſt aſſay towards <hi>impregnation)</hi> and having likewiſe plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewed that all this while no portion of <hi>ſeed,</hi> or <hi>conception</hi> either was to be found in the <hi>Womb;</hi> and when the King himſelf had communicated the ſame as a very wonderful thing to diverſe of his followers, a great debate at length aroſe: The Keepers and the Huntſmen concluded, firſt, that this did imply, that their conception would be late that year, &amp; thereupon accuſed the drougth; but afterwards when they underſtood that the <hi>rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting time</hi> was paſt, and gone; and that I ſtood ſtiffly upon that, they peremptorily did affirm, that I was firſt miſtaken my ſelfe, and ſo had drawn the King into my error; and that it could not poſſibly be, but that ſomething at leſt of the
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:56144:230"/>
Conception muſt needs appear in the <hi>Uterus:</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till at laſt, being confuted by their own eyes, they ſate down in a gaze and gave it over for granted. But all the Kings Phyſitians perſiſted ſtiffly, that it could no waies be, that a conception ſhould go forward unleſs the <hi>males ſeed</hi> did remain in the womb, and that there ſhould be nothing at all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding in the <hi>Vterus</hi> after a fruitfull and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Coition; this they ranked amongſt their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>Now that this experiment which is of ſo great concern might appear the more evident to poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; His Majeſtie for tryal-ſake (becauſe they have all the ſame time and manner of concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) did at the beginning of <hi>October</hi> ſeparate about a dozen <hi>Does</hi> from the ſociety of the <hi>Buck,</hi> and lock them up in the Courſe neer <hi>Hampton Court.</hi> Now leſt any one might affirm that doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesſly theſe did continue the <hi>ſeed</hi> beſtowed upon them in <hi>Coition</hi> (their time of <hi>Rutting</hi> being then not paſt) I diſſected diverſe of them, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered no ſeed at all reſiding in their <hi>Vterus:</hi> and yet thoſe whom I diſſected not, did conceive by the virtue of their former <hi>Coition</hi> (as by <hi>Contagion)</hi> and did <hi>Fawn</hi> at their appointed time.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Bitches, Conies,</hi> and ſeveral other <hi>Animals,</hi> I have certainly diſcovered, that nothing after <hi>Coi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is to be found in their <hi>Vterus,</hi> for many daies together. In ſo much that I am very well aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that in <hi>Viviparous,</hi> (as well as in <hi>Oviparous</hi> creatures) the <hi>Foetus</hi> doth neither proceed from the <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female</hi> emitted in <hi>Coi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> nor yet from any commixture of that <hi>ſeed,</hi> (as the Phyſitians will have it) nor yet out of the <hi>Menſtruous blood,</hi> as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> conceits; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that there is not any thing of the conception
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:56144:231"/>
neceſſarily in being, preſently after <hi>Coition.</hi> And hence it follows, that it is not true, that in a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifical coition,</hi> any matter is ready at hand in the <hi>Vterus,</hi> which matter or ſubſtance, the <hi>Maſculine ſeed</hi> ſhould concoct, coagulate and faſhion, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce into an actual generation, or by drying its outward Superficies, Form, and After-birth to wrap it in. For nothing at all is to be found in the <hi>Womb</hi> for many days together, even to the twelfth of <hi>November.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is alſo evident, that all <hi>Females,</hi> in the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>coition,</hi> do not effund a ſeed into the <hi>Vterus;</hi> for neither in Hinds, or Does, or ſeveral other <hi>Vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parous Animals,</hi> is there any track or ſigne of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Seed,</hi> or <hi>Menſtruous blood.</hi> But what it may be, which flowes from ſome ſalacious <hi>Women</hi> in <hi>Coiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> as well as from <hi>Men,</hi> which procures plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to them, and a kind of reſolution of their <hi>Spirits;</hi> as alſo whether it do neceſſarily conduce to the <hi>Conception;</hi> likewiſe whether it do proceed from the <hi>Teſticles,</hi> or whether it bee <hi>ſeed,</hi> and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>prolifical</hi> or not, we have elſewhere diſcovered.</p>
            <p>And while I am in this diſcourſe, let the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious bear with me, (if being mindful of my great wrongs) I let ſlip a ſigh or two, grounded upon this my misfortune: namely, that while I did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon our late Sovereign in theſe late diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and more then Civil Wars; (and that not by the Parliaments bare permiſſion, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand) ſome rapacious hand or other not onely ſpoiled me of all my Goods; but alſo (which I moſt lament) have bereft me of my Notes, which coſt me many years induſtry. By which meant, many obſervations (eſpecially thoſe concerning) the <hi>Generation</hi> of <hi>Inſects)</hi> are loſt and imberelled to the prejudice (I may boldly ſay it) of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of Learning.</p>

In <hi>Hinds</hi> alſo, which go to <hi>Rut</hi> ſix or ſeven days before the <hi>Does,</hi> I have ſtill diſcovered ſome track of the future <hi>conception,</hi> about the eighth or nineth day of <hi>November.</hi> But what that is, and how it doth begin, I ſhall now declare.</p>
            <p>A litle before any thing at all is to be ſeen, the ſubſtance of the <hi>Vterus,</hi> or <hi>Hornes</hi> appear leſſer, then when the <hi>females</hi> firſt went to <hi>Rut;</hi> and the white <hi>Caruncles</hi> are more flaggy (as I informed you before;) and the <hi>protuberance</hi> of the inward <hi>that</hi> doth a litle abate, growing more wrinckled, and moiſt. For about the time aforeſaid, ſome certain mucous <hi>filaments</hi> (like the <hi>Spiders threads)</hi> are led from the laſt or upper angle of the <hi>Hornes</hi> of the <hi>Vterus,</hi> through the midſt of both the <hi>Horns,</hi> and alſo through the <hi>cavity</hi> of the <hi>Womb,</hi> which being joined together, do reſemble a membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>A day or two being now over, this <hi>wallet</hi> is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with a watry, white, ſtiff, albugineous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and being ſtuffed with that moiſture, doth reſemble a <hi>long pudding,</hi> ſticking or cleaving a litle to the conteining ſides of the <hi>Vterus</hi> by its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour glutinoſity; and yet ſo, that it may be eaſily ſeparated from them: for being taken in the narrow part of the <hi>Vterus</hi> (where it is tied to it as it paſſeth along) it may be brought away entire from both the <hi>Hornes,</hi> if it be warily hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Conception</hi> now grown, and taken out, is of the figure of a <hi>wallet,</hi> or <hi>double pudding:</hi> being beſmeared on the outſide with a kind of purulent filth; but within it is glibbe, conteining in it a <hi>ſtiff moiſture,</hi> much like to the more <hi>liquid White</hi> of an <hi>Egge.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Both theſe humors are in the <hi>Conceptions</hi> of all <hi>Viviparous Animals;</hi> which many men conceive to be the <hi>Excrements</hi> of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> deeming the one to be its <hi>urine,</hi> the other its <hi>ſweat;</hi> when not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they have no offenſive taſte at all, and are alwayes moſt manifeſt in the <hi>Conception,</hi> even before any particle of the <hi>foetus</hi> is diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>

over both the <hi>Horns</hi> of the <hi>uterus;</hi> the later, ſwimming in the firſt <hi>water,</hi> and contained onely in one of the <hi>Horns,</hi> except there be a <hi>Twin-foetus;</hi> in which caſe, there is one in each of the <hi>Horns:</hi> as in the <hi>Gemellifical Egge</hi> there are two <hi>Colliquamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tums.</hi> So that where there is a double <hi>foetus,</hi> they are both contained in one and the ſame <hi>conception,</hi> together with their two-fold cryſtalline <hi>waters:</hi> (as in one and the ſame <hi>Egg.)</hi> If you make an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion into any part of the <hi>Exteriour membrane,</hi> the more impure <hi>water</hi> will preſently iſſue out from both the <hi>Horns;</hi> but the cryſtalline <hi>water,</hi> which is comprehended in the interiour <hi>membrane</hi> called <hi>Amnion,</hi> doth not flow forth with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, unleſs you have peirced it alſo.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vein,</hi> which is firſt ſeen within the <hi>Amnion,</hi> in the cryſtalline <hi>humour,</hi> takes its original from the <hi>Punctum ſaliens;</hi> exerciſing the <hi>office,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>Umbilical Veſſels;</hi> and being by degrees enlarged, it is <hi>diſſeminated</hi> into other <hi>ramifications,</hi> which are ſcattered into the <hi>Colliquamentum:</hi> whereby it is moſt evident, that the <hi>nutriment</hi> is at firſt attracted from the <hi>Colliqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum</hi> only, wherein the <hi>Foetus</hi> ſwims.</p>
            <p>Having diſſected the <hi>uterus,</hi> I have expoſed this <hi>Punctum ſaliens,</hi> while it yet continued its palpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to the view of our late dread <hi>Soveraigne;</hi> which was then ſo ſmall, that without the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Sun-beams obliquely illuſtrating it, he could not have perceived its ſhivering motion.</p>
            <p>The entire <hi>Colliquamentum</hi> being caſt into a ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or tinn-Baſon, which is full of clear warm <hi>water,</hi> doth very neatly lay open the <hi>Punctum ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liens</hi> to the eye. To which, in the following dayes, a certain gelly, like a litle worm, in the form of a <hi>Magot,</hi> is adjoined, (as being the firſt platform of
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:56144:234"/>
the future <hi>body)</hi> divided into two parts; of one part whereof the <hi>Trunk</hi> is conſtituted, &amp; the <hi>Head</hi> of the other: in the very ſame manner, as hath been formerly delivered in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Hen-egg.</hi> The <hi>Spine</hi> of the <hi>Back</hi> is a litle inflected in manner of a <hi>Keel;</hi> the <hi>Head</hi> is imperfectly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of three ſmall <hi>veſicles,</hi> or <hi>litle balls,</hi> and ſwimming in the <hi>Cryſtalline water,</hi> doth dayly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large, and grow into ſhape: With this difference onely, that the <hi>Eyes</hi> are much larger, and more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in <hi>Oviparous,</hi> then in <hi>Viviparous productions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the ſix and twentieth day of <hi>November,</hi> the <hi>foetus</hi> is diſcerned, having his whole <hi>body</hi> almoſt compleat, being found without diſtinction, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeated in the <hi>Right,</hi> and ſometimes in the <hi>Left horn</hi> of the <hi>Vterus:</hi> but where there is a <hi>Twin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foetus,</hi> there is one of them placed in each of the <hi>Horns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And at this time the <hi>Male</hi> is diſtinguiſhable from the <hi>Female</hi> by his <hi>Genital parts;</hi> which are conſpicuous in a humane <hi>Embryo,</hi> ſo ſoon as ever the <hi>rough Artery</hi> doth appear.</p>
            <p>You ſhall finde the <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female</hi> ſometimes in the <hi>Right,</hi> and ſometimes in the <hi>Left horn,</hi> meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as it falleth out. But yet the <hi>Male</hi> is more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently diſcovered in the <hi>Left,</hi> and the <hi>Female</hi> in the <hi>Right horn,</hi> and this frequently in <hi>Does,</hi> which have <hi>Twins</hi> within them, and I once alſo obſerved it in an <hi>Ewe.</hi> Whence I am confirmed, that the proper conſtitution, or peculiar virtue of either <hi>ſide,</hi> doth ſignifie nothing to the <hi>diſcrimination</hi> of the <hi>Sex.</hi> Nor is the <hi>uterus</hi> the Fabricatour or former of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> no, nor the mother her ſelf, any more then the <hi>Hen</hi> is the framer of the <hi>Chicken</hi> in the <hi>Egge</hi> whereon ſhe ſitteth. But as the <hi>Chicken</hi> is made in the <hi>Egge</hi> by an <hi>internal formative Agent,</hi>
               <pb n="425" facs="tcp:56144:234"/>
ſo likewiſe is the <hi>foetus</hi> conſtituted out of this <hi>Egge</hi> of the <hi>Doe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A man would admire to ſee the <hi>Foetus</hi> formed and compleated in the <hi>Amnion,</hi> in ſo ſmall a time after the firſt riſe and beginning of the <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Punctum ſaliens.</hi> For about the nineteenth or twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth day of <hi>November,</hi> that <hi>Point</hi> makes his firſt appearance: about the one and twentieth or two and twentieth day, the litle unſhapen <hi>Worme</hi> or <hi>Maggot</hi> diſcovers it ſelf: but within ſix or ſeven daies after that, the <hi>Foetus</hi> is ſo compleat, that you may diſtinguiſh the <hi>Male</hi> from the <hi>Female,</hi> (by the <hi>Genital parts)</hi> and perceive the <hi>feet</hi> formed, and the <hi>little hoofes</hi> cleft, being then like <hi>Gelly,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inclining to yellow.</p>
            <p>So ſoon as ever the <hi>foetus</hi> begins to be formed and grow, the ſubſtance of the <hi>Uterus</hi> is much extenuated: contrary to the cuſtom of it in <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> whoſe <hi>Womb</hi> according to the increaſe of the <hi>Foetus</hi> becomes thicker, and more fleſhy. For in <hi>Hinds,</hi> and <hi>Does,</hi> how much the more the <hi>foetus</hi> augmenteth, ſo much the <hi>Hornes</hi> of the <hi>Uterus</hi> approach neerer to the ſhape of the <hi>Guts:</hi> and chiefly that <hi>Horne,</hi> wherein the <hi>Foetus</hi> doth reſide, doth reſemble a <hi>little wallet,</hi> though in its extent and capacity it exceed the other.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Egge</hi> or <hi>Conception,</hi> doth as yet on no ſide adhere, or grow faſt to the <hi>Matrix</hi> (though the <hi>foetus</hi> is now compleat) but may bee very eaſily drawn away whole; as I have tried it in an <hi>Ewe,</hi> which bore a <hi>foetus</hi> in her <hi>Womb,</hi> almoſt the length of my <hi>Thumb.</hi> Wherefore it is moſt apparent, that the <hi>foetus</hi> is yet onely nouriſhed by the <hi>White,</hi> which is ſhut up with it in the <hi>Conception,</hi> as it hath been obſerved in the <hi>Hen-egge</hi> before; for the <hi>Orifices</hi> of the <hi>Umbilical Veſſels</hi> are quite obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:56144:235"/>
between the <hi>White</hi> of the <hi>Conception,</hi> and the adjacent <hi>humours</hi> with their <hi>membranes;</hi> not being any where as yet faſtned to the <hi>Uterus</hi> it ſelf, though thoſe <hi>Veins</hi> or <hi>Veſſels</hi> onely are the convoy to adminiſter nouriſhment to the <hi>foetus.</hi> And as in an <hi>Egge</hi> the <hi>propagations</hi> of the <hi>Veins</hi> are firſt diſſeminated into the <hi>Colliquamentum;</hi> (as the <hi>roots</hi> of <hi>plants</hi> are into the <hi>ground)</hi> and are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards communicated to the <hi>exteriour Membrane</hi> (called the <hi>Chorion)</hi> and do diſpatch their <hi>bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> up and down with innumerable <hi>divarications</hi> through the <hi>albugineous humour</hi> conteined in the utmoſt membrane, that ſo they may forage, and provide <hi>Aliment:</hi> ſo likewiſe in <hi>humane abortions,</hi> I have plainly diſcovered the <hi>vein</hi> in the <hi>Chorion;</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf affirmed, that <hi>that coat was full</hi>

            <p>If there be a ſingle <hi>foetus,</hi> the <hi>diſtribution</hi> of its <hi>Umbilical veſſels</hi> is extended to both the <hi>Hornes</hi> of the <hi>Womb</hi> (having litle <hi>branches</hi> diſſeminated through the <hi>cavity</hi> thereof) that ſo it may attract <hi>aliment</hi> on both ſides.

            </p>
            <p>Now, about the end of <hi>November,</hi> all the <hi>parts</hi> are clear and diſtinct, and the <hi>foetus</hi> now appears of the magnitude of a large <hi>Beane,</hi> or a <hi>Nutmeg:</hi> the hinder part of his Head being a litle promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, as it is in a <hi>Chicken,</hi> but his Eyes are leſſe. His Mouth lies gaping wide even from Ear to Ear:
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:56144:235"/>
for the Cheeks and Lips are laſt of all perfected, as being <hi>cutaneous parts.</hi> So that in all Productions (even in <hi>humane</hi> alſo) the ſlit of the Mouth is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated as far as the Ears on both ſides, having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lips nor Cheeks to abate it.

            <p>I have often times caſt the <hi>foetus,</hi> when it was now grown to the quantity of a <hi>fair Bean,</hi> being tranſparent under his <hi>coat Amnios,</hi> and ſwimming in his moſt pure <hi>alinient,</hi> into a <hi>ſilver baſon</hi> full of the cleareſt <hi>water,</hi> whereby I diſcovered chiefly theſe moſt remarkable following things.

There were alſo in the ſame <hi>coat</hi> an infinite number of <hi>Umbilical propagations</hi> which had no connexion at all to the <hi>Uterus:</hi> as we have noted in <hi>Deer</hi> alſo, and after the ſame manner, as we have deſcribed them in the <hi>outward membrane</hi> of the <hi>Hen-egge.</hi> There were onely preſent two <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,</hi> and as many <hi>coats</hi> conteining them: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the <hi>exteriour</hi> called <hi>Chorion</hi> was extended over both the <hi>Horns,</hi> and being full of a more turbid <hi>humour,</hi> did faſhion or ſhape the <hi>egge,</hi> or <hi>concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> But the <hi>coat</hi> called <hi>Amnios,</hi> was almoſt inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (like that <hi>coat</hi> of the <hi>Eye</hi> which is called <hi>Arach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noides,</hi> or the <hi>Cobweb,</hi> being the <hi>membrane</hi> of the <hi>Cryſtalline humour)</hi> conteining in it a clear bright <hi>Water</hi> like <hi>Cryſtal,</hi> wherein this <hi>foetus</hi> of the <hi>Ewe</hi> did ſwim.</p>

            <p>In a <hi>Woman with childe,</hi> who dyed of a <hi>Feaver,</hi> I found an <hi>Hermaphrodite Embryo</hi> of almoſt the ſame bigneſs.

            <p>The <hi>Conception</hi> or <hi>Egge,</hi> by the mediation of the five <hi>Caruncles</hi> in each <hi>Horn,</hi> (formerly ſpoken of) is in five ſeveral places adjoined and faſtned to the <hi>Uterus,</hi> yet not ſo firmly neither, but that a ſmall force will disjoin them again.

               <hi>Umbilical Veſſels</hi> doth derive to himſelf ſuch <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> as his Mother affords him: as ſhall appear hereafter.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Magnitude</hi> and <hi>capacity</hi> of the <hi>Vterus</hi> (under which name we underſtand the <hi>Hornes</hi> of the <hi>Vte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus;</hi> namely the places of <hi>conception)</hi> do enlarge according to the growth of the <hi>foetus,</hi> but yet ſo, that, that <hi>Horn</hi> wherein the <hi>foetus</hi> ſetleth his abode, is larger then the other.</p>
            <p>Their <hi>conception</hi> or <hi>egge</hi> is one onely; whether they produce a ſingle, or diverſe <hi>Foetus:</hi> and that ſingle <hi>conception</hi> is dilated over both the <hi>Horns;</hi> ſo that it looks like a brace of <hi>puddings,</hi> or rather like one onely, and that tied in the middle, as hath been formerly ſaid: for paſſing along ſlender, and round, from the fartheſt part of the <hi>Horne</hi> on one ſide, it doth by degrees enlarge, and ſo goeth on to that common place, which in a Woman we call the <hi>Womb</hi> and <hi>Matrix</hi> or Mother; (becauſe a <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> in that part is made a Mother, by conceiving and foſtering a <hi>foetus</hi> in it) where it is ſtreightned as if it paſſed through an <hi>Iſthmus;</hi> and being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain dilated, as it arriveth at the other <hi>Horn,</hi> it proceedeth ſtill on to the fartheſt extremity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of likewiſe; where growing leſs, and pointed (as it did at the beginning) it erects its <hi>non Vltra,</hi> and proceeds no farther. Therefore theſe kind of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,</hi> if they be drawn away entire, do reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a <hi>wallet</hi> whoſe both ends are full of <hi>Water:</hi> and thence alſo that <hi>coat chorion,</hi> is likewiſe called <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantoides;</hi> becauſe the <hi>conceptions</hi> of ſuch Animals reſemble a <hi>Gut</hi> blown up, or <hi>ſtuffed pudding,</hi> which is tied faſt in the midſt.</p>
            <p>If you diſſect an <hi>Embryo</hi> at this time, you ſhall diſcern all the interiour parts diſtinct, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat: but chiefly the <hi>Stomack,</hi> the <hi>Heart,</hi> and

But the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of theſe <hi>Lungs</hi> is more ruddy, then of thoſe which have at any time breathed; becauſe the <hi>Lungs</hi> ſtretched and dilated by the <hi>Air,</hi> put on a whiter colour.

            <p>In the <hi>Stomack</hi> of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> there is found a watery ſubſtance, (not unlike that wherein he (ſwims) but ſomething more troubled, and leſs tranſparent: like to that <hi>milk</hi> which is dreined out of <hi>Womens breaſts,</hi> that are about four or five moneths gone, or like <hi>white Poſſet</hi> as we call it.</p>

The <hi>Scull</hi> is partly <hi>cartilagineous,</hi> and partly <hi>bony.</hi> The Hoofs are yellowiſh, flexile, and ſoft (juſt as the Hoofs of grown <hi>Deere</hi> are, being mollified in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing water) the Caruncles, now very great, (as large <hi>Muſhroomes)</hi> are ſpred over the whole <hi>cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of the <hi>Uterus,</hi> and do evidently ſupply the uſe of an <hi>After-birth:</hi> for ſeveral propagations and thoſe large ones too, are from the <hi>Umbilical</hi> Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels diſſeminated into them, that ſo they may derive aliment to the <hi>foetus:</hi> in like manner as in thoſe that are already in the world, the <hi>chyle</hi> is tranſported by the <hi>Meſeraick branches</hi> into the <hi>Gate vain</hi> of the <hi>Liver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In whatſoever <hi>Conception</hi> of this kind, there is but one onely <hi>foetus,</hi> there the <hi>Umbilical veſſels</hi> are conveied to all the <hi>caruncles:</hi> (as well of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite, as the ſame ſide) but in that conception where there is a double <hi>foetus,</hi> there the <hi>ramificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of the <hi>Vmbilical veſſels</hi> relating to each <hi>foetus,</hi> are not propagated beyond the <hi>caruncles</hi> of the ſame ſide wherein it reſideth.</p>
            <p>The <hi>leſſer Vmbilical veins</hi> as they reſpect the <hi>foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> do where they unite and join together deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and end in other greater Veins; and thoſe again paſſing farther on, and uniting, do conclude
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:56144:241"/>
in Veins yet greater then themſelves, till at the laſt they conſtitute <hi>two truncks,</hi> which being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, do convey <hi>Blood</hi> into the <hi>Hollow,</hi> and <hi>Gate Vein.</hi> But the <hi>Vmbilical Arteries</hi> (ariſing from the branches of the <hi>deſcending Trunk</hi> of the <hi>great Artery.)</hi> are <hi>two,</hi> and thoſe very <hi>ſmall</hi> ones, and ſuch as were it not for their <hi>pulſe,</hi> could ſcarce be diſcerned, which being carried along, to the capacity or ſuperficies of the <hi>conception)</hi> where the <hi>caruncles</hi> or <hi>After-birth</hi> meet the <hi>propagations</hi> of the Veins) do firſt diminiſh or leſſen into <hi>capillary threads,</hi> and at laſt become quite inviſible, and are clean expunged.</p>
            <p>As in the <hi>Vterus</hi> the Extremities of the <hi>Vmbilical veſſels</hi> are terminated into the <hi>caruncles,</hi> ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe out of the <hi>Vterus,</hi> the <hi>Vterine veſſels</hi> (which are many, and large) carrying <hi>blood</hi> from the <hi>Mother</hi> to the <hi>Womb</hi> (by the conduct of the <hi>ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory ligaments)</hi> do terminate outwardly in thoſe very <hi>caruncles.</hi> We are alſo to take notice, that the <hi>Interiour veſſels,</hi> are all of them Veins, for the moſt part: but the <hi>Exteriour</hi> are for the moſt the propagations of <hi>Arteries.</hi> In the Womans <hi>After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burden,</hi> if you mind it well, preſently after ſhe is delivered, are many more Arteries then Veines, and alſo larger too, which are diſſeminated with almoſt innumerable propagations up and down, even to its utmoſt <hi>ſuperficies.</hi> As alſo in the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> or <hi>Affuſion</hi> of the <hi>Spleen,</hi> which is not unlike it, the number of the Arteries exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that of the Veins.</p>
            <p>The <hi>exteriour Vterine veſſels</hi> do, as I ſay, tend towards the <hi>Matrix,</hi> and towards the <hi>Teſticles,</hi> which are ſeated in the <hi>ſuſpenſory ligament;</hi> as ſome men imagine.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Gibbous</hi> or <hi>convex part</hi> of the <hi>caruncles,</hi>
               <pb n="439" facs="tcp:56144:241"/>
which reſpect the <hi>Matrix,</hi> I have obſerved a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful contrivance in <hi>Nature:</hi> For in diverſe of the Cavities, and <hi>Cotyledones,</hi> or Orifices of the veſſels gaping outwards, I found a <hi>white mucila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous ſubſtance,</hi> which did fill up the <hi>whole body</hi> of the <hi>caruncle,</hi> (as the <hi>Honey</hi> ſtuffs up the <hi>Honey-comb)</hi> and was of a complexion, conſiſtence, and taſt much like the <hi>White</hi> of an <hi>Egge.</hi> But if you pluck a ſunder the <hi>conception</hi> from the <hi>caruncles,</hi> you ſhall preſently deſcry ſo many <hi>ſpriggs,</hi> or <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillary branches</hi> of the <hi>Vmbilical</hi> veſſels (which look like long threads or filaments) to be drawn out alſo from every one of the <hi>Cotyledones,</hi> and Combs as it were, and out of their <hi>mucous ſubſtance:</hi> juſt as Herbs plucked up from the Earth, have their Roots trailing after them.</p>
            <p>By which it is evident, that the Extremities of the <hi>Vmbilical</hi> veſſels, are no way conjoined to the <hi>Vterine</hi> veſſels by an <hi>Anaſtomôſis;</hi> nor do extract <hi>blood</hi> from them, but are terminated in that <hi>white mucilaginous matter,</hi> and are quite obliterated in it, attracting nouriſhment from it; after the ſelf ſame manner, as they did formerly draw <hi>Aliment</hi> from the <hi>white moiſture</hi> or <hi>ſap,</hi> which was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded within the membranes of the conception. And as the <hi>chicken</hi> in the <hi>Hen-egge</hi> is ſuſteined by the <hi>White</hi> attracted by its <hi>Vmbilical</hi> veſſels; ſo the Conception alſo of Hinds and Does, is nouriſhed with a <hi>white ſubſtance</hi> like to that, which is ſtored up in theſe litle Cells, and not with <hi>blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore theſe Caruncles may be juſtly ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Vterine cakes,</hi> or <hi>dugs:</hi> that is to ſay, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient and proportionate Organs or Inſtruments deſigned for the concocting of that Albuginous Aliment, and for preparing it for the attraction of the Veins. And therefore thoſe Viviparous A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:56144:242"/>
which have not theſe Caruncles or After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth; (as the <hi>Mare,</hi> and the <hi>Sow</hi> have none) their <hi>foetus</hi> is ſuſteined even till the hour of their <hi>birth,</hi> with the humours which are conteined in the Conception onely; and their conception doth no where adhere or grow to the <hi>Vterus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is therefore manifeſt in thoſe, and alſo in theſe ſorts or ſpecies of Viviparous Animals, (and perhaps in all other whatſoever;) that the <hi>Embryo</hi> is in no other manner ſuſteined in the <hi>Vterus,</hi> then the <hi>chicken</hi> in the <hi>Egge;</hi> but out of the ſame Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritive ſubſtance, and of like kind to the <hi>Aliment</hi> in the <hi>White</hi> of an <hi>Egge.</hi> For as in an <hi>Egge,</hi> the extremities of the <hi>Vmbilical</hi> veſſels are terminated in the <hi>White</hi> and <hi>Yolk:</hi> ſo likewiſe in Hinds and Does, and other Animals, that are furniſhed with theſe Caruncles, the extremity of the Orifices of the <hi>Vmbilical</hi> veſſels are opened into, &amp; terminated in the humour which is conteined in the Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and in that white ſubſtance, which is found in thoſe Orifices or <hi>Cotyledones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this truth is hence alſo aſſerted, in that the extremities of the threads or filaments of the <hi>Vm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilical</hi> veſſels, when they are drawn out of that mucous or <hi>white ſubſtance,</hi> are all of them white likewiſe; which is a forcible argument they do onely imbibe this <hi>gelly</hi> or <hi>mucilage,</hi> and not <hi>blood.</hi> And any man may prove the ſame Experiment in an <hi>Egge</hi> alſo, if he deſire it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>After-burden,</hi> or <hi>Vterine cake</hi> of a Woman, is in its <hi>gibbous</hi> part, wherewith it reſpects the <hi>Womb,</hi> uneven, &amp; hilly, by reaſon of ſeveral tumors or muſhroom-like ſubſtances; and ſeems by their mediation to grow to the <hi>Womb.</hi> As if it were not faſtned to the womb in every part, but onely in thoſe places, where the veſſels diſſeminated into
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:56144:242"/>
it do extract <hi>Aliment,</hi> and in which for that cauſe, the <hi>extremities</hi> of the <hi>veſſels</hi> are broken off. Now whether thoſe <hi>extremities</hi> or <hi>terminations</hi> of the <hi>veſſels</hi> do ſuck blood from the <hi>Womb,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome kind of concocted ſubſtance like to the <hi>White</hi> of an <hi>Egge,</hi> ſuch as we perceive plainly in Hinds, and Does, I am not yet ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, (that the truth in hand may be certainly confirmed) if you ſqueeze thoſe <hi>caruncles</hi> between your fingers; you may eaſily <hi>Milk</hi> as much of that <hi>Nutritive juice</hi> as a ſpoon can contein, out of any one of thoſe <hi>Caruncles;</hi> (as out of a <hi>Nipple)</hi> without any appearance of <hi>blood</hi> at all; which blood you ſhall never ſqueez from them though you force them never ſo much. Moreover, the <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runcle</hi> thus milked &amp; drained, doth contract it ſelf, and flag, like to a <hi>ſponge</hi> that is ſqueezed, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be bored through with ſeveral <hi>perforati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> So that by all ſigns and tokens it appears that thoſe <hi>Caruncles</hi> are <hi>Ubera Vterina,</hi> the <hi>Breaſts</hi> or <hi>Vdders</hi> of the <hi>Uterus,</hi> or the receptacles and ſtore-houſes of that <hi>Nutritive white ſubſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the end of <hi>December,</hi> theſe <hi>Caruncles</hi> do leſs firmly cleave to the <hi>Vterus,</hi> then they did before, and are with caſe divided from it. And by how much the <hi>foetus</hi> doth improve, and grow neerer to the <hi>birth,</hi> ſo much the eaſier do thoſe <hi>caruncles</hi> disjoin from the <hi>Womb:</hi> and in the end (as ripe <hi>fruit</hi> falls off from the <hi>Tree)</hi> they depart from the <hi>Vterus</hi> of their own accord, as being things which relate to the <hi>conception.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when they are parted from the <hi>Womb,</hi> you may, in the impreſſions which they leave behind them, perceive the <hi>points</hi> or <hi>terminations</hi> of the <hi>Arteries</hi> which paſs on towards them, breathing forth blood. But if you force the <hi>conception</hi> from
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:56144:243"/>
the <hi>caruncles,</hi> no <hi>blood</hi> doth iſſue out from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions which they leave behind them: though it do ſeem more conſonant to reaſon, that <hi>blood</hi> ſhould iſſue out of the <hi>caruncles,</hi> then of the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception</hi> upon their divorce. For ſince the <hi>caruncles</hi> are embroidered by ſeveral <hi>propagations</hi> of <hi>Arteries</hi> derived from the <hi>Vterus;</hi> and are commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to convey <hi>blood</hi> for the <hi>nutriment</hi> of the <hi>Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> they ought in conſequence to abound with plenty of <hi>Blood.</hi> And yet though you milk or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them, they effund no <hi>blood</hi> at all; becauſe they are not ful of <hi>blood,</hi> but of this <hi>white ſubſtance;</hi> nor do they ſeem to be inſtruments inſtituted for the concoction of the former, but <hi>Promptuaries,</hi> or <hi>Treaſuries</hi> of the latter. By which it is apparent, that the <hi>foetus</hi> in the <hi>Womb,</hi> is not ſuſteined by the <hi>Mothers blood,</hi> but by this <hi>white ſubſtance</hi> fitly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. And perhaps even grown bodies are not nouriſhed by <hi>blood,</hi> but ſomething which runs in the <hi>blood,</hi> is their common and laſt <hi>Aliment:</hi> as ſhall perhaps be elſewhere diſcovered in our <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiological Treatiſe,</hi> and in the proper diſceptation relating to the blood.</p>
            <p>I do much queſtion the truth of that place of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> where he ſaith: <hi>Thoſe Animals whoſe</hi> 
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>Acetabula or Orifices of their Vterine veſſels are full of a mucous ſubſtance, do ſuffer Abortment.</hi> For that <hi>ſubſtance</hi> is not an <hi>Excrement,</hi> and cauſe of <hi>Aborti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> but an <hi>Aliment</hi> and firſt cauſe of <hi>life.</hi> But <hi>Hippocrates</hi> perhaps meant ſome other <hi>Acetabula:</hi> for in a Woman they are not found, nor hath her <hi>After-birth</hi> any ſuch ſubſtance as this to be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly perceived in any of its <hi>cavities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Later Phyſitians, according to the opinion of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> do phanſie three ſeveral Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Humours; namely, <hi>Rorem,</hi> the dewy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:56144:243"/>
               <hi>Gluten,</hi> the glutinous ſubſtance, and <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium,</hi> the ſubſtance which is immediately trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into the eſſence of the parts: and theſe <hi>Fernelius</hi> calls <hi>ſuccos Nutritios,</hi> the alible juices; as conceiving, that the Parts of our <hi>bodies</hi> are not immediatly nouriſhed by the <hi>Blood,</hi> as its laſt <hi>ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> but by theſe <hi>ſecundary humours:</hi> by the firſt whereof, as by a kind of Dew, all the ſmalleſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the <hi>body</hi> and parts thereof, are ſprinckled and bedewed; which <hi>humour</hi> being thickned by a farther <hi>concoction,</hi> and ſticking more firmly to the Parts, is now called <hi>Gluten,</hi> which at laſt being altered and aſſimilated by the power and virtue of the Parts, is called <hi>Cambium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may, according to theſe Mens conceit, call that ſubſtance which we finde in the <hi>Acetabula,</hi> or <hi>Orifices</hi> of the <hi>veſſels,</hi> the <hi>Gluten,</hi> or <hi>Nutritive white,</hi> and ſay that it is (as being the laſt Aliment which is deſigned to all the ſeveral parts of the <hi>foetus)</hi> proportionable to the <hi>White</hi> or <hi>Yolk</hi> of the <hi>Egge.</hi> For as we ſaid ere-while, with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that the <hi>Yolk</hi> is proportionable to <hi>milk:</hi> ſo we likewiſe conceive it conſonant to reaſon, to affirm, that this ſubſtance, which is contained in the <hi>Cotyledo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> or <hi>Acetabula</hi> of the <hi>Uterine cake,</hi> doth ſupply the office of <hi>milk</hi> to the <hi>foetus,</hi> ſo long as it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues in the <hi>womb:</hi> and conſequently, that the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runcles</hi> are as it were <hi>Ubera interna,</hi> internal Dugs, and that the <hi>alible juice</hi> is (after the delivery) tranſported into the <hi>Breaſts,</hi> and there made <hi>milk;</hi> that ſo the <hi>foetus</hi> may enjoy the ſame nutriment after he is born, wherewith he was fed when he continued in the <hi>womb.</hi> And therefore this onely difference is between the party-coloured Eggs of <hi>Oviparous Animals</hi> (which are compounded of the <hi>Yolk</hi> and <hi>White)</hi> and the Eggs or Conceptions of
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:56144:244"/>
               <hi>Viviparous Animals,</hi> that in the former, the <hi>Yolk</hi> (which is their <hi>ſecundary ſuſtenance)</hi> is provided for them within the Egg, and preſently upon their Excluſion, is ſhut up within the belly of the <hi>Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi> as being reſerved there for their ſupport; but in the latter, this <hi>nutritive ſubſtance</hi> is before the Birth preſerved in the <hi>Acetabula,</hi> and after the Birth tranſmitted to the <hi>Breaſts</hi> or Udder. So that the <hi>Pullus</hi> is ſupplied with a kinde of <hi>milke,</hi> which is concluded in it ſelf; but the <hi>Viviparous foetus,</hi> ſucks the ſame from the duggs of the Dam.</p>
            <p>When <hi>December</hi> is ended, ſeeing that in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent moneths of <hi>January, February,</hi> &amp;c. there is nothing new or notable doth befall the <hi>foetus,</hi> but all its acceſſions have been obſerved already, (ſave onely the <hi>Hair, Teeth, Horns,</hi> and the like) only the parts formerly deſcribed ſeem to have attained a larger Augmentation, litle or nothing reſpecting the buſineſs of Generation, we conceive it uſeleſs to diſcourſe any more of them at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>But as to the Conceptions of <hi>Ewes,</hi> I have diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted divers of them about this time, which (like thoſe of <hi>Does)</hi> did alſo reſemble the figure of a <hi>Wallet,</hi> or <hi>double-pudding,</hi> being extended over both the Horns of the <hi>Womb.</hi> In ſome of theſe Conceptions I found two <hi>foetus;</hi> in other, <hi>one</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that void of all kinde of <hi>wool,</hi> with its <hi>eyes</hi> ſo congealed and fixed together, that I could not open the <hi>lids,</hi> and yet the <hi>hoofs</hi> were already made. Where there were two <hi>foetus,</hi> they lay in ſeveral Horns of the <hi>Uterus,</hi> and that promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, without any order at all obſerved, the <hi>male</hi> being ſometimes in the <hi>left,</hi> and the <hi>female</hi> in the <hi>right Horn,</hi> and ſometimes clean contrary: but both were ſtill encompaſſed in the ſame common
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:56144:244"/>
               <hi>Conception,</hi> and concluded in the ſame <hi>exteriour membrane</hi> called <hi>Chorion;</hi> whoſe Extremities or ends on both Sides towards the termination of the Horns, were ſtained as it were by a kinde of <hi>cholerical excrement,</hi> and did ſeem to have ſome turbid and excrementitious matter within them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Caruncles,</hi> or litle <hi>Cakes,</hi> were diverſe, and of a different <hi>magnitude,</hi> and of a diſtinct <hi>figure</hi> from the <hi>caruncles</hi> of <hi>Hinds</hi> and <hi>Does:</hi> for in <hi>Ewes,</hi> there is a kind of round <hi>muſhroom</hi> with the ſtalk broken off, contained between the Coats of the <hi>Uterus,</hi> whoſe gibbous Part lieth towards the <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus;</hi> (as it is alſo in the Conceptions of <hi>Cowes)</hi> but the <hi>concave</hi> (which is ſmooth) towards the <hi>foetus:</hi> and likewiſe larger Branches or Veſſels are derived to this <hi>concave part,</hi> as it alſo happens to the <hi>interiour part</hi> of a Womans <hi>After-burden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Propagations of the <hi>Umbilical Veſſels</hi> being annexed to the <hi>caruncles,</hi> do grow ſo firmly to them, that when I endeavoured to divide them, the <hi>gibbous part</hi> would be ſooner broken off from the <hi>interiour coat</hi> of the <hi>Womb,</hi> then recede from the Conception: contrary to their cuſtom in <hi>Hinds</hi> and <hi>Does,</hi> whoſe <hi>membrane</hi> called <hi>Chorion,</hi> is eaſily ſeparated from the <hi>Cotylidones</hi> of the <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runcles;</hi> and the <hi>convexe ſide</hi> of the <hi>caruncles,</hi> which adhereth to the Conception, may be divided from it; but the Concave part, or root rather, or ſtalk, ſticketh faſt to the <hi>Uterus.</hi> But in other matters, the office is alike in all, and they have the like <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetabula,</hi> and an <hi>Albugineous gelly</hi> may in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be milked out of them, as out of theſe <hi>carun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> of <hi>Cowes</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>Where there is but one ſingle <hi>foetus</hi> in a Conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, there that <hi>foetus</hi> doth tranſmit his <hi>Umbili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Veſſels</hi> to all the <hi>caruncles</hi> of both the Horns of
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:56144:245"/>
the <hi>womb,</hi> that ſo he may derive nutriment from both. But that Horn wherein the <hi>foetus</hi> himſelf (ſwimming in the <hi>cryſtal water</hi> which lies within the <hi>coat</hi> called <hi>Amnion)</hi> doth reſide, is larger then the other. But where there are two <hi>foetus</hi> in one and the ſame Conception, there each of them are confined to their proper <hi>caruncles,</hi> and do tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their <hi>Umbilical Veſſels</hi> into their own proper Horn only, and receive their Nutriment from thence.</p>
            <p>If it be a <hi>Male foetus,</hi> the Teſticles are large (for it's time) hanging without in the <hi>Scrotum.</hi> If an <hi>Ewe-lamb,</hi> the Udder hanging in the ſame place, hath litle Tets or Nipples, as Womens <hi>Breaſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the twofold <hi>ſtomack</hi> of the <hi>foetus</hi> (namely, the <hi>Maw</hi> and the <hi>Dew-lap)</hi> there appeared a <hi>cryſtal water</hi> like to that where he ſwam; for they did agree both in <hi>colour, ſent, taſte,</hi> and <hi>conſiſtence:</hi> there was alſo in the <hi>upper Guts</hi> a ſubſtance like to <hi>chyle;</hi> in the <hi>lower,</hi> a green excrement, and dry dung, ſuch as they uſe to eject when they graze: the <hi>Liver</hi> was ſomething large, and the <hi>Bladder</hi> of <hi>Gall</hi> of an <hi>oblong figure,</hi> and in ſome of them it was quite empty.</p>
            <p>But as to the order of the <hi>production</hi> of the <hi>Parts,</hi> we have ſtill found the ſame to be obſerved in all <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viparous Embryo's</hi> whatſoever, as Experience hath revealed to us in that of the <hi>Egge,</hi> the <hi>Hinde,</hi> and the <hi>Doe.</hi>

The truth is, there is no need at all to enquire after any kinde of <hi>ſpirit</hi> diſtinct from the <hi>Blood</hi> it ſelf, or to introduce any forraign heat, or invoke the <hi>Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> to appear in the fable, and ſo trim up <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie</hi> with vain opinions and fictions; for what we commonly derive from the <hi>Starres,</hi> is bred and born at home, and within us. For the <hi>Blood</hi> alone is the true <hi>Galidum Innatum,</hi> or firſt-born <hi>Animal heat:</hi> as it is made apparent by our obſervations concerning the <hi>Generation</hi> of <hi>Animals;</hi> (eſpecially of the <hi>Chicken</hi> out of the <hi>Egge)</hi> and therefore to multiply Entities, is meerly frivolous. For, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, there is nothing either before, or more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in the <hi>Animal body,</hi> then <hi>Blood;</hi> nor are thoſe <hi>ſpirits</hi> which ſome men diſtinguiſh from <hi>Blood,</hi> any where to be found a part from the <hi>blood;</hi> and the <hi>Blood</hi> it ſelf, without <hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>heat,</hi> is no longer to be called <hi>Blood,</hi> but <hi>Gore.</hi> The <hi>Blood,</hi>

               <hi>yet being conſidered as the ſubject of Heat, and ſuch a ſubſtance, as when it is in being, is Blood, ſo it is not hot: for it is in ſome reſpect hot</hi> per ſe, <hi>or eſſentially, &amp; in ſome reſpect it is not hot</hi> per ſe; <hi>for Heat is of its eſſence, as Whiteneſs is of the eſſence of a white man: but for aſmuch as it is blood, in relation to Action or Paſſion, ſo it is not</hi> calidus per ſe, <hi>or eſſentially hot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We Phyſitians call that <hi>Spiritus,</hi> a Spirit, which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> called <hi>Impetum faciens,</hi> that is, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever doth attempt any thing <hi>proprio conamine,</hi> by its own proper endeavour, and doth ſet upon any action, or excite any motion with agility and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence: and under that capacity, the <hi>ſpirits</hi> of <hi>Wine,</hi> or of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> are called <hi>ſpirits.</hi> And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Phyſitians</hi> count as many <hi>ſpirits,</hi> as <hi>principal parts,</hi> or <hi>operations;</hi> namely, <hi>Animal, Vital, Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, Viſory, Auditory, Concoctive, Generative, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted, Influent Spirits, &amp;c.</hi> But the <hi>Blood</hi> (the <hi>primogenit</hi> and <hi>principal part of the Body)</hi> is furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all theſe reſpective qualities, and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with active power beyond all other parts of the <hi>body,</hi> and doth therefore deſerve the name of a <hi>ſpirit</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Scaliger, Fernelius,</hi> &amp; others, having not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered the excellent endowments implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Blood,</hi> have phanſied other <hi>Aerial</hi> or <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therial ſpirits,</hi> compoſed of an <hi>Aetherial</hi> and <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary ſubſtance,</hi> to be a more excellent and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viner <hi>Innate heat</hi> then <hi>blood;</hi> which they conceited to be the moſt immediate <hi>inſtrument</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> moſt proportionable to all its <hi>operations:</hi> ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their opinion upon this opinion; namely, that the <hi>Blood</hi> (as being a ſubſtance compounded out of the <hi>Elements</hi> only) cannot perform any action be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ſphere or activity of the <hi>Elements,</hi> and ſuch bodies as are framed out of them. Hereupon
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:56144:246"/>
they feigned a diſtinct <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and <hi>innate heat,</hi> which is of a <hi>celeſtial extract;</hi> namely, a moſt ſimple, moſt ſubtle, moſt thin, ſwift, lucid, and aetherial ſubſtance, partaking of a fift eſſence. But yet they have no where demonſtrated that there is any ſuch ſubſtance, or that it doth act beyond the power of the Elements, or execute greater things then the <hi>Blood</hi> alone is able to accompliſh. But we, who examine the nature of things according to <hi>ſenſe,</hi> have never diſcovered any ſuch <hi>ſubſtance.</hi> Nor are there in the Body any receptacles deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the conſervation, or generation of ſuch matters, and they themſelves alſo have not aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any. <hi>Feruelius,</hi> indeed, ſaith, That <hi>whoſoever hath not yet attained to the knowledge of the ſubſtance and condition of the Innate Heat, muſt firſt conſider the ſtructure of our bodies, and then addreſs himſelf to the arteries which are ſeated in the cavity of the Heart, and to the Ventricles of the Braine; which when he ſhall diſcover void and empty, and without any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour contained therein, yet can be not imagine that ſuch worthy matters are made by Nature raſhly, and to no uſe: and upon this conſideration, I conceive, he will preſently conclude, that while the Animal was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, they were repleniſhed by ſome thin Aerial ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which when the animal Soul departed, being exceeding light, did inſenſibly vaniſh. Now, to ſupport this ſubſtance, the faculty of Inſpiration is beſtowed upon us, which doth not onely coole the body (for that might be derived to us by other meanes) but alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter a kinde of nouriſhment.</hi> But we affirm, that (ſo long as the <hi>Animal</hi> is alive) the <hi>Arteries &amp; Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles</hi> of the <hi>Heart,</hi> are filled with <hi>blood;</hi> reputing the <hi>Ventricles</hi> of the <hi>Brain,</hi> to be too mean <hi>inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> for ſo noble a work, conceiving them rather allotted to the <hi>reception</hi> of <hi>excrements.</hi> For, what
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:56144:247"/>
ſhall we ſay of thoſe ſeveral Animals, whoſe Brain hath no <hi>Ventricles</hi> at all? And though we ſhould admit, that a kinde of <hi>Aire</hi> or <hi>vapour</hi> may be there found (becauſe <hi>Nature</hi> doth decline a <hi>vacuity)</hi> yet that that ſubſtance is of a celeſtial extract, and heir apparent to ſuch excellent performances, hath no ſemblance of truth at all. But that which we moſt admire, is, How this ſo exquiſite, ſo divine a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> ſhould be ſuſtained and fed by our common <hi>elementary aire?</hi> eſpecially, ſince themſelves aſſure us, that none of the <hi>Elements</hi> can perform any thing beyond their own abilities.</p>
            <p>Theſe men do likewiſe confeſs, that the ſpirit is in continual declenſion, and quickly diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and corrupted, and that it could not ſubſiſt one moment of time, were it not repaired by the plentiful acceſſion of outward aliment; and that therefore like the <hi>Primum Vivens,</hi> the firſt particle inſpired with life, it muſt continually be fed. And now what need of this forraign gueſt, this <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Spirit,</hi> or etherial heat? Since the <hi>blood</hi> is of ability to execute whatſoever is attributed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; and ſince theſe ſpirits cannot recede from the <hi>blood,</hi> (without their diſſolution) Nay they do not move any whither, or inſinuate themſelves into any part (as diſtinct bodies) without the company of the <hi>blood.</hi> For whether you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them to be framed, nouriſhed, and increaſed out of the thinner part of the <hi>blood,</hi> (as ſome ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine) or out of the <hi>primigenial moiſture</hi> (as others) yet all confeſs that they are no where to be found out of the <hi>blood,</hi> but that they continually cleave to the <hi>blood,</hi> as to their ſupport (as the <hi>flame</hi> clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to the <hi>oyle</hi> in the <hi>lamp.)</hi> And therefore their <hi>tenuity, ſubtlety,</hi> and <hi>mobility,</hi> &amp;c. are of no more uſe then the <hi>blood,</hi> whoſe inſeparable companions
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:56144:247"/>
they are. So that the <hi>blood</hi> is ſufficient, to become the proportionate and immediate inſtrument of the <hi>Soul;</hi> becauſe it is every where preſent, and doth fly to and fro with an admirable agility. Nor are there any other bodies, or <hi>ſpirital incorpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al qualities,</hi> or any <hi>diviner heat</hi> to be allowed of, (as <hi>lux &amp; lumen,</hi> the Light, and Shine) as <hi>Caeſar</hi>

            </p>
            <p>If theſe men pretend, that theſe <hi>ſpirits</hi> do reſide in the <hi>primigenial moiſture,</hi> as in the laſt <hi>Aliment,</hi> and from thence inſinuate themſelfs into the whole body, thereby to nouriſh all the <hi>parts;</hi> they then conclude upon an impoſſibility, namely that the <hi>Calidum Innatum</hi> the Innate Heat, which is the <hi>primigenial part</hi> of the body (and ſtands it ſelf in need of ſuſtenance) doth nouriſh the <hi>whole body.</hi> For upon this account, the ſame thing is both the thing that is nouriſhed, &amp; alſo the thing by which it is nouriſhed; and the ſelf ſame ſubſtance, under the ſame reſpect, ſhould both feed it ſelf, and be fed alſo, which is indeed impoſſible: for in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability the thing which doth feed, and the thing which is fed, are not ſo much as mixed together: for miſcible things muſt be of equal power, and operate one upon the other. And <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, <hi>Ubi nutritio, ibi nulla miſtio eſt,</hi> Where there is <hi>Nutrition,</hi> there is no <hi>Miſtion.</hi> For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever <hi>Nutrition</hi> is, there the <hi>Aliment</hi> is one thing, and the thing nouriſhed another; and a neceſſity of the tranſmutation of the one into the other.</p>
            <p>But whereas they conceive that the <hi>Spirits,</hi> and the <hi>laſt</hi> or <hi>primigenial Aliment,</hi> or ſome other thing what ever it be in an <hi>Animal,</hi> can (more then the <hi>blood)</hi> operate above the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Elements;</hi> they ſeem not to underſtand what it is to operate
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:56144:248"/>
above the power of the <hi>Elements:</hi> nor do they rightly interpret that place of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> where he <note place="margin">

But the heat of the Sun, and of Animals, not that onely which is conteined in the ſeed, but alſo whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver excrement there be, though of a different nature yet even that alſo hath a vital principle. Wherefor it appeareth by what hath been ſaid, that the hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> conteined in Animals, neither is it ſelf fire, nor doth take its original from fire.</hi> For I alſo do affirm the ſame of the <hi>Innate Heat,</hi> and of <hi>Blood,</hi> namely that they are not <hi>Fire,</hi> neither do they take their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal from fire, but do partake of a different, and more divine ſubſtance then fire is, and therefore do not act by any <hi>elementary faculty;</hi> but as in the <hi>ſeed</hi> there is ſomething which doth make it <hi>fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> and exceeds the vertues or powers of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in conſtituting an <hi>Animal body;</hi> namely the <hi>ſpirit</hi> and the <hi>nature</hi> which is in that <hi>ſpirit,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable in proportion to the <hi>element</hi> or <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the <hi>Stars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So likewiſe in the <hi>Blood,</hi> there is a <hi>ſpirit</hi> or <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> which doth act above the power of <hi>Elements</hi> (moſt conſpicuous in the <hi>nutrition</hi> or <hi>preſervation</hi> of each particular part) and alſo a <hi>nature,</hi> nay a <hi>ſoul</hi> in that <hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> anſwerable in proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

to the <hi>Element</hi> of the <hi>Stars.</hi> And laſtly, it is moſt evident, and my obſervations do plainly ſhew it, that there is a Heat in the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Animals</hi> (whileſt life continueth) which is neither fire, nor doth derive its original from fire.</p>
            <p>But for the clearer illuſtration of theſe matters, give us leave to digreſs a while from our purpoſe, and declare briefly, <hi>what a ſpirit is, and what it is to act above the power of Elements,</hi> and likewiſe what is meant by theſe words, namely, <hi>to partake of a different body, and that more divine, then thoſe bodies which are called Elements:</hi> as likewiſe what is <hi>that nature in that ſpirit which is anſwerable in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the element or ſubſtance of the Stars.</hi> What <hi>A Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Vital principle</hi> is, we have partly ſpoken already, and ſhall now handle ſomething more largely. There are three ſeveral (ſimple) bodies, which do chiefly ſeem to challenge the name, or function at leaſt of a <hi>ſpirit;</hi> namely, the <hi>Fire,</hi> the <hi>Aire,</hi> and the <hi>Water;</hi> and every one of theſe doth ſeem to partake of a <hi>life,</hi> or other <hi>body,</hi> by reaſon of their perpetual motion and flux; (I mean) the <hi>Flame,</hi> the <hi>Wind,</hi> and the <hi>Floud.</hi> The <hi>Flame</hi> is the <hi>Flux,</hi> or <hi>Stream</hi> of <hi>Fire,</hi> the <hi>Wind</hi> of <hi>Aire,</hi> and the <hi>Flood</hi> of <hi>Water. Flame</hi> like an <hi>Animal,</hi> doth move it ſelf, nouriſh, and increaſe it ſelf, and is an Embleme of <hi>humane life.</hi> And therefore it is much uſed in <hi>divine Ceremonies:</hi> and was reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly kept (as a ſacred thing) in the Temples dedicated to <hi>Apollo,</hi> and <hi>Veſta,</hi> by <hi>Virgins;</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and diverſe other <hi>Nations,</hi> it was from all <hi>Antiquity</hi> honoured with <hi>divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi> As if <hi>God</hi> were more viſible in <hi>Fire,</hi> and did converſe with us, (as heretofore with <hi>Moſes)</hi> out of the <hi>Fire.</hi> The <hi>Air</hi> alſo ſeems to merit the name of a <hi>ſpirit</hi> too, for a <hi>ſpirit</hi> is called <hi>ſpiritus a</hi>
               <pb n="454" facs="tcp:56144:249"/>
               <hi>ſpirando,</hi> from breathing; and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> confeſſeth in plain tearms, <hi>that there is a kind of life and death of Winds.</hi> And laſtly, the Water of the <hi>Flood</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>De gen. an. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c. ult.</hi>
               </note> or <hi>River,</hi> is called <hi>Viva,</hi> living Water. Thoſe three bodies therefore (in as much as they enjoy a kind of life) do ſeem to operate above the power of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements,</hi> and ſo partake of a <hi>diviner body</hi> or <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> and hereupon were by the <hi>Heathen</hi> ranked amongſt the <hi>gods,</hi> who conceived that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did perform any eminent effects, which did ſurpoſe the naked abilities of the <hi>Elements,</hi> thoſe effects did proceed from ſome <hi>diviner Agent.</hi> As if it were the ſame thing, to act above the power of the <hi>Elements,</hi> and to partake of a more divine eſſence, which did not deduce it ſelfe from the <hi>Elements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus in like manner the <hi>Blood</hi> doth act above the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Elements,</hi> when now being the <hi>Primogenite part,</hi> and <hi>Innate Heat</hi> (as it is in the <hi>Seed,</hi> and in the <hi>Spirit)</hi> it doth conſtitute the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>parts</hi> in <hi>order;</hi> and this with an <hi>eminent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> and <hi>underſtanding,</hi> acting in order to a certain end, as if it did exerciſe a kind of <hi>Ratioci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> or <hi>diſcourſe.</hi> For it doth not theſe offices as as it is <hi>Elementary,</hi> and deriveth its original from <hi>Fire,</hi> but in as much as it is made the <hi>Primigenial Heat,</hi> and moſt immediate and convenient inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life it ſelf, by being impowred by the <hi>Plaſtical virtue,</hi> and <hi>function</hi> of the <hi>Vegetative ſoul</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And ſo in this manner, all <hi>natural bodies</hi> fall under a double conſideration; namely, as they are conſidered, in their private capacity, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded within the <hi>bounds</hi> of their own proper nature; or elſe, as they are the <hi>Inſtruments</hi> of a <hi>nobler Agent,</hi> and <hi>ſuperiour power.</hi> For being conſidered in their own proper abilities, it is perhaps no queſtion, but that being all ſubject to <hi>generation</hi> and <hi>corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> they do derive their original from the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and act according to their <hi>rule:</hi> but being conſidered as they are the <hi>Inſtruments</hi> of a <hi>more worthy Agent,</hi> and regulated thereby, they do not now act of themſelves, but by the guidance of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; and thereupon ſeem to participate of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>more divine Eſſence,</hi> and ſo exceed the <hi>power of the Elements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So likewiſe the heat of the <hi>blood</hi> is an <hi>animal heat,</hi> inaſmuch as it is guided in its <hi>operations</hi> by the <hi>ſoul;</hi> and alſo a <hi>Celeſtial heat,</hi> as being <hi>ſubſervient</hi> to the <hi>Heavens;</hi> and laſtly, a <hi>Divine heat,</hi> in that it is the <hi>Inſtrument</hi> of <hi>Almighty God:</hi> as we have formerly ſaid, where we alſo did demonſtrate, that the <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female,</hi> are the <hi>Inſtruments</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> the <hi>Heavens,</hi> and of <hi>God</hi> himſelf, as being <hi>ſubſervient</hi> to the <hi>generation</hi> of <hi>Animals.</hi>

The <hi>Inferiour World,</hi> according to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> is ſo continuous to the <hi>Superiour Orbes,</hi> that all its motions and mutations do ſeem to borrow their original, and regulation from them. And truly in this World (which the Greeks call <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>That it may therefore more clearly appear, that thoſe eminent attributes which learned men beſtow upon the <hi>Spirits,</hi> and the <hi>Innate Heat,</hi> do belong to the <hi>blood</hi> alone; Theſe few following conſiderations do offer themſelves, over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thoſe things, which are wonderfully evident in an <hi>Egge</hi> (before any rudiment of the <hi>Chicken</hi> appear) and alſo in a perfect and adult <hi>Foetus.</hi> Namely, that the <hi>blood</hi> being conſidered abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in it ſelf out of the Veins, as it is an elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubſtance, and compoſed of ſeveral parts (nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of ſerous, thin, craſs, and concrete parts) is called <hi>Cruor, Gore,</hi> and doth poſſeſs a few onely, and thoſe obſcure abilities.

doth alſo challenge the name of <hi>Spirit,</hi> in as much as it doth primarily, and before the other parts, abound with <hi>Radical moiſture,</hi> which is the laſt and neereſt aliment thereof, and doth diſpence and provide the ſame ſuſtenance for all the reſt of the parts; wherewith it ſelf is ſupported: namely while it doth nimbly dart it ſelf through the <hi>whole body,</hi> and nouriſh, cheriſh, and keep alive all the parts thereof, (which it ſelf doth firſt frame, and adjoin to it ſelfe) after the ſame manner as the ſuperiour Orbes (but eſpecially the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon)</hi> do, by their <hi>continual motions,</hi> quicken and preſerve the <hi>inferiour world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing therefore that the <hi>Blood</hi> doth act above the power of the <hi>Elements,</hi> and is inſpired with ſuch notable virtues, being alſo the <hi>Inſtrument</hi> of the <hi>Omnipotent Agent;</hi> no man can worthily mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie and extol its wonderful and divine faculties.

For ſuch is the <hi>ſoul,</hi> that it is not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a <hi>body,</hi> nor yet wholly without a <hi>body;</hi> it comes partly from without, and is partly born at home: in ſome ſort it is a <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>body,</hi> and in ſome the beginning and cauſe of <hi>all things</hi> which are contained in the <hi>Animal body;</hi> namely, <hi>nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſenſe,</hi> and <hi>motion;</hi> and ſo conſequently of <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> alſo: for whatſoever is nouriſhed, doth alſo <hi>live;</hi> and ſo on the contrary. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe whatſoever is plentifully nouriſhed, is alſo inlarged; but that which is too ſparingly nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:56144:252"/>
doth diminiſh: that alſo which is perfectly nouriſhed, doth continue in health, but that which is not, doth incline to diſeaſes. The <hi>blood</hi> therefore, as well as the <hi>ſoul,</hi> is to be reputed the cauſe and author, both of Youth, and Old Age, of Sleep and Waking, and of Breathing alſo: eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſince in Natural productions the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument doth contein in it ſelf the internal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cauſe. And therefore it comes all to the ſame reckoning, whether we ſay, that the <hi>ſoul</hi> and the <hi>blood,</hi> or the <hi>blood</hi> with the <hi>ſoul,</hi> or the <hi>ſoul</hi> with the <hi>blood,</hi> doth performe all the effects in an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We uſe, as perſons that neglect the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to pay much reverence to the ſpecious names. The <hi>blood</hi> which is ſtill at hand, and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our view, makes no great noiſe in our ears; but at the magnificent name of <hi>Spirits,</hi> and of an <hi>Innate Heat,</hi> we are ſtrangely amuſed. But when once the vizour is plucked from before them, as our errour, ſo our wonder ceaſeth. That mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Stone, rendered ſo venerable to <hi>Mizaldus</hi> by the commendation of <hi>Pipinus,</hi> did not onely fill him with admiration, but <hi>Thuanus</hi> alſo: (who was an eminent <hi>Hiſtoriographer</hi> in his time) I ſhall here adjoin the Riddle it ſelf. <hi>I ſaw,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a Stone which was lately brought hither to our King out of the</hi> Eaſt Indies, <hi>which Stone did dart forth light, and brightneſs, after a wonderful manner, ſparkling and ſhining with ſo much incredible luſtre, as if it were all burning, and in a flame. This ſtone doth by his rayes ſcattered into every corner, illuſtrate the ambient aire with ſo clear a ſhine, that the firmeſt ſight is ſcarce able to behold it. It is alſo moſt impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of earth: for if you attempt to cover it, it doth of its own accord, with an impetuous violence fly upward.</hi>
               <pb n="461" facs="tcp:56144:252"/>
               <hi>All the Art of man cannot confine and ſhut it up into a narrow room, for it ſeemeth to be affected with free &amp; open places onely. The infinite purity, and brightneſs thereof, is not tainted by the leaſt ſpot, or blemiſh. It hath no certain ſhape or figure, but varieth, and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in an inſtant. And though it be moſt faire and beautiful to the Eye: yet will it not endure to be touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and if you attempt too long to handle it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue too obſtinate in your reſolution, it will miſchiefe you: as many in my preſence have deerly found. And if any thing be by violence taken from it, it remaines for all that (which is very wonderful) nothing leſs then it was before. The ſtranger who brought it, addes far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to all this, that its virtue and power is exceeding uſeful to ſundry emploiments, but will not diſcover them without a great reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This travailer alſo might have added to his deſcription, that this Stone is neither ſoft nor hard; that it puts on ſeveral ſhapes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions, that it hath a continual trembling and palpitation, and doth like an <hi>Animal</hi> (though it be an <hi>Inanimate</hi> thing) daily devour great ſtore of food, converting it to its own nutriment and augmentation: and that he hath been told by men of good credit, that this <hi>Stone</hi> did long ago fall down from heaven, and is to this day the cauſe of <hi>Thunders</hi> and <hi>Lightnings;</hi> being ſome times begotten by the <hi>refraction</hi> of the <hi>Sun-beams</hi> through the <hi>Waters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who can but admire ſo ſtrange a <hi>Stone,</hi> and conceive leſs of it, then to be above the power of the <hi>Elements,</hi> and ſo to partake of another body, and of an etherial ſpirit, eſpecially when he finds that it is anſwerable in proportion to the <hi>Element</hi> or <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the <hi>ſun</hi> himſelf. And yet if <hi>Ferne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Phyſitians alſo (who conclude that all the <hi>parts</hi> at the beginning are made out of <hi>ſeed,</hi> or <hi>ſperme,</hi> (and upon that ground call them <hi>ſperma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical parts)</hi> do affirm that the <hi>ſeed</hi> is by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the <hi>Genital parts</hi> made out of the <hi>laſt aliment</hi> (which they with <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> conceive to be <hi>blood)</hi> and ſo doth conſtitute the <hi>matter</hi> of the <hi>Foetus.</hi> It is indeed a plain caſe, that the <hi>egge</hi> is produced by the <hi>Hen,</hi> and from her <hi>laſt aliment</hi> (namely her <hi>Ros nutritius,</hi> her nutritive juice.) The <hi>White</hi> therefore of an <hi>Egge,</hi> or that <hi>primogenit,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>antegenit colliquamentum,</hi> or melted ſubſtance, is to be reputed the <hi>truer ſeed</hi> of the <hi>Hen</hi> (though it be not ejected in <hi>coition,</hi> but provided ready before <hi>coition,</hi> or elſe collected after it; (as ſhall be perhaps more largely declared, to be incident to ſeveral <hi>Animals)</hi> which the <hi>geniture</hi> of the <hi>Male,</hi> doth according to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> coagulate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="467" facs="tcp:56144:255"/>
Since therefore I plainly ſee, that all the <hi>parts</hi> are faſhioned and fed by this one <hi>moiſture</hi> onely, (as the <hi>matter</hi> and firſt <hi>root</hi> of all) and ſince the fore-cited argument doth neceſſarily conclude as much; I can ſcarce refrain my pen from rebuking thoſe that follow <hi>Empedocles</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: (who will needs have all ſimilar bodies to be generated by the <hi>congregation</hi> of the four con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <hi>Elements:</hi> (as being mixt bodies) and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved or corrupted by their <hi>ſegregation)</hi> nor is <hi>Democritus</hi> and the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> who follow him, leſs blameable, who conſtitute all things out of the confluence of <hi>Atomes</hi> of <hi>different Figures.</hi> For it was their errour of old, and is a popular er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour at this day, that all <hi>ſimilar bodies</hi> are framed out of <hi>heterogeneous</hi> or <hi>different bodies.</hi> For according to this opinion, had a man <hi>Lincous</hi> his eyes he could not diſcerne any thing that were <hi>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar,</hi> one in number, identity, and continuity: but there were nothing but an appearing union, and an aſſembly or heap made up of a congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and certaine colligation of indiviſible bodies: ſo that <hi>generation</hi> were nothing elſe but an <hi>aggregation,</hi> and convenient poſiture of ſeveral parts.</p>
            <p>But for my part, neither in the production of <hi>Animals,</hi> nor in the <hi>generation</hi> of any <hi>ſimilar body</hi> whatſoever, (whether it were of the parts of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals, Plants, Stones,</hi> or <hi>Minerals, &amp;c.)</hi> I could never diſcover any ſuch <hi>congregation,</hi> or any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral praeexiſtent miſcible <hi>bodies,</hi> which were to be united afterwards in the work of <hi>Generation.</hi> Nor (ſo far as I could ever yet perceive, or by any meanes obſerve) are there any <hi>ſimilar parts</hi> which are firſt conſtituted in their ſeveral order, or exiſtence at the ſame time together (as <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And this do I believe to be obſerved in every Generation; ſo that the Similary mixt bodies have not their <hi>Elements</hi> exiſtent in time before them, but are rather themſelves in being before their <hi>Elements,</hi> (whether you underſtand by <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> the <hi>Fire,</hi> the <hi>Aire,</hi> the <hi>Earth,</hi> and the <hi>Water,</hi> with <hi>Empedocles,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> or the <hi>Salt,</hi> the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi> and the <hi>Mercury,</hi> with the <hi>Chymiſts;</hi> or the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes</hi> with <hi>Democritus)</hi> as being in <hi>Nature</hi> more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect then they.

            <p>Indeed <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> where he goes about to prove, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>L.</hi> 3. <hi>de coelo. c.</hi> 31.</note> that there are ſuch things as Elements, ſeems to waver in his judgement, whether he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve that they were <hi>actually</hi> in being, or onely <hi>in potentiâ:</hi> and doth conceive that in natural things they are <hi>in potentiâ</hi> rather then <hi>actu:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he affirms that there are ſuch things as Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, out of the <hi>diviſion, ſegregation,</hi> and <hi>ſolution</hi> of things. And yet that is but an infirme argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, namely, that natural bodies are genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or compounded firſt out of thoſe things, into which they are at laſt diſſolved and corrupted: for by that argument, ſomethings ſhould be compounded of Glaſſe, of Aſhes, and of Smoak; (becauſe we ſee them reduced at laſt into ſuch bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies) and ſince <hi>Artificial Diſtillation</hi> doth clearly demonſtrate, that ſo many ſeveral Vapours or Waters, and thoſe all of them of different Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, are extracted out of ſo many ſeveral bodies; the number of the elements ought to multiply <hi>in infinitum.</hi> Nor doth any <hi>Philoſopher</hi> ſay, that the <hi>Bodies</hi> which are diſſolved by <hi>Art,</hi> and are called <hi>Sincere Bodies,</hi> and <hi>indiviſible in ſpecies,</hi> are more <hi>ſingle elements,</hi> then the <hi>Aire, Water,</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> which we perceive by <hi>Senſe,</hi> and are obvious to our eyes.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, we do not ſee that any thing is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally produced out of <hi>fire,</hi> as a <hi>miſcible ſubſtance;</hi>
               <pb n="470" facs="tcp:56144:257"/>
and perhaps it is altogether impoſſible there ſhould; ſince <hi>fire</hi> (like a kind of living body) is in contiual flux, and ſeeketh ſuſtenance whereby it may be nouriſhed, and conſerved: according to that of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that <hi>fire</hi> onely is nouriſhed, and that chiefly becauſe of its form. But whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <note place="margin">

Whereupon it followeth, that it is impoſſible for <hi>Fire</hi> to be miſcible. For <hi>Miſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> according to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> is <hi>miſcibilium alterato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum unio,</hi> the union of miſcible things altered; where one miſcible thing is not transformed into another, but both of them being both <hi>active</hi> and <hi>paſſive</hi> in regard of themſelves, do conſtitute a third thing: but generation (eſpecially that which is by a <hi>Metamorphoſis)</hi> is the diſtribution of one ſimilar thing which is to be altered into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe more. Nor are mixt ſimilar bodies ſaid to be generated out of the <hi>Elements,</hi> but in ſome ſort to be conſtituted out of them: into which alſo they are capable to be diſſolved.</p>
            <p>But theſe matters do properly relate to that part of <hi>Phyſiology,</hi> which treateth of the <hi>Elements,</hi> and the <hi>Temperaments:</hi> where alſo we ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe more copiouſly of them.</p>

            <p>Thoſe things which are incident a litle before the <hi>Birth,</hi> and eſpecially to <hi>Women,</hi> preſaging the approaching delivery, are in part the preparation and diſpoſition of the <hi>Childing Woman,</hi> whereby ſhe may bring forth: and in part the ſcite, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per poſition of the Infant in order to the Birth.</p>
            <p>As concerning the <hi>Poſition,</hi> Fabricius ſaith, <hi>that it is of a conglobated and inflex figure, left the</hi> Foetus <hi>by his extream and eminent parts, might injure the</hi>

For he ſwimmeth in a water, and moveth himſelf to and fro, he ſtretcheth himſelf, now this way, and anon that, and ſo is variouſly inflected, and tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled up and down; in ſo much that ſometimes being entangled in his own <hi>Navel-ſtring,</hi> he is ſtrangely inſnared.

So likewiſe <hi>Embryo</hi>'s, which paſs their time

moſt in ſlumbers, do compoſe their bodies in that poſture wherein they are formed: (as being the moſt natural, moſt eaſie, and moſt advantagious for their ſleep.) And therefore the Infant in the Womb is commonly found, with his Knees drawn up to his Belly, his Thighs bent backwards, his Feet hanging down, and his Hands elevated to his Head, whereof the one is placed about his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or Ears, and the other at his Cheek; in which parts there are white ſpots diſcovered in the skin, as being the ſignes of his confrication: His Spine is bent round, and his Neck being inflected, his Head hangs neer his Knees. The <hi>Embryo</hi> is ſcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated with that <hi>poſition</hi> of parts, wherewith we commonly apply our ſelves to reſt, with his Head uppermoſt, and his Face directed towards his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>Spine.</hi> But a litle before his Birth, his head being bent downwards, he dives towards the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and the <hi>Orifice</hi> of the <hi>Matrix,</hi> (as if he were ſeeking his way out.)

               </note> to be various. <hi>There are,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>peculiar times of bearing to all kind of Animals, for the greateſt part as long as they live: for the race of Animals which is</hi>

               <hi>longer liv'd then others, muſt of neceſſity be more du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</hi> But the magnitude of the <hi>Animals</hi> is by him aſſigned as the chiefeſt cauſe of the variety of the times of bearing. <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, either of Animals, or any thing elſe, cannot be eaſily abſolved in a ſhort ſpace: Wherefore</hi> Mares, <hi>and thoſe Animals that are of kin to them, though they live but a ſhorter time, yet they are longer in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth: And therefore the</hi> Elephant <hi>(as they ſay) is two years in her production, becauſe of its exceſſive magnitude. But every Animal hath certain bounds of magnitude, which it cannot exceed:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have a definit matter, out of which they are made: he addeth moreover: <hi>But there is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding good reaſon, why Animals do receive the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſion or meaſure of their times of ingravidation, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and their lives alſo by certain Circulations. Now I call a Circulation, a day, a night, a moneth, a year, and all thoſe times which are deſcribed by them, as alſo the motions of the Moon: for theſe are the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon beginnings of Generation to all Animals: For it ſtands to good reaſon that the Circulations of leſs prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal things ſhould follow the Circulations of more prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal.</hi> And therefore <hi>Nature</hi> hath defined or limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the generation and deceaſe of <hi>Animals,</hi> by their motions.</p>
            <p>And as the Births of Animals do depend upon the Revolutions or Circuits of the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> ſo do their times of Coition, and bearing their young vary, and are either more prolixe, or breifer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The time of going with young</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the ſame place) <hi>is enormous onely in Women. For all other creatures have ſome one time, but a Woman hath ſeveral, for a Child may be borne either the Seventh, or the Tenth moneth, and likewiſe in the moneths in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervening</hi>
               <pb n="475" facs="tcp:56144:259"/>
               <hi>between the Seventh and the Tenth: For they that are borne in the Eighth moneth, though they do ſeldom live, yet they may live.</hi> Diverſe Animals have indeed a ſet time of bringing forth, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the <hi>Spring,</hi> when the <hi>Sun</hi> returnes; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe in the <hi>Summer,</hi> and ſome in the <hi>Autumne,</hi> as the <hi>Griſtley Fiſhes.</hi> And hence it happens, that when the time of bringing forth approacheth, they direct themſelves to their wonted places, where they may ſafely build their Stalls, or Neſts, where they may bring forth, cheriſh, and ſuſtaine their young.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that thoſe Winds which blow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the beginning of the ſpring, are called, <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>And likewiſe in the Spring, ſo ſoon as ever the Cankerwormes do appear, (whoſe ſeeds are for the moſt part carried about by the Winds like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Atomes; and are not begotten as people commonly believe, either of their own accord, or out of putrefaction) the trees do preſently ſhoot forth their buds, which are to become the ſuſtenance of thoſe creatures: and they themſelves alſo are purſued by ſmall Birds, and conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into their Neſts to be devoured by their young.</p>
            <p>So that whenſoever we ſee unuſual kinds of theſe Canker-wormes, we do likewiſe meet with ſeveral ſorts of forraign litle birds, which are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſeen at other times, (as if theſe Birds did

               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>Infants which have been conceived by a ſuperfoetation, have fallen from the Mother. But if the Mothers have been delivered in ſome ſhort time after, they have brought forth that Child which was begotten by a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfoetation: and ſo they bring them forth, like thoſe children which are born Twinnes: As the Fable runs of</hi> Iphicles <hi>and</hi> Hercules. <hi>And this hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready found to be ſo.</hi> For a certain Adultreſs brought <hi>forth two Children, one like her own Husband, and the other like the Adulterer.</hi> And likewiſe a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Woman</hi> a long <hi>while ſince, having Twinnes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in her, did conceive a third Child alſo, ſo that when the time of her delivery was fully come, ſhe brought forth the Twinnes in their juſt time, and they were perfect: but the third was but of five moneths time, and ſo he died inſtantly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A certain Servant-Maid being gotten with Child by her Maſter, to hide her knavery came to <hi>London</hi> in <hi>September,</hi> where ſhe <hi>Lay in</hi> by ſtealth: and being recovered again, returned home: but in <hi>December</hi> following, a new birth (for ſhe had a <hi>Superfoetation)</hi> did proclaime the crime which ſhe had cunningly concealed before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It happened to another Woman</hi> (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth) <hi>that when ſhe had brought forth one Child in the ſeventh moneth, ſhe was after two moneths end, delivered of two more, whereof the firſt Child died, but the Twins ſurvived. Likewiſe ſome Women that have ſuffered abortment, have conceived two Children at</hi>
               <pb n="480" facs="tcp:56144:261"/>
               <hi>the ſame time, whereof the one hath been aborted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time, and the other hath continued the full time, and been brought forth perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For it is an eaſie matter, that the firſt, or laſt Conception which is conceived by a <hi>Superfoetati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> being ejected after the third or fourth month, the following moneths may be reckoned more or leſs then they ought to be, eſpecially by credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous or unskilful Women.</p>
            <p>I have ſometimes known the Conception to periſh in the Womb, and being turned into Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid Matter, to have glided and iſſued forth: (like the <hi>flores albi)</hi> and this both in Women and other Animals. There was not long ſince a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in <hi>London,</hi> which after ſuch a kinde of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bortment did conceive again; and was delivered at the juſt time. But a litle after, as ſhe went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her worke, being not in any great paine, or diſtemper, ſhe did eject by peices the black li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Bones, which related to her former Abort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Some of theſe Bones were brought to me, which I could diſcover to be the fragments of the Spine, the Bone of the Thigh, and of other Bones.</p>
            <p>I know a young Woman, who was the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a Phyſitian, who was of my neer acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which being Big, felt all the Symptomes incident to Women in that condition; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing healthy and ſprightly, after the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth week ſhe perceived the motions of a <hi>Foetus</hi> in her Womb; and having finiſhed her time for going with Child, conceiving the hour of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery to be nigh at hand, ſhe had her Bed furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, her Cradle ready, and all the implements appertaining to the purpoſe laid out for uſe. But all theſe preparations came to nothing, and <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
               <pb n="481" facs="tcp:56144:261"/>
was croſs to her wiſhes; for her cuſtomary paines quite left her, and her Belly as it roſe by degrees, ſo it ſunk againe, and ſhee never ſicke for the matter, but ſhe remained barren ever after.</p>
            <p>I alſo knew a noble Matron, who had borne above ten Children, and whoſe <hi>Courſes</hi> were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuppreſſed unleſs ſhe were with Child. But being afterwards married to another Husband, beſides other uſual ſignes, ſhe apprehended her ſelf to be with Child, by the ſtirring of it (which both ſhe her ſelf, and her Siſter alſo, who then lay with her in bed, did many times in the night perceive) and all the Arguments I could ſuggeſt, could not remove that perſwaſion from her: till at the laſt, all her hopes vaniſhed into <hi>flatulency</hi> and <hi>fatneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that ſometimes, the moſt approved ſignes of <hi>Ingravidation,</hi> have not onely deluded the ſilly Women, but the experienced <hi>Midwives,</hi> and the skilful Phyſitians themſelves. Wherefore, ſince beſides the deceits of Women themſelves, there are ſeveral falſe Indications of Gravidation, we muſt not raſhly determine of the Inordinate Birth, before the Seventh Moneth, or after the Eleventh.</p>
            <p>The ordinary Computation of <hi>going with Child,</hi> obſerveth that time which our bleſſed Saviour, the perfecteſt of all men, did fulfil in the <hi>Virgins Wombe:</hi> namely, from the day of the <hi>Annunciation,</hi> which is in <hi>March,</hi> to that bleſſed day of the <hi>Nativity,</hi> which we celebrate in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember.</hi> And according to this <hi>Rule,</hi> the Sager <hi>Matrons</hi> keeping their account (while they caſt in the wonted day in every moneth, whereon they were accuſtomed to have their <hi>purgations)</hi> they
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:56144:262"/>
are ſeldom out of their <hi>Reckoning;</hi> but, ten <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions</hi> of the <hi>Moone</hi> beeng expired, they are <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,</hi> and reap the fruit of their <hi>Wombe,</hi> upon that very day whereon (were it not for their <hi>Praegnation)</hi> their <hi>Purgations</hi> would enſue.</p>
            <p>As concerning the cauſes of the <hi>excluſion</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery</hi> of the <hi>Foetus, Fabricius,</hi> beſides that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <note place="margin">

And this (he affirmeth) is not onely obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Men and Beaſts, but chiefly in Birds: which though they be ſmall, and have yet but a tender bill, yet will the Chickens peck that part of the ſhell, where they ſtand in moſt need of reſpiration: which thing they doe, being more ſtreightned for Breath, then A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liment: Seeing that immediately as ſoon they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped out of the ſhell they doe reſpire, but abſtaine from meat two or three dayes together.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whether <hi>Reſpiration</hi> be inſtituted for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frigeration,</hi> or for any other uſe: we ſhall more largely debate elſewhere, out of our <hi>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time I ſhall propoſe this <hi>Probleme</hi> to the Learned; namely, How the <hi>Embryo</hi> doth ſubſiſt after the <hi>ſeventh moneth</hi> in his <hi>Mothers womb?</hi> when yet in caſe he were borne, he would inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breath: nay he could not continue one ſmall
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:56144:262"/>
hour without it? and yet remaining in the <hi>womb,</hi> though he paſs the <hi>ninth moneth,</hi> he lives, and is ſafe without the help of <hi>Reſpiration.</hi> I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it yet more plainly. How commeth it to paſs, that the <hi>Foetus</hi> being now borne, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing yet covered over with his entire <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes,</hi> and abiding ſtill in his <hi>water,</hi> can ſubſiſt for ſome hours ſpace, without any danger of <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focation:</hi> and yet being ſhifted out of thoſe <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes,</hi> if he have but once attracted the Aire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his <hi>Lungs,</hi> he cannot afterwards live a minute without it, but dyeth inſtantly? doubtleſs this is not for want of <hi>Refrigeration:</hi> for in a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Delivery, he ſticketh faſt in the ſtreights with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Reſpiration,</hi> ſometimes for ſome houres together; and yet we find him alive: but yet ſo ſoon as he hath eſcaped, and taſted the <hi>vital air,</hi> if you deprive him of it, you deſtroy him in a moment. So likewiſe in the <hi>Ceſarean Section</hi> the Infant is taken out of his <hi>Mothers wombe,</hi> many houres after his Mothers deceaſe, and yet he is found alive, and continueth ſafe, without the uſe of <hi>Aire,</hi> though he lye intombed in the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundines:</hi> but having once attracted the Aire, (though you inſtantly reſtore him to the <hi>Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines</hi> againe) he will expire for want of <hi>breath.</hi> Whoſoever doth carefully conſider theſe things, and look narrowly into the nature of Aire, will (I ſuppoſe) eaſily grant, that the Air is allowed to Animals, neither for refrigeration, nor nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition ſake. For it is a tryed thing, that the <hi>Foetus</hi> is ſooner ſuffocated after he hath enjoyed the Aire, then when he was quite excluded from it: as if the <hi>Heat</hi> within him, were rather infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, then quenched by the Aire.</p>
            <p>But thus much we have diſcovered by the way
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:56144:263"/>
concerning <hi>Reſpiration;</hi> being perhaps reſolved to diſcuſs the debate more fully in its proper place: then which diſquiſition you ſhall hardly meet with a more nice; for it is debated with <hi>Arguments</hi> of almoſt equall weight on both ſides.</p>
            <p>I return to the Birth, which <hi>Fabricius</hi> conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to come to paſs (beſides the fore-mentioned neceſſity of Reſpiration, and want of Suſtenance) <hi>becauſe the Foetus being grown bigger, doth preſs out by his weight; and alſo can be no longer conteined within, by reaſon of his large bulk; and likewiſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Excrements are ſo multiplied, that there is no longer place for them in the membranes.</hi> But we have already proved, that the <hi>humours</hi> in the Wombe are not <hi>Excrementitious.</hi> Nor is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon deduced from the Weight and Magnitude of the <hi>Foetus</hi> more available then the former: for the <hi>Foetus</hi> ſwimming aloof in the <hi>humours,</hi> is ſcarce any burden at all to the <hi>After-birth</hi> or <hi>Womb;</hi> for ſome <hi>Infants</hi> of nine moneths are very litle, and leſs then ſome others of eight moneths onely, yet can they no longer ſubſiſt in the Womb. And as to the Weight, <hi>Twins</hi> of eight moneths do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderate any one ſingle <hi>Foetus</hi> whatſoever, though of nine moneths abode in the Womb, yet are they not born till the nineth moneth. Nor can we quarrel at the ſcarcity of Aliment: ſince at that time there is entertainment enough even for <hi>Twins,</hi> and ſometimes for more <hi>Infants:</hi> and alſo the milk which is conducted to the Breaſts of Women in <hi>Child-bed,</hi> being recalled to the <hi>Uterus,</hi> would as conveniently ſupply the <hi>foetus</hi> in the Womb, as out of it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall rather impute the <hi>cauſe</hi> of <hi>being born,</hi> to the juice conteined in the <hi>Amnion,</hi> which being
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:56144:263"/>
moſt proportionate to the nouriſhing of the <hi>Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> doth either much faile, or elſe is depraved by the admixture of the ſuperfluities. As I have alſo hinted before.</p>
            <p>But as for the diverſity of <hi>going with Child,</hi> which is contrary to the time allotted by Nature (which diverſity doth chiefly reſpect Women) I do aſcribe it to the cuſtome of living, the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the conſtitution, and the ſeveral paſſions incident to Women. And therefore thoſe tame Animals, which live amongſt us, by reaſon of their lazy lives, and plenty of food, are of more incertainty in their times of Coition, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, then wild Beaſts, which live according to Natures intent. Likewiſe ſickly Women have eaſier and greater diſpatch in their <hi>Travaile,</hi> then others: but it falls out clean contrary to ſuch Women, whoſe ſtrength is very much conſumed. For the ſame thing befalls them, as happeneth to <hi>Plants,</hi> whoſe fruits and ſeeds, do more ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſeldom arrive to maturity in cold Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, then to other <hi>Plants</hi> of the ſame kind which are in a fat and warm ſoile.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Orenges</hi> in <hi>England</hi> adhere to the trees al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt two whole years together, before they come to maturity: and <hi>Figgs</hi> alſo ſcarce ever arrive at any perfection here, which are ripe in <hi>Italy</hi> twice or thrice a year. And the like befalleth the fruits of the <hi>Womb;</hi> namely, the <hi>Foetus</hi> is brought to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity ſooner or later, by reaſon of the ſcarcity or plenty of Aliment, the imbecillity, or ſtrength of the body, and the orderly or inordinate regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life (according to the ſix non-naturall things recited by Phyſitians.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fabricius</hi> hath deſcribed the Manner of the Birth, thus: <hi>The Womb being dilated by the weight</hi>
               <pb n="486" facs="tcp:56144:264"/>
               <hi>of the</hi> Foetus; <hi>in ſo much that it can now be no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſtended, and thereupon being excited to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burden</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Birth.</note> 
               <hi>it ſelf, is by the motion of the tranſverſe fibres gathered up into it ſelfe, and ſo contracted into a narrower compaſs. And therefore, whereas before, neither the Excrements, by means of their abundance, nor the</hi> Foetus <hi>by reaſon of his weight could be contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned any longer, the</hi> Uterus <hi>being more ſtreightned and drawn together then it was, can be much leſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to contein them, and therefore firſt the membranes as being the weaker parts, and more diſtended, do break, and the humour which is moſt fluxile, doth firſt paſs out to make the parts glibbe. And hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the</hi> Foetus <hi>followeth, as being not onely increaſed in his weight (by reaſon that he now no longer ſwimmeth in the humour) and ſo deſcendeth downwards, forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Orifice of the Womb, but as being alſo compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, driven forward, and ſhut out by the action of the Womb itſelfe: in which act on, the muſcles of the</hi> Abdomer, <hi>together with the</hi> Midriffe, <hi>are wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully aſſiſtant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which words he deſcribes the ejectment of the Excrements of the Guts, and an Abortion ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then a Natural Birth: for though the <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes</hi> in Women do for the moſt part break, and ſo diſload the Water before the Birth; yet that is not always ſo: for other Animals do not bring forth as they do, but produce the Entire Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception together, (namely the <hi>foetus</hi> together with the <hi>Secundines)</hi> as we may obſerve in <hi>Ewes, Mares, Bitches,</hi> and other Animals: and eſpecially in the <hi>Viper,</hi> which doth conceive within an Egge which is of one onely colour, having a ſoft ſhell (ſuch as the <hi>humane conception</hi> is) and continueth that Conception ſo long within her, until a <hi>foetus</hi> be formed thereout, which ſhe doth produce wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:56144:264"/>
up in a membrane, which membrane (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Ariſtotle)</hi> is broken up the third day. And yet it ſo happeneth, ſometimes, that the young <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hiſt. an. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 34.</note> ones are produced, having eaten through the membranes, (while they are yet in the <hi>Uterus.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo alſo it is no novelty to experienced Midwives, that their Women do ſometimes bring forth their Conceptions whole, and entire, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any breach in the Membranes at all. And this kind of birth ſeemeth to me the moſt <hi>Natural;</hi> wherein the <hi>foetus</hi> (like a <hi>mellow fruit</hi> which drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth from the <hi>tree,</hi> without ſhaking out its ſeed before the time aſſigned by <hi>nature)</hi> is born with the <hi>Secundines</hi> embracing it. But, where it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth otherwiſe to paſs, and the After-burden doth adhere to the <hi>Uterus</hi> after the Child is borne: it is oftentimes hardly divided from it, and doth induce evil <hi>Symptomes,</hi> which are accompanied with noiſome ſmells, and ſometimes with a <hi>Gangreen,</hi> whereby the Mother is brought into imminent danger.</p>
            <p>Becauſe therefore the <hi>Birth</hi> deſcribed by <hi>Fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi> is not agreeable to all kinds of <hi>Births,</hi> but onely to Women, and not to all their Births nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but to ſuch onely whoſe Births are prema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and as it were forced: it is to be ranked rather amongſt <hi>preternatural, precipitate,</hi> and in ſome ſort abortive productions.</p>
            <p>In a <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Genuine Birth,</hi> therefore, two <note place="margin">Two things required in a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Birth.</note> things are required, which are aſſiſtant the one to the other, that is to ſay, the Woman in travaile, and the <hi>Foetus</hi> which is to be produced. Both which, except they be ripe for the buſineſs, the Birth is hardly ſucceſsful. For if the <hi>Foetus</hi> being diſquiet, and coveting to be enlarged, doe prevent his parent by exciting her, and offering
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:56144:265"/>
violence to her womb: or if the Mother, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the infirmity of her retention, (as if her womb were diſturbed with a kind of nauſeouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) or by ſome neceſſity of expulſion, be before hand with the Infant, the Birth is to be reputed a Diſeaſe or Symptome, rather then a Natural and critical Production. As alſo when ſome parts of the conception eſcape out, and others are ſtil retaind within: namly, if the <hi>Foetus</hi> attempt a departure ere the After-burden be diſmiſſed from the ſides of the Womb; or elſe the After-burden, on the contrary, be looſe from the <hi>Ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> the <hi>foetus</hi> being not rightly compoſed, nor the <hi>Uterus</hi> relaxed for the accommodation of the work. And therefore the younger, more giddy, and officious Midwives are to be rebuked; which, when they hear the woman in travaile, cry out for paine, and call for help; leſt they ſhould ſeem unskilful at their trade, and leſs buſie then comes to their ſhare, by daubing over their hands with oyles, and diſtending the parts of the <hi>Uterus,</hi> do mightily beſtirre themſelves, and provoke the expulſive faculty by medicinal poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: ſo that being impatient of a competent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, by their deſire to haſten and promote the Birth, they do rather retard and pervert it, and make it an unnatural and difficult delivery; and leaving the Membranes, or ſome part of the <hi>After-burden</hi> ſtill adhering to the Womb, they do both expoſe the poor women to the injuries of the Aire; and vainly perſwading them to their three-legged ſtoole, weary them out, and bring them in danger of their lives. It is much happier with poor women, and thoſe that dare not own their great bellies, where the Midwives help is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver required; for the longer they retain and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:56144:265"/>
the Birth, the eaſier, and more ſucceſsfull proves the delivery.</p>
            <p>And therefore there are chiefly two ſorts of Unnatural Births; namely when the <hi>foetus</hi> is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>born before,</hi> or <hi>after the time</hi> allotted by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: (and this is a kinde of Abortive Birth) and the Birth proves difficult and painful, becauſe it doth not ſucceed in that manner, and order as it ought to do: or elſe is hindered by ſome bad <hi>Symptomes:</hi> which cometh to paſs cheifly for two reaſons: namely, in that the Mother doth faile in her expulſive office, or elſe that the <hi>Foetus</hi> is himſelf but ſluggiſh, and ſo doth not promote his own releaſe: for a facile and natural delivery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieth upon the endavour and joint furtherance of both parties.</p>

               <hi>Fabricius</hi> doth aſcribe the work of bringing forth to the <hi>Uterus, to which performance,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Muſcles of the Lower Belly, and the Midrifle are aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</hi> But when I conſider the matter throughly, the throws of the woman in travaile do ſeem to proceed from the Motion and Agitation of all the Body, (juſt as we find it in Sternutation.) I knew a young Woman, which by reaſon of her extream torment in her travaile fell into a Sowne; and became inſtantly ſo conſternated, ſtupid, and ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, that nothing could recover her. I being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in to her cure (finding that <hi>Clyſters,</hi> and other proper remedies had been applied to no purpoſe, and that nothing could go down her throat) I put up a feather which was dipped in a ſtrong <hi>Sneezing medicine,</hi> into her <hi>Noſe;</hi> by which being moved (though ſhe was ſo overwhelmed with a deep ſtupidity, that ſhe could neither <hi>ſneeze,</hi> nor be <hi>awaked)</hi> ſhe began to be ſeized by a kind of <hi>general Convulſion,</hi> all her <hi>body</hi> over, which begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:56144:266"/>
at the <hi>ſhoulders,</hi> did by degrees extend it ſelf to the <hi>lower parts.</hi> But as often as I applied this <hi>provocation</hi> to her, her delivery was advanced and came on, and at laſt, the Mother being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of it her ſelf, and remaining ſtill in her ſleepy condition, a healthy and ſprightly Child was <hi>born</hi> into the world.</p>
            <p>We may obſerve the manner of their <hi>throwes,</hi> in other <hi>Animals:</hi> (as in the <hi>Ewe,</hi> the <hi>Bitch,</hi> and in great <hi>Cattel)</hi> wherein we ſhall diſcover that it is not by the <hi>ſole action</hi> of the <hi>Uterus,</hi> or <hi>Belly</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but is the joint conflict of <hi>all the whole body.</hi> And how much the <hi>Foetus</hi> doth conferre to the <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celeration</hi> and <hi>facilitating</hi> of his owne <hi>Birth,</hi> is cheifly <hi>evident</hi> in <hi>Oviparous Creatures:</hi> for it is apparent that the <hi>Foetus</hi> it ſelf, and not the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> doth break through the ſhell. By which it is probable that in <hi>Viviparous births</hi> alſo, the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt cauſe of being born is owed to the <hi>Foetus it ſelf,</hi> and that, to his induſtry and indeavour, and not to his weight, as <hi>Fabricius</hi> conceiveth. For what doth the weight thereof conduce to the birth in <hi>four-footed beaſts</hi> which ſtand upright, or ſit down; or in <hi>Women</hi> which lye along? nor doth the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of the <hi>foetus</hi> proceed, as he ſuppoſeth, from its largeneſs of bulk, or the plenty of the water, (the <hi>Water</hi> indeed is the cauſe of the <hi>delivery</hi> of the <hi>foetus</hi> which is dead and putrified in the <hi>womb,</hi> in that by its <hi>corruption</hi> and <hi>acrimony</hi> it doth exti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate the <hi>Uterus</hi> to relieve it ſelf) but the <hi>foetus</hi> himſelf ſets open the <hi>Gates</hi> of the <hi>Womb</hi> with his head turned downward, and unlocks their inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure by his own force, and ſo ſtruggleth himſelf into the world by <hi>conqueſt:</hi> And therefore that kind of <hi>birth</hi> is counted the nimbler and more fortunate. But when the <hi>Child comes into the world</hi>
               <pb n="491" facs="tcp:56144:266"/>
               <hi>thruſting his feet formoſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Pliny, the birth is counted unnatural, and thoſe that are ſo born are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi>

            </p>
            <p>That the aſſiſtance of the <hi>foetus</hi> is chiefly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the <hi>birth,</hi> is evident, not in <hi>Birds</hi> onely, which do by their own induſtry without the help of their <hi>Parent</hi> break up the <hi>ſhell;</hi> but alſo in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Animals;</hi> for all <hi>Flies,</hi> and <hi>Butterflies,</hi> doe perforate the <hi>litle membranes</hi> (in which they did lurk when they were the Worme <hi>Aurelia)</hi> and likewiſe the <hi>Silk-worm</hi> doth at his appointed time mollifie and erode the litle <hi>Silken bagge,</hi> which he had weaved for his defence and ſecurity, and ſo gets out without any forraign aide. And in like manner, <hi>Waſps, Beetles,</hi> and other <hi>Inſects;</hi> and all <hi>Fiſhes,</hi> are borne without others helps; as doth chiefly appear in the Raie, the Fork-fiſh, the Lamprey, and all cartilagineous Fiſhes, which do conceive their Egges within themſelves, and thoſe perfect ones, and <hi>party-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured,</hi> (being furniſhed with a <hi>Yolk</hi> and <hi>White)</hi> and concluded in a ſtrong <hi>cartilagineous quadran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular</hi>
               <pb n="492" facs="tcp:56144:267"/>
               <hi>ſhell:</hi> out of which being detained within the <hi>Belly</hi> and the <hi>Uterus,</hi> they do form their young; which breaking open the ſhell by force, do get abroad: as alſo the young <hi>Vipers,</hi> by their eroſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>membrane</hi> which conteineth the Egge, do ſometimes in their <hi>Mothers Bowels,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as they ſtick in the very paſſage, and other times at the end of two or three daies <hi>after their nativity,</hi> expoſe themſelves to the wide World. From whence that Fable, that the <hi>Vipers</hi> do eat their way through their Mothers bowels, and ſo revenge the death of their Father, took its foundation: When yet they do no more then all other <hi>iſſues</hi> which come into the world, breaking through the membranes which encompaſs them, either in their very <hi>Birth</hi> it ſelf, or a litle after it.</p>
            <p>But how great furtherance the <hi>foetus</hi> doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre to its own <hi>Birth,</hi> ſeveral obſervations doe clearly evince. A certain <hi>Woman</hi> here amongſt us (I ſpeak it knowingly) was, (being dead over night) left alone in her Chamber: but the next morning an Infant was there found between her <hi>Leggs,</hi> which had by his own force wrought his <hi>releaſe. Gregorius Nymmanus,</hi> hath collected cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine examples of this nature out of approved Authors.</p>
            <p>I alſo knew a <hi>Woman,</hi> who had all the interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our part of the neck of her <hi>Womb</hi> excoriated and torne, by a <hi>difficult</hi> and <hi>painful delivery:</hi> ſo that her time of <hi>Lying in</hi> being over, though ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with Child againe afterward, yet not onely the ſides of the <hi>Orifice</hi> of the <hi>Neck</hi> of the <hi>Womb</hi> neer the <hi>Nymphae</hi> did cloſe together, but all the whole <hi>Cavity</hi> thereof, even to the <hi>inner Orifice</hi> of the <hi>Matrix,</hi> whereby there was no entrance even
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:56144:267"/>
for a ſmall <hi>probe,</hi> nor yet any egreſs to her <hi>uſual fluxes.</hi> Hereupon the time of her delivery being now arrived, the poor ſoul was lamentably tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, and laying aſide all expectation of being delivered, ſhe reſigned up her keys to her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and ſetting her affairs in order, ſhe took leave of all her friends. When behold, beyond expectation, by the ſtrong conteſt of a very luſty Infant, the whole tract was forced open, and ſhe was miraculouſly <hi>delivered;</hi> the luſty Child pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>author of his own,</hi> and <hi>his Parents life,</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the paſſage open for the reſt of his Brethren who ſhould be borne in time to come. For, proper applications being adminiſtered, his Mother was reſtored to her former health.</p>
            <p>I ſhall adde one example more memorable then this. The Queen had an exceeding white <hi>Mare,</hi> excellently ſhaped, preſented unto her: whoſe <hi>genitall parts</hi> (leſt by going to Horſe ſhee might endanger the beauty of her proportions, and become unfit for uſe) were, as the cuſtome is, locked up all with iron rings. Notwithſtanding which, this <hi>Mare</hi> (by what accident I cannot tell, nor could the Groomes inform me) was made <hi>big with Foale:</hi> and at laſt, when they fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red no ſuch matter, ſhe foaled by night, and the <hi>Foale</hi> was found alive next morning by the <hi>mares</hi> ſide. When I came to heare thereof, I went preſently to the Stables, and ſaw both the <hi>labia</hi> of the <hi>lap,</hi> which were locked up with <hi>rings,</hi> and all the <hi>privity</hi> towards the left ſide, ſo torne and dilacerated from the <hi>right haunch-bone,</hi> that the unity of that moſt tight part being diſſolved, by the incredible force of the young <hi>Foale,</hi> hee might eaſily finde a paſſage through that wide gap. So forcible is the vigour and efficacy of a <hi>mature</hi> and <hi>liuely Foetus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="494" facs="tcp:56144:268"/>
But on the contrary, in caſe the <hi>Foetus</hi> be ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and languiſhing, or borne before its time; it is not properly a <hi>birth,</hi> but an <hi>abortment:</hi> and the <hi>Foetus</hi> is rather <hi>ejected,</hi> then <hi>borne:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though he be now ſome dayes old, he will neither take the <hi>breaſt</hi> kindly, nor depoſite his <hi>excrements</hi> as he ought to doe.</p>
            <p>And yet the <hi>Uterus</hi> hath its ſhare in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Delivery:</hi> as ſhall appear in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing example. A poor woman, who was a <hi>Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs,</hi> did for a long time labour under the <hi>Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down,</hi> or precipitation of her <hi>wombe,</hi> and the <hi>ſheath</hi> thereof did hang down to the bigneſs of ones <hi>fiſt,</hi> and at length, uſing no applications to it, her grief grew ſo forcible upon her, that it now begun to reſemble a <hi>Scrotum,</hi> the skin being rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and ſqualid; and yet found now leſs paine or trouble in it, then ſhe was formerly uſed to find, when it newly bore down. But, ſhe asking my advice, I counſelled her to keep her <hi>Bed</hi> for ſome certain dayes, and to mollifie the <hi>dryer parts</hi> thereof with <hi>fomentations,</hi> and <hi>oyntments,</hi> and ſo when her <hi>wombe</hi> was reduced into her <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> to keep it ſtill up with <hi>peſſaries</hi> and <hi>ſwathes,</hi> till by the uſe of drying and ſtrengthening re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies it was confirmed and ſetled in its <hi>proper place.</hi> The cure did for ſome time ſucceed to our wiſh; but ſhe being poor, was fain to fall to her calling again, to get money, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting her appointed <hi>applications,</hi> ſhe fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>relapſe,</hi> and endured it pretty well, her <hi>womb</hi> ſometimes retiring back again, and ſometimes continuing quite out; but for the moſt part, at night ſhe did reduce it, and there it remained for ſome time. But after many dayes, ſhe addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her ſelf to me again, complaining that her
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:56144:268"/>
               <hi>wombe</hi> being ſwelled by the uſe of her remedies, and eſpecially of her <hi>fomentations</hi> (as ſhe concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) would now no longer abide in her body. And yet applying ſome <hi>oyntments</hi> which I had preſcribed, ſhe had forced it in againe, but her cure did not continue long: for no ſooner did ſhe riſe, and ſtand upon her leggs, and ſo goe about her work, but her <hi>wombe</hi> did preſently, by reaſon of its <hi>bulke</hi> and <hi>weight,</hi> diſturbe her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and would eaſily beare downe upon any occaſion. And now at this time it was as large as a <hi>Bulls Cod,</hi> dangling between her leggs,: ſo that I ſuſpected, that not onely the <hi>ſheath,</hi> but that the <hi>womb it ſelfe</hi> was now inverted, or elſe that ſhee was diſeaſed with a <hi>Uterine Hernia,</hi> or <hi>rupture.</hi> It grew at laſt bigger then a <hi>mans head,</hi> being then a hard tumour, and hanging downe to her <hi>knees</hi> did much pain her, ſo that ſhe could not goe (but upon all foure) and breaking juſt in the bottom of it, it did effund a moiſture (as if it had been an <hi>Ulcer)</hi> and blood with it. Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it (for I did not explore it by touch) I did ſuſpect it to be a <hi>Cancer</hi> of the <hi>wombe,</hi> and therefore did bethink my ſelfe of a <hi>Ligature,</hi> and cutting it off: and in the interim, I adviſed her to apply gentle <hi>fomentations</hi> to it to aſſwage the paine. But the following night, an <hi>Infant</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſhaped, of a ſpan long, was caſt out of that <hi>Tumour,</hi> but it was dead; and the next morning they brought it to me; which having <hi>embowelled,</hi> I kept ſwimming in cold water without corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſome moneths time, ſhewing it to many of my friends (as a miraculous ſpectacle.) The skin in this <hi>Foetus</hi> was not yet formed; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a thin paring appeared (ſuch as lieth about a <hi>Codlin)</hi> which I eaſily drew away whole and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire;
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:56144:269"/>
whereupon all the <hi>muſcles</hi> diſcloſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves very diſtinctly, (for the <hi>Foetus</hi> was leane.) What other matters I obſerved in the diſſection of this <hi>Foetus,</hi> ſhall be related elſewhere: in this place, I thought it onely convenient to ſignifie, how the <hi>Matrix</hi> it ſelf alone did promote this <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bortive,</hi> and did eject this <hi>Foetus</hi> by its owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fabricius</hi> doth propoſe two things worthy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration <note place="margin">
                  <hi>De form. foet. pag.</hi> 142.</note> (as he ſaith) in the <hi>birth,</hi> and after it: the firſt is concerning the dilatation of the <hi>Uterus</hi> in the <hi>Birth:</hi> and the other is, of the reduction of the <hi>Uterus</hi> after the <hi>Birth</hi> into its former com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs and narrowneſs: Wondering that the <hi>womb</hi> ſhould be ſo much diſtended to make way for the <hi>foetus,</hi> and that in a ſhort time after delivery, it ſhould retire into its priſtine dimenſion.</p>
            <p>How the Neck of the Womb, which is thick, hard, and ſo ſhut up, that it will not admit a <hi>ſlender probe,</hi> ſhould ſubſcribe to ſo vaſt a diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the time of <hi>Delivery, We may with</hi> Galen <note place="margin">

               <hi>admire,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>but we ſhall never comprehend it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet he gives this Reaſon for it, namely <hi>That the</hi> Uterus, <hi>while it is not pregnant, is a thick and hard body, ſo likewiſe is its orifice; but being impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, it becomes ſoft and thin: and the nearer it drawes to delivery, ſo much the more is the ſubſtance, and by conſequence its orifice too, made thinner, and ſofter.</hi> And this he conceiveth to be effected <hi>by its diſtention; which being diſtended, its compact and complicated body</hi> (if he may ſo ſpeak) <hi>is expanded and ſmoothed, and ſo, though it was thick and hard before, yet now it is rendred thin and ſoft, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently fit to afford an exit to the</hi> foetus. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he ſaith, <hi>There was one, who once enquired of me, how, if it be ſo indeed, it can be true that in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
               <pb n="497" facs="tcp:56144:269"/>
               <hi>with childe the orifice of the womb is ſo occluded, that not ſo much as a ſmall probe can get into it? I make anſwer, that it came to be ſo, in that the womb while it is diſtended, and is unfolded like a linnen cloth that is compacted and folded up together, doth begin to be raiſed up firſt in its upper part, and there to be unfolded, and after it the lower parts do by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees begin to diſtend, till at the laſt that diſtending faculty doth arrive at the very orifice of the womb it ſelf; which is convenient to be ſo then, when the</hi> Ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus <hi>is inclining towards delivery. Wherefore the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the womb is deſervedly ſhut for the firſt months, (whileſt it is craſs and obdurate) but in the laſt dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And thus much touching</hi> Galens <hi>unknown cauſe: we might alſo adde other Reaſons, whereby the dilatation of the womb becometh more eaſie, as, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the Excrements of the</hi> Foetus, <hi>namely the Sweat and the Urine: which though they are contained in their own proper membranes and receptacles, yet may the power of Humectation arrive even unto this Orifice, eſpecially ſince it is placed below, and neer to theſe humours, being alwaies preſent with them. Adde alſo moreover, that a certain mucous and pituitous ſubſtance is alwaies found about the orifice of the womb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, in my opinion, this worthy man is miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; for the Neck of the womb is not hard by complication, but of its own eſſence, and ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous conſtitution: and likewiſe, thoſe accidental Cauſes (which he alledgeth) are of litle advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to this purpoſe. For, doubtleſs, this is done by the Divine Providence of <hi>Nature</hi> (as well as the reſt of the wonderfull Fabrick of the <hi>Body)</hi> which doth direct her workmanſhip to a certain <hi>End, Action,</hi> and <hi>Uſe.</hi> The <hi>Wombs</hi> conſtitution therefore is ſuch, that in the firſt Conception it
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:56144:270"/>
ſhould have its nervous Orifice conſtringed, for <hi>retention</hi> ſake, which afterwards in the delivery of the <hi>foetus</hi> (like the <hi>fruit</hi> in the <hi>Tree)</hi> doth of <hi>hard</hi> become <hi>ſoft</hi> and <hi>mellow,</hi> for the convenience of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion:</hi> and that not from any <hi>unfolding,</hi> but from the <hi>alteration</hi> of its <hi>Temper;</hi> for even the conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion of the <hi>bones</hi> themſelves, namely the <hi>Synchon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droſis</hi> of the <hi>Haunch-bone</hi> with the <hi>Share,</hi> and <hi>Holy-bone,</hi> &amp; the <hi>ſynneureſis</hi> or <hi>natural union</hi> or <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alition</hi> of the <hi>Rump,</hi> or utmoſt end of the <hi>Os Sacrum</hi> is diſſolved and mollified. It is indeed a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing, that the <hi>litle bud</hi> of a <hi>growing Nut</hi> (as ſuppoſe of the <hi>Kernel</hi> of an <hi>Almond,</hi> or other <hi>Fruit)</hi> ſhould break thoſe bones which a <hi>Malet</hi> can hardly bruiſe: and that the tender <hi>fibers</hi> of the <hi>Ivy-root</hi> crawling along the narrow chinks or crannies of <hi>ſtones,</hi> ſhould at laſt demoliſh large <hi>walls.</hi> But it is nothing ſo wonderfull, that the <hi>genital parts</hi> of <hi>Women</hi> which are relaxed in the <hi>birth,</hi> ſhould afterward <hi>harden,</hi> and draw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together, becauſe it is natural to thoſe parts; eſpecially if we conſider that the <hi>Yard</hi> of the <hi>Male</hi> is in <hi>coition</hi> very much <hi>ſtretched,</hi> and <hi>hardened,</hi> and anon doth <hi>flagge,</hi> and <hi>ſoften.</hi> We are more to admire (which is beyond all <hi>plica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> or <hi>folding)</hi> that the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the <hi>Uterus</hi> is not onely dayly <hi>amplified</hi> and <hi>diſtended,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>growth</hi> of the <hi>foetus,</hi> (as if it were, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opinion of <hi>Fabricius,</hi> unfolded) but doth <hi>grow thicker,</hi> more <hi>carnous,</hi> and <hi>ſtronger</hi> then before.

            </p>
            <p>By which argument it appeareth, that the <hi>Ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> is the chiefeſt of the Parts dedicated to <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:</hi> for the <hi>Teſticles</hi> are conſtituted for the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture</hi> or <hi>ſeed;</hi> but the <hi>ſeed</hi> for <hi>coition;</hi> and <hi>coi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> it ſelf, or <hi>emiſſion</hi> of <hi>ſeed,</hi> that the <hi>Uterus</hi> may receive <hi>fecundity,</hi> and ſo <hi>generation</hi> enſue thereby.</p>
            <p>We have formerly ſaid, that the <hi>Egge</hi> is as it were the <hi>fruit</hi> of <hi>Animals,</hi> and as it were an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Womb. Now on the contrary, we ſhall contemplate the <hi>Uterus</hi> as an <hi>Egge</hi> reſiding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. For as <hi>Trees,</hi> at ſet times, do flouriſh with <hi>leaves, flowers,</hi> and <hi>fruits:</hi> and <hi>Oviparous Animals</hi>
               <pb n="500" facs="tcp:56144:271"/>
do ſometimes generate <hi>eggs,</hi> and <hi>lay;</hi> but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they grow emerit, and the place or part which did contain them is not to be found: ſo alſo <hi>Viviparous Animals</hi> have their <hi>Spring,</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumne.</hi> At the Seaſons of <hi>fecunditie</hi> and <hi>genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> the Genital parts, eſpecially in Females, are very much altered: inſomuch that the <hi>Ovary</hi> in <hi>Birds,</hi> which at other times is conſpicuous, doth then appear ſomething turgid: and the <hi>Belly</hi> of <hi>Fiſhes,</hi> about the time of <hi>Spawning,</hi> doth much exceed all the <hi>reſt</hi> of their <hi>body,</hi> by reaſon of the multitude of their <hi>eggs,</hi> and <hi>affluence</hi> of their <hi>ſeed</hi> or <hi>ſpawne.</hi> In many <hi>Viviparous Animals,</hi> the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitals (namely the <hi>Uterus,</hi> and <hi>Spermatical Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels)</hi> are perceived to be at ſome times of a diverſe Conſtitution, Temper, and Fabrick; but as they grow <hi>pregnant,</hi> or <hi>forbear to be ſo,</hi> ſo do they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly change; ſo that a man can hardly know them for the ſame things. For as in Nature no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is wanting, ſo there is no ſuperfluity. And therefore the Genital parts, when there is no more uſe of them, do wither, are retracted, and as it were obliterated and expunged.</p>
            <p>At the times of <hi>Coition,</hi> the <hi>Teſticles</hi> are conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous in <hi>male Hares,</hi> and <hi>Moles,</hi> and the Hornes are then viſible in the <hi>Uterus</hi> of their <hi>females.</hi> It were ſtrange to relate, how great an affluence of <hi>ſeed</hi> is then conſpicuous in the larger ſort of <hi>Moles,</hi> and <hi>Mice,</hi> in which at other times no <hi>ſeed</hi> at all is to be ſeen (but their Teſticles are extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated and retracted into their Bellies) but when they forgoe <hi>impregnation,</hi> there is hardly any ſuch thing as a <hi>Uterus</hi> to be perceivd: inſomuch that it is a difficult matter to diſtinguiſh Male from Femal.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Womb</hi> doth, chiefly in <hi>Women,</hi> exceedingly
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:56144:271"/>
vary both in Temper, as alſo in thoſe Adjuncts which follow the Temper (namely Scituation, Magnitude, Figure, Colour, Thickneſs, Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp; Denſity.) Unripe <hi>Virgins,</hi> as their <hi>Breaſts</hi> are no bigger then the Breaſts of Boyes; ſo is their <hi>Uterus</hi> very ſmall, white, of a skinny ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, deſtitute of Veines, and in magnitude, not exceeding the top of ones <hi>Thumb,</hi> or a large <hi>Bean.</hi> So alſo antient <hi>Women,</hi> as their <hi>breaſts</hi> do ſink, ſo have they a retreated, flaggy, lank, pallid <hi>Womb,</hi> void of Veins and Blood. Which I alſo conceive to be the <hi>cauſe,</hi> why <hi>Women</hi> growing <hi>Antient</hi> have not their monthly <hi>Termes:</hi> but that they deſcend into the <hi>Haemorrhoides,</hi> or elſe do abruptly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them, and ſo endanger their health.

<pb n="502" facs="tcp:56144:272"/>
and Outragiouſneſs, the <hi>praeternatural Diſeaſes</hi> of the Womb do induce, as if the affected Perſons were inchanted: as alſo how many difficult <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,</hi> the depraved effluxion of the Terms, or the uſe of <hi>Venus</hi> much intermitted, and long deſired do foment. Nor is it leſs known, how great an Alteration doth befall <hi>Virgins,</hi> when their <hi>Uterus</hi> doth enlarge, and is tepefied, for they grow ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and their Complexion doth improve; their Breaſts ſtrut forth, they become more beautifull, their Eyes gliſten, their Voice is more tunable, their Gate, Geſture, and Diſcourſe, are more gracefull then formerly; and their more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous <hi>Diſtempers</hi> are at this time, or never, cured.</p>
            <p>I knew a noble <hi>Lady,</hi> which was wilde by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a <hi>Uterine Melancholy</hi> and <hi>Diſtemper,</hi> for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ten years together: and when all <hi>Remedies</hi> had been in vain employed, ſhe fell at laſt into the Bearing down of the <hi>Uterus;</hi> which accident, contrary to others judgement, I did prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate would conduce to her health; and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her not to return her <hi>womb,</hi> untill its diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was aſſwaged by the outward <hi>cold aire:</hi> the ſucceſs was anſwerable to my perſwaſion, and in a ſhort time ſhe was perfectly cured; and her <hi>womb</hi> being at laſt reſtored to its ſeat, did remaine there, and ſhe lives a healthy life, even to this day.</p>
            <p>I knew another <hi>Woman,</hi> which was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with <hi>Hyſterical ſymptoms,</hi> ſuch as no Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications could ſubdue; who at length af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many yeares was cured by the Bearing down of the <hi>Womb.</hi> And both theſe being relieved in their <hi>Symptoms,</hi> I did reſtore their <hi>wombs</hi> to their places with happy ſucceſs. For the <hi>Uterus</hi> being by any ſharp <hi>humour</hi> excited violently to
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:56144:272"/>
expulſion, doth not onely gently <hi>bear down,</hi> but (like unto the <hi>Right Gut</hi> when it is irritated by a troubleſom <hi>Teneſmus)</hi> doth precipitate it ſelf outward.</p>
            <p>Divers therefore is the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of the <hi>Ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus;</hi> and that not onely <hi>praeternatural,</hi> but <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> alſo, namely, in the time of <hi>Fecundity,</hi> and <hi>Barrenneſs.</hi> In young <hi>Girles,</hi> and <hi>Women paſt Childing,</hi> it is (as I have ſaid) of the magnitude of a <hi>Bean,</hi> and without any <hi>blood:</hi> in a <hi>Virgin</hi> ripe for a <hi>husband,</hi> it reſembleth the bulk and form of a <hi>Pear:</hi> in <hi>fruitfull Women,</hi> and ſuch as are apt to conceive, it is as large as a <hi>ſmall Gourd,</hi> or a <hi>Gooſe-egge;</hi> and doth likewiſe ſwell as the <hi>breaſts</hi> do, and growing more laxe and fleſhy, it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth warme; and as <hi>Virgil</hi> ſpeaketh of the Fields,</p>

            <p>Wherefore their <hi>Terms</hi> being now at hand, or newly over, whileſt the <hi>warmth</hi> and <hi>moiſture</hi> of the Part (which are two <hi>neceſſary cauſes</hi> of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration)</hi> do remain, <hi>Women</hi> are moſt apt to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</hi> And ſo other <hi>Animals</hi> likewiſe (when they are excited to <hi>Venery)</hi> their Genital parts are <hi>moiſt, turgid,</hi> and <hi>ſwelled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this <hi>Conſtitution</hi> I have found in the <hi>Womb,</hi> before the <hi>Birth.</hi> But in <hi>Women</hi> with <hi>Child,</hi> the <hi>Uterus</hi> (as hath been ſaid) doth extend accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the growth of the <hi>Infant,</hi> and ſo enlargeth into a <hi>vaſt proportion.</hi> I have found it preſently after <hi>Delivery,</hi> of the bigneſs of ones <hi>head,</hi> and
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:56144:273"/>
thicker then the middlefingers breadth, and fraught with diverſe veſſels full of blood. It is indeed a wonderful thing, and (as <hi>Fabricius</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) doth much exceed our humane apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the ſo vaſt bulk of the <hi>Uterus</hi> ſhould ſo much leſſen, in ſo ſhort a ſpace, namely in the ſpace of fifteen, or twenty days.</p>
            <p>For no ſooner is the <hi>foetus</hi> and the <hi>After-burden excluded,</hi> but the <hi>Uterus</hi> doth by degrees gather it ſelf together, ſtreighteneth its <hi>Neck,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treateth it ſelf towards the <hi>interiour parts;</hi> being partly inſenſibly abated by a <hi>diaphoreſis,</hi> and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſſolved into the <hi>Purgations:</hi> and all the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering parts, the <hi>bones, belly,</hi> and all the <hi>Hypoga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrical region,</hi> are together contracted, and grow ſirme againe. In the Purgations, firſt of all <hi>pure blood,</hi> then <hi>corrupt blood,</hi> like that <hi>Water</hi> wherein <hi>fleſh</hi> that is newly killed is <hi>waſhed,</hi> and then <hi>paler blood</hi> doth iſſue forth: our women doe call it <hi>lact is proventum,</hi> the coming of the <hi>Milke,</hi> when their <hi>purgations</hi> are now no longer died with <hi>blood;</hi> becauſe perhaps, the <hi>Milk</hi> doth at that time flow more plenteous, and ſound for the Infant, from the breaſts; and the <hi>purgations</hi> do then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to diminiſh, and dry away: the <hi>alible juice</hi> being now tranſlated from the <hi>Uterus</hi> to the <hi>breaſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet other <hi>Animals</hi> do not require ſo great trouble in the buſineſs, for the fore-ſaid parts in them are, in the compaſs of a day or two, quite reſtored, and perfectly conſolidated. Nay ſome of them (as the <hi>Hare,</hi> and the <hi>Coney)</hi> in the ſpace of an hour after they have kindled, do admit the <hi>Buck,</hi> and are again <hi>fructified</hi> by <hi>Coition.</hi> As we have ſhewed that the <hi>Hen</hi> ſo ſoon as ever ſhe hath <hi>layed,</hi> is compreſſed by the <hi>Cock.</hi> But <hi>Women</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:56144:273"/>
as they onely have <hi>Termes,</hi> ſo do they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with <hi>after-purgings,</hi> and do alone under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe <hi>difficult</hi> and <hi>hazardous deliveries:</hi> becauſe their <hi>Uterus</hi> doth either unſeaſonably gather it ſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, by reaſon of weakneſs, or elſe the <hi>After-purgings</hi> are depraved contrary to nature, or do not come away kindly. For it often befalls <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> (eſpecially the more tender ſort) that the <hi>After-purgings</hi> being corrupted, and grown noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome within, do call in <hi>Feavers,</hi> and other grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous <hi>Symptomes.</hi> For the <hi>Womb</hi> being excoriated by the ſeparation of the <hi>After-burden</hi> (eſpecially if the ſeparation were violent) like a large in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Ulcer,</hi> is cleanſed and mundified by the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral <hi>emanations</hi> of the <hi>After-purgings.</hi> And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we conclude of the welfare or danger of a <hi>Woman in Child-bed,</hi> according to her <hi>excretions.</hi> If any part of the <hi>After-burden</hi> be left ſticking to the <hi>Uterus,</hi> the <hi>After-purgings</hi> will flow forth evil-ſented, green, and as if they proceeded from a dead body: and ſometimes the courage and ſtrength of the womb being quite vanquiſhed, a ſuddaine <hi>Gangrene</hi> doth induce a certain death.</p>
            <p>In caſe any <hi>Clotted Blood,</hi> or any other <hi>preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural matter,</hi> do remain in the <hi>cavity</hi> of the <hi>womb</hi> after the <hi>Delivery;</hi> the <hi>Womb</hi> will neither retire upwards, nor cloſe its <hi>Orifice,</hi> but its <hi>Neck</hi> will continue ſoft and open: As I have had experience in a <hi>Woman,</hi> which lying very ſick of a <hi>Malignant Feaver,</hi> and being very weak, did ſuffer an <hi>Abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> who after the excluſion of the <hi>Foetus;</hi> which was incorrupt and entire, yet lay exceeding weak with a diſorderly <hi>Pulſe,</hi> and in a <hi>cold ſweat,</hi> as if ſhe were a dying. I perceived the <hi>Orifice</hi> of her <hi>Womb</hi> was lax, ſoft, and very open, and her <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-purgings</hi> were ſomething noiſome: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:56144:274"/>
I ſuſpected that ſomething did lurke in her <hi>Womb</hi> which did putrefie: and putting in my hand, I extracted a <hi>falſe Conception,</hi> as bigge as a <hi>Gooſe-egge;</hi> which was made of a moſt <hi>thick, ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,</hi> and almoſt <hi>griſtly ſubſtance,</hi> having ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forations in it: (whereout did iſſue a viſcid and putrefied <hi>matter)</hi> and immediately upon this ſhe was diſcharged of thoſe greivous <hi>Symptomes,</hi> and ſuddainly after did perfectly recover.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Neck</hi> of the <hi>Womb</hi> doth a litle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract it ſelf, and thereupon the <hi>Clotted Blood</hi> doth get out, though not without pain and difficulty, cauſing thoſe paines, which our Midwives call the <hi>After-throws:</hi> the danger is then ſuppoſed to be over, and indeed it is uſually ſo; becauſe it is a ſigne of the ſtrength and firmneſs of the <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus,</hi> collecting it ſelf eaſily together; whereby the <hi>After-purgings</hi> are more readily expelled, and the <hi>Woman</hi> is the ſooner well.</p>
            <p>But I have known the <hi>Orifice</hi> of the <hi>Womb</hi> draw together ſo cloſe in ſome immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>delivery,</hi> that the <hi>Blood</hi> being deteined in the <hi>Womb,</hi> and thereupon ſuddenly putrefying and thickening into <hi>Clots,</hi> did induce moſt <hi>grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Symptomes;</hi> and when no means would availe to unburden them, a preſent death inſued.</p>
            <p>A very Honourable <hi>Lady</hi> in <hi>Child-bed</hi> falling into a <hi>feaver</hi> (by reaſon no <hi>After-purgings</hi> came from her) had her <hi>Privities</hi> ſwoln, and ſcortch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: the <hi>Orifice</hi> of her <hi>Matrix</hi> being hard, and ſhut up, I did open it a litle way by force with an <hi>Iron Inſtrument,</hi> that ſo I might immit an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> by a litle <hi>Syringe;</hi> whereupon black, clot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and noiſome <hi>blood</hi> did iſſue out, even to ſome certain pounds weight, whereby ſhe received pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent eaſe.</p>

The Wife of a <hi>Doctor of Divinity,</hi> who was of a <hi>good habit of Body</hi> enough, but being <hi>Barren,</hi> did conſult me; and being very deſirous of <hi>Children,</hi> ſhe had tried many Medicines, and Phyſicians, but all to no purpoſe: ſhe had her <hi>Termes</hi> at the uſual times; but ſometimes (eſpecially when ſhe had rod on Horſe-back) ſome corrupt and puru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>ſubſtance</hi> did iſſue from her: Which preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after would ſtop again. Some conceived it to be the <hi>Whites:</hi> others ſuſpected it to be ſome <hi>deep Ulcer:</hi> being perſwaded thereunto, chiefly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe her <hi>flux</hi> was not conſtant, and by litle and litle, but by certain <hi>Intervalls,</hi> and much at a time: Whereupon by the help of a <hi>Speculum Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricis</hi> they did ſurvey all the ſheath of the <hi>Uterus,</hi> and did apply ſeveral Medicines, but all in vain. At laſt I, being called, did open the inward <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> of the <hi>Womb,</hi> and preſently there did iſſue forth to the <hi>quantity</hi> of <hi>two ſpoonfulls,</hi> of corrupt <hi>matter,</hi> ſprinkled with <hi>bloody ſtreaks.</hi> Which when I perceived, I told them that there lay an <hi>Ulcer</hi> lurking in the <hi>cavity</hi> of her <hi>Womb;</hi> and by injecting proper Medicaments, I reſtored her to her former health. But being intent upon the cure, and ſeeing the ordinary remedies did litle availe, I applied more forcible ones; becauſe I ſuſpected that the <hi>Ulcer</hi> was inveterate (and perhaps with fleſh growing upon it) wherefore to my former injections, I added a litle <hi>Roman Vitriol;</hi> by whoſe acrimony the <hi>Uterus</hi> being extimulated, did grow ſo hard, that it did ſeem as hard to the touch as a <hi>Stone:</hi> and occaſioned ſeveral <hi>Hyſterical Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes</hi> withall; which Phyſitians commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to proceed from the <hi>ſuffocation</hi> of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix,</hi> and <hi>foul vapours</hi> being thence ſent upwards.

               <hi>Uterus</hi> being aſſwaged by milder applications, and ſuch as abate pains, did relax its <hi>Orifice</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and did exclude the <hi>ſharp liquour</hi> which I had injected, together with a putrid matter.

            <p>I conceived it convenient to transferre this <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory</hi> out of my <hi>Medicinal Obſervations,</hi> to this place, that it may evidently appear, of how ſharp and quick a ſenſe the <hi>Uterus</hi> is: and how eaſily it doth cloſe it ſelf upon the preſence of its adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary: eſpecially in a <hi>greivous</hi> and <hi>difficult Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in.</hi> Now theſe caſualties are moſt incident to <hi>Women</hi> above all other <hi>Creatures,</hi> and of them, to thoſe that are tenderly brought up, and doe lead a <hi>ſedentary</hi> and <hi>lazy life;</hi> as alſo to ſuch as are of a <hi>ſickly conſtitution,</hi> and do eaſily fall into diſtempers.</p>

There was a <hi>Woman</hi> bigge with Child, which followed her Husband, who was a Souldier in the Army; and the Army being daily in motion, was it ſeemes forced to make a Halt, by reaſon of a litle River that run croſs the place whether they intended to March: whereupon the poor woman finding her labour come upon her, retired to the next thicker, and alone by her ſelf, without any Midwife, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preparation, brought forth Twins: which ſhe preſently carried to the River, and there waſhed both her ſelf and them; which done, ſhe wrapt her Infants into a courſe cloath, and tied them to her back, and that very day, marched along with the Army twelve mile together, bare-footed: and was never the worſe for the matter.</p>
            <p>The next day after, the Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Lord <hi>Montioy</hi> (who at that time was <hi>General</hi> of the Army againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> at the ſiedge of <hi>Kingſale)</hi> and the <hi>Preſident</hi> of <hi>Munſter,</hi> being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected at the ſtrangeneſs of the ſtory, did both vouchſafe to be God-fathers to the Infants.</p>

               <hi>There are,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>three Membranes, two where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of do encompaſs the Infant throughout, but the third doth not. Of thoſe which do incompaſs the</hi> Foetus, <hi>one is the interiour, called</hi>

               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, id eſt, Inteſtinalis, <hi>the Gut-like Membrane, becauſe it is like a ſtuffed Gut, or Pudding: which therefore doth not encompaſs the</hi> Foetus, <hi>but lieth over part of the breaſt and lower bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and is extended to each horn of the</hi> Uterus. He doth confeſs that this <hi>Membrane</hi> is onely to be found in a <hi>Lamb,</hi> and a <hi>Calfe;</hi> and ſaith that it is joined to the <hi>Uterus,</hi> and doth by the <hi>Urachus</hi> receive the Urine of the <hi>foetus</hi> from the <hi>Bladder.</hi> And therefore, ſaith he, <hi>In Horned beaſts, which</hi> 
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>have this coat called</hi> Allantoides, <hi>the</hi> Urachus <hi>is ſo large, and ſtraite, that it reſembleth a Gut; grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by degrees leſſer and leſſer, even till it reach to the bottom of the bladder: which doth eaſily evince</hi>
               <pb n="511" facs="tcp:56144:276"/>
               <hi>that its original is rather from the</hi> Allantoides, <hi>then from the Bladder. But in a Man, and other Animals which have teeth in both Jawes, the fore-mentioned largeneſs of the</hi> Urachus <hi>is ſo ſmall, that whereas it riſeth ſingle from the bottom of the Bladder, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after divided into moſt ſlender fibers, which paſſing along with the Umbilical Veſſels, do transfund the Urine into the coat</hi> Chorion <hi>(in an almoſt invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible manner.)</hi> And upon this ground he doth challenge <hi>Arantius</hi> of a double errour; both in that he denyed any <hi>Urachus</hi> to be found in a <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane foetus;</hi> and likewiſe for ſaying, that it doth diſcharge its Urine through its <hi>privy member.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for my part, I confeſs my ſelf to be invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the ſame errours with <hi>Arantius</hi> (if at leaſt they be errours.) For I am ſure of this, that if you compreſs the <hi>bladder</hi> of a large-grown <hi>foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> (be it the <hi>humane foetus,</hi> or of any other <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal)</hi> the Urine will ſtart out at the <hi>Privities.</hi> But as for the <hi>Urachus,</hi> I never yet ſaw any ſuch thing, nor could ever obſerve that upon compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>bladder,</hi> the Urine would guſh out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Secundines.</hi> I have indeed in <hi>Sheep</hi> and <hi>Deer,</hi> ſeen a certain <hi>Proceſs</hi> of the <hi>bladder,</hi> which doth contain Urine in it; but never ſaw any ſuch as the <hi>Urachus</hi> by him deſcribed.</p>
            <p>And yet I will not too ſtiffly deny, that there is a <hi>Coat</hi> called <hi>Allantoides;</hi> for the <hi>Interiour mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes</hi> are ſo thin and tranſparent, (ſuch as wee have ſignified to be found between the two <hi>whites</hi> of an <hi>Egg)</hi> that they may eaſily impoſe upon the <hi>Eye.</hi> Likewiſe in a <hi>Hen-egg,</hi> between the <hi>Colliqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum</hi> and the <hi>White</hi> (that is, between the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> and the <hi>Chorion)</hi> there is to be ſeen ſome <hi>whitiſh excrements,</hi> nay, ſometimes the very <hi>down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right excrements</hi> of the Guts; as we have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:56144:277"/>
ſpoken, and <hi>Coiterus</hi> hath alſo obſerved. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the <hi>Membrane</hi> of the <hi>Colliquamentum</hi> it ſelf (wherein the <hi>Chicken</hi> doth ſwim) though it be pellucid, thin, and ſo ſubtle, that (according to <hi>Fabricius</hi> his own confeſſion) thinner cannot be imagined: yet (ſince according to <hi>Him,</hi> all the <hi>membranes</hi> though never ſo thin, are nevertheleſs double) Nature may poſſibly ſometimes upon neceſſity depoſit the Urine, or ſome other <hi>excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> between the <hi>Reduplications</hi> or <hi>folds</hi> thereof. And ſuch a kinde of <hi>Allantoides</hi> as this, I ſhall willingly indulge to <hi>Fabricius:</hi> but as for any other kinde of <hi>Pudding,</hi> carried on to both the <hi>bornes</hi> of the Womb, I finde no ſuch thing in the <hi>Secundines of Cloven-footed-beaſts,</hi> nor any thing elſe, but the <hi>Conception</hi> it ſelf. I onely finde, (as I have ſaid before) a kinde of <hi>Proceſs</hi> of the <hi>blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> which being ſeated between the <hi>Umbilical Arteries,</hi> doth contain an <hi>excrementitious humour,</hi> and this Proceſs is in ſome longer, and in others ſhorter.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, in my judgment, the <hi>Coat</hi> which <hi>Fabricius</hi> calls <hi>Allantoides,</hi> is the meer <hi>Chorion:</hi> and yet the <hi>Antients</hi> called it <hi>Allantoides,</hi> from the <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure</hi> of a <hi>double-pudding,</hi> which it doth reſemble. For the <hi>exteriour membrane,</hi> which (like a <hi>Wallet</hi> tyed in the middle) is extended to the <hi>extremities</hi> of each <hi>Horn;</hi> and paſſing through the interpoſed <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Uterus</hi> (or the connexion of both the <hi>Horns)</hi> is faſtened together, is the <hi>Chorion;</hi> which, in <hi>Sheep, Goats, Hinds,</hi> and <hi>Does,</hi> and other <hi>cloven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed beaſts,</hi> if you take it in your hand in the middle of that paſſage, you may draw it away entire: and this we have called their <hi>Egge,</hi> or <hi>Conception.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For it containeth as an <hi>Egge</hi> doth, a two-fold
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:56144:277"/>
               <hi>liquor,</hi> a <hi>foetus,</hi> and all things relating thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; and hath the ſame qualifications which <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> aſſigneth to an <hi>Egge;</hi> namely, that out of <hi>part</hi> thereof an <hi>Animal</hi> ought to be conſtituted, and that the <hi>remainder</hi> ought to become the <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> and <hi>ſuſtenance</hi> of that <hi>Animal,</hi> when it is now conſtituted.</p>
            <p>And therefore that <hi>Coat</hi> which <hi>Fabricius</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <hi>Allantoides,</hi> I either conceive to be the <hi>Choriou,</hi> or that ſomething praeter-natural had befalne ſome <hi>Animal</hi> which he had ſeen. For certain it is, that it is onely to be found in ſome few <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,</hi> and not alwaies in them neither: for at the Beginning it is not found, &amp; afterwards, in ſome it is more, and in others leſs conſpicuous, and in ſome nothing at all is diſcernable, but meerly a <hi>Proceſs.</hi> And <hi>Fabricius</hi> himſelf conceiveth it not uſefull to the encompaſſing of the <hi>Infant,</hi> but only to the <hi>reception</hi> of the <hi>Urine.</hi> And truly I believe, that he maketh mention of it, rather in juſtification of the Doctrine of the <hi>Antients,</hi> then that himſelf found any ſuch thing, or thought it uſefull to any intent. But (both with the <hi>Antients,</hi> and the <hi>whole School</hi> of <hi>Phyſitians)</hi> he doth confeſs, that the <hi>Chorion</hi> doth contain Urine; where hee ſaith, that <hi>two humours</hi> are about the <hi>foetus,</hi> the one being <hi>Sweat,</hi> which is in the <hi>Amnion,</hi> the other <hi>Urine,</hi> which is contained in the <hi>Chorion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which it is manifeſt, that the <hi>Antients</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood one &amp; the ſame <hi>membrane</hi> under a double compellation; namely, in <hi>cloven-footed beaſts,</hi> (in whom alone it is found) they called it <hi>Allan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toides,</hi> by reaſon of its <hi>figure:</hi> but in other <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,</hi> they called it <hi>Chorion,</hi> from its <hi>emploiment,</hi> becauſe they conceived it was deſigned for the entertainment of the Urine. And therefore they
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:56144:278"/>
confeſs that this <hi>Coat</hi> is neither found in a <hi>Man,</hi> nor any other <hi>Animals.</hi> For what need of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Coat</hi> to entertain the Urine, when that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, by their own confeſſion, is already executed by the <hi>Chorion?</hi> And indeed, there can no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable reaſon be alledged why that <hi>coat</hi> ſhould be found in <hi>Sheep, Goats,</hi> and other <hi>beaſts</hi> which cleave the <hi>hoof,</hi> and not alſo in <hi>Dogs, Cats, Mice,</hi> and <hi>Others.</hi> For if it were inſtituted for the rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the Urine, it is neceſſary, that the <hi>foetus</hi> of <hi>Sheep,</hi> and <hi>Cowes,</hi> ſhould either abound with greater plenty of Urine then other <hi>animals</hi> which have <hi>Teeth</hi> in both <hi>Jawes;</hi> or elſe, that there are three diverſe kindes of <hi>humours;</hi> or at leaſt two Receptacles of the <hi>Urine.</hi> For this I am ſure, that the <hi>Chorion</hi> is from the firſt beginning full of <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> But I do not here intend to diſpute contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, I ſhall rather rehearſe what I have found by experience.</p>
            <p>It is one thing to exhibit the <hi>fabrick</hi> of a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,</hi> or <hi>Embryo</hi> that is now perfected, as <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricius</hi> doth: but another thing, to diſcloſe the the <hi>generation</hi> thereof, and firſt <hi>ſcheme</hi> and <hi>rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of all: as it is a diverſe buſineſs to deſcribe <hi>Apples,</hi> or the <hi>ripe ſeeds</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> and their firſt <hi>production</hi> from the <hi>bud.</hi> We therefore will brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relate, how the <hi>Conception</hi> is <hi>framed</hi> by litle and litle, even from the <hi>beginning</hi> to the <hi>end;</hi> that it may thence more likely appear, what we are to conclude concerning the <hi>Membranes,</hi> and other <hi>Appurtenances</hi> relating to the <hi>Foetus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All Living things do derive their <hi>Original</hi> (as we have ſaid) from ſomething, which doth contain in it both the <hi>matter,</hi> and <hi>efficient virtue</hi> and <hi>power:</hi> which therefore is that thing, both <hi>out of which,</hi> and <hi>by which,</hi> whatſoever is born, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:56144:278"/>
its <hi>beginning.</hi> And ſuch an <hi>Original</hi> or <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment</hi> in <hi>Animals</hi> (whether they proceed from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Animals</hi> which do beget them, or elſe are <hi>ſpontaneous,</hi> and the Iſſues of <hi>Putrefaction)</hi> is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>humour,</hi> which is concluded in ſome certain <hi>coat,</hi> or <hi>ſhell;</hi> namely, a <hi>ſimilar body,</hi> having life actually in it, or <hi>in potentiâ:</hi> and this, in caſe it be generated within an <hi>Animal,</hi> and do there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, untill it have produced an <hi>Vnivocal Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,</hi> is commonly called a <hi>Conception:</hi> but if it be expoſed without, by being born, or elſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume its beginning elſewhere, it is called either an <hi>Egg,</hi> or a <hi>Worm.</hi> But I conceive that both ought alike to be called <hi>Primordium,</hi> the firſt <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment</hi> from which an <hi>Animal</hi> doth ſpring; as <hi>Plants</hi> aſſume their nativity from the <hi>Seed:</hi> and all theſe <hi>Primordia</hi> are of one <hi>kinde,</hi> namely, <hi>Vital.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this kinde of <hi>Rudiment</hi> I finde in the <hi>Vte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> of all <hi>Viviparous Animals,</hi> before any part of the <hi>foetus</hi> appear; namely, there is a <hi>cleare, ſtiffe, white humour</hi> (like the <hi>white</hi> of an <hi>Egge)</hi> which is included in a <hi>membrane,</hi> which I call their <hi>egge:</hi> and this doth fill up all the <hi>Vterus,</hi> and both the <hi>Horns</hi> thereof, in <hi>Hindes, Does, Sheep,</hi> and other Beaſts which cleave the Hoof.</p>
            <p>In proceſs of <hi>Time,</hi> there is a moſt pure, and clear <hi>watry part diſtinguiſhed</hi> or <hi>ſevered from the reſt of the Rudiment, or egge,</hi> which we call the <hi>Colliquamentum,</hi> or <hi>diſſolved part</hi> in a <hi>Hen-egge)</hi> and this doth in brightneſs or perſpicuity farre exceed all the reſt of the <hi>egge</hi> (in which it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended. The form thereof is <hi>round,</hi> and it is concluded in its <hi>own proper membrane,</hi> which is moſt thin and tranſparent, which they call <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;</hi> as for the reſt of the <hi>humor,</hi> which is thicker and darker then this, an <hi>exteriour coat,</hi> which is
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:56144:279"/>
contiguous to the <hi>concave ſuperficies</hi> of the <hi>Vterus,</hi> and embraceth the <hi>whole Egge,</hi> doth contain it: which obtaineth a ſeveral <hi>figure,</hi> according to the diverſity of the <hi>ſhape</hi> of the <hi>womb:</hi> for in ſome it is <hi>oval,</hi> in other <hi>oblong,</hi> but in <hi>Beaſts</hi> which cleave the <hi>hoof,</hi> it reſembleth a <hi>Wallet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A litle while after, there doth appear in this cryſtal <hi>Colliquamentum, Punctum rubrum ſaliens,</hi> A Red leaping Point; from which moſt ſlender ſtrings of <hi>litle Veines</hi> are <hi>diſſeminated,</hi> like <hi>rayes</hi> or <hi>beames.</hi> Anon the firſt <hi>concrement</hi> or <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the Body doth appear, like a <hi>Magot,</hi> which is bent like a <hi>Keel</hi> of a <hi>Ship:</hi> and ſo the reſt of the Parts doe follow in their order, as hath been related in our <hi>Hiſtory.</hi> For we have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the Procreation of the <hi>foetus</hi> in <hi>Viviparous Animals</hi> is inſtituted in the ſame manner out of the <hi>Egg</hi> or <hi>Conception,</hi> as the <hi>Chicken</hi> out of the <hi>Henn-Egg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But theſe <hi>Viviparous conceptions</hi> do (as I have noted) differ in Figure, Number, and Connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the <hi>Vterus.</hi> For at the beginning, the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception</hi> (eſpecially in thoſe that cleave the <hi>hoofe)</hi> doth not grow to the <hi>Vterus;</hi> but being onely contiguous thereunto, doth fill up all its <hi>cavity,</hi> and diſtend it, and may be eaſily drawn out whole.</p>
            <p>In ſuch Creatures as cleave the <hi>hoofe,</hi> (which do conceive in the <hi>Horns</hi> of the <hi>Womb)</hi> and alſo in thoſe that are <hi>whole-hoofed,</hi> there is onely one of theſe <hi>eggs</hi> found at a time, and that alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it ſelfe to both the <hi>Hornes,</hi> and though ſometimes they do produce a <hi>ſingle,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a <hi>double foetus;</hi> and thereupon have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one <hi>ſingle Colliquamentum,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>two</hi> (namely, one in the <hi>Right,</hi> and another in
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:56144:279"/>
the <hi>Left Horn)</hi> yet are they ſtill concluded in that <hi>Common Egg</hi> or <hi>Conception.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in other <hi>Animals,</hi> ſo many <hi>foetus,</hi> ſo many <hi>ſeveral Eggs</hi> are to be ſeen apart; and as many <hi>Colliquamentums</hi> in them, as it is in the <hi>Dog,</hi> the <hi>Cat,</hi> the <hi>Mouſe,</hi> and ſuch like <hi>Animals</hi> as have <hi>teeth</hi> in both their Jawes.</p>
            <p>The Figure of the <hi>Conception</hi> in ſuch as cleave the <hi>hoof,</hi> is like a <hi>Wallet;</hi> namely ſuch, as <hi>Fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> doth attribute to the <hi>Allantoides.</hi> In a <hi>Mare,</hi> the internal ſhape of the <hi>womb</hi> reſembleth a litle <hi>oblong Sack;</hi> but in a <hi>Woman,</hi> it is <hi>Orbicular.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In thoſe <hi>Animals,</hi> whoſe <hi>conception</hi> doth cleave to their <hi>womb</hi> (which, truly, is not ſo in many, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the <hi>foetus</hi> be fully formed) it is diſtinguiſhed by its Diverſity of <hi>Connexion:</hi> for in ſome, it doth ſtick onely in one place, by the mediation of a <hi>carnous ſubſtance,</hi> which we call <hi>Placenta,</hi> the <hi>Ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine cake</hi> in <hi>women,</hi> becauſe it reſembleth the <hi>round figure</hi> of a Cake; but in others, it groweth to the <hi>Uterus</hi> in ſeveral places, being faſtened thereunto by divers <hi>fleſhy ſubſtances,</hi> or <hi>caruncles:</hi> namely, by <hi>five,</hi> in <hi>Hindes,</hi> and <hi>Does;</hi> by more in <hi>Cowes,</hi> but they are leſſer alſo: but in the race of <hi>Sheep,</hi> by very many, and thoſe of different magnitude. In <hi>Dogs</hi> and <hi>Cats,</hi> theſe Carnous Bodies, do (like a girdle) encompaſs every <hi>conception</hi> round. A like ſubſtance doth in <hi>Hares,</hi> and <hi>Moles,</hi> grow to the ſides of their <hi>Uterus:</hi> as alſo the <hi>Uterine cake</hi> in a <hi>woman,</hi> which embraceth more then one half of the <hi>conception</hi> (as the cups do the <hi>Acorns,</hi> when they firſt ſpring) and therefore the <hi>gibbous part</hi> thereof doth ſtick faſt to the <hi>womb,</hi> but the <hi>hollow part</hi> doth grow to the <hi>Chorion.</hi>

            <p>But as for what he relateth concerning the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, <note place="margin">Of the Humours.</note> which as he ſuppoſeth he doth receive from the Ancients (as a thing moſt ſure, and which ſtandeth in no need of any proof) namely, that the water in the <hi>Amnion,</hi> wherein the <hi>foetus</hi> ſwimmes, is its ſweat; and that that outward <hi>Water</hi> in the <hi>Chorion</hi> is the <hi>Vrine,</hi> are both incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous, and falſe aſſertions: For both thoſe two <hi>humours</hi> do appear in the conception before any portion of the <hi>foetus</hi> it ſelf be in being: and that which he calleth the Urine, is before that (which they conceive to be the <hi>ſweat.)</hi> Nay you may find theſe humours, eſpecially the laſt, in ſome <hi>barren,</hi> and <hi>unfruitful conceptions</hi> (wherein there is no tract of a <hi>foetus</hi> at all.)</p>

For thoſe creatures which do breed an Animal within themſelves, have in ſome ſort after their firſt conception, ſomething like an egge within them, for a humour is conteined in a thin membrane, juſt as if you ſhould pluck the ſhell off of the egge.</hi> But as for that <hi>humour</hi> conteined in the <hi>Chorion,</hi> which
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:56144:280"/>
               <hi>Fabricius</hi> and other Phyſitians conceive to be the <hi>Urine, Ariſtotle</hi> ſeemeth to apprehend it to be the <hi>liquour</hi> of the <hi>Sperme,</hi> or <hi>Geniture.</hi> For, he ſaith, <note place="margin">

               <hi>The ſeed being received by the</hi> Uterus, <hi>having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in it a while, is covered with a membrane. For if it chance to fall out, before any dearticulation, or delineation of the parts do appear, it looketh like an egge covered with a membrane, when the ſhell is pilled off. But that membrane is full of Veins,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>Chorion,</hi> which hath aſſumed its <hi>denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation a venarum choro, ſive copia,</hi> from the conflux or multitude of veins.</p>
            <p>I have often ſeen thoſe kind of <hi>egges ejected</hi> in the ſecond, or third moneth: they are many times corrupt and rotten within, and do ſteale out inſenſibly (like the <hi>Whites)</hi> and ſo delude thoſe, who have entertained hopes of a true <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, thoſe fore-mentioned <hi>humours</hi> cannot be conceived to be <hi>ſweat,</hi> or <hi>Urine:</hi> becauſe they abound in ſuch plenty at the very <hi>beginning,</hi> that the <hi>Embryo</hi> ſwimming in the middeſt thereof, is thereby ſecured (whileſt his Mother runneth, or danceth, or doth imply her body by any forcible agitation) from the <hi>colliſion</hi> of the <hi>circumjacent parts,</hi> as it were by a fortreſs.</p>
            <p>Add to all this, that many <hi>Animals</hi> never ſweat at all: (when yet according to <hi>Ariſtotle, all Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Land, and Volatile Animals,</hi> and I ſhall put in <hi>creeping things,</hi> and <hi>Inſects</hi> alſo, <hi>whether they be produced in the ſhape of an egge, or an Animal,</hi> or elſe be ſpontaneous productions, <hi>are all procreated after a like manner)</hi> all <hi>fowl, creeping things,</hi> and <hi>fiſhes,</hi> are conceived neither to Sweat, nor Urine. <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> The <hi>Dog,</hi> and <hi>Cat,</hi> do never ſweat; nor any other <hi>Animal,</hi> while it doth emit abundance of Urine.
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:56144:281"/>
And certainly it is impoſſible, that any <hi>Animal</hi> ſhould make <hi>water,</hi> before the <hi>Reines</hi> and <hi>Bladder</hi> are made.</p>
            <p>Beſides, which is a more evincing Argument then the reſt, theſe <hi>humours</hi> cannot be <hi>excrementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,</hi> becauſe ſo many litle <hi>filaments</hi> of <hi>Veins</hi> are diſſeminated into them: which doe derive <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> from thence (as from a large ſtock) and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards conduct it unto the <hi>foetus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, if the humour conteined in the <hi>Chorion,</hi> be the Urine; what need is there of the <hi>Allantoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des?</hi> and if the humour conteined in the <hi>Amnion</hi> be the <hi>Sweat,</hi> why did nature, who is ſo exact in all her contrivances, order the matter ſo ill, as to condemn the <hi>foetus</hi> to lye wallowing in its own <hi>Excrement?</hi> and why doth the <hi>Parent</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after delivery (for that is uſual with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral creatures) devour that which is but the <hi>Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of her <hi>foetus,</hi> together with the <hi>membranes</hi> which contein it, with ſo much greedineſs and appetite? Some have obſerved, that if the <hi>Animal</hi> do not eat up theſe <hi>membranes</hi> and <hi>humours,</hi> it will not give down its <hi>Milk</hi> freely.</p>
            <p>If, notwithſtanding all theſe arguments, ſome men will ſtill maintain that theſe <hi>humours</hi> (which we diſpoſe to the nutriment of the <hi>foetus)</hi> are <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious;</hi> and that upon this inducement, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they alſo improve according to the growth of the <hi>foetus:</hi> and that in the birth of ſome <hi>Animals</hi> (at which time the whole ſtock of <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is in probability almoſt conſumed) great ſtore of theſe <hi>humours</hi> doth abound; and that therefore they muſt needs performe other offices, then can well conſiſt with the dignity of the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment. Yet for all this, I confidently pronounce, that theſe <hi>humours</hi> are the <hi>Aliment</hi> of the <hi>foetus</hi>
               <pb n="521" facs="tcp:56144:281"/>
from the beginning of all; (as the <hi>Colliquamentum</hi> and the <hi>White</hi> do ſerve the <hi>Chicken</hi> for the ſame purpoſe) but in proceſs of time, the thinner, and purer parts being exhauſted, the reliques do then put on the nature of an <hi>uſeful excrement:</hi> and are reſerved in ſome <hi>Animals,</hi> that ſo they may ſecure the <hi>foetus</hi> and facilitate the <hi>delivery.</hi> For as <hi>Wine,</hi> when the <hi>Spirits</hi> are exhaled, turnes into <hi>dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine:</hi> and as ſeveral <hi>Excrements</hi> do reſult from the <hi>reliques</hi> of the <hi>Aliment:</hi> ſo in like manner, when all that <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> which is commodious to the <hi>ſuſtenance</hi> of the <hi>foetus,</hi> is derived out of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour concluded in the <hi>Chorion;</hi> the remainder doth turn into a kind of <hi>excrement,</hi> and is reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the <hi>uſes</hi> aforeſaid. But all that humour which was included in the <hi>Amnion,</hi> it common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpent neer the approaching delivery; ſo that it is probable, that the <hi>foetus</hi> deſireth to get out by reaſon his proviſions faile him.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, if at any time there be any other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour conteined in the <hi>Allantoides</hi> (as indeed there ſometimes is) I eſteem it to be a <hi>preter-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural humour.</hi> For I have ſeen when women at their <hi>delivery</hi> have had a mighty flux of water; and ſometimes a two-fold water: our Midwives call them the <hi>By-waters.</hi> And therefore ſome women have a monſtrous <hi>great belly,</hi> though they are brought to bed of a very litle &amp; lean Childe; but ſuch women do effund abundance of <hi>Waters.</hi> Some are of opinion, that the larger quantity of <hi>Waters,</hi> doth accompany weakly, and thoſe <hi>fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Children:</hi> but the leſſer, ſtrong, and <hi>male Children.</hi> I have often ſeen waters burſt forth in the midſt of the going with Child without Abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Child remaining ſafe, and ſtrong even to the birth. As therefore there are naturally
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:56144:282"/>
but two <hi>Waters</hi> only, (whereof the one is contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the <hi>Chorion,</hi> and the other in the <hi>Amnion)</hi> ſo it may ſometimes fall out, beſide the ordinary courſe of nature, that ſeveral <hi>Waters</hi> may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulated in <hi>membranes</hi> proper to themſelves, or elſe in the reduplications of the <hi>Chorion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Membranes</hi> or <hi>Coats</hi> of the <hi>Womb,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes.</note> ſince their proper uſe and office chiefly is, to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein the Waters;</hi> and thoſe <hi>Waters</hi> appear to be two only; it is moſt certain that the membranes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are not (neceſſary and uſually) more then two.</p>
            <p>But as for thoſe who reckon three, I conceive they were deluded, becauſe the Ancients call the ſelf-ſame <hi>membrane</hi> ſometimes <hi>Chorion,</hi> from the <hi>conflux of Veines;</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Allantoides,</hi> from its <hi>figure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every conception is covered over with theſe two membranes; as alſo every <hi>Braine</hi> hath a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Meninx:</hi> every <hi>Tree</hi> and <hi>Shrub</hi> a two-fold <hi>Bark;</hi> every <hi>Seed</hi> and <hi>Fruit</hi> a two-fold <hi>Covering:</hi> whereof the Exteriour is the harder, and tighter.</p>
            <p>The more Interiour of the two fore-mentioned <hi>membranes</hi> (conteining the <hi>Colliquamentum,</hi> or purer <hi>humour)</hi> is the thinneſt, and is called <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> that is, <hi>Amiculum,</hi> the litle covering, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it covereth and involveth the <hi>foetus.</hi> The Exteriour (which is by much the larger, and ſtronger membrane) is called <hi>Chorion,</hi> becauſe (ſaith <hi>Fabricius) many Veins, and Arteries are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in it,</hi> tanquam in Choro, <hi>as in a Quire. And hence the Coat of the Eye, and likewiſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture of Veins and Arteries which is found in the Ventricles of the Brain, are both called</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>from the reſemblance they have with theſe veines in the</hi> Chorion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="523" facs="tcp:56144:282"/>
This <hi>Membrane Chorion</hi> doth fill all the <hi>Womb;</hi> conteining a ſtiffe, troubled humour; and to its exteriour part, the <hi>Vterine Cake</hi> or <hi>Caruncles</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering, do faſten the <hi>Conception</hi> to the <hi>Womb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Interiour part</hi> of this <hi>Membrane</hi> (in a <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man)</hi> is almoſt conjoined to the <hi>Amnion,</hi> nor is it eaſily ſeparated from it. In thoſe <hi>Animals</hi> which <hi>cleave the hoofe</hi> it is exceeding large, and conteineth a hundred-fold more moiſture in it, then the <hi>Amnion.</hi> For the <hi>Amnion</hi> at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, is ſcarce ſo large as a <hi>Nutmeg,</hi> or fair <hi>Bean,</hi> and is commonly found in one <hi>Horn</hi> of the <hi>womb</hi> onely, namely in that where the <hi>Foetus</hi> inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Coat Chorion</hi> is (chiefly in <hi>Women)</hi> rough, and viſcous without; but within ſmooth, and glibbe, and interwoven with abundance of <hi>Veins.</hi> The upper part of it is (in Women) thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſofter, but the lower part, thinner and more membranous.</p>
            <p>In women the <hi>After-burden</hi> groweth to the <hi>upper part</hi> of this <hi>membrane:</hi> But in <hi>Sheep,</hi> ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Caruncles</hi> are faſtened to ſeveral parts of it. In <hi>Hinds,</hi> and <hi>Does,</hi> the conception doth cling to the <hi>Vterus</hi> at <hi>five places</hi> onely: but in a <hi>Mare</hi> it doth adhere to the <hi>Vterus</hi> in an infinite company of places.

which do derive <hi>nutriment</hi> from the <hi>womb</hi> to the <hi>foetus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now, this <hi>fleſhy Subſtance</hi> neither is in all Animals, nor at all times in thoſe in whom it is: but in thoſe Animals onely in whom the <hi>conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption</hi> doth <hi>firmly</hi> cleave to the womb, and then onely, when it is faſtened to the womb to bring down ſuſtenance to the <hi>foetus.</hi> For in the <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> the <hi>conception</hi> (like an <hi>egge</hi> ſeated in the womb) is contiguous to all the circum-jacent parts of the <hi>Uterus,</hi> but doth on no ſide grow thereunto; but doth produce its <hi>foetus</hi> (as it is in an <hi>Egge</hi> which is ſat upon by the <hi>Henne)</hi> out of the <hi>Humours</hi> contained in it: but that <hi>adhaeſion</hi> and cleaving to the <hi>womb,</hi> is then firſt of all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, and alſo this <hi>fleſhy body</hi> is then firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be <hi>generated</hi> (which <hi>fleſhy ſubſtance</hi> is the Tye of the <hi>Conception</hi> to the <hi>womb)</hi> when the <hi>foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> is now perfectly <hi>formed,</hi> and ſtanding in need of other, and more plentifull ſupply of Aliment, doth diſpatch the Extremities of the <hi>Umbilical veſſels</hi> to the <hi>Uterus,</hi> as Emiſſaries or Agents, that may from thence (as the <hi>Roots</hi> to <hi>Plants)</hi> convey proviſions. For in the <hi>beginning,</hi> (as we have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) when the <hi>Punctum ſaliens,</hi> and the <hi>Blood</hi> doe onely appear, the Propagations of the <hi>Vmbilical veſsels</hi> are onely <hi>diſseminated</hi> through the <hi>Colliqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum,</hi> and the <hi>Coat Amnion.</hi> But when once the <hi>fabrick</hi> of the Body is ſet up, thoſe Propagations do conduct themſelves farther, and being grown more numerous, are <hi>divaricated</hi> in the <hi>Chorion</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that ſo they may tranſport <hi>ſuſtenance</hi> from thence to the <hi>foetus,</hi> out of the <hi>whitiſh humour</hi> which reſideth there.</p>
            <p>By which it appeareth, that the <hi>foetus</hi> of <hi>Vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parous Animals</hi> is at the <hi>beginning</hi> fed in the ſame
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:56144:283"/>
manner, as the Chicken is ſuſtained in the <hi>egge;</hi> and doth for that cauſe abide in the <hi>Vterus,</hi> that at length (when it hath no longer a ſupply from its own ſtock) it may, by the mediation of the <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runcles</hi> grow to the <hi>Vterus;</hi> and be more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſupported, by the contribution of its <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore <hi>Fabricius</hi> did rightly obſerve, that the <hi>conception</hi> was in ſome Animals ſcarce faſtened to the <hi>Vterus</hi> at all. And therefore <hi>Sowes,</hi> and <hi>Mares,</hi> have none of this <hi>carnous</hi> connexion; but their <hi>egge</hi> or <hi>conception,</hi> as it is firſt of all conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the <hi>moiſture</hi> or <hi>juices</hi> which do flow in the <hi>Vterus,</hi> (as the <hi>Egge</hi> in the <hi>Hen</hi> is enlarged by the <hi>White,</hi> without any tye to the <hi>Vterus)</hi> ſo doth it alſo receive Augmentation; and the <hi>foetus</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, having Aliment adminiſtred to him from the <hi>conception,</hi> (wherein he is contained) is in the ſame manner ſupported, as the <hi>egge</hi> out of the <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors.</hi> Whence a notable argument doth reſult, that the <hi>Foetus</hi> of thoſe <hi>Animals</hi> is no more nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by the <hi>Mothers blood,</hi> then the Chicken in the <hi>egge:</hi> and that the <hi>Humour</hi> comprehended in the <hi>Chorion,</hi> is neither Urine, nor any other Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the Aliment of the <hi>Foetus.</hi> Although (as we have obſerved before) when the <hi>alible juice</hi> is exhauſted, the <hi>remainder</hi> thereof doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate into an <hi>Excrement,</hi> like to the Urine. And this alſo is evident, from that which we have formerly noted, concerning the <hi>Cotyledones;</hi> namely, that the <hi>fleſhy ſubſtance</hi> is in thoſe Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals of a <hi>ſpongy ſubſtance,</hi> and doth (like a <hi>Hony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb)</hi> conſiſt of innumerable <hi>acetabula, holes</hi> or <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifices,</hi> which are all of them full of a <hi>mucous white matter;</hi> (which <hi>Galen</hi> alſo records to be ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerved) and that thence the Extremities of
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:56144:284"/>
the <hi>Vmbilical veſsels</hi> do ſuck Nutriment, which they tranſport to the <hi>foetus;</hi> as the ſmall <hi>branches</hi> of the <hi>Meſenterical veines</hi> do, in thoſe Animals which are already born, derive <hi>chyle</hi> out of the <hi>coats</hi> of the Guts, through which they are diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
            <p>I therefore apprehend the imployment of the <hi>Vterine cake</hi> and the <hi>caruncles,</hi> to be ſuch as is commonly imputed to the <hi>Liver</hi> and the <hi>Breaſts.</hi> For the <hi>Liver</hi> doth adde a preparation to the <hi>chyle</hi> which is attracted from the Guts, fitting the ſame for the ſuſtenance of the Body; and likewiſe the <hi>Vterine cake</hi> doth afreſh concoct the <hi>alible nutriment</hi> which proceedeth from the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,</hi> to ſupport the <hi>foetus.</hi> The <hi>Breaſts</hi> alſo (being compoſed of a <hi>glandulous ſubſtance)</hi> do ſtrut with <hi>milk;</hi> and though they are parts which (in ſome <hi>Animals)</hi> do not appear at all, yet at the time of <hi>pregnation</hi> they are ſeen to be full, and tumorous: ſo the <hi>Vterine cake,</hi> being a <hi>laxe</hi> or <hi>flaggy</hi> and <hi>fungous ſubſtance,</hi> both flow with a whitiſh ſap, and is never found but at the time of <hi>Ingravida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The <hi>Liver,</hi> I ſay, is the nutritive <hi>inſtrument</hi> of the Body wherein it is; the <hi>Breaſts</hi> of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant,</hi> and the <hi>Placenta</hi> of the <hi>Embryo.</hi> And as the <hi>mother</hi> doth by her own <hi>food</hi> acquire more <hi>milke</hi> then ſhe hath uſe for to ſuſtain her <hi>fleſh,</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> which <hi>milk</hi> is reconcocted in her <hi>breaſts,</hi> and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured up; ſo alſo ſuch Females as are great with <hi>young</hi> (in whoſe <hi>womb</hi> this <hi>Placenta</hi> is) do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, and ſuppeditate to their <hi>foetus</hi> an aliment which is defecated by thoſe <hi>caruncles:</hi> by which it cometh to paſs, that an impure or laudible diet is adminiſtred to the <hi>Embryo's,</hi> according as the <hi>Parents diet</hi> it ſelf is either wholſome or impure, and according to the ſufficient or imperfect <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction,</hi>
               <pb n="527" facs="tcp:56144:284"/>
which they afford it in thoſe <hi>organs</hi> of the <hi>Vterus.</hi> For ſome <hi>Embryo's</hi> have a more perfect <hi>organ</hi> provided for them, ſuch as is that <hi>carnous ſubſtance</hi> of the <hi>Uterus,</hi> which is wanting in ſome.

Women have one onely;</hi> as <hi>Mice, Conies, Ginny-pigs, Bitches, Cats,</hi> and ſeveral <hi>Animals,</hi> whoſe <hi>feet</hi> are diſtinguiſhed into <hi>toes,</hi> and have <hi>teeth</hi> in both <hi>jawes: but all Animals which cleave the hoof, and have teeth in one jaw onely, whether they be dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, as the Sheep, the Cow, and the Goat; or wilde, as the Hinde, the Doe, the Roe, and the like, have diverſe. Again, thoſe Animals which have but one, in them it either reſembleth a Cake</hi> (and thence cometh its denomination) <hi>as in Women, Conies, the Hare, and the Mole, Mice, and Ginney-pigs: or elſe it reſembleth a zone or girdle, or ſwath ingirting the trunck of the body, as in Bitches, Cats, Ferrets,</hi> and the like. In ſome it is like a <hi>chalice,</hi> or <hi>Acorn cup,</hi> comprehending the greater part of the <hi>foetus</hi> (as in the <hi>Hare</hi> and the <hi>Cony:)</hi> where the <hi>convexe</hi>
               <pb n="528" facs="tcp:56144:285"/>
               <hi>part</hi> groweth to the <hi>Vterus,</hi> and the <hi>concavous</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the <hi>foetus. Likewiſe in thoſe females which have but one, and that reſembling a Cake, though the figure be alike in them all, yet the ſcituation is unlike. For in a woman it groweth to the bottom of the womb, and is diſtant a great way, that is by the length of long veſsels from the</hi> foetus: <hi>but in Mice, Ginny-pigs, and Conies, it is annexed partly to the Region of the Loynes, partly to the ſides of the breaſt. But thoſe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals which have more of theſe carnous ſubſtances then one, they are all of them furniſhed with teeth in one jaw onely, as Sheep, Cowes, Hinds, Roe-deer, and the like, and yet in theſe alſo there is a diverſity.</hi> For <hi>Ewes</hi> have more <hi>caruncles,</hi> and thoſe of different <hi>magnitude;</hi> the biggeſt whereof are as large as a <hi>Nutmeg;</hi> the leaſt, as a <hi>Cich-peaſe,</hi> or <hi>Vetch:</hi> which are alſo of a <hi>round figure,</hi> and ruddy <hi>complexion,</hi> and their <hi>convex parts</hi> do reſpect the <hi>Uterus,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing like ſoft Warts, or Nipples. <hi>But Cowes have greater, flatter, and paler, which are of a ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy conſiſtence, like Muſh-rooms:</hi> and theſe ſeem to take their original from the <hi>Chorion. Hindes</hi> and <hi>Does</hi> have <hi>five</hi> onely; and thoſe bred out of the <hi>womb,</hi> do protuberate towards the <hi>conception,</hi> and there exhibit their Cavities. But being firmly faſtened to the <hi>Uterus,</hi> are not eaſily ſeparated from it; except it be when the <hi>birth</hi> is drawing nigh; at which time (like <hi>ripe fruits)</hi> they do very eaſily forego their former <hi>connexion.</hi> And being torn off from the <hi>womb,</hi> I have obſerved the greater part of the Blood which flowes after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to iſſue, not from the <hi>Conception,</hi> but from the <hi>Uterus</hi> it ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fabricius</hi> treating of the Union of this <hi>Carnous ſubſtance</hi> with the <hi>Vterus,</hi> doth labour by many (but weak) <hi>arguments</hi> to prove, that the <hi>Vmbilical</hi>
               <pb n="429" facs="tcp:56144:285"/>
               <hi>veſſels,</hi> do join to the extremities of the <hi>veſſels</hi> of the <hi>Womb</hi> by ſeveral inſertions: and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>De form. foet.</hi> pag. 122.</note> this he doth undertake, chiefly, to countenance the old opinion received almoſt by all: for he confeſſeth that he can deliver nothing certaine touching this matter, <hi>becauſe the Carnous ſubſtance hinders a man from diſcovering the truth thereof.</hi> But yet neither ſenſe, nor reaſon do evince, that there are any more <hi>Anaſtomoſes</hi> in the <hi>Vterus,</hi> then in the <hi>Liver,</hi> between the branches of the <hi>Gate,</hi> and <hi>Hollow-vein;</hi> or in the <hi>Breaſts,</hi> between the <hi>veins</hi> which convey <hi>blood,</hi> and thoſe that <hi>waft</hi> the <hi>Milk.</hi> There is indeed, in ſome places a kind of <hi>contigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> or <hi>juxtapoſition</hi> of thoſe <hi>veſſels,</hi> and ſometimes an inſertion of the one into the <hi>Coat</hi> of the other; but no where any ſuch <hi>coalition,</hi> or <hi>Vnion,</hi> as <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricius</hi> conceiteth. For were it ſo, the veines ought to be inſerted into the Arteries: for the veſſels, which do convey <hi>blood</hi> into the <hi>Vterus</hi> and <hi>Caruncles</hi> are <hi>Arteries:</hi> but they which tranſport it from the <hi>Vterus</hi> to the <hi>Foetus,</hi> are Veins, as is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to all men; becauſe they waft the <hi>blood</hi> from the <hi>After-birth</hi> into the <hi>Hollow-vein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore the Opinion of <hi>Arantius</hi> ſeems to me to be more true; namly that the Orifices of the <hi>Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilical veſſels</hi> are not united to the Orifices of the Veſſels of the womb. For there are fewer Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels conducting <hi>blood</hi> to the womb, then veins re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning it to the <hi>foetus:</hi> and the greateſt part of the propagations of theſe are terminated in the <hi>Chorion.</hi> And yet <hi>Fabricius,</hi> either overſwayed by his reſpects to <hi>Antiquity,</hi> or his envy to <hi>Aran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> doth ſtubborny perſiſt in the patronage of the old opinion.</p>
            <p>As concerning the <hi>Cotelydones,</hi> or <hi>Acetabula,</hi>

               <pb n="530" facs="tcp:56144:286"/>
               <hi>Fabricius</hi> concludeth nothing certain: but only compileth the ſeveral opinions of <hi>Antiquity.</hi> But we have before, in the Hiſtory of <hi>Hinds</hi> and <hi>Does,</hi> ſhewed in what Animals theſe <hi>Acetabula</hi> are; where we have withal ſignified, that they are certain litle Cells of ſmall capacity, diſperſed through the Caruncles or fleſhy ſubſtance, and fraught with a white, or gellyiſh ſubſtance: as the <hi>Honey-comb</hi> is full of <hi>Honey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Hinds, they do fitly reſemble the ſhape of that cavity in the <hi>Haunch-bone</hi> which receiveth the <hi>Bone</hi> of the <hi>Thigh;</hi> and therefore they are by the Greeks called <hi>Cotyledones:</hi> and in Latine, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetabula,</hi> becauſe they reſemble thoſe litle Veſſels or Sawſers, which were anciently brought to the table with Vineger for ſawce. Theſe cavities do not exceed in magnitude the perforations of a large ſponge, and into each of them, ſo many ſlender ſprigs of the <hi>Umbilical</hi> Veſſels do deeply inſinuate themſelves; becauſe in them is laid up the <hi>ſuſtenance</hi> of the <hi>foetus,</hi> and not <hi>blood</hi> (as <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricius</hi> conceived) but a gelly reſembling the thicker white of an <hi>egge.</hi> Whereby it appears (as we have formerly declared) that the <hi>foetus</hi> of ſuch as <hi>cleave the hoof</hi> (as likewiſe all other) are not ſuſteined by the <hi>mothers blood.</hi>

               <hi>Acetabula, that they are diminiſhed as the</hi> Foetus <hi>doth improve:</hi> is contrary to experience; for the larger the <hi>foetus,</hi> the larger the <hi>caruncles</hi> alſo, and their <hi>Acetabula,</hi> or <hi>cavities,</hi> are more capacious, and more numerous, and more full of an <hi>albugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous juice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you compreſs theſe <hi>caruncles,</hi> no blood at all doth iſſue out; but as water, or honey doth

            <p>
               <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> indeed doth truly affirm, that theſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetabula</hi> are not in all Animals; for they are not in Women, nor in any elſe (as far as I know) who have onely one carnous ſubſtance in their <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus.</hi> But as for their office and uſe: I conceive that all the Caruncles (like Breaſts) do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein blood, but digeſt a ſap, like to the White of an Egge, which they do adminiſter to nouriſh the <hi>foetus.</hi>

            <p>The Veins, ſaith he, <hi>paſſing from the</hi> Uterus <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the</hi> Foetus, <hi>are ever united, and improved: nor doth their conjunction give over, until two large</hi> Trunks <hi>do reſult out of them all; which penetrating the Navel of the</hi> Infant, <hi>they do conſtitute one onely large</hi> Trunk; <hi>which is inſerted into the</hi> Liver <hi>of the</hi> Infant, <hi>and perforated into the Hollow and</hi> Gate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vein. <hi>In like manner, the</hi> Arteries <hi>adjoined to theſe</hi> Veins, <hi>which are very numerous, and ſmall, paſſing on from the</hi> Womb <hi>to the</hi> Foetus, <hi>and at laſt uniting their forces together, and ſo enlarging, do conſpire into two large</hi> Trunks <hi>alſo; which after they have paſſed the</hi> Navel, <hi>do ſeparate themſelves and break company from the</hi> Veins, <hi>and ſticking to the ſides of the Bladder of</hi> Urine, <hi>by the help of an intervening</hi> Membrane; <hi>they do here and there diſperſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi>

               <hi>into the branches of the great</hi> Artery <hi>deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the</hi> Thighs. But we muſt take notice that this deſcription given by <hi>Fabricius,</hi> doth agree only to the <hi>Navel</hi> of an <hi>Infant,</hi> and is not common to the <hi>foetus</hi> of every <hi>Animal</hi> at large: Nor yet to an Infant neither, but after it is fully formed; for the Arteries (at the <hi>beginning,)</hi> are inconſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous, as being ſo ſlender, that we have need of the quick ſight of a <hi>Lynceus</hi> to diſcern them: nor do they indeed reveal themſelves afterwards, but only by their <hi>pulſation:</hi> for in other things they are no way diſtinguiſhable from Veins. Becauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as I have ſhewed elſewhere) the ſlender bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches or filaments of the Arteries have no pulſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (at leſt ſo far as we can diſcover) they cannot be known from Veins: for they are at that time ſo thin &amp; ſubtle, that they are woven to the coats of the <hi>veins</hi> like the <hi>fineſt threds:</hi> or rather do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurly inſinuate themſelves into the <hi>tunicles</hi> of the <hi>veins:</hi> whereby they are utterly indiſcernable. But all the <hi>veins</hi> (by a retrograde production) uniting their ſprigs at laſt, do all conſpire into one <hi>Trunk,</hi> (as all the branches into one ſtock) as alſo the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeraick</hi> Veins are all concluded in the <hi>Venae Portae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neer the <hi>Embryo,</hi> they are divided into two Trunks; but when once they enter into him, they do conſtitute one onely <hi>Navel,</hi> which doth termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in the <hi>Hollow-vein,</hi> neer the right <hi>deaf-eare</hi> of the <hi>Heart;</hi> &amp; paſſing through the <hi>Liver,</hi> is inſerted into the <hi>Gate-vein,</hi> and doth ſcatter no more Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagations, untill by a very large <hi>Orifice</hi> it diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelf out of the <hi>gibbous part</hi> of the <hi>liver.</hi> So that if you open the Trunk of the <hi>Hollow-vein</hi> from the <hi>deaf-ear</hi> of the <hi>Heart,</hi> downwards, and ſo exhauſt it of all its <hi>blood,</hi> you may perceive <hi>three Orifices</hi> as
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:56144:287"/>
conjoined together; one whereof is the entrance into the deſcending Trunk of the <hi>Hollow vein,</hi> the other is the going out of the <hi>Branch</hi> of the <hi>Liver</hi> diſſeminated through all its <hi>gibbous part;</hi> but the third is the <hi>Original</hi> of this <hi>Umbilical vein.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it clearly appeareth, that the <hi>original</hi> of the <hi>veins</hi> is not to be ſought for in the <hi>Liver:</hi> becauſe the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice</hi> of the <hi>deſcending Trunk</hi> of the <hi>Hollow-vein</hi> is much larger then the <hi>Liver-branch;</hi> for the <hi>Umbili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal branch</hi> is as large as that. But the <hi>Branches</hi> are never ſaid to be the <hi>Original</hi> of their <hi>Trunk,</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther where the <hi>Trunk</hi> is largeſt, there are wee to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the <hi>Original</hi> of the <hi>branches</hi> toreſide: now that happeneth at the <hi>entrance</hi> of the right <hi>ventricle</hi> of the <hi>Heart;</hi> and therefore that <hi>ventricle</hi> is to be acc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ounted the <hi>original,</hi> &amp; <hi>promptuary</hi> of all the <hi>veins.</hi>

            <p>I return now to the <hi>Umbilical veſſels,</hi> which are not divided after the ſame maner in all Animals; for there are found in ſome 2. or more litle Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the body of the <hi>foetus;</hi> whereof ſome paſs into the <hi>Liver,</hi> others into the <hi>Vena Portae,</hi> or <hi>Meſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raical veins.</hi> But in a <hi>human foetus,</hi> the <hi>Trunks</hi> of the <hi>veins</hi> &amp; <hi>arteries</hi> being involved together, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated, ſome 3. or 4.

<pb n="534" facs="tcp:56144:288"/>
               <hi>litle knobbs,</hi> or <hi>warts,</hi> as it were by litle <hi>bladders</hi> full of <hi>blood,</hi> that ſo the <hi>blood</hi> might not ruſh in too forcibly upon the <hi>foetus.</hi> By the number of theſe protuberations, the ſuperſtitious <hi>Midwives</hi> do ſpend their divination concerning the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>children</hi> yet to come; and in caſe they finde none of theſe <hi>knobs,</hi> they pronounce the Woman <hi>barren</hi> for the future; and likewiſe by the diſtance betweene theſe protuberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they fondly propheſie of the ſpace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>childe</hi> and <hi>childe;</hi> and alſo of the <hi>diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> of the <hi>Sex,</hi> from the variety of their <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion.</hi>

            <p>Alſo the conſtitution of the <hi>Umbilical veſsels</hi> is like to this, in almoſt all other <hi>foetuſes</hi> which have but one onely <hi>Uterine cake;</hi> namely, in <hi>Bitches, Mice,</hi> and others: but the litle <hi>cord</hi> is in them ſhorter, and leſs complicated. But in <hi>Cows, Ews, Hindes, Does, Sowes,</hi> and other Animals, whoſe <hi>foetus</hi> is not ſuſtained by <hi>aliment</hi> derived from one <hi>carnous ſubſtance,</hi> or <hi>cake,</hi> but from diverſe, the <hi>diſtribution</hi> of the <hi>Umbilical veſsels</hi> is alſo diverſe: For the litle <hi>branches,</hi> or terminations of the <hi>veſsels</hi> are not diſſeminated through the <hi>cake</hi> onely, but alſo (and that chiefly too) without it, through the <hi>coat</hi> called <hi>Chorion,</hi> diſpatching their moſt ſlender <hi>fibers</hi> thither likewiſe: juſt as the <hi>diſtribution</hi> of the <hi>Umbilical veſsels</hi> (namely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the litle <hi>cord)</hi> appeareth in a <hi>humane foetus,</hi> before the <hi>conception</hi> is faſtened to the <hi>Uterus.</hi> Whereby it appeareth, that the <hi>Embryo</hi> doth not derive all his Aliment from the <hi>cake;</hi> but part thereof, and that the chiefeſt, from the <hi>humor</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the <hi>Chorion.</hi>

            <p>As touching the <hi>uſes</hi> of the <hi>Vmbilical veſsels,</hi>
               <pb n="535" facs="tcp:56144:288"/>
I do not conſent with <hi>Fabricius:</hi> for he is of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that all the <hi>blood</hi> is derived to the <hi>foetus</hi> from the <hi>Vterus</hi> by the <hi>veines;</hi> and the <hi>vital ſpirits</hi> from the <hi>mother</hi> by the <hi>Arteries.</hi> He alſo denyeth, that any part of the <hi>foetus</hi> in the <hi>womb</hi> doth execute any <hi>publick function:</hi> but affirmeth, that each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular part taketh care onely for it ſelfe, how it may be nouriſhed, augmented, and preſerved. And alſo, becauſe he findeth no <hi>Nerve</hi> amongſt the <hi>Umbilical</hi> Veſſels, he concludeth the <hi>foetus</hi> to be void of all <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Motion:</hi> Implying, that the <hi>Mothers Womb,</hi> or the <hi>Uterine Cake,</hi> is as it were the <hi>Heart,</hi> and <hi>Original</hi> from whence all things ſpring to the <hi>foetus,</hi> and from whence the <hi>Influent heat</hi> is divided amongſt all the parts. All which are manifeſt miſtakes. For the <hi>Humane Embryc,</hi> when he is not yet four moneths ſtanding in the <hi>Womb</hi> (and ſome ſooner) exerciſeth an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent <hi>motion, volutation,</hi> and <hi>calcitration:</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if he be prejudiced by extremity of <hi>cold</hi> or <hi>heat,</hi> or any other outward inconvenience. Likewiſe the <hi>Punctum ſaliens</hi> it ſelf, (before the <hi>Heart</hi> is erected) doth ſtirre by an apparent <hi>pulſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and alſo diſtribute blood, and ſpirits: and being (as we have obſerved) reduced to a dying and langiuiſhing condition by cold, is by the freſh acceſſion of heat, kindled anew, and revived. And alſo in the <hi>Caeſarean birth,</hi> it is very evident, that the <hi>Embryo</hi>'s life doth not immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the <hi>Parent,</hi> nor the <hi>Spirits</hi> reſult from her: for we have often ſeen <hi>Infants,</hi> which have been cut out of their <hi>Mothers Womb,</hi> ſurvive their <hi>Parent</hi> for ſeveral hours: and have alſo known a <hi>Cony</hi> and a <hi>Hare</hi> which did live, though they were born by <hi>inciſion</hi> made upon the <hi>Uterus</hi> of
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:56144:289"/>
their <hi>Parents.</hi> Moreover, it is a ſure way to know whether the <hi>Infant</hi> that ſticketh in the birth be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, or not, by the pulſation of the <hi>Vmbilical</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries. But moſt certain it is, that thoſe Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are not moved by the virtue or operation of the Mothers, but of his own proper <hi>Heart:</hi> For they keep a diſtinct time and pawze, from the Mothers <hi>pulſe:</hi> which is eaſily experimented, if you lay one hand upon the <hi>Mothers</hi> wreſt, and the other on the <hi>Infants Navel-ſtring.</hi> Nay in a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarean Section,</hi> when the <hi>Embryo</hi>'s have been yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in the <hi>membrane</hi> called <hi>Chorion,</hi> I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes found (even when the Mother was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, and ſtiffe almoſt with cold) the <hi>Vmbilical</hi> Arteries beating, and the <hi>Foetus</hi> himſelf luſty. Wherefore it is not true, that the <hi>Spirits</hi> do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the <hi>foetus</hi> from the <hi>Mothers Arteries:</hi> nor is that more true; namely, that the <hi>Vmbilical</hi> Veſſels of the <hi>foetus</hi> are conjoined by <hi>Anaſtomoſis,</hi> to the Veſſels of the <hi>Vterus.</hi> For the <hi>Foetus</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeth his own proper life, and is furniſhed with beating Arteries, which are full of <hi>Blood,</hi> and <hi>Spirits</hi> long before the <hi>conception</hi> (in which he is formed, and walloweth) doth cleave to the <hi>Vterus:</hi> juſt as it is with Chicken in the Egge.</p>
            <p>As for the uſe of the Arteries in the <hi>foetus</hi> (as alſo in grown bodies) we have in our Treatiſe of the Circulation of the blood, demonſtrated it to be much different from what hath been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received: all which is alſo confirmed from hence.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Secundines;</hi> they alſo are an undeniable part of the Conception, and do depend upon the <hi>Foetus,</hi> aſſuming life and their vegetal faculty from him. For as in the <hi>Meſentery,</hi> the blood

            <p>There came forth a Book of late, wrote by <hi>Adrianus Spigelius,</hi> entituled <hi>De formato Foetu,</hi> of the formed <hi>foetus:</hi> wherein he treateth concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Uſe of the Umbilical Arteries; and doth demonſtrate by powerful arguments, that the <hi>Foetus</hi> doth not receive its Vital Spirits by the Arteries from the <hi>Mother:</hi> and hath fully anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thoſe arguments which are alledged to the contrary.

               <hi>FAbricius</hi> hath indeed recounted many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous things, concerning the <hi>Birth,</hi> but wee meet with more things worthy our wonder con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Conception.</hi> It is indeed a dark, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure buſineſs; however we ſhall adventure to propoſe ſomething in a <hi>problematical</hi> way, in ſuch ſort that it ſhall appeare we doe not onely goe about to ſubvert other mens opinions, but alſo to diſcloſe our owne. And yet whatſoever falleth from me concerning this ſubject, I deſire may not be ſo taken, as if I conceived them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by an <hi>Oracle;</hi> but that liberty which I freely allow all other men, I doe of right chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to my ſelf; that ſo I may offer thoſe things as true, which ſeem probable in ſuch dark mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, until ſuch time as they can be convinced of falſity or errour.</p>
            <p>This imployment doth chiefly relate to the <hi>Uterus,</hi> without whoſe <hi>preparations</hi> and <hi>functions,</hi> you may in vaine expect a <hi>Conception.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is certaine, that the <hi>Geniture</hi> of the <hi>Male</hi> doth not ſo much as reach to the <hi>cavity</hi> of the <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus,</hi> much leſs abide there for any time; that <hi>geniture</hi> doth derive <hi>foecundity</hi> to the <hi>Uterus</hi> only by a kinde of <hi>contagion,</hi> (not as if it were now <hi>tangent,</hi> and <hi>operating,</hi> but becauſe it hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly <hi>touched.)</hi> The <hi>Woman</hi> or <hi>Female</hi> doth ſeem after the <hi>ſpermatical, contact</hi> (in <hi>coition)</hi> to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in the ſame manner, and to be rendered <hi>prolifical,</hi> by no <hi>ſenſible corporeal Agent,</hi> as the <hi>Iron</hi>
               <pb n="540" facs="tcp:56144:291"/>
touched by the <hi>Loadſtone,</hi> is preſently indowed with the virtue of the <hi>Loadſtone,</hi> and doth draw other iron-bodies unto it. Namely, having once received that virtue, which we have ſpoken of, it doth exerciſe the <hi>plaſtick generative power,</hi> and <hi>procreateth</hi> its own like, no otherwiſe then <hi>plants</hi> doe, which we ſee are impowered with the force of both <hi>Sexes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I cannot but wonder, where that <hi>faculty,</hi> (when the act of <hi>coition</hi> is finiſhed, before the production of the <hi>Egge</hi> or <hi>Conception</hi> doth reſide? and to what that <hi>active vertue</hi> of the <hi>Male</hi> is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted? namely, whether to the <hi>Uterus</hi> alone, or to the whole <hi>Female?</hi> or rather, primarily to the <hi>Uterus,</hi> but ſecondarily to the <hi>Female?</hi> or laſtly, whether, as we ſee with our <hi>eyes,</hi> and think with our <hi>braines,</hi> ſo a <hi>female</hi> doth conceive with her <hi>Vterus?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For though the <hi>female</hi> ſometimes (conceiving after <hi>coition)</hi> doth not produce a <hi>Foetus:</hi> yet we know that thoſe <hi>Symptomes</hi> did enſue, which gave a cleare teſtimony of a <hi>conception</hi> ſet on foot, (though it came to nothing.) Your litle <hi>Bitches</hi> which are kept too plentifully, and thereupon admit <hi>coition</hi> (without ſucceſs) are notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding obſerved to be ſluggiſh about the juſt time whereat they ought to <hi>puppy,</hi> and bark as if they were in <hi>diſtreſs,</hi> and likewiſe filtch away the young <hi>whelps</hi> from another <hi>Bitch,</hi> and lick them over and cheriſh them, (as tenderly as if they were their own natural productions) and fight eagerly to keep them from the true <hi>Parent.</hi> Nay ſome of them have <hi>milk,</hi> or <hi>beeſtings</hi> (as they call it) in their <hi>teats;</hi> and are obnoxious to the diſtempers incident to thoſe that have really <hi>pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied;</hi>
               <pb n="541" facs="tcp:56144:291"/>
juſt as <hi>Hennes</hi> will cluck in their ſeaſon, though they have no <hi>eggs</hi> at all to <hi>ſit upon.</hi> Some kinde of <hi>birds</hi> (as namely <hi>Pigeons)</hi> if they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <hi>coition</hi> at the wonted time, though they lay no <hi>eggs</hi> at all, or <hi>ſubventaneous</hi> ones onely, yet are poſſeſſed with their uſual ſedulity &amp; providence of <hi>building neſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the vertue proceeding from the <hi>Male,</hi> doth ſo largely fructifie the whole <hi>Female,</hi> that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth a thorough change and alteration, as well in the frame of their <hi>minds,</hi> as in the conſtitution of their <hi>bodies.</hi> And though this doe principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happen to the <hi>Vterus</hi> fitted for the impreſſion; and from thence the power and efficacy thereof be derived to the whole <hi>body;</hi> (as from the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent <hi>teſticles</hi> of the <hi>Male,</hi> there is an acceſſion of ſtrength ſuperadded to the whole <hi>body)</hi> yet the ſame ſcruple remaines: namely, how this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er communicated to the <hi>Vterus</hi> it ſelfe, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here in it? as whether in the whole <hi>Vterus,</hi> or in any one part of it onely? For there is nothing to be found abiding therein after <hi>coition:</hi> for the <hi>geniture</hi> of the <hi>Male</hi> doth either ſuddenly fall out againe, or vaniſh away, and the blood doth <hi>circulate</hi> againe from the <hi>uterus,</hi> by the <hi>veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, what <hi>preparation</hi> or <hi>maturity</hi> of the <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus</hi> is it, that doth require the <hi>genitall ſeed;</hi> or from whence doth it proceed? for unleſs the <hi>ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> be prepared for <hi>coition,</hi> all other attempts are fruſtrate; nay ſeveral <hi>animals</hi> doe not admit <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition</hi> it ſelf, without they be thus prepared. That <hi>maturity,</hi> I confeſs, doth ſooner befall them, by reaſon of their converſe with the <hi>Male,</hi> and the incitements which he uſeth to provoke them; yet
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:56144:292"/>
it is procured (as that ripeneſs of <hi>fruits</hi> in <hi>plants)</hi> by natures owne inclination and tendency. But what this <hi>Alteration</hi> is, I ſhall now deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, according as I have found it by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all the <hi>uterus</hi> appears <hi>thicker</hi> and more <hi>fleſhy:</hi> and afterwards (foraſmuch as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>interiour ſuperficies,</hi> which is the place where the future <hi>conception</hi> is to be received) it groweth more <hi>tender,</hi> anſwering in <hi>lubri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi> and <hi>ſoftneſs</hi> to the internal ventricles of the <hi>Braine,</hi> as we have even now affirmed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Hindes,</hi> and other creatures which <hi>cleave the hoofe.</hi> But in <hi>Bitches, Cats,</hi> and other multipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Animals, whoſe <hi>feet</hi> are diſtinguiſhed into <hi>toes,</hi> the hornes of the <hi>Wombe</hi> doe exactly reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the litle ſmooth trumpets of a womans <hi>womb,</hi> or the <hi>appendixes</hi> of the guts of <hi>Birds,</hi> or the <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reters</hi> in <hi>Men:</hi> and in ſome places have litle <hi>knobs</hi> which doe <hi>ſwell inward,</hi> and become exceeding ſoft, through which, after <hi>coition</hi> (as we have obſerved in Hinds and Does) as if they did open themſelves, the firſt albugineous humours doe tranſpire into the capacity of the <hi>Uterus,</hi> out of which humours the Conception or Egge is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. And this is the manner how the <hi>Uterus</hi> is by the Coition of the <hi>Male</hi> (like Fruit by the <hi>Summer heat) impregnated,</hi> and heightned into the higheſt pitch of maturity.</p>
            <p>But becauſe there are no manifeſt ſigns of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception viſible, before the <hi>Uterus</hi> doth begin to open, and the albugineous liquor, or ſlender threads, (like the Spiders web) and the firſt <hi>rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of the future Egge or Conception appear: and ſeeing the ſubſtance of the <hi>Uterus,</hi> now ready
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:56144:292"/>
for <hi>Conception,</hi> doth ſo neerly reſemble the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Braine: why may we not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that both their functions are alſo alike; and that ſomething like, if not the ſelfe ſame thing that the <hi>phantaſme,</hi> or <hi>appetite</hi> is to the <hi>brain,</hi> is excited in the <hi>Uterus:</hi> from which the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or procreation of the <hi>Egge</hi> doth ſucceed? for both their functions are equally called <hi>concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and both are <hi>Immaterial;</hi> though they be the <hi>principles</hi> of all the <hi>actions</hi> of the <hi>body:</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this, of the Natural, that of the Animal actions: this the firſt cauſe and principle of all actions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the generation of <hi>Animals,</hi> &amp; that of all actions tending to their preſervation. And as <hi>Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite</hi> doth ſpring from the <hi>conception</hi> of the <hi>braine,</hi> and that <hi>conception</hi> from the outward <hi>appetible</hi> or <hi>deſirable objects:</hi> So alſo from the <hi>Male</hi> (as being the more <hi>perfect Animal)</hi> as from the moſt natural ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petible object, the natural conception dothariſe in the <hi>Uterus,</hi> as the Animal conception in the Brain.</p>
            <p>And from this Appetite or Conception it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to paſs, that the female doth produce an off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring like the male Genitor. For as we, from the Conception of the Form, or Idea, in the Braine, do faſhion a form like to it in our works, ſo doth the Idea or Species of the Genitor, reſiding in the <hi>Uterus,</hi> by the help of the formative facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, beget a <hi>Foetus</hi> like the Genitor himſelf; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by implanting that <hi>Immaterial ſpecies</hi> which it hath, upon its Workmanſhip. In like manner as <hi>Art,</hi> which is the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or Species of the future work, doth produce a Like in its operation, and generate it in the <hi>matter:</hi> As the Builder erects a Houſe, according to his pre-received conception. And the ſame thing happeneth in other produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:56144:293"/>
and artificial generations. So that what diſcipline doth effect in the <hi>Braine,</hi> namely Art, that in proportion doth the Coition of the Male effect in the <hi>Uterus,</hi> namely the <hi>plaſtical Art:</hi> whereby ſeveral <hi>foetuſes</hi> are procreated either like or unlike, by the ſame Coition. For if the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, and firſt artificial conceptions (which are onely imitations of the natural) are thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the Braine; how much more probable is it, that the Exemplars of Animal Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and conception, are in like manner produced by the <hi>Uterus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And becauſe Nature (all whoſe works are admirable and divine) doth inſtitute ſuch an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan (namely the Braine) by whoſe ſenſitive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and virtue, the conceptions of the rational ſoule doe exiſt; namely Deſires, and Arts, and the Principles and Cauſes of ſo many ſeveral pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, whereof man (by the motive faculty of the <hi>Braine)</hi> is the Author by Imitation; why ſhall we not think, that the ſame Nature, which hath contrived the Womb, which is a no leſſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Organ then the Braine, and hath framed it of a like conſtitution to execute the office of Conception, hath deſigned it alſo to a like fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or at leaſt to one which beareth an Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy with it: and that Nature did intend an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan which is every way like the Braine, to an imployment, like to that to which the Braine is aſſigned? For ſince a skilful Artificer, doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh his Workmanſhip, by his ingenious proportioning one Inſtrument to one thing, and the ſame to the ſame, and the like to the like: So that by the materials and ſhape of his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, a man may eaſily judge of their uſe and

            <p>But ſuch is the prepoſterous ſucceſs of things, that when we come to debate cuſtomary and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar things, their frequency doth diminiſh their greatneſs, and admiration which is due unto them; but when matters of leſs conſequence (but ſuch as are more unuſual) do preſent themſelves, wee inſtantly magnifie them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their novelty and rarity. Whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall weigh with himſelf, how the <hi>brain</hi> of the <hi>Artiſt,</hi> or the <hi>Artiſt</hi> himſelf by virtue of his <hi>brain,</hi> doth form things which are not preſent with him, but ſuch as he only hath formerly ſeen, ſo much to the <hi>life:</hi> and how litle <hi>birds</hi> which immure themſelves all win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long, do exactly <hi>chant,</hi> and recall to minde thoſe <hi>Ditties,</hi> the next <hi>Spring,</hi> which they had learned the <hi>Summer</hi> before, though they did never practiſe them all the while; and which is yet more ſtrange, how a litle <hi>bird</hi> will moſt <hi>artificially</hi> contrive a <hi>Neſt</hi> (whereof ſhee never ſaw any <hi>platform</hi> before) and that not from her <hi>memory,</hi> or any <hi>habit</hi> implanted in her, but onely by meere <hi>phanſie:</hi> and how a young <hi>Spider,</hi> without any <hi>pattern,</hi> or <hi>brain,</hi> by the help of <hi>phanſie</hi> onely, doth

            </p>
            <p>I know full well, that ſome ſcoffing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons will laugh at theſe conjectures; appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing but their owne private inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

            <p>Becauſe, I ſay, there is no <hi>Senſible thing</hi> to be found in the <hi>Uterus,</hi> after <hi>coition;</hi> and yet there is a neceſſity, that ſomething ſhould be there, which may render the <hi>female fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;</hi> and that (in probability) can be no <hi>corporeal eſſence;</hi> we have no refuge left us, but to fly to meere <hi>Conception,</hi> and <hi>reception</hi> of <hi>Species</hi> without any matter; namely, to apprehend, that the ſame thing is effected in the <hi>womb,</hi> as in the <hi>Braine:</hi> unleſs ſome cunning <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher,</hi> whom the Gods have better provided for, can finde out ſome <hi>efficient cauſe,</hi> which is not concluded in our recapitulation.</p>
            <p>Some <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> even of our owne time, have furbuſhed over the old opinion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Atomes:</hi> and doe therefore conceive, that this <hi>Contagion</hi> (as alſo all other) doth proceed from the moſt ſubtle <hi>effluviums,</hi> or <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manations</hi> of the <hi>maſculine ſeed,</hi> which do eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tranſpire after the manner of <hi>Odours,</hi> and ſo are ſhot into the <hi>Uterus</hi> at the time of <hi>coi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Some againe raiſe up certaine <hi>incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real ſpirits,</hi> like ſo many <hi>Agents, Angels,</hi> or <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</hi> Others underſtand a <hi>Contagion,</hi> like to a kinde of <hi>ferment,</hi> or <hi>ſower levening.</hi> Others <hi>phanſie,</hi> and imagine otherwiſe.

            <p>I have obſerved many things, which will eaſily extirpate the recited opinions of other men: (ſo that now it is much more obvious to ſay what it is not, then what it is) but thoſe Obſervations relate not to this place,
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:56144:295"/>
but muſt be propoſed elſewhere. At the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I ſhall ſay this onely: If that which we commonly call <hi>Contagion,</hi> as being derived from the <hi>ſpermatical contact</hi> in <hi>coition,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining behinde in the <hi>female,</hi> (when the <hi>Geniture</hi> it ſelfe is not then in preſence) is the <hi>efficient</hi> and <hi>operatour</hi> of the <hi>future procreation:</hi> if, I ſay, this <hi>Contagion</hi> (whether it be <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes,</hi> or <hi>Odour,</hi> or <hi>Ferment,</hi> or whatſoever elſe) be free from the nature of a <hi>body,</hi> it muſt of neceſſity be an <hi>incorporeal thing.</hi> And if moreover, upon enquiry it do appear, to be neither a <hi>Spirit,</hi> nor a <hi>Daemon,</hi> nor a <hi>Soul,</hi> nor any part of a <hi>Soul,</hi> nor yet ſomething which hath a <hi>Soul</hi> (as I conceive I can demonſtrate by ſeveral <hi>arguments,</hi> and <hi>experiments.)</hi> What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, ſince I can imagine nothing elſe, nor no man hath hitherto dreamed of any other thing, but freely to profeſs my ſelf to be at a ſtand? <hi>But He that doubts &amp; admires,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Wee ought not therefore to be condemned, if being deſirous of knowing things, and upon that account walking in untrodden paths, wee ſet before you ſomething, which, at firſt bluſh, may ſeem <hi>fabulous,</hi> and <hi>fictitious.</hi> For as all things are not to be ſwallowed with too much credulity; ſo thoſe things which have been exactly and long conſidered, are not utterly to be deſpiſed, though they doe not appeare ſo rare to ſharp-witted men.</p>

            <p>Having therefore overcome ſome difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which relate to this Subject, I have a ſtrong deſire to diſcourſe the Matter more cloſely: that what I have hitherto deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered curſorily, may ſeeme to carry a fairer probability at leaſt with it, and
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:56144:296"/>
alſo to excite the Wits of Studious men, to make a deeper ſearch into the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe.</p>
            <p>Therefore (that we may illuſtrate the thing the better) let <hi>A</hi> ſtand for the <hi>fruitfull egge</hi> (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the matter of the <hi>fruitfull chicken)</hi> which is <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable</hi> and <hi>convertible</hi> into a <hi>chicken,</hi> or is a <hi>chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in poſſe:</hi> and let <hi>B</hi> ſtand for that which <hi>fructifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> the <hi>egge,</hi> diſtinguiſhing it from a <hi>ſubventane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous egge:</hi> namely, the <hi>efficient cauſe</hi> of the <hi>chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,</hi> or that which doth alter the <hi>Egge,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert or terminate it into a <hi>chicken.</hi> And <hi>C</hi> for the <hi>chicken</hi> it ſelfe, or <hi>final cauſe,</hi> for whoſe ſake both the <hi>Egge,</hi> and that which fructifieth the <hi>Egge</hi> doe exiſt: namely, the <hi>act,</hi> or <hi>reaſon</hi> of the <hi>chicken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now we take it for granted (which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> doth demonſtrate) that every <hi>firſt Mover</hi> or <hi>Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer</hi> is together with that thing which is <hi>moved</hi> or <hi>altered</hi> by it.

For when the Phyſitian doth define Health, and the Maſon a Houſe, by either the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, or by Senſe, he uſeth to render the reaſons and cauſes of the thing which he doth effect, and alſo ſubjoineth the reaſon why hee maketh it ſo: though that cauſe which is the cauſe for whoſe ſake, which is the cauſe, and reaſon of the good and faire, is rather conjoined to the works of Nature, then of Art.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the End,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is the thing for whoſe</hi>

               <hi>ſake: as the thing for whoſe ſake we walk, is Health. For if you aſke, why a man doth walk, we reply, to continue his Health: and having made that anſwer, we conceive we have rendered the cauſe thereof. And therefore whatſoever is interpoſed, ſome other thing moving thereunto, is done for the Ends ſake: as Extenuation is procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi>
               <pb n="663" facs="tcp:56144:297"/>
               <hi>for Health ſake, or Purgation, or Phyſick, or any other inſtruments, for all thoſe are for the Ends ſake.</hi> And a while after. <hi>But we ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to ſeek out the firſt cauſe of every thing: as in other matters. As a man buildeth becauſe he is a Builder: but he is a Builder by reaſon of his Art of building: this therefore is the firſt cauſe: and ſo it is in all things whatſoever.</hi> And hereupon he affirmeth, <hi>that, that cauſe which doth firſt move, and in which the Reaſon and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>form doth lye, is a worthier, and more divine cauſe, then the material.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In every <hi>Natural Generation</hi> of <hi>Animals</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, both the <hi>matter</hi> out of which, and the <hi>efficient</hi> by which (namely <hi>A,</hi> the thing <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> and <hi>B,</hi> the <hi>thing moving)</hi> are both for the ſake of the <hi>Animal</hi> already begotten, or which is to be begotten: becauſe that which <hi>moveth,</hi> and is not <hi>moved</hi> it ſelfe, namely <hi>C,</hi> is alike in them both. For both they (namely <hi>A,</hi> &amp; <hi>B,)</hi> are both <hi>movable,</hi> and <hi>moved;</hi> namely the thing fructifying, which is <hi>B,</hi> (which doth <hi>both move</hi> and is <hi>moved,)</hi> and that thing which is <hi>fructified,</hi> which is <hi>A,</hi> namely the <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>Egge,</hi> which is onely <hi>moved</hi> or <hi>altered.</hi> Wherefore if no <hi>moveable thing</hi> be actually moved, unleſſe the thing <hi>moving</hi> be together preſent with it. Certainly, neither ſhall the <hi>Matter</hi> be <hi>moved,</hi> nor the <hi>Efficient move</hi> or <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> any thing, unleſſe the firſt <hi>mover</hi> bee in ſome ſort <hi>preſent</hi> too: <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>form,</hi> or <hi>ſpecies</hi> which is without <hi>Matter,</hi> and is the <hi>principal cauſe.

therefore it is a ſyllogiſme framed out of the firſt and neceſſary cauſes: namely,</p>

            <p>Indeed <hi>Natural,</hi> and <hi>Artificial Generation</hi> are after one and the ſame manner.

            <p>The <hi>Conception</hi> therefore of the <hi>Egge,</hi> or <hi>Uterus,</hi> is (in ſome ſort) like the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Braine it ſelfe, and both
