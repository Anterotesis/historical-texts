            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> paſſed lyttel of life where they had but a ſclender hope, that theyr deathe might profit theyr countrey. ¶ Gaius Marius dreamed, that if he did offer vp his doughter Calphurnia in ſacrifice, he ſhuld ouercome the Cymbri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, fierce and cruell ennemyes to his countrey. In the mornynge, callyng his dreame to mynde, ſory to ſlee his dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſoryer his countrey ſhulde ſtande in ieoperdie, he toke a knyfe, and folowed his dreame. Erecteus, a man wonderful moche in loue with his doughter, vppon lyke occaſion dyd euen the ſame. But to paſſe ouer manye an hundred hyſtories, worthy all eternall memorye, I can not without moch my diſprayſe, ſuffer noble Themiſtocles, to loſe his prayſe. This valiant capitayne, not withſtandyng he hadde done more honour to Athens his countrey, then did almoſt any other, was in ſpyte of all his memorable victoryes, banyſhed Athens. vndoubtedly if there
<pb facs="tcp:4494:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were any cauſe, that myght make a man enmy to his countrey, Themiſtocles had ſure a iuſte cauſe, to be vtter ennemye to Athens. He was than exyled, whan there were fewe pryncis, fewe nations, vnto whom, for the defence of his countreye, he had not done ſome dyſpleaſure. The choyſe was ſo euyll, the ſhyftes ſo fewe, that he was conſtrayned to ſeke fauoure at Xerxes hande, kynge of the Perſians whom he had not longe before diſcomfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in battayl. Which Xerxes in loue with vertue, taken with noble courage, yea thoughe it were his ennemye, coulde not but hyghly entertayne Themiſtocles. To be ſhorte, there was no man leſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdyng to his countrey than he, no man more bound to Xerxes than he was. The kynge laye ſoore vpon hym, oft prayenge hym, that he wolde conducte his hoſte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geynſte the vnkynd Atheniens. Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocles ſtylle refuſed it, and where as the kynge wolde make no ende of entyſyng hym agaynſte his countreye, he neyther fyndynge in his harte to do ſoo, neyther intendynge to deceyue a kynge, whome
<pb facs="tcp:4494:6"/>
he had founde ſo beneficiall, thoughte it a leſſe faut to rydde hym ſelfe by poyſon, than to go with an armye ayenſt his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue countrey.</p>

Is not this a good ſhepeherde, that woll not receiue ſhepe, which are ſtrayed from the flocke, excepte they giue hym money? A iewe for money, is made a ryght chriſtian. And a right chriſtian is taken for a miſcreaunt, for a iewe, for a turke, if he refuſe to giue a pounde for that is not worthe a penye. This good byſhoppe loued vs excedyng tenderlye, as longe as we gaue to hym

frankely our ſiluer. He gaue vs pardons plentuouſly, which brought vs far from purgatory, euen the nexte waye to helle, but now, that we ſe his chaffer is naught worthe, and therfore woll gyue naughte for it, this good father, hath chaunged his affection, and is ſo farre in loue with our ſowles, that he wolde with ſwerde ſeke for them in our bowels. I wol gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te hym for a while, we were, as he and his are, in errour, in blyndenes, if he loued vs, as ſurely he wolde, if he were our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as he calleth hym ſelfe: if he loued vs, wolde he ſeke the diſtruction of our lyues, we beinge in an euel belefe? ought he not rather, if he were but a good chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to knele on his bare knees vnto god, and deſyre hym, our bodyes myght kepe our ſoules, while we were better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed? If we were in a wronge feythe, dothe not he ſlee our ſoules, if our bodies by his meanes, be ſlayne, er we tourne? coulde he thus doo, thus entende, if he were goddes vicar? If he loued our ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les? if he ſought to brynge vs to ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Peter pence make Paule to do as he

dothe. Our holy father enioyeth no len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger our goodes: this loſſe greueth hym ſore, and yet he feareth thexample worſe than the domage. He is afrayde, leſte yf god proſper vs, that other kynges woll alſo paſſe as moche of hym, as our moſt noble kyng dothe. We be gone from him to Chriſte, whiche ſaythe, <hi>Qui uenit ad me, non eiiciam eum foras,</hi> He that commeth to me, I woll not ſee him caſt out of doores. Let our good father, which in very dede is moche meter to be a hogherde, than a ſhepeherde of men, let hym curſe, vntyll his tonge fall into hell, they ſhall be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that god bleſſeth. Let hym order his byndynge and loſynge, as luſte leadeth hym, There is one, that woll one day, ſe his ſawcye power tyed ſhorter. For what I pray you, is lefte for pride to chalenge, whan he ones taketh vpon hym to binde that, that god commaundeth to be leuſe, to leuſe that that god in any wyſe wolle haue bounden? God wolle all ſubiectes, peyne of eternall damnation, to obeye their princis. This good interpreter of goddis wyll, whan affection, gayne, or

feare of loſſe wol, delyuereth all pryncis ſubiectes from the bondes, that god hath knyt them in, and gyueth theym pardon, that leaue their duetie, that breke goddis commaundement, and curſeth all theym that wol not folow his malyce, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand goddis pleaſure. Peter and Paule toke vppon theym a power, and yet they graunted it to be cancelled within cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne lymyttes, they wente not oute of theyr bondes, they wolde not paſſe theyr rayles, but ſayde, they had power to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horte men, power to edifie, to reconcyle, but no power to ſcatter, to ſpoyle, to dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy. This good father is of an nother ſchole, a ſtudent of Rome, taught in the conſiſtorie of Cardynals, where though there be fewe good made, yet, there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth fewer good thither, but they depart as euyll, as they that be theyr readers. It is with them a gay ſchole poynte, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any drede of god, to breake that loue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bonde, whiche god hath ordeyned and ſette in nature, to holde togyther, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue and maynteyne a thynge in this worlde for mans welth and ſafetie moſte

God ordeyned kynges, magiſtrates, and rulers, commaundynge theym to be honoured, euen as fathers are of theym chyldren. This is the fyrſte precepte of the ſeconde table, wherin god ſetteth a polycie, and teacheth the workes, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarye vnto mannes lyfe. He ſhewethe of all thynges this to be the firſte, that ſome rule, and ſome obeye. Obedyence vndoubtedly is the knotte of al common weales, this broken they muſte nedes runne al heedlonge to vtter deſtruction. God woll in any caſe, ſubiectes owe this obedience to theyr rulers, he woll they be dettours of this, and neuer to ceaſe the

payenge of it. He requireth not onely ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of our bodyes, to be at our prynces commaundemente, but that our hartes, honour and ſerue his hyghnes, with all loue and feythfulnes. Marke howe this good Romiſhe vicar, ſupplieth his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters office, he giueth remiſſion of ſinnes, to theym that offende depeſte in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte: and curſeth all theym, that hate not goddes commandment. Good cauſe he can not haue to do ſo, and yet he kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, his thryft is paſte, if goddes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes be kepte, and his curſes not ſet by. Who wolde thynke, that god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des vycar, coulde call prynces, that were goinge ayenſte the turke, to tourne theyr force vpon chriſten princes, Who wolde thinke, that he him ſelfe, coulde be of any good belefe, beinge farder in loue with turkes, whiche ſeke nothynge more then the vtter ruyne of Chryſtes faythe, then with vs, that refuſe with our moneye to maintayne his pryde ayenſt god and his holy worde.

            <p>¶Not longe ſithens, a ientil ientilman, (I myght ſaye he was an ambaſſatour, but then percaſe men wolde go nyghe, to geſſe whome I meane) made, at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torne home, this reporte of vs, Thacty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie of Englyſhmen hath ben greate, if hiſtories be true, but if I maye iudge by any coniectures, it is nothynge ſo nowe.

            <p>¶We many nowe ſee, if we be not blyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than betels, why god ſuffered ſuche a nomber to riſe in the North, and after to

do no hurte to this realme, but rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedynge moche good. For beſydes, that ſuche were wieded away, as myght haue done hurte, if our enemies had come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes, how dyd that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>motion furniſſhe almooſte all Englande, with weapons, with harneys, and other thynges neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarye for warre? howe ſone were both the Sotherne and Northern men in a redy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, wantynge nothynge fytte, eyther for men that intended hurte to other, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for theym that purpoſed theyr owne ſafetie? Howe many yonge Ientylmen, that than were aſhamed they coulde ryde no better, ryde wel now? how many, that than lacked almoſte all thynge mete for a warry our, be nowe furnyſhed for all aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayes? God vndoubted dydde moche for vs, that of ſo euyll a thyng, we receyued ſo many commodities. Harneys, bowes, bylles, gunnes, with the reſt of the furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for ſoudiours, were prepared than. See the goodnes of god, that wold them all to be prepared than, and all to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued hole, ſounde, vnhurte for a better ſeaſon. They were commynge, whether
<pb facs="tcp:4494:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they dare come on or no, we ſhall ſee: they were commynge I ſaye, ageynſt whome our bowes oughte to be bente, to whoſe hedes our billes owe blowes, into whoſe boſomes our arowes ought to crepe. Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie it is, that men ſhulde be ſo mad, to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet their own miſery, rather than to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vs in welthe. greatte pitie to ſee, one chriſten armye ayenſt an other. But for as moche as they ſeke to doo vs iniurye, and we only to put of wronge, if it be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, we nede not doubte, but he woll be with vs, for whoſe cauſe we be compelled to fyghte. They can not be to fewe, that haue god on their ſide. They haue a feire bende of men, that haue a good cauſe, a good quarel to ſtande in. I wol for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon imagin vs to be the weker ſide, fewer in noumber, of leſſe power than our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries are, I wol not yet ſpeake of the feates, that Englyſhe men haue done in battayles.</p>
            <p>¶Well, we be not ſo many as our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are, what if we be fewer, yea and man for man of moche leſſe might than they are? May not the ſondrye promyſes

I knowe ſayth he, the lord helpeth his annoynted, and euen frome heauen hereth theym. Some truſte in charyottes, ſome in hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but we, in callynge vppon the lorde. God can, and oft tymes dothe pyne man and beaſt, euen in the myddes of all plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. God whan his wyll is, fedeth, where no foode is to be founde. And as folyſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, whan hym luſteth, confoundeth the wyttes of the wyſe, ſo weakenes, where god ſetteth to his hande, worketh won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and ſturdy ſtrength ſtandeth in no ſtede. It is the lorde, ſaythe Daniel, that on highe ruleth the kyngedomes of men, gyuyng them to whom he woll. God can as wel be no god, as not true of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſe. He ſaythe, who ſoo honoureth me, hym wol I make honorable. In an other
<pb facs="tcp:4494:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
place, the ſame god ſaythe, ſpeakynge of kynge Dauyd, bycauſe he hath ſette his loue vpon me, I woll ſe hym rydde from al his troubles, I wol defende hym, why ſo? it foloweth, he hath knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my name, he ſeketh my glorye: and therfore wham ſo euer he calleth vpon me, I woll here hym. yea I am with hym in all his cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and wol delyuer hym from them, I woll ſet hym hygher in honour, ſende hym longe lyfe, and ſhewe hym his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
            <p>¶ God maketh not this promyſe vnto kynge Dauyd alone, but vnto all kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that hartyly ſeke his glorye, for as god promyſed that, vnto hym, vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, ſo fyndinge the cauſe, in any other prynce, for whiche he bounde hym ſelfe to be good vnto kynge Dauyd, he falleth not to performe now, that he than promiſed. We haue plentifull examples of this. God ſuffered the Moabites and Ammonites, to ſet vpon good kyng Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaphat, to trouble him with warre. This good kynge complayned, and made his mone. vnto whom I praye you? vnto the
<pb facs="tcp:4494:14"/>
lorde, from whens commeth all helpe, all ayde, and ſuccoure. What ſayde he? euen that that all prynces, troubled with to great a force, ought to ſay, he ſayd thus, The Moabites, the Ammonites, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitantes of Seir, are come in batayle ayenſt vs, wolt not thou our god, ſe them iudged, ſe them puniſhed? We haue noo might ayenſt this gret nombre, that ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vppon vs, we wote not what to doo, but our eyes, o lorde, be caſte vppon the. The lorde ſtraight harde his praier, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge in Iezaiels mouthe theſe wordes that folowe. Thus ſaythe the lorde vnto you, be not a frayde, or faynte harted, by reaſon of this greatte multytude: <hi>For the warre is not yours, but Goddes.</hi> On the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe, kynge Ioſaphat, after his coming forth towarde his enemies, ſayde in this wyſe to his army: It is not your partes, at the leaſte it ſhall lyttell neade, that ye fyght in this quarell, come forthe, ſtand, and beholde the helpe of the lorde, which is with you, feare not, let not your hartes fayle you. Herken vnto me Iuda, and ye inhabitours of Hieruſalem. Truſte the

lorde our god, and ſoo ſhall ye continue, beleue his prophetes, and then ſhall ye proſper. Whan he had ſayd thus, he com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maunded his ſyngynge men, with this ſonge to laude god. <hi>Prayſe ye the lord, for he is gratious, his mercy endureth for euer.</hi> Whyle they were thus gyuing laudes vnto god there roſe a ſedition amonge theyr enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, whiche ceaſed not, tyl they were al ſlayne, not one left alyue.</p>
            <p>¶ Amaſias prepared a great hoſte, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſynge throughe the multytude and ſtrengthe of his army to vanquyſſhe his ennemyes. The man of god (as they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led hym) came to Amaſias, and ſayde, ſir let not the armye of Iſrael goo with the, for the lorde is not with Iſraell, neyther with any of the houſe of Ephraim. If thou wylte neades haue them, make thy ſelfe as ſtronge to batteyl as thou canſte, thou ſhalt ſe, god wyl make the fal before thyne enemies. Here Amaſias comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge them of Ephraim to retorne home agayn, went with his owne hoſt, a ſmall nombre, and ſlewe .x. M. of his enemies, and toke other .x.

            <p>¶ Kynge Ioſias, with all goodlye reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, toke vpon hym the defence of true religion, the maintenaunce of true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippynge of god, he beate downe the Idols, he cut downe theyr woodes, and diſtroyed theyr hyl aulters. All princes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout hym feared hym, none ſo hardy as to offer hym battayle, princes, had lerned by longe experyence, howe lyttel greateſt power ſerueth ayenſte them, whom god defendeth.</p>
            <p>¶ Ezechias a godly prynce, of feruente zeale, ſtyll occupyed in clenſynge his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme of idolatrye, was greuouſely aſſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by a puſant hoſt of Sennacherib the emperour of the Aſſirians, in ſoo moche that he was required by hym, to yelde vp Hieruſalem. Ezechias turned hym from the helpe of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to the ayde of god, whom he entierly beſought, that Sennacherib myght be an example to all empyres and kyngedomes, that the onelye god of the Hebrues, was the trewe god. he hadde ſtrayght comforte. God ſayde vnto hym,
<pb facs="tcp:4494:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Sennacherib ſhall not come into the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Hieruſalem, he ſhall caſte no darte into it. &amp;c. The ſame nyght the aungelle of the lorde wente into the Aſſirians ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and ſlewe aboute an. C .lxxxviii. M. of them. Thus Sennacherib was fayne to retourne home ageyne, where prayeng to his Idolle, two of his owne ſonnes ſlewe hym.</p>
            <p>¶ In theſe exaumples, who ſeeth not, how ſtedfaſtly god ſtandeth with kinges that ſtande with hym, howe he ſtylle hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth, whan all mans helpe is paſte?

It is as Hieremie ſayth, Bleſſed is he, that putteth his truſt in the lord. God ſayth euen as moche by his prophete E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaye, I am the lorde, ſaythe he, who ſoo putteth his truſte in me, ſhall neuer be confounded.</p>
            <p>¶ What troubles ſuffered good Ioſue,

with his launce? Kynge Dauid wepte and wyſhed to haue boughte his ſonnes lyfe, with the loſſe of his owne. But god that beareth noo ſuche blynde affection, woll alowe no ſuch chaunge. The father forgaue his parte, god wolde in no wyſe remytte his. If dedes maye ſpeake, doo not ſo many exaumples, as we haue had a late, preach ſhameful death to all tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, to al rebels? Can any man thinke, but that Poole haſteneth a paſe, to that that goddis right iugement driueth hym vnto? Come not all they to theyr confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that come to ayde a traytour againſt his countrey, agaynſt religion, agaynſte god? Whom I praye you, can he brynge with him, but ſuche as Englyſhe men in tyme paſte haue hadde fayre days vpon? If they were wonte to leaue theyr owne countreys, at the commynge of a ſmalle Englyſhe hoſt, ſhal we al paſſe of a fewe of them? I haue hitherto handeled the matter, as though we were euen as that gay ambaſſatour reported vs: But now I wolle a lyttell ſhewe, what they haue wonne at our handes in tyme paſte, and
<pb facs="tcp:4494:18"/>
how we are now as able as euer we haue ben, to withſtande them, they neuer wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker than nowe, neuer leſſe able to inuade vs then nowe. for as our cauſe is able to enſtrengthen al weaknes, ſo is their qua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rell able to make weapons faule oute of the handes of men ſtrongeſte. We maye ſaye, our guyde is not oone, that beinge not called, toke this power vpon hym, he is our kynge, our ruler, by the wyll and ordinance of god, he is goddis miniſter, vnto whoſe charge god hath commytted this realme, the gouernement is his, by goddis appoyntment, our dueties, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey and ſerue him by goddes commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement. What may our enemies ſay, to comforte them in theyr vyage? we haue taken this iourneye, by the aduyſe of an arrant traytour, we haue a rebell to our capitayne, we go where god hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted vs nothynge to doo. Howe many mo thynges maye combre them? howe fewe put theym in harte to entre amonge vs? what nation canne come hyther, but we maye take our ſelfes, god beinge but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyfferente, abler to defende our realme,
<pb facs="tcp:4494:18"/>
thenne they to inuade it? I woll take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde of none of our owne cronicles. Let vs beleaue but our enemies, let it be true that they ſay? Maye we not haue better hartes to encounter with the proudeſt of them, than they to lande in our realme? Reade Froyſarte, a frenche wryter. who wolde almoſte thynke it poſſyble, that he wryteth of vs? It were ryghte expedient. that yonge Ientyll men dydde ofte reade theyr fathers noble actes, wherby vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedlye they may bothe be encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, to the like, and alſo know the weake<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of their enemys. We can not be worſe matched, then we haue ben, and that at ſondry tymes. We that then dyd ſo well, our quarell often tymes beinge but for a money matter, can we thynke now to do amyſſe, fyghtynge for the defence of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the reſtorynge of goddes worde, the mayntenaunce of goddes honour? Who can rede the battayle of Creſſy, and not conceyue wonderful hope of victory, whan we be any thynge egally matched? If noble Edwarde the thyrd, coude van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhe the frenche kynge, and almoſte al
<pb facs="tcp:4494:19"/>
the floure of Fraunce, they beinge, as theyr owne wryters teſtifie .viii. to oone of ours, what ſhal noble Henry the .viii. doo, whome god, by all wayes, ſeketh to enhaunce? Oughte not the battayle of Poyters to remaine freſhe in our memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, where an handfull of Engliſhe men ouerthrewe all the force of Fraunce? for as theyr ſtory ſayth, there durſt none tary from that fielde, but ſuche as neyther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded honour ne ſhame. The frenche kynge was taken there, and well nere al the nobles of Fraunce ſlayne. The bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle of Alroye in Britayne, maye not be forgotten, our countreye wanne there no ſmall honour. For albeit the frenche men &amp; Britons, ordered them ſelfe in theyr a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray wonderful prudently, &amp; in theyr fight verye manfully, yet were they all ſlayne, or dyſcomfyted. We haue alſo ſometyme ſoughte honour in Spayne, and founde it very fortunatly. Dyd not noble prynce Edwarde diſcomfet kynge Henriche, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper of the crowne of Spayne, van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyſhe there, bothe the frenche men and Spaniardes, and ſettle kynge Peter in
<pb facs="tcp:4494:19"/>
his right and roume ageine? Where dyd the hardye hartes and manly couragies of the Englyſhe men better appere, than in the battayle on the ſee before Sluſe in Flaunders? the fight was fierce and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, and our men ſore matched, for there were .iiii. of them to one englyſſhe man, and they very experte men of warre vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ſee. There was no place to flee, none to recule to, without loſſe of all. Here the noble Englyſhemen bare them ſelfe ſo valyantly, that they got the vyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, vtterly diſcomfetynge and ſleinge all the frenche men and Normans. We may forget the battayle of Agingcourt, but they woll remember and are lyke ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to forget, with howe ſmall an army, that moſt prudent and victorious kynge Henry the fyfte, vanquyſſhed that huge hoſt of french men. How moche to al our comfortes, may we reioyſe in the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the battayle, whiche moſt noble and vyctorious kynge Henry the eyghte, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the fielde <hi>Des eſprons,</hi> that is the fielde of ſpurres, bycauſe both the french men, as that daye, lefte all theyr defence, and
<pb facs="tcp:4494:20"/>
vſed nothynge but their ſpurres, fleinge one in an others necke, and we alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to vſe nothynge ſoo moche as our ſpurres, in purſuing them, that ſo ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fledde, in folowynge them, that in no caſe wolde abyde, in rydynge after them, that ſo faſt ran away? His hyghnes was than almoſt with al the nobilitie of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, yea with al the flowre and force of our nation in Fraunce: and yet the kyng of Scottes founde ynough at home, to defende lytel Englande. He came, whan our ſtrength was oute of the realme, he came vnloked for, with great prouiſyon, with a puiſant army. His chance might teache other pryncis, rather to gouerne well, that they haue, thanne to ſeke, that they can not come by. We that haue thus ben vſed to victories, ofte beaten our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, of what nation ſoo euer they be, can we now loke for leſſe than great and hygh honour at theyr handes? haue not they as good cauſe, to be afrayde of vs, of whome they haue receyued ſoo manye damages? as we to go with all courage ayenſt them, whom we haue ſo oft put to
<pb facs="tcp:4494:20"/>
flyght, ſo ofte ſhamed, ſo ofte put to the worſe? had we then ſtomackes, &amp; ſhal we lacke now? had we than cauſe to do vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly, and fynde we none now? was there euer prince, that dyd, or coulde better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde the ſeruyce of his ſubiectes, than our moſte bountifull ſoueraygne? haue not all we, that be Sotherne men, good cauſe to ſhewe our ſelfe harty, courragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, valyaunte, ſeinge that we knowe, the Northen men, woll do what they can, to make a large mendes, for theyr laate faute? I doubt not, but they haue moche deſyred, ſome ſuche occaſyon, to teſtyfye their hartes and fydelytie, to the kynges hyghnes. They haue ſene, howe mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully his grace gaue theym theyr lyues, whiche the lawes chalenged as forfayte and loſte. We may all truſte, they wolle well declare to his hyghneſſe, that he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lente them lyues, than gaue them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. And that they haue them in ſtore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to render theym, whan ſo euer his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure, his cauſe, his commandemente, ſhall require theym. They beinge thus ſet, can we Sothern men, come any fote
<pb facs="tcp:4494:21"/>
behynde them? Shall they be gladder to wype away ſuche blemyſhe, as tell vpon them, by the crafty ſeducemente of ſuche as are nowe worthyly deade, than we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrefull, to encreaſe his gracis beneuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence towarde vs? I truſt, as we be one realme, ſo our enemies ſhall fynde vs of one harte, one fydelitie, one allegiance. As god helpe me, euen in the tyme of the inſurrection, I halfe wyſhed, that ſome our enemies had ſet vpon vs. I dyd not alone lament, that whan bothe parties were ſo furnyſhed to battayle, there was ſo vnmete a matche, for men to ſhew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelfe hardy. I had red, and ofte remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the wyſe anſwere of Scorio to his ſouldiours. His hoſte harde that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains were at diſſention, and wolde ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des haue hadde hym, to ſet vpon theym, whyle they were ſoo at variance. Naye, not ſo, ſayth Scorio, this were euen the nexte waye to make theym agreed. And whan his ſouldiors, wolde make no ende of deſyrynge him to go towardes Rome, he cauſed a couple of maſtiues to be ſette to gether by the eares, and euen whanne
<pb facs="tcp:4494:21"/>
they were hardeſt at it, he in the ſyght of all his hoſte, ſhewed vnto the dogges a wolfe, whiche as ſoone as the dogges ſawe, they ſtraight way, were at one, and both folowed the wolfe. Men ofte tymes fayle of theyr purpoſe, and turne thinges quyte contrarye to that they intended. There was a good wyfe, for ſoo we call them that be maryed, whiche beinge ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wery of her huſband, thoughte to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patche hym by poyſon. This woman a frayde, leſte one poyſon wolde not ſerue her torne, toke two, thynkynge ſhe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhoulde quyckelye and ſpedelye haue wroughte her feate. She was deceyued, for where thone poyſon alone had ſlayne hym, the ſtryfe of the one with the other ſaued hym alyue. If her cruelty had ben leſſe, ſhe had ſurely broughte her purpoſe to effecte. Poyſon hath put me in minde, here to tell a ſtory done in our tyme, not longe ſythens, by a noble man of Rome. I ſhall lyttell digreſſe from my purpoſe, for ye maye alſo lerne by this ſtorye, that men ofte tymes haue great hurte, where they loke for great pleaſure. There is in
<pb facs="tcp:4494:22"/>
Italye a ientil man, whome for his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and noble qualities, the holy college of Cardinals, by intretie of Paule theyr byſſhoppe, haue made capyteyne of the churche: his name is Petrus Aloiſius, a braunche commen of a good ſtocke, as ye ſhal wel perceiue by his fruites. This great capitayne, by chaunce had to paſſe by the byſhoppe of Phanes houſe. The byſhoppe hearynge of this, and glad he had occaſion gyuen hym, to offer kynde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes vnto ſuche an eſtate, mette ſignior Petro Aloiſio, and offerid him his houſe. The capytayne of the Romyſhe churche, was lyghtly perſuaded, to lodge with the byſhop. the byſſhop interteyned hym, as hyghely as he coulde deuyſe. ſparynge neyther labour, in prouydynge all ſuche deynties as myghte make his chere the better, ne coſt in dreſſyng of them. Whan ſupper and bankets were done, the time of reſte well paſte forthe, the byſſhoppe brought his gueſt to his chambre, where he deſyred hym of pardon, that his chere was noo better, truſtynge thoughe there were nothynge mete for ſuche a perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb facs="tcp:4494:22"/>
interteynment, that yet he wolde ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte his good harte and wylle, whiche fayne wold his fare had ben higher, and is moche ſory it was not ſo. And there he made hym the courteyſe offer of the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyan, deſyrynge hym, if there were any thynge in all his houſe, that his phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie ſtode to, that he wolde thynke it his owne, and ſo to take it. And that he, his body, his harte, and all his, was at ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior Aloiſius commandement. I knewe the byſſhoppe wonderfull well: he was vndoubted, as well lerned a yonge man, as fewe were in Italy. His ſtyle ſo pure, he in writynge ſo elegante and eloquent, that I dare ſaye, there were not .x. in all Italye, not two of his age, that coulde matche hym. The capytayne, after the byſſhop had bydden hym good nyghte, called .iii. or .iiii. of his men to hym, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge them all of the byſſhops offer, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge, I lyke well this parte of the offer, that his body is at my commandemente, I intende to morowe in the mornynge to proue, whether he be a man of his worde or noo. If I canne not obteyne by fayre
<pb facs="tcp:4494:23"/>
meanes, I intende to vſe your helpe, and haue it by force. Wherfore be not farre of at his commynge hyther. The byſſhop came in the mornyng, to gyue hym good morowe, he dyd ſo. The capitayne than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked hym moche for all his kyndnes, and moſte of all, that he hadde made hym the nyghte before ſo ample an offer, ſaying, thoughe there be manye thynges here, which I fanſy wel, yet I purpoſe to take that parte of your offer, where ye ſayde your perſon is at my commaundemente. Certes I woll ſeaſe vpon that, and leaue all other thynges to you. The byſſhoppe ſore aſtonied, knew what his abomyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble demaunde ment. and ſayde: Syr I knowe ye can lyttell fanſye, thynges ſoo fylthy, myne age maketh your wiſedome to attempte me, therby to haue a profe of myne honeſtie. No <hi>Sangue di dio,</hi> ſayth the capitayne, I meane erneſt, and I praye you ſo take it. The biſhop nowe no more aſtonyed, but euen hart angry, made him a ſharpe anſwere. Syr ſayth he, thoughe I haue not made you ſuche chere, as I wolde, yet haue I made you as good as
<pb facs="tcp:4494:23"/>
I coulde haue done, thoughe the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour had ben in my howſe. for ſuche my good wyll, I lytel thought ye wold haue offered me ſo great vylanye, and in myne owne houſe. but ſet your harte at reſt, I woll be torne in peces, rather than you, or any lyuyng creature, ſhal make me wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyngly to fall into ſo brute and vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall a ſynne. What trowe ye the capitayn dyd here? lyke a capitayn of that churche I warrant you. His men were at hande, whiche enforced the byſhop, ſpite of all his ſtriuinge, to kepe his promyſe. How happy is Aloiſius, that hathe ſuche fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, as none his aduerſarie dare charge hym withal? a thynge to be wondred at, men can not tel without ſhame, that they do nothynge aſhamed of. The byſſhop ſayd, Sodom &amp; Gomorra ſunke for this ſynne, woll god ſe it euer vnpunyſhed in the? though god differ punyſhment, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendyng them peyne euerlaſting, whoſe offences are greatter than any punyſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t here may be thought mete for them, woll not the emperour one day ſe lawes made for ſuch ſyn executed? I truſte to ſe
<pb facs="tcp:4494:24"/>
his maieſtie, er it be longe, I truſte to be harde, and nothynge doubt, but he woll ſe this vltrage, this vylanye, that thou haſte done me, puniſhed. I woll make an ende of ſoo fylthye a matter, and trouble honeſt eares no lengar. This capitayne of the churche, prouyded ſo, that within iiii. or .v. days after, the byſhop was poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned. Wold ye not think this graffe cam of good ſyre? his mother was broughte a bed, longe er ſhe were maried, and his father is nowe byſhop of Rome. Trowe ye, the churche of Rome, wherof ſuche a father is the heade, ſuche a ſonne the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitain, is not a dere darling vnto Chriſt? Wolde he let her be gouerned of the one, defended of the other, if he loued her not excedyngely? Dothe not god rather ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monyſhe all princis, howe lyttell he ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth by this ſtrompet of Babylon, whom he hath left in ſuche mens handes? Here I muſt nedes tell, that that I haue hard Reynolde Pole, the Cardinall ofte ſaye, and not I alone, but many mo, whom I can name, men of honeſte credyte. This Pole, than a perle of his contrey, nowe, a
<pb facs="tcp:4494:24"/>
foule pocke to it, wente to Rome at his fyrſt beynge in Italy, thynkynge to haue leyne there halfe a yere or more. God let me neuer ſpeake, ne wryte after this day, If he hath not ſayde, and that very ofte, where I haue ben in preſence, that whan he had ben there .iii. or .iiii. dayes, and ſeen the abhomynation of the cardinals, byſhops, and other theyr offycers, with the deteſtable vices of that citie, he could in no wyſe tary there any le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger. He could not than abyde .v. dayes in Rome. and now, Ambition be thanked, he hath this always in his mouthe, <hi>Roma mihi patria eſt,</hi> Rome is my natiue countreye. Hath not Rome a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfull vertue in it, that thus ſone can brynge men at one with vyce, in loue with ſynne and abhomynation? If he a traytour, forſaketh his countreye, changeth Englande for Rome, fyghting for them, ayenſte vs, ſhall we not ſtycke to our countrey, not fight ayenſt al men, in defence of Englande? They thynke to worke vs moche diſpleaſure. they maye chance to make the rodde for vs, and we to beate them. Aman ſet vppe a peyer of
<pb facs="tcp:4494:25"/>
gallowes, to hange Mardocheus vpon: Mardocheus euen by that occaſion was made nexte vnto the kynge in honour, and Aman truſte vppe. There is a prety greke Epigram, whiche ſaythe, A poore felawe, beinge in great neceſſitie, moche troubeled for lacke of pence, gat hym an halter, and thoughte therewith to haue made an ende of his myſery. by chaunce, as he ſought a tree, he founde an hourde of money. councell here he neaded none, to perſuade him to chaunge his purpoſe. No, he forthwith layde the halter where he founde the money. But he that hadde lodged his treaſure there, not longe after commynge thyther, and finding it gone, and an halter at hande, thoughte the vſe of his money paſte hym, and ſo vſed the halter. The byſſhop of Rome thynketh to haue a great pray here, The cardinall thynketh ſo to, they may chaunce to ſeke hurdes, and fynde halters. They truſte by this vyage, to wynne theyr ſpurres, perchance they may loſe theyr bootes to. At the beginnynge, who coulde thynke, but the laſle commotion wold haue done
<pb facs="tcp:4494:25"/>
excedynge moche hurt to England? God euer be thanked, we could ſcaſe haue wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed it better. aſſuredly, we myght won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous euyll haue lacked it. Mo exaum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples myghte be broughte, but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge of this trayterouſe cardynall, the commodities that I truſte woll enſue of it, ſhall make vs myſtruſt fewe thynges hereafter, excepte we become chaunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynges, and for a tryfle leaue that we haue hitherto godly folowed. The diuell in an other worlde myght playe hym, He had men inough, that wrought for hym, he then was at reſt, but no we he ſeeth his kyngdome is aſſauted, and that he muſt either loſe a great portion of his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or els in tyme beſturre hym. he hateth alwayes good princis and magiſtrates, neuer ceaſſynge to ſtyrre vp ſedition vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them, to brynge in ennemies, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupte that they go aboute. It is verye tru, that ſaynt Cyprian ſaith, The deuyl, Chriſtis aduerſarie, beſiegeth no tentes ſo ſone, pitcheth battayle with none ſoo ſoone, as with the ſouldiours of Chriſt. Men in errours, men drowned in luſtes,
<pb facs="tcp:4494:26"/>
in noughtyneſſe, after he hath throwen them downe, and made them full his, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temneth and paſſeth by them, nothyng a frayde leſte they ſtarte. But thoſe he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kethe to hurle downe, whome he ſeeth ſtonde faſt. Wherfore, ſeinge no men are more troubled, none ofter aſſauted with greater perils, then they that intende to do truely the office of Chriſten magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, it is excedynge nedefull, that a kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges reaſon, power, harte, and mynde be well defended with the ſhielde of goddes worde, with affyaunce in his promyſes, that therby he may ſtande ſure, ayenſt all ſtormes of this world, ayenſte all ſurges of frownynge fortune, ayenſte al violent force, not onely of men, but of dyuelles. God be prayſed, we haue a prynce of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible courage, whoſe hart god hath ſo enuironed with his graces, ſo furniſſhed with his giftes, ſo ſtrengthened with the aſſured affyaunce of his promyſes, that he wol venture al thynge rather then the loſſe of his ſubiectes ſowles.

to be taken out of his realme. His high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes woll in no caſe, his ſubiectes commit any fornication hereafter with that abho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>minable hore, which hitherto theſe many yeres, hath ſouſed al kyngedomes in the dragges of Idolatry, of Hypocriſie, of al errours. His grace wol, their lowſy mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes vtter no more of their broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ware among vs. And as his highnes wol our ſoules be out of peryll, ſoo I praye you, what kynge, ſythens kynges ruled fyrſte this realme of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, hath made grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prouiſion for the ſaftie of our bodies? Is it poſſible, that any his gracis ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte, can refuſe peyne, whan his hygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes rydeth about from hauen to hauen, from caſtell to caſtell, dayes and nightes deuyſynge all the wayes, that wytte can inuent, for our aſſuraunce? What char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges is his grace at, for the fortifienge of Caleys, Hammis, Guyſnes, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payring of Douer hauen, Douer caſtel, for building bulwarkes in the Downes, bulwarkes at Folkeſtone. What a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme woll Englande be, whan his grace hath ſet walles, accordinge to the diches,

that runne rounde aboute vs? England wol than be moch liker a caſtel, than a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme. His grace hath deuiſed a bulwark in the Camber, a bulwark at Calſhottes poynte, a bulwarke at the Eaſte cowe, a bulwarke at the Weſt cow. His highnes fortifieth Portiſmouth, Southampton, Weymouth, Portland rode, Torre baye, Plymmouthe hauen, Dermouth hauen, Falmouth hauen. This ones done, what enemy, be he neuer ſo ſtrong, wol thinke, he can inuade England on thoſe parties of it? Now, that ye may know, his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe careth for all, and not for ſome, he fortifyeth Barwycke, bothe towne and caſtelle, Carliel, towne and caſtel, ſetting men a worke for the repayring of Warke caſtell, Bambrough caſtell, Alnwicke ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtel, Scarborowe caſtell, Powmfret ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell, fortifieng alſo Kyngſton vpon Hul, Grimiſbye vppon Humber.

If his highnes thus diligentely watche, that we maye ſafely ſlepe, ſpend his treaſure thus largely, that we maye ſurely kepe our goodes, were it not our great ſhame, to ſuffer his highnes to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile alone? Is it not our partes, in this oone thynge, euen to contende with his grace, that is, to loue his honour, his proſperytie, more than he canne loue our welth &amp; ſafetie? We might, yea we ought to ſtryue with his grace, and to deſire to ouercome hym, in louynge our contreye. and his highnes goinge before, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Englande, can we tary behinde? Where his highnes is contente to ſpende all his treaſure, content to venture hym ſelfe for our ſaftie, can we be ſo vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, as not to acknowlege ſuche good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of our ſoueraygne? can we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege it, and not thynke our ſelues bound to ſpende bodyes, goodes, for his hygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes preſeruation, thoughe we ſhulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb facs="tcp:4494:28"/>
therby none other commoditie? can we beinge in moſte ieoperdie our ſelues, not beſturre vs? Were it not our vtter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, that his highnes ſhuld loue vs bet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we our ſelues? we muſt not think, that we fight with ennemies, which wol be content with victorie, if they gette the ouer hande of vs: they ſeke our bloude, they couet our deſtruction, &amp; if they ſpare ſome, yet the ſacke, the ſpoyle ſhall touch all men. The turke ſuffereth men, taken in warre, to kepe theyr religion, to ſerue god, as his lawes woll. The byſſhop of Rome, moch crueller then Turke or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thinketh his victory worth nothing, except he ouerthrowe goddes worde, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he driue out ryght religion, except he vtterly bannyſhe Chriſte. Honour is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vs, and ſuche honour vndoubtedly as neuer came to our nation, if we luſt to take it. I woll ende with a propheſie, not lately commen out of wales, but founde in ſcripture, in the .iiii. boke of Eſdras. There is mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made of a proude Egle, that ſo moche toke vpon her, that al prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, all kyngdomes were troden vnder
<pb facs="tcp:4494:28"/>
her fete. What and whom this Egle figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, we can not doubte, if we wol beleue goddes owne expoſycion. It ſygnyfieth ſayth he, the ſame kyngedome, that Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel ſawe in his viſyon, whiche was the kyngdome of Antichriſte, the reigne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly of the byſhoppe of Rome. All thynges ſpoken here of the Egle, agree with hym as iuſt as may be. This byrde. ſayth the texte, made al the erth afrayde, al men trembled, at her ſyght, all thynge became ſubiecte to it, no man, a long ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo hardy, as to gaine ſay her. But at the laſte ſaythe Eſdras, <hi>Ecce Leo, concitatus de ſylua rugiens,</hi> Loo, there came out of a woode a Lion a gret paſe, roring a lowd, and ſayde to this ſaucye and myſproude Egle, I woll ſpeake with the, the lorde hath to ſay to the, and woll ſay thus, Art not thou he, that haſt ouercome the other my creatures, whiche I wolde haue had reigned in my worlde? Arte not thou he, that haſt ruled the worlde in moche feare and tremblyng, holdinge it in naughtieſt labour, in workes moſte fonde, dwellyng in all partes of the erth, by deceyte crafte
<pb facs="tcp:4494:29"/>
and treachery? Art not thou he, that haſt iudged the erth, <hi>non in ueritate,</hi> in falſhode, not in truthe? Thou haſte troubled the mylde ſorte, and hurte theym that loued quietnes, peace, and reſt, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſought and taught the eaſe of troubeled co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Thou haſt loued lyers, and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the habitations of them, that brought forth good fruite, ſettynge idle and drane bees in theyr places. Thy ſpitefull hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge of the worlde, the contumely thou diddeſte vnto all princes, is aſcended vp euen to the ſyghte of the hygheſte. Thy pryde is ſene. God hath loked vpon this proude tyme, and Lo, ſaythe this coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Lion, his tyme is at an ende, the miſchefes of this Egle are almooſte at a poynte. Wherfore, ſaythe the Lion, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere thou noo more Egle, neyther thyne horrible winges, nor thy miſcheuous he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, nor thy rauenyng clawes, ne thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy whiche is holly compacte of vanities, al vayne, the Lorde cryeth to the, Alway: the Lion, hauynge a mans voyce, as the texte ſayth, byddeth the trudge, and why? the cauſe ſtraight foloweth, <hi>That thou ones</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:4494:29"/>
               <hi>gone,</hi> the erthe may be refreſhed: that thy kyngedome ones fallen, men may turne ageyne to freedome, delyuered from thy vyolent power: that thy baggage caſte out of mens hartes, they maye hope, to receyue his iugement, his mercy, whiche made the erthe, and al the dwellers vpon it. While the luſty Lion ſpake theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, the heed of the Egle began to ſtand a wrye, the winges were no more ſene, her kyngedome waxed weake, feble, full of trauayle, tumulte, and buſyneſſe, moch a do to kepe it on fote, all the Egles bodye was ſet a fyre.</p>
            <p>¶That prowde Rome is mente by this prowde Egle, the texte is playne, the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtaunces are ſuche, that thoughe it were in doubte, we myght eaſyly applye the Egle to the Romyſhe byſhop, and to none other. Nowe by the Lyon, who is ment, the texte ſayth nothynge. What if I contende, noble <hi>HENRY</hi> the. <hi>VIII.</hi> to be this Lyon? May I not haue many coniectures, to leade me this way? many thynges euen taken of the ſame place, to make other men thinke ſo to? Fyrſte, as
<pb facs="tcp:4494:30"/>
the Egle hath always ben the Romains badge, ſo hath kynges of Englande euer more gyuen the Lyon in their armes: ſo that it can ſo welle be applied to none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prince. The Venetians gyue the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but their Lyon commeth not oute of the wodde, but oute of the water. They dwell in water, our Lyon fetcheth all his force nexte vnto god, out of the woddes, our bowes, our arrowes, are fetched oute of the woddes. Our Lyon, whan he ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth towarde his enemies, wel declareth to them, that he cometh frome the wood. But to go ſomewhat nygher to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: Who hathe tolde the rauenynge Egle, this terryble tydynges? Who but <hi>HENRY</hi> the <hi>VIII.</hi> our noble and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious Lion? This Lion, ſaith the text, is a wynde, whyche the lorde hath kepte in ſtore, for theſe later days, bothe to toſſe the Egle and her byrdes, and alſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhe, refrigerate, and comfort our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, that ſo longe a ſeaſon haue la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured, panted, and boyled in fynne, ſtyl in feare of hel. Hath not our noble king, with ſondry blaſtes of the ſpirite of god,
<pb facs="tcp:4494:30"/>
all to rent this popyſhe power? al to ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his neſte? his ſeate? his high trone? this wynde hath hurled ſuche duſte into the Egles eyes, that her heed begynneth to waxe gyddy, her wynges to cary her, ſhe woteth not whither, her clawes, to let fall ſuche prayes, as ſhe thought to haue brought to her neſt. This wynde, our lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des prayſe be it, hath blowen vs oute of this cruell Egles reache, we fele no more her ſharpe talendes, whiche in time paſt, ſo griped our hartes, ſo ſeaſoned vppon our ſoules. Our countreye is refreſhed, our hope fyxed in the iudgemente of the lorde, our affiaunce ſette faſte in goddis mercy. Hath not our couragious Lyon, our pleaſant wynde, blowen vp a blaſt, that refreſhed vs all, whan he by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, by his proclamations, brake the cheynes, that our ſoules laye tyed in, ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues and bond to Romiſhe tyranny? Cam there not a gay cole to our hartes, whan our Lyon ſayd, <hi>Hens proude Egle, appere no more here in Englande?</hi> Went there not ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry great lumpes of heuynes from oure hartes, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we that were wont to dreade
<pb facs="tcp:4494:31"/>
nothyng ſo moche, as the myſprowde iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemente of the Egle, begunne to refuſe mercy and forgyuenes at his hande, and to ſeke it of hym, whiche made vs, and is mercy it ſelfe, and the onely forgyuer of ſynnes? Is not this a ſwete breathe, that our Wynde powreth vppon vs all? Be not theſe pleaſant blaſtes? This wynde is cited to aryſe, cyted by hym, that ruleth all wyndes, in the .iiii. chapyter of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica canticorum, by theſe wordes, Vppe thou north wynde, blowe vpon my gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyn, that the ſmell therof may be caried on all ſydes, that my derely beloued may come thither, and eate of the fruites, that growe therin. Is not our wynde vp, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordynge to his call, hath not he wel bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted his commiſſion abrode? hath not he tolde the Egle of her rauenynge? of her ſpoyle, and ſlaughter? If he hathe done thus, and no prynce but he, why may not we thinke, that noble <hi>HENRY</hi> the <hi>VIII</hi> is the Lyon, the wynde ordeyned &amp; ſente by god, to toſſe this wycked tyraunte of Rome, to blowe him out of al chriſten re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions? Se ye not, to what honour god
<pb facs="tcp:4494:31"/>
calleth our nation? may not we reioyce, that god hath choſen our kyng, to worke ſo noble a feate? God ſayth, a Lion ſhall teare this tira<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes auctorite in peces. God ſayth, a wynde ſhal ſhake hym out of his cheyer: ſhall we not thynke, this Lyon, this wynde, to be our ſoueraygne, our kynge, Whiche firſte of all princes, durſt take hym by the boſome? Let this yelling Egle approche towarde vs, let her come with all her byrdes about her, let a tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour cary her ſtandard: doth not god ſay, her wynges ſhall be cut, her kyngedome waxe feble, the Lyon waxe ſtronge, and ſaue the reſidue of goddes people, filling them full of ioye and comfort, euen while the worlde endureth. Let vs, let vs ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore worke luſtely nowe, we ſhall play for euer hereafter. Let vs fight this one fielde with englyſſhe han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and englyſſhe hartes, perpetuall quietnes, reſt, peace, victorie, honour, welthe, all is owers. <g ref="char:leaf">❧</g>
