            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Honorable Aſſembly of Commons in houſe of Parliament.</head>
            <head type="sub">The humble Petition of the Waggoners or Carriers of the Cities of <hi>Oxford, Cambridge, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich, Colcheſter, Northhampton,</hi> and other Townes and places within this Realme. And alſo of the Clothiers and Tradeſ-men vſing traffique and commerce in the ſaid Townes and places.</head>
            <opener>Humbly ſhewing,</opener>
            <p>THat the Kings Maieſties Proclamation giuen at <hi>Winſor</hi> the ſixt day of Auguſt in the twentith yeare of his Highneſſe moſt happie Reigne ouer vs of this his Realme of <hi>England,</hi> hereunto annezed, is a great hindrance and grieuance to your Petitioners; for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe whereof your Petitioners about February laſt was twelue moneths, did moſt humbly petition the Kings moſt excellent Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, who thereupon was graciouſly pleaſed to refer your Petitioners ſaid grieuance to the conſideration of the Lords of his Highnes moſt honorable Priuie Councell, vnto whom your Petitioners repairing with his Maieſties ſaid gracious reference, their Honours being buſied with more important affaires, had no leiſure to conſider thereof, and ſo did nothing therein.</p>
            <p>Wherefore your humble Petitioners being ſtill moleſted and troubled by vertue of the ſaid Proclamation if they go with their ſaid Waggons, doe moſt humbly pray and beſeech this honorable Aſſembly to receiue this their Petition into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and to reade their grieuances and allegations hereafter following, importing both a neceſſitie and conueniencie that Waggons with foure wheeles ſhould rather be in vſe then Carts with two wheeles; And to be a meanes that the ſaid Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation may be called in, and they at libertie to vſe their Waggons with foure wheeles as in former times, not carrying aboue twentie hundred weight the ſix moneths in the Winter ſeaſon; And they ſhall dayly pray, &amp;c.</p>
            <list>
               <head>Their Allegations.</head>
               <item>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, a Waggon or Drug hauing foure wheeles will ſeldome or neuer ouerthrow (whatſoeuer his loading be) becauſe when one of the wheeles doth riſe, the other doth incontinently pull him downe againe, and by that meanes the paſſengers and goods that are therein, and alſo the Driuer, are in ſafetie.</p>
                  <p>Where on the contrary, a Cart with two wheeles will very often (inevitably) ouerthrow, and in ouerthrowing indanger the liues of the Paſſengers, if any be therein, and ſpoile, hurt and ſoyle the goods, to the loſſe of the owners market.</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <p n="2">2. A waggon by reaſon of ſuch his ſecure trauell, doth make more ſpeed on the way then a Cart, and is ſooner at his iourneys end, and therefore ſeldome or neuer much benighted.</p>
                  <p>Where on the contrary a Cart (for feare of being ouerthrowne) cannot make ſuch ſpeed, and ſo is inforced to trauell late in the night to accompliſh his accuſtomed iourneys, to the exceeding toyle and danger of the Carter.</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <p n="3">3. By the convoy of waggons, many Paſſengers, both men, women and children, aged, lame and impotent perſons are carried to and fro, from place to place, as their occaſions driues them, drie and ſafe, and that for a ſmall charge, which otherwiſe could not ride on horſebacke, or trauell on foote, to the great eaſe and benefit of many of the Kings ſubiects, and profit to your Petitioners the Waggoners.</p>
                  <p>Where on the contrary, not any can be ſo convoyed in Carts, without great perill and danger of their liues, by reaſon of ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing, whereof there hath been lamentable examples of certaine perſons killed neare <hi>Ingerſtone,</hi> to the griefe of the ſubiect, and loſſe to the Waggoner.</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <p n="4">4. A waggon may be guided by a ſlight and engine downe any ſteepe hill.</p>
                  <p>Where on the contrary a Cart cannot, and therefore is not fit for trauell in all places.</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <p n="5">5. If a waggon be ſet faſt in a mire-pit, the ſame is with leſſe ſtrength drawne forth with the motion of foure wheeles, then a Cart can be with two wheeles.</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <p n="6">6. A waggon with foure wheeles hauing a loade of thirtie hundred weight laid vpon the ſame, will make a leſſer cut or impreſſion in the ground then a Cart with two wheeles, hauing but twentie hundred weight; and the reaſon is, becauſe the thirtie hundred weight lying vpon the foure wheeles, viz. ſeuen hundred and a halfe vpon a wheele, and the Carts two wheeles bearing ten hundred vpon a wheele, the weight of ten hundred vpon a wheele doth cut and ſinke deeper in the ground then ſeuen hundred and a halfe.</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <p n="7">7. A Cart will be driuen and turned aſide euery way, and ſo ſearch out and run ouer the whole compaſſe of the wayes, and often times in turning ſhort, doth make ſuch a ſlough or cut in the ground, that a loade of ſtones will ſcarce fill vp the ſame pit againe.</p>
                  <p>Where on the contrary, a Waggon cannot turne out of the way, but go ſtraight outright.</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <p n="8">8. It is a hinderance to the Waggoner, and almoſt a double charge to the Merchant or tradeſ-men vſing cariage, that the Waggoner is reſtrained and limited by the ſaid Proclamation, that he may not carrie no greater loades in the Summer time, when the wayes are impreſſible, then in the Winter ſeaſon, when they are almoſt impaſſible.</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <p n="9">9. For that ſince the ceſſation of Waggons with foure wheeles, and recourſe of Carts onely with two wheeles, experience ſhewes it to be true, that the roade wayes are neuer a iot bettered or preſerued, but rather worſer and impaired: therefore and for the reaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, your Petitioners do humbly pray as they haue prayed.</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <p>Laſtly, the cauſe of the foulneſſe and badneſſe of the high wayes, is not cauſed through the recourſe of Carts and Waggons, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the Common wealth cannot be, but for lacke of due amending and repairing in the moſt needfull places in times con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient.</p>
