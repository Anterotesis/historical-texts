            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was ordered by a Divine hand, that I should Preach before you in <hi>Windsor</hi> Castle, at your very first marching forth with this successe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Army, at which time I treated (from <hi>Psal. 60.10</hi>) of Gods marching forth with <hi>Israels</hi> Army, the footsteps of whose pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence hath been seen within your Campe: By the same hand it was likewise ordered, that I should preach in your presence, the very first Fast day after your returne to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> as a Conqueror; at which time I had a faire occasion to presse, <hi>That such who had bin serviceable to the Church of God in its necessitous condition, ought from those they doe assist to have a requitall,</hi> in which I know none deserves a greater share then your Excellency. Great Generall, I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to make my humble and particular addresse, in dedicating these few lines to your Excellency upon a double ground: <hi>1.</hi> To take off a malicious mis-construction, which some made of what I delivered, laying my words on the rack of a tortured mis-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, forcing them to speake what I never meant, as if in some passages of my Sermon, I had some reflections on your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Selfe; whereas I can appeale to Heaven, I had rather my tongue should cleave to the roof of my mouth, then that a thought should be in my heart, or a word drop from between my lips, to darken that glory which God hath cast upon you. 'Tis true in
<pb facs="tcp:36298:3"/>
handling this Doctrine, <hi>That such who are serviceable to the people of God in their necessitous condition, ought from those they do assist, to have a requitall, and to be sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers with them in their mercies,</hi> Lest there should bee an ill use made thereof, as if the requitall of men for their service should be so far extended, as that they must be indulged in their evils, I was forced, to prevent this mistake, to lay down this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, viz. <hi>That the requitall of men for their good service, must not extend so far as to tolerate them in their evills.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Gainas <hi>being addicted to the</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian <hi>Heresie, petitioned</hi> Arcadius <hi>the Emperor, that he might have favor, within his Territories, to have a Church for the publike exercise of</hi> Arianisme, <hi>making this the ground of his request, That he had done him great service, and gotten great victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for the</hi> Romans; <hi>yet</hi> Arcadius <hi>the Emperour denyed his request</hi> (<hi>upon the advice of</hi> Chrysostome,) <hi>and although</hi> Gain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note> In exemplifying which caution, I gave this supposition, <hi>Suppose a Commander, (who hath been valiant and faithfull in your most successefull and serviceable Army) should run into damnable Heresies, to deny the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of Christ, the Immortality of the soul, the authority of the Scriptures, though his valour and fidelity pleads for a requitall for his Service, yet not for a toleration in these opinions.</hi> Now they who wrest these words as if they reflected on your Excellency, doe you infinitely more wrong, then they doe to so meane an one as I am that spake those words; such who apply those words to your Excellency, what doe they bat lay you under cond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>mnation, as if you denyed the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie of Christ, the Immortality of the Soule, or Authority of the Scriptures, which thoughts are farre from your Noble breast; your moderation is knowne to all men, and the soundnesse of your judgement touching this matter; yea, which is your glory, that notwithstanding the cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>shing controversies of the times, you have still pursued your duty, and not cleaved unto Parties. There was another passage in the Sermon which some wrested, as if I aimed at your Excellency. In the close of the caution I made use of a Story out of <hi>Plutarchs Moralls,</hi> of one <hi>Manlius,</hi> who being to wage War with the <hi>Samnites,</hi> hee being to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
<pb facs="tcp:36298:3"/>
from the Army for a while, left his Sonne to command in chiefe, with this charge, that he should not give the <hi>Samnites</hi> battail, without speciall Order from him; his Sonne seeing a faire opportunity against the Enemie, gave them battaile, fought valiantly, and got the victory: returning to his Father a Conquerour, told him what he had done; his Father did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him for his valour, yet told him hee should lose his head for his disobedience. I onely intended the Story to this end, To shew that Heathens observed this rule, to gratifie men for their services, yet were so just they would punish them for their evils: Now they that apply this Story to your Excellency, what doe they lesse then charge you of disobedience to the State you serve? which malice it selfe cannot fasten upon you. There is one thing more I would cleere my selfe in your thoughts, <hi>viz.</hi> from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just aspersion that Master <hi>Dell</hi> casts upon me in his Epistle De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory, as if I preacht against the Articles at <hi>Oxford</hi>; I had thought I did so cleerly expresse my self in that matter, that none would have been so shamelesse as to lay such a thing to my charge, when I desired the Honourable Worthies of Parliament to cast their eyes on the University of <hi>Oxford</hi> to reform it your Excellency very well knows, I did premise this clause, that in what I should say, I would no waies reflect on the Articles at <hi>Oxford,</hi> which being made, stands with the Honour and Iustice of the Parliament to have them kept; how unjustly then doth Master <hi>Dell</hi> censure me? This is the first ground of my humble addresse to your Excellency, that I might be <hi>rectus in curia,</hi> cleare in your noble thoughts. The second ground is this, To leave it to your Excellencies thoughts, whether so dangerous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an opinionated a man as Master <hi>Dell</hi> is, is fit to be a Chaplain in your Army, who saith, That if the Assembly should condemne the Doctrines he preacht, they were the enemies of the truth of Christ, and the last prop of Antichrist in the Kingdom: Yea, he saith further that the worke of Reformation so much desired by the Orthodox and godly Presbyterian Ministers and people, <hi>Is

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He distractions and divisions of the times (increased by fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious spirits venting their luxuriant opinions) threaten sad things; as if God hath a controversie with the Land, and is writing bitter things against it; or, as if the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles we have hitherto undergone, were but the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our sorrows: <hi>Fox</hi>

I can appeale to heaven, I delight not in bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse, and breaches among brethren; I had rather bring water to quench, then oyle to increase the flame that is kindled among us; I could wish with <hi>Jonah</hi> I were cast into the Sea, so that the boyste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous storms arisen among us might be allayed thereby; or with <hi>Curtius</hi> (who did cast himself into the <hi>Chasma</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> that so the breach might be made up and the City not indangered) cast my self into the breach, if so be I could but stop it. I acknowledge to God and the world, I am so sensible of my own infirmities that I would bring nothing into the Presse, but that I am prest thereunto, lest the Truth and my Integrity should suffer by my silence. The truth is, had not Mr. <hi>Dell</hi> discovered such confidence and boldnesse in delivering so many unsound and erroneous tenets, I had not exprest a word of dislike in the Pulpit, and had hee not since Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Sermon with his Reply (and that without order) I should
<pb facs="tcp:36298:5"/>
not have gainesaid him now in the Presse, as I did then in the Pulpit.</p>
            <p>Before I begin to take notice of any clause in his Sermon in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, I shall advertise the Reader about this in generall, that (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though as it is Printed, it is justly to be excepted against, yet) he left out some materiall passages he did preach, and inserted what he did not; so that I may say Mr. <hi>Dell</hi> dealt with his Sermon as <hi>Apelles</hi> the Painter did with <hi>Antigonus,</hi> who painted that part of his face which was comely, but hid most of his deformities. I shall now addresse my self to give innocent touches on severall unsound passages in his Sermon. In the managing whereof I shall indevour that my pen drop honey, not vineger, reason against his opinions, not railing against his person. In the first place I cannot but take notice how unhappy my mistaken brother was in the expounding of his Text, which was,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr. Dell</hi> is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding his Text.</note> 
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10. <hi>Vntil the time of Reformation.</hi> Now this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation he described to be <hi>The mortifying and destroying and utter abolishing out of the faithfull and elect, all that sin, lust, corruption, that did flow in upon them by the fall of</hi> Adam. Mr. <hi>Dels</hi> Sermon, pag. 4. <hi>lin.</hi> 34.</p>
            <p>Now this is not the Reformation intended in the Text, For that reforma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now Mr. <hi>Dell</hi> expounding the Reformation in the Text to be the mortifying destroying sin, &amp;c. and likewise affirming (as he doth, <hi>p.</hi> 3. <hi>l.</hi> 26.) that this time of Reformation was not til Christs comming in the flesh, he must of necessity maintain that al the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full before and under the Law had no such Reformation as the mortifying &amp; destroying of sin;<note place="margin">

               </note> and so lays them under an impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of being saved, and so falls in with the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who hold that neither grace nor any thing of the Spirit, not eternall life was enjoyed by the Elect under the Law, untill Christs comming in the flesh. Mr. <hi>Dels</hi> mistake in expounding his Text, would make one think that he made his Sermon before he chose his Text; some no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about Reformation swimming in his brain, here meeting the with word (though not the thing intended) forc't it to serve his purpose; though indeed it is little to the purpose; yet is he not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to say, <hi>This the Spirit would have us take notice of in these word,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:36298:5"/>
Serm. p.</hi> 4. <hi>l.</hi> 12. Although indeed the Spirit of God intended some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing in this Text, <hi>viz.</hi> That Christ changed the Leviticall cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and sacrifices by offering himselfe a sacrifice once for all for the Redemption and justification of the Elect; Now the Priesthood being changed and Christ our High-Priest being come, the yearly sacrifices taken away, &amp; Christ sacrificed once for al; there being now a better Priest, a better Sacrifice, a better Tabernacle then was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, this was called a time of Reformation, so that the Text carryes a reference to a change in the Jewish services, not in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians hearts. Thus having briefly laid down his mistake in expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Text, I proceed now to view some passages in his Sermon.</p>
            <p>That he might gain attention and beliefe, he ushers in what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to say with this insinuating Preamble. <hi>I shall represent in some Gospel-light (to this Honourable Auditory) the true Reformation of the Church of the New Testament,</hi>

The reasons which evince the warrantablenesse of Magistrates practice, to enjoyne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall conformity in outward dutyes of outward worship and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and to confirme these by civill sanction, I shall lay down briefly. 1. Because the Magistrate is ordained by God, not onely to be a practicer of the law himselfe, but to be a protector thereof, and to punish the breach thereof in others, this not onely the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, but Master <hi>Burton</hi> the vindicator of the Independent Churches saith, <hi>a mans practises, if they bee against any of Gods commands of the first or second Table, it appertaines to the civill Magistrate to punish, who is for that cause called</hi> custos utriusque tabulae <hi>the keeper of both Tables</hi>: These bee his very words. Now if a Magistrate may protect the law, and punish the open breach of the law of the first Table as well as the second, what should hinder but hee may enjoyne exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall conformity to the law I know not. 2. Reason, else a Magistrate in a Common-wealth should behold men as an indifferent spectator, not caring what Religion they be of, whether Papish, Pagans, Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Socinians, &amp;c. unlesse he hath a power to enjoyn external confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, in outward worship. 3. Reason, else the holy Princes and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, as <hi>Asa, Iehosaphat, Hezekiah, Iosiah,</hi> with others who are recorded
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:36298:8"/>
to be zealous in enjoyning outward conformity (and that under a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty) in outward worship, should lye under blame for thus doing, as doing a worke not belonging to them; If Mr. <hi>Dels</hi> assertion were true, that secular power cannot enjoyne outward conformity in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes of outward worship. But observe good reader, how Mr. <hi>Dell</hi> doth endeavour to hinder the Magistrate to countenance and confirm by law (or civill sanction as he cals it) the worship and government of Christ, and externall conformity thereto, by this following passage.</p>

He joynes Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill and Ecclesiasticall-Reformation together, as if one and the same, whereas they are clearly distinct: as 1 There are distinct officers, secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar rulers in one; Pastors, and Teachers in the other. 2. There are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct censures; the one may abridge of liberty and life, the other on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excommunicate from a Church societie, but cannot inflict any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily censure. 3. Distinct in their ends; Church-Reformation onely ayming at the gaining of our brother to God, and preserving the Church from infection and offence: State-Reformation reaching onely to the outward practice, ayming at the outward peace; now though they be thus distinct, yet he jumbles them together, as if one and the same.</p>

in regard of continuall wars, to set about the work, therefore God indulged him; The Lord considering that during <hi>Davids</hi> seven yeares and a halfes Reigne over <hi>Judah,</hi> there was a continuall war between the house of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> then after hee was King of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> hee had wars with the <hi>Iebusites</hi> in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> afterwards fought twice with the <hi>Philistines,</hi> and still set upon by daily assaults; it was inconvenient for him to build the Temple, considering also that there was to bee above sevenscore thousand men to bee imployed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the building of the Temple,<note place="margin">King 5.15.6</note> which <hi>David</hi> could not conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently spare from the warre during his Reigne, this then was the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reason why God dispensed with <hi>David,</hi> that hee should not build the Temple; not as if it had been evill in him to undertake it, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient for him, because he had not leisure or time to undertake so long and great a work.</p>

            <p>Reader, take notice that Mr. <hi>Dell</hi> in handling the third generall, which was, by what meanes Christ brought about this Reformation; he gives an Orthodox answer, that 'tis brought about by the Word and Spirit, <hi>Serm. p.</hi> 14. but yet in the explicating and amplifying of these two meanes, hee hath very harsh and unsavoury passages against the morall Law, which makes mee suspect him to be tainted with the Antinomian errour. I'll gather up his own words scattered up and downe his booke, as in <hi>pag.</hi> 17. <hi>lin.</hi> 23. hee saith, <hi>The word by which the Church is Reformed is not the word of the Law, for the Law made nothing perfect, but the word of the Gospel, this, this is the onely-word that workes Reformation,</hi> by which it seemes to mee hee excludes the Law from being any way instrumentall for the converting and reforming of a sinner. Then observe further in <hi>pag.</hi> 18. <hi>lin.</hi> 5. hee saith to the same effect, <hi>That the word whereby Christ Reformes, is not the word without us, as the word of the Law is, but the word within us.</hi> Then in <hi>pag.</hi> 19. <hi>lin.</hi> 3. hee saith, <hi>That the word of the Gospel is the onely reforming word, and if there bee never so much preaching, if it bee but legall, it will Reforme no body aright</hi>: Now what he meanes by legall preaching, I cannot tell; for my part I account that onely to bee legall preathing, either to cry up the observation of the ceremoniall Law, or to preach justification by the workes of the morall Law; besides this, I know not what is legall preaching: Surely Mr. <hi>Dell</hi> hath not such cause to taxe the godly Ministers of this Kingdome to be legall Preachers, for who goes about to set up the ceremoniall Law for the observation thereof, or the morall Law to get justification thereby? I know none: but if Mr. <hi>Dell</hi> meanes, that to preach the duties of the morall Law, or the matter contained in the Law, (which to mee seemes to bee his sense) that this cannot bee instrumentall to reforme the heart; in this I am against him, and the Scriptures also gain-say him touching this matter; <hi>When the Levites read the Law, and expounded it, the people wept very sore, Nehem.</hi> 8.8, 9. A good evidence of the Reformation of some among them; besides the preaching of the Prophets was but an expatiating and explicating the duties commanded in the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and shall we imagine that none were reformed by that way of preaching? besides, to what end doth Christ himselfe expound and presse the Law, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. and the Apostles after him urge the duties of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:36298:13"/>
the Law, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.1, 2. <hi>Iames</hi> 2.8.10, 11. If preaching the duties of the morall Law, or the matter contained in it, could be no wayes instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall to reforme the hearts of men? I have herein beene too large.</p>
            <p>I shall onely mention one unsavoury passage more about the Law, then proceed to what else may be justly excepted against, 'Tis in <hi>page</hi> 19. <hi>lin.</hi> 14.</p>

               </note>All these words are left out in the printed Copy; and what should be the reason thereof? Oh that the omission of these words did arise from a suspicion of the invalidity and impertinency of his proofes for what he intends: if this did abate his confidence in the Presse from what it was in the Pulpit, I should in time hope that he would with <hi>Augustine</hi> write a booke of Retractations, and reclaime his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous opinions; I am not in despaire as touching this, for hee hath turned from Episcopacy to Independency, and now for
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:36298:13"/>
Anarchy; and who knows whether he may not turne for Presbytery in the end, which is my earnest desire to God for him, since I heard and read what opinions he holds.</p>
            <p>There is one thing more I might inquire into, What reason Mr. <hi>Dell</hi> had to use those words as a Prologue to what hee was to say, <hi>If it offend any we cannot helpe that the Word of God should be a stone of stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and rocke of offence.</hi> If hee intended onely that Magistrates can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reforme the heart, that is Christs worke alone; I doe not thinke there was one in the Congregation that would bee, or could bee offended at that; wherefore it made me thinke when hee used those words, that something either erroneous (as indeed it was) or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversall would fall from him, else there had beene no need of such a Preamble as that was.</p>
            <p>I will now addresse my selfe to view over those causes or reasons he gives, why he will by no meanes grant the Spirituall Church of Christ, to be reformed by worldly and Secular power, which if hee meanes in this sense that Secular powers cannot Reforme the heart, hee might well spare his paines in alleadging reasons; all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation was fully satisfied in that without further reasons; but certainly something else these causes hee laies downe were inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for, to plead for some such thing as this, that because the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate cannot reforme the heart, therefore hee must not put to his hand to represse the divulging of Hereticall opinions; nor punish those persons that doe: I cannot discerne at what marke hee should aime at but this. I now come to consider of the Causes or Reasons as he layes them downe.</p>
            <p>His first Reason:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Forcible Reformation is unbeseeming the Gospel,</hi>

               </note> If by forcible Reformation he meanes that a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Magistrate should not force by fire and sword, an heathen people to embrace the faith, I shall not contend with him; but if he meanes that Magistrates must not among people professing the faith, put forth their power to suppresse Heresies, and punish the divulgers thereof, this is not unbeseeming the Gospel, but most consonant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. For did not <hi>Paul</hi> in the want of a Christian Magistrate in

            </p>
            <p>I shall bee as briefe in my answer, as hee is in this Reason; If humane Institution should bee set up by the Civill Magistrate, (which is not intended by any) as a part of Gods worship this would bee unjustifiable; but if humane Institutions bee set up (<hi>circa sacra</hi>) onely as a prop to Gods worship, by their Civill sanction to give protection for the free and publique exercise of the worship of God.

            <p>If Ecclesiasticall Reformation brings men into blinde obedience, this is but an accidentall effect, the fault lies not in the Reformation, but in the ignorance of a mans owne minde, or perversnesse of will, that will not know or learne.</p>

            <p>If Church-Reformation (confirmed by the Secular Power) makes Hypocrites, this is but an accidentall effect as the former was, the fault is not in the Reformation, but in the unsoundnesse of mens hearts. This would reflect on the sincere powerfull preaching of the Word, as well as the Reformation; for by living under it, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are moulded into a forme of godlinesse, who yet are hypocrites; shall the word be therefore blamed? <hi>Iosiah</hi> in that glorious Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Iudah,</hi> caused all <hi>Iudah</hi> to stand to the Covenant, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>

                  <hi>Animadvers.</hi>
               </note> I shall suggest these foure particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That this effect is but accidentall, as the two former were: di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance and tumults doe not arise from any thing in Ecclesiasticall Reformation, but from the turbulency and violence of mens spirits, who plead for a lawlesse liberty, and are loath to be restrained by the golden reines of Discipline.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That disturbances and tumults following a Reformation, is no grounded Argument that that Reformation is evill, for then this would condemne Jesus Christ himselfe, for when hee came from the bosome of his Father to reforme his Church, 'tis said, That <hi>hee came not to send peace in the world, but a sword; for I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, &amp;c. Mat.</hi> 10.34, 35. Now because these offences and differences doe arise because of Christ; dare any lay the blame on him, as if hee were the cause thereof?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Where Presbyteriall Government is in use protected, and confirmed by the Civill Magistrate, there is most peace, union, and brotherly love, and least divisions and disturbances; should I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme this by quoting any Author of a Presbyterian judgement, some would not therefore beleeve it; wherefore that holy man of God, Mr. <hi>Burroughs,</hi> though hee bee dead, yet hee speaketh, in a Speech of his at Guildhall, on Friday, <hi>October</hi> 6. 1643. hee hath these words, That <hi>Scotland is certainly a Nation that God doth love, a Nation that God doth honour, it is a Nation that is united the most firmely under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; wee may truly call it a Phiadelthia, had wee the like union among us, O what great things had wee done before this time:</hi> So it should seeme in Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> opinion Presbyterian Government was no cause of Disturbance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and Tumults, but a bond to union: yea, Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> was not alone of this minde, but the other fou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To which you reply: I <hi>taught indeed that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ is a spiritual Kingdom, and the Reformation of it is answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but little thought that any man would have been so blind or worse, as to have affirmed the preaching of this spiritual and glorious Reformation, was to preach against all Reformation. Is the Reformation of Jesus Christ, which hee works by his Word and Spirit in all the faithfull, no Reformation at all? How durst you affirm this Mr.</hi> Love?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Mr <hi>Dell</hi> to clear himselfe from what I charged him with (<hi>viz.</hi> That he c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet Mr. <hi>Dell,</hi> to make men beleeve as if he were not against Ecclesiasticall Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, saith, <hi>That he thinks him mad or worse, that affirms spirituall Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion excludes all other Reformation</hi>: truly I am of his mind. Now that I might turn the edge of this Assertion against Mr <hi>Dell</hi> I shall reduce it into this Syllogism.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Major.</hi> That man that affirms spirituall Reformation, excludes al other Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is either blind or worse.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The Major Proposition is evident, Master <hi>Del</hi> himself confesseth it in the <hi>page</hi> fore quoted, <hi>p.</hi> 34.</p>
            <p>The Minor is as evident, <hi>viz.</hi> that Mr <hi>Dell</hi> affirms spirituall Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and excludes all other Reformation; for he saith expresly, <hi>That besides this spirituall Reformation he knows no other,</hi> Serm. <hi>page</hi> 5. <hi>line</hi> 2. and that this spirituall Reformation is the onely Reformation of the New Testament, <hi>Serm. page</hi> 12. <hi>l.</hi> 22. what then follows, but <hi>that M.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:36298:21"/>
your Reply, <hi>That I should affirm the Reformation of Iesus Christ by his Word and Spirit in the faithful is no Reformation</hi>: Truly Sir, I never durst hold so, its farre from my heart, I acknowledg heart-reformation to be the most glorious Reformation, yet not the only Reformation. I had thought you would have answered what I spake, and not unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fasten upon me what I spake not, but I perceive your tongue is your owne.</p>
            <p>Love. <hi>As if all were encompassed within the narrow heart of man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reply, <hi>Yet I said plainly enough when the heart is Reformed, all is Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and Gospel Reformation though it begins in the inward man, ends in the outward, did you Sir, accuse me rightly then or no</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 'Tis true, you said so in <hi>pag.</hi> 6. <hi>l.</hi> 22. and you said the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in <hi>pag.</hi> 5. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>Besides heart Reformation I know no other</hi>; and <hi>pag.</hi> 12. <hi>l.</hi> 22. <hi>Besides heart Reformation, the new Testament knows no other.</hi> Now if what you say in one place, you contradict in another, who can help it? And whereas you demand whether I accused you rightly, in laying to your charge that you held onely for heart Reformation denying all other. I answer, I did, and I stand to the accusation stil, for did not you say, <hi>Besides heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Reformation, there is no other Reformation that you know of; and that this is the onely Reformation of the new Testament</hi>; Let the Reader judge whether I did not then accuse you rightly.</p>

And again, if the thing be truly considered, it will appeare that you are more against the Covenant then I, for the Covenant engageth us to reform according to the Word of God, but you it seems would reform without, yea, against the Word, with outward and secular power, which you wil not suffer in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Answ.</hi> I have laid down all your words in this Reply, that others may discern, and you might bee convinced of the impertinency and falshood thereof; and that in five particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In this Reply, you take not off what I urged, <hi>viz.</hi> If there be one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heart Reformation, then must you rase out the first Article of the Covenant, which binds to a Reformation in Worship, Discipline, and Government, which is a Reformation distinct from heart Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but against this you speake not a word in this Reply, then I'le conclude that your silence gives consent.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:36298:22"/>2. You say you like the Covenant wel enough according to the true intention of it: truly Sir, you must pardon me, I cannot beleeve you; and that upon these grounds.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Covenant, according to the true intention of it, tyes to the Preservation of the Reformed Religion in the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline, and Government; but you like not that: you had rather pull down then preserve the Discipline of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> it being Presbyteriall; yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you call that the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Church that cals for the aide of the civil Magistrate for his civil sanction, which <hi>Scotland</hi> doth; and will you make mee beleeve you would preserve that Church or Government?</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Covenant, according to the true intention of it tyes us to indeavour to bring the Churches of God in the three Kingdoms, to uniformity in Religion, Confession of Faith, Forme of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Directory for Worship; but you like not these; you have in Print and Pulpit declared your dislike against most, or all of these: How then dare you say you like the Covenant wel enough according to the true intention of it?</p>
            <p n="3">3. You do untruly say, that I am more against the Covenant then you. In this I hope I shall easily convince you by an induction of particular passages in the Covenant. 1. I acknowledge the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> a Reformed Church, so doe not you. 2. I would in my place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and calling endevour to preserve the Reformed Religion in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so will not you. 3.

               </gap>orth that Reformation of Church Government or Discipline, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the first Article, to be a distinct reformation from that men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the end of the Covenant, but so do not you; for you hold that besides heart Reformation there is no other. Yea, 4. I, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Covenant, endevour after uniformitie in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but you do not so, unlesse your mind bee changed from what it was when you printed a Book against uniformity. 5. I am for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith; but you had three passages in your Sermon against it. 6. I am for a Form of Church government; but you not so, your Sermon wil testifie against you. 7. I am for a Directory for VVor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Catechizing; you not so. 8. I acknowledge my selfe bound in my place and calling to indevour the extirpation of Schism &amp; He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, as wel as Popery or Prelacy; but you do not so. These things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, with what face can you say, that I am more against the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

then you? I hope the ingenuous Reader will be a judge of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous thoughts about this matter betwixt us both.</p>
            <p n="4">4. You accuse me, and many others through my weake sides, as if we would Reform without and against the VVord; though the Lord knows the purpose of our hearts, that wee desire to make the VVord the rule to square all our services by; but because you onely say it, but not prove it, 'tis not worth a words speaking more.</p>
            <p n="5">5. You most falsly accuse me, and others of the Presbyterian judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that we will not suffer Secular power in the Magistrates hands, but will needs have it in our own; we desire none of the Magistrates power in our hands, which I have sufficiently spoken to in my Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversions on your Sermon. I must needs say you shew not plain and Christian dealing, that when you cannot overthrow what Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians say or practice, by convincing arguments, you would endevour to doe it by slanderous reports; this is not fair.</p>
            <p>Mr. Love, <hi>If this doctrine be true, that Gospel Reformation is only spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, then I wonder how</hi> Paul <hi>was so out,</hi> who said, <hi>When I come I will set all things in order? surely this was a Church-order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reply, <hi>Page</hi> 35. <hi>But pray what outward or secular power had</hi> Paul <hi>(who suffered not onely much from the world, but most from the false Apostles) to set the Church in order? Did</hi> Paul <hi>thinke you use any worldly power to set the Church in order, or only the power of the Word and Spirit? But these men think if the Church he set in order by the Word and Spirit only (which were suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in</hi> Pauls <hi>time) it's likely to be out of Order for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Having spoken to this Reply before, I may spare my pains now; yet m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st I let you know that you do me wrong in three particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In laying down a part of my words which you thought might best serve your purpose, and leave out the other part of my words, on which the weight of my argument lay, in urging that text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.34. <hi>The rest Ile set in order when I come</hi>: I said this <hi>order</hi> must be about matters of Ecclesiasticall Discipline, and not ordering about heart Reformation, for <hi>Paul</hi> could not order any thing about this, who should have this Reformation, who should not; who should have grace, who not; who should have small measures of grace, who great: so <hi>Pauls</hi> words must have reference to externall order in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Ecclesiasticall, as <hi>Calvin, Piscator,</hi> and <hi>Paraeus</hi> expounds it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. You doe mee wrong in laying downe my words to some other thing then I intended, as if I urged that Text to prove the power of the Civill Magistrate in matters of Religion; which I did not (other
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:36298:23"/>
Scriptures testifie that sufficiently I need not wrest this) but onely to prove that the new Testament warrants another kind of Reformation besides heart-Reformation; consisting in Ecclesiastical Constitutions for externall order; which this Text affirms.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In affirming that I (with others) think, if the Church b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e set in order by the VVord and Spirit, it is like to be out of order for us. I acknowledg the Church is then best ordered for us, when ordered by the VVord; seeing that order allows not such confused disorders, as the want of Church Discipline would bring in.</p>
            <p>Love. <hi>To cry down all kind of government under heart-government, and all Reformation as carnall, because you have the civill Magistrates hand to it; is against that place in</hi> 1 Tim 2 2. <hi>pray for Kings and all in authority that we may lead a peaceable life in all godlinesse and honesty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reply. <hi>Well argued now indeed. Babes and Sucklings you shall come forth and answer this Master in</hi> Israel, <hi>the sense of this place is evidently this, that Christians should pray for Kings and Governours, that God would so incline their hearts, that whilst wee live in godlinesse under them, they would suffer us to live in peace, and not make us fare the worse in the world for our interest in the Kingdome of God, and what one drop can Mr.</hi> Love <hi>squeeze out of this Scripture to coole the tip of his tongue? for the meaning is not that the Magistrate should inforce godlinesse, but protect us in godlinesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> To this I have 4 Things to say, 1. 'Tis true, you have my sense in the words you laydown for mine, but not my words. I said indeed, <hi>To cry down all Government and Reformation as carnall, because it hath the Protection or civill sanction of the Magistrate, doth crosse that place,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. and so I say still; and in stead of your calling forth your Babes and sucklings to answer this; you your selfe dare not come forth and deny it. 2. You had need call for Babes and Sucklings to answer this; some body else had need doe it, for indeed you doe not doe it your self; nay, you grant as much as I affirme, which I shall declare presently. 3. I cannot but take notice what a charitable allusion you have in comparing me to <hi>Dives,</hi> that I should squeeze a drop to coole the tip of my tongue; excellent good language for you to have in your mouth, what a damned man in Hell spake (if it bee not a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) where the Law of <hi>Love</hi> did not beare sway. You that have bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed this one expression from <hi>Dives,</hi> have borrowed many other expressions from some one else, not farre from him. 4. You grant what I affirme from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. You say, <hi>the Magistrate should not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force godlinesse, but protect godlinesse</hi>; So say I too; if hee must protect
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:36298:23"/>
us, how can this bee but by giving his Civill Sanction to allow us the publike exercise of that Religion and Government Christ hath set up within his Dominion? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <list>
                  <item>1. Here you leave out my words, and vary from the sense that I intended them; indeed I said, that to justle out the Magistrates power, as if hee had nothing to doe with matters of Reformation, was to justle out them from having any thing to do with the first Article of the Covenant, no more then any common man in the Kingdom.</item>
                  <item>2. You ungroundedly say, as if I had made it, (with others) the chiefe part of our businesse for a long while together, to justle out the Magistrate: the Lord judge betweene you and us concerning this thing: Magistrates never flourisht more, nor were they an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <item>3. You say, that we slander you, that wee might not bee mistrusted our selves; I could wish it were a slander, not a truth; as for any mistrust that we would avoid, we fear none; the simplicity of our hearts which we have in Christ Jesus, bears us up against all mistrusts, though we be slanderously reported.</item>

            <p>Love. <hi>Ezra was of another mind,</hi> Ezra. 7.26. <hi>Whosoever will not do the Law of thy God and the Law of the King, let judgement be executed speedily upon him; whether it be unto death, or unto banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reply. <hi>Well Sir, will you stand to this place, and shall this end the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie? Pray marke then, this was part of the decree of</hi> Artaxerxes <hi>a King of the Nations touching the Iews, for the rebuilding of the material Temple, that

            <p>And whereas you vauntingly boast and triumph, as if you had got the day, daring me to stand to this, which I am not ashamed nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to do, maintaining still that this Scripture doth warrant, that the civill Magistrate hath power to punish with death, banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or otherwise (as the evill deserves) for transgrefling the Lawes of God,<note place="margin">

            <p>I now come to view over what you lay down in page 38. to be the force of the place, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 7.26.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>You say that the force of the place is that the Magistrate may make a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree for all that are minded of their own free will to build the spirituall Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Iesus Christ, and to gather up into a Communion of Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I have two things to urge, 1. Here you speake for the civill Sanction of the Magistrate in matters of Religion, that he make a decree; but elsewhere you speake against this, as in <hi>Serm.</hi> p. 5. lin. 28. where you expresse your self that the duties of outward worship and government should not be confirmed by civill Sanction; and in page 24. lin. 34. and ult. that Christ called not for outward aid of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate; why then doe you here call in for his aide to make a decree to give you liberty for your selves, when you deny such a thing to us? 2. The extent of this decree, which you say this place <hi>Ezra</hi> 7.26. doth in force, that who are minded of their free will to gather into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints, should doe it; what is this but to say, that this Text doth warrant this, that the Magistrate should give an universall Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to any who will call themselves Saints to assemble together, and publikely professe their way;<note place="margin">

            <p n="2">2. You say, this is the force of the place, <hi>that the Magistrate ought to permit this to be d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. This place doth rather plead for a Clergy-constitution (as you scoffingly call it) hen any wayes deny it; for this decree of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was granted upon the request of <hi>Ezra,</hi> who was a Priest (compare <hi>Ezr.</hi> 7.6. with <hi>Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I shall say more to your third.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the third place you say, <hi>that the force of this text is, that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate may deterre me and the rest of the Kingdome, that are of the like minde, from resisting and hindering you in gathering into Communion,</hi> page 38. <hi>and a little before you say he may do it upon pain of death and banishment.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. You grant that the Magistrate may deterre mee and others of the like minde, that we hinder not your gathering together in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints, and that upon pain of death and banishment: by this I see your spirit, that you would have the Magistrate deterre, and that by death and banishment, the Presbyterians who doe oppose your gathering into Communion. Oh what jugling Hypocrisie is this, one while to cry downe the Magistrates power, when Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians desire his aid against Sectaries and Heretiques; anon to cry it up, that he should deterre upon pain of death or banishment, those of a Presbyterian judgement?

            <p n="2">2. But suppose I should fight with you with your own weapons, and argue by your owne Principles; Presbyterians plead their way to be truth and your way to be wrong, and that they are bound to oppose it, (and their consciences rest satisfied therein:) now if they should oppose your way, the Magistrate (by your own Principles) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not touch them, because they follow their consciences; How then dare you say the Magistrate may deterre men by punishments, for opposing you, and yet he must not deterre Heretiques by corporall penalties for opposing the truth?</p>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> I might observe that you doe not onely leave out much of my words, but also pervert them; 'tis a fault so frequently commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by you, and reproved by me, that I am weary to tell you of it any more. I come to answer your Interrogatories in your Reply. You demand, <hi>doth not God say, it was well that David thought to build the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yet hee should not build it</hi>? I say so too, and never said the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; I acknowledge, God said, 'twas well <hi>that David thought to build him an house,</hi> but yet he should not doe it, I denyed not that, but this I deny, that ever God said to the Parliament, it was well in them to thinke to reforme, but yet they must not doe it. I have spoken to this at large in my Animadversions on your Sermon, wherefore I forbeare it now; and whereas you charge mee that the Scripture can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee quiet for mee, I answer; I meddle not with the Scripture, but onely with your corrupt application of it; in which there were six absurdities, as I have evidently demonstrated in my Animadversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on your Sermon.</p>
            <p>Love. <hi>You neede not feare losing a Party.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reply <hi>Yea, but how if God be in that party? What then Sir, Is it not better keeping a little poore despised party that hath God in it, then a great and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous party without God? Again, did you preach before the Parliament to make or cast off parties; doth this appertain to the Mystery of Christ and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?

Reader, those men are so over-busie in making and marring parties, that I much feare they will in the end throw the Kingdome into more misery and bloud, then their Predecessors haue done.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Against Ecclesiasticall Reformation, as if it were not worthy the name of Reformation, because it doth onely restrain outward pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; whereas 'tis rather a commendation to the Reformation desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that it can doe so much, then a discommendation of it that it can do no more.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">P. 40.</note>2. You inveigh against Reformation, that the excellency of it is to tye up mad-dogs, and Beares, and Tygers: To tell you the truth, I think those that tye up those un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. You inveigh against the Reformation likewise, as if iron yokes and fetters for the outward man were the proper subject of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation: whereas Presbyterians doe unanimously acknowledge the censures of the Church are onely spirituall, they reach not the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man neither in estate, liberty, or life; that belongs onely to the civil Magistrate: Mr. <hi>Dell,</hi> let me tell you 'tis not fit, that when you cannot confute a party, you should belie them; when you cannot over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw what the Presbyterians hold, to asperse them with what they hold not.</p>

            <p>There are many other unsavoury passages in the latter end of your <hi>Reply,</hi> which hath made your Book to stinke before the people, both in vain commendations of your self, censorious expressions of me, and scandalous aspersions on others. Is not the end of your <hi>Reply</hi> stuft with a high conceit of your own Sermon, and a false conceit of mine? Do not you boast that your Sermon savors wel to the faithful, and ill to the world, and mine the contrary? Are not you so highly conceited of your Sermon, that it might be preacht any where, where the gospel hath a free passage, and mine onely fit for <hi>Rome,</hi> or some place else, where the precious Word is under restraint? do not you glory in your own light, which you call sometimes new, other whiles Gospel light, and lay me under this condemnation, that I have but old light, and am but an old Creature still? Ile not spend time in my own vindication, I had rather write an hundred lines to vindicate the truth, then one line to vindicate my selfe. But you rest not here, you are lavish in your censures of others also. Do not you say Ecclesiasticall Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Do not you say that the Ministers of this Kingdome (if you mean any body else tell, us so) <hi>would exalt themselves in Christs stead in the Church, and set under their feet the Magistrates power in the World, and that this is so evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that there is some operation of Satan upon him that sees it not.</hi> I need not returne answer to these vaine-glorious and censorious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, the very mention thereof will be a sufficient Confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to worke in the hearts of the people, a detestation of what you preacht and printed. I may end this answer as you doe (almost) your Reply, concerning me, that there are many other weake, passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, inconsiderate, and erroneous passages in your Epistles, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and Reply, neither worth troubling the Reader with, nor my selfe.</p>

               <hi>A</hi> Post-script, Vindicating the Author from many unjust aspersions cast upon him.</head>
            <p>MAster <hi>Dell</hi> in his Epistle to the Honourable house of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, reports that I preacht against the Articles at <hi>Oxford</hi>; which I did not, for when I desired the Honourable Worthies of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to cast their eyes upon the Universitie to reform it I did Premise this, that in what I should say I would no wayes reflect on the Articles at <hi>Oxford</hi>? which being made (as I said) stands with the honour and justice of the Parliament to have them kept; was this to preach against the Articles?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Mr <hi>Dell</hi> in his Epistle also chargeth me that I called the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a mongrill Parliament, which I did not; Indeed I said because errours and heresies spread, and the promoters thereof are not punisht therefore others accuse them to be so, but I never did.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is reported that Mr <hi>Dell</hi> should shew me his notes before he preacht, and that I did approve the matter, yet spent time in study to gain-say what he delivered: the originall of this report I finde to be one Mr <hi>Ireton</hi> in <hi>Pater-Noster Row</hi>; who saith that his Brother Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missary <hi>Ireton</hi> did affirm this to be true, which indeed is utterly false; I never saw Mr <hi>Dels</hi> face untill the munday before the Fast, nor had I any more words with him then to put to his choyce what part of the day he would chuse to preach on; I never knew one word of his Sermon untill I heard him preach it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I am aspersed for gain-saying what was preacht, and that so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly and publickely; the truth is, had I consulted with flesh and blood, to consider the greatnesse of the Assembly, the scantling mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute I had for meditation and recollection of what he preacht; if I had considered also whom I should likely displease, what censures I should incur, I should have been silent; but overlooking this and well weighing that I could not be true unto my own Principles, nor my inward peace, nor to the truth it selfe, I was constrained in Spirit to shew my dislike in giving some innocent touches on severall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound passages in the Sermon; presuming if one man dare be so bold to publish Error, another may take boldnesse to Vindicate the truth.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I am censured for not Printing my Sermon, as if I were ashamed or recanted of what I said (which I professe I do not;) well I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lye under this censure then run into Mr <hi>Dells</hi> error, to Print a Sermon preached before the Parliament, without their Order.</p>
