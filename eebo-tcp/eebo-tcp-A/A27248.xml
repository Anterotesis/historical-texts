            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Know not to whom I could Address these Leaves more properly than to You; who have been so dismally concern'd in the dreadful Effects of the late Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagrations: Such deep Sufferers by the <hi>Hellish Practises</hi> herein more fully than ever yet discovered.</p>
            <p>You have suddenly and unexpectedly seen a glorious City laid waste, Your own Habitations turn'd into Rubbish, your Estates destroyed, your dear Incomes of your many years hard Labour and careful Industry, All in few moments swept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and consumed by devouring flames, together with some of Your dear Relations and faithful Servants; whilst Your selves and Families reduc'd from a plentiful, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Trade and Fortune over-night, to the extremest misery next Morning,
<pb facs="tcp:48134:3"/>
without an House to shelter You, Goods to Accommodate You, or setled Course of Trade to support You? Have been forc'd (many of You in Old Age) to Begin the World anew; and remain Exposed to all the Hardships and Inconveniences of want and poverty?</p>
            <p>The Authors and Promoters of All these Your deplorable Calamities have been no other than those Common <hi>Bontefeu</hi>'s of Christendom, The general Disturbers of the Peace and Happiness of <hi>Europe,</hi> and Pests of human Society, I mean those subtle, active and most cruel Engineers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Hierarchy, who having long been Big with the Project of a <hi>Fifth-Monarchy,</hi> intending to make all the World slavishly to truc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle to their <hi>Tripple Crown'd Idol</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> did meerly in order thereunto contrive Your Destruction: For as they wellknow, <hi>England</hi> to be the <hi>Bull-work</hi> of <hi>Liberty, Protestanism,</hi> and (indeed I may justly add) <hi>Christian Faith</hi> in General, throughout the world: The main <hi>Bank,</hi> that hinders the Sea of <hi>Rome</hi> from over-whelming all Christian Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with an Universal Inundation of <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Superstition:</hi> So they are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible, what a mighty Influence <hi>LONDON</hi> hath to obstruct their Designs upon <hi>England:</hi> In so much, That I have heard not a few of the Principal of them frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly protest, <hi>That until That City were Ruined or brought low, it was impossible, But All their Attempts on this Nation must prove Abortive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How rigorously, how unweariedly have they endeavoured this? I shall say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their Politick By-strooks, Their promoting by Influenc'd Counsels <hi>Wars at Sea</hi> to interrupt Your <hi>Commerce,</hi> Their Setting up a <hi>New Algier</hi> (and perhaps more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable and mischievous than the <hi>Old</hi> One) on the other side the Channel: Their Multiplying <hi>Buildings</hi> in the <hi>Suburbs</hi> and Out parts, thereby to drain away the <hi>Trade,</hi> and having stock't many of those Colonies with people of their own <hi>Gang,</hi> hope to be able in time to <hi>out number</hi> and overpower You. These and a thousand other little Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegems for <hi>Discouraging,</hi> &amp;c. I shall not insist upon, but only instance, as my present bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, <hi>Their horrid Design of Burning and Destroying Treacherously this CITY.</hi> This they counted a Master-piece of their Cunning, not doubting, when they had laid this Noble <hi>City</hi> in Ashes: But that they should soon after have buried Your <hi>Religion</hi> too in the same Ruines: But notwithstanding all their facinorous Performances and more Cursed Attempts God in his Infinite Mercy hath Restor'd the <hi>One,</hi> and hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to preserv'd the <hi>Other: Both</hi> as it were by <hi>Miracle.</hi> Let therefore the Remembrance of <hi>SIXTY SIX</hi> be engraven in Indelible Characters on the Hearts of the Posterity, To make them abhor <hi>Popery,</hi> and detest such vile <hi>Incendiaries:</hi> Let it remain a <hi>Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>Gratitude</hi> to God, <hi>Caution</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>shame</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> in after times, when even that stately and durable <hi>PILLAR</hi> (Erected for that Purpose) shall by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions of many Ages be decayed.</p>
            <p>Indeed could you be so shamefully Ingrateful as to forget it, These restless Furies will not suffer You: But still with fresh Alarms and Exploits Awaken Your Memories. 'Twas a shrewd <hi>Item</hi> they bestow'd on You: But a few Years since, when <hi>Grove</hi> and his <hi>Irish Ruffians</hi> consumed so great a Part of Your Neighbourhood in the Borough of <hi>Southwark</hi> (not to mention other smaller Attempts.) But above all, They have given You, and the whole Nation such a <hi>Catholick Memorandum</hi> in their detestable <hi>Plot,</hi> lately discovered just before it was ripe for Execution, as I trust shall never be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, wherein though All these three Kingdoms, nay the whole <hi>Protestant-Interest</hi> throughout the World was Essentially Concern'd, yet none should have drank more deep of that Cup of Misery, which they had prepared than You the <hi>Protestant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants</hi> of This (by them hated) <hi>CITY</hi> and Parts adjacent: For as soon as ever the
<pb facs="tcp:48134:3"/>
Fatal Blow had been given against the pretious Life of our dear and dread Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, they would immediately have proceeded to a Second Devastation, <hi>first</hi> upon the Dwellings, and next upon the Persons, and then what Horrors and Calamities, what a Sea of Blood and <hi>Chaos</hi> of Confusion, You All, long 'ere this should have been involved in? Whilst these Sons of Cruelty had been Acting over their <hi>Parisian</hi> Tragedy and <hi>Irish</hi> Butcheries amongst You, is no less easy to Imagine, than lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to have seen, and Intollerable to have felt.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant, how strenuously they make it their Business to deny not only their being any way privy to these Mischiefs of FIREING, but likewise all other their Traiterous Designs: And I scarce know which is greatest, Their <hi>Impudence</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting horrid Villanies, or in <hi>out-facing</hi> them, when they are done. The Despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Protestations of Innocence, lately made by some of them at the place of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution,</hi> hath (I am informed) mightily unsetled some Peoples Heads, and a few For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal contrived Speeches have been so prevalent as to make weak Women, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker Men begin to stagger. and ready to imagine they died for Crimes they might not be guilty of.</p>
            <p>But as for my own Part, I bless God, I am throughly satisfied in the TRUTH of every Tittle of the Evidence, I have given against them, and every of them, and have no checks or guilt on my Conscience on that Account, nor would in the least be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that bloody Perjury, that might tend to the Taking away any mans Life wrongfully, for more than all <hi>England</hi> is worth: But if I have Erred in any Case, it was on the contrary hand in <hi>Speaking the least</hi> of Things and Persons, so for the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of others, I desire them to consider, besides the Joint Testimonies of so many Witnesses, speaking to different Times, Persons, Places and Circumstances, yet all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly agreeing in the main, without the least Contradiction of Falshood, that ever could be found after so many strict Examinations before Persons of the greatest Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Quality, and so many cross and insnaring Questions started by the Prisoners, to which they freely Answered; I say besides all this, and several other Corrobora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Particulars I would have them consider, 1. How Customary it is with this sort of Men, in all Cases where they are over-taken by Justice; to go out of the World with solemn Asseverations of their Innocence; there being, I verily believe scarce a President to be given in our Age, of any Papist that suffered for any Crime what so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, who confest the same at his Death, especially if he received absolution before; For I do averr it to be their Doctrine, that when a Man hath committed any Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany, and hath been thereof absolv'd by a Priest, if he be afterwards call'd into Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on touching that Fact; he ought not to cast a Scandal on the Church, whereof he is a Member, by acknowledging himself to have been guilty; but may lawfully swear and protest in the presence of God, and the world, that he is as Innocent thereof as the Child unborn, and all this without any Equivocation, or mental Reservation since tis their Beleif, and so they teach and are taught, that they are then so really, and absolutely innocent, even as when they came into the World, the crime being wholly taken off from them by Absolution; much more may they do it in this Case where what they are charged with <hi>viz.</hi> a Resolution, to murther a Prince whom they count an Heretick, and so declared by the Pope, subvert his Government; and introduce the Roman Religion; as so far from being by them esteemed any Treason or Crime, that they look upon it to be their Duty and Meretorious.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis palpable, that all these fine Speeches were studiously prepared by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy, and Copies industriously spread abroad before they were spoken by the Prisoners, their Agents and Friends; and they are contrived but just like so many Scholars Exercises on the <hi>Theme,</hi> set by their Grand Master, Provincial <hi>Whitebread.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48134:4"/>
Not with the Freedom of Dying Men that spoke the Truth, and Dictates of their Consciences, but so elabourately flourisht over as might best work on the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Ignorant Hearers; and serve the Turn of their Party, for where there is so much Art, there is always some design. Had not <hi>Hill</hi> just such another made Speech in the very same Strain and Method, which he was to spake at his Death like a <hi>Parrot?</hi> Sure, they are very dim-sighted that cannot see through such Impostures.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Do these doubting Gentlemen, really believe there was any Plot at all? Were <hi>Mr. Colemans</hi> Letters forged by others, and put by Magick-Art into Six Boxes; and and yet his Hand so curiously counterfeited, that he himself could not chuse but own it, and his Servants swear it, &amp;c. Either you must believe all these and many other down right Absurdities, or else confess that by those very Letters it evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears, that there was on foot a damnable horrid Plot to subvert the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and introduce Popery; and can you think Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> alone undertook that <hi>Mighty Work?</hi> (as himself calls it) Or if he had Accomplices, who more proper? who more ready than the Traitors that lately suffered; for when did the <hi>Jesuites</hi> stand out, when there was any Game to play for on the Interest of the <hi>Pope</hi> and Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> Not to mention, that the Matter is almost acknowledged in <hi>Peter's</hi> Letter taken with <hi>Harcourt;</hi> wherein a Consult is appointed the 14th. of <hi>April</hi> 1678 and mention made of great <hi>Caution</hi> to be used by the Fathers in coming to it, lest the <hi>Design</hi> there to be transacted and managed <hi>should be discovered which in its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture required secresy:</hi> By this Letter (not found till the other day the Witnesses evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, first given so long since, that <hi>there was such a Consult, and at that time,</hi> is undeniably confirmed; and that there was some <hi>great Design to be</hi> consulted of there that required much <hi>Caution and Secresy,</hi> is likewise confest; how reasonable than is it to believe the Witnesses in this Case; thot then and there, the Death of the King was consulted of, and resolved upon: That being a Design that indeed requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in its own horrid Nature such Caution, and Secresy, and the Conspirators be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not able to assign any other Design, they had there of such a Nature; nor could they give any sensible Intrepretation of those <hi>Patents</hi> sent to <hi>Whitebread</hi> mentioned in another Letter, taken with <hi>Harcoat,</hi> by which was meant the Commisions for Forces to carry on this Hellish Rebellion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. What think you, was there ever such a Man as Sr. <hi>Edmundbury Godfry<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> was he not murthered? and who can fall within the Suspicion of any probable Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to have done it, but the Papists that is these Traytors and their Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? which now is more plain upon them than before; for if they had not been the Procurers of it, how was it possible, that the same Night that worthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was Murthererd? <hi>Harcoat</hi> should write word thereof into <hi>Stafford-shire;</hi> whereas his Death was not known in <hi>London</hi> by any, but those concerned in it, till Five Days after.</p>
            <p>But why should I trouble my self, to demonstrate that tis Light at Noon-day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Bats and Moles are and and will be Blind? His Most Gracious Majesty, is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, as appears by several of his Royal Proclamations; Both Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is fully satisfied, as is evident from their Votes expresly made on that occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; The Right Reverend Fathers in God, my Lords The Bishops, in particular no doubt are satisfied, as is plain by the Form of Prayers prescribed to be used on the last Fast. All the learned Judges of the Land generally present at the Late Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als; the Judicious Gentle-Men of the several Jurys, (both upon their Oaths, as well as the Evidence) and all intelligent Auditors (except Papists) are intirely satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and if there be yet any others that are not; I do not doubt, but in due time (for
<pb facs="tcp:48134:4"/>
as there yet are diverse things behind the Curtain) there will be such open plain Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beam discoveries made, as shall certainly convince them, unless like Papists, they shall at once refuse to believe, either their Reason or their Senses.</p>
            <p>As to the Discourse, which I here present you with; The First part is an Account of what I know, and was actually imployed in by the <hi>Benedictines</hi> and <hi>Jesuites</hi> for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving, promoting and carrying on of Fires in and about this City; the rest consists of Affidavits Informations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of others touching matters of the same nature, of which some tis true, have been formerly published, but many of them imperfectly, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers now almost out of Print, or not common to be had; and all before scatteringly set forth in several Books; These I thought fit to insert together here for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler satisfaction of the present Age, and Posterity; to which is added some Account of Latter Fires, and several Observables that occurred relating thereunto not before made publick; All which I conceive may be both welcom and useful in this Juncture:</p>
            <p>TWO Things I would particularly Advertise You to Take Notice of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The FIRST is the several ways, whereby these Mischievous People begin and promote Fires, which indeed are so various, that 'tis difficult to Enumerate them all: But we know they have practised these that follow,</hi> viz.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. By Fire-Balls put in with Poles or otherwise through Holes, or open places into Houses; as at Mr. <hi>Farriners</hi> House which began the Great Fire.</item>
               <item>2. By hard Fire-balls thrown through Glass-windows, as at the Smiths in Black-Friars.</item>
               <item>3. By flinging the said Balls, or other Combustible Matter fired into Cellars through the Bars, or Grates, where they are left without Shutters, as at the Oyl-Mans in <hi>Southwork.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. By firing their own Lodgings, as the French-man did in Shoe-Lane, in the time of the Great Fire; and likewise, the two <hi>Peters</hi> near Safron-Hill.</item>
               <item>5. By hiring Cellars in dangerous places, filling them with Combustibles, and then firing them, which was a Course they much advised me to.</item>
               <item>6. By Firing Haylofts, as in <hi>Smithfield.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>7. By Strangers faining Errands, as in the Temple.</item>
               <item>8. By untiling Houses, Breaking Windows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and there putting in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustibles.</item>
               <item>9. By getting into Empty Houses and Setting them on Fire, as in <hi>Budge-Row.</hi> 1670.</item>
               <item>10. By Creeping into back-yards and firing stacks of <hi>Bavins, Reed,</hi> &amp;c. as at <hi>Lime-House.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <pb facs="tcp:48134:5"/>
11. By going into <hi>Victualling-Houses,</hi> and leaving behind them Trains for Firing, as at the <hi>Cooks</hi> in <hi>Fetter-Lane</hi> and in <hi>Southwark.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>12. By Consederate Servants, as lately at the Attorneys in the same Lane.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>And That such FIRES may be the more Destructive, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, their Instructions are,</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. To do it in select Places amongst Old Buildings, and where Engines can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not play.</item>
               <item>2. To FIRE the <hi>Water-Houses,</hi> and get the <hi>New River-Water</hi> stopt, if they can, for that time near that Place.</item>
               <item>3. To have Some of their Chief Friends thereabouts, that may misadvise Great Persons, That they may blow up Houses, where it is not necessary, or where rather it will do harm by Opening a Passage for the FIRE.</item>
               <item>4. To have some of their Active Instruments, who under pretence of helping may scatter FIRE BALLS in contiguous Houses, and break down the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, Roof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to let in the FIRE more easily.</item>
               <item>5. To have others attending, that shall cry out against <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Papists;</hi> and mightily pitty the People, thereby getting to be trusted with Removing of Goods, and so to plunder and steal; or if they find an oportunity to fire HOUSES at a Distance.</item>
               <item>6. Curiously to observe <hi>WIND</hi> and <hi>TIDE</hi> in all Attempts, as likewise Frosts, and very dry Times, and chuse <hi>Sundays</hi> for doing the business, because then there is the least Water.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The other Thing I would advise You of, is not to Conceit, because the <hi>PLOT</hi> is discovered in some measure, and some few of Them brought to Justice, That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now You are secure, and that They will desist from such Attempts: For I know their Nature and Principles so well, That I dare assure You on the contrary, They will be more Active and Virulent now than ever: And for some proof of this be pleased to consider, How many FIRES have either actually hapn'd, or been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd, or begun, though by Providence, prevented, since the Discovery of the PLOT.</p>
            <p>As,</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <pb facs="tcp:48134:5"/>
At <hi>Limehouse,</hi> Septemb. 18.</item>

               <item>At New-Prison.</item>
            </list>
            <p>All these and probably many others, that I never heard of, have been since the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining of September last; so that you see, they are still going on with the Trade of <hi>Twexbury-Mustard-Balls,</hi> when ever they have an opportunity; it will therefore concern all Protestants, to be careful and cautious to prevent such mischeifs from these wicked Incendiaries, who still swarm about this Town, thinking themselves more safe here, than in the Country, and better able to hold correspondence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know well, with what Envy and Malice they behold the City; and that they will leave no Villany unatempted, to lay it once more Level with the Ground, unless possibly seeing it so gloriously Rebuilt, and upon consideration of late Circumstances, they should think it now better Hubandry to preserve it for their own use, as <hi>Harcoat</hi> the Tower, than to destroy it, and so invert the other of their Design, and strive first to Depopulate and Massacre its troublesom Inhabitants; that so themselves and their French Friends may take Possession of these Noble Structures; and quietly enjoy the Accomodation of the Hereticks Pains and Charge, as the <hi>Jewes</hi> those of the <hi>Cananites:</hi> this I am certain of, thas you are continually to expect from them the
<pb facs="tcp:48134:6"/>
               <hi>worst,</hi> that a most improved <hi>Subtilty</hi> joyned with the most Implacable <hi>Malice,</hi> Both egg'd on with vast Bats of <hi>Profit</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> and sharpned with the Fury of blind <hi>Zeal</hi> and Thirst of <hi>Revenge,</hi> can either contrive or execute.</p>
            <p>To prevent which nothing can be more effectual than <hi>Union,</hi> and a good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing amongst all Protestants, though of different Perswasions.</p>
            <p>To obviate the ill Art of this common Enemy, whose Instruments by a Thousand Devices dayly seek to exasperate you one against another: you must study to <hi>cement,</hi> as much as they to <hi>divide;</hi> But above all, let no Jesuitical Impressions howsoever maskt; be able in the least to Impair the Loyalty to the King, or wheadle you into any tumultuous disturbances; you can no way gratifie, or serve their Interest, more than by such a wicked Folly; this is the Point they would gain upon you; (and which they have pusht on so unhappily elsewhere) and then infallibly you shall bear the whole <hi>Odium</hi> of their Hellish-Plot.</p>
            <p>May the God of Heaven ever preserve His Majesty from the open violences, and secret Assassinations of these Bloody-minded Men, as likewise from their subtle Insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations; may the same Omnipotent Power Bless and Protect these Nations in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and the City of London in particular, that his Majesty may have a long and Prosperous Reign; the Protestant Religion flowrish, and the Designs of <hi>Rome</hi> be blasted, discovered and confounded; Is, and shall ever be the Hearty Prayers and Endeavours of him,</p>

            <head>A NARRATIVE OF THE Popes late Fire-Works IN ENGLAND.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S there is not a more <hi>malicious</hi> sort of <hi>Vermine</hi> in the World than the <hi>Iesuits</hi> and other <hi>Factors</hi> for <hi>Rome</hi> (for let me tell you the <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictines</hi> and rest of the Orders; nay, the dullest <hi>Mass-jobbing Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,</hi> are not at all behind hand with the former, in <hi>will</hi> to commit Roguery, whatever they are in <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>sufficiencies</hi> to conduct and manage it) so there can be none more <hi>cursedly ingenious</hi> in inventing and promoting the most exquisite, various, and to us still <hi>new</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of doing mischief. <hi>Treason</hi> and <hi>Rebellion,</hi> private <hi>Murthers,</hi> and publique <hi>Massacres,</hi> poison'd <hi>Daggers,</hi> and consecrated <hi>Knives:</hi> All these have long since been their daily <hi>past-time,</hi> the <hi>old Instruments</hi> of their worse than Pagan Cruelties: But of late years they have thereto added and set on foot in these parts another <hi>medium</hi> of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, to ruine Protestants in a more oblique and clandestine way; since they had not (as is hop'd they never shall have) power to re-kindle the <hi>Marian Bonfires,</hi> and <hi>consume</hi> their Bodies: they resolv'd, and make it their business treacherously to <hi>Fire their Houses,</hi> to destroy their <hi>Goods</hi> and <hi>Estates,</hi> till they might be strong enough to venture on their <hi>Persons.</hi> This Hell-hatcht Design was hugg'd by these holy Fathers as a most Ghostly Expedient for their purpose, for hereby they could undo Hundreds, sometimes Thousands of <hi>Families</hi> in a few hours space; and the poor <hi>Souls</hi> scarce ever imagine who hurts them. Hereby they could lay waste our <hi>Metropolis,</hi> and designed the same against other Goodly Cities, Corporations, and Chief Places of Trade (against which they have a particular Spleen) and then to ascribe the disaster to Providence, as a Judgment for their <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,</hi> or at least to make the Ignorant believe it was only the pure Effect of <hi>Chance,</hi> or Default of a drowsie <hi>Negligence;</hi> whilst in the mean time they with Triumph warm their own Fingers at the <hi>Flames:</hi> and not only weaken and <hi>impoverish</hi> Protestants, but in those <hi>Distractions</hi> necessarily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending such <hi>Calamities,</hi> make great Advantages to themselves, by <hi>Filtching, Stealing, Plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> &amp;c. Besides the opportunities they ever hoped then to gain, of putting in execution their long designed <hi>General Massacre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I speak not this by <hi>Guess</hi> or <hi>Hear-say,</hi> but out of <hi>certain Knowledge:</hi> And therefore as I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to discharge my <hi>Duty</hi> to my <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Countrey,</hi> in discovering other Intrigues and Machinations of this Cursed <hi>Popish Plot,</hi> so I think my self obliged to set forth some <hi>Transactions</hi> that I have been privy unto, particularly concerning this matter: And therefore omitting se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Consults</hi> which have been held, and did all more or less relate to the grand <hi>Design, viz.</hi> The <hi>Destruction of His Majesty</hi> (whom God preserve) <hi>His Religion and Government,</hi> I shall at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent only undertake to give an Account of what I know hath been <hi>Ordered</hi> in these <hi>Consults</hi> (and in pursuance thereof <hi>prosecuted</hi> and <hi>attempted)</hi> tending to the <hi>Firing</hi> of <hi>London, Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In the moneth of <hi>Iune</hi> 1676. it was my Fortune to be at <hi>Paris,</hi> at the English Covent of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictine Monks,</hi> with whom (by several <hi>means</hi> and on diverse <hi>accounts,</hi> too tedious and not at all material here to be related) I had much <hi>ingratiated</hi> my self; so that at that time they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed an <hi>Intire</hi> Confidence in me as a fit <hi>Instrument</hi> for their Purposes. Amongst other Discourses that happened there about the great Business, which they and others were then most vigoriously
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48134:7"/>
carrying on; <hi>viz. To subvert the Protestant Religion and introduce Popery into England:</hi> They fell to debate the several <hi>wars</hi> and <hi>means</hi> preparatory thereunto, and what might be the best <hi>Expedients</hi> to facilitate and accomplish the same: And as they did nothing without <hi>correspondence</hi> and <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of counsels</hi> from their <hi>Fellow-conspirators</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> so some or one of them produced seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral betters from <hi>London,</hi> wherein were divers <hi>particulars</hi> relating to the <hi>Firing of the City and Suburbs</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and other <hi>Cities and eminent Towns</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> which was then and at all times concluded and agreed unto by them, to be the <hi>chief way</hi> and almost <hi>only means</hi> in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whereby to plain the <hi>way</hi> for their <hi>Design:</hi> For they were unanimously of Opinion, That it was absolutely <hi>necessary</hi> to <hi>weaken</hi> and <hi>ruin</hi> the said <hi>City</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> ere they could bring any of their other <hi>contrivances</hi> to perfection. In this Debate some of them thanked God (such was their <hi>impious piety)</hi> that their attempts upon <hi>London</hi> in that kind had hitherto <hi>succeeded</hi> very well; and though the Houses beyond all <hi>expectation</hi> were <hi>rebuilt</hi> to a greater degree of <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament</hi> than ever, yet many Thousands of her Inhabitants still laboured under the Effects, and languisht with <hi>Incurable Consumptions,</hi> occasioned by the late <hi>Burning Fevers</hi> they had cast her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: Adding, that they would <hi>never leave</hi> that <hi>City,</hi> till they had pulled down her <hi>Pride</hi> by <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Piracy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this <hi>Discourse</hi> and much more to the like purpose, which was very <hi>freely</hi> and <hi>earnestly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged,</hi> I being all the while present, they at last proceeded to ask me, <hi>Whether I would be assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to them in carrying on that Business, as I had been in the other</hi> great Concern; This <hi>being one of the best</hi> Expedients <hi>to</hi> ripen <hi>and</hi> push <hi>on</hi> That? To which I readily seem'd to assent; assuring them that I could and would do <hi>more</hi> therein than any other could: magnifying what intimate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge I had of all parts of <hi>London</hi> and some other great <hi>Trading Cities,</hi> which did capacitate me to effect such a <hi>Business</hi> more <hi>certainly</hi> and <hi>securely</hi> than another. In fine, they were extreamly satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and told me, <hi>That when I came to</hi> England, <hi>I should be joyned as an Assistant to Father</hi> Gifford <hi>for prosecuting the said Affair.</hi> This <hi>Gifford</hi> was a Jesuite, and (as the said Letters did specifie) the Person that had managed the great <hi>Conflagration</hi> in 1666, and as they said, was concerned in the <hi>Fire</hi> at <hi>Southwark</hi> (which had happened not above a month before this Discourse) and had attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted the like at many other times and places where he had miss'd of performance. This likewise is the same <hi>Gifford</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Depositions</hi> of Mr. <hi>Stubbs</hi> and <hi>Mary Oxley,</hi> herein after set forth; whereby the <hi>later</hi> was brought to set Fire to her Masters House in <hi>Fetter-lane</hi> in <hi>April</hi> last.</p>
            <p>At this Consult of the <hi>Benedictines</hi> there were several Letters produced as aforesaid, all rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the <hi>Firing of London</hi> and its <hi>Suburbs,</hi> and other <hi>Towns</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> and very urgent they were with me to be sure at my return to be very diligent and expeditious in dispatching the same: and that I should receive necessary <hi>Orders, Encouragement,</hi> and <hi>Supplies</hi> to inable me thereunto. But I being then upon a <hi>Iourney</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> heard no more of that Business till the year 1678; and then I was in a Consult with the said <hi>Gifford</hi> and several others, <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Iesuits</hi> (who met in such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults every Week, in order to carry on the Business of Firing) At this our Meeting it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to fire <hi>Lime-house</hi> and <hi>Wapping</hi> first, and then and by that means to burn all or the most of the Ships and Vessels in the River: For which purpose several of the said Consultors and their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistants, were to be ready on the Water, as men to help, but indeed to fire the outwardest Ships, and cut theirs, or other Ships Cables (as should be most convenient) to make them fall foul on each other, and burn together. In pursuance of this Resolution, a real Effect thereof was the Fire at <hi>Lime-house,</hi> that shortly after followed; though not doing that great Execution that they expected, by reason of the absence of some of the persons that were to have managed the same.</p>
            <p>After, which Fire I was with <hi>Gifford</hi> and others several Nights on the <hi>Thames</hi> about <hi>London Bridge,</hi> and there did make strict Observations of the Houses on either side; making choice of the <hi>widest</hi> and the <hi>lowest Windows</hi> in their <hi>Vaults</hi> and <hi>Cellars,</hi> or <hi>Lower Rooms;</hi> and taking notice what Houses had the most, and the most dangerous <hi>Combustible Materials</hi> in them, and where they might best and most effectually put in their surest <hi>Fire-balls</hi> and <hi>Instruments</hi> in the Night under the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, to burn down the <hi>Bridge;</hi> which they concluded to do at <hi>High-water,</hi> when their Boats might be brought almost equal to such Windows: We considered likewise of means how to fire the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London:</hi> But Father <hi>Harcourt</hi> (now lately executed for <hi>Treason)</hi> then told us, <hi>They had made sure of that place within;</hi> and therefore ordered us not to concern our selves with that: For it would be <hi>more</hi> for our <hi>advantage,</hi> to preserve it for our <hi>Business,</hi> than to destroy it.</p>
            <p>In short, for near a Twelve-month before I came in to make a <hi>Discovery,</hi> I had been imployed to use all Arts and Endeavors to carry on this Design of <hi>Firing the City</hi> of <hi>London</hi> and other places a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it; and the <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Conduct</hi> of it, how and where to set my Fires, was left chiefly to my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement; but with this limitation, that the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> who were the <hi>Master-Incendiaries,</hi> and my Imployers, were to see and inspect, how far and how sure I had laid my Combustibles and Fewel; which accordingly they did.</p>
            <p>In <hi>August</hi> last I did endeavour to rent several old <hi>Cellars,</hi> wherein to stow Wood, Coal, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Preparations, of which I was ordered to buy several Parcels; which accordingly I bought; as likewise several Barrels of Gun-powder and I did place them in many parts of the City and Suburbs, in order to this Damnable Design: And that the Reader may not think this a naked Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, but that the truth and certainty of what I here aver, may the better appear, I will here
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48134:7"/>
set down particularly some of the places that I so took, to hold this <hi>Wood</hi> and <hi>Coal,</hi> and where I did House many Chaldrons of <hi>Coals</hi> and Hundreds of <hi>Faggots, &amp;c.</hi> to this purpose: <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some Hundreds of <hi>Faggots</hi> and Provision of <hi>Coal, &amp;c.</hi> for this very use, I laid in at my Lodging in <hi>Essex Garden,</hi> at the Back-door of the <hi>Palsgraves-Head</hi> Tavern, near the <hi>Temple;</hi> which was to burn the <hi>Temple,</hi> with the Records and Writings there.</p>
            <p>Another parcel was in <hi>Brewers-yard</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> at a Cellar and some old Buildings there; which Cellar doth belong to Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> at the <hi>Red Bible</hi> in <hi>Bedford-street.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another parcel at Mr. <hi>Browns</hi> in <hi>White Friars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some I was to send into an <hi>Old Cellar</hi> at Mr. <hi>Withers</hi>'s at the <hi>Plough</hi> in <hi>Seething Lane:</hi> More into <hi>Red</hi> and <hi>White-Cross-street, Bishops gave-street, Queen H<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Several other Designs have been laid, in order to this Work, to set divers places on fire; and not a few Persons imployed, but none of them knowing each other; some of which have taken effect in part, some have not: But without speedy prevention and great care, they will alwayes (as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied in villany) <hi>attempt,</hi> and too often (as we have just cause to fear) <hi>perform</hi> what they have laid and contrived by so many and different ways and means; all still held in read ness, and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only the dismal <hi>Blow</hi> directed against our Sovereigns <hi>Life;</hi> which God defend. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The last <hi>Consult</hi> I had with them about the <hi>Affair</hi> of <hi>Firing,</hi> was in <hi>August</hi> 1678. when I laid in my <hi>stores</hi> for the Work; others were then consulting and advising how to <hi>put the King out of the way</hi> (for by that phrase they generally express <hi>Murther)</hi> and such of the Magistrates as did most oppose them: And that being done, my <hi>Firing</hi> of <hi>London</hi> was to follow; and upon that Confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration, as a general <hi>Signal,</hi> we were openly to appear in <hi>Arms</hi> and declare for the <hi>Pope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for a more full <hi>satisfaction</hi> to all the <hi>World,</hi> and the further Confirmation and Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of what I have said, and to demonstrate that the great <hi>Fire</hi> in 66. and divers others since, were begun and carried on by the <hi>Contrivance</hi> and <hi>Industry</hi> of the <hi>Papists,</hi> especially <hi>Iesuites</hi> and Priests, and their <hi>Instruments;</hi> I shall to this Testimony of mine own add the true Copies of divers <hi>Plain</hi> and <hi>Authentick Affidavits, Depositions, Examinations,</hi> and <hi>Informations</hi> of many others, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in unto <hi>Committees</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and taken before <hi>Iustices</hi> of the <hi>Peace,</hi> or other sufficient Authority, relating to the same <hi>Matter:</hi> And likewise annex an <hi>Account</hi> of the several notable <hi>Fires</hi> since 66. to this time, with some Observations on the Circumstances thereof, and remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Passages therein: All which sufficiently corroborate and make it evident, to whose <hi>Designs</hi> and <hi>Management</hi> it is, that <hi>England</hi> ows most of the late Dismal <hi>Calamities</hi> by <hi>Fire,</hi> which have been so much more frequent and destructive of late years (notwithstanding the great Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Art</hi> to <hi>prevent</hi> and <hi>quench</hi> them) than ever heretofore.</p>
            <p>And first of all I shall recite those Testimonies relating to the <hi>Dreadful Fire</hi> in 66. the vast da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage whereof may be conceived to be <hi>inestimable,</hi> by this brief state of the Extent of the Ground laid <hi>desolate,</hi> and the number of <hi>Houses</hi> then consumed, extracted from the <hi>Certificates</hi> of the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyors</hi> soon after appointed to survey the <hi>Ruins:</hi> whereby it appeareth,</p>

Mr. <hi>Kitley</hi> of <hi>Barkin</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> informs, That one Mrs. <hi>Yazly,</hi> a Papist, of <hi>Ilford</hi> in the said County, came unto his House, <hi>August</hi> the 13th, and being in discourse with his Mother, said, <hi>They say the next</hi> Thursday <hi>will be the bottest day that ever was in</hi> England. She replied, I hope the hottest season of the year is now past. To which she answered, <hi>I know not whether it be the hottest for Weather or for Action,</hi> This Mrs. <hi>Yazly</hi> coming to the same House the Week after the Fire, Mr. <hi>Kitley</hi> said to her with some trouble, I have often thought of your <hi>Hot Thursday:</hi> To which she replyed, <hi>It was not indeed upon the</hi> Thursday, <hi>but it happened upon the</hi> Sunday <hi>was sennight after.</hi> Mrs <hi>Yazly</hi> hearing this Evidence produced against her, endeavoured to avoid the words, saying, That upon the 13th of <hi>August</hi> she did tell Mrs. <hi>Kitley, That they say the next Thursday will be the darkest Thursday that ever was in</hi> England, but not otherwise; which she affirms to have received from one <hi>Finchman,</hi> an old Woman of <hi>Ilford;</hi> who being examined by a Justice of Peace to discover the truth thereof, denied that ever she said any such words to Mrs <hi>Yazly,</hi> or that she had discoursed with her about any such matter. And as to the subsequent words, she saith Mrs <hi>Yazly</hi> denies ever to have spoken them: But Mr. <hi>Kitley</hi> offered in her presence (if it should be demanded) to bring his Mother and Wife to testifie the same.</p>

And in some short time after, he should see as bloody a time as ever was, since</hi> England <hi>was</hi> England. This discourse was not much ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of at that time it was spoken. But when the City of <hi>London</hi> was Burnt, the said <hi>Henry Baker</hi> gave this Information to the said Mr. <hi>Ducket,</hi> and thereupon he issued out his Warrant to apprehend <hi>Woodman,</hi> but he was gone out of the Country, and cannot be heard of since.</p>

When <hi>Piede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou</hi> taking him out of the Ship, carried him into <hi>Pudding-Lane,</hi> and he being earnest to know whither he would carry him? he would not satisfie him till he had brought him to the place, and then he told him, that he had brought three Balls, and gave him one of them to throw into the house. And he would have been further satisfied in the design, as he said, before he would execute it: But <hi>Piedelou</hi> was so impatient that he would not hear him, and then he did the <hi>Fact,</hi> which was, That he put a Fire-Ball at the end of a long Pole, and lighting it with a piece of March, he put it in at a Window <note n="*" place="margin">The Alehouse in <hi>Buttolphs</hi> Lane joyning to Mr. <hi>Farri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

He confessed that there were <hi>Three and twenty Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices,</hi> whereof <hi>Piedelou</hi> was the <hi>Chief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Graves</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Merchant living in St. <hi>Mary Axe,</hi> Informed this Committee, that he had known <hi>Hubert</hi> ever since he was four years old, and hath ever observed him to be a person of a mischievous inclination, and therefore fit for any villainous enterprize; And because of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he had of him, he went to visit him in Poison, where when he saw him, he could not but commisorate the condition whereinto he had brought himself. And for his better discovery of the <hi>Fact,</hi> he told him the said <hi>Hubert,</hi> that he did not believe he had done that of which he confessed himself guilty. To which <hi>Hubert</hi> replyed, <hi>Yes Sir, I am guilty of it, and have been brought to it by the instigation of Monsieur</hi> Piedelou; <hi>but not out of any malice to the English Nation, but from a desire of Reward which he promised me upon my Return into</hi> France.</p>
               <p>It is observable, that this miserable creature who confessed himself to the Committee to be a <hi>Protestant,</hi> was a <hi>Papist,</hi> and died so. And as for the aforesaid <hi>Piedelou,</hi> the said Mr. <hi>Graves</hi> informed, that he had a full knowledge of him, and knew him to be a very Deboist Person, and apt to any Wicked Design. Moreover, for a clear conviction of the Guilt of the aforesaid <hi>Hubert,</hi> Mr. <hi>Lowman,</hi> the Keeper of the <hi>White-Lion</hi> Prison, was appointed to set him upon a horse, and to go with him, and see if he could find out the place where he threw the <hi>Fire-Ball.

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Lowmans <hi>Certificate concerning the Behaviour of the said</hi> Robert Hubert, <hi>at the place where the</hi> Fire <hi>began, when carried thither.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>IN obedience to an Order directed to me, from the Honourable Committee of the House of Commons, then sitting in the Speakers Chamber of the second of</hi> October, 1666. <hi>I did carry</hi> Robert Hubert <hi>to St.</hi> Katherines-Tower <hi>by Water, to let me know the place where the</hi> Swedish <hi>Ship lay, that brought him and other</hi> Frenchmen <hi>from</hi> Stockholm, <hi>and he brought me to the Dock over-against Mr.</hi> Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellis, <hi>his Brew-house, and did then verifie to me, and Mr.</hi> Corsellis, <hi>That the Ship lay there, until such time as he with Mr.</hi> Piedelou <hi>and others did go and set fire to a House. And this</hi> Hubert <hi>did then further say, That Mr.</hi> Piedelou <hi>did fix two Fire-Balls to a long Pole, and put them into a Window; and that he the said</hi> Robert Hubert <hi>did fire one in the same manner, and put it in at the same VVindow. But with all the inquiry and diligence that I could use, I could neither find nor hear of any such Vessel. And from thence I carried the said</hi> Robert Hubert <hi>to</hi> Tower-Hill, <hi>and did then desire him to shew me the House that they did fire, and he said, That it was near the Bridge. So we went along</hi> Thames-street <hi>towards the Bridge; but before we came to the Bridge, the said</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Hubert <hi>said,</hi> That the House was up there <hi>(pointing with his hand up</hi> Pudding-lane;) <hi>So I bid him go to the place, and he went along the Bricks and Rubbish, and made a stand. Then did I ask one</hi> Robert Penny, <hi>a VVine-Porter, which was the Bakers House? and he told me, That was the House where the aforesaid</hi> Robert Hubert <hi>stood. So I went to</hi> Robert Hubert <hi>and stood by him, and turned my back towards the Bakers House, and demanded of him, which House it was that he fired, (directing to other Houses contrary to that House:) But he turning himself about, said,</hi> This was the House <hi>(pointing to the Bakers House) that was first fired. Then by reason of his lameness I set him on a Horse, and carried him to several other places, but no other place would he acknowledge; but rode back again to the Bakers House, and said again,</hi> That that was the House <hi>(pointing at the Bakers House) And this I do humbly certifie to this Honourable Committee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Be me <hi>Iohn Lowman,</hi> Keeper of his Majesties County-Goal for <hi>Surry.</hi> IT being intimated to the Committee, That notwithstanding the Confession of the said <hi>Hubert,</hi> it was confidently reported the <hi>Fire</hi> in the forementioned <hi>Farryners</hi> house began by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: The Committee therefore sent for him the said <hi>Farryner</hi> before them, who being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, said, <hi>That it was impossible any Fire should happen in his House by accident; for he had after Twelve of the Clock that night gone through every Room thereof, and found no Fire, but in one Chimney, where the Room was paved with Bricks, which Fire he diligently raked up in Embers.</hi> He was then asked, whether no Window or Door might let in wind to disturb those Coals? He affirmed there was no possibility for any wind to disturb them: and that it <hi>was absolutely set on fire of purpose.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note, <hi>That this</hi> Hubert <hi>was some time after Tryed, Condemned and Executed for this Fact, and at his Death did acknowledge and own the doing thereof, and that he was instigated thereunto by Monsieur</hi> Piedelou <hi>as aforesaid.</hi>

                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> one of his Majestie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Justices of the Peace, informed, That he saw a man apprehended in the time of the Fire, near the <hi>Temple,</hi> with his Pockets stuft with <hi>combustible matter,</hi> made of Flax, Tow, and such-like materials.</p>
               <p>Doctor <hi>Iohn Packer</hi> informs, that he saw a Person in the time of the Fire, throw some <hi>combustible matter</hi> into a Shop in the <hi>Old Bayly,</hi> which he thinks was the Shop of an Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and that immediately thereupon he saw a great smoak, and smelt a <hi>smell of Brimstone.</hi> The Person that did this immediately ran away; but upon the out-cry of the People he was taken by the Guards.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Randal,</hi> Mr. <hi>Haslem,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Humphrey Bowyer,</hi> do all agree, That they saw a person flinging something into a House near St. <hi>Antholines</hi> Church; and that thereupon the House was on fire, and the smoak thereof infested the adjacent Houses. And when this was done, there was <hi>No fire near the place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Michael March,</hi> an Officer in the Trained Bands in a Company of Sir <hi>Richard Browns,</hi> apprehended a <hi>Walloon</hi> in the time of the Fire, at the Nags-head in <hi>Leaden-hall-Street,</hi> with an Instrument like a dark Lanthorn, made (as is conceived) to lay a Train of Powder, and it was tilled with Gun-powder. There were two more of the same Nation in his company. They being asked to what use they employed the same Instrument, would give no Account thereof.</p>

                  <hi>Newton Killingworth</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> informed, That he apprehended a person during the Fire about whom he found much <hi>combustible matter,</hi> and certain <hi>black things of a long figure,</hi> which he could not indure to hold in his hands, by reason of their extream heat. This Person was so surprized at first, that he would not answer to any question; But being on his way to <hi>White-hall,</hi> he act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the part of a Mad-man, and so continued while he was with him.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Iohn Maynard,</hi> a Member of this House, affirms, <hi>That he had some of that combustible matter in his hands; and though it were in its natural substance, and unfired, yet the heat of it was scarcely to be endured by the touch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Freeman</hi> of <hi>Southwark</hi> Brewer (whose House was lately fired) informs, <hi>That on the day his House was fired (about a quarter of an hour before that happened) a Paper with a Ball of Wild-fire, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining near a pound weight wrapped in it, was found in the Nave of a Wheel, in a</hi> Wheelers-yard,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48134:9"/>
                  <hi>where lay a great quantity of Timber.</hi> How his House was fired, he knoweth not; but this he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to the Committee, <hi>That it could not be by accident, because there had not been any Candle or Fire in the Housewhere the Hay lay, that whole day; and that the Hay being laid in very dry, and before Midsummer, could not possibly be set on fire within it self.</hi> Moreover he said. <hi>That the Hay-loft was on fire on the top of the House, and that the Fire spread from the one end of the Roof to another in an instant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Richard Harwood</hi> informs, <hi>That being near the</hi> Feathers Tavern <hi>by</hi> St. <hi>Pauls, upon the fourth of</hi> September, <hi>he saw something through a grate in a Cellar, like Wild-fire, by the sparkling and spitting of it, he could judge it to be no other:</hi> Whereupon he gave notice of it to some Souldiers that were near the place, who caused it to be quenched.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I had Order from the Committee to acquaint you, That we traced several Persons apprehended upon strong Suspicion (during the Fire) to the Guards, but could not make further discovery of them.</hi>

               <p>RIchard Bound <hi>saith, That upon</hi> Tuesday <hi>night last about twelve or one of the clock, there was a</hi> Frenchman <hi>brought by the Watch to this Informants Fathers house, being at the sign of the</hi> White-Hart <hi>in</hi> King-street, <hi>taken as a suspicious person: The said person being questioned by them, Whether he was not one of those that Fired the City, or had a hand therein, or any privity or knowledge of any that had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed the same? or words to that effect: The said person answered a great while in a perverse manner, quite different from the question. But being further pressed to tell the truth, and being told, that if be were guilty, it would be the only way to save his life: He did at first obstinately deny, that he knew any thing of any Plot. Whereupon a young man took the Prisoner aside to the end of the Room, and after some private discourse between them, they both returned to this Informant and the rest of the Company, and the said young man spake openly to us, in the hearing of the Prisoner, That the said</hi> Frenchman <hi>and</hi> Prisoner <hi>had confessed,</hi> There were Three hundred Frenchmen that were in a Plot or Conspiracy to fire the City. <hi>Upon which this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant and others spake to the said</hi> Frenchman <hi>in these words or to the same effect:</hi> Well Monsieur, you have done very well to confess what you have done, and no doubt but you may have your Pardon, if you will confess all you know of this Plot: <hi>And thereupon further asked him,</hi> Are there no more than Three hundred persons in the said Plot? <hi>He answered,</hi> There are no more than Three hundred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. <hi>Then we inquired who they were, and how he came to know they were</hi> Three hundred? <hi>To which he would give no direct Answer, but put it off with other extravagant discourse. And being asked, why he came to St.</hi> Giles <hi>Parish (where he was apprehended?) He told a Story, that he came from</hi> Islington-Fields, <hi>where his Masters Goods were: But the Goods were now removed, but he could not tell whither; and that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster bid him go up and down the Fields, but would not declare upon what occasion, or for what end he was so to do: And being asked whether there were</hi> Three hundred <hi>persons engaged in this Design or Plot?

She told her in her ear, <hi>For Burning the City.</hi> Mrs <hi>Eves</hi> afterwards hearing of the firing of <hi>London</hi> (and going to a place where she might behold it) met with Mrs. <hi>Susanna St. George,</hi> and (amongst other discourse) told her how much her Mothers Words, which she spake the <hi>Friday</hi> before, did run in her thoughts; which she repeated to her Daughter: who made this Reply, <hi>That her Mother was very apt to talk, and that sae bid been fain to keep her Mother within doors during the Fire, fearing lest she should talk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this (during the Fire) Mrs <hi>Eves</hi> mer with Mrs. <hi>Cook,</hi> another Popish Recusant, and of the same Family, to whom she also related Mrs. <hi>St. George</hi> her words; who made this return, <hi>That she was a worthy woman to keep Counsel.</hi>

               <p>Also the Lady <hi>St. George</hi> at <hi>Enfield</hi> in the Lord of <hi>Lincoln'</hi>s House, declared to Mrs. <hi>Rebecca Eves</hi> of the said Town, <hi>That within a few dayes the City of</hi> London <hi>would be laid in Ashes.</hi> This was spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken about two dayes before the Fire happened.</p>

               <p>Decemb. 20. 1666. <hi>concerning Mrs.</hi> St. George.</p>
               <p>MRs. <hi>Rebecca Eves</hi> of <hi>Enfield;</hi> three or four days, or within a week before the Fire, receiving a Visit in her own House from Mrs. <hi>St. George</hi> (amongst other Discourses) Mrs. <hi>St. George</hi> akt her what News she heard? and, if she knew when the Parliament sate? Mrs. <hi>Eves</hi> replied she thought shortly. The other asked, <hi>If she heard of any that were to be called in question before the Parliament?</hi> Mrs. <hi>Eves</hi> said, <hi>About what?</hi> Mrs. <hi>St. George</hi> said, <hi>About a I lot.</hi> Mrs. <hi>Eves</hi> asked, <hi>What Plot?</hi> Mrs. <hi>St. George</hi> answered. <hi>About Firing the City</hi> Mrs. <hi>Eves</hi> said, <hi>I hope God will preservs the City, but people use not to be questioned before the fact be committed.</hi> So the Discourse was waved for that time.</p>
               <p>At the time of the Fine, Mrs. <hi>Eves</hi> went out to look towards the Fire, and mentioning Mrs. <hi>St. George,</hi> one in the Company replied behind her (but she cannot certainly fix the person) <hi>A prime Woman, to keep counsel!</hi> After the Fire, Mrs. <hi>St. George</hi> her Daughter came to Mrs <hi>Eves,</hi> who asked her if she remembred what her Mother had said? She said, <hi>My Mother is such a Woman, she will speak what she thinks.</hi> Afterwards she said, <hi>That she had much ado to keep her Mother in at the time of the Fire, lest she should speak some things she should be questioned for.</hi>

A Citizen being burnt out of his House, had hired a Lodging in <hi>Queens-street</hi> in <hi>Covent-Garden;</hi> and going up <hi>Holborn</hi> (there being a Crowd of people) steps in amongst them, and hears a Woman say, that she had a hand in Firing the City. The People askt her, whether she were an Anabaptist? She said No: Are you an Independent? She said No: Are you a Presbyterian? She said No: Are you a <hi>Roman Catholick?</hi> to which she would give no answer. The Citizen asked her, but Mistress had you a hand in Burning the City? She answered, what would you have me say? <hi>I have confessed it already, and do deserve to Dye for it:</hi> this she said with great trembling, and seemed to be much troubled. The Citizen enquired for a Constable, the People reply'd there was one gone for, But a Gallant comes, and takes her by the Arm, and leads her away, saying he would have her examined, and forth with another Gallant closeth with him, and they both carryed her to the <hi>Griffin</hi> Tavern in <hi>Holborn.</hi> The Citizen follows them, to see the result of the business. But, they, with the Master of the House, shut out the Company (all but the Citizen, supposing him to be one of their own Companions) but asking one the other concerning him, and finding him not of them, put him out again. Whereupon he goes to the next Company of Souldiers, and inquires for their Captain, who replyed, he was not there, but told him, Yonder is my Lord <hi>Craven,</hi> unto whom the Citizen repaired, and acquainted his Lordship, That there was a Woman apprehended (and rescued by a couple of Gallants) that had Confessed she had a hand in Burning the City, and was at such a Tavern. Whereupon the Lord <hi>Craven</hi> calls to a Captain in the street, and ordered him to go with that Man and apprehend the Woman that he should direct him to; Whereupon he goes with the Citizen, and takes her with the first Gallant, who stood up highly in her defence, and carries them both to an Alehouse on the other side of the way. The Citizen perceiving that nothing would be done with her, leaves his name with the Captain, and where he might be found, but was never called for to justifie the words spoken by her.</p>
               <p>A Woman standing in <hi>White-Chappel</hi> with a Company about her, was askt what the matter was? She said, that she met two young men in that place, and asked them how it was with the Fire: They answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Its now almost out, if it can be kept so, but the Rogues renew it with their Fireballs.</hi> Ay saith another Woman, Young men, if you have a heart to it, you may be hired to throw <hi>Fire-balls</hi> too; For I know where twenty were hired yesterday to throw them. It was askt her, what was become of the Woman that spake thus? She answered, That she had apprehended her and delivered her to the under Beadle of <hi>White-Chappel-</hi>Parish. The Woman falling under the accusation (not being able to deny it) there being many Witnesses at that time that heard it: She was delivered to Sir <hi>John Robinson,</hi> but heard of no more.</p>

                  <hi>A true Relation made by one of the Grand Jury, at</hi> Hicks Hall, <hi>at a general Quarter-Sessions, presently after the Fire in</hi> London.</p>
               <p>THat near <hi>West-Smithfield</hi> in <hi>Cheek Lane,</hi> there was a man taken in the very Act of firing a House, by the Inhabitants and Neighbours; and carrying him away through <hi>Smithfield,</hi> to have him before a Justice for the fact committed, The Kings Life Guard perceiving it, made up unto them, and demanded their Prisoner from them; but they refused to let him go. The Life-Guard men told them, That he was one of the Kings Servants, and said, <hi>We will have him;</hi> and thereupon they drew out their Swords and Pistols, and rescued him out of the peoples hands by force of Arms.</p>
               <p>A Bill of Indictment was brought against him, and two or three Witnesses did swear unto it, and the Bill was found by the Grand Jury, who did carry it to the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> and presented to the Lord Chief Justice; but it came to no further Tryal, nor was ever seen after at the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> so far as this person upon his best enquiry could ever hear or learn.</p>

                  <hi>Concerning a House-keeper at</hi> So-ho, <hi>who fired his own Dwelling-House.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FIrst he secured all his Goods in his Garden, and then went in and fired his House; which when he had done, he endeavoured to get away out at his Fore Door. A Neighbour demanded of him who had fired his House? He answered, <hi>The Devil.</hi> Upon that, his Neighbour bid him stand, or he would run his Halbert into his guts. His answer was, <hi>If you do, there are enough left behind me to do the work.</hi> Whereupon he was secured, and a Bill of Indictment brought against him, and about three Witnesses did swear to it, and his Son came in a Witness against him, who was demanded by the Foreman, What he could say as to the firing of his Fathers House? He said, that <hi>his Father did fire it with a Fire-ball.</hi> It was demanded of him, whether he did fire it above stairs, or below? He answered, <hi>Above-stairs.</hi> The
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48134:11"/>
Bill was likewise found; but the Petty-Jury being too much influenced and over-awed by the L. C. J. <hi>K.</hi> did not find him guilty.</p>

                  <hi>Humphrey Ayrs</hi> of <hi>White-Lion-Court</hi> in <hi>Barbican</hi> Porter is ready to depose upon Oath, That on the third of <hi>September</hi> 1666, being the Monday, at which time the Fire was as farre off as <hi>Walbrook,</hi> he coming to <hi>Budge-Row,</hi> and no Fire near that he could perceive, on a sudden he saw two houses about the middle of <hi>Budge-Row,</hi> betwixt St. <hi>Antholines</hi> Church and <hi>Walbrook</hi> break out in a light fire in their middle stories, before ever the tops of the said Houses catcht or were toucht with fire, so that they burnt downwards till the Roof fell into the Fire.</p>
               <p>The like is attested by <hi>Mr. Morton</hi> a Gold-smith near the end of <hi>Foster-Lane,</hi> who averrs, that the people that dwelt in <hi>Aldersgate,</hi> having removed their Goods and abandoned the same, he on a sudden saw a fire in one of the Rooms, which must needs be set on fire as well because there was no other fire near thereabouts at that time, nor for many hours after, as also for that it began not on the top but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and so flam'd forth through the very stones; But by his calling out for help it was for that time Quencht, though afterwards fired again; It being so convenient for their purpose, who design'd to have carryed on the flames further up <hi>Aldersgate-street,</hi> though in that respect God prevented them.</p>
               <p>In the same manner A Person of eminent Quality, and another very worthy Gentleman both then of the <hi>Temple,</hi> have attested, that in that fire in 1666, they saw the fire break out at the <hi>Temple</hi> when no fire was near, nor could they possibly make any reasonable apprehension how from the common Conflagrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any fire should reach thither, or catch at the place where they observ'd it to break out.</p>

                  <hi>In the time of the Fire a Constable took a</hi> Frenchman <hi>firing a House, seized on him, and going to a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate with him, met with His Royal Highness the Duke of</hi> York, <hi>who asked the reason of the tumuit: One told him that a</hi> Frenchman <hi>was taken firing a House; his Highness called for the man, who spake to him in</hi> French. <hi>The Duke asked, Who would attest it? The Constable said,</hi> I took him in the Act, and I will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test it. <hi>The Duke took him into his custody, and said,</hi> I will secure him. <hi>But he was heard of no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On <hi>Munday</hi> the third of <hi>September,</hi> there was a <hi>Frenchman</hi> taken firing a House; and upon searching of him, Fire-Balls were found about him. At which time four of the Life-Guard rescued the <hi>Frenchman,</hi> and took him away from the People, <hi>after their usual manner in the whole time of the Fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One Mr. <hi>Belland</hi> a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> living at <hi>Maribone,</hi> who bought great store of Pastboard for a consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time before the fire in the City of <hi>London,</hi> to the quantity of twenty gross in one Shop, and much more elsewhere, was asked by a Citizen, What he did with all that Pastboard? He answered that he made <hi>Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works for the Kings pleasure.</hi> The Citizen asked him, What doth the King give you? He replyed, <hi>Nothing, onely I have Respects at Court:</hi> The Citizen said, <hi>Take heed, Mr.</hi> Belland, <hi>you do not expend your estate, and then lose your Respects at Court, for you are at a great charge. Belland</hi> answered, <hi>Sir, do you think this a great matter? I use all this my self; But if you did see all the great quantities I have made elsewhere, in three several places, three, four, and five miles off, you would say something.</hi> Another time, the Stationer with whom he dealt for Pastboard, being at his House in <hi>Maribone,</hi> and wondring at the many thousands of Fire Works that lay piled up of several sorts, he said, <hi>Sir, do you wonder at this? if you should see the quantity that I have made elsewhere by other men, you would WONDER INDEED.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Sunday</hi> before the Fire began, this <hi>Belland</hi> came to the Shop where he was wont to buy his Past<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, but the Stationer being not there, he desired a Citizen (the Stationers Neighbour) to speak to him, and to let him know that he had much wronged him in disappointing him of the four gross of Pastboard which he should have had of him and said that he should not do his work by the time and that if he had it not by Tuesday night, it would come too late, he should have no occasion for it after that (which was the Tuesday night before the the Fire) Mr. <hi>Belland</hi> (said the Citizen) what is the reason of your hast? Have you any Shew suddenly before the King? At which he blusht, and would give no answer. Says the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen, <hi>What kind of Fire-works do you make, onely such as will crack and run?</hi> Belland answered, <hi>I make of all sorts; some that will burn and make no crack at all, but will flye up in in a pure body of flame, higher then the top of</hi> Pauls, <hi>and waver in the Ayre.</hi> Says the Citizen, Mr. <hi>Belland,</hi> when you make your Shew, shall I see it? Yes, said <hi>Belland,</hi> I promise you, and gave him his hand upon it. Which Citizen in the time of the Fire, being upon the <hi>Thames</hi> in a Boat, saw, to his great amazement, sundry bodies of fire, burning above the Fire of the Houses <hi>as high again as Pauls wavering in the Ayre,</hi> directly according to <hi>Bellands</hi> description.</p>
               <p>And after the Burning of the City, the Stationer and the other Citizen agreed to go to <hi>Maribone,</hi> to speak with this <hi>Belland;</hi> and by the way met with his two Maids and his Boy: And having some know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them, asked for young Mr. <hi>Belland,</hi> who told them he was not at home, neither knew they where he was. But the Citizens observing that they carryed with them Rabbets and Capons ready drest, concluded, they were going to him, and told them so. Whereat, they were surly and bad them go look him, for they would not tell them where he was. Upon that, the Citizens resolved to follow them, and did, till they came to <hi>Whitehall.</hi> The Servants went up stairs and down stairs, on purpose to have lost them, but could not, for they kept close to them. And at last, one of the Maids went to a door and knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Crying out, <hi>They were dogg'd by two men, that they could not be rid of;</hi> With that young Mr. <hi>Belland</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:48134:11"/>
opened the door saying to one of the Citizens, <hi>Sir your Servant, how do you do?</hi> One of them answered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Both I and many Thousand Families more are the worse for you; for you under pretence of making Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works for the King, have Destroyed a Famous City, and Ruined a Noble People.</hi> To which <hi>Belland</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes. <hi>I make nothing but Innocent Things, that will do no harm; for which I have a Pattent from the King.</hi> But the Citizen answered, <hi>If the King gave you a Pattent, it was but for your self:</hi> Who answered, <hi>No.</hi> Then said the Citizen, <hi>What made you then to imploy so many men, in so many places?</hi> No, said <hi>Belland, I set no man to work, neither know I any Man that makes of them, but my self;</hi> though he had often before said otherwise. While they were thus discoursing, Old <hi>Belland</hi> looks from under the Hanging, Sir, said he, <hi>I hear you charge my Son with Suspition of Burning the City, I pray you speak lower</hi> (casting his Eyes about, fearing the Ladies passing by might hear) and said, <hi>My Son doth nothing but what he hath a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent from the King for, and shall have an Order to S<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>A House in</hi> Shooe-lane <hi>fired by a French-man taken in the Act, yet discharged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ON <hi>Tuesday</hi> the <hi>4th.</hi> of <hi>September</hi> 1666. A <hi>French-man</hi> was taken for Firing the <hi>Turn-broach</hi> of the <hi>Temples</hi> house, in <hi>Robin-hood-court</hi> in <hi>Shooe-lane</hi> where he lodged. This Court was full of pitiful rotten houses, and he did the fact early in the morning before ever any fire was come over <hi>Fleet bridge</hi> or cross the Ditch; but the woman being up and perceiving it just as he was going forth, cryed out to one Mr. <hi>Nicasius</hi> a neighbour who was then in that Court, <hi>saying,</hi> This Rogue hath fired my house, and withal came running out of the house into the Court after him, thereupon Mr. <hi>Nicasius</hi> seized the Fellow, talkt French to him, searcht his pockets and found a writing purporting to be Indentures of Covenant for him and another to serve one <hi>Glowde Lantee</hi> of the Parish of St. <hi>Leonard Shoreditch</hi> French-fring-maker for 10 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> wages, dated <hi>10th.</hi> of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1665. Attested by <hi>John Underwood</hi> publick Notary and <hi>Joshuah Thirk<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

'Tis uncertain whether his name was <hi>Martin de Humet,</hi> or <hi>Andrew Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,</hi> because they were both parties to the same Indented Articles, but 'tis more probable it was <hi>de Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> because the same is a French, whereas <hi>Sommers</hi> is an English name. This person being so taken in the Fact, was askt if he were a Frenchman which he acknowledged, the people would presently have used violence to him, but Mr. <hi>Nicasius</hi> with much ado perswaded them to the contrary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and got their leave to be patient that he might carry him before the Duke of <hi>York</hi> whom he found with his Guard about <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury Court,</hi> to him he presented the French man, and related the Fact with its apparent circumstances in English<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on which the Duke called one of the Horse Guard, and delivered him unto him, who rode a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with him triumphantly towards <hi>Westminster.</hi> The <hi>Mounsieurs</hi> about the Duke making a great noise at his delivery, but the next morning Mr. <hi>Nicasius</hi> enquired what became of the French-man, and the people told him he was let go, nor hath he since been heard of by Mr. <hi>Nicasius</hi> though he hath used means to inquire and find him out. The <hi>Turn-broaches</hi> house consisted only of two Rooms, the uppermost of which was the Chamber in which this French-man lay, and which he had fired, and carried away the key with him, but the people perceiving it so soon, broke open the Chamber, and had happily quencht the same before Mr. <hi>Nicasius</hi> came back from carrying him before the Duke of <hi>York.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The same Mr. <hi>Nicasius</hi> had a fair brick house wherein he dwelt, being the furthest house on the right hand in <hi>Plow yard</hi> in <hi>Fetter-lane</hi> adjoyning to <hi>Thavies-Inn Garden,</hi> this house on the wednesday was by ill Councel ordered to be blown up, and Powder brought to that purpose, which if it had been done, the fire had undoubtedly proceeded much further: But upon his representing the unreasonableness thereof to the King, and that if by playing with the engine on an house hard by that was on fire, they could so damp the flames that they might not seize his house, then the same being brick would screen and preserve other paper Buildings behind it, his Majesty was pleased to order that course should be taken, and thereby that house and divers others were saved, Though in Mr. <hi>Nicasius</hi> occasional absence for a very short time peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple got into his house with strange pickaxes, and battle-axes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wherewith they broke open his doors, and (besides what they robbed him of,) brake down all his windows, and threw a press Cupboard, Pictures and other combustibles into the fire to encrease it, and endeavoured to break down the Turret on the top of the house and did actually break some part of it, which could not be but on purpose to let in the fire and that it might the sooner take hold on such his house, which if it had done 'tis most probable all <hi>Holborn</hi> had been destroyed.</p>

                  <hi>The Information of</hi> Thomas Middleton <hi>Chyrurgeon, of St.</hi> Brides, London.</p>
               <p>I The said <hi>Thomas Middleton</hi> do hereby certifie, that upon the Sunday in the afternoon (the day wherein the dreadful fire brake out in <hi>Pudding lane</hi> which consumed the City) hearing the general outcry, that the City was fired by <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> I repaired to the top of a Church steeple near the <hi>Three Cranes</hi> in the <hi>Vintrey,</hi> where my self and several others observed the motion of the <hi>Fire</hi> for two or three hours together, and we all took notice, that the <hi>Fire</hi> did break forth out of several houses, when the houses which were then burning were at a good distance from them every way, and more particularly, I saw the fire break out from the inside of <hi>Lawrence-Pountney</hi> Steeple, when there was no fire near it. These and such like Observations begat in me a Perswasion, that the <hi>Fire</hi> was maintained by design. Upon <hi>Munday</hi> I repaired again into the City, and found as the day before, that the <hi>Fire</hi> did break forth in fresh houses at a great distance one from another. And as I was returning home, passing through <hi>Wailing-street</hi> by a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco Merchants house, I saw the Master of the house come down stairs, driving a young fellow before him, saying to him, <hi>You Rogue, do you come to Rob me? what did you do in my Garret?</hi> or words to that purpose, and pushed him out of doors: All which I observed, and he seemed to be a Frenchman: He was a short black fellow of about 22 years of Age: and as soon as he was out of the house, he having a loose
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48134:12"/>
coat on, in a way of Privacy, Shuffles something under his Coat, whereupon I laid hold of him, and said, <hi>Sirrah, what have you there?</hi> the fellow replyed, <hi>What is that to you, the Master of the House knows me?</hi> Upon that I asked the Mr. of the House whether he knew the fellow, he answered, <hi>he knew him not.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I searched the fellow, and found a horn of powder about him, and as soon as the powder was discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he sell a rubbing his hands, they being all black with powder: He had also about him a book intituled, <hi>The Jewish Government.</hi> I charged him that he was a Frenchman, because he spake broken English; but he denyed it, and did much Vaunt himself. There coming a Constable by with his staffe, I Required him to carry him to Prison, and I would assist him; So we conveyed him to <hi>Old Bridewel,</hi> and by the way, the People were ready to kill him, calling him <hi>French-Raskal.</hi> I prayed them to forbear, for Justice would give him his Reward. I told the fellow he would be hanged: he made slight of it, saying, <hi>If I die my Soul stall be Saved, but yours shall be Damned.</hi> And when he was put into <hi>Bridewel,</hi> I desired that he might be secured and none suffered to speak with him, till he were Examined before a Magistrate, because the Tobacco-Merchants House was presently Burned upon it. But so it happned, on the next day that the fire came on and consumed my House and Goods, so that I was forced with my Family to fly into the Country, and what became of the Fellow I know not, <hi>Old Bridewel</hi> being burnt also. And understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Parliament hath appointed a Committee to enquire after the Actors in, and Fomenters of that Terrible Fire, I thought good to inform the Honourable Committee thereof, that they may send for the Keeper of the said <hi>Bridewel,</hi> to know what became of the Fellow, that he might receive Justice accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his demerit. Thus much I thought my self obliged to do, as in duty bound to God and my Country. All which I am ready to affirm upon Oath, when I shall be thereunto called.</p>

               <head>A further True Relation made by the said <hi>Thomas Middleton,</hi> concerning some occurrences in the great Fire of <hi>London.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>THat upon Monday the 3d. of Sept.</hi> 1666, <hi>being next day after that dreadful fire began, the Duke of</hi> York <hi>being at</hi> Fleet-bridge <hi>in the afternoon, and the fire not being then come to Ludgate, did declare that those Houses adjoyning upon the bridge should be pulled down the next morning, amongst which was the said</hi> Tho. Middletons, <hi>who thereupon endeavour'd that night to get Carts to carry away his Goods, and had got a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Cart and loaded it with Goods, but by that time the same was done, there was a strong Guard set a Cross the street, from</hi> Shoe-Lane <hi>to</hi> Salisbury-Court, <hi>which the said</hi> T. M. <hi>perceiving caused the Cart to be driven up to</hi> Shoe-lane, <hi>and then he with other Neighbours, (one of which was Mr.</hi> William Wheatly <hi>a Common Council-man) repaired to the Captain of the Guard of Horse under the aforesaid Duke being then in</hi> Salisbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-Court, <hi>whose name was</hi> Peters, <hi>whom the said</hi> T. M. <hi>acquainted, That dwelling on</hi> Fleet-bridge, <hi>and there being order given by the Duke that his House amongst others should be pulled down next morning, He therefore prayd that the man which had his load of goods in his cart in order to remove them, might have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to pass and repass through the Guard to fetch the remaining part of his goods, he having a large house and many loads in it, But the said Captain peremptorily denyed such his request, declaring that no cart should pass, except there were an order shewed from the Duke, whereas it was then about</hi> 12 <hi>a Clock in the night, and the Duke at</hi> Whitehall, <hi>or some where else, not easily to be met with, so that it was in possible to procure such an Order so suddenly; whereupon the said</hi> T. M. <hi>earnestly desired that the cart might be admitted to pass, and offered money for the same, and said that for as much as the Capt. and his souldiers could not save his house, he hoped that they would not be instrumental for the destroying of his goods, Adding that he thought he might have some kindness shew'd him in such a difficult hour, for as much as not long before he had voluntarily lent his Majesty Money. The man that owed the Cart standing by all the while, when at last he saw it would not be granted, said it was a very hard thing that when a man cannot save his House, he should be hindred from sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Goods. To which Captain</hi> Peters <hi>answered, why your Cart has carryed one Load, which the man acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, the</hi> Captain replyed, Then you have done enough, your spokes may be knockt out and your Cart burnt: <hi>So with these unnatural and unchristian Replies</hi> Thomas Middleton <hi>returns to his house where he was not long before some of those destroyers were got on the top of it, throwing the Tiles and bricks down the stairs, so that the said</hi> T. M. <hi>and his Family were forced to leave his house and most of his Goods to be consumed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He likewise further saith, <hi>That within a little time after the flames were over, he the said</hi> T. M. <hi>with his Son going near the ground where his house had lately stood, saw a Man that bad took up a Musquet that lay in the Ruines not burnt, and as the said</hi> T. M. <hi>was coming towards him, he saw him take the Musquet, and break it, whereupon the said</hi> T. M. <hi>asked him wherefore he did so, and the fellow replyed, and said it was no matter if Thousands of them were destroyed, or words to that purpose, upon which the said</hi> T. M. <hi>asked him what he was that would destroy the Arms of the King? supposing they were some of the Souldiers Arms, to which he replyed that he did belong to a Major or Coll. whose name the said</hi> T. M <hi>doth not now remember, but</hi> T. M. <hi>did tell the said Fellow that he was a Papist, which proved true, for the said</hi> T. M. <hi>and others searching his pockets, found therein a Mass-book Printed in Latine, with a particular Prayer for the Queen of</hi> Spain, <hi>&amp;c. In the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim comes a Captain, to whom the said</hi> T.

               <p>IN the time of the Fire, near <hi>Bridewell,</hi> there was a man sadly bemoaning the great Loss he was like to sustain (the Fire being within five or six houses of him) who did beseech the people for Gods sake, they having no Goods of their own in danger, to help him throw out Trunks, Chests, Beds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> out at a window, having procured two <hi>Carts</hi> or <hi>Waggons</hi> to carry them away. Whereupon I ran into his House with several others, broke down his Windows, threw out his Goods, and loaded the Carts; and there being some interval of time before the return of the Carts, and seeing a Room wherein were many Books and loose Papers (which seemed to be a Library) I went in and took down a Book, which prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be <hi>Ovid Metamorphosis,</hi> and while I was looking upon it, there came into the same Room an Old Man of Low Stature, with a white Frock, who looked also on the Book as it was in my hand; I took him in my mind to be some Groom come out of a Stable, and thought him to be presumptuously foolish, supposing such a mean like Old Man ignorant of that Language in which the book was written, it being in Latin, but I spoke not to him: In the mean time, there brake sorth a Fire amongst the Papers which were behind us, there being none in the Room but he and I. Whereupon the rest of the people coming in, cryed out, we had set the Room on fire, and rushing in upon us, put out the fire with their Feet: whereupon I took hold of the Old Man by the Buttons under the throat, and said, <hi>How now Father, it must either be you or I must fire these Papers.</hi> There was a small thing of a black matter, which looked like a piece of a Link burning, which questionless set fire on the Papers, but it was immediately trod our. A multitude of people thronged in; and when I said, <hi>How now my Father,</hi> and took hold of him, he said, <hi>Parce mihi Domine:</hi> The people which did not understand it, cryed out, <hi>He is a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, kill him,</hi> and with pulling of him, his Perriwig fell off; then appeared a Bald Skull, and under his Frock he had Black Clothes, I think of Bishops Sattin, whereupon he seemed to be a grave Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick Person. I had much a do to save him from the People, but at last brought him before the Duke of <hi>York:</hi> we found in his Pocket a bundle of Papers closed up with Wax like a Pacquet, which was delivered to the Duke of <hi>York.</hi> I know not what was written in them, neither do I know what Country-man he was; but methoughts he looked something Jesuit-like. This I am certain of, that when I went into the Room there was no fire in it, and it was fired when there was none but he and I in it, yet I cannot say I saw him do it, though I cannot but suspect he did it, and the rather, because there were several houses untouched betwixt this house, and where the fire was coming on, when the Papers in the Library where thus on fire as I have related. What became of this fellow after we had delivered him to his Royal Highness the Duke of York, I have not heard.</p>

Thus we see, that then, even presently after that dreadful Calamity, there wanted not various proofs of its being contrived and carryed on by Popish Treachery: By what means these Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were smothered, 'tis not my business now to inquire; 'tis certain, had they been sufficiently taken notice of, and encouraged, and due prosecution made thereupon, it might have prevented many mischiefs which since happened: But we have now a more full discovery of that villanous Intrigue from their own Mouths; for as I my self have more than once heard them own and boast of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit, so nothing can be more plain than what Dr. <hi>Oaets</hi> hath made out in his Depositions Sworn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that worthy and since Marty'd Gentleman, <hi>Sir Edmondbury Godfrey,</hi> on the <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> last, Paragraph 34, To this effect:</p>
               <p>That in <hi>Iuly</hi> 1678, <hi>Richard Strang,</hi> the then last Provincial of the Jesuits, did tell him, That their Society of Jesuits did get 14 thousand pounds in that Fire in 66, and that he the said <hi>Strang,</hi> with three other Jesuits and a <hi>Dominican</hi> Fryar, all there named; designed, and were chief Instruments in effcting the same; That they intended to have Burnt it sooner, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Feb.</hi> 1664, but had not then got persons and things ready for Execution: That they commonly met at the <hi>Green-Dragon</hi> at <hi>Puddle-Dock,</hi> and pretending themselves <hi>Fifth-Monarchy-men,</hi> first drew in one <hi>Green</hi> a poor man, by fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing him with 30l. to joyn in the Plot of Firing the City, and killing the King, who soon after brought in 8 more of the same Gang; but at last some notice was taken of their Design, and away the Jesuits are gone, leaving the poor silly seduced new Brethren of the <hi>Fifth-Monarchy</hi> to suffer for their Roguery, and accordingly 8 of them were Executed in <hi>May</hi> 66, but never spoke a word of the said Fathers, nor indeed could they, for they knew not their true Names, nor ever suspected them to be Jesuits or Papists, whereupon the said <hi>Strang</hi> further said, That he himself and the others returned again in <hi>Iune</hi> following, and fell again to prosecute their Design, which had been carried on in the mean time by others of their Society. In short, he said they got 50 or 60 <hi>Irish,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>French,</hi> who were very faithful to ply the work, and got one <hi>Everard,</hi> who was chief Keeper of their Fire-works, a place in the Kings Service, relating to the publick Ammunition, the better to colour it; That himself by the Name of <hi>Walker,</hi> and the said <hi>Fryaer,</hi> took a Lodging in <hi>Aug.</hi> 66. in <hi>Fanchurch-street,</hi> that they might be at hand, it having before been resolved where they should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin; That all things being thus prepared, one <hi>Neal</hi> of <hi>VVhite-Chappel,</hi> whose charge it was to see the Fire carried on through <hi>Thames-street</hi> to the <hi>Tower,</hi> called him up about 12 a Clock, and before he could make him ready, the Fire was begun; That there was Fourscore or upwards imployed therein as Servants by the Society, and that they spent 700 Fire-balls, and had others, both Men and Women, attending to Plunder what they could, having a Warehouse in <hi>VVild-street,</hi> and another at <hi>Somerset-house,</hi> to receive what they so got, which amounted to the value of 14000 pounds, as aforesaid, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Fifth-Monarchy-men</hi> that were Executed, mentioned by the said <hi>Strang</hi> to Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> in this Discourse, 'Tis very observable what Account the <hi>Gazett</hi> gave of their Tryal.</p>

3. The Jesuits herein Acted with that Devilish Policy, which is so much the Study of their Society; for having such an horrid Plot, on Foot, they thought fit to find out some other Party, upon whom they might lay the Scandal of it, but it seems could meet with none so ready to be Bubbled as the <hi>Fifth-Monarchy-men;</hi> For, said the subtle Fathers, if we can perswade them to the Business, <hi>viz.</hi> Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the City, and Killing the King, Then not only our work will be done to out hands, but we shall have an excellent occasion to fall not only on these people, but whoever else we shall please to call Fanaticks, as their Accomplices; and all the World shall acknowledge, that we do but Justice in cutting them off, when they shall be made guilty of such Treason and Villany. On the other side, if they attempt and fail in it, Let the <hi>Rogues Hang,</hi> we and our Church are free, both from the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and the <hi>Odium</hi> of it; Nay more, we shall gain this advantage, That when we shall do it in earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, 'twill certainly be laid at their Doors, because of their former Attempt, and to load them the heavier, they had set down the Names of all the most eminent Dissenters, and such as had serv'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Parliament, as concern'd in this Plot, and left it with these people, That as a List of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators, it might be taken with them, and consequently all those persons secured in Custody at a time when they design'd the <hi>French,</hi> with whom we were then at War, should invade the Kingdom; and I am credibly inform'd, they had all been taken, had not his Grace, the late Duke of <hi>Albemarle</hi> Interposed.</p>

As they had to do with ignorant Enthusiastical people, so they managed them accordingly; Telling them a Story of an <hi>Equal Division of Lands,</hi> a Councel of Great Ones that must be name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, and another yet greater that sate with the States; But especially they forgat not to name the <hi>Third of September</hi> to them, being the day or next save one, themselves had so long pitcht upon for the Burning of <hi>London;</hi> and for this purpose, the Oracle, <hi>Lillies Almanack,</hi> must be consulted, but indeed, it was the Astrology of St. <hi>Omars</hi> that resolved the Question; for they did this meerly, that if they should be discovered, that circumstance should likewise be divulged as part of this, <hi>Fifth-Monarchy-Plot,</hi> and consequently being remembred by people when they should see the City on Fire, They might thence take occasion to fall upon the Fanaticks as the Incendiaries; and 'tis more than probable, that not finding these Half-witted Fellows very fit to serve their Purposes actively, They resolved to make them do it passively, and might themselves cause them to be betray'd, it being nothing infrequent with the Jesuits to imitate their Father the Devil, in tempting people first to Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany, and then to be the first that shall accuse them.</p>

them, he was seized, and carried to a Foot-Company that stood in Arms near the said Inn, and a Charge given them by my Lord <hi>Craven</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Smith,</hi> then one of the Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> to keep him safe; after the Fire was put out, enquiry being made for him, the Captain told them he was discharged by the Lord <hi>Craven.</hi> However, on the 27 of <hi>July,</hi> being informed he taught School in <hi>Thredneedle-street,</hi> he was retaken, and examined before the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen, where the following Articles were prov'd against him upon Oath.</p>

                  <hi>The Information of</hi> Thomas Roe <hi>of</hi> Bernards Inn <hi>Gent. taken the 30th of</hi> July 1690 <hi>by Sir</hi> John Fredrick, <hi>Alderman, one of His Majesties Justices of Peace in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of</hi> London, <hi>upon Oath, as followeth.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>THomas Roe</hi> saith, that he hath for at least twelve or thirteen years last past been acquainted with one <hi>Ioseph Harrison,</hi> who was examined lately at the Guild-Hall <hi>London,</hi> before the Honourable the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen, upon suspition of his being a Conspirator in the Fireing the City and Suburbs in several parts thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas Roe,</hi> and <hi>Ioseph Harrison,</hi> having been School-fellows at <hi>Eaton Colledge,</hi> and being thereby acquainted; <hi>Ioseph Harrison</hi> hath several times lately been with him, and advised him to with-draw his Concerns, and remove above twenty miles out of the City; for that the City, and twenty miles round. would be suddenly destroyed and laid waste (or to that purpose:) Whereupon <hi>Thomas Roe</hi> asked him, whether he were privy to any such conspiracy, or concern'd in its Agitation? pressing him with divers Arguments to discover what he was acquainted with of that kind. <hi>Harrison</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, That he had no personal and positive knowledge thereof. <hi>Thomas Roe</hi> demanded upon what ground then he did thus advise him? <hi>Ios. Harrison</hi> replyed, That he was sometimes conversant among some <hi>Papists,</hi> and perceived a Plot or Design was carrying on by them against the City of <hi>London</hi> and the <hi>Protestant Religion;</hi> which Plot or design (said he) the <hi>Papists</hi> call, <hi>The Game of Trap,</hi> or, do you understand <hi>Trap ad Crucem?</hi> which is the watch-word amongst them. Further, <hi>Ios. Harrison</hi> said, That he was informed of those things by some <hi>German Protestants,</hi> and that he had offers of fifty pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> made him by some <hi>Iesuites</hi> and <hi>Papists,</hi> to turn to their Religion; but he had refused it, and would not embrace the Romish Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas Roe</hi> further saith, That about five weeks since, he walked through <hi>New-Cheapside;</hi> and from thence into <hi>Mark-lane,</hi> with <hi>Ioseph Harrison,</hi> in company with Mr. <hi>Moseley</hi> (a Gentleman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to <hi>Bernards Inn</hi> likewise) and one of his acquaintance, together with another man, a stranger to <hi>Thomas Roe.</hi> Upon their first associating, <hi>Harrison</hi> said unto him, That he would not discover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be an <hi>Englishman,</hi> but pretended himself to be a <hi>German</hi> or <hi>Italian,</hi> (whether of the two he doth not well remember) and that he might not detect himself, spake in the company, as occasion offer'd, in <hi>Latine.</hi> But leaving the place where they tarried in <hi>Mark-lane,</hi> going towards <hi>Bishopsgate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>street,</hi> Mr. <hi>Harrison</hi> told Mr. <hi>Roe</hi> secretly, That he believed that Mr. <hi>Mosely</hi> understood the Game of <hi>Trapp</hi> by some signs he had observed from him, and that he would try him. Then going altogether into a house, about the end of <hi>Thredneedle-street,</hi> Mr. <hi>Harrison</hi> (having by this time discovered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48134:14"/>
to be an <hi>Englishman)</hi> said <hi>Trapp,</hi> and made a Cross over his face with his finger; directing himself to Mr. <hi>Moseley;</hi> whereupon Mr. <hi>Moseley</hi> did also say <hi>Trapp,</hi> crossing his forehead or race two or three times, and with a quick motion drew his finger over his own Throat. Upon which, Mr. <hi>Roe</hi> asked Mr. <hi>Moseley</hi> what was the meaning of <hi>Trapp?</hi> but he refused to tell, Mr. <hi>Roe</hi> urging him again, He replied, He would not, saying, You are not of my Religion. Then Mr. <hi>Moseley</hi> asked Mr. <hi>Harrison</hi> what his Name was? (for he knew him not by Name) He answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Harrison.</hi> Mr. <hi>Moseley</hi> replied, I never saw your Name. Mr. <hi>Harrison</hi> made answer, Is it <hi>Don Olanso del Harrisonto;</hi> if so, saith Mr. <hi>Moseley,</hi> I have seen your Name.</p>
               <p>After this, Mr. <hi>Moseley</hi> and the other stranger being parted, and Mr. <hi>Roe</hi> and Mr. <hi>Harrison</hi> being alone, said <hi>Harrison,</hi> I told you Mr. <hi>Moseley</hi> did understand <hi>Trapp;</hi> you may see there is a List of the <hi>Trapp-Gamesters.</hi> Now, whether Mr. <hi>Moseley</hi>'s imitation of Mr. <hi>Harrison</hi> was feigned or real, Mr. <hi>Roe</hi> could not distinguish; but as they two were passing through <hi>Cheapside</hi> homewards, Mr. <hi>Harrison</hi> looking upon the New-Buildings, said, To what purpose do they Build this poor City? it will again be destroyed; at the same time he pointed at two several persons, saying, That is a <hi>Trapp-Gamester,</hi> and there goes another <hi>Trapp-Gamester.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Roe</hi> further informs, That since the last Term, Mr. <hi>Harrison</hi> told him, he would write all the Rogueries of the <hi>Trapp-Game</hi> and <hi>Gamesters</hi> in a <hi>Play;</hi> and that he would undertake to shew him Twenty six Papists Meetings in and about the City and Suburbs of <hi>London;</hi> but (said he) some of them are very private, and if you be discovered not to be a Papist, you will (peradventure) be poysoned or stab'd.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Roe</hi> doth further say, That when the said <hi>Harrison</hi> advised him to Remove with all his Concerns above Twenty Miles from <hi>London,</hi> the said <hi>Roe</hi> asked him if <hi>Windsor</hi> were not far enough, it being both their Native place, and about that distance? The said <hi>Harrison</hi> answered, Not; reflecting upon the Castle. And further, <hi>Harrison</hi> told Mr. <hi>Roe,</hi> That the Jesuits by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of Ingredients, make such a Matter, the Fume of which would corrupt any mans In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellects; and that he the said <hi>Harrison</hi> could do it.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Harrison</hi> (who 'tis probable was some Priest, or at least Proselyte) as you have heard, was committed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> but we cannot learn there was any legal Prosecution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</p>
               <p>The damage of this Fire at the <hi>George-Inne</hi> was considerable, for it Burnt three parts of the said. Inne and 140 Loads of Hay; and at the <hi>White-Hart</hi> there was Burnt and blown up one Stable, one dwelling-house, and 4 or 5 Lodging Chambers. At the <hi>Three-Cranes</hi> near adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the said <hi>George-Inn</hi> on the <hi>North-side,</hi> three dwelling houses and a Still-house; and at the <hi>Talbot</hi> three dwelling houses, a Wash-house, and (which is most lamentable) two persons kill'd out-right, and six or seven wounded.</p>

                  <hi>A Brief Account of a Fire Providentially prevented in</hi> Goat-Yard <hi>near St.</hi> Margarets-Hill <hi>in</hi> Southwark.</head>
               <p>ANother attempt was on <hi>Thursday Aug.</hi> 11. 1670. about 10 of the Clock at Night, a Woman siting at her door in <hi>Goat-yard</hi> aforesaid, heard a great Hissing noise, and turning to see what might be the cause thereof, she saw a light upon a Shed or Hovel in a Wheel-wrights yard, bounding upon the said <hi>Goat-yard,</hi> on which Shed or Hovel were old Wheels, and such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustible stuff, whereupon she cried out Fire; which caused several Neighbours to come forth, who with speedy application of Water, quenched the said Fire; which done, they diligently search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the place, where amongst the old Wheels, they found a <hi>Canvas</hi> Bagg, in which was some Sulphurous matter, compounded with other Ingredients, and about half a Yard of Match tied to it, one end of which said Match had been fired, and on strict observation, several Spoaks had the marks of Fire, and scent of Gunpowder and Sulphur remaining upon them. This villainous Design was mischievously placed for the accomplishing of some great Desolation; for, near adjoyning to the said Shed was a Loft full of Hay, the Boards of it old and dry, and behind the said Shed was also a great quantity of Billets, and adjoyning to that Hay-loft was a Timber-yard, wherein was about an hundred Load of Boards and Timber. A Justice of Peace inhabiting near the said place, had the Match and combustible Matter aforesaid delivered to him, and there are sufficient wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses yet living, of the whole matter, as herein is related.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:48134:15"/>
Several other Attempts were made on <hi>Southwark,</hi> but without any considerable Effect, until the <hi>26th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> 1676. and then they fatally accomplisht their Design, setting Fire to the house of one Mr. <hi>VVelsh</hi> an Oyl-man, scituate near St. <hi>Margarets-Hill,</hi> between the <hi>George</hi> and <hi>Talbot-</hi>Inns, (it seems that was the place ordered by the Superiours) which broke out about four of the Clock in the Morning, and was carried on with that Art and Violence, that it consumed 500 dwelling houses or upwards, many stately Inns, the Meal-market, the Prison of the Compter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The whole Loss, as to what was actually destroyed, was modestly computed to be between Eighty and one hundred thousand pounds, besides damage to the Inhabitants by loss and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of their Trade: St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Hospital was happily preserved, chiefly by means of a new invented Engine for conveying of water, but he that made it, hath since beeen threatned to have his house Burnt for his pains, which has likewise been attempted, as herein after is related: The manner of contriving this Fire hath been confessed by <hi>Iohn Groves</hi> (lately Executed) who was chiefly concern'd therein, and did on the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>August</hi> 1676, in <hi>Wild-house</hi> Garden declare, <hi>That having prepared their Fire-works, he, with three</hi> Irishmen, <hi>procured by Doctor</hi> Fogarthy, <hi>to be his Assistants, went over and did the business; the said</hi> Groves <hi>bragg'd that he himself did set fire to the said Shop;</hi> and by the manner of the thing, 'twas plain, That it must be done by Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery; For most of the Family being out of Town, there had been no Fire in the House for 3 or 4 days before; nor did the Watch that stood hard by all Night, perceive any danger, but the first that perceived it were some Letter-Carriers, who, going early to the Post-Office, as they passed by, saw a great Light at the Cellar Window which opened to the Street, and thereupon look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down, they saw a Fire in the Cellar, but not so great, but if they could presently have got in, they doubted not but three or four pail-fulls of water might have quench'd it; but whilst they stood calling to wake the people who were fast asleep, and endeavour'd in vain to open the street door; The fire got through the Shop-Floor, where meeting with great store of Oyle, it instantly set the Shop and Stairs on a Flame, and the people had much ado to get out at a Window into the <hi>Talbot</hi> Inn to save their Lives. The said <hi>Grove</hi> further declared, that for this Service, the Society <hi>(Richard Strange</hi> then Provincial) gave them a Thousand pounds, <hi>viz.</hi> Four Hundred pounds to him the said <hi>Groves,</hi> and Two Hundred pounds apiece to the three <hi>Irish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;</hi> and yet (besides carrying on their Designe of weakning and impoverishing Protestants) got considerably by the Bargain; for <hi>Groves</hi> affirm'd they got at least Two Thousand pounds by that Fire, for whilst the Fire raged, they had their Instruments to Plunder houses, and Steal what goods they could, and convey them to their Ware-houses at <hi>VVild-street</hi> and <hi>Sommerset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house.</hi> And touching this their gaining Two Thousand Pounds by <hi>Southwark-Fire,</hi> the said <hi>Richard Strange</hi> the Provincial, hath likewise acknowledged it to be true; yet it should seem they were not content with all this Desolation, but endeavoured still to carry it on further; for after the Fire was believ'd to be stopt and Mastered, about 10 a Clock at Night, on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, a House appeared on Fire near St. <hi>Mary Overies</hi> Church, but on the other side thereof furthest from the General-Fire, so that it must needs be wilfully set on Fire, but by blowing up of one house in time, and good Help, it was prevented from spreading further.</p>

               <p>THese were Places that the Conspirators have divers Years resolved should be Destroyed by Fire, and in pursuance thereof, not a few Attempts have been made to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. As,</p>
               <p>First, on the <hi>29th</hi> of <hi>Iune</hi> 1673, there was a Fire promoted over against <hi>VVapping-Dock</hi> in a Bakers-house amongst his <hi>Bavins:</hi> Now that this was wilfully and with Design set on Fire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides what I and others know of such their Resolutions to destroy that place, the circumstances attending it, may easily convince a considerate Impartial man; for about a Month before, there was found in the said heap of <hi>Bavins</hi> a new <hi>Cordevant Glove</hi> full of Gunpowder and other ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, by a Boy that happened to be at Play there, and that very Night it began; there were seen several Gentlemen with Swords by their sides, that had that day been drinking at the <hi>Fortune Tavern</hi> near the place, with some of the Bakers Family, and were seen, in the Evening the Fire happened, to walk round a place called the <hi>New-Market,</hi> which was on the Backside of the Bakers House, and to go in and out towards the Bakers said House backwards, about an

hour or two before it happened, which began on <hi>Saturday.</hi> Night between the hours of Eleven and Twelve, and continued most fiercely Burning till 8 or 9 in the Morning, which made a great Devastation, being no doubt carried on and endeavoured to be Augmented by the Assistance of those wicked Instruments who first occasioned it.</p>
               <p>The great Fire at St. <hi>Katherines</hi> was designed for the Burning of the Ships in the River, though in that respect, by the special Providence of God, and timely Help, there was no mighty mischief done, but on Shore a great number of houses were destroyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shadwell</hi> Fire began at <hi>Shadwell-Dock</hi> in a Brew-house, in which there had not been any Fire for a considerable time, nor can account be given how it should happen by accident, and there-we may probably Assign it to the same mischievous hands.</p>
               <p>But all these mischiefs did not satisfie the Romish undertakers, but they resolv'd on a more general Devastation; For no longer ago than the <hi>30th</hi> of <hi>August</hi> last, the before named <hi>Blundel</hi> at <hi>

               </p>
               <p>And though the Plot were in the mean time partly discovered, yet such was their confidence, that they endeavoured nevertheless to go on with this Design; For on <hi>Wednesday</hi> the <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>Sept.</hi> 1678, a Fire was promoted near <hi>Lime-house,</hi> in pursuance of such their former Order and Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which began there about five of the Clock in the Morning in a Boat-Builders-yard in a parcel of Reeds, which afterwards being increased by certain dryed and seasoned Timber caught hold of a Sea-Captains house with that violence, that the lower part thereof was possest by the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Flames before any of the Family perceived it, or at least could get out; at last Ladders were brought, and two or three of the Servants made shift to get out at the uppermost Windows, but just as they came to save the Mistress of the House and a Servant-Maid which attended her in her Room, the floor of the Chamber in which they were sunk down, and so they both, without any possibility of help, perished. As also an adventurous Seaman, who presuming too far to save some Goods afterwards in another house, was interrupted in his return by one of the Rafters, which falling on his Head, knockt out his Brains. This Fire was carried on very vigorously, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that in three or four hours time, it burnt down and wholly destroyed between 40 and 50 Houses, and had undoubtedly done much more mischief, had not the indefatigable pains and hazards of a great number of Seamen, or rather, the accidental Absence of some of those Agents ordered to promote it as aforesaid, prevented its further Progress.</p>
               <p>But often before this, there were several other Fires, or at least Attempts of that kind, for destroying the Suburbs, as appears by the following Depositions, which deserve our Notice.</p>

The fire was discovered by one of his Maid-servants, who had occasion to carry a Child to Bed, which Bed she found on Fire, and the Chamber so full of smoak, as put her into a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fright; but it being but newly kindled, through the industry of the Family, with the assistance of Neighbours, it was soon extinguished; But this Examinate was so Alarm'd by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected suddenness hereof, and the many fearful occurrences of this kind of late, that he could take no rest in his house, till he had caused narrow search and inspection to be made in every Corner thereof; cleansing it from all such matter as might easily be fired, locking or bolting the doors of every Room where any Bed was, or that was not common for entertainment.</p>
               <p>Yet notwithstanding all this care and vigilance was used, he saith, that the very next day, <hi>viz. Thursday</hi> the fourth of <hi>August</hi> 1670, his house was again fired two Stories high, about twelve of the Clock at Noon, which was discovered by one of his Men-servants, who, as he was going up one pair of Stairs to attend some Guests, heard a very great noise, cracking and bouncing like Squibs, but much louder, which caused him to run down stairs, crying out, <hi>Master, Master, the house is on Fire,</hi> whereupon search was made, and the fire found out two pair of Stairs in an inclosed Bed, (commonly called a Press-Bed) which was broke out into a perfect Flame, the Rails thereof, with the Deal-boards that inclosed it all round, being on fire, and almost consumed, together with the Bed-cloaths, all save the upper Rugg. This Bed this Examinate saith, must of necessity be set on fire by some Fire-ball, or such like stuff, conveyed into the Bed, (or cast on some combustible matter about it) at a hole about an Inch and half wide, which was made in a Deal-board, instead of a Staple to receive the shutter or bolt of the Lock.</p>
               <p>Had not the fire been seasonably discovered, it would have consumed the whole house, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably many more. But by such timely detection thereof, it was suppressed without doing any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hurt, unless to the Goods in the Room adjoyning, and what else was near it.</p>
               <p>As to the Persons that are violently presumed to be the Authors hereof, this Examinate saith, That on the said <hi>Thursday</hi> at Noon, two Persons came to his house and Dined above stairs, and by their long continuance there, gave some suspition; but nothing appearing till they were gone, caused less notice; yet in less than a quarter of an hour after broke forth the Fire, as aforesaid, just upon the discovery of the breaking forth of which, these two men, one in Black cloaths, the other in Gray, well apparelled, having his Hair of a bright brown colour, with a Shash tyed about him, were seen as they went, to make a stop near by the Examinates House, smiling one upon the other, and pointing at the Fire, which was observed by a near Neighbour, who was condoling the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aster, and making some compassionate reflections on the Neighbourhood, who were like to share in the same affliction; at which these two men deridingly said, <hi>It was either a Casualty, or set on Fire by the Fanaticks,</hi> and so departed.</p>
               <p>Now, that these two persons or one of them, were the immediate Instruments of this Villany, is more than probable by divers circumstances, as well as in the opinion of this Examinate and his Neighbours, who took some small observation of them the latter time; For when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, they made no stay to change their Money (as is usual) but had Money ready for what they had to pay.</p>
               <p>And the description of the habit, stature, and complexion, &amp;c. which the Neighbours gave of these persons, doth exactly agree with the Characters that this Examinate and his Servants describe them by.</p>
               <p>But that they were not apprehended or pursued at that Instant, must be attributed to the deep surprize the people of the House and Neighbourhood were in, every one striving to make provision to secure his own Concern, and partly perhaps to the small Encouragement and little notice then taken by some in Office of such services; it being less dangerous, as things were sometimes man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, to be a <hi>Traytor</hi> and a Villain, than to detect or <hi>discover</hi> one.</p>

               <p>THat he the said <hi>Joseph Speed</hi> being sent on the <hi>Saturday</hi> before about eight of the clock at night, by his Master to carry some goods into <hi>Wapping,</hi> in his return homewards in new <hi>Gravel Lane</hi> was overtaken by two proper men in Gentile Habit, the <hi>one</hi> of them in a Light coloured periwigg and a stuff suit, black and gray mixed, as near as could be gliessed, by the help of a Link that a person passed by withall, it being then grown late in the Evening, and a Rapier by his side; The <hi>other</hi> in a Cloath coat, his own hair and a stick in his hand; Who began to discourse with the Deponent, and after diverse discourses of the deadness of Trade and difficulty of getting money, when they were come into an obscure lonesome place, being a field commonly known by the name of King <hi>Davids</hi> Fort, he in the Wigg began to declare himself more fully, telling the Deponent that there was a way of late come up of geting of money with a great deal of ease. He having some suspicious of them, by their frequent swearing, to found the depth of their intentions, seemed very inquisitive to know what way that was, and how glad and ready he would be to embrace it: whereupon at last the said person in the Wig told him it was to be done <hi>by making of fire</hi>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balls and firing <hi>them;</hi> At which the Deponent, though much surprized, yet concealed his resentments, and pretended to comply with them, discoursing after such a manner as might give them reason to suppose him fit for their pupose. After several words passed, he in the Wig tells him he shall be imployed. Then the Deponent desired to know when and how. Whereupon the same person took two fire-balls (as he called them) out of his pocket, shews them to him, and tells him he should have Twenty shillings to take those Balls, and Fire them in such places as they should direct; the which he expressed as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>viz.</hi> In the great ship that was building in such a yard, being wholly or near finished, and newly Tarr'd on the outside: (which Ship was afterwards understood to be Captain <hi>Tailors,</hi> though the owner was not mentioned by them; and whose Bolt-spit lay cross the street, at <hi>Wapping)</hi> But if it might not conveniently be done there, then to do it at the house adjoyning to the Yard: or if too severe a guard were kept thereabouts then at a Tarr-shop, near the <hi>Armitage Bridge,</hi> or else at the <hi>Talbot</hi> Inn in <hi>Southwarks,</hi> where he said, the Deponent might come easily to the house, the back way, and no body observe him. But he principally urged the firing of the said Ship; and as for the time he bid him observe the Tide, and be sure to do it within an hour of low water. He also gave him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections touching the manner of firing the said Balls, <hi>viz.</hi> That if he could by any means privately get into the said ship, or any of the said houses, then to wrap one of the Balls in half a pound of pitch, with some quantity of Tow, and set fire to it. But if that might not be done with safety and secresy, then to observe a hole or narrow passage which was in the middle or Centre of the Ball, into which he should put some dust of gun-powder, and setting fire to it, throw it into the place intended. After these directions the same fellow gave the Deponent one of the said Balls into his hand, who then was urgent for his money, but is denyed till the Ship or one of the houses should be on fire, They telling him that they would be thereabouts, and when they had observed his work to be done, would go to the <hi>Bull-head</hi> Tavern in <hi>Grace-Church-street,</hi> where they would meet with him and give him his reward. In this discourse about the money the Deponent told them that Twenty shillings was too small a matter, and they might well give him four or five pounds, because he ventured his life, being sure to be hanged if discovered: to which was returned by them, that they would certainly procure him a pardon, if it should happen so, but of that there was no danger. After all this talk the Deponent willing to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them, tells them he was very dry, and desires that they would give him some drink: to which they would by no means assent: But he was so importunate with them as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got a suspicion in them of his design upon them, whereupon he with the Stick said, <hi>Hang</hi>

                  <hi>him Dog,</hi> or <hi>Hang him Rogue, he will not do the business,</hi> or words to that effect; and after some other words, endeavoured to seize the Deponent, one of them drawing his Sword, but he got away, and they did not pursue him, but run away themselves cross the fields as fast as possibly they could, as he turning back at some distance observ'd. They being thus fled the Deponent at once apprehending the hazard of Concealment, and the danger those places might be in that they directed him to fire, did immediately repair to Captain <hi>Tailors</hi> house, as also to the Tarr-shop by the <hi>Armitage</hi> Bridge, acquainting them with this affair, as also several people in <hi>Wapping</hi> as he went along, particularly two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stables and their Watch; thence he went home to his Master, and presently inform'd him of it, who repair'd to the next Constable, they to the Common Council-man of their Liberty, and then all together to the watch-house at <hi>Aldgate,</hi> where part of the Fire-ball was tryed for an experiment, which burned to their general wonder and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The same Night was he to appear before the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor at his house, but his Lordship being in Bed, he was put off till next morning, and then by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his Lordships indisposition, carried before the worshipful Sir <hi>Thomas Bludworth,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom he deposed the premises, and further declared on his oath, that the before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned persons told him, when the Fire came to the midst of the Ball, it would flame two yards or two yards and an half high.</p>

                  <hi>A Relation of a Fire that happened in</hi> Budge-row, <hi>in</hi> July, 1670.</head>
               <p>ON the eighth of <hi>July</hi> about midnight, in a new house, not glazed, in <hi>Budge-row,</hi> a Fire began; the Shop-windows and doors were all made and close shut and fastned when the Brick-layers went away, which was between six and seven of the Clock in the evening before; (the Carpenters not having been at work that afternoon) and the Bricklayers at that time having nothing to do above stairs, but only to build up a wall in the yard. When the fire was first discovered, it appeared in a Room over the front of the Shop, right against the Chimney, where stood several Deal-boards and Laths reared against the wall, being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in order to floor part of the said house, then unfinished; some of the next neighbours who heard the first alarm of the Fire, do affirm, That if they could presently have got to it, they might easily have quenched it, 'twas so small to appearance, or that they could, in case
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48134:17"/>
they had wanted water, have thrown it out at the Window. But before they could get the doors open, it was grown so outragious, that there was no venturing up stairs to suppress it, and in short time it so far prevailed, as very considerably to prejudice four Houses: That this came by Treachery there is good reason to believe; as well because there had been no fire, nay not so much as any person all the day before in the said Chamber where it began, as also for that near <hi>Islington,</hi> on the evening before, some persons that were going thither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, met two men and one woman, who very earnestly inquired, <hi>If there were not a Fire in</hi> London <hi>near</hi> Cheap-side.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THis Informant saith, That he liveth in <hi>Angel-alley</hi> in <hi>Aldersgate-street,</hi> and hath no Family but himself, and two young-men and a maid at home at this time (his wife being at or near <hi>Hampstead</hi> with his said young Child) and that his young men lie at his Shop at a distance from his house; that the next night save one before the fire happened, she call'd him out of his Bed, saying, either the house was on fire, or there were thieves in it, neither of which being found true, caused him to have some Jealousies she in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended some mischief, and therefore last night after she was gone to Bed, sent for her Candle down, and caus'd search to be made over and under all the Beds to see all safe from Fire; that this morning between six and seven of the Clock when he went forth to his Shop, he did not perceive or smell any fire, and left no body in the house but his said servant maid, and that about eight or nine of the Clock his neighbours came to call him, saying, his house was on fire, so he went home, and up stairs, and found it all on fire, two Beds, Curtains and Vallins, and some of the Chamber floor under the Bed burnt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joseph Ashby</hi> saith, That he living over against the said Mr. <hi>Trigg,</hi> perceived much smoak to come out of his house this morning, and then saw the said maid go up stairs and down again, through the window; but never heard her cry fire till Mr. <hi>Shirley</hi> went up to her room where the said fire was, and that he saw the Window Curtains of that room close shut, and that about six of the Clock the same were open.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William Sherley,</hi> and <hi>Matthew Crockford</hi> in effect depose the same.</p>
               <p>Nor could <hi>Mary Torberfeild</hi> the maid-servant herself on her Examination alledge any thing material, but only denyed that she either went up stairs after the rose in the morning, or that she did open the Window-Curtains, both which were positively proved to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary as aforesaid, so that there was a most violent presumption that she set it on Fire, and accordingly she was committed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> but for want of positive Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses that saw her do it, discharged and Bailed out by some of her Confederates as 'tis credibly related.</p>
               <p>It is observable that this Fire was most mischievously designed, as being in a place where no Engine could come, the passages through the Entries are so narrow, and that within five or six yards where it began, there lay two or three thousand Bavins belonging to a Baker: but the providence of God timely prevented, otherwise it had doubtless seized both the Alleys, and then quickly would have reached <hi>Juin-street:</hi> But being thus discovered before it had got head, it was suppressed, doing no further damage than to that room where it began.</p>

               <p>ABout the latter end of <hi>June,</hi> in the <hi>Savoy,</hi> near One a Clock in the morning, a Fire happened in a back room that had been a Strong-Water-shop, where it was first discovered, which immediately went on from house to house, Eastward and West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, till there were Burnt and Blown up fourteen Dwelling-Houses in four or five hours time. There is Treachery believed to have been in the bottom, as occasioning this damage: For it is credibly reported, That Sr. <hi>Jeremy Whithcot</hi> upon his examining the premises had two Watermen brought before him, who did affirm, that they carried two persons appearing as Gentlemen, over-night, to <hi>Westminster,</hi> who were speaking of the heat of the Evening, and one replyed to the other, in the said Water-mans hearing, That it would be an hotter morning at the <hi>Savoy.</hi> Timely care with the help of Engines and blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of houses <hi>Eastwards;</hi> was a prevention of its going further into the <hi>Strand</hi> and towards <hi>Worcester</hi> house. Westwards there was a great Brick Wall, which gave such a Check to it, that by Gods good providence, and the industry of those that came in to help, it was stopt, but two persons were killed outright and six or seven hurt.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE Watch belonging to that Ward, gave in upon Oath before the Coroner and his Inquest, that the said Mr. <hi>Nowers</hi> was in his own Balcony at Twelve a clock that night, and that he talkt to them in as sober and compos'd a frame as ever they saw him in their lives, and about one of the clock it appears his house was on Fire; being first discovered by some passengers going that way, who gave notice to the Neighbour-hood. There were in this house, the Master and his Brother, a Nurse and two young Children, a maid-servant, and an Apprentice: At the time when this fire began the Maid was in the Kitchin under ground, all the rest of the Family being in bed; but the said maid understood nothing of it till it was noised in the street; upon which she ran up stairs to her Masters room, which she found all on a light Fire. By this time her Masters Brother (who lay a story higher) hearing a sudden shriek, awaked, and in his shirt ran down to his Brothers Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but found the door on fire, and with the strength of the smoak was forced back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain having much ado to save himself; yet remembring the Apprentice that lodged on the same story, forthwith awaked him, and they ran together out at the Gutter-window and so broke their way into the <hi>Dolphin</hi> Tavern near adjoyning.</p>
               <p>How this Fire happened is very uncertain; though it is suggested that it might come by a careless Nurse that lay on the same floor with the Masters Chamber and used to have a Candle burning all Night, having in her charge a child of about Thirteen weeks old: But whether it happened so or not, the fatal Consequence was very sad, for it did destroy the Master of the house and a child in Bed with him; and the said Nurse and child with her; yet through the timely help of Neighbours it did not much further harm than destroying the said house, with the upper parts of two houses adjoyning.</p>
               <p>Nor were great and unusual Fires less frequent in these times in the Country; of which I shall mention only two amongst many.</p>
               <p>The first at <hi>Northampton,</hi> where on Munday the Twentieth of <hi>September,</hi> 1675. a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Fire began in the afternoon, and in few hours space burnt down most part of the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48134:18"/>
High street, the Market place (which was a very goodly one) the Stately Church of St. <hi>Allhallows</hi> and two other parish Churches, and above three parts in four of the whole Town. Which being known to be a Corporation of great Trade and generally sharp ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Popery, it may probably be supposed there might be something of design in it, but I shall not urge that, because 'tis the general opinion it came by accident.</p>
               <p>Another great Loss by Fire was at <hi>Cottenham</hi> near <hi>Cambridge</hi> happening on <hi>Saturday</hi> the Twenty ninth of <hi>April,</hi> 1676. about ten of the clock in the forenoon, when a great part of the inhabitants, especially the men, were gone to <hi>Cambridge</hi> Market, or otherwise imployed abroad: It began in an house almost at the Entrance of the Town, at a place called <hi>Green-End,</hi> and the next house to it remaining untoucht, the people were in hopes it would have ended there, but on a sudden, another house being the third from it, was on fire, and from thence (the second still remaining without harm) the Flames were dispersed almost all over the Town, furiously raging on both sides of the street, and burnt down the whole Street as far as the Church before three of the clock in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon. Which is in distance of ground near three Quarters of a Mile, there being about one hundred dwelling houses, besides Barns, out-houses, Corn, Hay, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> consumed in that short time.</p>
               <p>I the rather mention these fires in the Country, though generally they pass unregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as common accidents; because as I well know the design of the <hi>Jesuits &amp;c.</hi> was, that their Instruments should do all the mischief in this kind, whereever they came, either in City or Country, so 'tis well known that about this very time, I mean in 1675. or 76. there were two idle extravagant persons formerly about St. <hi>Martins Le grand,</hi> one named <hi>Robert Norris,</hi> the other, <hi>Finch,</hi> whose ill course of life to the great trouble of their friends had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them to a condition fit to become the Agents of any villany. These two came on foot into an Inn at <hi>Hodgsdon</hi> in <hi>Hartfordshire,</hi> and having lodged a while there, took an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and with a light burning Fire-brand, purposely carried out of the house through the yard down into the Stables, set a parcel of straw on Fire; but being observed by a young Maid who acquainted the Master of the house therewith, he that did it was taken in the very act; the straw flaming and the Fire-brand lying in it; but being seen so soon was quickly extinguished without much hurt done. One of these Companions hereupon run away and made his escape, the other being apprehended confest he put the Fire-brand there on purpose to burn down the Inn and Town if he could do it, and that they came down for that very end, being hired to burn that and some other places, and were to have such a sum (5. <hi>l.</hi> as I remember) for each Town they could Fire; Hereupon he was committed to <hi>Hartford Gaol.</hi> But in his Tryal I know not how things were so ordered that though the fire was actually begun in the Straw as aforesaid, yet it was lookt upon only as an Intention, and consequently not a Felony, but only a misdemeanour, for which he was ordered to stand in the Pillory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Town still their work went forward with all the insolence imaginable; for about the year, 1676. one Mr. <hi>Keeling</hi> a Smith, a very ingenious workman in <hi>Black fryars,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made an Engine most effectual for quenching of Fires, being so contrived that it might be carried into any room, and the pipes of it and consequently the water conveyed by Ladders or up Stairs into any place where Fire may be, The excellency and great use of which Engine was notably Experimented at the Fire in <hi>Southwark,</hi> the <hi>Hospital</hi> there being chiefly by means thereof preserved; For which he was shortly after upbraided and affronted by a certain person, said to be a <hi>Frenchman;</hi> telling him plainly that he <hi>deserved to have his house burnt for making such an Engine;</hi> and several other threatning words: nor did they fail to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it: For within few days after such Menaces, there was one evening a hard ball thrown out of the street through a Glass window breaking a pane as it passed into a Chamber of his said house one pair of stairs high, which as providence would have it, fell into the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the room where there was nothing near apt to take Fire, but only the boards; into which it burnt a round hole of considerable depth, but did no further harm, whether by reason the matter of the Fire-b. was not rightly prepared, or what other accident not known. The whole Room was filled with smoak and stench of burning when the people came into it, which much affrighted them, especially when they found this Ball which was then almost cold, and saw how it had burnt the boards, and which way it came in, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other but that their house was resolved upon to be burnt.</p>
               <p>In the Winter 1677. at the sign of the Shipin <hi>Shadwell,</hi> the house of one <hi>Peirce</hi> a Victuallerthere, there was a Fire-ball placed ready to be fired under a shed, found and discovered accidentally

fore the intended mischief was performed, by some of the Watch, it was of the bigness of a large Orange, very black in colour, and smelt strong of Brimstone, they that found it brought it to <hi>Shadwell</hi> Watch, and divided it to several parts, some to <hi>Wapping,</hi> and <hi>White-Chapel,</hi> some to <hi>Rosemary-lane</hi> Watch, to try Experiments for all their satisfaction. From whence Mr. <hi>Samuel Maurice</hi> had a small part no bigger than a Cherry-stone, and fired it at the house of <hi>Thomas Horn</hi> the Beadle in <hi>Rosemary-lane,</hi> where that little quantity flamed up at least three foot high, and then the flame suddenly ceasing, the Coal left burnt down into an hard Walnut-tree-plank a quarter of an inch deep; This was done in the presence of <hi>Samuel Maurice, Thomas Horn,</hi> and many others in the said <hi>Horns</hi> house, where the hole is yet to be seen.</p>
               <p>The Temple (as we told you before) was a place these Incendiaries had particularly in their Eye, whether it were to revenge themselves in some measure on the Lawyers, many worthy Members of that Honourable profession having from time to time, in our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, been the most active Patriots to preserve the Protestant Religion, and prevent the fly invasions of Popery, <hi>Law</hi> being the best humane out-guard to <hi>Religion;</hi> or whether (as I rather judge because they have told me so) that they thereby aimed to destroy what Writings and <hi>Records</hi> they could, some of which relating to their Conviction of <hi>Recusancy</hi> have (as I have heard some boast,) been prevailed with for valuable considerations to have been kept there, and never returned to the proper <hi>Offices,</hi> whence effectual prosecution and levies might have been made on Popish Estates. But for whatsoever particular intent, or perhaps only for the general design of doing mischief; or whether they were (as some would have them thought) unconcerned therein, this is too certain, there have happened two grievous and lamentable Fires in the Temple of late.</p>
               <p>The first on the <hi>28th.</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> 1677. at the Kings Bench Office, which thereby was burnt down with divers good Chambers and about a dozen dwelling-houses in <hi>White-Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars;</hi> the beginning of this was generally charged on one Mr. <hi>Carpentar,</hi> who was reported to have gone to Bed in drink, but possibly it might be by some other means: However this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, if he were the unhappy occasion, he suffered severely for it, being burnt there, and seven or eight persons killed by the fall of a Wall.</p>
               <p>The next was yet more great and calamitous, beginning at one Mr. <hi>Thornberies</hi> Chamber (a Gentleman known to be a very sober worthy person) on <hi>Sunday</hi> the <hi>26th.</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> 1679. about eleven of the Clock in the Night, the vast desolation hereby caused is yet sadly visible by te hruines, and by the circumstances it is most apparent that the same was Fired by design.</p>
               <p>After this an Attempt was made on an Inn in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> where a <hi>French-man</hi> came in the evening, set fire to the stables and ran away, but going into <hi>Thamestreet</hi> was apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and for the present committed, but afterwards for want of a through prosecution got away.</p>
               <p>On the ninth of <hi>April</hi> one <hi>Elizabeth Oxley</hi> having dwelt about six weeks as a servant-maid with one Mr. <hi>Bird</hi> an eminent Attorney in <hi>Fetter-lane,</hi> took the opportunity when all the Family was in bed, to Fire a large Press in his Closet, in which were kept papers and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and when she thought fit, acquainted her Master that the house was on fire; and running down let in the Watch: but it being observed that she had packt up her cloaths, and several other suspicious circumstances, she was charged with setting the same on fire, and at last con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed the same, declaring on her examination, that she was imployed to do it by one Mr. <hi>Stubbs,</hi> who promised her five pound to do it. Hereupon Mr. <hi>Stubbs</hi> was seized, and acknowledged that he had perswaded her thereunto, and was to give her five Guinneys, besides a Crown in hand. And further said, That one Father <hi>Gifford</hi> (the same man that I my self was to be an Assistant to for such wicked purposes as aforesaid) his Confessor had put him on this business, and told him it was no sin to Fire all the houses of Hereticks, and that the said <hi>Gifford</hi> had promised him one hundred pounds for the same, and told him he was to have the money from the Church. And further declared that he used to meet the said <hi>Gifford,</hi> and other two persons, in St. <hi>James</hi>'s fields, in the dark of the evening to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult these matters.</p>
               <p>They likewise declared several other things concerning an Insurrection at home by Papists, and an Invasion speedily to be made by the <hi>French, &amp;c.</hi> upon which inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48134:19"/>
Confessions, the House of Commons became suitors to his Majesty to grant them both his gracious Pardon, which was granted, and lately allowed in Court.</p>
               <p>The last Intrigue of this kind I shall mention is that of <hi>Daniel Clark,</hi> an Apprentice to a Gentle-woman that kept a Flax-shop in the <hi>Minories,</hi> who on the fifteenth of <hi>May</hi> last set fire to his Mistresses house by putting a Candle to a bundle of Flax, but being seen to do it, the same was seasonably extinguisht without much damage, and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>Newgate,</hi> declaring on his examination, that he was hired to do it by an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Papist; on the fifth of <hi>June</hi> he was Indicted at the <hi>Old Baily</hi> and thereunto plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Guilty:</hi> And though it appeared he had been much tampered with, yet at last the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable pains of the Court got the whole Truth (as I am credibly informed) out of him, and in pity to his youth reprieved him.</p>
               <p>After these numerous Instances I think no ingenuous, impartial man can questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that this cursed design of treacherous Burning has long time been, and to this day is vigorously carried on by the Jesuites and other Papists and their Instruments. Also that no wise man or good subject will be wanting in caution to prevent the future designs of these Incendiaries, or in contributing all he can to bring any of them that shall be discovered and apprehended to condign and exemplary punishment. Which God grant, and ever preserve his Majesty, the Protestant Religion, and this Honourable City.</p>
