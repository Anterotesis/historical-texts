            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THat there are <hi>Obscurities</hi> and <hi>Difficulties</hi> in
Holy Writ is acknowledged by all persons that
are conversant in this Sacred Volume. And
truly, if we consider things aright, we shall find that
this is not unworthy either of <hi>God</hi> or of his <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Word.</hi> Not of <hi>God himself</hi> who endited the
Sacred Scriptures, for he hath most Wisely ordered
that there should be some things Obscure and Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in them, to create a becoming Reverence, and
to let us know that these Writings are not penned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
an ordinary manner. These Clouds and Darkness
are suitable to the Majesty of Heaven, they are
proper to beget in us Humility, and Mean Thoughts
of our selves, to convince us of the Shallowness of
our intellects, to shew us how Short-sighted we are,
to give check to our Presumption, to quash our tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Conceits of our knowledge, to supersede our
Vain Boasting, to repel our Vaunting Pride and
Insolence. They are serviceable also to rebuke our
Sloth and Negligence, to provoke our Care and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and to excite our utmost Diligence. Thus it
hath pleased God to exercise the <hi>Understandings</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:99329:3"/>
men, and to make trial of their <hi>Industry</hi> by these
Difficult passages which occurre in Scripture. If
all places were easy, this Book would be liable to
Contempt, and there would be no room left for our
Diligent Search and Enquiry. But now at every
reading of it we still find something to employ our
understandings <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

busied, here is enough to entertain our
greatest leisure and most earnest study. Here are
many Mysteries to be unfolded, many Depths to be
fathomed, many Abstrusities (both in the things and
in the words that convey the notice of them to our
minds) to be discovered: so that to the Greatest
Student and most Ambitious Enquirer, that will hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen

<hi>When a man hath done, then he beginneth.</hi>
Here are not only Foords and Shallows which we
may easily wade through, but here are unpassable
Depths and Abysses. It hath seemed good to the
Wise Governor of the world that there should be
in the Holy Scripture <hi>Some things hard to be un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

these Sacred Writings might appear, that by this

are: far those places which are plain and clear are
fitted to ordinary capacities, and those other por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

            <p>And as this Obscurity of some parts of Scripture is
not unworthy of <hi>God himself,</hi> so neither is it any
disparagement to his <hi>Sacred Word.</hi> For we must
know that this Difficulty happens from the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the things themselves which are here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded.
It cannot be otherwise but that some por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Scripture must be dark and obscure, and
consequently must labour under Different and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Expositions, because they were written so long
ago, and contain in them so many <hi>Old Customs</hi>
and <hi>Usages,</hi> so many <hi>Relations concerning Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
People,</hi> so many and various <hi>Idioms of

of the Matter, the Ambiguity and Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Significations of the Words, the Inadvertency
of Expositors, and sometimes their unskilfulness,
and oftentimes their Willful Designing to pervert
the words, in order to the maintaining some opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
<pb facs="tcp:99329:4"/>
or practises which they adhere to. But no
man of a sedate mind and reason can think that
the Scriptures themselves are disparaged by these
Difficulties and Mistakes, for they are not arguments
of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> Imperfection, but of <hi>Man's.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
these Obscurities which are accompanied with
the various ways of rendring some Expressions, and
determining the Sense, are no proof of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
of this Holy Book, because in matters
of Faith and Manners, which are the Main things
we are concerned in, and for which the Bible was
chiefly writ, these Writings are plain and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible.
All Necessary and Fundamental Points
of Religion are set down here in such expressions
as are suitable to the capacities of the most simple
and vulgar. God hath graciously condescended to
the infirmities of the meanest and most unlearned,
by speaking to them in these Writings after the
manner of Men, and by propounding the greatest
Mysteries in a Familiar stile and way. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
so far as it relates to our belief and Practice,
is very easie and plain, yea much plainer then the
Glosses and Comments upon it oftentimes are. In a
word, most of the places of Scripture call not for
an Interpreter, but a Practiser, As for other passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
which are Obscure and Intricate (but which
are very few in respect of those that are plain,)
they were designed (as hath been already suggested)
to employ our more inquisitive and elaborate thoughts,
and to whet our industry in the studying of this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:99329:5"/>
Volume; that at last, when we have the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of retrieving the lost sense of the words, and
restoring them to their genuine meaning, we may the
more prize our acquest which hath cost us some pains.
Or, if after all our attempts we cannot reach the true
meaning, we have reason to entertain reverend
thoughts of those Difficult Texts of Scripture, and
to perswade ourselves that they are worthy of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Enditer, though our weak minds cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
them. If Humane Authors delight to dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
their writings sometimes, and it is accounted no
blemish, surely we may conclude that the Mysteries of
the Sacred and Inspired Stile are rather an inhans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
then a diminution of its Excellency. Shall we
not think it fit to deal as fairly with the <hi>Sacred Code</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s <hi>Socrates</hi> did with <hi>Heraclitus's</hi> writings, that is,
not only pronounce so much as we understand of them
to be Excellent and Admirable, but believe also that
what we do not understand is so too? It is certainly
an undeniable truth, that neither the Wisdom of God
nor the Credit of this Inspired Book are empaired by
any Difficulties we find in it. Therefore when the
men of the Roman perswasion make use of these Hard
places in the Bible to disparage and discredit it, and to
render the Scriptures useless as to the common people,
questionless they take a wrong course: first they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
that these Writings are Obscure, and then they
make them more so by locking them up from the
sight of the people; whereas they should rather expose
them to light, and indeavo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r to remove the obscurity
by expounding them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:99329:5"/>This is that which I have done in this Critical Essay
which I here venture into the world: of which it
may be expected I should give some brief Account;
therefore take it thus, In my first Attempt, <hi>viz.</hi> on
those words, [<hi>He shall be called a Nazarene,</hi>] I
reject (but not without shewing my Reasons) the
most generally received Interpretations, and offer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
namely that by a <hi>Nazarene</hi> is meant <hi>one
of the city Nazareth,</hi> an Inhabitant of that place:
and by the <hi>Prophets</hi> that foretold this, I understand
some Inspired persons who predicted that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
should dwell and converse at <hi>Nazareth:</hi> and this
their Prediction was delivered from one to another
till it came to <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Matthew,</hi> who here sets it down
in writing. Therefore let it not startle the Reader
that I say in my Discourse on these words, <hi>There was
such a Report or Tradition</hi> in this Evangelist's days:
for though this is but a Conjecture, yet it is a very
Probable one, I shewing that the Apostles <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paul</hi> and
<hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Jude</hi> made use of the like <hi>Reports</hi> and <hi>Traditions,</hi>
and inserted them into their Writings. Wherefore
it is not unlikely that the Evangelist here refers
to a Tradition which was at that time concerning
Christ's being a <hi>Nazarene,</hi> i. e. that he should be
one of the city <hi>Nazareth.</hi> But because this is only
Probable, I advance farther, and prove that this was
not only spoken by some <hi>Uncertain</hi> and <hi>Unknown
Prophets,</hi> and so conveyed to the Iews, but that it
was likewise foretold by those very <hi>Prophets</hi> who were
the <hi>Penmen of the Holy Scripture:</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
<pb facs="tcp:99329:6"/>
I proceed to prove that these Writers directly
predicted Christ's being related to the place called
<hi>Nazareth,</hi> and his having his denomination thence,
(for <hi>he was brought up there,</hi> Luke 4. 16. and
therefore it is called <hi>his Country,</hi> 23 v.) and lastly
I make it evident that this was actually fulfilled and
accomplished in the plain and obvious meaning of the
words, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>he was called a Nazarene,</hi> i e. One
of <hi>Nazareth:</hi> he was reproached for being an Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant
of that place, and that not only by the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
but by the very <hi>Jews,</hi> for the <hi>Galilaeans,</hi> of whom
the people of <hi>Nazareth</hi> were a part, were of Pagan
extraction, as the <hi>Samaritans</hi> were: they were both
of them looked upon by the grand body of the <hi>Jews</hi>
as <hi>no Jews</hi> properly, a kind of barbarous people in
comparison of themselves and other inhabitants of
<hi>Judea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In my Exposition of the Second Text, which is this,
<hi>Doth not nature it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elf teach you, that if a man hath
long hair, it is a shame to him?</hi> I take the words
<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> &amp; <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> in the largest extent, <hi>i. e.</hi> I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the former, as it signifies <hi>Custom,</hi> and the <hi>Law
of Natural Reason,</hi> and <hi>the Distinction of the
Sexes;</hi> and the latter, as it denotes both the <hi>Length</hi>
and the <hi>Decking</hi> of the hair, and accordingly I
make it my business first to prove, that if a Man ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
indulgeth an Immoderate Length of hair, or is
sollicitous about the Composing and Adorning of it, he
acts contrary to the <hi>Custom</hi> of the soberest part of
mankind, whether they be <hi>Jews, Egyptians, Arabians,
<pb facs="tcp:99329:6"/>
Grecians, Romans,</hi> &amp;c. (all whose practise in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is
case I have represented from those Authors who treat
of the manners of those people.) If it shall be
objected, that there was a <hi>Different and Contrary
Custom</hi> as to these things, I grant it, and yet this is
no prejudice to what I maintain, for the Apostle
without doubt means the Custom and Vsage of the
better and wiser part of mankind, and not of
the worst. Then, in the next place, I demonstrate
this to be disagreeable to the laws and rules of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
which I explain in several Particulars. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
I shew it to be against the established <hi>Law of
the Sexes,</hi> whereby one of them is distinguished from
the other. So that taking the words in this Latitude,
the meaning of the Apostle in them is this, That a
Christian man should not do things repugnant to any
of these three Rules, <hi>viz.</hi> Laudable Custom, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and the Law which is proper to each Sex; and
that he that wears his hair of an Immoderate
Length, or after the guise of Women, offends against
all these Rules. If any one object against the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of this Exposition, I answer, that I take this
for an allowed Verity, that when we meet with words
in any place of Scripture which have different senses,
and those senses are not inconsistent with one another,
we may lawfully take them all into the meaning of the
Text; and that is it which I do here, and thereby
render the meaning of the words full and entire. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
take the words which way you will, and if you
pitch upon any Particular Sense, I hope I have sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
that which will give light to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:99329:7"/>I here adjoyn something concerning the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
of <hi>Covering</hi> and <hi>Uncovering the head</hi> among
the different People and Nations of the world. The
summ of what I say is, that the <hi>Eastern</hi> people went
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lways with their heads covered, and the <hi>Greeks</hi> were
always <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>covered, but the <hi>Romans</hi> took a middle
way, for they thought they were bound as to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to distnguish between the times of <hi>Worship</hi> and
of <hi>Common Conversation,</hi> and that the behaviour
which was used in the one ought to be different
from that of the other. Accordingly they always co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
their heads in the time of Worshipping: from
whence (as well as from what is recorded of them)
we may gather that their practice was contrary when
they were about their ordinary business, that is, that
they were <hi>Uncovered.</hi> But from the <hi>Jews</hi> cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their heads when they worship'd, we cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
that they did not do so at other times, and the
reason is because they made no distinction at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
one time and the other as to this behaviour. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I desire the Reader (that he may not misinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
me) to distinguish between the <hi>Ancient Romans</hi>
and those that came <hi>after them,</hi> for as to this usage
(as well as to some others) these two exceedingly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
from one another: uea, the <hi>Latter Romans</hi>
were strangely enclined to shift their customs, and
differ'd from Themselves as well as the <hi>Old Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
as I have shew'd. This I thought fit to mention
here, lest any man should mistake me and the Truth
it self. I have added something likewise concerning
<pb facs="tcp:99329:7"/>
the custom of the Other Sex, and there you'l find
that there is no Variation at all: the Women of all
Nations generally cover'd their heads when they were
abroad, and the Apostle is not willing they should lay
aside so Landable and Catholick an usage.</p>
            <p>In my Third Vndertaking, which is an interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of those so much controverted words; <hi>What
shall they do that are baptized for the dead?</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
the various opinions of Authors concerning the
meaning of this place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not that I delight to muster
up whole Armies of Writers, some Antient and some
Modern, some at home, others abroad, but because the
present affair requires it. There being several Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
of these words, it was necessary to acquaint you
with them before I offer'd that which I conceive to be
the true and genuine sense of the Apostle. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
after I have rejected the interpretations of Others
on the place, and have all along given you the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
why I do so, I at last expose my own sentiments
in a plain and easie interpretation, such as every one
may see is the genuine import of the words, <hi>viz.</hi> that
<hi>to be baptized for the dead,</hi> is no other then to be
baptized <hi>because of the dead,</hi> or <hi>for the sake of the
dead,</hi> i. e. of those Holy Martyrs who lay'd down their
lives for Christ and his Blessed Cause. The courage
and bravery which these shew'd at their death did ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
invite great numbers of Infidels, who took
notice of their Christian behaviour, to lay aside
their false and idolatrous religion, and to imbrace the
Faith of Christ, and to desire to be admitted mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb facs="tcp:99329:8"/>
of the Church by Baptism. By reason of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
carriage of those dying Martyrs, there were
Converts daily gained to Christianity: many Iews
and Pagans were stirred up to own the same Holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
which they saw them defend so undauntedly.
This made them eager of being baptized. This I take
to be the plain meaning of their <hi>being baptized for
the dead,</hi> i. e. they were baptized, and became Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
for the sake and on the account of those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased
Saints who they saw attested the truth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
with their bloud. How probable this Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
is, yea how preferable to all others, I hope I
have convinced the Reader in the Discourse it self,
to which I remit him.</p>
            <p>In my Last Effort, where I undertake to shew who
are <hi>the spirits in prison to whom Christ preached,</hi> I
do (as before) enumerate the several Glosses which
have been made upon the words. Some have fetsh'd
the sense of them from Heaven, others from Hell,
and some from a Middle place (as they fancy) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
both: and many others have presented us with
their Conjectures on this Text. But when I have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
the invalidity of them, I proceed to let you see
what Other more true account may be given of the
words. And that is this, Christ by his Spirit in his
Apostles and Ministers preached the Gospel to <hi>Sinners</hi>
(and to whom else should be preach it?) to Vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
and Vnregenerate persons, whether Iews or
Gentiles: and hereby many of them were converted
to the faith, and were saved. This is the plain sense
<pb facs="tcp:99329:8"/>
of this Text, which hath been so differently handled by
Protestants and Papists: and this interpretation (as
I think I have made it evident, but the Reader is to
judg) is conformable to the scope of the Context, sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the Phrase and Language both of the Old and
New Testament, and most agreeable to the Thing it
self which is here represented by the Apostle. For
there could not be a more Easie, and yet a more Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant
expression to set forth <hi>the state of men in their
fins</hi> then This of the <hi>spirits in prison.</hi> Those persons
are, in a Religious and Spiritual way of speaking
(which is the constant stile of the Holy Ghost in the
writings of the Prophets and Apostles) <hi>Prisoners</hi> and
<hi>Bondmen</hi> shut up in a miserable Durance: <hi>they sit
in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound
in affliction and iron,</hi> as the Psalmist describes <hi>Poor
Captives,</hi> Psal. 107. 10. This is a plain and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
Metaphor, and at the very first propounding of
it we are able to apprehend its meaning. Poor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
souls that are under the bondage of sin and
vice, are <hi>spirits in prison,</hi> but the Blessed Iesus
<hi>cometh and preacheth to them</hi> by the Ministry of
his Apostles and servants, and thereby <hi>brings them
out of darkness, and the shadow of death, and
breaks their bonds in Sunder,</hi> as the same Divine
Poet speaks in that place. Certainly then <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Peter</hi>
(who had been a<note n="*" place="margin">Acts chains, 12. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Prisoner</hi> and <hi>bound with</hi> and knew the hardships and misery of
this sort of men) could not have made choice of any
Similitude, could not have used any Expression where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb facs="tcp:99329:9"/>
it was possible to give us a more Compendious Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
a more Lively and Natural Idea of the
Deplorable Condition of Vnconverted Sinners, then
this here doth. Which makes it somewhat strange
that such multitudes of Expositors and Comment ators
have not taken notice of it, but have rather chosen to
give us some farfetched and strained interpretations
of these words.</p>
            <p>This is the short Account which I thought good to
premise before the following Exercitations. In the
whole I hope I have faithfully discharged my task:
this I am sure of, that I have not wilfully made any
false steps. I have been very fair, and have used no
violence upon the words, as it is the too common pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of <hi>Criticks.</hi> They are people that rack their
Fanci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eaze and worry, they torment
and most unmercifully force and drag a Text to their
side. You may observe it, an arrant <hi>Critick</hi> is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate

his work, though in never so light a matter, and push<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

               </gap>tmost extremity. I could mention
several Professors of Critisism who are guilty of this
miscarriage, who make it their business to force their
may. You shall see them set downbefore a Text, and
raise their Batteries against it, and play their Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
and Mortars upon it. If this will not do, they
come with greater force, and make a fresh assault with
stronger Detachments from Poets, Orators, Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
Philosophers &amp;c. and fall on with greater fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb facs="tcp:99329:9"/>
thinking by this means to bring it to a Parly, and
then a Surrender: or rather, by their furious attacks
we may guess they intend no other thing then to take
it by Storm. And truly in this Imaginary Romantick
Adventure they think they have done it, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
themselves they have taken possession of the

               </gap>aging and preying upon the
Bible: I do not like the Bombarding of Scripture, I
approve not of the Storming of a Text, and taking it
by force. It is a very unchristian and unbecoming
employment to extort a sense from any place of Holy
Writ, and by little Critical arts and fetches to bring
over the words to a compliance with us, i. e. to the
meaning which we design. Indeed this (however it
may be represented as a Mighty Work) is easily done
by the aides of a Ready Invention, a Luxuriant Pen,
and a shew of some Reason and Argument, espeoially
if these be back'd with a strong Desire of venting
some New Notion in the world. But then I do not
think that the man believes the thing himself after
all his flippant. Rhetorick and strained Logick: which
methinks should make him very uneasie and much
dissatisfied, for how can one offer that to others to be
believed, which he gives no credit to himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For my

<pb facs="tcp:99329:10"/>
I have done in the Present Vndertaking, otherwise
I should think I had dealt very uncivilly (to say no
worse) with the world. I have offer'd that upon
These Texts which I conceived to be most Credible,
which I found to have the warranty of Reason or
some Good Probability. I am not conscious of any
unhandsome and unjust dealing with the words
which I have made the subject of my Discourses.
I have not set any of the Texts upon the Rack,
I have not put them to the Torture to confess what
they never intended. I have let them speak freely
and unconstrainedly: and then you may expect no
other then Truth and Realities. If Others have
different conceptions concerning these places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
I am not offended in the least. I have offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Reasons of my assertions: let them shew
theirs, and then perhaps there will be no disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
However, my purpose is to be Friendly and
Peaceable, and I desire to treat all Writers with a
due respect and deference, though I cannot comply
with them in every thing that they assert.</p>
            <p>To conclude, let all our Enquiries and Disputes

            <p>I Begin first with this Notable pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
in the Evangelist S<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Matthew,</hi> with
which he closeth his second Chapter, <hi>He
shall be called a Nazarene.</hi> There were
two ways of interpreting this of old:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99329:11"/>
First,<note n="a" place="margin">Adv. Marcion. l. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Tertullian</hi> and<note n="b" place="margin">Demonstr. Evang. l. 7. c. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Ensebius,</hi> and
some other Ancient Fathers thought it
was an allusion to the <hi>Nazarites,</hi> a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
and separate rank of persons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Iews</hi> spoken of in the Old
Testament. And more particularly, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               <hi>Ierom</hi> on the place tells us that<note n="c" place="margin">

               </gap>e is to be interpreted a <hi>Holy
person,</hi> and that it is mentioned through
out all the Writings of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that the <hi>Messias,</hi> our <hi>Lord Christ,</hi>
was to be such, and consequently that
it might well and truly be said that the
<hi>Prophets</hi> foretold concerning him, that
<hi>he should be called a Nazarene, i. e. a Holy
Nazarite.</hi> The second way of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting
these words among the Antients
was this, that they have reference to
those places where Christ is called <hi>Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer,
a Branch,</hi> as in <hi>Isai.</hi> 11. 1. &amp; 60.

the first verse of
the Eleventh chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> and such like place that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99329:12"/>
speak of the <hi>Branch.</hi> These were the
Two Opinions <hi>of old</hi> concerning this
Text, and they have been taken up by
<hi>Modern</hi> Expositors both of the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> and of the Reformed perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
Among these latter are <hi>Grotius</hi>
and <hi>Hammond</hi> (to name no more,) the
first whereof merits that Title which
the Greeks gave <hi>Alexander Aphrodisaeus,</hi>
the Antientest Commentator on <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
viz, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Interpreter,</hi> by
way of Eminency. For certainly no
man hath excell'd him in giving the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall
sense and interpretation of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
For this he is Incomparable, and
speaks more Good Sense in one line then
some others in a dozen long Periods.
The second of these Modern Expositors
is our Countryman, one of the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Divines and Criticks of this last Age,
a person of equal Learning and Piety,
and therefore worthy to be (what he
most Eminently was) a Son, or rather
one of the Fathers of the Church of
<hi>England.</hi> The former of these Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Writers refers <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. to the
word <hi>Nazar seperavit,</hi> whence the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarites</hi>
are stiled, and so Christ (saith he)
was foretold in the Old Testament to be
an Abstinent Mortified person, a <hi>True
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99329:12"/>
Nazarite.</hi> The second refers the word
<hi>Nazarene</hi> to that sacred and venerable
title of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>the Branch</hi> often applied to
the <hi>Messias,</hi> and thinks that our Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist
speaks of this here.</p>
            <p>But I cannot Subscribe to either of
these Excellent Persons in what they
offer concerning the meaning of this
word <hi>Nazarene.</hi> It is my perswasion
that neither of these references were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by the Evangelist, and my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is this, because they are nothing at
all to the purpose. Mark how the
words are brought in, <hi>He came and dwelt
in a city called Nazareth, that it might
be fulfilled which was spoken by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
He shall be called a Nazarene.</hi> Is
it not plain to any common understanding
that <hi>Nazarene</hi> refers to <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and
that Christ should be <hi>called the former</hi>
because <hi>he divelt in the latter?</hi> Certainly
there can be nothing more evident then
this, and therefore it is impertinent here
to talk of his being <hi>Netzer the Branch</hi>
spoken of in the Old Testament, or of
his being a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> which is no where
said of him. Or, if he were a <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi>
in any sense (as <hi>Nazar</hi> may fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nife
a Holy Separate person, as our Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>Lightfoot,</hi> and before him <hi>Beza</hi> and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99329:13"/>
               <hi>Heinsius</hi> have observed on this place)
yet this is nothing to the purpose, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that word hath no reference at all
to the <hi>city Nazareth,</hi> which is he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of. I have therefore sometimes won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
that very Learned men have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
themselves with these impertinent
Notions, and that they could prevail with
themselves to think that either of these
were the true meaning of the place. Can
any man reconcile this to sense that the
places in the Old Testament which fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
of <hi>Christ</hi> as the <hi>Branch,</hi> or as a
<hi>Nazarite,</hi> (if there were any such thing)
were fullfilled in his dwelling in a town
call'd <hi>Nazareth?</hi> Can any man of any
accuracy of reason see the Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the one in the other, or find any
Affinity between these? But now if we
take [<hi>a Nazarene</hi>] for <hi>one of the city
Nazareth, or one that dwelt at Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</hi>
the words are plain and easily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
and any one may see the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
of the Prophecy here spoken of.
This then is that which I offer as my
sentiment concerning this Controverted
Text, <hi>viz.</hi> that neither Christ being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Netzar,</hi> not his being in any sense
a <hi>Nazarite</hi> are so much as to be thought
of in this place, because they are wholly
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99329:13"/>
impertinent and foreign here: but the
true, genuine, and unforc'd meaning of
the place is, that it was foretold of old
by the Prophets that our Saviour <hi>Should
be called a Nazarene,</hi> i. e. <hi>a man of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth,</hi>
and accordingly when <hi>he came and
dwelt in the city called Nazareth,</hi> that
which was thus <hi>spoken by the Prophets was
fulfilled.</hi> Here is no straining of the
words, here is no need of far fetched Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticisms,
but the sense of the Text is facile
and obvious, and he that runs may read
it and understand it.</p>
            <p>But you will ask, where is it fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
that he shall be call'd a <hi>Nazarene,</hi>
i. e. one of <hi>Nazareth?</hi> Here then is
the greatest <hi>Difficulty</hi> (if it may be
called so) to prove that this was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied
concerning Christ Or rather,
there are these two things to be proved
before I can hope to gain the Readers
assent to what I have offered: First I
must make it appear that this was foretold
by the Prophets, <hi>viz.</hi> that Christ <hi>should
be call'd a Nazarene,</hi> i. e. a man of
<hi>Nazareth;</hi> and Secondly I am obliged
to shew that <hi>he actually was called so.</hi>
Both these are very Evident, in so much
that I cannot but wonder again that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positors
have overlooked a thing which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99329:14"/>
is so plain and obvious. First, it was
foretold that our Saviour should bear the
Name of a <hi>Nazarene,</hi> and that first as it
is a <hi>Name referring to a Place,</hi> and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
as it is <hi>a Name of Reproach,</hi> taken
from his inhabiting in such a place.</p>
            <p>First, it was foretold as a Name de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from a Place, as it denoteth our
Saviour to be <hi>one of Nazareth.</hi> But
you will ask, where doth any <hi>Prophet</hi>
say that he shall be an <hi>Inhabitant of
Nazareth?</hi> I answer, This is not the
very thing which the Text asserts: and
the observing of it will lead us to the
right understanding of the words. It
is not said <hi>it was spoken by one particular
Prophet, but by the Prophets:</hi> by whom
may be understood not only those that
were the Penmen of the S. Scripture (of
whom afterwards) but others of a like
Prophetick spirit, who used to foretell
the Coming of the <hi>Messias,</hi> and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
to assign the Place of his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<hi>Abode,</hi> as well as that of his <hi>Birth</hi>
and <hi>Crucifixion.</hi> And therefore though
we find not in the Sacred Writings these
express terms [<hi>He shall be called a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarene,</hi>]
i. e. <hi>he shall be,</hi> and <hi>be called
One of Nazareth,</hi> yet S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Matthew's</hi> words
are true, <hi>that this was spoken by the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99329:14"/>
Prophets,</hi> for it was the General Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
among them, when the <hi>Iews</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of them where the <hi>Messias's habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
should be the greatest part of his
life, that it should be at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> a
Town in <hi>Galilee.</hi> This was a Received
Report among the <hi>Iews,</hi> and passed for
a Prophetick Saying, and thence the
Evangelist makes use of it, and applies
it here very appositely when he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
how <hi>Ioseph being warned of God
turned aside into the parts of Galilee,
and came and dwelt in a city called Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth.</hi>
This, saith he, was <hi>spoken</hi> of
long before by the <hi>Prophets,</hi> by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Men that discoursed of the <hi>Messia</hi>
his Coming, and we have received it
from them. For without doubt they
had many things delivered to them from
the mouths of Prophetick persons, which
were transmitted from age to age. Thus
we find S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Iude</hi> quotes <hi>Enochs Prophecy,</hi>
which he had only by Tradition, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
the Lord cometh with ten thousands
of his Saints,</hi> v. 14. And S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> makes
mention of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Sorcerers <hi>Ian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
and <hi>Iambres, 2 Tim.</hi> 3. 8, whose
Names are not found in <hi>Exodus,</hi> but
were taken out of the Traditions of the
Jews. In like manner our Evangelist
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99329:15"/>
quotes that here which was reported to
have been said by certain <hi>Prophets</hi> of
old, whose Predictions were delivered from
one to another. It is not improbable
that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Matthew</hi> had by Tradition such
a <hi>Prophecy</hi> as in express syllables fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
that our Saviour should <hi>be called a
Nazarene,</hi> i. e. he should have his
Name from <hi>Nazareth,</hi> the place where
he was to dwell, for 'tis very likely that
This, no less then the Place of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
<hi>Bethlehem,</hi> was predicted by some
Inspired and Prophetick men.</p>
            <p>The next thing I am to prove is that
this Prophetick Rumour which prevailed
among the Jews was <hi>actually fulfilled,</hi>
i. e. that our Blessed Master <hi>was called
a Nazarene,</hi> or <hi>one of Nazareth,</hi> as that
Name hath reference to the place of his
Habitation. It cannot escape our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
that it is particularly recorded,
and that sundry times, not only in the
<hi>four Gospels</hi> but in the <hi>Acts of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,</hi>
that Christ <hi>was called Iesus of
Nazareth,</hi> and that this was a Name
given him by all sorts of persons. He
was called so by the <hi>Multitude, Luke</hi> 18.
37, and more Expresly and Emphatically
in <hi>Mat. 21. 11. This</hi> (say they) <hi>is Iesus
the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee:</hi> he
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99329:15"/>
had this Name given him by his <hi>Friends</hi>
and <hi>Followers,</hi> by his <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
as you read in <hi>Luke 24. 19. Iohn</hi>
1. 45. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 22 &amp; 4. 10 &amp; I0.
38. &amp; 26. 9. The same Name was
attributed to him by his professed <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
Mark 14. 67. Iohn 18. 5. Acts</hi> 6.
14. and more especially by <hi>Pilate</hi> his
Judge, who fixed this Title on the
Crosse, <hi>Iesus of Nazareth King of the
Iews, Iohn</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> and as for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Titles set over him, mentioned by
the rest of the Evanglists, they were
but Abbreviatures of this. Observe far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that the <hi>Angels</hi> of heaven called
him by this Name, <hi>Mark</hi> 16<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>6. and so
did the <hi>Devils, Mark 1. 23. Luke</hi> 4. 34.
Lastly, he is thus Named by <hi>Himself,
Acts</hi> 22. 8. where we find that even
from Heaven he was pleased to own this
Title, <hi>I am Iesus of Nazareth,</hi> saith
he to the surious <hi>Sauls</hi> Now, is not this
very remarkable, and much to our present
purpose, that <hi>his being of Nazareth</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
gave the <hi>Denomination</hi> to him?
He hath his Name from no other place,
unless it be from <hi>Galil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, Mat.</hi> 21. 12.
and <hi>Nazareth</hi> was part of that <hi>Galilee,</hi>
so that in a manner it was the Same
Name. He <hi>shall be called a Nazarene,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:99329:16"/>
said the Prophers; and behold, he was
So, In <hi>Nazareth</hi> he was bred up, and
thence he had his <hi>Name:</hi> which you
see is most particularly and signally taken
notice of in the Evangelical Writings:
as it were to tell us that the Prophecy
concerning this Name of Christ was real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fulfilled.</p>
            <p>We have now passed the <hi>Boine,</hi> we
have overcome that Great Difficulty
(for so it was thought by some, and
looked upon as insuperable) <hi>viz.</hi> the
proving that Christ's <hi>being called a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arene</hi>
(i. e. <hi>one of Nazareth</hi>) was in
that very notion and sense both fore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>old
and fulfilled. Let us now proceed to
Vanquish this seeming. Difficulty by O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Arguments. Secondly then, we are
to consider <hi>this Name</hi> as it is <hi>a Name
of Reproach,</hi> and so I shall shew that it
was foretold by the Prophets, even the
very <hi>Prophets</hi> who were <hi>Penmen of the
Old Testament</hi> that our Lord should be
called by this Name, and likewise that
he was so called in way of Reproach.
The first of these is to be proved only
in a <hi>general way</hi> from the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
where it is often declared that
Holy and Righteous persons shall meet
with Reproachfull words from the mouths
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99329:16"/>
of wicked men, that it is their usuall
lot in this world to suffer in their Names
and Reputations, to be scoffed at and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed
by that sort of people, and to
be represented as persons loathed and
forsaken by the Divine <hi>Numen.</hi> More
particularly of our <hi>Saviour</hi> 'tis said that
he shall be a Despised and Contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
person in the eyes of men. <hi>I am
a worm and no man, a reproach of men,
and despised of the People. All they
that see me laugh me to scorn, they shoot
out the lip, they shake the head, &amp;c. Psal.</hi>
22. 6, 7. And again, <hi>For thy sake I
have born reproach, shame hath covered
my face, Psal. 69. 7. The reproaches of
them that reproached thee are fallen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me, v. 9. They that sit in the gate
speak against me, v.</hi> 12. It is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
granted that <hi>David</hi> was a Type
of <hi>Christ,</hi> and what he here saith is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
also of Him whose Representative he
was. This no man who is acquainted
with the Bible, and the genius of it,
will so much as think of denying; yea,
he will acknowledge that that whole 22<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
               <hi>Psalm</hi> is more especially and peculiarly
applicable to our Saviour, and 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that he rehearsed either all or part
of it when he hung on the Crosse. Of this
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99329:17"/>
               <hi>Despised Iesus</hi> speaks that Evangelicall
Prophet, <hi>His visage was marr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed more
then any man, and his form more than
the Sons of men, Isai. 52. 14. He hath
no form nor comelinesse: and when they
Shall see him, there is no beauty that they
should desire him. He is Despised and
rejected of men: they hide as it were
their faces from him: he is despised, and
they esteem him not,</hi> ch. 53. v. 2, 3.
Thus it was plainly foretold that Christ
our Redeemer shold be despised and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached,
and spoken against, in which
<hi>General</hi> Predictions this <hi>Particular</hi> one
is included, <hi>viz.</hi> that he should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
and defamed because of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the Place of his habitation: <hi>he
shall be called a Nazarene,</hi> he shall be
reproached and vilified by reason of his
Education and Abode in that Town. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Prophesies which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
are spoken generally and at large,
yet this is clear and undeniable that if the
Title of <hi>Nazarene</hi> was used by Christ's
Enemies as a mark of their despising
and rejecting him (which I shall make
good anon,) then even this Particular
Name was implied and contained in the
General Prediction concerning him. Or,
take it thus, though these Individuall
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99329:17"/>
words here set down by the Evangelist
[<hi>He shall be called a Nazarene</hi>] are no
where found in the Writings of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
yet the Sense and Meaning of
them are there, which is sufficient: as
in <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 42. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Peter</hi> alledges This
as <hi>testified by all the Prophets,</hi> that <hi>through
Christ's name whosoever believeth in
him shall receive remission of Sins:</hi> and
yet among all the Prophets there is not
one extant that hath these words, which
he here delivereth. He speaks not the
very <hi>words,</hi> but the <hi>sense</hi> of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets:
and so doth S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Matthew</hi> here, he
tells us that <hi>it was spoken of by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
that Christ shall be called a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarene,</hi>
which very words though they
doe not occurre in any Prophetick Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Old Testament, yet the <hi>mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
and <hi>Import</hi> of them is to be found
in those Writings, as I have shewed:
for there we read that Christ, as well
as his Followers, shall be despised and
rejected, defamed and reproached, which
is the true sense and meaning of these
words [<hi>He shall be called a Nazarene.</hi>]
Thus the <hi>written Word</hi> of God attests
that he was to be called by this Name.
But perhaps the Prophesies which were
by <hi>Tradition</hi> spake expresly of this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99329:18"/>
and foresignisied to the Jews
that this individual Title of <hi>Nazarene</hi>
should be made use of, and applied to
the <hi>Messias</hi> when he came into the world;
to which also it is likely S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Matthew</hi> here
refers, as hath been said before.</p>
            <p>The next thing to be proved is that
this Prophecy was actually fulfilled,
And here first <hi>more generally</hi> (taking
this Name for a <hi>Name of Reproach and
Ignominy</hi>) we can prove that it was
fully accomplished in that our Saviour was
actually reproached, miscalled, defamed,
when he was here upon earth. They
traduced his Birth and Parentage; they
derided him for his supposed Fathers
Trade, and perhaps his Own, as if it
were some great blemish, some unpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
crime to be of an Honest Calling.
His Life was accused of Debauchery and
Prophanesse, he was aspersed as a Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
and a Wine-bibber, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
as a wilfull Violatour of the
Sabbath; yea, whatsoever he said or did
was matter of their Obloquy and Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
All ranks of men conspired to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
the Blessed <hi>Iesus.</hi> He was mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at by the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> by their Great
Doctors and Rabbies, men of Beard and
Gravity: he was also shouted at by the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99329:18"/>
Giddy <hi>Multitude,</hi> by the Common Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and baser sort of People. The
<hi>Priests</hi> fiercely cried out against him, and
treated him as ignominiously as they u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to do the <hi>Scape-Goat</hi> when it was
to be packed away into the wildernesse.
The <hi>Laity</hi> indeavoured to surpasse their
Instructers, and doubled their spight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Holy Iesus.</hi> Nay, his own
<hi>Relations</hi> disgraced and abused him,
some of his <hi>Kindred</hi> looked upon him
as no other then a Distracted and Phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
person, and accordingly they came
in hast from <hi>Nazareth</hi> to lay hold on
him, and confine him. He is not only
besides himself, but he is Possessed, if
you'l believe the <hi>Pharisees:</hi> he doth all
his Miracles by Art Magick, by a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy
with the Prince of Devils and
Apostate Spirits. In the Jewish Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
he is impeached of Blasphemy; in
the Civil Court, of Sedition and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
and lastly, when he hung upon the
Crosse, they charged him with Despair and
utter Distrust of God. Thus from his first
entrance into the world till his going out of
it, he was the constant subject of mens
Slanders and Reproaches. This <hi>Prophecy</hi>
therefore in the Text was <hi>in the general</hi>
fulfilled, in that he was thus egregiously
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99329:19"/>
               <hi>reproached</hi> and <hi>traduced.</hi> This Prediction
[<hi>He shall be called a Nazarene</hi>] is made
good, for he was called by all those
Names which signifie <hi>Disgrace</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,</hi>
and This is one of them.</p>
            <p>Besides, it was accomplished <hi>in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
way,</hi> in as much as <hi>Christs Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
and <hi>Followers</hi> were treated after the
same manner: for what was done unto
them is interpreted to be done unto Christ
Himself. This I suppose will not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
and therefore we are only briefly
to recount the ill usage in this kind
which they met with. In the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
History we are informed that the
Apostles and Disciples of <hi>Iesus</hi> were a
despised sort of men, that they were
most unworthily aspersed and vilified,
that they were loaden with all Oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies
and slanders. <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paul</hi> speaking of
himself and his fellow Apostles, acquaints
us, that they <hi>were reviled and defamed,
made as the filth of the world, and the
off-scouring of all things, 1 Cor. 4. 12,
13.</hi> And those that succeeded these First
Worthies of the Church sared no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
It was considently reported by
their Enemies that they worshipped, an
Asses head, whence they had the Name
<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f Asinarii.</hi> It was sayd that they met
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99329:19"/>
together before the Sun rose to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their own infants, and that they
then crammed themselves with their warm
flesh, and glutted themselves with their
reeking bloud: and that when this was
done, these Canibals, these Devourers
of their own kind proceeded to acts of
Filthinesse and Incest; yea, and that at
all other times they lived in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of the most Flagitious sins, the most
Execrable villanies. From the writings
of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> and of those that <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logized</hi>
for the Christians, we are ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
that all manner of Falsities were
invented by the Enemies of Christianity,
and thrown upon the Professors of it.
These poor vile abject Creatures stood
exposed to the shock of their injurious
tongues, and received all the filth which
their Exulcerated minds could vomit forth
upon them. To give you an example
of the Highest Improvement of these
mens Malitious Reviling, they had the
impodence and effrontery to fasten upon
the Christians even the Commission of
those villanies which they acted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
thus when <hi>Nero</hi> had set <hi>Rome</hi>
on fire, he laid the fact upon these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents,
as both <hi>Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Suetonius</hi>
cell us. It came to this at last, that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99329:20"/>
               <hi>the very Name of Christian,</hi> without any
addition whatsoever, was a sufficient <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.</hi>
When they called any man a
<hi>Christian,</hi> it was as much as to say he
was a Criminal of the Highest Nature.
Thus <hi>in generall</hi> the Prophecy here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
by the Evangelist is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished,
the Christians, and in them
Christ himself, were despised and reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
they had all the Names and Marks
of Reproach fastned upon them. Though
they were aggrandized by the most Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Titles given them by God, yet
they were debased and vilified by the
Worst of Apellations conferred upon
them by men. In this large sense
the Prophecy is true, <hi>they were called
Nazarenes;</hi> they, as well as our Lord
himself, the Great and Noble Institutour
of Christianity, were loaded with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelies
and Reproaches.</p>
            <p>But more <hi>particularly,</hi> we are to prove
the Accomplishment of this Prophecy,
by shewing you that this <hi>individual
Name</hi> of <hi>Nazarene,</hi> or <hi>one of Nazareth,</hi>
was used as a Reproachfull Appellative
towards Christ and towards his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
We must know then that though
<hi>Nazareth</hi> be called <hi>a City</hi> in this place
of <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Matthew,</hi> yet all agree that it was
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99329:20"/>
a <hi>Mean</hi> and <hi>Poor one,</hi> and rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
(if we look upon it in it self) to
be called a <hi>Village.</hi> Which is no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usuall
thing in Scripture, where we find
places that have the Name of <hi>Cities</hi> are
also called <hi>Villages,</hi> as in <hi>Ios. 19. 7.
1 Chron.</hi> 4. 32. And in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Small Towns or Villages are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
stiled <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>Mat.</hi>
9. 35. <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 38. Of <hi>Bethlehem</hi>
we may Particularly observe that 'tis

               </gap> a <hi>City,</hi> in <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 4. but
<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> a <hi>Village,</hi> in <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 42. We
meet with the like in other Authors:
So <hi>Bethsura</hi> is called a <hi>City</hi> by<note n="e" place="margin">Antiqu. Iud. l. 12. c. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi>
and in the same place <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a
<hi>Village</hi> or <hi>Town.</hi> Thus <hi>Nazareth,</hi> though
it have the name of a <hi>City,</hi> yet it was
but a <hi>mean Town,</hi> or rather a <hi>Village:</hi>
whence it was said in a Proverbial way,
<hi>Can there any good thing come out of
Nazareth? Iohn</hi> 1. 46. It was, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by this Common Saying, a sorry
Contemptible place, and yielded no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant
of any Note and Worth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
you will reckon Mecanicks and
Poor Tradesmen to be such. A <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarene,
a man of Nazareth,</hi> was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
a Despised person among them.
Hence it may be reasonably inferr'd that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99329:21"/>
those who had a mind to disgrace and
defame our Saviour Christ, used to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach

this reason for it, <hi>viz.</hi> because it is plainly
grounded on Scripture. For we read in

            <p>IN this Chapter the Apostle treats
of these two things, First, of the

to the 17th v. Secondly, of <hi>the

the Grand Order or Constitution which
is appointed by God, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>the head
of every man is Christ, and the head of
the woman is the man, and the head of
Christ is God,</hi> v. 3. That is, Christ as
he is Mediatour is subordinate to God the
Father, and man is next in dignity to
Christ, and the woman to the man.
<hi>Christ Iesus</hi> is the Head to whom the
Man is <hi>immediately</hi> subject, and ought

the Minister of mans Redemption: the
Man is subject to Christ, and the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

he raises This superstructure afterwards,
that a Man ought to <hi>uncover his head,</hi>
and a Woman to <hi>Cover hers</hi> in the

as to this particular. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
that that Divine Order before
mentioned was not strictly observed by
them: for whereas the Woman ought to
be subordinate to the Man as her Head
and Governour, they used a Custom
which was contrary to it. It was This,
the Women among them after the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish

And as for the Other sex, <hi>Every wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>

that which is contrary to Divine Order
and Natural Modesty, for by putting on
her Veil she ought to acknowledge her
Inferiority and Subjection to her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;
but she throwing that aside acts
in opposition to it, and at the same time
she appears in an Immodest guise in the
place of Solemn Worship. It follows

               </gap> the Comely
Adorning of the head, of which I shall
speak anon. And it is added, v. 3.
<hi>She shall put off the rayment of her cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,</hi>
i. e. the Hansome Attire she was
in when she was taken captive, and she
must put on <hi>Mournfull Sordid Apparel
a full month,</hi> as you read in the next
words. All which sheweth that she was
to be kept up in the mans house (who
took her in war) in a Neglectfull, yea
Deformed plight, and that <hi>shaving her
head</hi> was part of that Deformity: and
consequently that this is Uncomely and
Disgracefull, yea Loathsome and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferable
in that Sex. Therefore our
Apostle subjoins, v. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>If the woman be
not covered, let her also be shorn,</hi> i. e.
for her to be without a Veil, without
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99329:26"/>
a Covering on her head, is no less Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemly,
yea Detestable, then if she were
shorn: she may as well be without any
hair at all. <hi>But</hi> (as he goes on in the
same verse) <hi>if it be a shame to be shorn
or shaven</hi> (as most certain it is, seeing
the having of long hair is her Glory,
as you read afterwards) <hi>let her be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</hi>
Thus much for the Woman.
As for the Man, <hi>he ought not to cover his
head, for as much as he is the Image and
glory of God: but the woman is the
glory of the man;</hi> v. 7. Which is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Argument to prove the aforesaid
Order or Constitution, <hi>viz.</hi> that Man is
more <hi>immediately</hi> and properly the Image
of God, the representation of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Excellency, and therefore must be
Uncovered. In comparison of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
he is the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> and that
primarily, but the Woman is but the
<hi>Image and Glory of the Man.</hi> Again,
the Apostle argues from the O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iginal
of Man, v. 8. <hi>For the man is not of
the woman, but the woman of the man,</hi>
i. e. Man hath this Prerogative to be
immediately from God, but the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
was from Man. He argues also
from the End as well as the Origine
of Man, v. 9. <hi>Neither was the man
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99329:26"/>
created for the woman, but the woman
for the man;</hi> as much as to say, the
woman was made to be a <hi>Meet Help,</hi>
to be Administring and Subservient to
Man: consequently she is not <hi>superiour</hi>
to him, but she is to behave her self
Submissively, and therefore to <hi>cover her
head,</hi> which is a sign of that Submission.
The Apostle pleads for this behaviour
as due also in respect of the Angels, v.
10. <hi>For this cause the woman ought to
have power on her head because of the
Angels;</hi> the explication of which I shall
remit to another place. But although
this was the rate of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Pauls</hi> Divinity,
yet in the two next verses he doth a
little moderate his discourse, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie
what he had said in the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
verses, to which this ought to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed.
Because he might seem to have
been somewhat too Harsh to the Women,
he prudently and cautiously mitigates
and tempers his former Argument here,
that it may not redound to the dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
of the Sex. <hi>Nevertheless</hi>
(saith he,) <hi>neither is the man without
the woman, neither the woman without
the man in the Lord. For as the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is of the man, even so is the man
also by the woman: but all things of God,</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:99329:27"/>
v. 11, 12. Having thus salv'd his harsh
doctrine, he proceeds to a new Topick,
namely the Natural Congruity and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
of the thing it self which he had
been urging. And here he appeals to
Themselves, and their Own Judgement
concerning the matter he is speaking of,
and reproving them for, <hi>viz.</hi> Mens
praying with their heads covered, and
Women, with theirs uncovered. <hi>Iudge
in your selves</hi> (faith he:) <hi>Is it comely
that a woman pray unto God uncovered?</hi>
v. 13. It is so Reasonable a thing which
I speak of, and now require of you, that
I submit it to the Natural sentiments
and decision of your own minds. And
here the words of the Text are brought
in, <hi>Doth not Nature it self teach you that
if a man hath long hair, it is a shame
to him? But</hi> (on the contrary, v. 15.)
<hi>if a woman have long hair, it is a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this short Descant on this part of
the Chapter you may perceive the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
and Scope of the words which I
am now to treat of, Concerning <hi>men or
womens wearing their Hair.</hi> Expo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itors
have exceedingly varied in their indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to Joyn these words with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:
many things very much Strained
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99329:27"/>
and Misapplied are said by them; But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a deliberate view of the whole, I take
This to be the True and Natural Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the words; They are brought
in here by the Apostle as a <hi>Reason</hi> of
the Precept he gave them, <hi>viz.</hi> that
Women must be Ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>led or Covered,
and Men Uncovered when they pray.
To perswade and convince them of the
<hi>Reasonableness</hi> of this Command he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals
to <hi>Nature,</hi> and tells them that
<hi>This</hi> teacheth them that very thing which
he enjoyns them: and <hi>This</hi> disalloweth
of that which he forbids them. As if
he had said, your selves may in your own
minds and consciences judge of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
of Mens uncovering their heads
when they pray, and of the contrary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decency
of this practise in Women. I
have shewed you that these are founded
on the Appointment of Heaven, the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of our Universal Governour, the
Principles of Nature, the Law of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and the Distinction which ought
to be between the Sexes. This is no
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nfrequent thing that your duty is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to you even by the dictates of
your Reasonable Nature. Several things
which may be urged upon you are of
this fort, the very Natural Light which
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99329:28"/>
you are indued with, suggests the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of them. As now, because I am
speaking of <hi>Covering</hi> or <hi>Vncovering the
head,</hi> I will instance in a thing which is
nearly related to it, <hi>viz.</hi> the Manner
of wearing the hair of the head, What
is commendable in Men, and what in
Women as to this matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Here the
very Light of Nature shines upon you,
and directs you what to do. If you
will consult your selves, and the Natural
suggestions of your minds, you shall plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discover what is your duty. <hi>Even na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it self teacheth you, that if a man have
long hair, it is a shame to him: but if a
woman have long hair, it is a glory to her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all persons that have Commented
and Treated on these words doe not so
easily agree about the meaning of them:
Yea, there is a very great Disagreement
among them. And the reason is, because
they give different senses of these two
Principal words, [<hi>Nature</hi>] and that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which we translate [<hi>to have long
hair.</hi>] The only Difficulty therefore
lying in these two words, I will enquire
1. What is meant by <hi>Nature.</hi> 2. What
is meant by <hi>having long hair,</hi> or rather
what the Greek word, which is here so
rendred, truly signifies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:99329:28"/>First, let us enquire what is meant
by <hi>Nature. Nature here teacheth</hi> us
something, but we cannot tell what that
is which it <hi>teacheth,</hi> unless we know what
<hi>Nature</hi> is. And in order to that, we
must acquaint our selves how this word
[<hi>Nature</hi>] is taken. It sometimes signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
the Natural and Inbred Corruption
of mankind. Thus we are said to be
<hi>by Nature the Children of wrath,</hi> Eph.
2. 3. i. e. by our Common Degeneracy
and Apostacy in <hi>Adam</hi> we are liable to
the wrath of God. And so generally
in the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical Writers</hi>
the word is taken, it denotes the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Nature of man, the original De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation
of the sons of men. But see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Apostle here speaks of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which is Good and Laudable that
<hi>Nature</hi> teacheth, thence we may infer
that This is not, and cannot be the
meaning of the word in this place. There
are Three other significations of it, and
one or more of them must undeniably
be understood here.</p>
            <p>First, it is taken for the <hi>Law of
Nature in General,</hi> Natural Light or
Knowledge, the Inward dictates of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in a mans breast. Thus the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
<hi>doe by nature the things contain'd
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:99329:29"/>
in the Law,</hi> Rom. 2. 14. i. e. they
have a Rational Principle in them which
prompts them to do those things. <hi>This</hi>
hath its name both in Greek and Latin
from its<note n="b" place="margin">

               <hi>being born</hi> with a man, it is
the Innate and Congenite property of
the Rational soul of man. And because
God is the God of Nature, and it is
He that hath planted in our minds Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of Good and Evil, therefore this
becomes a Divine Law, and is set up in
mens hearts as such. What is dictated
by Right Reason or the Law of Nature
may be said to be dictated by God Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
Therefore S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Chrysostom</hi> on this
place faith, that<note n="c" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>to teach us,</hi> the Apostle doth as good as
say, <hi>God teacheth</hi> for it is He that hath
contrived and framed Nature.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is taken for that <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Law</hi> or Dictate of <hi>Nature which
teacheth a Difference of Sexes:</hi> as in
<hi>Rom. 1. 26, 27. Their women did
change their natural use into that which
is against nature: likewise the men left
the natural use of the women.</hi> Here it
is evident that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> &amp; <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> signifie the Discrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Sex, and what is suitable or
disagreeable to this Discrimination. <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:99329:29"/>
here must needs signifie the <hi>Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Sex,</hi> i. e. the Particular Law of
Nature concerning that Distinction, and
not the Law of Nature in General; for
though other sins, as Fornication and
Adultery, are against the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Reason as well as This, yet
This is against the Law of the Sex, and
the Distinction of man and woman, which
is a Particular and Individual Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and wholly different from those
others. You will also find This to be
the signification of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in
<hi>Lexicons</hi> and <hi>Glossaries</hi> from very Good
Authors, as <hi>Thacydides, Iosephus, Philo,
&amp;c. Salmasius</hi> proves <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to be <hi>Sexus:</hi>
and answerably to this meaning of the
word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> &amp; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
in <hi>Diodorus Siculus, Iosephus</hi>
and others.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> may be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<hi>Castom:</hi> and this unquestionably
is sometimes the meaning of the word in
Good Greek Authors. The Verb <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
is as much as <hi>solet,</hi> and thence the
Verbal Nown <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is derived
thence, signifies <hi>Custom.</hi> But this is
not the proper and genuine signification,
but is only a Derivative sense, because
what is Natural is usual and common;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:99329:30"/>
and again, what we Use our selves to
doth as it were become Natural to us;
thence <hi>Custom</hi> is said to be a <hi>second Nature,</hi>
yea, a<note n="d" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> Long and Inveterate Custom is
stronger then Nature it self. So that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this threefold acception of the
word, there is a threefold Opinion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the meaning of the Text. 1. Some
hold that it is a Law of Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that a man should not have Long
Hair, i. e such hair as women have.
So <hi>Vorstius</hi> and <hi>Poimenander</hi> (two Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick
Divines) understand the words, and
their Countryman <hi>Grotius</hi> is not wholly
averse to it, for he is willing to grant
that it is a Custom founded on Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
dictates. <hi>Doth not Nature it self
teach you, that &amp;c. i. e.</hi> Doth not the
Jnbred and Natural Light in your minds
dictate this to you? 2. Others say the
Text speaks of that Particular Law of
Nature which teacheth there must be a
Difference between Sexes. So <hi>Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
and <hi>Revius</hi> interpret the place. <hi>Doth
not Nature it self teach you, that</hi> &amp;c.
i. e. the Sex, the Difference of Sex,
the Distinction of man and woman
teacheth you this, it being the <hi>Law of
Nature</hi> to put difference between man
and woman as to <hi>Clothes,</hi> and <hi>Wearing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:99329:30"/>
the hair.</hi> 3. Some hold that it is <hi>Custom</hi>
only which teacheth this. Thus <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,
Grotius, Hammond</hi> understand the
words: but it is not well agreed among
them whether it was a Particular or a
General Custom, whether it was a <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom</hi>
among all Nations, or some only.
Thus far we have considered the First
Principal word in the Text.</p>
            <p>The Other word [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] which is
rendred here [<hi>to have long hair</hi>] is
variously taken also: which is the other
reason why this place is so difficult to
be understood. The word [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] is
as much as [<hi>gloriari, superbire</hi>] in
very sufficient Authors; but because it is
evident that That cannot be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
here, I will pass it by. The other
two significations of the word are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
in this place. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> signifies
either barely to <hi>Nourish the hair, and
let it grow at length,</hi> or to <hi>Bind it up
in a neat manner, to dress, trim and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn it.</hi>
These are the two noted sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications
of this Greek word. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
I will consider the Apostles words
1. as they may be meant of <hi>Long Hair:</hi>
2. as they may be understood of Hair
that is <hi>Tied up, Trimmed and Adorned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, taking [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] for [<hi>having
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99329:31"/>
long hair,</hi>] let us enquire in the First
place whether <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>stom</hi> teacheth us that
we ought not to wear such hair; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
let us see whether <hi>Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
teacheth this: and Thirdly, what
the <hi>Distinction of Sexes</hi> dictates in this
case.</p>
            <p>I. If <hi>Custom</hi> be meant by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> here,
let us examine what <hi>Custom</hi> there is
for <hi>Long Hair,</hi> and that first among
the Iews, secondly among the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
First, what was the <hi>Custom</hi> of the <hi>Iews?</hi>
Among them the Divine Law forbad
the Priests to<note n="c" place="margin">Lev. 21. 5.</note> 
               <hi>shave either head or beard.</hi>
But though they were not to do this,
yet they were not to wear their hair
Long, but a middle way was prescribed
them, that is, a Moderate cutting of the
hair, as we read in <hi>Ezek. 44. 20. They
shall not shave their heads, nor suffer
their locks to grow long, they shall only
poll their heads.</hi> Neither Baldness nor
too Long hair were to be used, both
these Extremes were to be shunn'd in
opposition to the <hi>Heathens</hi> (as you shall
hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> afterwards) who sometimes cut off
all their hair, at other times let it grow
Neglected and Long. But a Decency
and Moderation are here enjoyn'd the
<hi>Priests,</hi> and they were to be Examples
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:99329:31"/>
to the <hi>People.</hi> And it is likely the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
did follow this Pattern at first, and
wore their hair of a moderate length,
although in this as well as in other things
they afterwards swerved from the Rule,
and were dispensed with because of the
hardness of their hearts. Thus some of
the <hi>Iewish</hi> people had very long hair,
and the Pictures which we have of them
represent them oftentimes so. But from
the beginning it was not so, for it is
probable that the same Law obliged the
People and Priests, i. e. that they should
neither shave their heads, nor wear their
hair long. But it will be asked, where
is this Prohibition? I answer, one part
of it is expressly set down, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is implied. <hi>All</hi> persons among them
were forbid to shave, or cut close their
hair, <hi>lev. 19. 27. Ye shall not round
the corners of your heads, neither shalt
thou mar the corners of thy beard.</hi> They
are forbid here the Circular Cut of their
hair, i. e. to cut the hair of their heads
or beards after the superstitious manner
of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> who used<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (as several
Learned<note n="f" place="margin">Bonfrerius, Bochart, Groti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, Heinsius.</note> Writers inform us) <hi>to round
the hair</hi> of their heads, that is, to cut
it off all on the sides, and to leave on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Lock behind, or a Tust at top,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:99329:32"/>
which they devoted to some God or
Goddess. This particular way of Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the hair was used in the time of
Mourning for the dead, as I gather from
the next verse, where the <hi>making any
cutting in the flesh for the dead</hi> is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid.
Their Cutting themselves was a
sign of their Excessive Lamentation for
the deceased: and so this <hi>rounding the
corners of the head</hi> (i. e. cutting the
hair off on all sides) being joyned with
it, is to be interpreted (I conceive) of
Immoderate Mourning for the dead, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
as the <hi>Heathens</hi> used to lament
their departed friends. And to confirm
this Interpretation, you will find these
two joyned together again in <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.
1. and in <hi>Ier.</hi> 16. 6. For <hi>otherwise</hi>
you may remember that they made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Bald at Funerals, and they did
not offend in so doing. We read that
this was the practise of the best among
them. And they were invited to it by
the Prophets, or rather by God himself.
<hi>The Lord in that day called for Baldness,
Isa.</hi> 7. 15. and so in <hi>Isai. 22. 12.
Ier. 7. 29. Mic.</hi> 7. 18. They would
not have been call'd upon to Lament
after this manner, if it had been sinful.
So then, this Baldness or Tonsure at
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:99329:32"/>
Funerals and other Sad Occasions was
not unlawfull among the <hi>Iews,</hi> only so
far as it was Superstitious, and in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Idolatrous <hi>Gentiles.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that Law in <hi>Leviticus</hi> chiefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
the Idolatrous Custom of throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Hair into the Sepulchres of
the dead, and devoting them to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
souls, and such like practises a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Pagans.</hi> But now from this
particular <hi>Custom</hi> of cutting off their hair,
or Shaving in case of Great Mourning,
we may gather that at Other times they
did not cut so close, for it is clear that
if they did, they would have left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to cut when the Mourning-Time
came. It is reasonable therefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that they generally wore their hair
of a Moderate Dimension, and as they
cut not close, or in that Spherical way
before spoken of, so they ran not into
the <hi>Other</hi> Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>eam, <hi>viz.</hi> of indulging
Uncut and Long Hair. And <hi>This</hi> is
as evident as the other, for the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of the <hi>Nazarites</hi> is a demonstration
of it. These were a peculiar sort of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votionists
among the <hi>Iews</hi> who suffered
their hair to grow, and wore it Long,
and put it in fillets, or knots and locks,
as the women then did. <hi>Samson</hi> was
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99329:33"/>
such a <hi>Nazarite. A razor shall not come
upon his head, </hi> saith the Angel to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h's</hi>
wife. And God promised him that
as long as he continued a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> and
cut not his Hair, but let it grow; this
should be a token to him of that Strength
which God extraordinarily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> him
with <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>but he broke the Vow of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarism</hi>
and suffered his hair to be cut
off. Some distinguish between <hi>Perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>
and <hi>Temporary Nazarites:</hi> among
the former they reckon this <hi>Samson, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi>
and <hi>John the Baptist, </hi>among the
latter <hi>Absalom</hi> (who cut his hair the
thirtieth day of his Vow,) and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul,</hi>
who had made a Vow not to shave for
a time; but this being expired he cut
his hair after a solemn manner, as
was the Custom, and is expressed in <hi>Acts
18. 18. Having shorn his head in Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrea,
for he had a vow.</hi> (Though it is
thought by some that this refers to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quila</hi>
just before mentioned, and not to
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul.)</hi> And such were the <hi>Nazarites</hi>
spoken of in <hi>Acts 21. 23, 24. </hi>Yea D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
               <hi>Lightfoot</hi> is of opinion that these <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
some of them at least, in a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
humour affected <hi>Nazaritism,</hi>
and that this was the occasion of the
Apostle's reproving them for their Long
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99329:33"/>
Hair. But though it be the received
opinion that there were some <hi>Perpetual,</hi>
and others <hi>Temporary Nazarites,</hi> yet I
am not satisfied about it; I rather think
that they were <hi>All</hi> left to their liberty
to vow as they pleased, and that some
observed the Vow a longer, and others
a shorter time. He that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Num.
6. (which Chapter is wholly spent in
setting down the Law of <hi>Nazarites</hi>)
will be perswaded to think so, especially if
he well weigh the 17, &amp; 18. v. Thence
it will appear that it is a mistake that
some <hi>Nazarites never</hi> cut their hair:
From this place it is clear that none of
them (for This is an Universal Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Nazarites</hi>) nourished their hair
Continually, but that after such a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
time they cut it off, and devoted
it to God. <hi>All Nazarites</hi> might after
a set season dispose of their Hair. But
that which I infer from the premises is
this, that the Law of <hi>Nazaritism</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Long and Uncut Hair (thoug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
but for a time) proves that the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of <hi>Long Hair</hi> was not the common
us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ge of the Jewish people. If it was
peculiar to few, and that by Vow, then
it was not the practise of the general
body of the Nation. The <hi>Nazarites</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:99329:34"/>
abstain'd from cutting their hair: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
others (who were not obliged by
the Law of <hi>Nazaritism</hi>) did cut their
hair, and suffered it not to grow Long.
<hi>Nazarites</hi> by Vow wore Long Hair,
therefore those who were not tied by
that Vow (as the Generallity of the
Jewish people) took up another usage.
<hi>Long Hair</hi> was a thing <hi>Unusual</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary</hi>
in those Religious and Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
persons: therefore it was the <hi>Usual
Custom</hi> not to have long hair. These
I take to be very Rational Inferences.
This was the first thing I undertook,
to acquaint you what was the <hi>Custom</hi>
of the <hi>Iews.</hi> And here there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more to be seen and gathered then
among <hi>Other People</hi> of the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
besides the Law of Nature, they
had the Law of God to direct them in
this as well as in other things.</p>
            <p>In the second place let us see the
practise of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> The <hi>Arabians,</hi>
among whom <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

let their hair grow Long on their

But <hi>Herodotus</hi> in the same place adds
that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> used to shave their

let the hair of their heads grow. And
therefore in the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Hieroglyphicks,

said Author relates that they were so far
from this, that they were all of them
Shaven, But the <hi>Grecians</hi> make the
greatest figure here, and therefore I will
in the next place shew what their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
and Practice was as to the wearing
of their Hair. That these people of
old were used to wear their <hi>hair Long</hi>
we learn from their constant Epithet in
<hi>Homer,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Though it is
certain that at first the <hi>Grecians</hi> were
of another fashion. Short or Moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-grown
hair was thought by them to
be best, and accordingly they used them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to it: the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
were noted for this. But if you
would know how they came to alter
their primitive usage, I am able to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
you by offering. These following
things to your thoughts. 1. It was a
<hi>Philosophick</hi> humour to wear the <hi>hair
long:</hi> which though it began at first
with their Beards, yet afterwards it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
higher, to the hair of their Heads.
The reason was, because Gravity and
Majesty were thought to be in this sort
of Hair. And yet these very men, who
of all others one would think should
not be sickle and inconstant, ran from
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99329:35"/>
one Excess to a contrary one. Hence
it is that in <hi>Aristophanes</hi> sometimes the
<hi>Philosophers</hi> are laughed at as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
at other times for being <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>;
one while they appeared with long
Locks flowing loosly on their shoulders,
another while they were shorn to the
very Skin: and both these Extreams
were the effects of Sordin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ess and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veteousness,
and because they had a mind
to spare Charges. Some of the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers</hi>
wore short hair on their Heads,
but Long Beards. But the <hi>Cynicks</hi> and
<hi>Stoicks</hi> were all shaved close. 2. It may
be the <hi>Poets</hi> had some influence here as
well as the <hi>Philosophers:</hi> They general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
described their <hi>Gods</hi> (excepting <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi>)
with Long hair, and so the Limners
drew <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>em; wherefore it is no wonde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Mortals were induced to imitate
the Gods. 3. They indulged a great
<hi>Length of hair</hi> because they thougt it
<hi>Beautifull.</hi> This is a reason <hi>Eustathius</hi>
gives of the Epithet in <hi>Homer</hi> before
mentioned. It seems the <hi>Greeks</hi> very
much affected Comliness and Beauty, and
they perswaded themselves that these
were augmented by their Dangling Locks;
hereupon they were very solicitous to
nourish them. 4. Another Reason
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:99329:36"/>
(which may be thought to be almost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with the former) was this,
they did it to strike <hi>Terrour</hi> into thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Enemies. Thus particularly of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaemonians,</hi>
               <note n="l" place="margin">Lib. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Herodotus</hi> reports that they
began to wear Long hair and Beards
when they turned Warriors, and he tells
the particular Time, <hi>viz.</hi> when they
began the war against the <hi>Argives.</hi> Nay,
<hi>Xenophon</hi> relates that <hi>Lycurg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Lawgiver and Governor, would
have them wear their hair long and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheveld,
to fright their Enemies. Hence
the forenamed Commentator on <hi>Homer,</hi>
when he gives an account why the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
souldiers tricked up themselves, and
wore Long Hair, saith it was not only
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to make them look Beautifully but
Formidably, to please their own eyes,
and to affright their Enemies, to shew
at once the Lustre and Terrour, the
Bravery and Dreadfulness of War. But
however the <hi>Grecians</hi> thought and acted
in, those ages when they became Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>upted,
yet it is not to be questioned
that the Thoughts and Actions of the
Wisest among them were of a different
kind. The Scholiast on <hi>Aristophanes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites
it as an <hi>Athenian</hi> Law, that<note n="m" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>.</note> the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99329:36"/>
Souldiers must not pamper themselves,
neither wear hair long. And as for That
Pretence of theirs for letting their hair
grow to an exceeding great <hi>Length, viz.</hi>
that they might thereby Affright their
Enemies, it was afterwards found weak
and insufficient, and the <hi>Grecians</hi> thought
good to alter this custom; which was
done upon occasion of the <hi>Abantes,</hi> a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
people, and Skilful in arms, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they used to fight close, cut off the
hair of their heads before, that their
enemies might not take them by it when
they fought. These men let their hair
grow only behind, and therefore are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

speaks, saying, It is a good and lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

as Servants and Slaves were shaved.
Thus you see how <hi>Long Hair</hi> became
Modish among the <hi>Greeks:</hi> they had
one pretence or other to commend this
Fashion. Yet they could not but be
sensible that this was an Upstart usage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and that they varied herein from their
<hi>pristine custom.</hi> It may be from a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
upon this, and to make some
amends, and to expiate as it were for
this their folly, they afterwards brought
up the custom of cutting their hair, and
consecrating the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

frequent in those Writers who give an
account of the Manners and Customs
of the <hi>Greeks</hi> then this, that it was a

hair till they were grown up in years,
and then to poll it, and dedicate it to

               </note> 
               <hi>Achilles</hi> did. Others consecrated

               </note> 
               <hi>Theseus</hi> did.
<hi>Pindar, Aeschilus,</hi> and others give testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
concerning this Consecrating their
hair: which I conceive was an Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
for their former wearing of it so
long. But, alas! after these first-fruits
of their hair (which they call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>)
were thus dedicated by them,
and when they came to mens estate, they
thought they might take liberty for the
future, and indulge the Length of their
locks, as they had done before. But
then at certain times, as if they were
conscious to themselves of their faultiness
in wearing their hair after too Luxurious
a manner, they corrected themselves for
it when they grew more Sober, and had
Occasion to <hi>Mourn</hi> and <hi>Lament.</hi> Then
off went their Shaggy Locks; and their
Bald Pates appeared: they seemed now
by their Baldness to repent of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Folly, and to bewail it by this
Symbal of Grief. But behold again the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ickle humour of these men! They testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd
their Mourning not only by Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:99329:38"/>
but by letting their hair grow
Long. They imitated the contrary Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
of the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Egyptians;</hi> the
former of which shaved close in time of
Mourning, the latter went with Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
hair and Uncut. That the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>
practised this <hi>latter,</hi> is expresly
witnessed by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> who saith that

               </note> if any Calamity happen'd among them,
though the women were shorn, yet the
men cut not their hair all the time.
And as for the <hi>former,</hi> but Contrary
usage,<note n="u" place="margin">Lib. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Herodotus</hi> assures us that in his
days the <hi>Argives</hi> (the Antientest <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>)
expressed their Sorrow and Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
by cutting their hair off, and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their heads. Or, if this be questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
because it is but a single Instance,
the Reader may consult<note n="x" place="margin">De animal. sacr.</note> 
               <hi>Bochart,</hi> who
will supply him with a great many. Now
from these <hi>Contraries</hi> and <hi>Extreams</hi> we
may certainly gather what was the <hi>usual</hi>
and <hi>Ordinary Custom</hi> of the <hi>Greeks</hi> as
to their hair. Their running out into
Excess at those extraordinary times ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints
us that they were Moderate at
other times. Though I must say this,
there was a great Alteration as to this
matter, in respect of the Age; for in
one Age the <hi>Greeks</hi> were more inclined
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:99329:38"/>
to wear <hi>Long Hair</hi> then in another, as
might be proved from their Historians.
It is certain that this was not their fault
<hi>at first;</hi> they then wore their hair Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately,
but by degrees, and for several
pretended reasons (as hath been shewed)
they degenerated into the custom of
<hi>Long Hair.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The practice of the <hi>Romans</hi> is next
to be enquired into. They did some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
as the <hi>Grecians,</hi> express their <hi>Grief</hi>
by cutting off their hair: especially in
time of great <hi>Danger</hi> they did this. In
a storm at sea, when they were affraid
of Shipwrack they shaved their heads, as
appears from that of <hi>Iuvenal,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Tuti stagna sinus gaudent ibi vertice raso,</l>

               </q>
               <hi>Petronius Arbiter</hi> and others confirm
this usage, and perhaps this is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Pauls</hi> words, <hi>Acts</hi> 27. 34.
<hi>There shall not a hair fall from the head
of any of you,</hi> i. e. the tempest at sea
shall not be so great and dangerous that
you shall have occasion to shave your
heads, as the custom is in such cases<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But this is certain, that the <hi>Romans</hi>
were not ignorant that <hi>Hair</hi> was given
by Nature for a Covering and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:99329:39"/>

look'd upon the being Deprived of it

Shaving the head was the

               <hi>Variety</hi> as to this among the Gentiles,

<hi>Criminals</hi> and <hi>Malefactors</hi> had

their <hi>Slaves;</hi> among some of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
Shaving</hi> was a token of Slavery,
but among others of Liberty. Yet
most commonly the former prevailed,

look'd on Hair as a great Decency and
Ornament. But not withstanding this, I
doe not find that the better and more

the length of their hair. I grant that
before they were Civilized, and taught
to govern themselves in some tolerable
manner, they neglected the cutting
of their hair.<note n="b" place="margin">Dere rustic. l. 2.</note>

               </hi> knew any such thing as a
Barber. And some of the Old Statues
of the <hi>Romans</hi> represent them with hair
of a very great Length. But when
knowledge and manners were cultivated,
they lopt their locks. The Pictures of

the body of the <hi>Roman</hi> people, Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
testifies that these (as well as the
<hi>Grecians</hi>) let their children, till they
came to be of years, nourish their hair
to some considerable Length<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then
it was the fashion to offer it to some
of the Deities they most affected. When
this was done, they for the most part
cut their hair as often as it began to
come to an immoderate length, and
would not suffer it to grow to any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant

            <p>Thus you see what was the <hi>Custom</hi>

wore moderate hair generally. The so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

were the more <hi>Barbarous Nations</hi> that

            <p>Besides the <hi>Custom</hi> of those Nations

I might adjoyn what the usage of <hi>Others</hi>
hath been since. Among the <hi>Turks</hi> all
their Slaves are shaved, to shew ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Shameful and Vile a thing it is to be
destitute of hair; but they likewise shew
by their own example that they dislike
Long Hair, for they wear the hair of
their heads very short. Of their <hi>heads,</hi>
I say: for the hair of their <hi>Bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ds</hi> is
Long, in token, as they think, of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
(And here it may be generally
observed on the contrary, that those p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who suffer the hair of their heads
to grow to a great length, have little of
no Beards, as if the former made amends
for the want of these latter. Thus the
Antient <hi>Britatns</hi> (whom I mentioned
before) shaved all their Beard away ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
that growing on the upper <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not above twenty of thirty hairs: and
they paint a Deformed man with a thick
beard. On the other side, it might be
observed that there have been Extreams
as to <hi>beards,</hi> as well as <hi>the hair of the
head.</hi> Some have so nourirhed them as
if they emulated the name of that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>

               </gap>t of
people, doe not lavishly nourish the hair
of their heads, so a Different usage pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails
among the <hi>Rude Armenians,</hi> who
generally wear their hair Uncut, and as
long as it will grow, bound with laces,
and hanging down to their heels. These
Extreams on both hands have been care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
avoided by <hi>Christians,</hi> whole <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom</hi>
likewise I will in some part relate,
and so pass to the next General head.

The Primitive Saints of the Christian
Church, who were so strict and exact
in all other things, would not be defective
in this. They who refused to comply
with the Rites and Fashions of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>
(even when some of them were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent

Decent and moderate growth of the hair

Unlawful. And such even <hi>those of Age,</hi>

the <hi>Romish</hi> rite of Shaving Priests and
Nuns be thus repugnane to their own
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:99329:43"/>
Orders and Constitutions, and contrary
to the Practice before mentioned, yet it
is probable it was derived from some
Other practise and custom of the Church
in former days. And That, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
was this; the Antient Penitents
(as you may read) used to cut their
Hair and Beards as soon as they were
received again into the Church: and
hence might arise the Corrupt Custom
of lopping and polling the hair of their
heads, and at last it was thought suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to shave only one part, as is in
use among the Religious Orders of the
<hi>Roman Church.</hi> But now I desire you
to observe how the <hi>Decent and Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
wearing of the hair in men</hi> (which
our Apostle aims at here) is authorized
and commended by those <hi>Antient</hi> but
<hi>Contrary Practises</hi> which I have mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Since suffering the Hair to grow very
Long was a mark of Mortification among
the Old <hi>Monasticks,</hi> and was reckoned
such by some of the <hi>Benitents,</hi> who by
their Cutting their hair at their Restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Church shewed that they
took up the wearing of Long Hair as
a Penance or Punishment; and since on
the other side, Cutting the hair and even
Shaving have been and are still practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:99329:43"/>
by some men as tokens of Renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the world, and acts of Religious Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity,
it may be concluded from these
<hi>Vnusual</hi> and <hi>Extraordinary occurrences</hi>
(as I said before in the like case) what
was the <hi>Vsual</hi> and <hi>Constant practice</hi> of
the <hi>Christians</hi> in wearing their hair.
These things which I have alledged are
but Superstitious derivations from the
Stated course they observed. Wherefore
laying aside these Extreams, you know
what was the middle way they took.</p>
            <p>But I must add, that it was not <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition</hi>
and <hi>Fond Devotion</hi> only which made
<hi>Long Hair</hi> fashionable among <hi>Christians</hi>
at first. The Primitive Custom was alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the irruption of the <hi>Barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
viz.</hi> when the <hi>Longobards, Gothes,</hi>
and <hi>Vandals</hi> invaded the territories of the
Roman Empire. Long Hair began to be
worn in these <hi>European</hi> parts when those
<hi>Long-haird Barbarians</hi> violently broke
in upon these Countreys, and overtun
them. Among other evils and mischiefs
which they were the Authors of, and which
they left behind them in these parts,
This may justly be reckoned as one. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this time the <hi>Christians</hi> generally
wore moderately short hair. This is the
True Epoche of this Custom among
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:99329:44"/>
               <hi>Christians;</hi> and it is a sufficient Dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to it that it came in at the
same time that Rudeness, Violence and
Barbarity entred their quarters. And as
it was introduced into <hi>Europe</hi> by <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
people,</hi> so ever since, those who
have most of that character are the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers
and Practisers of it. It would
be too tedious to descend to Particular
Countries, and shew what effect this hath
had. Though this evil usage, brought
in by Savage people, prevail'd very much,
yet the folly and evil of it was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerned
by the Sober and Wife. These
constantly, in observance of the <hi>Apostle's
Canon</hi> here, wore their hair cut, and
moderately short. It was a great while
before <hi>Long Hair</hi> began to be Modish
with our Christian Ancestors in this Isle.
But when it was so, it soon met with
a check, for our<note n="g" place="margin">Matth. <hi>Westm. A. D.</hi> 1127.</note> 
               <hi>Chronicles</hi> acquaint
us that it was taken notice of by a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
of the Clergy in King <hi>Henry</hi> the
first's reign, and decreed against; and
the King himself, and by his example
all his Knights, submitted to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
and cut their hair short. So this
Excess was laid aside a great while, and
scarcely revived till about Sixty years
agoe, when we borrowed from <hi>France</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:99329:44"/>
this evil practice, as we have done many
others. If a Synod now should follow
the example of that before mentioned,
and shew their dislike of this general dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
it would be an act worthy of them.
Thus you have heard what hath been
the <hi>Custom</hi> concerning <hi>Long</hi> and <hi>Short
Hair.</hi> Now I will pass from <hi>Custom,</hi>
which is said to be a second Nature, to
the consideration of <hi>Nature It self</hi> as it
is properly so called.</p>
            <p>II. Taking <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> here in a stricter sense,
i. e. as it signifies the <hi>Inward Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
or Right Reason in our minds, let
us see whether <hi>This teacheth that a man</hi>
should not have <hi>Long Hair.</hi> It is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
before I go any further, that Long
Hair, as it is the product of Nature, as
such (I say) is not a thing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned;
for then it ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
in Women as well as in Men. It
is not to be denied that <hi>Nature</hi> hath
given Men long hair as well as the Other
Sex, if they will let it grow; as is clear
from the instances of those men (and I
have before informed you that there are
and have been such) who suffer their
hair to grow, and come down as low
as their feet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Again, I grant that wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of Long Hair is not Intrinsecally
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:99329:45"/>
Unlaw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ul, and Sinful in It self absolutely,
for what is so can never be otherwise:
but we know that it was Lawful in the
<hi>Nazarites,</hi> because it was commanded by
God. If Long Hair had been in its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick
nature, and immutably sinful, it
could not have been made otherwise by
God himself, and consequently it could not
have been enjoyned by him. Thus you
see in what sense <hi>Long Hair</hi> is <hi>not</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Law of Nature.</hi> Having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
this (which was requisite for the
understanding this matter aright) I will
shew how it <hi>was</hi> and <hi>is against Nature,</hi>
or the dictates of Natural Reason.</p>
            <p>First, you may judge of the Law of
Nature by the Practice of men. What
do All Nations agree in? How do the
Best and Wisest of all Countries behave
themselves in this affair? Which way
doth the Reason of mankind steer it self?
This you may be satisfied in from what
hath been said already. The Soberest
part of the world every where (<hi>Iews</hi> and
<hi>Infidels,</hi> as well as <hi>Christians</hi>) wear not
their hair at an Extravagant Length.
What was the reason that the <hi>Stoicks</hi>
cut their hair so short (as hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
before?) It was no other then
this, that they who were Immodest and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:99329:45"/>
Lewd wore Long Hair, but those that

Nature.</hi> So that these <hi>two</hi> first accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

            <p>Secondly, you may conclude that <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
or <hi>Right Reason</hi> forbids the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

is against the laws of <hi>Natural Decency</hi>

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:99329:46"/>
Apostle here in this Chapter, and even to
the end of the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> corrects the miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
of the <hi>Corintbians</hi> in their publick
meetings, and then concludes all thus,

               <hi>Let all things be done Decently.</hi> Whence
I rightly infer, that <hi>Indecency</hi> (which was
accompanied with <hi>Disorder</hi>) was their
great fault. Which one thing is a Key
to open the meaning of the Text, and
acquaints us that <hi>Natural Decency</hi> is to
be understood here by <hi>Nature.</hi> Which
is further confirmed by the words of the
Apostle in the verse immediately before
This, <hi>Is it comely that a woman pray unto
God uncovered?</hi> And from this very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Decency</hi> or <hi>Comeliness</hi> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
to argue in these words, <hi>Doth not
Nature it self teach you,</hi> &amp;c. [<hi>Is it come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?</hi>]
and [<hi>Doth not Nature teach you?</hi>]
are the same. Let us see then what this
<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, this <hi>Decorum,</hi> this <hi>Comeliness</hi>
signifies. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is to follow the order
of Nature in respect of Persons, Place,
Time, State or Condition, or any other
Circumstance whatsoever, and to act sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
according to the Variety of these.
And this <hi>Decorum</hi> is to be observed in
all External Actions, Words, Gestures
and Behaviour. When all these are
rightly ordered, then a person acts <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:99329:46"/>
or <hi>Fitly:</hi> but when these are not
observed, he acts <hi>Vnbecomingly,</hi> and
what he doth is <hi>Vnseemly</hi> and <hi>Vnsiting.</hi>
It was thought <hi>Indecent</hi> in grave <hi>Socrates</hi>
to be seen riding on a Cane, like a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
boy. The Senate of <hi>Areopagus,</hi>
that Grave and Reverend Judicatory at
<hi>Athens,</hi> made this Order,<note n="l" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch.</note> that none of
the Judges of that Bench should be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to write Comedies. The reason
was because it was <hi>Vnseemly</hi> and <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corous</hi>
for those Grave Senators to make
Plays. These were not <hi>fit persons</hi> for
such a purpose. <hi>Idem manebat, neque
idem decebat,</hi> said <hi>Tully</hi> of the famous
<hi>Hortensius.</hi> His way of Oratory and
of Action became him in his Youthful
years, but it had no Grace in Age. One
thing becomes one Time, another another.
And so this Law of <hi>Congruity</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruity</hi>
runs through all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of a mans life, as might be shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
This is particularly to be discerned
in the instance which is before us: <hi>Short</hi>
or <hi>Moderate hair</hi> is a thing <hi>Convenient</hi>
and <hi>Seemly</hi> in men, but the contrary is
<hi>Vnseemly, Incongruous, Vncomely,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is not suitable to the state and
condition of <hi>Men,</hi> who ought to do
things agreeable to their Rank and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:99329:47"/>
who ought to shew themselves
Manly and Grave, who ought to act
their part Wisely, who are convinced
that there is no time or place for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancy
and Folly, who have natural
impressions on their minds to encline
them to what is Serious, and who know
very well that this Garb we have been
speaking of, if it be considered in all its
circumstances and with all its appendages,
is Inconvenient and Unseemly. This
being so, <hi>Christians</hi> of all persons are to
avoid that Unseemly wearing of their
hair, because they are obliged by the
Apostles Injunction to <hi>do all things De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently,</hi>
and because the Indecent Length
of hair hath at least <hi>an appearance of evil,</hi>
which the same Inspired Writer bids them
<hi>abstain</hi> from. Thus <hi>Nature teacheth
that it is a shame for a man to wear long
hair,</hi> and that it is Honest and Decent,
and Becoming the Exactness of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to observe a Moderate Length. This
in general: but more particularly,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Even <hi>Natural Reason</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
to us the Apostle's advice, to
<hi>think on things which are of good report,</hi>
Phil. 4. 8. and to <hi>provide things ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
in the sight of all men,</hi> Rom. 12.
17. 2 Cor. 8. 21. Now these Rules
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:99329:47"/>
cannot be more useful in any case then
in the wearing of <hi>Habits,</hi> and of <hi>Hair.</hi>
These ought to be such as are generally
reputed Honest and Laudable, and have
the good word of Sober men. <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
it seems, was accused of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Inconstancy by the people of
<hi>Carthage</hi> for laying aside the use of the
<hi>Gown</hi> (the common habit of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>)
and putting on the <hi>Cloak</hi> (the
usual vestment of the <hi>Grecians:</hi>) but
he apologizeth for himself, telling them
that he made choice of the <hi>Pallium</hi> as
the <hi>Fittest</hi> and <hi>most Becoming Habit,</hi> and
which was of <hi>Good Esteem and Repute</hi>
among the <hi>Wisest persons,</hi> who are the
most Competent Judges of the rules of
Decency and Sobriety. It was, saith he,
of great <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and so he could not be
blamed for affecting Novelty, and wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an Upstart Habit. Besides, it was
a very <hi>Vseful</hi> and <hi>Serviceable</hi> sort of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel,
and on that account also it could
not but be esteemed Honest and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
Again, among the <hi>Grecians</hi> it was
the proper habit of <hi>Philosophers,</hi> who
were the Soberest and Antientest persons
among them, and therefore was fittest for
<hi>Christians,</hi> especially for <hi>Priests;</hi> and it
was at that time generally made use of by
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:99329:48"/>
them: accordingly he wore it as soon as
he was made <hi>Presbyter</hi> of the Church
of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and he is pleased to call it
a <hi>Priests Habit.</hi> Thus he followed those
Rules of the Apostle exactly. And they
are as useful and practical in the <hi>Other case,</hi>
of <hi>wearing the Hair:</hi> which ought to
be in that manner which is accounted
<hi>Honest,</hi> and is <hi>of Good Report,</hi> that is,
approved of by the Best and Wisest men,
that hath the good liking of the Sobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
and Gravest Christians, and that is
practised by them, and not by Russians.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Natural Reason</hi> teacheth us
that <hi>Long Hair</hi> is unlawful as it is any
ways subservient to <hi>Pride, Wantonness,</hi>
and <hi>Effeminacy.</hi> This is true, whether
we speak of mens Own Hair, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be Borrowed, and worn in lieu
of their Own, as is the common pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of these times. I am far from the
thinking that the wearing of a <hi>Peruke,</hi>
barely considered, is Unlawful. There
may be occasion for borrowed hair in
case of Necessity, want of Health, some
unavoidable Infirmity, or Decay and
Loss of that Natural Covering which
they had. But now it is the custom,
when neither Health, nor any Other ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
cause can be assigned, to clap on a
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:99329:48"/>
false head of hair, as if <hi>hair were given
women for a Covering,</hi> not for themselves
(as the Apostle meant it,) but for Men.
But this Needless use of false hair is
not all that is to be blamed in the men
of this age. They are yet more guilty,
for they affect an <hi>Extravagant Length</hi> of
hair, which is the fruit of <hi>Vnmanly Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
and <hi>Pride,</hi> I will not say in <hi>all,</hi> but
in <hi>many</hi> that use it. This Effeminate
garb doth generally betray a weak and
infirm mind; it is a sign of a want of
other and better Head-Furniture. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
it is attended with an immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
love of Softness and Delicacy. When
they thus Extravagantly load them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with Womans hair, they become
Wanton and Luxurious, Soft and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manish.
These are none of <hi>Samson's</hi>
breed, their <hi>Strength</hi> lies not in their
<hi>Locks,</hi> yea they are made feeble and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
by them. These Wanton La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
are in the generality of persons that
wear them as noted marks of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
as a <hi>Fillet</hi> in Heraldry is of effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minacy,
and as <hi>Gussets</hi> and a <hi>Goar si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister</hi>
are signs there of Cowardize and
Womanish disposition.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, it might be added that so far
<hi>as Long Hair</hi> may prove <hi>Incommodious</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:99329:49"/>
and <hi>Cumber some,</hi> and be a Hindrance to
men in their Business (which they best
know and are sensible of whose heads
are hung with this <hi>Trouble some Tackle</hi>)
it must needs be pronounced to be <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Nature,</hi> and the Law of our Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
faculties, for this approves of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which really Incommodes us, and
is an impediment to us in any of the
necessary offices of our lives. If a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Vanity did not posses these mens
minds, and strangely harden them, they
would count those <hi>Ell-Wiggs</hi> an intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Luggage, and would beg to be rid
of them. They would complain that
these hang in their way, and even im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede
their Eating and Drinking, the
greatest business of their lives. Or, if
we could imagine this sort of persons to
be <hi>Warriours,</hi> they would then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
feel the mischief of this Incumbrance
which they carry about them, and we
should soon see them leave these <hi>Horse-Tails</hi>
to the Enemy as the <hi>Ensigns</hi> and
Trophies of their folly.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the <hi>Natural Law of Reason</hi>
bids men doe nothing that is <hi>Shameful</hi>
and <hi>Opprobious, Disgraceful</hi> and <hi>Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable;</hi>
but such is a mans <hi>having of
Long Hair.</hi> It is, saith the Apostle, a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:99329:49"/>
               <hi>shame</hi> to him; or rather, it should have
been translated <hi>dishonour,</hi> for it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
in the Greek, and is opposed to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in
the next verse, which shews this ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
of the word to be most proper.
If a man wear long hair, it is a <hi>Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
to him, it being doing that which
is unworthy of his <hi>peculiar Sex,</hi> and so
is <hi>Vnnatural:</hi> which leads me to the
next Particular which I propounded.
But before I enter upon That, I will summ
up the foregoing heads, that you may
at one view discern how <hi>Nature</hi> (i. e.
Natural Reason, which dictates what is
Good and what is Bad) <hi>teacheth</hi> the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulness
of <hi>Long Hair, viz.</hi> As it is
against the Judgement and Practice of
the Soberest race of men in all Regions
of the world, as it is against Natural
Decency and Comeliness, as it is a thing
not of Good Report, so far as it may
serve to Pride and Lewdness, so far as
it may prove an Impediment, and lastly,
as it is a Disgrace and Dishonour to the
Sex. These things being thus, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
excuse the Learned<note n="m" place="margin">De C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Salmasius,</hi> who

Long Locks, that he will not suffer a
mans hair to reach any further then his
ears. It must only cover his Skill, he
saith in another place. And at last he
tells us that to wear hair below the ears
is such a sin as deserves Eternal Death:
But may we not ask this Damning man,
What is the Hair of the head for? If
it be not of <hi>some Length</hi> and <hi>Thickness,</hi>
it is not for use, and so Nature gave
it in vain. Is it not agreed on by all the
Understanding part of mankind, that the
Hair of the head was given to cover
it from the cold, and to guard and shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it from the winds, or other assaults?
And is it possible it should do this if it
be so Clipp'd and Poll'd as some would
have it? No: this design of Nature
cannot be accomplished. It is granted
likewise by all men of sober thoughts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that <hi>Nature</hi> intended the Hair of the
head to be a <hi>Comely Adorning</hi> to it,
which it cannot be if it be not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to display it self in some measure,
especially if it be reduced to that Low
Cut which was mentioned before. Here
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:99329:50"/>
then we are concerned to avoid <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams</hi>
on one side or other. As a man
must not go like a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> or a <hi>Greek
Philosopher,</hi> or like a <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him, so neither must he appear like a

<hi>Affrighted Iew</hi> in his days of Mourning
with his hair torn off, like a <hi>Cropt Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick,</hi>
or like a <hi>Shaven Monk.</hi> But there
is a <hi>Decent Medium</hi> to be prefer'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
these, and to be practised, that is,
to wear the hair with a Convenient
Shortness, or a moderate Length, call
it which you will. This matter is easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
decided by peaceable and sober minds,
though some have made a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
of it, insomuch that it hath
been called <hi>Bellum Capillare.</hi> This is
certain, that no man can prescribe a Just
Exact Measure, a Precise Length: for
this may alter according to the age, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and quality of the person, yea even
according to the dimensions of his neck.
We must not be Curious here, we
must not be Censorious and Quarrelsom,
we must not create Scruples and Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.
Any Sober and well Considerate
man, who makes his <hi>Reason</hi> his Rule,
will easily determine in this affair.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:99329:51"/>
III. <hi>The Difference of Sexes,</hi> which is
another signification of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
teacheth that if a man have <hi>Long Hair,</hi>
it is a shame and dishonour to him: for
wearing the hair in a Different manner
is one badg of the <hi>Sex.</hi> Difference of
Habits distinguishes one Sex from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
accordingly <hi>Hair,</hi> which is a sort
of <hi>Habit,</hi> is a distinction of the Sexes.
First, the hair of the face which we call
<hi>Beards,</hi> is as it were the <hi>Clothing</hi> of the
face. Some indeed have pulled these
up by the roots, or shaved the place
very close, as many of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and
<hi>Romans</hi> used to do: but others let them
grow, and that to a considerable length,
as the Old Philosophers generally did.
<hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperour (as we have noted
before) was the first that brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Romans</hi> the fashion of Beards:
before that time they usually had no hair
on their chins or lips. But this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
is against <hi>Nature,</hi> it taking away
that which is one <hi>Distinction between
the Sexes.</hi> Hence God forbad his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
not only to <hi>round</hi> (i. e. to shave
all round) <hi>the corners of their heads,</hi>
but to <hi>mar the corners of their beards,</hi>
Lev. 19. 27. This latter, <hi>viz.</hi> the
spoiling of the angles of the Beard by
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:99329:51"/>
cutting all off round, seems to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to <hi>Nature,</hi> and consequently
is as <hi>Shameful</hi> as the former. And there
is nothing to excuse the general custom
at this day among us of shaving off the
Beard, and going with Smooth Chins
like women, but this, that the Cutting
or Not cutting of the Beard is not so
Great a Distinction of the Sexes as the
ordering of the Hair of the Head: for
both men and women are furnished with
Hair on their heads, but several people
in the world are without Beards, that is,
no hair grows on their faces. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
this <hi>Beardless fashion</hi> is the more
tolerable, as long as the <hi>Other Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
of the Sexes, <hi>viz.</hi> Clothes of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and Hair of the head are kept up.
And therefore it appears hence that we
ought to be the more concerned for this
latter. By the Hair of the Head there
is a plain discrimination made between
Man and Woman. And yet I do not
say that <hi>simply</hi> and <hi>absolutely</hi> speaking,
it is a Distinction instituted by <hi>Nature,</hi>
because Nature hath made the Hair of
Male and Female alike. Though a <hi>Beard</hi>
seems to be a Natural Distinction, yet
<hi>the Hair of the Head</hi> is not. But then
This is to be said, that it is <hi>Natural</hi> to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:99329:52"/>
               <hi>distinguish the Sexes,</hi> and the Wearing
of the <hi>Hair</hi> being through custom agreed
upon among all Nations to be one Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
between the Sexes, it follows that
it is Natural and Reasonable to observe
this Distinction. Now if a Man wear
his hair as long as a Woman, the Sex
is not discerned, which is against the
Law and Decree of Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> that
the Distinction of Sexes is to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and not confounded. The very
summ of the first part of This Chapter
to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> is, that Women must
not be forgetful of their <hi>Sex.</hi> There is
a Modesty and Shamefac'dness proper to
them, as the consequent of the Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
they owe, which is to be shew'd
by putting on a <hi>Veil.</hi> Though they
had Supernatural Gifts (as the Apostle
here supposeth,) yet they were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
their peculiar station and Sex.
And so here the same thing is urged,
<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Difference of Sexes</hi> made by
God and Nature. This teacheth the
man that it is Unfit for him to wear
<hi>Long Hair,</hi> for hereby the Difference of
Sexes would be taken away. We must
not do things contrary to or unbecoming
our Sex. That is Decorous and Seemly
in a Man which is not in a Woman, and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:99329:52"/>
so <hi>vice versâ.</hi> It must needs then be
a shame to a Man to have hair of the
Length which a Woman hath: for then
he is truly <hi>Travestie,</hi> dressed in anothers
Clothes, (which is the import of that
French word,) and for which he may
be justly <hi>Ridicul'd.</hi> And This certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is the <hi>Shame</hi> of This Age wherein
we live, Though it is not so accounted,
but rather, the Contrary is thought
Shameful and Disgracefull. We may in
our days alter and transpose the Apostle's
words, and say, <hi>If a man hath Short hair,
it is a Shame to him: but if a woman have
Short hair, nay, if she hath none, it is a
Glory to her.</hi> That Sex which used not
to nourish the hair, now doth, or rather
makes use of the hair which others should
nourish: and the Other Sex which used
to have their hair at the utmost Length,
now cut it off and give it to the man.
It is true, still the Distinction of the
Sexes is preserved, though the <hi>Marks</hi> and
<hi>Badges</hi> of it be Contrary to what they
were herertofore. But notwithstanding
this, here is a Perverting and Confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Natural and Primitive Order,
a casting off the received Tokens which
used to distinguish the Sexes of man and
woman. Thus you see how <hi>Nature it
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:99329:53"/>
self teacheth that if a man have Long
hair, it is a shame to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hitherto I have considered the word
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the <hi>first sense,</hi> i. e. as it denotes
<hi>having Long hair,</hi> or Loose hair which
hangeth down at length, and is without
any Artificial Ornament. But as <hi>This</hi>
is a frequent signification of the word,
so there is <hi>another, viz.</hi> to have hair
not only Long and Uncut, but to <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of it after the manner of Women,</hi>
to <hi>deck</hi> and <hi>adorn it.</hi> This is a known
signification of the Greek word in the
Text: yea, some will have this to be
the Primary and Proper denotation of
the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Here then I will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine,
1. What this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> was, wherein
consisted the <hi>wearing of hair like Women,</hi>
in respect of its Dress and Ornament?
2. Whether the Apostle <hi>here</hi> means Hair
of this kind? 3. How <hi>Nature teacheth</hi>
men that they ought not to wear such
hair?</p>
            <p>I. What is it <hi>to wear hair like wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men?</hi>
For we shall not be able to tell
what <hi>men are taught</hi> to do when they
are forbid to <hi>have such hair,</hi> unless we
know first what that hair was, <hi>viz.</hi> in
regard of its Composure and Dress. You
must know then, that women did not
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:99329:53"/>
wear their hair at Length, though it
was Long, for they tied it up, and to
this purpose made use of fillets, laces,
ribbands. And they did not truss and
wrap up their hair confusedly, but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
it into several divisions: and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
they had Pins to divide the
hair. It is no small piece of Learning
to be acquainted even with the <hi>Attire
of Women</hi> from the Antientest Writers.
From them we may learn that all the
<hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> yea and all <hi>Europaean</hi>
women bound up their hair in a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
manner. It is true, at Funerals,
and when Extraordinary Grief surprized
them, they let their hair down about
their shoulders, but from this custom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
it is clear that at <hi>Other times</hi> they
wore it after another fashion, that is,
they neatly tied it up one way or other,
and suffered it not to hang down dishe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veld.
Yea, they gathered it sometimes
into a knot on the top of their heads:
the <hi>Hebrew, Greek,</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> women
wore their hair thus. And it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
this fantastick <hi>Top-knot</hi> of their own
hair is taken notice of and reproved by
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 9. where he tells
us that the Christian women must not
be adorned <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:99329:54"/>
[<hi>with broidred hair,</hi>] but the word
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> among the <hi>Greeks</hi> signified that
<hi>Curled Lock</hi> or <hi>Tower</hi> which the women
wore on the top of their heads, and by
the <hi>Latins</hi> was call'd <hi>Corymbus.</hi> This
you may satisfie your selves in from the
best <hi>Lexicographers.</hi> But though this
was a Particular use of the word among
the <hi>Greeks,</hi> yet here it may have a Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
meaning, and signifie also the Other
excesses and follies the women were then
guilty of in dressing their hair. This
is elegantly called in <hi>Isai.</hi> 3. 24. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>calamistri opus:</hi> there was a great
deal of <hi>Workmanship</hi> in that effeminate
dressing of the hair, it was an <hi>Elaborate</hi>
piece of art to dispose and order it aright.
Accordingly from the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> comes
the verb <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>crines ornare,</hi> which
the Greeks express likewise by the word
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is akin to that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
named: whence you may guess what
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> are, in the more comprehensive
sense of the word. We render it (as
I have said) by [<hi>broidred hair,</hi>] but
I conjecture the word is falsly set down,
by the fault of the Printers 'tis likely.
<hi>Broided</hi> is the word used by <hi>Coverdale</hi>
and <hi>Tindal</hi> here, whence our Last Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slators
took it, but in Transcribing or
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:99329:54"/>
Printing it was corrupted: which ought
to be taken notice of by those who have
the Inspection of these things in our
Church, that we may not make use of
a false and mistaken Version, for [<hi>Broi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi>]
was mistook for [<hi>broided,</hi> or
<hi>braided</hi>] (for both these words were
heretofore in use.) Now, <hi>braiding the
hair</hi> is the same with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the hair,</hi> which is forbid by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
1 <hi>Epist.</hi> 3. ch. 3. v. Though the
hair might be put up decently, yet it
was not to be <hi>braided</hi> or <hi>plaited;</hi> by which
word, and by that other before named,
all Lust and Wantonness in Trimming
the head is condemned by those two A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles.
The <hi>Magnasheh Miksheh,</hi> the
<hi>well-set hair,</hi> the laborious Curling, Friz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and Crisping the hair, which was
then in use, and all other Gaudy and
Wanton Dressing of it are here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
Unlawful, and not fit to be
practised by women professing Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
The short then is, that Women
heretofore did always wear their hair <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut,</hi>
and because of its <hi>Length</hi> they did
not suffer it to hang about their ears,
but tied it up, and decently disposed of
it: but at last this Decent Ordering of
their hair degenerated into an Indecent
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:99329:55"/>
Trimming, into a Lewd and Wanton Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
it. It is the former of these
which is expressed here in this one word
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. This signifies the Womanish Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
forth and Adorning of the hair, the
wearing of hair as Women wear it.
The <hi>Grammarians</hi> in the propriety and
differences of words which they make,
tell us that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is properly of Women,
as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> &amp; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of Men. <hi>Com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> est ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillus
aliquâ curâ compositus,</hi> say the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of Grammer and Criticism. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
some of them derive it from
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>curare, colere, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of, trim, deck, adorn. Therefore <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
is <hi>Womens hair</hi> properly, because it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
great Care and Art to keep it,
dress it, and tie it up. So <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is to
be carefull about the hair, decently to
gather it together, and to dispose of it:
whence Loose and Squalid hair is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in all Good Authors to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
Thus I have done with the First De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
what <hi>the wearing of hair like wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> is.</p>
            <p>II. I am to shew you that the Apostle
speaks here of <hi>This very wearing of hair.</hi>
The <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which is mentioned twice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
(in this, and the next verse) is
meant of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ame thing: this will not
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:99329:55"/>
be denied, I suppose. Now the latter
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, applied to the <hi>woman,</hi> cannot be
meant of <hi>Long Hair</hi> only and simply,
but also of hair which is Ordered and
Fashioned according to the use of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:
and that for these two Reasons.
First, because it is said to be her <hi>Glory:</hi>
but tis well known that Hair Hanging
down and Disheveld is no <hi>Glory,</hi> no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament,
no Honou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and neve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> was
thought to be to any of that Sex. When
the Apostle saith, <hi>If a woman doth</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>it is a glory to her,</hi> he cannot intend
Long Hair absolutely, and sol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly, for
that was no <hi>Comliness</hi> or <hi>Decorum,</hi> much
less, <hi>Glory</hi> to the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Roman,</hi> or
any <hi>Europaean</hi> women<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
it was thought Indecent, and was
a sign of Neglect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ness and Squ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lidity,
and therefore used in case of great Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Lamentation. Secondly, in this
same verse it is said that the womans hair
<hi>is given her,<note n="n" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> pro vela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</note> for a Covering.</hi> Hence
then I gather that this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> must not be
mere Long Hair hanging down, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
cut. This indeed covers the neck
and shoulders, but it is no more a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
to the head</hi> then short or Cut
hair. Therefore it must be meant not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of hair worn at Length, but of the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:99329:56"/>
Binding up the hair in an Artificial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
to do the service of a <hi>Veil,</hi> and in
the way of a real <hi>Covering</hi> to the head.
When it is tied up, and in several parts
made up together, and fastned to the
head, it is a <hi>Covering,</hi> whereas if it hang
at Length, and be Loose and Flowing,
it is not a <hi>Covering,</hi> or if it be one, it
is as much a Covering to the other parts
of the body as to the head. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
would have women cover or veil
their <hi>heads,</hi> with their own Hair; and
he intimates at the same time that this
<hi>Natural Covering</hi> dictates what they
should do moreover, that is, add an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial
one,</hi> a <hi>Veil</hi> over their heads, as
often as they go into the publick Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
and are ingaged in solemn acts of
Religion and Worship. God giving them
the <hi>Veil of Hair,</hi> and by that as it were
tells them they must be covered with <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
They are to have a Double Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering;
one Nature supplies them with,
Art must afford the other: and if they
cast off this latter, they may as well cast
off the former. This you find to be
the Apostle's way of arguing (whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you think of it) in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Chapter, where he acquaints
the Christian women of <hi>Corinth,</hi> that <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:99329:56"/>
with their heads uncovered is even all
one as if they were shaven:</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
he adds, <hi>If a woman be not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
let her also be shorn. Nature</hi> doth
as it were shew the way in this case,
and lets women know that they must
cover their heads in time of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
Why so? Because Nature hath
given them Hair <hi>for a Covering:</hi> it tells
them they must have a <hi>Veil.</hi> But what
kind of Hair is this? It is Long Hair,
but not hanging at length, it is gather'd
and tied up, and made as it were into a
<hi>Cap</hi> or <hi>Covering</hi> for the head. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
then that the Apostle here speaks
against those <hi>Corinthian</hi> men who were
Effeminate and Wanton, who at that
time wore their hair after the manner of
Women, who artificially wrapt it up, and
dressed and adorned it after the fashion
of that Sex. The Apostle forbids the
Men to wear their hair thus: this is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>coma,</hi> properly so called, and belongs to
a <hi>Woman.</hi> This Gathering and Tying,
and Adorning the hair is the womans
Natural Veil or Covering for her head,
and given her to that purpose. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is
her proper Ornament, and is even stiled
by the Apostle, her <hi>Glory,</hi> as hath been
often said. But this, as lawful as it is
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:99329:57"/>
in Women, becomes Unlawful and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in the Masculine Sex. If a Man makes
use of it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>If he wears his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hair
like a woman,</hi> i. e. Gathered up, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by art, it is a <hi>shame</hi> to him. Not
only <hi>Long Hair</hi> but <hi>Adorned Hair</hi> is
not permitted to Man, but is <hi>against
Nature.</hi> Which is the</p>
            <p>III. thing I am to undertake, <hi>viz.</hi> to
shew how <hi>Nature teacheth</hi> that a Man
ought not to wear his hair after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
And here we will take the word
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the <hi>Tripple</hi> sense which we took
it in before, <hi>viz.</hi> as it signifies <hi>Custom,
Natural Reason,</hi> and <hi>Difference of Sex.</hi>
First, it is not to be denied that many
Men among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> went with the
Attire of their Hair like Women. It is
easily proved out of History that the
<hi>Crecian</hi> Men kept their hair uncut and
unpoll'd, and were very vain and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
in dressing it. They used to perfume;
cut and crisp their hair, and to take a
great deal of care about it. Yea, the
<hi>Spartans</hi> went even to the Wars with
their hair artificially combed and adorned.
The <hi>Corinthians,</hi> among other <hi>Grecians,</hi>
degenerated into this effeminate wearing
of their hair, which the Apostle here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
them for. But among the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:99329:57"/>
particularly a Knot of hair tied up,
and standing upright on their crowns
was the universal fashion even among
the Men. This was called by them
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> &amp; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: this latter word is
used (as you have heard) by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, and perhaps refers particularly to
this fashion. It was also called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
a <hi>Scorpion,</hi> because perhaps it was part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
framed in the figure of a <hi>Scorpion</hi>
or <hi>Snake;</hi> it twirled about like such an
animal, for which reason also a <hi>Curled
Lock</hi> of hair is called a <hi>Worm</hi> in our
modern stile. <hi>Salmasius</hi> hath proved from
<hi>Lucian, Virgil,</hi> and other Authors that
this <hi>Top-Lock</hi> or <hi>Curl'd Tuft</hi> of hair on
the crown of the head was the fashion
of Other Nations besides the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
This and other excesses of the like kind
were used by the Men among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
also, as appears from those Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
who took notice of them, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed
against them. <hi>Ovid</hi> jerks those
Effeminate Men who will not let a hair
be amiss or out of its place,
<q>Quisque suas ponunt in statione comas.</q>
               <note n="o" place="margin">Sat. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Iuvenal</hi> corrects the pride of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Gallants in wearing their hair finely
dressed: and<note n="p" place="margin">

the same Effeminacy. Nay, not only
the Jeering Poets took notice of their
Luxury and Extravagancy in this point,
but the Gravest Moralists thought it a

then their Hair. In short, he rebukes
them for being so busie between the Glass

sign they have a greater desire to be
Sptuce and Fine then Honest. But <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi>
were not the only persons that
were infected with this folly. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the<note n="q" place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. 3.</note>

saith, It is not lawful to nourish the hair,

That it was not so among the
<hi>Pagans</hi> is evident from the Reproofs
which it met with from the Sober and
Grave among them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> yea, from the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Facetious. And that it obtained
not among <hi>Christians</hi> is manifest, because
it is checked here by the <hi>Apostle</hi> as a
single miscarriage of the Christians of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth:</hi>
and <hi>Councels, Fathers</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi>
have reproved it in their Decrees,
Sermons and Discourses, as the fault of
<hi>some</hi> only. The short is, there were two
Contrary Practises or Customs on foot
at that time, one of the Rude and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched
part of the world, the other of
the Better and Civilized fort of people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
now, we cannot think that the Apostle
appeals here to the Custom of the former,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:99329:59"/>
but of the latter: for we cannot imagine
that this Holy Man would propound the
Worst of men as an example to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
of <hi>Corinth</hi> to follow. Whence
we may certainly infer that he doth not
mean here the Custom of the Rude and
Immoral, but of the Civil part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
He tells the <hi>Corinthians</hi> that if
they will conduct their lives by the usual
practise of these, they may be sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
furnished with Examples, all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
part of the world act after this
manner, that is, they detest the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manish
wearing of their hair. The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest,
Wise and Sober in all Nations
and in all Ages have opposed this practice,
it being disagreeable to the dictates of
Reason in all understanding and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
persons. Which brings me to the
next Particular.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Nature it self,</hi> i. e. the
dictate of Natural Reason, Natures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
and Common Sense teach this,
that a Man is not to wear hair like a
Woman. The Manly Sex is forbid by
the Law of Nature to have hair after
the manner of the Female sex. Natural
Reason d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ctates against <hi>Adorned Hair in
men</hi> on the same accounts that it was
against their <hi>Long Hair, viz.</hi> because it is
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:99329:59"/>
Indecent, because it is of no Good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
because it is subservient to Pride
and Wantonness, because it is contrary
to the Practise of those who are most
guided by the conduct of Reason, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
But I will insist only on the first of these,
the <hi>Natural Indecency</hi> of the thing. Here
then, as before, we are to take notice
that there is a Decency and Fitness to
be observed and followed by all that own
either Reason or Religion, There is

or Natural Reason teacheth that
<hi>Adorned hair in men</hi> is Indecent and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting,

The Learned <hi>Salmasius,</hi> who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands

or that Law of Nature which teacheth

Acception of the word. I need not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
repeat here what I said before, that
<hi>Nature</hi> is taken in Good Writers in this
sense: That I think is unquestionable.
Now I am only to prove that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
which is between the two Sexes
is sufficient foundation for This Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
<hi>viz.</hi> that a man should not wear

But in particular this <hi>Decorum</hi> is that
which is peculiar and appropriated to one
or the other Sex. There are certain
boundaries which part both Sexes. That
which is decent in one is not so in the
other, and never can be. It is true <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
would have Women train'd up to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Exercise and feats of Arms, that,
if there should be necessity, they might
defend their Country. But this was a
Fanciful project of the Philosopher, as
many of his are: and others of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
Philosophers were ashamed of it.
One Sex must not incroach on the other,
and usurp the rights and usages proper
to it. As (to appro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Habit and Dress which belongs to
Women, and there is another which is

The Law of God which was given to

Distinction of Habits, and strictly forbids
that people to disguise themselves in the

hath kept up a Distinction of Habit or

                  <l>Quae fugit à sexu?</l>
               </q>
was of the like opinion as to <hi>Women,
viz.</hi> that they cannot without putting
off Shame and Modesty put on the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel
of Men. And if <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi>
have thus declared their sentiments as
to this particular, you may expect that
<hi>Christians</hi> have not been behind them.
It was the peremptory determination of
the Councel of <hi>Gangra</hi> that a woman
is not to wear m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ns clothes, nor a man
the womans. And there have been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Laws made by the Church, and also
by the Secular Magistrates to refrain dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
in this kind. For they thought
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:99329:62"/>
that a Fitting and Distinct Dress is a
good guard of Honesty, is serviceable to
promote Modesty and Shamefac'dness,
and to hinder the violating of Chastity.
Briefly, All Nations and Countries have
observed this Distinction, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have had Proper and Distinct Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for the Sexes. This was pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
of what our Apostle here saith, that
<hi>Nature teaches this,</hi> i. e. Nature which
distinguisheth the Sexes, Nature which
hath every where made a Discrimination
between Male and Female, Nature which
makes a Difference not only as to Clothes
of the body, but as to the manner of
wearing the Hair of the head: for the
Hair both of the Head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Beard is a
Natural Clothing, and is rightly called
by <hi>Salmasius, altera vestis.</hi> The Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of Men and Women ought to be
manisested by this very Clothing. The
Different wearing of the <hi>Hair</hi> distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth
the <hi>Sexes.</hi> Nature which hath
made a Difference between male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,
dictates also that they are to be
Differenced as to This.</p>
            <p>But you will say, Nature teacheth not
the way of Differencing the Sexes by
the wearing of <hi>Hair,</hi> for All People a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
not as to the manner of wearing
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:99329:63"/>
it. In some Countries the woman is
distinguished from the man by having
Short hair, and the man from the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
by Long Hair tied up, and never
cut. I Answer, 1. The practice of <hi>some</hi>
Nations and people as to this thing is
no Argument. It is sufficient that the
<hi>Generality</hi> of the Best and most Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized
people observe. This manner of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
between the Sexes, which I have
proved they do. 2. I have before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that there is something of <hi>Natural
Decency</hi> and Fitness in distinguishing the
Sexes by this Particular Manner of wearing
the hair. 3. Though I should say with
<hi>Salmasius,</hi> that Nature teacheth not the
Particular way of differencing the Sexes
as to Hair, yet this I must say, that when
<hi>Custom</hi> and <hi>Institution</hi> have settled such
a Particular way, <hi>Nature</hi> then teacheth
us to observe it, it bids us not break
the Distinction, but keep it up. We
see there are Different Usages and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
in different Countries, but the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
is Honesty or Dishonesty in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
several of them, though they
be Different, yea almost Contrary. Good
and Laudable <hi>Customs</hi> are a <hi>Law</hi> in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places; they are so in This Land:
and Reason, which is the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:99329:63"/>
teacheth us to observe these. Say
then that This of the Text was a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Custom only, say that it was a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
Precept (as there are several such
in S<hi rend="sup">•</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles,) calculated only
for such a place and certain time, yet
the Precept nearly concerns us. For
though we are not <hi>immediately</hi> obliged
to this Individual and Particular thing,
yet because the <hi>Reason of the Precept</hi>
obliges us, we are on that account, though
more <hi>remotely,</hi> ingaged to observe this
very thing. On this consideration<note n="e" place="margin">De C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

at that time, which the Apostle refers
to, be not in use with us at this day,
yet the <hi>General Rule</hi> of keeping up <hi>a
Difference between the Sexes</hi> is still va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
and obligatory, and will always be so.
This is certain and fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed, and never to
be shaken, that Nature hath made a Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the Sexes, and that it is
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:99329:64"/>
a Sin to confound them. And it is not
to be denied that this Difference of
Sexes is to be manifested by Different
Habit and Apparel, to which appertain
Wearing the Hair. And this in the
times of the <hi>Apostle</hi> was after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
Hair hanging down, and moderately
cut was proper to Man, and Long Hair,
but tied up and with some art disposed
was proper to the Woman; for the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of Men and Womens hair con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
not only in the Length, but in
the Disposing and Dressing of it. It is
Manly to cut the hair, and neglect the
adorning of it: it is Womanish to let it
grow, to gather it up orderly and with
some innocent art. This is the <hi>Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of Sexes</hi> made by the <hi>Hair</hi> which
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of. This is that which
was suggested by the Author of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical
Constitutions,</hi> speaking of that
Law in <hi>Leviticus, Thou shalt no round the

to confound this in the Sexes, that is,
for a Man to wear his hair after the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manish
way, and for the Woman to wear
hers after the way which is proper to
Men, is Unchristian, Impious, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural.
This, in conjunction with what
I have said before, I take to be the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle's
meaning in these words, <hi>Doth not
even Nature it self</hi> (and with it <hi>Custom</hi>)
<hi>teach you, that if a man hath Long hair,</hi>
and <hi>disposes of it in that manner which
women do, it is a shame, it is a dishonour
to him? But if a woman have Long hair,
and wears it after that way of Dress which
is proper to her Sex, the law of Nature, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Vsage of the sober part of
the world teacheth that it is a glory to her.</hi>
This I offer as the Full and Complete
sense of the Apostle in this Text.</p>
            <p>And now though I have finished my
task, yet because This place of Scripture
about <hi>men and womens Hair</hi> comes in
here only by the by, and is not the Main
thing intended by the Apostle, but is
brought to prove what he had urged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that <hi>women praying or prophesying
should cover their heads, and men uncover
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:99329:65"/>
theirs,</hi> it being (I say) brought in here
as an Argument to prove the Decency of
such a practice in time of Divine Worship,
which is the Main and Principal thing
the Apostle urgeth in the beginning of
this Chapter, therefore I will annex here
something of this subject, and shew you
what hath been the Practice of the world
as to this, and How, and for what Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
the Apostle presseth it here. And
though my chief design is to speak of
this custom of <hi>Covering</hi> or <hi>Vncovering the
head</hi> as it was used in <hi>Divine Worship,</hi>
yet, to shew the utmost extent of this
practice, I shall say something as I go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
concerning this usage in <hi>General</hi> and
<hi>Civil Conversation.</hi> I will begin first
with the practice of the <hi>Iews</hi> and other
<hi>Eastern</hi> people. As for the Common
and Civil usage among them they sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
were Bare-headed in publick. And
the mode used in Civil conversation gave
the rule also for Religious Worship. The
<hi>Iews</hi> went always with their heads co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
and so continued even at Divine
Worship: and most of the <hi>Eastern</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
did the like. The <hi>Iews</hi> of old, both
Priests that sacrificed, and People that
were present, had their heads covered.
Not only women but men hid their heads
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:99329:65"/>
and faces with a Veil when they pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as the Learned<note n="h" place="margin">Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the N. Test. 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11.</note> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Lightfoot</hi> hath
proved. The Hebrew Doctors who tell
us that they came in this posture into
the Temple, and there remain'd so all
the time of the Service, tell us also,
that they did it out of pure Reverence,
and for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ear of seeing the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
as they speak. And from the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
this was derived to the <hi>Synagogues,</hi>
and with some addition, for in these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
you may at this day see them (not
only those that Officiate, but the whole
Congregation) pray standing with the
Ordinary Covering on their heads, and
over that likewise they cast a <hi>Veil.</hi>
This people he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>etofore, when they so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
<hi>Mourned</hi> (which was a piece of
Religion,) veiled their heads, besides that
they covered them with Dust and Ashes.
Of this <hi>Mourning Covering,</hi> which was
added to their Ordinary one, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
often speaks, as in the 2 <hi>Sam. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y other places. This was also used
by Other Nations in the <hi>East,</hi> as the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians;</hi>
Thus <hi>Haman mourned, having his
head covered,</hi> Esther 6. 12. And this
was a Prologue to another and Worse

face,</hi> which was done immediately
upon the Kings being displeased with him,
for Covering the face or head was a sign
among them of being cast out of savour.
This afterwards was in use among the
<hi>Iews,</hi> and was a token of, <hi>Condemnation:</hi>
and accordingly you read that when <hi>Christ</hi>
was <hi>condemned to be guilty of death, some
began to cover his face,</hi> Mark 14. 64,
65. But passing this by, I am concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
at present in the more <hi>usual and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Covering</hi> which the <hi>Iews</hi> used.
Their Priests had a Particular Covering
for their heads, which is called <hi>Migba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noth,
Ex. 29. 9. Lev. 8. 13. Exod. 28.
40.</hi> and sometimes, <hi>Zaniph,</hi> Zech. 3.
5. which are rendred by the <hi>Seventy</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and by Our Translators <hi>bonnets</hi>
and <hi>mitres.</hi> After several disputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the nature of this Covering, it is not
to be doubted that it was a kind of <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant,</hi>
which I gather from <hi>Ex.</hi> 39. 28.
where 'tis expressly said that it was made
of <hi>fine linnen,</hi> and from <hi>Ex. 29. 9. &amp;
Lev.</hi> 8. 13. where 'tis said it was
<hi>bound upon</hi> their heads. Besides, the
verb <hi>Zanaph, circumvolvere, circumli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare,</hi>
whence <hi>Zamph</hi> comes, shews that
this was a Cove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing that was rolled and
tied about the head. And as for the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:99329:66"/>
rest of the people, they continually wore
something on their heads, a sort of <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi>
or <hi>Hood,</hi> or <hi>Cap,</hi> (for it is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
represented.) Or you may call it
a <hi>Hat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and such perhaps were those <hi>Hats</hi>
which the three young men were bound
in when they were thrown into the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fiery furnace, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 21. So our
Translators render the word there,
though the invention of <hi>Hats</hi> (such as
we have at this day) was since the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> reign. It is
most probable that this was a sort of <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bants,</hi>
and that the <hi>Iews</hi> generally wore
this sort of Covering on their heads,
though it was not so rich and costly as
that which the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Great Men</hi>
wore. Whatsoever this Covering was,
it was so close to their heads that it
could not be presently pull'd off with
ease, and so it was not a custom to shew
Respect to their Superiours or equals
when they met them by pulling off this
attire. For this cause it was no sign
of Reverence either in their Synagogues
or any where else to be Bare-headed.
They had another way of shewing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
and Respect to God and men,
<hi>viz.</hi> by Bowing; which prevailed with
all other Oriental people gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:99329:67"/>
They shew'd also their Respect and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beisance
by baring their feet. Hence
<hi>Moses put off his shoes:</hi> instead of <hi>Vnco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
his head,</hi> he did so to his <hi>feet.</hi>
And perhaps <hi>Solomon</hi> alludes to this
Eastern mode in <hi>Ecol. 5. 1. Keep thy
foot when thou goest to the house of God,</hi>
i. e. shew all signs of <hi>Reverence</hi> in that
place. The <hi>Persians</hi> likewise were of
the number of those who used not to
uncover their heads either in Civil or
Religious conversation. And the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans</hi>
to this day (for I may bring
them in here because they are successors
of the Antient Eastern people in those
Countries,) these (I say,) as well as
the <hi>Persians,</hi> wearing <hi>Turbants</hi> (which
are not so easily put off) have their
heads constantly covered with them:
they never put them off to the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Men or Princes. And being not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
to Men, they will not be so to
God. They perform their Religious
Worship with their Turbants on their
heads: only we are told that when they
go to Prayers they touch them with the
tops of their fingers, in token, some think,
of taking them off. So much of the
practice of the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>other Eastern
Nations.</hi>

               </gap> us see what the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
did. The <hi>Old Greeks</hi> had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
practice, they used no Covering
on their heads, being an Hale and Stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
people, and not willing to use them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
tenderly. Besides, they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured
to sharp enterprizes and services in
the Wars, wherein they found it most
proper to come on <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which
hath been since used in a <hi>Proverbial</hi> way
for Bold and Manly Adventures. But
those that came after them were not so
disposed; for <hi>Thucydides, Strabo,</hi> and <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lux</hi>
acquaint us that the <hi>Spartans</hi> wore
<hi>woollen caps</hi> or <hi>hats,</hi> and that the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots</hi>
their servants had <hi>dog-skin hats:</hi> nor
was it a frequent custom to vail these
hats or bonnets in way of Salutation.
And if you ask what was the usage at
their <hi>Worship, Macrobius</hi> and <hi>Plutarch,</hi>
two sufficient witnesses, assure you they
Uncovered their heads in Divine Offices.
It was their opinion it seems that the
Gods were not to be addressed after the
manner of Men: and therefore though
many of them in ordinary and common
converse covered their heads, yet they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
in another posture at their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Devotions. Besides, the Temples
or Places consecrated to the Gods were
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:99329:68"/>
heretofore Open without any roof or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering:
which the Old hardy <hi>Greeks</hi>
seemed to emulate, and would needs wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with bare heads. But the practice
of the <hi>Romans,</hi> as it is best known, so
it is most observable. It is certain that
the <hi>Old Romans</hi> used no Covering on
their heads. Whilest they were Hard
and Strong, and before they were grown
Effeminate it was usual with them to go
Bare. Clothing arrived to what it was
afterwards by degrees both for the head
and other parts. But at first when they
were not so tender and delicate, their
very Kings and Princes, and after that,
their Consuls and Greatest Officers used
to go bare-headed. Yea,<note n="i" place="margin">
                  <hi>Sueton. in</hi> Jul. Caes.</note> 
               <hi>Iul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

reckon'd it the Greatest favour and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
that could be done him by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that they bestow'd upon him a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel-Crown
to hide his bald head. But
though it was the usual Custom of the
<hi>Romans</hi> to go with their heads Uncove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
yet this practice of theirs had these
following Exceptions, (as you may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from those who have writ of the
<hi>Roman Customs,</hi> and particularly from
<hi>Plutarch</hi> in his <hi>Quaest. Roman. &amp; Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius
de Amphitheatro,</hi> Cap. 19. as also
from <hi>Varro, Tully, Martial, Plautus,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:99329:68"/>
Suetonius, Ovid, Horace, Salust, Seneca,</hi>
with whose <hi>Names only</hi> I trouble the
Reader here, that I may save him the
trouble afterwards of consulting their
<hi>words</hi> at length in the margin.) 1. At
their <hi>Plays</hi> they were Covered. Those
Sports being indulged them out of Good
Will and Favour, they took the liberty
at that time to sit with their caps or
hats on. 2. When they <hi>Travelled</hi> their
heads were covered against the injury of
the weather. Although generally when
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hey went abroad they were bare-headed,
yet in considerable Journeys, when they
were to be a good while out, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in Voyages at sea, they took their
caps with them. 3. In the <hi>Wars</hi> they
most frequently wore these caps or hats.
It is true <hi>Statues</hi> and <hi>Medalls</hi> present
their Commanders and Souldiers bare-headed:
but so they do our Kings of
<hi>England,</hi> and generally all others. We
must not therefore infer thence that
These never wear hats or any other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
on their heads. 4. The <hi>Aged peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
wore something on their heads when
their hair was fallen of. 5. So did they
that were <hi>Sick,</hi> and very much indisposed
by infirmity of body. 6. Some add,
that when the Weather required it, as
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:99329:69"/>
in Rain, Snow, Hail, great Winds, or
when the Sun beat on them extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily,
they took part of their Gown,
and clapt it on their heads: but that was
no formal Covering. So 7<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, when they
<hi>Mourned,</hi> they covered their heads. 8<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>,
It is well known that the <hi>Romans</hi> when
they were <hi>made Free,</hi> had a Hat or Cap
put on their heads: for this was a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol
or Emblem of Liberty among them.
But though this Cap was given to them
that were Manumitted, yet I do not read
that they made any use of it; some of
them never wore it afterwards. Lastly,
The <hi>Romans</hi> (as it is obvious to observe
of them; in which likewise they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the <hi>Grecians</hi>) used one sort of
Custom in their <hi>Civil,</hi> another in their
<hi>Sacred</hi> affairs, and accordingly when
they were interessed and employ'd about
Religious Worship, they were not Bare-headed
but Covered. And yet though
they generally worshipp'd their Gods
with Veild heads, I know not how it
came to pass, but so it was, they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipp'd
<hi>Saturn</hi> with heads Uncovered,
But excepting this one Instance, it is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
agreed that the <hi>Romans,</hi> when
they were at Religious Exercises, were
Covered, both Priests and People, the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:99329:69"/>
former with their bonnets, caps or hats,
the latter with some part of their clothes
thrown over their heads. This is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
of them by <hi>Plutarch</hi> (who at
the same time takes notice of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
practice of the <hi>Greeks,</hi>) and he
gives This Reason why they covered
their heads when they Worship'd the
Gods, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <note n="k" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Quaest. Rom.</note> because by so doing they
gave a testimony of their Humility and
Submission to the Gods. So <hi>Servius</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
from a place in <hi>Virgils</hi> third <hi>Aeneid,</hi>
that the <hi>Italians</hi> covered their heads in
time of Worship, of Sacrificing espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially.
Nothing is more acknowledg'd
by the Learned then that the <hi>Romans</hi>
cover'd their heads in their Temples, and
at their Religious Service, as the <hi>Iews</hi>
did; whom they imitated also in Veil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves in time of <hi>Mourning.</hi>
And from the custom of having their
heads covered when they <hi>Worship'd</hi> and
when they <hi>Mourned,</hi> we may infer that
they used the Contrary practice at other
times, and consequently that they went
with Bare-heads. Here I might remark
that (contrary to the custom of the
<hi>Iews</hi> and all <hi>Eastern</hi> people) Unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
the head to Magistrates and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors
as they passed by was used by
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:99329:70"/>
the <hi>Antient Romans</hi> as a token of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
and Honour. This was an usage
for a time, as <hi>Varro</hi> and <hi>Plautarch</hi> testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie:
but afterwards, and in our <hi>Apostle's</hi>
time tis most likely, that custom was
laid aside, and it was not a sign of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
but of Manhood and Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to bare the head. The Better sort
of them, the Richest and most Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
persons appear'd in this posture.
Though after this <hi>Another Custom</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd,
and in a short time <hi>Vncovering
the head</hi> became a sign of Respect and
Reverence among the <hi>Romans,</hi> and all
Western and Northern people. To pass
then to the customs of <hi>Other Nations;</hi>
the <hi>Old Germans</hi> and <hi>Gauls</hi> used no Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
on their heads, and therefore you
cannot expect any such thing in their
Worship. As to the <hi>Americans</hi> lately
discovered, the History of those places
tells us that generally they being strong
and lusty use not themselves to any Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
on their heads, as they have but
little, and sometimes none on their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
Particularly <hi>Purchas</hi> saith of the
people of <hi>Brasil</hi> that they all goe Bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed,
and their heads are as hard as
blocks. This being their custom, no
wonder that these Blockheads are Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:99329:70"/>
likewise before their Gods or Idols.</p>
            <p>This is a short Account of the usage
of <hi>Covering the head,</hi> especially in time
of Worshipping. Now to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>Paul</hi> did not borrow this
custom, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the mens <hi>praying with the head

for we have proved that in their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
they covered their heads. Whence
then was this custom among the Order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Christians of Corinth,</hi> and how came
the Apostle to urge id<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>as a Decent and
Reverent Observance? I answer, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi>
writing to the <hi>Grecians</hi> (for so the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi>
were) follow'd the <hi>Grecian</hi>
custom, among whom it was usual to be
Bare-headed and Divine Worship. And
though the <hi>Romans</hi> were Covered at
the service of their Gods, yet at other
times they generally were Uncovered.
To go with the head bare was so far
from being a badg of Inferiority and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
that it was rather a token of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:99329:71"/>
and Superiority, and was accordingly
used by persons of the greatest Quality
among them. And we are sure that <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
the head</hi> in some cases was a
sign of Submission and Shame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and what
was worse: else <hi>caput ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as he himself is pleased to say, thought
fit to make use both of the <hi>Grecian</hi> and
<hi>Roman</hi> customs, <hi>viz.</hi> the practice of the

was the <hi>mens Vncovering their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and the usage of the latter in their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary

the same, and might now not seem un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable
to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> since the

               </hi>
of that people were grown common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as interchangeably the

were in good repute among the <hi>Romans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> therefore is pleased to introduce
and adopt this custom into the <hi>Christian
Church,</hi> and to enjoyn the Converts and
Believers of <hi>Corinth</hi> to make use of this
in their Divine Worship and Service of
God. It is not to be doubted that this
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:99329:71"/>
practice which the Apostle here urgeth
is founded even on a Civil Custom which
obtain'd at that time among the persons
the Apostle writ to. For the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Order and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated
and conformed to the Civil
Usages of a Place, if they have nothing
of evil in them. Particularly in Prayer
and Divine Service this may be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
The Civil posture used in sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating
Kings and Great ones is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
used in Religious supplication of
God. By the same Gesture and Habit
wherewith we testifie our Respect to
Men we may express our Reverence to
God. All the Cristians of <hi>Europe</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
do so. Which by the by gives
us the true Account why the Rites and
Observances of several Churches vary
from one another. The reason is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Civil Customs</hi> vary in several Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries:
accordingly <hi>Ecclesiastical Rites</hi> do
so too. But observe here that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
who takes this Particular Custom
used in Common and Civil conversation,
and transfers it to a Religious use, yet
would not let the other Custom, <hi>viz.</hi>
of <hi>Covering the head,</hi> which so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
prevail'd in the <hi>Roman</hi> and
<hi>Iewish Worship</hi> be made use of in the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:99329:72"/>
               <hi>Christian one.</hi> For it is reasonable to
think that the Apostle here rebukes the
Custom of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> about <hi>the
Mens being Covered,</hi> because it was bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
from the <hi>Roman Idolaters</hi> and
from the <hi>Iews.</hi> The <hi>Corinthian</hi> Church
used the like in their Solemn Assemblies,
and therefore they are justly reprehended
because they conformed to a Custom
which was so General and Prevalent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
those Superstitious Worshippers,
who were then Cover'd and Veild at
their devotions. First, He would not have
them cloud their heads at their Service
as the <hi>Gentiles</hi> did at the worship of
their Idols. It hath been intimated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that the Servile Fear of their Gods
made those worshippers Veil and hide
their heads: but the <hi>Apostle</hi> would have
the Worship of <hi>Christians</hi> to be Free
and Ingenuous, and void of that slavish
Fear and Dread. Besides, this would
be an imitating of the <hi>Iews,</hi> who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Prescription and Order from God
wrapt up their heads in Veils when they
were at their Publick Worship. The
Apostle would by no means allow the
<hi>Christians</hi> to follow this practice of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with their faces covered, it being so
great a piece of Jewish Superstition. He
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:99329:72"/>
would not suffer them to ape the <hi>Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi>
people in this kind of Hood-wink'd
Devotion. For These Reasons and for
<hi>Others</hi> suggested in this Chapter, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi>'s
will is that the <hi>Corinthian Men,</hi>
who were Converts and Saints, should
be <hi>Bare-headed</hi> in their Religious Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
And from S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> all Christians
generally have received and practised this
Usage, though not upon the very same
grounds and reasons for which he urged
this practice. For the Christian Churches
at this day conform to this usage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
among them generally the Token
of Respect or Reverence to Men is Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
the head, and therefore they
observe This also in their Addresses to
God, and express their Adoration and
Worship by having no Covering on their
heads. And herein they follow the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
himself, who (as I have suggested)
made choice of the Civil usage of the
<hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> and brought it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church.</p>
            <p>Hitherto I have spoken only of <hi>the
Covering</hi> or <hi>Vncovering used by Men.</hi>
In the next place, Because the Apostle
adds, <hi>Every woman that prayeth or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesieth
with her head uncovered disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
her head,</hi> I must adjoyn a few words
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:99329:73"/>
concerning the Injunction which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in these words, <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> that the
<hi>Christian Women</hi> were to cover and veil
their heads when ever they were emploi'd

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Worship. The Covering
or Veiling the head among that Sex is
no New thing. It was an antient custom
to bring the wife to the husband co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with <hi>a Veil,</hi> as we expressly read
of <hi>Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it was that <hi>Iacob</hi> was baguiled by <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s that he that joyned the man
and woman in marriage used to <hi>Cover the
head</hi> of the bride with the end of the
linnen which hung down from the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grooms
neck. To which they say <hi>Ruth</hi>

her,</hi> Ruth 3. 9. And hence <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage</hi>
it self is call'd <hi>Chuppah,</hi> from <hi>Chip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pah,</hi>
to cover. The <hi>Iewish</hi> women ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
after they were married used a
<hi>Veil;</hi> they went covered with this into
the Temple and Synagog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es, and they
wore it wherever they appear'd pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly.
As for the women among the
<hi>Romans,</hi> it is well Known that <hi>Nubere,</hi>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:99329:73"/>
which is the proper word for their <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying,</hi>
is as much as <hi>Obnubere,</hi> because
she <hi>clouded</hi> or <hi>covered</hi> her head: for those
that are acquainted with the <hi>Romans</hi> Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
know that the Bride was brought
home covered with a Veil. To this our
<hi>English</hi> or rather <hi>Norman</hi> Laws may
allude perhaps, which call a Married
Woman a <hi>femme</hi> covert, and by it
they understand the Womans being <hi>sub
potest a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e viri</hi> (as they speak,) under
the power of her husband. A woman,
when she marries, puts her self into a
state of <hi>Subjection,</hi> and this without
doubt was signified heretofore by the
<hi>Veiling</hi> her. Thus it was among the
<hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> and thus it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Grecians</hi> (who imitated the
<hi>Romans,</hi> as I said before, in many things,)
at least it was thus among the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>
whom the Apostle wrote to; the
Women went <hi>Veiled</hi> to shew their Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
and Subjection. And indeed this
custom remains still not only among the
<hi>Turks</hi> but most <hi>Eastern</hi> Countries, Yea
in most parts of the world. This Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
then of the Apostle (as the other

               </gap>ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

among Women at that time (not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding)
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:99329:74"/>
the Other Reasons assigned by
the Apostle in this Chapter on which he
grounds this practice.) All modest and
honest Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rons, Wives, and even Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
wore certain <hi>Veils:</hi> or <hi>Coverings</hi> on
<hi>their heads,</hi> and they never used to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ear
publickly without them. And the
Apostle liked this Custom so well that
he would have it obtain in the <hi>Worship
of God.</hi> The Modesty which women
shew at Other times must much more
be expressed in the Sacred Assemblies.
If they go with Veiled heads in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places, certainly it is unfi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Women was foretold by the Prophet

                  </gap>, 2. ch. 28. v.</hi> and we read some
Instances of it in <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 9. Some of
these <hi>Prophesying Women</hi> were in the
Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and being extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily

Donation of those first times of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel)
they <hi>Pray'd</hi> and <hi>Preach'd</hi> publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(which latter especially was a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Office,) and they proceeded to usurp
on the Custom which was proper to the
<hi>Men, i. e. they Vncovered their heads,</hi>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:99329:74"/>
and would needs have their Faces seen
as well as their Voices heard. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
soon took notice of this bold dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
and here enjoyns them (together
with all other women) a modest <hi>Veil,</hi>
or rather he doth but bid them practice
the known Custom used by that Sex.
This Injunction without doubt was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve'd
by all the Faithfull women; and
we may inform our selves from Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
History that it was derived to
After ages, and practised a long time by
that Sex. It came down as far as the
Emperour <hi>Decius</hi>'s time, by the same to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
that he put out a Decree that the
Christian women at <hi>Rome</hi> should leave
off wearing the <hi>Veil</hi> on their heads,
hoping that by that Immodest usage
they might be brought at last to Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism
and Idolatry. But his design did
not take of perverting their minds and
bringing them to comply with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n
Worship, though they laid aside their
<hi>Veils</hi> and went Bare-headed, for which
they gave This Reason,<note n="m" place="margin">

But soon after (if not about the same
time) the <hi>Veil</hi> was thrown off, not
by force of Persecutors but of Choise
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:99329:75"/>
for which that Sex is smartly reprehe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in his piece <hi>de Velan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis
Virginibus:</hi> where his main indeavour
is to prove that Virgins as well as Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
Women were to be Veild in the
Religious Assemblies, and that it was S
<hi>Paul</hi>'s meaning in this Chapter. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he reproves the manners of the
Women and Maids who came into the
Congregations Uncovered and in their
Hair, as a direct breach of the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Canon. And certainly so it was,
for that which the Apostle delivers in
this Chapter concerning Womens beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
in the Churches did not only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
the Women of that time, but is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory
to this very day. All Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
women are ingaged by vertue of
what the Apostle here saith, to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
with their heads covered in time
of Prayer and other Religious Exercises.
The Women among the <hi>Iews</hi> and the
<hi>Turks</hi> meet apart from the Men when
they pray in publick: the Women (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their custom) are shut up by
themselves. But this is a kind of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating
them, and therefore is
not allowable: wherefore let the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
Injunction take place, that is,
let them not appear with their heads
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:99329:75"/>
Uncovered all the time they are at Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Worship. At other times and in
other places, especially at home and in
their own families, <hi>Christian women,</hi> and
more especially <hi>English women,</hi> may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
shew themselves without a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
on their heads (unless it be that
which the Apostle saith was <hi>given them
for a Covering,)</hi> that it may appear they
are not of the number of those women
who are servilely used, as it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they are obliged to express whiles they

to <hi>Man</hi> yet in reverence to <hi>Angels,</hi>
those Heavenly and Divine Spirits who
are present in the Publick Assemblies
(as even the Heathen Moralists have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,)
and are Overseers and Witnesses
of the behaviour of Women as well
as of Men in the Church. I know there
are Other Glosses on these words: some
with <hi>Beza</hi> understand by the <hi>Angels</hi> the
Ministers and Governours of the Church,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:99329:76"/>
the Prophets that Prophesied in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
and they think that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi>
exhorts the Women to be veiled, that
they might not by exposing their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
be an occasion of diverting those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
from their serious employment. Our
Great English Rabbi fancies that by the
<hi>Angels</hi> are meant the Messengers or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
of Espousals, and that women had
the liberty of unveiling or veiling their
faces upon their account. But that
which may confute this opinion is this
(not to speak of the unusual acception
of the word <hi>Angles</hi>) that the Apostle
in this Chapter speaks of the Sex in
general, but especially of Married Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
whereas this Author restrains the
Apostles words to the Unmarried only.
This Worthy Man hath another inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
of a far different nature, which
is this, that <hi>Evil Angels</hi> or <hi>Devils</hi> are
to be understood here, and that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle's
meaning is (to deliver it in this
Authors own words) that<note n="o" place="margin">Harmony of the N. Test.</note> 
               <hi>women must
not expose their faces in the publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
lest the Devil make a bait of
their beauty, and thereby int angle the hearts
and eyes of the men.</hi> Lastly, I could
offer a conjecture of my own, <hi>viz.</hi> that
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is a mistake of the

of the flocks,</hi> i. e. the Congregations
or Assemblies of Christians, which are
called <hi>flocks, Mat. 26. 31. Acts 20. 28.
1 Pet.</hi> 5. 2, 3. (although the same
Greek word he not used in these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.)
The plain sense then is that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
ought not to appear with uncovered
heads, but to behave themselves with
singular modesty and humility, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Solemn Employment which they
are about. They are met together to
worship God, they are come into the
Assemblies of the Faithfull for no other
end, therefore let them not dare to shew
themselves Immodest and Irreverent, let
them have a Veil on their heads <hi>because
of the flock of Christ:</hi> let them avoid
all lightness and vanity, and set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with the utmost seriousness to that
Divine VVork which they are gathered
together for, and let them in this be <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samples
to the flock.</hi> But if you will not
admit of any alteration in the <hi>Greek Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,</hi>
(which I am not very forward to
urge) then in my judgement the first
Interpretation which I named seems to
be the most genuine. When the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
enjoyns the women to cover their
heads <hi>because of the Angels,</hi> he proceeds
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:99329:77"/>
upon the received opinion of the Jews,
that Angels are always present in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Meetings, and indeed in all Great
and Weighty Consultations. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he suggests the Reasonableness of
womens modest behaviour in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
because of these Angels. As
if the Apostle had said, If Men be
dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>egarded by you, yet have respect
to these Invisible Overseers and Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
who take notice of your loose and
disordely carriage, and will one day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
it to your disadvantage. This
Reason is perpetual.</p>
            <p>And thus I have finished the Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of these words. The summ is
this, That the Apostle is desirous those
Christians at <hi>Corinth,</hi> who had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
by his Ministry, should <hi>walk or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly</hi>
and <hi>as became</hi> the professors of
the Gospel. Wherefore he blames the
Men for Covering their heads, and the
Women for laying aside their Veils in
time of Religious Worship; and again
he chides both Sexes for another Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
<hi>viz.</hi> that the Men wore their
Hair like Women, and that These
appeared in the guise of Men as to
their Hair. He lets them know that
both these kinds of Disorders are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:99329:78"/>
to the Institution of God and
the Dictates of Reason. But especially
the latter of these practises is con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uted
here by an <hi>Appeal to Nature,</hi> which is
a <hi>Comprehensive Topick,</hi> and you may
understand by it the General dictate of
Natural Reason, and the Particular
Law of Nature concerning Distinction
of Sexes, as also Usage and Custom
which is a Second Nature. According
to the direction of these the Apostle
would have them walk, suggesting that
not only the <hi>Length</hi> but the <hi>Adorning
of the hair</hi> are Uncomely and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corous,
and therefore Unnatural in
the Manly Sex, but are Comely and
Decent, yea even Proper and Natural
in the other. In a word, a Man must
not be like a Woman either as to her
<hi>Veil</hi> and <hi>Covering</hi> or as to her <hi>Long</hi>
and <hi>Dressed Hair,</hi> because he is taught
otherwise by the Law of <hi>Reason,</hi> and
by that of the <hi>Sex,</hi> and even by the
<hi>Practice and Custom</hi> of the soberest
part of the world, which are all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised
in the large extent of the word
<hi>Nature</hi> in this place of the Apostle.</p>

free and Impartial Animadversion on
them, and then to take the boldness to
offer my Own thoughts in the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:99329:79"/>
which I purpose to do (as I ought)
with a strict Veneration of Antiquity
and the Primitive Writers of the Church,
with a faithful regard to the Masters
of Grammer and Criticism, with a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the Whole Context, and to the
Analogy of Christian faith. I think it
will not be amiss in the first place to
rank the Expositors on This place after
This Method. They understand it of
<hi>Baptism</hi> either <hi>Properly</hi> or <hi>Improperly</hi>
taken: 1. <hi>Properly,</hi> for a Real and
Outward Washing with water. 2. <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly</hi>
or Metaphorically, for the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
of Afflction and Suffering, as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the word is understood. But the
<hi>Proper Baptizing</hi> or Washing will ingage
me most of all in This Discourse, and That
is threefold, 1. <hi>Sacramental,</hi> which is no
other then that Holy Ordinance of Christs
institution, whereby children or those of
riper years are admitted into the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church by the action of outward
Washing or Sprinkling with water. 2.
<hi>Funeral Washing,</hi> which was practised in
order to the burying of the dead bodies.
3. <hi>Legal or Ceremonial washing,</hi> used by
the <hi>Iews</hi> as often as they were defiled
by touching the dead: and this was done
either in their own persons, or by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:99329:80"/>
for them in case they died before
they were Cleansed.</p>
            <p>I. Begin we with the Various Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations
of Those on the place who
understand it of <hi>Sacramental Baptizing.</hi>
And first, there are some who inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
it of Those who <hi>at their Baptism</hi>
profess themselves <hi>dead to sin and to the
world:</hi> and by this Baptismal act they
are reputed to be thus <hi>Spiritually dead.</hi> A
second Opinion is of those who imagine
the words spoken of <hi>Baptism</hi> as <hi>it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenteth
the Bodily Death.</hi> Others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it of <hi>Baptism</hi> as it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with the confession of the
Article of the <hi>Resurrection of the dead;</hi>
A fourth sort say it is spoken of the
<hi>Clinicks,</hi> those who lay on their sick
beds, and receive the Sacrament of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.</hi>
Fifthly, others understand it of
<hi>Baptizing over the dead,</hi> over the Tombs
of the Deceased Martyrs. Sixthly, there
are some who think it is meant of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
in the place and stead of the dead.</hi>
Seventhly, there is a Learned man who
thinks it is spoken of an <hi>Annual Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
for the benefit of the dead.</hi> Eightly,
Another conceveth in refers to <hi>Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
with the imposition of the names of
the dead.</hi> Lastly, there is a Learned
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:99329:80"/>
Critick who dissents from all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
Opinions, and is perswaded that
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is put here for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
the Plural for the Singular: but
how he applies it you shall hear after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>1. I begin with the First, the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of those who imagine These words
are spoken of <hi>Baptized Christians,</hi> who
by this very Sacrament professed to the
world that they were <hi>Spiritually dead.</hi>
So that <hi>to be baptized for the dead</hi> is as
much as <hi>to be reputed as dead persons
when they were baptized,</hi> or, <hi>at their bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
to be like dead men,</hi> viz. Dead in
respect of Sin and any Love to it. At
that Solemn Initiating themselves into
the Church they openly renounced their
former sins, they publickly disowned their
past vices, they became Mortified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and betook themselves to a Severe
and Strict course of life: thus (Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
and Spiritually speaking) they were
Dead. So the words are interpreted by
some<note n="b" place="margin">S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Ierom, Chrysostom, Theodoret, Primasius, Sedulius.</note> Antient Fathers: with whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
a few of the<note n="c" place="margin">Melanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Cajetan, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> Moderns, amongst
whom a<note n="d" place="margin">Philip. <hi>à Limborch Theolog. Christian. l. 6. c.</hi> 10.</note> Late Writer expresses his
sense thus, <q>Baptized for the dead
are they who when they are baptized
declare that they are ready to Die to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:99329:81"/>
the world, to be in it as Dead men,
and to live a new life: and if occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
be, to submit to the Cross, and
Die for their Religion. This they do
that they may have a blessed Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</q>
But This Interpretation will be
far from gaining our consent if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
(besides what I shall add under the
next Opinion) but these two things:
First, there is no reason to interpret these
<hi>baptized for the dead,</hi> of those that are
<hi>spiritually dead,</hi> because it is generally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
by all Sober Interpreters of Scr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that we should not flie to an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
and Metaphorical sense when the
Literal and Proper one will serve our turn.
But I shall afterwards prove that a Plain
and Literal meaning of these words is
most probable and reasonable. Secondly,
the Context it self will con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ute this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation,
for if the Spiritual Death be
here mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, i. e. <hi>the being buried with
Christ in baptism,</hi> and being dead to sin
and the world, then who will think there
is any <hi>Consequence</hi> in the Apostles Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning,
whil'st he argueth from a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
and Mystical Death and Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
(of which <hi>Baptism</hi> is a Sign)
unto that which is Bodily and External,
which is the subject he here treats of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:99329:81"/>
through out the whole Chapter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The
Inference is so Foreign that I cannot see
how it will ever be admitted.</p>
            <p>2. Others are of the opinion, that
These words are spoken of <hi>Baptism as
it represents the Bodily Death.</hi> And some
of the Fathers who were Pat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ons of the
First Interpretation were pleased also to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>spouse this Second: for they thought fit
to joyn both these together, <hi>viz.</hi> the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
and the Bodily Death, asserting that
the <hi>Representation</hi> or <hi>Resemblance of both</hi>
was intended here by the Apost<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e. Now
let us see how they apply these words
to the Death of the Body. They hold
that the Apostle's Argument in the Text
is of this sort, If there shall be no <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the dead</hi> hereafter, why is <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi>
so significant a Symbol of our Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and Rising again, and also of the
Death and Resurrection of Christ <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For
those that were Proselytes to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

plunged into the Baptismal water,
and in being there Overwhelmed and <hi>bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried</hi>
as it were in the Consecrated Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The Immersion into the water
was thought to signifie the Death of
Christ, and their Coming out denoted
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:99329:82"/>
his Rising again, and did no less repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
their Own future Resurrection. On
which account the Minister's putting in
of the Christian Converts into the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred

thence, are stiled by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

first of Christ's<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then of Their
Resurrection from the grave, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Fathers have been induced to
believe that This passage of our Apostle
which I am speaking of hath a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
respect to That, and is to be Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
by it. Nay, this seems to agree
exactly with the language and tenour of
our Apostle himself, who may be thought
to be the Best Interpreter of his own
words. <hi>Know ye not,</hi> saith he, <hi>that so
many of us as were baptized into Christ
were baptized into his death? therefore
we are buried with him by baptism into
death, that like as Christ was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

much as <hi>like the dead,</hi> or, <hi>in resemblance

Exposition of the words can look
for our Assent and Suffrage. Let it be
proved that <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> is as much as <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>
i. e. that it is a word of <hi>Similitude,</hi> and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies

               </gap>, which is used in Comparing and
Likening one thing with another. Till
then it cannot be credited, that <hi>for the
dead,</hi> signifies a <hi>Resemblance or Likeness
to those that are dead.</hi> I grant that <hi>Pro</hi>
in <hi>Latin</hi> is sometimes as much as <hi>quasi,
perinde, instar;</hi> as when we read in <hi>Tully,
pro nihilo putare vel ducere,</hi> to esteem <hi>as</hi>
nothing: and (to come nearer to the
present matter) when the same Author
saith, <hi>pro occiso relictus est,</hi> he was left
<hi>as</hi> dead. So <hi>pro mortuis</hi> may be applied
in a sentence to signifie as much as <hi>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam

Own Vulgar way of speaking, <hi>for dead</hi>
denotes as much as <hi>dead,</hi> or <hi>as dead:</hi>
thus we say, such a one lay <hi>for dead,</hi> or
was taken up <hi>for dead.</hi> But I never
heard that it was thus in the Greek
Tongue, and therefore I am very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oth to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:99329:83"/>
charge our Apostle here (as <hi>Erasmus</hi> and
<hi>Calvin</hi> do in other places) with false
Greek. I grant that the <hi>Actions in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi>
(especially as it was administred of
old) were Representative of the Death
and Resurrection both of Christ and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers:
but that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Pauls</hi> words here
have reference to any such thing, the
Propriety of Phrase (as you have heard)
will not permit us to believe. Besides,
you may observe (as you shall have far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
occasion hereafter to take notice)
it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> with a Praepositive
Article, which utterly spoils that sense
which is pretended: for the Apostle
speaks here Definitively, and not at
large: and the words are rightly rendred
[<hi>for the dead</hi>] not [<hi>for dead.</hi>]</p>
            <p>3. The next interpretation is that of
S<hi rend="sup">s</hi> 
               <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> (for you must know it is
usual with Him to adjoyn one Opinion to
another, as <hi>here</hi> he thinks fit to add This
which I am now mentioning, to those other
two which I nam'd before) and he is follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Theophylact</hi> and <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

consequently <hi>in hope of that Resurrection.</hi>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:99329:84"/>
So that the Apostle here is thought by
them to refer to the Form of Confession
of Faith, or Reciting the Articles of the
Greed, in which among other things the
person to be baptized openly professed
his belief of That Article of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the dead. And the Great
Canonists, <hi>Balsamon</hi> and <hi>Zonaras,</hi> refer the

acknowledged that soon after the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle's
time, a Publick Profession of the
Creed was required of those that presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
themselves to be Baptized, yet it
remains to be proved that in the Time
wherein our Apostle lived they solemnly
Recited a Form of Belief at Baptism,
and that they had This very Confession
of Faith which now goes under the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
Names. This is Doubtful at least,
and so we ought not to be Definitive and
Peremptory about it, and therefore we
cannot be sure that the Apostle argues
in this place from any such practice as
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:99329:84"/>
the Rehearsal of the Creed. 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, Grant
that this Form of Confession was used
at Baptism by the <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> and that
all the Articles of it were openly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed,
and consequently, in the Close
that of the Resurrection of the dead: yet
then it should rather have been said,
<hi>What shall they do that are baptized for
those that are Risen from the dead,</hi> not
barely, <hi>for the dead?</hi> Nay 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, who sees
not yet farther a Greater Impropriety
and Harshness in the Apostle's way of
speaking, if <hi>to be baptized for the dead</hi>
must be interpreted thus, <hi>to be baptized
in hope of the resurrection of the dead?</hi>
First, [<hi>the dead</hi>] is put here for <hi>the
dead bodies</hi> of the deceased, for These
only can be said to <hi>rise</hi> at the last day.
And therefore it is S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Chrysostoms</hi> Gloss on
the words,<note n="h" place="margin">

of the dead bodies.</hi> This is too Concise
a way of speaking: wherefore I yield to
our Judicious <hi>Thorndyke,</hi> who descanting
on this passage, concludes it cannot be
justified by any Example, that <gap reason="foreign">

was an utter Despair of their Living till

               </gap>,
as they lay in their Beds: and
from that usage of theirs the <hi>Clinici</hi> or
Bed-ridden took their Name. For you
must know that it was usuall with those
that were converted to Christianity to
defer their Baptism. Perhaps (say some)
at first it proceeded from fear and cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize,
which made them unwilling to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
themselves by the open profession
of their Religion, and so they put off
their admission into the Church as long
as they could; but when they were ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested
by Grievous Sickness, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to their Beds, they passionately beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to be baptized before they left the
world. This was one sort of <hi>Clinicks.</hi>
But there was a second sert who deferred
their Baptism on other accounts: These
were no New Converts, but such as had
imbraced Christianity a considerable time;
yet they purposely deferred their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
on one pretended ground or other.

are Different, yea Contrary Reasons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
for this practise: some did pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
put off their Baptism till death
approached, that they might be the more
at liberty to indulge their follies and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
for when one of the <hi>Catechumeni</hi>
Committed a fault, they used to excuse
his failing by alledging This in his favour,
that he was not yet Baptized. They
did it also that they might not sin after
the celebrating the Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
for S <hi>Cyprian</hi> tells us they had
This fond and groundless notion, that
there was no Pardon for those that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapsed
into sin after Baptisme. This a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose
from the mistaking of That place,
Heb. 6. 4, 5. which the <hi>Novatians</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
warmly insisted upon, and would by
no means Absolve those that lapsed after
Baptism. But the Orthodox Fathers
were of another mind, and sharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
this custom of deferring Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.

of This Abuse in the Church, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd

into a Custom to omit the receiving of
Baptism as long as they were in health
(and perhaps the Example of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
and his son <hi>Constantius</hi> who did so
gave some repute to this evil usage,)
but as soon as they fell sick they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
themselves of their duty, and
when they perceived the Malady grew
desperate, and themselves irrecoverable,
then they sent presently for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Priests, and solemnly gave up their
Names to Christ in Holy Baptism, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
desirous to carry out of the world

<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Moribundi,</hi> who lay on their
Death-Beds, and called for Speedy Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
some interpret the words of the Text.
But that they have but little reason, I
shall prove from these following Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.
1. It is not probable that that
sort of <hi>Clinicks</hi> who were newly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
from Paganism is here meant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in those <hi>first days</hi> Fear and Faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartedness
did not possess men, as they
are known to have done afterwards. A
singular Zeal and Ardency inspired their
minds, and they were not ashamed to
own and publickly maintain the Faith
they had espoused: yea, they gloried in
their sufferings for the Cause of Christ,
and rejoyced in their persecutions for it,
as the <hi>Acts of the Apostles</hi> assure us. It
is not likely therefore that These de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
their being baptized on the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
account, and consequently it is
not likely that the Text speaks of these.
2. It is not certain that it was the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of the Christians in the <hi>Apostles</hi>
days, that Sin after Baptism is Irremis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
which was another ground of the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:99329:89"/>
Custom of deferring Baptism. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
it is to be said, and that with
evident Truth, that it doth not appear
in the least that the foremention'd Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
of the believers requesting baptism
in the very close of their lives prevail'd
in the times of the <hi>Apostles:</hi> but it seems
rather to have crept in after those first
Guides of the Church were gone; and
therefore that Glosse on the words can
have but a slender foundation. Or 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, say
that such an Use obtained even in the
Apostles days, yet will not S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Pauls</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
have any force at all by rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
unto That<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For thus it must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
What shall the baptized <hi>Clinicks</hi>
do if the dead rise not at all? why are
they also baptized just at the point of
death? why have they that Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
given to them at the last gasp?
if there be no Rising again, why do they
thus? It may be answer'd, that though
there should be no Resurrection of the
dead, yet it follows not that they were
Baptised in vain, for that Sacred Office
of Baptism was thought in that case
(and that rightly too) chiefly to have
respect to what was Past. Though the
dead bodies rise not, yet that Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was useful to the Soul, and available
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:99329:89"/>
to the Absolution and Remission of their
sins: which plainly appears from the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of deferring baptism heretofore, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
left they should sin, and so defile
themselves after washing. Though the
dead should never rise again, Christs Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
might be conducible to this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Life, whilst by That they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into the Church, and had their
former sins washed away, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
cleansed: and also it might be
seviceable to the Future Life, for the
salvation and happines of their Souls,
though their Bodies were unconcerned.
But 4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, to say no more, This Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the words is faulty in the same
kind that the two former were, that is,
it is irreconcileable to the Propriety of
speech, and the Usage of the Tongue
in which the Apostle wrote: which I
cannot but believe till it is proved to me
that These two are of the same import,
<hi>viz. to be baptized for the dead,</hi> and <hi>to
be baptized when they are dying,</hi> or <hi>at
their death:</hi> which is the thing that the
Abettors of this Exposition contend for,
but it could never yet be made out by
any Parallel place of Scripture, or the
least Testimony of Approved Authors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

places: or <hi>over the dead,</hi> i. e. <hi>upon</hi>
the Tombs, and <hi>over</hi> the Sepulchres of
the newly deceased Martyrs, which were
call'd <hi>Memoriae Martyrum,</hi> and so the
words refer to the Custom of baptizing
persons over the dead Martyrs graves
or tombs. Here first, I shall grant that
according to the <hi>Syriack</hi> it is rendred
<hi>super mortuos, upon, above,</hi> or <hi>over the
dead.</hi> Secondly, I grant that the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Commemorations of the Holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
even at the Time of administring
of Baptism, were no unusual things of
old, and have Great Antiquity to Assert
them. But then, This I have to say
that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is not so Easie and
Obvious an Acception as That which
I have to offer (and certainly the Easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and Plainest is to be deemed the most
Natural and Genuine.) Again, though
the <hi>Praeposition</hi> in the Text frequently
signifies <hi>over</hi> or <hi>above,</hi> and that with a
Genitive case, when it is applied to a
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:99329:90"/>
               <hi>place,</hi> yet it may be question'd whether
it hath the same signification when it is
joyned with <hi>persons,</hi> as here: for though
the baptizing be supposed to be over
the <hi>Graves,</hi> yet it is properly over <hi>those
that are<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dead,</hi> who are considered as <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
here: at least their <hi>bodies,</hi> not the
<hi>places</hi> they were in, are spoken of here.
But I will not insist on this, but will
rather suppose it to be Good Greek for
the sake of the Chief Author of this
Opinion, the Admirable <hi>Vossius,</hi> who was
as Eminent a Grammarian as he was a
Divine. But further, I could object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this Custom as a <hi>Superstitious one,</hi>
and therefore not fit to be made an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul.</hi>
Again, if this Ceremony of administring
Baptism <hi>over the dead</hi> were wholly void
of <hi>Superstition,</hi> yet I am not satisfied that
That Practice was at all in use in our
<hi>Apostle</hi>'s time. Nay, the <hi>Evangelical
History</hi> is against it, for we read there
that<note n="d" place="margin">Iohn 3 28.</note>

<hi>Ecclesiastical History</hi> relates that in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Ages
the <hi>Fonts</hi> and the <hi>Graves</hi> were
together, the <hi>Baptisteria</hi> and the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:99329:91"/>
But that they were so at First, and that
the <hi>Memoriae M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

therefore there is no evidence that the
Apostle had notice of any such thing,
and consequently he could not mention
it in his Writings. But let us <hi>suppose</hi>
(what we cannot <hi>grant</hi>) that even
whilst the Apostle lived, such a practice
was more rarely and privately used, yet
it is not credible that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul,</hi> the Great
Master of Logick and Discourse, would
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:99329:92"/>
argue from a thing so Obscure and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal,

call upon the name of Iesus Christ our
Lord</hi> (as you read in the front of this

it be thought worthy of the clear and

brought up at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> to
build the Great Doctrine of the <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi>
on a Vain Observance and a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
Error of some Conceited Hereticks?
If there were such a thing as a Posthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Baptism (if I may so call it,) a
Representative Washing, <hi>Vicarium Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisma,</hi>
as <hi>Tertullian</hi> stiles it, a Sacrament
by a Proxy or Deputy, even when the
party most concern'd was in another world,
if you can imagine that there was such a
thing as This in the <hi>Apostle's</hi> days, yet can
you think likewise that this is the thing
design'd in These words? Could so vain
and Idle a Rite come into the Apostle's
mind upon This occasion? Would he
argue from a Vain Abuse of Baptism by
Hereticks? Would the Apostle proceed
upon the Errors of others? This would
be no Simple and Absolute Proof, but
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:99329:93"/>
it would only be significant to those Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous

you imagine that this Holy man would
so lightly pass by and overlook so Gross
an Abuse of the Baptismal Institution,
that he would not reflect in the least
on so Notorious a Pollution of that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
when he had taken particular
notice of the very Postures and Habit
of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> of the <hi>mens Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

for these disorders? Why would he <hi>now</hi>
be silent, or (I may say) dissemble, when
he had at other times smartly checked
lesser Errors and Obliquities? S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

the <hi>manner</hi> of this Absurd practice
of those <hi>Hereticks,</hi> where he tells us that
they used to put a Living man under
the bed of the Deceased, and then the

be Baptized: whereupon he that was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

and desired Baptism, and him they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
baptized in the place of the

there at large, but he tells his Auditors

S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> needed not to have sought
for Aides from falshood and Error, when
the Truth it self is sufficiently Armed,
and hath Auxiliaries enough of its own
to defend its cause. I might add also,
that This Practice supposes a Reiterating
of the Sacrament of Baptism, which is an
Absurd thing; unless it be said that those
persons were baptized only for Others:
but then it cannot be denied that at the
same time they were really Baptized
Themselves. This Meaning of the words
therefore will but little Credit our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
and therefore I have the less
Esteem for it. And I have none at all
for that which follows, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph

Scaliger,</hi> according to whom <hi>the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
for the dead,</hi> are those who are <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
for the benefit and advantage of
the dead.</hi> It is granted indeed that This
might be True according to the Letter,
or Grammatical part, for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> sometimes
is as much as <hi>in utilitatem seu commodum</hi>
in Good Authors. And accordingly it
is said often in the New Testament that
Christ died <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not only <hi>in our
stead,</hi> but <hi>for us,</hi> i. e. for our Good and
Advantage, <hi>viz.</hi> that he might purchase
Salvation and Eternal Happiness for us.
But the <hi>meaning</hi> which the aforesaid
Author conveys to us by This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
is intolerably Absurd and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious;
and it is no other then
This, that the Apostle here in mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the susception of <hi>Baptism for the
dead,</hi> points at some Pious Office of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
or Baptizing the dead,</hi> or <hi>being
Baptized for them in order to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment
of their souls.</hi> The rise of it,
he saith, was This, that the Antients
thought the souls of the dead were Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prison'd
in the earth till the day of
Judgment, which he labours to prove
out of <hi>Tertullian, Augustin,</hi> and <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius:</hi>
and from That Error, saith this
Great man, was propagated the doctrine
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:99329:94"/>
of Christs Descent into Hell. Now peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were mightily concerned for these
Close Prisoners, and they were desirous
to purchase some Refreshing for the souls
of their friends and relations. To this
purpose they frequently Pray'd, and made
Oblations for them, and they were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to do Any thing, that their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
friends might fare as well as might
be till the Last day. And on this same
ground they used <hi>Baptism for the dead,</hi>
and that annually on a certain day, <hi>viz.</hi>
the Calends of <hi>February,</hi> as<note n="o" place="margin">C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ntr. Marcion. l. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Tertullian</hi>
saith expressly: and even to this day,
saith <hi>Scaliger,</hi> some of the <hi>Ethiopian</hi>
Church yearly renew their Baptism at
the Feast of <hi>Epiphany;</hi> which very thing
<note n="p" place="margin">Disputat. 17. de Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismo.</note> 
               <hi>Vossius</hi> also testifies of the <hi>Ethiopian</hi>
Christians. And <hi>Scaliger</hi> explains This
Custom yet further out of <hi>Lactantius</hi>
and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Augustin,</hi> and rangeth it among
the <hi>Ineptiae Patrum &amp; Ecclesiae Doctorum,</hi>
The Dotages of the Primitive Church.
Hence, saith he, is the Apostle's heavy
Censure of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in the 34 v. of
this Chapter, <hi>some have not the knowledge
of God: I speak this to your shame,</hi> From
which words this Mighty Critick would
prove that the Practice, from which the
Argument in the Text is drawn, was no
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:99329:95"/>
ways Good and Laudable, though the
Argument it self which the Apostle useth
be solid enough. But this is a Mistake,
for when it is said, <hi>some have not the
knowledge of God,</hi> it is apparent that it
strikes at those who denied or questioned
the <hi>Resurrection of the dead,</hi> as you may
easily be convinced by perusing what
immediately follows in 35 &amp; 36 v.
<hi>Some man will say, how are the dead raised
up, and with what body do they come?
Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not
quickned except it die:</hi> and v. 38. <hi>God
giveth it a body as it pleaseth him.</hi> From
whence it is clear that the fond and foolish
reasoning of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> about the
manner of the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> and their
shamefull ignorance of the Almighty
power of God concerning it, are the things
which the Apostle there rebukes them
for. He tells them that <hi>some have not
the knowledge of God,</hi> in the same sense
that our Saviour reproved the Sadducees,
saying, <hi>ye do erre not knowing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
nor the power of God,</hi> Mat. 22.
29. And as for the use of that Officious
Baptizing for the benefit of the dead,
(which <hi>Scaliger</hi> thinks is intended in this
place,) before it gain our assent, 'tis to
be proved that that fond and Idle Rite
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:99329:95"/>
had a being in the <hi>Apostle's d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ys,</hi> and
was well known to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> which
is not yet Proved, and so he cannot be
thought to have an eye to any such
thing. Or, if we should be so liberal
of our Concessions as to grant that such
a Custom was on foot when the Apostle
writ this Epistle (which it is utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to prove) yet have we no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to think (unless we can swallow
down the Doctrine of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and
perswade our selves that that Officious
Washing was available to cool those
Flames) unless, I say, we can digest
this, we have no reason to believe that
the Present Argument is drawn thence.
But on the contrary, it is highly ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
to maintain, that This passage of
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul,</hi> and That of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Peter</hi> in his 1 Epist.
3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Chap. and 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> v. (of which we shall
next speak,) with other places of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Writ, have been forcibly drawn by
perverse men to patronize the Gainfull
doctrine of <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for the rescuing
of souls out of the prison of <hi>Purgatory.</hi>
Besides, I might ask, what doth free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from Purgatory, which happens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Resurrection, conduce to the
<hi>confirming the Resurrection?</hi> They
are, they say, <hi>baptized for the dead,</hi> to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:99329:96"/>
free their freinds from Purgatory, but
That may be though there be no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection:
for it is the Soul, not the
Body that suffers the pains of Purgatory.
Nay further, it doth not appear that
even in After-Ages the practice which
<hi>Scaliger</hi> speaks of did prevail, <hi>viz.</hi> that
the Living were baptized <hi>for the Benefit
of the dead.</hi> For the Annual Baptizing
on a certain day, which he alledgeth for
his purpose, argues no such thing. It
was done only in remembrance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
of <hi>Christs Baptism,</hi> which was
performed by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Iohn</hi> on the <hi>Calends of
February,</hi> according to some, or on the
<hi>Epiphany,</hi> according to others. That day
is call'd <gap reason="foreign">

or because<note n="q" place="margin">

He that consults the Antients shall find
that they generally assert Christ was
Born and Baptized on the same day of
the year, which they think they prove
from <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 23. This day being, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their opinion, so signalized by
our Saviours Birth and Baptism, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
a very High day, and was in
Great Esteem among them; in so much
it seems that they repeated their Own
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:99329:96"/>
Baptism on that day. And for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
some of the <hi>Abissine</hi> Christians (whom
<hi>Scaliger</hi> calls the <hi>Ethiopian Church)</hi>
yearly Baptize themselves in Rivers and
Lakes on <hi>Epiphany</hi> day. And I could
add from a Late Author, that the Bishops
in <hi>Muscovy</hi> at this day consecrate the
Rivers on the <hi>Epiphany</hi> every year. But
what is all this to the purpose? Is here
any Baptizing <hi>for the benefit of the dead?</hi>
No assuredly. I am ready to grant also,
that <hi>Baptizing of the dead</hi> was used here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
by some Christians. This is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
as that it was usual<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to give the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Sacrament to the dead: <hi>which both</hi>
appear to have been Practised from the
Sixth Canon of the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Council of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi>
and the 83 of the Council of
<hi>Trullo,</hi> in which you find a Prohibition
against that administring the Eucharist

               <hi>Buxtorf</hi>
acquaints us, that the Infant that died
before it was eight days old was Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised
in the Burying-place, over the
grave. And that is yet more Fond, which
I have read of a people among the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi>
who had so great an opinion of
<hi>Matrimony,</hi> that if their sons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
died before Age, they solemnized a
Marriage between the parties after death.
Such a piece of Folly was <hi>the Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
of the dead,</hi> which was practised
(we grant) in some Ages after the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
and Those <hi>Learned Lawyers</hi> think
it was sounded on the Text. Yet any
Unp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ejudiced man may see that there is
not the least foundation in the words
for such a Practise: for it is impossible
to make These two one, <hi>Baptizing the
dead,</hi> or <hi>baptizing persons when they are
dead,</hi> and <hi>being Baptized for the Benefit
of the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. There is another Opinion which
may be referred to This First Rank of
Interpreters, and that is, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
speaks here of the Custom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in the Church <hi>of giving Names
in Baptism in memory of the dead.</hi> This,
saith<note n="t" place="margin">In Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citat. Sacr. in locum.</note> 
               <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:99329:97"/>
that goes this way) was in use
among the Old Christians, and thence
the <hi>Nominalia</hi> were instituted and so,
lemnly observed by them, which were
Festival days kept by the Christians
yearly in remembrance of the <hi>Name</hi> given
them in Baptism. These <hi>Nominalia</hi> (as
<hi>Tertullian</hi> calls them) or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
(as <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> stiles them)
were first derived from the <hi>Iews</hi> in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,
at which time the Infants had
the Names given them of their Parents
or Near<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st Kindred and Friends deceased
(which is con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ed in the Evangelical
History by that dispute which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

               </gap> 
               <hi>Iohn</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist.)
And this usage prevailed in the
<hi>Christian</hi> Church afterwards, and they
were wont to give their Children the
Names of their Kindred who had excell'd
an vertue for These were thought to
inspite them by the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Worthy Examples.
And by this means also the Names of
their departed friends were Recorded,
and their Memories preserved, and they
seem'd to Survive in those that bore
their Names. These were said to be
<hi>Baptized for the dead,</hi> i. e. (saith that
Learned Critick,) <hi>in gratiam &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriam
mortuorum.</hi> They might justly
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:99329:98"/>
be said <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to <hi>raise up the
Name of the dead,</hi> as those were said to
do among the <hi>Iews,</hi> who being next of
kin married the widow of the deceased.
The Apostle then is thought by Him
to refer to That giving of the <hi>Names
of the dead</hi> to those that were <hi>Baptized,</hi>
because That was in Memory and Honour
of the expired friends, in hope of their
<hi>Resurrection,</hi> and in belief of <hi>Eternity;</hi>
for though they were Dead, yet they
really Lived in another world. Thus
therefore the Argument is supposed to
run, Why are those Names of departed
Parents and Friends given to the Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
Relations, if those persons are not at
all in being? To what purpose were this
if the Deceased utterly perished, and
after death were never to rise again?
The <hi>Resurrection</hi> supposeth the Souls
Immortality, and so believing. This we
cannot question the Other. The persons
wearing the <hi>Names</hi> of those that are
dead, do hereby tell the world that they
believe their Pious Parents and Friends
are still in being, and at the last day
shall rise again. What shall they do,
how fondly do they act who are thus
baptized themselves, or baptize others
in Memory of the Dead, if they believe
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:99329:98"/>
not the Resurrection? else why do they
consider the Deceased as yet Living when
they give or bear the Names of those
persons? The Answer to all this in short
is, 1. If such a custom was in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
times, yet it seems to be too
Particular and too Mean a one to ground
so Great and General a matter on.
2. Tis not giving or receiving a Name
that is here spoken of, but <hi>Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing,</hi>
which is another thing, and of
more moment. And why <hi>Baptism</hi> should
be put here for <hi>Imposition of Names</hi> in
Baptism I see no reason, unless it could
be proved that an Improper Acception
of a word is more agreeable then the
Proper and Native one. 3. It is not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that Names were generally and
commonly given at Baptism so early. If
we consult the History even of the
Times soon after Christ, we shall read
of very few (which I somewhat won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at, I confess) who bore the Names
either of the Evangelists or Apostles,
or other Martyrs. 4. To argue from
the Imposition of the Names of the
dead to their Certain Rising again is no
ways firm and solid. And therefore it
is not probable on These Considerations
that This was the sense of the Apostle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:99329:99"/>
9. In the next place I will propound
the Opinion of that late Learned Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
<hi>Alexander More,</hi> who in his Notes
on some Select places of the New Tosta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
understands this place of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental
Baptism,</hi> but by <hi>the dead</hi>
(which in the Greek is in the <hi>Plural</hi>)
he thinks is denoted a <hi>Singular Person,</hi>
and that person is <hi>Christ:</hi> and to <hi>be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
for the dead,</hi> is to be <hi>baptized for
Christ,</hi> the meaning of which you may
find in that Author. I will only here
take notice of the Unreasonableness of
his Interpretation, so far as he understands
<hi>Christ</hi> by <hi>those that are dead.</hi> It is true
I grant that there are several Examples
of the change of the Singular number
for the Plural in Holy Scripture. This
<hi>Syllepsis,</hi> or <hi>Synechdoche,</hi> or <hi>Enallage nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meri</hi>
(call it as you please) is frequent
in the Sacred Stile, and it is most used
when some Eminent Person or Thing is
meant. And I grant that Christ was the
most Eminent Person, and his Death
the most Signal and Remarkable Thing
that ever was. But I cannot think that
the Apostle <hi>here</hi> expresses the Singular
by the Plural, because 1. the Apostle
here mentions <hi>the dead three times,</hi> which
shews he means it in the true proper
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:99329:99"/>
sense. For it were tolerable to put the
Plural for the Singular once, but to <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat</hi>
it is unusual, much more to speak
after the same manner a <hi>third time</hi> is
not to be allowed. Where you meet
with the <hi>Change of Numbers</hi> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
it is <hi>by the by,</hi> and not frequent;
but this Reiterating of it is no where
to be found, which is an Argument that
[<hi>the dead</hi>] here is no such kind of
speech, but that it is a way of speaking
after the ordinary rate, and consequently
that one Number is not put for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
2. All along in this Chapter <hi>Christ</hi>
is spoken of, and represented <hi>as Risen;</hi>
how comes it to pass that the Character
is here altered, and that now by <hi>the Dead</hi>
(thrice named) we must understand
<hi>Christ?</hi> 3. When we can satisfie ourselves
very well with the <hi>Propriety</hi> of speech,
we have no reason to fancy <hi>Improprieties,</hi>
and then to flie to that meaning which is
contain'd in them. This is our present
case, the Apostle here speaks in the Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and we can very well understand
him. Why must we imagine that he
intends the Singular when he expresses
himself Plurally? Why must we make
him speak Improperly when we can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
him as well, nay better in his
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:99329:100"/>
Proper way of speaking? Thus we
have no good ground to think that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
is put for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>There is another Interpretation yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining,
even of those who take <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing</hi>
here in the <hi>Sacramental sense.</hi> But
That being the Interpretation which I
shall fix upon as the most Probable and
Accountable, I will therefore reserve it
for the Close of all.</p>
            <p>Thus far we have examined those <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions</hi>
of the Text which make it to
be understood of <hi>Sacramental Washing,</hi>
signally stiled <hi>Baptism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. There are a Second sort of Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitors
who will have the words meant
of <hi>the Washing of the dead bodies in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to Burial</hi> and of this opinion <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi>
is the chief Patron, in his <hi>Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
on the place, and he is followed
by <hi>Paraeus.</hi> It was indeed an ordinary
practice to <hi>wash the corps</hi> before their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terment,
and what S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Luke</hi> tells us of
<hi>Tabitha,</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 37. is a Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it. 'Tis likely say these Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
that this was done in belief and
expectation of the <hi>Rising again</hi> of those
bodies; and therefore it is probable the
Apostle argues from the received rite and
custom of <hi>Washing the bodies of the dead</hi>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:99329:100"/>
before they layd them in the grave, for
this Cleansing (and Anointing too, for
that also was usual) was a visible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of the belief of a future Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.
What shall they do that make use
of this Sepulcral Washing, to what purpose
do they observe this rite if the flesh be
never to rise again? T <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; what
doth this action of theirs signifie? to
what end is it? why are all nations sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous
about the liveless carcass? to
what tends all this care of theirs if the
body shall not experience the happiness
of a Restauration? The Reply to this
is casie, 1. The notion of <hi>baptizing</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this interpretation, is forced
and distorted, for though <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> may
and doth signifie <hi>Washing</hi> in the more
General sense, and is applied to <hi>Common
Washings,</hi> in <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 4. &amp; <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10.
yet there is no reason to relinquish the
more Noted Acception of it in the stile
of the New Testament: and here to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
it to the custom of <hi>Funeral Washing</hi>
is very odd and unaccountable. 2. Though
the Christians used this sort of Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cral
Washing, yet how doth it appear
that This was a Proof of the <hi>Resurrection
of the dead? Durandus</hi> in his <hi>Rationale</hi>
tells you that the Christians washed the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:99329:101"/>
dead, to shew that their Souls were clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
from sin by Confession and Pennance.
3. This Funeral Washing was in use a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Iews</hi> as well as those that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
Christianity. Now 'tis known that
the <hi>Sadducets</hi> acknowledged no such thing
as a <hi>Resurrection,</hi> and therefore their
Washing the dead could have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the Rising again of the dead.
Again, 4<hi rend="sup">ly•</hi>, the <hi>Ablutio <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
               </hi> (as
<hi>Plautus</hi> calls it) was used by the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi>
as well as Christians; and it is not
to be thought that These did it with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the <hi>Resurrection.</hi> You may
learn why they washed the dead bodies
from<note n="u" place="margin">Quod vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delicet ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumque pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telur exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus vitalis spiritus, qui calidac aqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them,</hi> for the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>

it being in order to <hi>Anointing:</hi> for it
was proper first to wash off the filth of

               <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 4. and thereby confirm the
Antiquity of this custom. Perhaps

of the <hi>Washing at the birth.</hi> Their

agreed upon it to End as they Began,
at Coming into and Going out of the

This Conjecture be not admitted, then
we must have recourse to the former Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
given of This Usage, or we may
yet further add that the generality of
the people who used the <hi>Lustral Washing,</hi>
did it either out of some Superstitious
humour, or barely to comply with Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom.
Take it in any of these Aspects,
it doth not look like an <hi>Argument</hi> that
the Apostle would make use of for the
proof of the <hi>Resurrection.</hi> 5. To say
no more, the Criticizing genius of this
Modern Expositor fails him here, for
what Construction can reconcile these
two, and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ke them the same, <hi>viz.</hi> the
<hi>washing of the dead</hi> (i. e. washing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
after they are dead) and <hi>washing
for the dead?</hi> These are vastly different,
and it was never heard that there was
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:99329:102"/>
any Affinity between the one and the
other. Therefore this Sepulchral Wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ought to be dissallowed here; Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
will not vouch it: Which is a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
confutation of the Opinion, though
there were nothing else to say.</p>
            <p>III. A <hi>Third</hi> sort of Interpreters are
(as fondly) of opinion that the words
refer to a <hi>Legal and Ceremonious Wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
used among the Iews after their
touching of a dead body, or going into the
Sepulchres, or standing too near the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that were breathing their last.</hi> The
Pollution which they contracted by this
means was to be purged away by <hi>Wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves.</hi> And indeed it happens
that the word <gap reason="foreign">

it) which he saith was instituted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind
the <hi>Israelites</hi> of the Resurrection
of the dead. But I do not find that he
hath gain'd any considerable Proselytes
to his opinion, it being so sorrily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, and having so little reason to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon. For to be baptized or washed
<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>

               <hi>From the dead,</hi> i. e. from the
pollution contracted by touching or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
near the dead, are vastly different.
Washing themselves after their being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
by a dead body, what is that to
<hi>Washing for the dead?</hi> And as this <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saick
Washing</hi> hath no <hi>Grammer,</hi> so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath it any <hi>Logick</hi> to appear in its
behalf, for it miserably perverts the sense
of the words, and the Consequence of
the Apostle's discourse, which I leave
you to examine.</p>
            <p>And so doth that Other Opinion of
<hi>Turrianus</hi> the Jesuite, who will needs
have this <hi>baptizing for the dead</hi> relate
to <hi>a Legal Washing or Purifying of the
dead bodies.</hi> It is his fancy that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
argues from the practice of the
<hi>Iews,</hi> among whom it was usual that if
any man died Legally unclean (i. e. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was purified from his Uncleanness
according to the Law, <hi>Num.</hi> 19.) some
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:99329:103"/>
other person was washed and cleansed in
his stead: for they thought, saith he,
that this Purging profited the dead, and
by this means the Uncleanness which he
died in would not hurt him, nay that
he should be thereby cleansed: and by
this Ceremony too they professed their
faith of the Immortality of the soul and
the Resu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rection of the dead, against the
heres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of the Sadducees. But the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of this Conceit is enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
it: for first, there is no proof that
there ever was any such Practice; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
there is no reason to think that
the Apostle by <hi>Baptizing</hi> means any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then <hi>Sacramental Baptism;</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
any man may guess that the Jesuite
chiefly design'd this Exposition for the
sake of his so much admired doctrine
of <hi>Pargatory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for that end have <hi>Others of the
Church of Rome</hi> fastned another, but as
Improbable a Meaning on the words.
Which brings me to the <hi>Last</hi> rank of
Interpreters, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IV. Those that will have the <hi>Baptizing</hi>
in the Text to be understood in a <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical</hi>
sense. It is the dream of <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton</hi>
and <hi>Salmeron,</hi> and some others of
that party, that because by <hi>Baptism</hi> or
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:99329:104"/>
               <hi>Washing,</hi> is meant <hi>Affliction</hi> or <hi>Suffering,</hi>
in <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 23. therefore the persons
who are said to be <hi>baptized for the dead,</hi>
are such Kind souls who, to do the dead
a Courtefie, undergo all sorts of Afflictions
and Hardships. As if S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> had said,
What shall they do who voluntarily suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
so much in This world to help those
that are in misery in another? What
shall they do that baptize themselves as
'twere in their Sweat and Tears, and
bathe themselves in their own Bloud
to redeem poor souls from the pains of
Purgatory? What will become of them
that do and suffer any thing for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the dead, if the dead shall not
rise? Why do they inure themselves to
Long Prayers and tedious Fastings? Why
do they undergo the Baptism of <hi>Pennance</hi>
and <hi>Almsdeeds?</hi> (for <hi>Bellarmine</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
it so, and <hi>Salmeron</hi> upon the place
tells us, that <hi>Alms</hi> are a kind of <hi>Wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
for which he quoteth forsooth <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticus</hi>
3. 30. <hi>Water will quench a fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
fire, and Alms maketh an atonement
for sins;</hi> and Luke 11. 4. <hi>Give alms,
and behold, all things are Clean unto
you.</hi>) Why do so many undertake Long
Pilgrimages, wear Hair Shirts, roll them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in Snow, Scourge and Torture
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:99329:104"/>
themselves, and go through all the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
of Self-denial, if they do not think
These things will prove <hi>Satisfactions</hi> for
disobedient souls. Why do they relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish
the world, and study nothing but Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
and Mortifications and Austere Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises
of their bodies, if they could not
by These Arts do the Dead some good?
Why are they thus <hi>baptized</hi> or <hi>afflicted</hi>
for the dead? Certainly this Baptizing
will mitigate the flames of Purgatory,
and inable the distressed Prisoners to get
loose the sooner out of that Painfull Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
That which I have to Reply
to This is 1. that it is an odd Notion
and Way of these men to reckon <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petance,</hi>
and <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>msdeeds,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<hi>Afflictions</hi> and <hi>Sufferings</hi> and <hi>Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
This is a doctrine which no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
but themselves ever taught. 2. Let
it be remembred that although Penances
for the dead were in use among the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,</hi>
yet Gods People were particularly
forbid to use any such thing, <hi>Deut. 14.
1. Ye shall not cut yourselves, nor make
any baldness between your eyes for the dead.</hi>
And shall not <hi>Christians</hi> think it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
as well as <hi>Iews?</hi> 3. Any man may
see that This is a plain fetch to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
That Doctrine which hath brought
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:99329:105"/>
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> so much Profit,
and therefore must be maintain'd right
or wrong. 4. Whereas they say the end
of these Services and Undertakings of
the living for the Dead is that the Souls
detain'd in Purgatory may be released;
I reply that this is fondly alle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ged, because
Purgatory is not a Prison for Bodies but
for Souls only (as they confess.) Now I
never heard of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of <hi>Souls,</hi>
but of <hi>Bodies;</hi> and of This the Apostle
speaks, <hi>If the dead rise not at all,</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it of the <hi>Bodies of the dead.</hi> So that
This Text hath no reference to what
they dream of. It speaks of another
thing, unless <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> are the same
thing. 5. It were enough to say that
this <hi>Obscure</hi> and <hi>Mysti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>al</hi> notion of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Baptized,</hi> is but seldom used in
the Stile of Scripture, and then (one

hath well observed. There can be no

to think that This <hi>Allegorical Baptis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi>
i. e. the <hi>Baptism of Suffering,</hi> is intended.</p>
            <p>I might annex here the Opinion of
our Learned Rabbi D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> who
is the only <hi>Protestant</hi> of any note<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
except <hi>Vostius,</hi> who interprets this
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:99329:105"/>
place of the <hi>Metaphorical Baptism,</hi> the
Baptism of Suffering. <hi>What shall they
do that are baptized for the dead, if the
dead</hi> &amp;c. is as much, saith he, as if the
Apostle had said,<note n="h" place="margin">Harmony of the N. Test.</note> 
               <hi>If the dead rise not
again, what will become of those that are
baptized with a Martyrial Baptism, or that
do suffer Death for the profession of the
Truth:</hi> And he adds, to confirm this
Interpretation, that the <hi>Iewish Baptizings
or Dippings in their purifications were
a very sharp piece of Religion, when in
frost and snow, and wind and weather, they
must over head and ears in cold water,
from which the phrase was used to signifie
Death and the Bitterest Sufferings.</hi>
Whence he gathers that <hi>Baptism for the
dead</hi> in this place, is suffering of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom:
and consequently he makes this
to be the sense of the Text, <hi>What shall
they do who have or do undergo Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?
what shall become of them if their
bodies rise not again?</hi> Thus he. But
who sees not that this is a very ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
notion, and taken up only from that
<hi>Iewish</hi> way of speaking which he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
whereas, if we consider it well,
there is no affinity at all between the
one and the other. Though the <hi>Iewish
Baptisms</hi> might be made use of to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:99329:106"/>
               <hi>Great Severities, yea Death</hi> it self,
yet what is this to <hi>being baptized for the
dead?</hi> Baptism may represent Martyrdom,
but who can reasonably thence infer that
<hi>the baptized for the dead</hi> in this place are
those that were <hi>Martyred?</hi> There is not
the least Connection between these two.
It must be said then that this Worthy
and Reverend person espoused this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
merely upon the account of that
great reverence which he always paid
to the Jewish and Rabinical Writings,
of which most of his Opinions have a
tincture.</p>
            <p>There are some <hi>Other</hi> odd fancies which
I have met with on the words; as that
of <hi>Lyranus, Lombard</hi> and <hi>Aquinas,</hi> who
by <hi>the dead</hi> understand <hi>mortal sins,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by the Apostle <hi>dead works, Heb.</hi> 9.
1. &amp; 6. 14. for the expiation and wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away of which Holy Baptism was
ordained. But their own <hi>Stapleton</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes
This, saying the Apostle speaks not
of <hi>Sins</hi> but <hi>Men,</hi> not of <hi>Works,</hi> but <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</hi>
This and the rest of this sort I
pass by, as unwilling to entertain you
with Trifles. Some of the Other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations
before mention'd carry with
them a greater semblance of Truth or
Probability, and have some Antiquity
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:99329:106"/>
and Authority to recommend them. But
This and some of those lately mentioned,
are invented on purpose to be assistant
to a <hi>Bad Cause,</hi> which they are willing
to support by the Multitude of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
seeing they are not able to
do it by the Goodness and Solidity of
them.</p>
            <p>V. I will now at last offer to you
the Interpretation which I conceive is
most Reasonable and Accountable, and
which I doubt not will gain your Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage
and Assent upon a deliberate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of it. Before I present you
with This Exposition, I will make way
for it by premising These three things.</p>
            <p>1. That I intend to adhere to the
<hi>First rank of Expositors,</hi> who (as you
may remember) understand the words
of <hi>Baptism Properly so call'd,</hi> i. e. some
kind of <hi>Real Washing,</hi> and particularly
of the <hi>Sacramental Baptism,</hi> whereby we
are Initiated into the Church of Christ.
For why should we without Necessity
and Urgent Reason (and I can see no
such thing here) understand the words
of a <hi>Metaphorical Baptism?</hi> It is a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Rule delivered by<note n="i" place="margin">De D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Austin,</hi> that
we ought not to interpret those things
Allegorically which are spoken Properly,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:99329:107"/>
and that we must never depart from the
Literal and Proper sense of Scripture,
unless it be manifestly proved that such
a sense is not to be followed. The
Usual and Proper signification is first to
be attended to, and it is not fit we flie
to Borrowed and Figutative senses, so long
as the Natural and Genuine one will serve
our turns. This then I assert, that the
Apostle speaks here of the Usual and
Received Baptism of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But the main thing in the words
is the <hi>Praeposition.</hi> Therefore</p>
            <p>2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, I premise this, that the Praeposition
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is here translated <hi>for,</hi> is as much

and thereby convinced the Learned how
faulty the <hi>Grammar,</hi> as well as the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity</hi>
of that Heretick is. I doubt not
therefore that the Paaeposition signifies
here an <hi>Impulsive Cause,</hi> and is taken
in the same sense that it is in those places
where it is said, <hi>the Gentiles should glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risie
God</hi> for <hi>his mercy,</hi> Rom. 15. 9. i. e.

so the Praeposition ought to be rendred

               </hi>
(How This is to be applied I will shew
you anon.) Having thus laid down what
I understand by the Verb <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and
the Praeposition <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (in which the Main
difficulty of the Text lies,) I must also
Premise and Observe this to you,</p>
            <p>3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, That it is not barely <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
without an <hi>Article</hi> (as the Learned <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi>
also noteth on the place, and saith
it is not without some singular Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis.)
The <hi>Praepositive Article o</hi> is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
of the like force with the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, and the English <hi>that,</hi> which are
notes of Emphasis and Specification. It
is probable therefore tht not All but
<hi>Some Certain dead</hi> are here meant, for
this <hi>Article,</hi> which is here <hi>Demonstrative,</hi>
denotes something that is <hi>Certain and
Definitive.</hi> It is true, it is sometimes
left out, and other times inserted, and
yet the sense is neither heightned not
impaired, and I deny not that it is so
in some places in This Chapter. But
since it is oftentimes Significant and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical,
and becomes a Relative and
Demonstrative Pronoun, it may be so
in This Text that is before us, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
the Article being expressed
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:99329:108"/>
               <hi>twice,</hi> and it being likely (as I will make
it appear) that it <hi>particularly</hi> relates to
something mention'd before in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
So that the words are to run thus,
<hi>What shall they do that are baptized by
reason of, or for the sake of those dead,
<hi>viz.</hi> those dead</hi> before spoken of? And
now that you may understand <hi>Who those
dead</hi> are, and that we may the better
apprehend the Whole Arguing of the
Apostle in the Text, and at the same
time give the Confirmation of the Sense
which I am to offer, I will present you
with a short view of the <hi>Context.</hi> This
is the best way certainly to enervate and
destroy the former Opinions, and to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
a right Judgement of the Text,
By setting before you the Scope of the
words, and their Coherence with and
Relation to the foregoing parts of the
Chapter, I despair not of leading you to
the True Meaning of the words.</p>
            <p>The Scope and Design of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> in
this Chapter is to establish the Doctrine
of <hi>Our Resurrection,</hi> That so Weighty
and Important Doctrine, to which he
gives the Name of <hi>The Gospel,</hi> v. 1.
This Great Article of the Christian faith
(which some of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
into question) is here maintain'd by
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:99329:109"/>
several Arguments; the first whereof
is <hi>Christs Resurrection,</hi> which he tells
us was attested by above five hundred
witnesses, some of whom he saith <hi>are
fallen asleep,</hi> v. 6. The same, you know,
is expressly said of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Stephen</hi> by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelist
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Luke:</hi> and without doubt
our Apostle speaks here of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Stephen,</hi>
who was stoned to death, (<hi>Acts</hi> 7. 60.)
and of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Iames</hi> the first Martyr of all
the Apostles, who was beheaded by <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod
Agripppa, Acts,</hi> 12. 2. And<note n="l" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. l. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Clemens</hi>
tells us that <hi>another</hi> died at the very
same time: he relates how the person
that carried S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Iames</hi> to the Place of
Judgement, and heard him there so fully
give testimony to Christ, was thereby
Converted, and presently professed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be a Christian: whereupon both
of them were carried together to Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and were (as he reports) beheaded.
The Apostle may be thought likewise
to speak here of the <hi>Other Iames,</hi> who
was also called <hi>Iames, the Iust;</hi> who
was barbarously knock'd on the head by
the Jews in <hi>Nero</hi>'s time, as <hi>Eusebius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports.
But whether This <hi>Iames</hi> was
put to death before S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> writ. This
Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
determine. We might also here
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:99329:109"/>
reckon <hi>Philip</hi> the Apostle, who was put
to death at the same time that <hi>Iames the
Iust</hi> was, as some relate: whence it is
that Our Church celebrates the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of them both on the same day. But
it is unquestionable that <hi>Iohn the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,</hi>
who was the First Martyr, <hi>fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep</hi>
before all These, being beheaded
by a former <hi>Herod,</hi> in the first year of
our Saviours Preaching. And there were
<hi>Many Others</hi> who were crowned with
Martyrdom, as our Apostle himself testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth,
<hi>Acts, 26. 10. Many of the Saints
did I shut up in prison; and when they
were put to death, I gave my voice against
them.</hi> There were <hi>Many</hi> that <hi>suffered
Martyrdom,</hi> who are therefore said to be
<hi>fallen asleep in Christ,</hi> v. 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of this
Chapter. Still he mentions those that
<hi>are fallen asleep, viz.</hi> those holy men
that Sacrificed their lives for the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel:
those are <hi>the dead</hi> whom the Text
speaks of. And hence he frames a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Argument to prove the Absurdity
which would follow upon denying the
<hi>Resurrection, Then they also which are
fallen asleep in Christ are perished.</hi> To
<hi>These very Saints</hi> who are thus fallen
asleep, who are the same with those men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
in 1 <hi>Thess. 4. 14. them which
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:99329:110"/>
sleep in Iesus,</hi> and in v. 16. <hi>the dead
in Christ,</hi> (the blessed Martyrs who died
for Christs sake,) to <hi>These</hi> my Text
hath relation. These were <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>those dead for whose sakes,</hi> and <hi>because
of whom</hi> so many in the Apostle's days
became Converts, and were <hi>Baptized.</hi>
These Martyrs, saith he, who <hi>are fallen
asleep in Christ are perished</hi> if there be
no <hi>Resurrection:</hi> they have utterly Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
themselves and others by losing
their lives for Christ. Thirdly, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
to Argue thus, as those Martyrs
were arrant Fools, and Perished like such,
if there be no <hi>Resurrection,</hi> so <hi>We</hi> that
survive are the Wretchedest creatures
upon earth if that be true: <hi>If in this
life only we have hope in Christ, we are
of all men most miserable,</hi> v. 19. <hi>But
now is Christ risen from the dead, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the first-fruits of them that slept,</hi>
saith the Apostle triumphantly in the
next verse. By this confident Assumption
he baffles the Gainsayers, and comforts
the Christian Church. But within two
verses after he breaks off this Argument
which he had newly resumed, and after
a Digression about the Manner of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Resurrection, and the final Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation
of the world (which reaches
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:99329:110"/>
from the 23. v. to the words of my
Text) he falls into a Fresh Argument thus,
<hi>Else what shall they do that are baptized
for the dead, if the dead rise not at all?
why are they also baptized for the dead?</hi>
The first word (as we have it translated)
<hi>Else,</hi> implies that this verse refers to the
immediately foregoing ones, or to some
General Conclusion before. But if you
examine both, you will not find any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection
between This and the immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preceding verses: and indeed the <hi>Syriack</hi>
leaves out this <hi>Alioquin</hi> or <hi>Else,</hi> as if
the Sentence were entire without it. I
conceive then that the Greek word is
not rightly translated here, but that it
ought to be rendred [<hi>Moreover,</hi>] <gap reason="foreign">

I spoke of before, who I told you were
<hi>fallen asleep,</hi> if the dead rise not at all,
if they awake not at the last day? why
are they also, or (as <hi>Grotius</hi> noteth, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>exgo,</hi>) why are
they <hi>therefore</hi> baptized <hi>upon the account.</hi>
or <hi>for the sake</hi> of <hi>those dead?</hi> why do
New Converts come in every day, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questing
to be admitted into the Church
by Holy Baptism? Is it not, think you,
<hi>for the sake</hi> of those excellent persons
who <hi>fell asleep in Christ?</hi> Is it not <hi>by
reason of them</hi> that they take up the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of Christianity? Yes surely; they
have seen the Lives and Miracles of
those Good men, they have observed
their Carriage and Constancy at their
deaths, and by this they are stirr'd up
effectually to own the same Cause, to
love the same Religion, and to admit
themselves into it by the Sacrament of
Baptism. <hi>Those dead</hi> Saints and Martyrs
(whose Memories and Acts are still
living) setch in these Great Numbers of
Converts. The Bloud of dying Saints
is the seed of the Church, which the
more plentifully it is sown and shed, yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:99329:111"/>
the Larger Increase of Converts.
Hence, hence it is that Proselytes come
in apace to Christianity, that Converts
flock to the Holy waters of Baptism, for
they well observing the Admirable Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
of those persecuted Christians
at their Death, are soon perswaded into
the belief of another Life. From their
Examples they are excited to a Love of
the Christian Religion, which they see
makes men live and die couragiously,
and hereupon they are zealous to be <hi>made
members</hi> of the Christian Church by the
Sacrament of <hi>Baptism.</hi> This is to be <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
for</hi> or <hi>because of the dead.</hi> Or, after
this manner, and in these words you may
imagine the Apostle to argue in my Text:
You see, O <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that the Sufferings
which the Christians undergo, are so far
from discouraging others from turning
Christians, that vast numbers of Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
are animated thereby to own the
Christian Profession, and to live and die
in the acknowledgement of it. See what
power and efficacy the Example of those
Saints hath, and how it works on the
hearts of the most Resolved, and makes
them presently renounce and forsake their
follies. Tell me, what makes the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
<hi>Gentile</hi> quit his former prophane
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:99329:112"/>
life? or what makes the Willful <hi>Iew</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
his Circumcision, and leave his
Mosaical Washings for the Laver of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Baptism? Is it not to be imputed
to This cause chiefly, <hi>viz.</hi> that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
and are ravished with the singular
behaviour of the Suffering Saints, who
contentedly quit all for Christ their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster?
They cannot but reverence and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
That Religion which inspires those
men with such Valour, and gives them
so Invincible a Courage: and immediately
hereupon they hasten to be Initiated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Society of such brave Christians.
Now, tell me, O ye men of <hi>Corinth,</hi> you
especially that question the Article of
the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> is it nothing that so
many every day voluntarily admit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into the Church by Holy Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
and that <hi>upon the account of the
Deceased</hi> Confessors and Martyrs, who
they see sacrifice all that is dear to them
to purchase another world? Why should
you think there is no Other Life, when
you see men lay down their Lives for
their Religion, and others presently ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
up that Religion for which they
lost their lives? And <hi>for what reason</hi> do
so Great Sholes of Converts come into
the Baptismal Waters? <hi>What shall they
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:99329:112"/>
do that are thus baptized?</hi> to what end
and design do they this, and continue to
do so? To <hi>what purpose, on what account</hi>
is it? You cannot but see that it is <hi>for
the sake</hi> of the Saints whose exemplary
Lives and Deaths they have beheld, and
thereby were throughly convinced of the
Truth of Christianity, which promises a
better life after this at the Resurrection
of the dead. Why are so many, I say,
stirred up to embrace Christianity, and
to enter into Holy Baptism? Is it not <hi>by
reason of</hi> the Deceased Saints and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres?
Is it not <hi>because of</hi> the Love and
Respect they bear Them, and the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Cause which they so bravely
maintain? Is it not hence that they run to
their Spiritual Guides and Instructers, and
beg to be Baptized: and if these demand
the Reason of it, is not This their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
we come to be <hi>Baptized for the
dead,</hi> i. e. we are moved to come to
the Holy Baptism <hi>by reason of those De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
Saints,</hi> whose Godly behaviour
we so much admired, whose Patience and
Courage to the last we were even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonished
at: <hi>because of</hi> These Worthy
Persons we are excited to enter into the
Baptismal Vow, and to admit ourselves
into their Religion, which is the best in
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:99329:113"/>
the world. What Interpretation can be

as to approach towards This Exposition,
or to give the least him of this Notion
which I have presented to you. Yet
certainly, if you weigh This well, you
will find it worthy of all acceptation:
for in all the forenamed Interpretations
there is either something Defective or

and <hi>Chronology,</hi> or an apparent <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consequence</hi>
in the way of Argument. In
summ, there were Bold Suppositions, but
Slender Proofs. Whereas you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
that in This Interpretation which
I have tendred to you, the Propriety of
the words is preserved entire: the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticism
is not strained: the Genuine and
Proper signification of the words is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held:
the whole Design of the Context
and of the Apostle's Arguing is disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd:
and the History of the Antient
Church, and the Relation of the best
Antiquity concurr to make This Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
Solid and Authentick. Here is
nothing begg'd, but all is free and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constrain'd. This is the clearest and most
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:99329:113"/>
reasonable Sense in it self, and likewise
the most accommodate to the Present Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of the Apostle in this Chapter, to
the Stile and Phraseology of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and to the whole Analogy of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith.</p>
            <p>And now in the close of all, to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
this Interpretation to Ourselves. We
have the same reason now to maintain
the Christian Religion that those first
good Converts had to embrace it. The
Consideration which made them enter
into Religion, should make us hold it fast.
For we as well as they prosess that
Religion which was attested by the Death,
and sealed with the Bloud of Martyrs.
Martyrdom made Christians then; let it
confirm us in Christianity now. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
let us be encouraged to love and
maintain our Religion, which we can hold
with Ease and all the Conveniencies of
this life. We are not forced to quit our
Lives that we may secure our Religion and
our Consciences. Blessed be God, we can
enjoy these here, and carry them with us
into another World afterwards. But if ever
the Divine Providence shall call us to lay
down our Lives, and spend our Bloud in
the service of our Lord and Saviour, let us
<hi>not count our Lives dear unto us,</hi> so that
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:99329:114"/>
               <hi>we may finish our course with joy, and
testifie the Gospel of the grace of God,</hi>
as our<note n="q" place="margin">Acts 20. 24.</note> Apostle speaketh. Let us, like
the Primitive Saints,<note n="r" place="margin">Acts 5. 41.</note> 
               <hi>rejoyce that we are
counted worthy to suffer shame,</hi> and even
Death <hi>for the Name of Christ.</hi> Let us
chearfully sacrifice our Lives for the sake
of him who Died for us, let us drown
our Affections to the world in our own
Bloud, thereby propagating our Holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and therein following the Pattern
of the Blessed Apostles and Primitive
Saints, who manfully and undauntedly died
for the faith: <hi>on whose account,</hi> and <hi>by
virtue of whose Example</hi> it was that
Thousands of Converted persons flock'd
to the Waters of Baptism, and were
ambitious to Assert that Cause for which
they saw those Excellent Christians lay
down their Lives. The Death of an
Eminent Saint made a great number of
Disciples in those days: the Bloud of a
Holy Martyr baptized whole Cities.
This I conceive was to be <hi>baptized for
the dead.</hi> This I offer as the most Plain
and Easie, the most Natural and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
Meaning of the Text.</p>

            <head>The fourth TEXT
Enquired into, viz.
<bibl>1 S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Peter III. 19, 20.</bibl>
               <q>By which also he went and preached

            </head>
            <p>THIS is another Difficult Text of
Scripture, and in order to the
Clearing of it, I will give you a brief
account of the Chapter. It begins with
the Peculiar and Proper Duties of Man
and Wife, which take up the first 7 ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
but the rest of the Chapter treats
of the Common Vertues and Graces
which are required in all Christians, as
Meekness, Patience, Mercifulness, and all
the obliging and indearing offices of Love.
The Apostle chiefly exhorts to <hi>Patience,</hi>
that is, to suffer with submission and
chearfulness what ever should be inflicted
on them. And here he shews particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
how they ought to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:99329:115"/>
towards their <hi>Persecutors.</hi> They
must not be Revengeful, and <hi>render e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
for evil,</hi> v. 9. and he subjoins the
Reasons of it in the following verses.
Again, They <hi>must not be afraid, neither
be troubled,</hi> v. 14. They must take
courage maugre all their distresses, and
strive to banish all Fear and Cowardice,
all Disorder and Perplexity of mind. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
they are obliged to <hi>sanctifie the
Lord God in their hearts, and to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to give an answer to every one that
asketh them a reason of the hope which is
in them,</hi> and that <hi>with meekness and fear,</hi>
v. 15. The meaning is that they were
not to disguise their perswasion; but to
make open profession of their Religion
even before their Persecutors. Further,
the Apostle tells them that they must
not only profess Christianity but lead
Holy Lives, that thereby they may <hi>shame</hi>
their Adversaries who <hi>falsly accuse</hi> them
<hi>as evil doers,</hi> v. 16. Lastly therefore
he bids them be sure that they look to
their Lives and Conversations, that <hi>they
suffer for well-doing, not for evil-doing,</hi>
v. 17. And that they may not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to suffer thus, here is set before
them the Example of <hi>Christ</hi> who suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for them, <hi>For Christ also hath once
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:99329:115"/>
suffer'd for sins, the just for the unjust,</hi>
v. 18. This highly commends the Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
of the <hi>Blessed Iesus</hi> that he was
himself an Innocent person, and that he
suffer'd for those that were Guilty: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
no Christians that suffer can alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
plead Innocency, they all in some
measure deserve what they suffer. And
now the Apostle takes occasion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiate
on <hi>Christs suffering,</hi> and the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
effects of it, to the end of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and in part of the next. He shews
the Design of our Saviours Passion, <hi>viz.
that he might bring us to God,</hi> v. 18.
that he might make us Holy and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and indue us with the Divine and
Godlike nature, and that he might at
last lead us to Heaven and Eternal Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
And this He was effectually ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to do, because, though he suffer'd
death, yet he soon rose from the dead,
as you read in that 18. v. <hi>Being put to
death in the flesh, but quickned by the
Spirit.</hi> To pass by the Notion of those
men who think they find some ground
here for their <hi>Aethereal</hi> or <hi>Spiritual Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicles,</hi>
understanding the words thus, Put
to death in his Terrestrial body, but quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
or enliven'd with a Spiritual one, for
Christs soul and the souls of all the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:99329:116"/>
Saints after death (say they) are clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
with Subtile and Aetherial bodies.
To let this pass, the Plain Meaning of
the place is this (and it is confirmed by
several of the<note n="a" place="margin">Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin, Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenius.</note> Fathers) that this <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
though he suffer'd and was <hi>put to
death</hi> for us <hi>in the flesh,</hi> as a Man, as
he had a Humane Body, yet he was
<hi>quickned by the Spirit,</hi> that is, he rose
from the dead by the vertue and power of
the Holy Spirit, who was ever with him.
Or thus, he was <hi>put to death in the flesh,</hi>
i. e. crucified in his Humane Nature, but
he was <hi>quickned in the spirit,</hi> i. e. he was
raised from the Dead by his Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
A Parallel place is that in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
13. 4. <hi>Though he was crucified through
weakness,</hi> (his body being but Weak
and Frail and subject to death, as all
Humane bodies are) <hi>yet he liveth by the
power of God,</hi> he reassumed his soul, and
lived again, and still liveth by vertue of
his Divine Power. He died as Man,
but restored himself to life as he was God.
It was by Christs Divine Spirit that his
separated soul and body were reunited:
which you find thus asserted by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul,</hi>
Rom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 4. <hi>He was declared to be the
son of God with power, according to the
Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:99329:116"/>
the dead.</hi> The humane spirit of Christ
was joyned again to his body by his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Spirit. By Christs Divinity his
Humanity was raised up, and restored.
And now our Apostle inlarges here fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon this Quickning Power of Christs
<hi>Spirit</hi> or Divinity, in these words, <hi>By
which also he went and preached unto the
spirits in prison: which sometime were
disobedient</hi> &amp;c. The Greek which is
here translated [<hi>By which,</hi>] is rendred
by others [<hi>wherefore:</hi>] <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is as much
as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ideò, saith <hi>Oecumenius,</hi> and so
tis thought that these words bring in
the <hi>Reason</hi> of what was said before. But
there are few that follow this Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
Our own Translation is more
Plain, and more Probable, for those that
are acquainted with the stile of the New
Testament know that [<hi>By</hi>] is the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
signification of the Praeposition
[<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>:] and it is most obvious and ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
to refer the Article [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] to the word
which immediately preceded it, and that
is <hi>the Spirit,</hi> nor have we any reason to
think that it relates to any thing else.
<hi>By this Spirit</hi> Christ did great and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
things after he was risen from the
dead: by this <hi>he went and preached.</hi> But
<hi>to whom? To the spirits in prison:</hi> and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:99329:117"/>
moreover it is added, that these <hi>spirits
were sometimes disobedient, when once the
long-suffering of God waited in the days
of Noah,</hi> &amp;c. This is differently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by Expositors, for 1. some apply
it to those who were Alive before and
at the time of the Floud. 2. Others
understand it of the Souls of the dead.
And what dead these are you shall hear
when I come to inlarge on this head.
3. Others apply it to the Preaching of
the Gospel in the Apostles times.</p>
            <p>I. It is applied to <hi>those who were alive
before or at the Floud.</hi> And here there
are These two Opinions; first, <hi>Arias
Montanus</hi> is singular and by himself,
who holds that the <hi>spirits in prison</hi> were
those that were shut up, and as it were
Imprisoned in <hi>Noahs Ark. Those eight
souls,</hi> as they are called in the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verse,
are these <hi>Prisoners:</hi> they were kept by
God in the Ark, as in Safe Custody.
But this Notion was started merely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there is mention here of <hi>Noahs Ark;</hi>
and the <hi>eight souls saved</hi> by it. This
without doubt gave the rise to this wild
fancy. And besides, there are several
things which may hinder us from enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
it, for 1. it is said, they <hi>were
sometime disobedient,</hi> which we cannot
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:99329:117"/>
apply to any of these <hi>eight.</hi> It is true
we read that <hi>afterwards Cham</hi> proved a
Wicked person, and was justly Cursed
for being so, but this hath no reference
to what was <hi>before.</hi> 2. The <hi>Preaching
to the spirits in prison</hi> here spoken of
was <hi>whilst the Ark was preparing,</hi> but
they were not Imprison'd in the Ark till
it was made and finished: therefore this
passage cannot be understood of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
shut up in the Ark. 3. It appears
from the Context, that this Preaching of
Christ was after his Resurrection, and
consequently can't be meant of any
Preaching to those in the Ark. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
Others understand it of those
sinners of the Old World who lived all
the while the Ark was building, which was
a hundred and twenty years. <hi>The long-suffering
of God waited</hi> thus long on these
<hi>Antediluvian sinners,</hi> who are called the
<hi>world of the ungodly,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 5. These
are <hi>the spirits in prison,</hi> say the Learned
<hi>Grotius</hi> and D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Hammond.</hi> And<note n="b" place="margin">Epist. 99. ad Eucd.</note> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin</hi>
long before had this notion, and
the Venerable <hi>Bede</hi> and <hi>Aquinas,</hi> and
others, borrowed it from him. It is true
Christ may be said to <hi>preach to these by
the Spirit,</hi> that is, the Holy Spirit
strove with these sinners whilst <hi>Noah</hi>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:99329:118"/>
preached to them. This is plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated
in <hi>Gen. 6. 3. My Spirit shall
not allways strive with man.</hi> The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
then did strive with the men of that
Age, though at last the Allmighty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth
that he will put a period to his
Spirits solliciting and striving with them.
But the forenamed <hi>Expositors</hi> understand
these words not of the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi>
but of the <hi>spirit of man</hi> put into him
by God. And accordingly they think
that this phrase of the <hi>spirits in prison</hi>
alludes to those very words. Because
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Peter</hi> was about using a Similitude bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
from <hi>Noahs</hi> time, he makes use,
saith <hi>Grotius,</hi> of the very words of that
History. But then you must note that
he reads not the words as we do, i. e.
<hi>my Spirit shall not strive with man,</hi> but
according to the<note n="c" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

Latin, <hi>My Spirit shall not abide, or
rest with man, or those men.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Hebrew word [<hi>Iadon</hi>] comes
from<note n="e" place="margin">Nadan, vagina.</note> another that signifies a <hi>Sheath</hi> or
<hi>Scabbard,</hi> therefore he renders that place
thus, according to <hi>Xantes Pagninus,</hi> (who

               <hi>My spirit
shall not be detain'd in man as in a Scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard.</hi>
And then the meaning of the
words is, that the spirit of soul which
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:99329:118"/>
I gave and put into man shall not be
useless, and produce no effect, as a Sword
in a Scabbard, which doth nothing of

any longer; for so it follows, v. 7, 13.
This is <hi>Grotius</hi>'s Notion, and he is of
opinion that [<hi>the spirits in prison</hi>] re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to this. And among the Fathers,
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Ierom</hi> favours this Interpretation.
This Criticism is further confirmed (some
think) by observing that the Chaldee
word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which signifies a <hi>sheath,</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
also a <hi>body,</hi> as is evident from <hi>Dan.</hi>
7. 15. And hence perhaps that Rabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
saying,<note n="g" place="margin">Omnia corpora va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginae sunt: beatum illud quod mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ut sit va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gina Legis. <hi>Talm. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedr.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>All bodies are Sheaths:
blessed is that which deserves to be the
Sheath of the Law.</hi> From all these things
put together some infer that the Apostle
here alludes to this Notion, and that <hi>the
spirits in prison</hi> are <hi>Souls sheathed,</hi> shut up,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:99329:119"/>
               <hi>imprisoned</hi> in their bodies. Christ came and
<hi>preached</hi> to these souls. <hi>viz.</hi> the sinners
that lived in <hi>Noahs</hi> days, and he preached
unto them by the Preaching of <hi>Noah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Interpretation is by no means
to be admitted, for 1. This quaint no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Sheath</hi> and the <hi>Body</hi> is a plain
force upon that Text in <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 3.
which is truly and uncorruptly ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
according to the Hebrew, [My
Spirit shall not strive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>] that is, I will
no longer concern my self with these
men, I will give them up to their own
lusts and lewd desires; my Spirit shall
not strive, as formerly, with them, they
shall not be convinced by <hi>Noahs</hi> Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
nor wrought upon by the foresight
of those Judgments which they cannot
but see hang over their heads: and when
I have thus given them up to their own
vile imaginations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will cut them off in
their sins, and bereave them of all hopes
of mercy for the future. This is the
True import of those words, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
all that the foresaid Criticks sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
is nothing to the Text, but is a
mere Distorting and Perverting of it.
2. Suppose this place of Scripture might
be rendred as they have done it, yet who
sees not that it is far from their purpose?
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:99329:119"/>
What likeness is there between a sheath
and a Prison? It must be strong fancy that
perswades a man to think that the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is put here for the former, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
that the words I am now treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of have reference to those in <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis.</hi>
Or, 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, suppose it were so, yet all
we learn from this strange expression is,
that the sinners before the Floud <hi>had
souls in their bodies,</hi> for that is the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
it seems, of the <hi>spirits in prison,</hi>
it is no more then souls in bodies.
4. This phrase might be made use of
with more reason to prove the <hi>Platonick
Praeexistence,</hi> and the Detrusion of souls
into bodies, which they so much talk of.
I wonder the <hi>Platonists</hi> never took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of this Text. Their Hypothesis
cannot be expressed more fully then tis
here. If I were one that favour'd the
Doctrine of <hi>Praeexistence,</hi> I should prize
this place exceedingly: there is none like
it. For the <hi>spirits in prison</hi> are the
souls which are thrust into these Bodies
as into Prisons. For the Body of man
(as they are wont to speak) is but <hi>Ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gastulum
anim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> the Prison or Dungeon
of the Soul: here it is inclosed or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prison'd
as a Sword in a Sheath. And
these Spirits which are thus immersed
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:99329:120"/>
into Humane Bodies <hi>were sometime dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient,</hi>
i. e. they sinn'd in the state
of <hi>Praeexistence,</hi> and therefore are sent
into these bodies, and there Imprisoned.
Thus this place may be alledg'd in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of that Hypothesis; but any man
who duly weighs the scope of the words
may see that they intend no such thing
as this. The Defenders of that opinion
might as well make use of that place,
<hi>Psal. 142. 7. Bring my soul out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
and thence prove that humane souls
are thrust into the prisons of these bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and that These are <hi>the spirits in
prison</hi> meant by our Apostle. But 5<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, that
which unanswerably consounds This O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
(<hi>viz.</hi> that the words are to be
understood of the <hi>Sinners before the
Floud,</hi> and of Christs preaching to <hi>them</hi>
by his Spirit) is this, that the Text
speaks not of something done by Christ
<hi>before</hi> his Resurrection, as his Descent
into hell, when he was dead: but it
speaks of something which Christ did
<hi>after</hi> his Suffering and Resurrection, when
he was indued with an extraordinary pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
therefore it cannot be thus meant.
This is plain from the Context and the
Words themselves, and therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can more powerfully overthrow
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:99329:120"/>
this Assertion then This doth: this
ruines that Opinion without remedy.
Besides, it is said here of those <hi>spirits,</hi>
that they were <hi>sometime disobedient,</hi> as
much as to say, they were not so <hi>then</hi>
when Christ preached to them. But
because this is not a Necessary Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
I will not urge it: for they
might be <hi>disobedient before</hi> and <hi>then</hi> too,
as I willingly grant, and shall have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to say more of it afterwards.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>Others</hi> (seeing the Levity
of this Opinion) though they hold that
by <hi>the spirits in prison</hi> are meant the
sinners that lived before the General De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge
in <hi>Noahs</hi> days, yet they understand
their <hi>being in prison</hi> in another sense:
as thus, Christ by his Spirit in <hi>Noah,</hi>
who is call'd a<note n="h" place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Preacher of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
did once preach to that genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of men who lived before the Floud,
whose <hi>spirits are now in prison,</hi> i. e. in
Hell for their former disobedience. These
spirits were imprisoned in Hell at the
time when S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Peter</hi> wrote this Epistle,
but they were not in that Prison when
Christ preached to them by the Spirit.
The short is, Christ preached to these
men in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> who were in
this infernal Prison in the days of the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:99329:121"/>
Apostles, and have been ever since.
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Peter</hi> speaks of the spirits <hi>now in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
or <hi>then in prison</hi> when he wrote,
not of the spirits in prison when Christ
preached to them. This Interpretation
is approved of by many, but it is very
Harsh and much Forced. For if you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the words fairly and without
straining them, they must necessarily sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
something which Christ <hi>did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to the
spirits in prison.</hi> Now to say, <hi>they were
not in prison</hi> when he <hi>did it to them in
prison,</hi> is Absurd and Ridiculous: at least,
it is Wresting the words, and not taking
them in their Genuine sense which they
appear to us in. And why we should
abandon the Genuine and Plain sense for
a Forced and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ar-Fetched one I can see
no reason at all: therefore this sense
must not have our Approbation, though
it be so generally received.</p>
            <p>II. Others apply it to the <hi>Souls of
the Dead.</hi> And here there is a great
Difference both among those of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
and Protestant perswasion. 1. Some
will have these <hi>spirits in prison</hi> to be the
Souls of those Deceased sinners who lived
before the Floud, and perished in it, and
were sent to Purgatory. 2. The Souls
of all the Saints and Righteous men who
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:99329:121"/>
had been from the beginning of the world
till Christ, are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eem'd by others to be

is <hi>

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> 3. Some interpret
it of the Damned Souls in Hell. Nay
4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>spirits in prison</hi> are the souls of
the Blessed in Heaven, saith another.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> and some other Roman
Catholicks understand this Text of <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory.</hi>
This is the <hi>Prison</hi> wherein the
souls of the Antediluvian sinners were
kept, for these persons were Un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>lievers
and I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>penitent all the time before the
Floud came, but then they believed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented.
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Ierom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Austin</hi> and <hi>Hilary</hi> lean
this way, interpreting the words to This
purpose, that Christ went to deliver
those poor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ouls who, when <hi>Noah</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them, and God patiently expected
their repentance a hundred years, remain'd
Incredulous and Disobedient, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
when they saw the Floud coming
upon them, became very Penitent, and
hated their former evil ways. To these
Christ, being Dead, <hi>went and preached.</hi>
So then in short, the <hi>Prison of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi>
is meant here by the Apostle, and
Christ went perso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>lly down thither, and
preached to the people of that place.
But I answer 1. They must evidently
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:99329:122"/>
prove that there is such a Place and State
as <hi>Purgatory,</hi> otherwise we have no
ground to believe that This Text is
meant of it. For this being but an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
place of Scripture (as all grant)
we cannot lay any stress on it. And
though some of the Fathers seem to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> yet it is to be
remembred that the <hi>Mystery of Iniquity</hi>
began to <hi>work</hi> long before their time, and
it is no wonder that This and other Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Opinions crept into the Church, and
that even some of the most Learned and
Pious men were misled by them, for
they were but Men, and so were liable
to Mistake and Error. 2. The Patrons
of this Opinion hold that Christ <hi>went
personally</hi> to Purgatory, but no such
thing is mention'd here; yea, another
sort of <hi>Going</hi> is expresly named, for it
is said, [<hi>by which,</hi> i. e. by <hi>the Spirit he
went,</hi>] which seems to exclude a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
and Personal Going. 3. How in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
is this opinion with their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of <hi>Purgatory?</hi> for they hold that
those impure souls are sent to be purged
in the other world, who had some Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
yet remaining to undergo, and
who were not sufficiently Purged in this
world. But this was not the case of the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:99329:122"/>
sinners who perished in the <hi>Floud.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was there such a Punishment and
Judgment, and never shall the like be
again. And therefore according to the
notion of these men, those persons were
sufficiently Punished, and there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
left to undergo. And then, as to
their Moral Purgation, if those persons
repented at all, it is reasonable to think
that their Repentance in those unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell'd
circumstances was exceeding Great,
and that it proved on all accounts Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
and Complete. Those <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
were able to cleanse them sufficiently,
so that they needed not to be sent to
these <hi>Purging Flames.</hi> 4. This is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the received opinion of the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> for they are said
to end in a much shorter time. The
Offenders of the Old World had lain
shut up in this <hi>Prison</hi> almost three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
years, according to these mens Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of the Text; and yet it is the
general doctrine of those that assert the
Pains of <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rgatory,</hi> that they are much
sooner over<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that it was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
that these Torments should be
of very long continuance. 5. Why did
Christ go and take the <hi>Antediluvian</hi>
Wretches out of the <hi>Prison of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:99329:123"/>
and none else? For these are only
mention'd here, and we read of no others
any where else. Why did not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
clear that place, and set open the
Prison-doors to all, and make a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Jail-Delivery? Or, will these men
say that none went to Purgatory but
those poor creatures who lived in <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
time? This they will hardly assert. These
and several other reasons may induce us
to believe that by the <hi>spirits in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
are not meant the <hi>souls in Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, some imagine that <hi>Limb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>
Patrum</hi> is meant there by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Peter.</hi> Christ

               </gap>
thence all the Souls of the Saints who
died before his Coming. Some of the
Fathers, as <hi>Athanasius, Ambrose, Cyr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l</hi>
of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and others, interpret the
Apostle's words thus: and it is their
known Assertion that all the souls of

from their bodies, were imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in some Low Place under ground, and
there were detain'd till our Saviour came
and inlarged them. These are the <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
these words, telling us that the
<hi>spirits in prison</hi> wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

               </gap>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:99329:123"/>
were Separate Souls sent to that foresaid
Apartment and Receptacle. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it is said, Christ was <hi>quickned in the
spirit,</hi> he saith this is meant of Christs
Separate Soul: this being <hi>quickned</hi> went
strait way to <hi>Limbo,</hi> to visit the sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
souls there. But 1. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> talks
very wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dly on this point, for the Soul
being Immortal, can't be said to be <hi>quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi>
or <hi>made alive,</hi> and therefore it was
unwarily and groundlesly said by him
that Christs soul was <hi>quickned.</hi> But 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, I
answer to what he and others alledg con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> that there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was such a place for the separate
souls to go to. This, according to those
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is that place
where the souls of the Patriarchs and
Faithfull under the Old Testament were
lodged. But this is a mere Fiction, for
the spirits of the deceased Saints go pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
to Heaven, and are not detain'd
in any <hi>Prison,</hi> much less so Long a time,
before they reach that place of Bliss.
Therefore we ought not to credit the
Romanists, when they tell us with great
confidence, that Christ went and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <hi>Abraham</hi> and the rest of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs
when he left this world, and
that he acquainted them that the work
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:99329:124"/>
of Redemption was finished, and that he
took them up with him to Heaven. Let
them first prove that <hi>there was</hi> such a
<hi>Prison</hi> (for they confess it is <hi>now</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molished,
and hath been ever since Christ,)
and then we shall attend to what they
say, and not before. 3. This Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is faulty, because it is too Wide for
the Text, which refers only to those of
<hi>Noahs</hi> days. Now supposing Christ
preach'd to them in prison, how is it
gather'd from the Text that Christ went
and redeem'd All from that place? And
on the other side, if they assert that
Christ redeem'd only those who were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Floud, it would be proper to
ask how they came to have this Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
above the rest, but it will be hard
to give a Reason of it. So that one
way or other it is Improbable.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there are Others who by the
<hi>Spirits in prison</hi> understand the <hi>Damned
spirits or souls in Hell.</hi> Here I will not
deny that the word <hi>Prison</hi> hath respect
unto the Place of the Damned (as I
shall shew you afterwards:) but that
Christ went into Hell, and Preached
there to the inhabitants of that place,
I am not convinc'd how it can be made
good from This Text<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Though I grant
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:99329:124"/>
that some of the Antient Fathers make
use of this place of Scripture to prove
that Christ descended locally and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally
into those infernal regions. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Augustin</hi> indeavours to prove
it from these very words, and concludes
at last,<note n="k" place="margin">Quis ergo nisi infidelis negaverit fuisse apud inferos Christum? Epist. 99.</note> who but an Infidel will deny
that Christ was in Hell? As for seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Other Writers of the Church, they
are divided in their Comments on this
Text; some think it refers to <hi>Limbus
Patrum,</hi> others to <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and a third
sort conceive it speaks of <hi>Hell,</hi> that place
where the souls of the Wicked and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate
are tormented. This is the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
the Apostle here means, say they.
But how did Christ <hi>preach</hi> to the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
there? This <hi>Preaching</hi> is interpreted
after a different manner: for some say
our Saviour went to Punish and Affright
the devils, to Triumph over the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and to shew himself a Conqueror
over Satan and all the Infernal Powers.
But these men grosly abuse S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Peter</hi>'s
words when they expound them thus,

the Doctor declares he intends no such

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:99329:126"/>
to what he and others before have asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
I will briefly make It good that
the words speak not at all of Christs
going down to Hell, or of his Preaching
there. For 1. These words refe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ring
to the souls of those who lived in <hi>Noahs</hi>
time, what was the reason that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
went into Hell to preach to These
rather then the rest? how came these
despisers of <hi>Noahs</hi> preaching to have this
Priviledge above all other persons, that
Christ should descend to the Infernal Pit
to relieve them particularly? Why did
not the <hi>Sodomit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> and others share in the
like kindness 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, It is here intimated
that the words are not meant of Christ's
Local Descent into hell, for 'tis said he
went <hi>by the spirit;</hi> which signifies ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing, and what that is I have told
you. But I have mention'd this before.
3. It can't be spoken of Christs going
to Hell, because the words are of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that he did after his Resurrection,
as hath been before suggested. The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Apostle's words is this, first
<hi>Christ was put to death,</hi> then he was
<hi>quickned</hi> or rose again, and after that <hi>he
went and preached:</hi> therefore it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
that this Preaching should be
meant of any sort of Preaching to those
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:99329:126"/>
in Hell, unless you will make Christs
Descent into hell follow his Resurrection
from the dead, which was never dreamt
of yet. Let this therefore be remembred,
that the Text speaks of something which
our Saviour did after he was risen from
the dead, and then it must be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
that this is a plain con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>utation
of the Adversaries Opinion. 4. This
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> spoils their Interpretation, for when
'tis said they were <hi>sometime</hi> disobedient,
it is implied (I do not say absolutely
inferred) that they are not so <hi>now.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, (and which shews the vast Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the Judgements of men
on this place) whereas some Protestants
and most Papists think <hi>Hell</hi> is meant here,
<hi>Calvin</hi> believes the contrary, and vouches
<hi>Heaven</hi> to be understood by this word
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is not a <hi>Prison</hi> according
to him, but a <hi>watch-tower;</hi> and so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the word signifies sometimes.

               </gap>
of the Old World very Incent on the

hoped for it and his Coming,
and as it were <hi>Look'd for</hi> these as from
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:99329:127"/>
some <hi>Watch tower.</hi> But I confess I do
not see what reason that Learned Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
had to alter the ordinary Translation
of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and to render it

the Other Translation, and yet
have kept his Interpretation entire. For
what better word could there be to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
<hi>Heaven</hi> then <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as it signifies

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a Hold, a place of Safety,</hi> like
<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, which some ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Abraham's Port or Haven.</hi> Christ
being raisd from the grave went and
preached to the <hi>spirits in safe custody,</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in Heaven: there he declar'd to
them what Great things he had done,
and how he had finished the work of
mans Redemption. As the words before
spoke of Christs <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Resurrection,</hi>
so these of his <hi>Ascension</hi> and <hi>Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
This is the sense of that Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Man, and if he had not alter'd the
usual version of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it
would have done as well. But against
his interpretation, I alledg first his Wave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in the solution of this Text, for in
his <hi>Institutions</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> and upon
the Place, he expounds it of the souls of
the <hi>Faithful,</hi> but in his <hi>Psychopannychia</hi>
he tells us, that <hi>Christ went and preach'd</hi>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:99329:127"/>
               <hi>not only Remission of sins to the spirits
of the Godly, but also Confusion to the
spirits of the ungodly:</hi> thus he takes in
both <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell.</hi> Secondly, to
what purpose did Christ go and preach
to the Saints in heaven, when they could
not but know the certainty of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
by Their being in that place?
It was needless to preach to them what
they knew already. Therefore I can't
see how this word can be applied to <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
But the main thing which hinders
my Assent to his Interpretation is This,
that the words have relation to <hi>Noahs</hi>
days, and the particular people of that
time. Now 1. It is probable that the
greatest numbers of them perished ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly,
as the<note n="o" place="margin">Luke 17. 26. 2 Pet. 2. 5.</note> Scripture, when it speaks
of the sinners of the Old World, doth
more then intimate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> These were so far from
being placed in a <hi>High Watch-tower,</hi> a
place whence they might look for, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
a Saviour, that they were plunged into
the Lowest Abyss of misery and despair.
2. Supposing that people were Saved,
and in Heaven, yet wherefore did Christ,
when he ascended thither, preach to
These rather then others? And why
were These separate souls above all the
rest continually upon their <hi>Watch,</hi> in
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:99329:128"/>
hopes of the promised salvation? I do
not apprehend any ground for this, and
consequently I cannot admit of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.
These are the several Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of those <hi>Expositors</hi> who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the words concerning <hi>the souls of
the deceased.</hi> Now I proceed to the Last
Cla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>is of Interpreters.</p>
            <p>III. Others apply the words to <hi>the
Preaching of the Gospel to unbelievers
in the Apostles times,</hi> understanding by
<hi>the spirits in prison,</hi> the Heathens, and
by Christs <hi>Preaching</hi> to them, his Sending
his Disciples and Apostles to preach to
them.<note n="p" place="margin">Institut. l. 4. c. 30.</note> 
               <hi>Episcopius</hi> and<note n="q" place="margin">Theolog. Christian. lib. 3. cap. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Limborch</hi> are
the men who offer this Interpretation,
and I take it to be the Fairest of all
those which have been named. But yet
as it is delivered by those persons I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
wholly subscribe to it: therefore I
shall only proceed on the main and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
ground which they have laid, and
I shall make bold to add several things
which I find wholly wanting in those
A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>thors Comments, and thereby give
you a perfect resolution of the Text.
First then, the <hi>Spirits</hi> are the same with
<hi>Souls,</hi> and Souls are as much as <hi>Men</hi> or
<hi>Persons</hi> with bodies and souls: so in the
next verse <hi>eight <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>souls</hi> are said to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:99329:128"/>
i. e. <hi>eight persons</hi> who were in the
Ark. This is an usual Synecdoche: as <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
is put for the whole man often<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so
<hi>Soul</hi> or <hi>Spirit</hi> signifies the same. [Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit]
is not always (though most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly)
applied to the Souls of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased,
as some would perswade us. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
men are call'd <hi>Spirits, 1 Tim. 4. 1.
1 Iohn 4. 1, 3. Seducing spirits</hi> are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers,
or persons that seduce. Or, if
you will not grant this interpretation in
these places, yet you must needs grant
that <hi>persons</hi> may be meant by <hi>spirits</hi> as
well as by <hi>souls,</hi> which latter you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deny, if you consult <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. and
several other places, where by <hi>soul</hi> is
meant <hi>a person,</hi> i. e. a man consisting of
<hi>body</hi> and <hi>soul,</hi> or (which is the same
thing) <hi>spirit.</hi> Or, if [Spirits] be meant
of the <hi>Souls of Dead men</hi> properly, then
also there is reason to apply it here,
because they are <hi>Dead in sin,</hi> and they
are as it were destined to <hi>Eternal Death.</hi>
Those who are <hi>Spiritually dead</hi> are rightly
call'd <hi>Spirits.</hi> These <hi>spirits,</hi> i. e. these
<hi>Men</hi> are no other then the <hi>Gentile I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters</hi>
(say the above named Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,)
who lived in the days of Christ
and the Apostles. And because it is said,
they were <hi>sometime disobedient, Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:99329:129"/>
gives this account of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons
all the Gentiles from <hi>Noahs</hi> time,
as one and the same people, (which is
a thing not unusual with the Holy Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s:)
and so when Christ preach'd to
the Gentiles of his time, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
times, he may be said to preach
to the Gentiles of <hi>Noahs</hi> time, who were
a part of the whole body of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.
So that if you ask of him, How
could these people that lived in the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
times</hi> be said to be disobedient
<hi>in the days of Noah,</hi> his answer is, that
the whole race of wicked men is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sfidered
here as one Body, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
what the first and chief of them
did, those that came after them may be
said to have done. These wicked Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
that lived in the Apostles times
are justly said to have been <hi>disobedient
in the days of Noah,</hi> because they were
a part of the whole, and included in the
main Body of sinners. But I question
whether this will be look'd upon by the
Inquisitive as a Satisfactory Resolution.
For my part, I cannot prevail with my
self to think it such, and therefore I
shall anon offer another Interpretation.
Moreover, I most add this, why may we
not understand these words [<hi>who were
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:99329:129"/>
sometime disobedient]</hi> not only of the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> but of the <hi>Iews</hi> also? The
Text (as I conceive) speaks both of
the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>version of <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>red to both these. I see therefore no
reason why the Exposition should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to one only, <hi>viz.</hi> to the <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gan
Infidels,</hi> and such as were aliens from the
Commonwealth of <hi>Israel.</hi> Christ preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to both <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> who
were <hi>heretofore,</hi> or <hi>sometime disobedient.</hi>
The former of these, both under the
Old and New Testament, are noted to
be such, they are complain'd of as a <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </hi>
people. That <hi>forefathers</hi> even
of those who we in the Apostles
days were disobedient, and therefore <hi>those</hi>
may be said to be <hi>sometime disobedient,</hi>
because they are included in their <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers.</hi>
Or rather, this may be meant
of the <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

And as the <hi>Iews</hi> had lived in Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion

Distressed and Wretched. This you
will find to be the Stile of Scripture:
and accordingly the Psalmist saith, <hi>The
Lord despiseth not his Prisoners,</hi> i. e. those
that are in Distress and Misery, <hi>Psal.</hi>
69. 33. And thus That in <hi>Ps.</hi> 79. 11.
may be understood, <hi>Let the sighing of
the Prisoners come before thee.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
he prays, <hi>Bring my soul out of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
Ps. 142. 8. <hi>Soul</hi> is to be taken here

               </gap> is
the very word used by the Septuagint)
for <hi>Calamity or Misery,</hi> and so this is the
like manner of speech with that in the
Text, <hi>The spirits, or souls in prison.</hi> We
pity those poor wretches who are in Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
who can only look through the
Grates, but are denied the liberty of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abroad to help themselves; we rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
their condition very sad and deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
But it is certain that these poor
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ouls who are imprison'd and Fetter'd by
their Sins are in a far worse case, because
Sin is the greatest Bondage. They, like
<hi>Samson, grind in the prison-house,</hi> they
are put to excessive Drudgery and Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
which are so much the Worse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are not Sensible of it. 4. This
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:99329:131"/>
shews their Inability to relieve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
They are as it were in some

                  </gap>ng</hi> and <hi>Close Prison,</hi> whence there
is no delivery without Gods help, and
the special assistance of Divine Grace.
They are shut up in their Dark Cells,
and know not how to free themselves,
<hi>they are so fast in prison that they cannot
get forth.</hi> 5<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> and lastly, As I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
suggested, <hi>Hell</hi> is call'd a <hi>Prison</hi>
in the Stile of Scripture. Thus in <hi>Mat.</hi>
5. 25. to be <hi>cast into prison</hi> is to be
<hi>cast into Hell:</hi> and accordingly the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riack</hi>
Version of the word is <hi>Sheol,</hi> which
is the word used sometimes for <hi>Hell.</hi>
God <hi>cast the Angels down to hell,</hi> saith
S'<hi>Peter,</hi> and immediately he adds that
he <hi>delivered them into Chains of darkness,</hi>
2 Pet. 2. 4. and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Iude</hi> (v. 6.) speaks
after the same manner. <hi>Hell</hi> implys
<hi>Chains,</hi> and that those who are in that
place are <hi>Bound in the house of their
prison.</hi> So Satan is said to be <hi>bound
with a great chain,</hi> Rev. 20. 1, 2. <hi>i. e.</hi>
he was Confined to <hi>Hell;</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
he was <hi>loosed out of that Prison,</hi>
v. 7. Now, Wicked and Ungodly men
are deservedly said to be <hi>in This pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
even before they are actually cast
into it, because they are as sure to be
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:99329:131"/>
there, <hi>i. e.</hi> to be Damned as if they were
actually so. They are as certainly to
be shut up in the <hi>Prison of Hell,</hi> as if
they were now in it. In this sense In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels
and Unbelievers are said to be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
already,</hi> John 3. 18. All wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
sinners are clapt up in the <hi>Prison,</hi>
are consign'd as it were to <hi>Hell,</hi> unless
they hearken to the Preaching of the
Gospel, and Repent, and be Converted,
and so escape the damnation of Hell.
From all these particulars you may be
satisfied how <hi>Fit</hi> an expression this is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how
<hi>Appositely</hi> those <hi>Vnbelievers</hi> and <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
to whom the Gospel was preached
are stiled <hi>spirits in Prison.</hi> I will yet
further observe to you, how the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
delights in This way of expression.
As I have shewd you from thence how
Sinners are <hi>Imprisoned persons,</hi> so I have
This likewise to take notice of from
Scripture, that the Converting of souls
by Christs coming and preaching, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly
set forth to us by <hi>Freeing them
from prison.</hi> Which confirms This no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the Use of this Phrase, that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inners, whilst they are in their Unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
state, whilst they are they are under the
power of their sins are <hi>in prison:</hi> for they
cannot be <hi>taken out</hi> thence, unless they
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:99329:132"/>
had been <hi>in it.</hi> To this purpose we
may observe the prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi>'s words,
ch. 42. v. 7. where describing the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the <hi>Messias,</hi> he makes this the
summ of it, <hi>to bring out the prisoners
from the prison, and them that sit in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
out of the prison house.</hi> And again,
speaking of the blessed design of the
<hi>Messias,</hi> he expresseth it thus, ch. 49.
v. 9. <hi>That thou mayest say to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
Go forth.</hi> And further in ch.
61. v. 1. he introduceth the <hi>Messias</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
declaring with his own mouth, that
he was <hi>sent to proclaim liberty to the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
and the opening of the prison to
them that are bound.</hi> Which (as well
as the former passages) is meant of the
Spiritual Loosing of men from their sins
by the saving coming of Christ, and
preaching of the Gospel, as is evident
from what our Saviour said when he read
these words of <hi>Isaiah, This day,</hi> saith he,
<hi>is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears,</hi>
Luke 4. 21. As much as if he had
said, This is the grand end and purpose
of my appearing in the world, and of
all my undertakings for mankind, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>to set them at liberty,</hi> to <hi>save them
from their sins.</hi> This was long since fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
by the prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> and now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:99329:132"/>
it is accomplished in me at this
time, who speak unto you and preach
the Gospel of Salvation. <hi>I came to seek
and save that which was lost,</hi> I came to
<hi>bless you in turning you from your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,</hi>
I came to rescue you from the
bondage of sin and Satan. This is the
meaning of <hi>opening the prison to them
that are bound,</hi> of <hi>saying to the priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
Go forth,</hi> of <hi>bringing the prisoners
out of the prison house.</hi> We see then
that from the <hi>stile</hi> of this Evangelical
Prophet we are directed to a right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Peters</hi> words, we are
informed that the <hi>spirits in prison</hi> are <hi>men
in their sins.</hi> Jesus by his Spirit in his
Apostles <hi>went and preached</hi> to these Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
he proclaimed Liberty to these
poor miserable Captives.</p>
            <p>And these are <hi>the dead to whom the
Gospel was preached,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 6. A
place of Scripture which hath mightily
puzzled Expositors. D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Hammond</hi> and
others understand by <hi>these dead</hi> the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the Old World: for these were
<hi>dead</hi> (say they) when <hi>Peter</hi> wrote this
Epistle, though they were <hi>alive</hi> when
they were preached to. So that place,
<hi>Ruth</hi> 1. 8. is interpreted, <hi>The Lord deal
kindly with you, as you have dealt with
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:99329:133"/>
the dead,</hi> i. e. my sons and your hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
who are <hi>now dead,</hi> (when <hi>Nao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi</hi>
spoke this to her daughters in law)
but were <hi>alive</hi> when the kindness was
shewd to them. But I have observ'd
before that this is a Strain'd sense, and
therefore where a more Natural one of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
it self we ought to accept of it. The
most Plain and Proper meaning of [<hi>the
dead</hi>] here is that they were dead <hi>at
that very time</hi> when the Gospel was
preached to them. I understand it of <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
death,</hi> which brings <hi>Eternal death</hi>
with it without repentance. The wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
<hi>that liveth in pleasure is dead while
she liveth,</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 6. It is usual to
call Sinners <hi>dead men,</hi> because (as the
same Apostle saith) they are <hi>dead in
trespasses and sins,</hi> Eph. 2. 1. Yea, it
were easie to shew that this way of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was not unusual with the <hi>Gentile Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralists.</hi>
So <hi>the dead</hi> here to whom the
Gospel was preached were such as were
<hi>Spiritually dead.</hi> Otherwise you can't
make sense of the <hi>Reason</hi> or <hi>End</hi> of the
Gospels being preached to them, <hi>viz.
that they might be judged according to
men in the flesh, but live according to
God in the spirit. Castalio,</hi> after his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
way in the like cases, professes that

words. Some tell us that they speak
of Penitent sinners involved in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Ruine, that though they were <hi>judg'd
in the flesh,</hi> i. e. in respect of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
as far as Men can see, yet in their
<hi>Spirit</hi> or Soul they rest, and <hi>live</hi> with
God. But it cannot be proved that the
Apostle here refers to any such Common
Calamity, and therefore this Exposition
is not to be admitted. Others alter it a
little thus, These words (say they) are
added to remove the scandal laid in the
way of Religion by Infidels and Pagans,
who (as you read v. 4.) <hi>thought it strange
that</hi> the Christians <hi>ran not with them to
the same excess of riot, and spake evil
of them</hi> on that account. They censured,
defamed, and even condemned them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were not like themselves.
But though they were condemned as to
their <hi>flesh,</hi> their outward man, yet their
<hi>spirits,</hi> their in ward man obtain'd favour,
and even eternal <hi>life</hi> with God. But
how this is brought in as a <hi>Reason,</hi> as it
is here, [<hi>For, for this cause &amp;c.</hi>] no man
can discover, and therefo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e we cannot
satisfie ourselves with this interpretation
of the place. Others would understand
it thus, <hi>That they might be judged accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:99329:134"/>
to men in the flesh,</hi> i. e. that those
who lived carnally and wickedly might
be damned, and <hi>live according to God in
the spirit,</hi> i. e. that those who lived god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily
and righteously might be saved. But
this is a manifest perverting of the words,
turning the [<hi>but</hi>] into [<hi>and,</hi>] and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
this place speak of two sorts of
persons, when it is most apparent that
it speaks but of one. But now accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Sense I have before propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
the <hi>Reason</hi> in these words is plain,
<hi>viz.</hi> thus, <hi>For, for this cause,</hi> viz. <hi>that
they might be judged according to men
in the flesh,</hi> i. e. that they might pass
a severe Judgement upon themselves, and
mortifie all their sinful lusts, <hi>but live
according to God in the spirit,</hi> i. e.
live new and holy lives, <hi>was the Gospel
preached to those that are dead.</hi> Here
you may observe a clear Antithesis in
the words; <hi>being judged</hi> or condemned
is opposed to <hi>living,</hi> and <hi>flesh</hi> to <hi>spirit,</hi>
and <hi>according to men,</hi> to <hi>according to God.
For this cause the Gospel was preach'd to
them that are dead in sin, viz.</hi> that being
once Converted they may judge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
themselves, and mortisie the flesh,
and die to sin, (as Judging and passing
Sentence are in order to Execution and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:99329:134"/>
putting to Death among men, or <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to men</hi>) but be <hi>Alive to the spirit,</hi>
and walk according to Gods holy laws. So
then these two places mutually explain
each other: <hi>the dead to whom the Gospel
was preached</hi> are the same with the <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
in prison,</hi> to whom <hi>Christ went and
preach'd.</hi> In both places are meant the
<hi>Spiritually dead,</hi> those that are under the
power and dominion of their sins.</p>
            <p>Thus I hope I have fully shew'd who
are <hi>the spirits in prison.</hi> Now it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
that I explain how <hi>Christ went
and preached</hi> to these spirits. The Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
here is not Christ Personal Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but his preaching by his Apostles,
after his Resurrection, yea his Ascension,
at which time he sent his <hi>Holy Spirit</hi>
to them, by which they were enabled
to preach the Gospel to <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.
By which spirit</hi> (for [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] is
as much as [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>]) poured forth on
his Apostles he <hi>preached,</hi> i. e. he caused
them to preach to the Unconverted
world, Jews and Gentiles, who were yet
in their sins. It is rightly said that <hi>He
preached,</hi> because what was done by the
Apostles, Christs Ministers, is said to be
done by Christ himself. And this which
is here inserted, [<hi>he went,</hi>] though
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:99329:135"/>
if is thought by D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Hammond</hi> to be a
mere Expletive, yet it is not so, but hath
its particular weight and import. These
two things, I conceive are suggested to
us by it, 1. the Deputation of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles.
Christ <hi>went</hi> not in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but he may be truly said to have
<hi>gone</hi> by his <hi>Delegates</hi> and <hi>Ministers.
These went,</hi> and that from place to place
to preach the Gospel. I look upon <hi>Eph.</hi>
2. 17. to be a parallel Text with this
which I am insisting on. <hi>He came</hi> (or,
<hi>he went) and preached peace to you who
were afar off, viz.</hi> to the <hi>Ephesians</hi> who
were Gentiles and Idolaters. He <hi>came</hi>
not to these in person, but he <hi>came,</hi> or
<hi>went</hi> by those whom he sent to preach
to them. Thus <hi>he went, and preached
to these spirits in prison.</hi> So more sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
he went to the <hi>Iews,</hi> yea to them
indeed first, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Peter</hi> speaks, Acts 3.
26. <hi>Vnto you first, God having raised
up his son Iesus, sent him to bless you.</hi>
God <hi>sent him</hi> after his Ascension, not
him in person, but Others in his name
to preach repentance, to <hi>turn every one
of them from their iniquities,</hi> as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
in that place. Thus Christ <hi>went:</hi>
he <hi>sent</hi> those who went. 2. This speaks
the <hi>Freeness of the act.</hi> Neither Christ
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:99329:135"/>
nor his Apostles staied till the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
and <hi>Iews</hi> sought for the Gospel, and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
by it, but they <hi>went</hi> to them. them,
they freely offer'd these to them. The
word then is not redundant and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous,
but very Pregnant and Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical.
God offers his grace freely, God
the Father <hi>sends,</hi> God the Son <hi>goes.</hi>
With what Courtship and Unparallel'd
Address did he seek and woe the love
of Sinners whilst he was here on earth?
With what Concernedness and Passion
did he beseech and sollicit the degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
race of mankind? And when he
left this world and went to his <hi>Father,</hi>
behold, he sent his <hi>Spirit</hi> to actuate his
Church, especially his Apostles, whom
he appointed to instruct and convert souls
throughout the whole world. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
them with extraordinary Gifts and
Graces, to make them able to discharge
their office. And accordingly they did
discharge it with great power and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,
with marvellous and unexpected suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.
They <hi>preached to the spirits in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
and that so effectually that they <hi>set
them free from their Imprisonment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here it will be Objected, what is
this to the purpose? what reason have
you to assert that These words speak
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:99329:136"/>
of Christ preaching by his Apostles to
the Unbelievers, both Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
in those times, when as the Text
plainly refers to the days of the Old
World only, for the <hi>preaching to the
spirits in prison,</hi> is said to have been <hi>when
once the long-suffering of God waited in
the days of Noah, while the ark was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring?</hi>
How then can this belong to
the times of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and their
preaching to unbelieving <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles?</hi>
To solve this, I have told you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
that the words do not <hi>altogether</hi>
refer to those <hi>Antediluvian</hi> Transgressors,
but in a Latitude and by way of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
they comprehend all that have <hi>some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
been disobedient.</hi> But because what
the Learned <hi>Episcopius</hi> hath offer'd, <hi>viz.</hi>
that the several generations of the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
are look'd upon as One Body of men,
and in this Large consideration the
Preaching to those who lived in the days
of <hi>Noah</hi> may reach even to them in the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi>
times, because (I say) this may seem
Unsatisfactory, I will offer That which
will abundantly satisfie all persons. It is
this, that in these words there is an <hi>Ellipsis,</hi>
which is a Figure that is commonly made
use of in the Scripture, and therefore
it ought not to seem strange in this

place. That this <hi>Ellipsis</hi> or <hi>Leaving
out of a word</hi> is very frequent, you may
satisfie yourselves from those Writers who
have made it their bufiness to treat of
the Stile and Phraseology of the Bible:
they will let you see at one view what
a number of <hi>Defective speeches</hi> there are
in the Holy Writ. So it is here: and
there being a Defect, a Supplement must
be made. And what is that? The Greek
word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. is to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
before the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; and the words
are to be read thus, <hi>By which he went and
preach'd to the spirits in prison who were
sometime disobedient, as when once the
long-suffring, or patience of God waited
in the days of Noah.</hi> This word [as]
which is a note of Similitude or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison,
being left out in the <hi>Greek,</hi>
ought to be supplied in the <hi>Translation.</hi>
That it ought to be so, to make the
sense entire, will appear by setting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you some places of Scripture (for
I will not trouble you with instances
of the Ellipsis of this particle in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Writers, though I could produce
very many) where this word is left out
in the Original, but is supplied by the
Translators. As in <hi>Gen. 16. 12. Pag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine</hi>
inserts <hi>tanquam,</hi> and reads it thus,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:99329:137"/>
               <hi>He will be as a wild men.</hi> In <hi>Psal,</hi> 11,
1. the Septuagint add <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Latin <hi>sicut,</hi> and our English Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slators
[<hi>as,</hi>] and read the words thus,
<hi>Flee as a bird to your mountain,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that Adverb is not in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew.
In <hi>Psal.</hi> 12. 6. our Translators
thought it requisite to supply the sense
with an [<hi>as,</hi>] though this particle be
not in the Original: for thus they ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the place, <hi>The words of the Lord are
pure words, as silver tried in a furnace,</hi>
&amp;c. In <hi>Ps.</hi> 22. 13. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is Prefixed by
the Seventy, and <hi>sicut</hi> by the Vulgar
Latin, and <hi>ut</hi> by <hi>Pagnine,</hi> and <hi>as</hi> by our
Translators, [<hi>as a ravening and a roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Lion,</hi>] but the Note of Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is omitted in the Hebrew. So in those
words, <hi>My tongue is the pen of a ready
writer, [as]</hi> is implied: wherefore in
<hi>Pagnine</hi>'s Interlineary Version [<hi>ut</hi>] is
added in the margent, to compleat the
sense. I might mention <hi>Gen. 49. 9. Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deh
is a lions whelp,</hi> where [<hi>as</hi>] ought to
be inserted. So in <hi>Cant. 1. 15. &amp; 4.
1. thy eyes are doves,</hi> (for so it is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the <hi>Hebrew,</hi>) the meaning with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt is, [<hi>as doves,] viz.</hi> as doves
eyes. Likewise in <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 11. this
word is left out, for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is supposed to
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:99329:137"/>
answer to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, although this latter be
not expressed by the Inspired Writer.
Lastly, (to name no more, though se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other places might be produced)
the omission of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 4.
is most palpable, and therefore there is
a supply made by our Translators, <hi>All
things continue as they were from the
beginning of the creation,</hi> as if the Greek
were <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, whereas
it is barely <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. You see
then that it hath been thought necessary
to add this word in several places of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scripture. The same necessity is in the
Text which is before us at present. This
word [<hi>as</hi>] being inserted, makes the
sense Clear and Manifest; for this plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shews that there is a <hi>Comparison</hi> here
between what was done in the <hi>Apostles</hi>
days, and what happened in the days of
<hi>Noah.</hi> The Long-suffering of God in
the times of the Apostles, was <hi>like</hi> that
in <hi>Noah</hi>'s age. As Christ the Eternal
Wisdom preached by <hi>Noah</hi> to those
who were <hi>disobedient</hi> before the Floud,
so he did by the <hi>Apostles</hi> to those who
were <hi>such</hi> in their times. As God here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
shew'd an extraodinary Patience
and Mercy towards the people of the
Old World, giving them a sufficient space
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:99329:138"/>
to Repent in, no less then 120 years,
which yet was not Improved by them;
only a few, hearkning to Gods Voice,
were deliver'd and saved by the Ark:
So Christ was pleased to give proof of
his Singular Long-suffering and Kindness
towards the disobedient Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
who lived in the days of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles:
he by these his Messengers offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
grace to those profligate sinners, shut
up and consign'd as 'twere to Execution
and Destruction: yet he went and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Gospel to them, and freely ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
the happy fruits of his Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But the greatest part of them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy
requited his Kindness, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in their Unbelief and Impenitence:
only there was a select number among
them which accepted of the divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and mercy, and was saved. Thus
the <hi>Similitude</hi> or <hi>Comparison</hi> runs. This
word [<hi>as</hi>] being added to the Text,
the sense is obvious and evident, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
was very obscure and uncertain,
notwithstanding what the forementioned
Expositors had said of it. The Text for
want of inserting this <hi>Note of Similitude</hi>
hath led men to several fond Conjectures
and Mistakes (as you have heard;) but
now it is very Clear, and we have not
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:99329:138"/>
made it subservient to any Improbable
and Absurd Opinions.</p>
            <p>This then we are obliged to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of in a special manner, <hi>viz.</hi> how
<hi>These two are Alike,</hi> the Preaching of
<hi>Christ</hi> or the <hi>Apostles</hi> to the unbelievers
of that time, and the Preaching of <hi>Noah</hi>
to the people of the Old World. The
<hi>Likeness</hi> is mention'd in a General way
here: but (to illustrate the words) let
us take a view of the Particulars of it.
1. Here is a parallel between <hi>Him</hi> that
preach'd to those before the Floud, and
<hi>Him</hi> that preach'd to the Heathens and
Jews under the Gospel. Or rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
this is One and the same Person,
<hi>Christ,</hi> the essential Wisdom of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>God blessed for evermore.</hi> This is
He that <hi>preached</hi> to the men of All Ages.
As he spake to the people in <hi>Noahs</hi> time,
so he did the same <hi>afterwards,</hi> and he
spake to the Unbelievers of the <hi>Last
days, Iesus Christ, the same yesterday, to
day, and for ever.</hi> 2. He spoke to both
<hi>by the spirit. By this he went and preached</hi>
to them, and <hi>by this</hi> (even his <hi>Eternal
Spirit</hi>) he hath preach'd to all genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of men ever since the world was.
But 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, this was not an <hi>Immediate</hi>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:99329:139"/>
Preaching, for as the Son of God made
use of <hi>Noah</hi> and his sons to admonish
the sinners before the Deluge, so he
stirr'd up the <hi>Disciples</hi> and <hi>Apostles</hi> to
preach to the Jews and Gentiles in the
primitive times of Christianity. 4. Here
is a Comparison between the <hi>Hearers</hi> as
well as the <hi>Preachers.</hi> As the greatest
part of the men of the Old World were
<hi>disobedient</hi> to <hi>Noahs</hi> preaching, so most
of the Jews and Heathens were <hi>disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient</hi>
to the preaching of the Apostles.
Yet again, as some of the <hi>Antediluvians</hi>
were <hi>obedient</hi> to the Spirit and <hi>Noahs</hi>
preaching, so some of the Others <hi>believed</hi>
and <hi>were converted</hi> when the Apostles
were sent to them. 5. The Parallel is
observable as to the <hi>Effect,</hi> or rather the
<hi>Consequence</hi> of both Preachings: some
Perished, others were Saved. The Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent
and Hardned sinners perished
in the water, but the family of <hi>Noah</hi>
was by the singular mercy of Heaven
rescued from destruction. 6<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, Therefore
the Comparison is too evident in the
<hi>Paucity</hi> of the persons saved on both sides.
This you find particularly taken notice
of. As in <hi>Noahs</hi> days <hi>few, that is eight
souls were saved,</hi> so when Christ came
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:99329:139"/>
and preached by his Apostles and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
those that believed were but a
very small number: <hi>a remnant shall be
saved,</hi> Rom. 9. 27. 7<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, and lastly,
Observe the Analogy between the <hi>Ark</hi>
and <hi>Baptism,</hi> which were the signal at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants
of <hi>Christs Preaching,</hi> the one
in <hi>Noahs,</hi> the other in the <hi>Apostles</hi> days,
This being particularly mention'd here, I
will explain what the Apostle means by
it. <hi>In the Ark,</hi> saith he, <hi>eight souls
were saved by water:</hi> that is, they were
preserved and delivered out of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Deluge: for <hi>saving by water,</hi>
is as much as <hi>saving out of the water:</hi>
as <hi>saving by fire,</hi> (1 Cor. 3. 15.) is
<hi>saving out of the fire.</hi> Or thus, <hi>saved by
water,</hi> may be all one with <hi>being saved
by means of the water, viz.</hi> by the waves
lifting up the Ark, and carrying it aloft,
and so saving them from being overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
The waters of the floud bore up
the Ark, and thereby kept the persons
in it from drowning. <hi>The like figure</hi>
(or Antitype) <hi>whereunto, even Baptism,
doth also now save us,</hi> v. 21. That is, the
holy Ordinance of Baptism <hi>resembleth</hi> the
Ark in the Floud: for as This was the
happy means of <hi>saving Noah</hi> and his
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:99329:140"/>
family, so That was appointed by Christ
under the Gospel to be the blessed instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Salvation. Unless you will
take the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> here for a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Figure</hi> (as it signifies sometimes,
according to the different rendring of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>)
and then the sense is, that <hi>Saving</hi>
is now <hi>by water,</hi> as heretofore it was by
<hi>escaping it.</hi> The Water of Baptism is
now the means of our Safety, as of old
the water of the Deluge was the means
of Destruction. Thus the <hi>Comparison</hi>
holds good in all these particulars. It was
without doubt design'd that one shold
be a <hi>Representation</hi> of the other. I had
reason therefore to insert the Note of
Similitude [<hi>as,</hi>] to give you the true
meaning of the words. And you see there
was <hi>ground</hi> for inserting it, there being
several Examples of the like nature in
the Holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Now then let us read the words, <hi>Christ
hath once suffer'd for sins, being put to
death in the flesh, but quickned by the
Spirit, by which also he went and preach'd
unto the spirits in prison: who sometime
were disobedient, as when once the long-suffering
of God waited in the days of
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:99329:140"/>
Noah, while the Ark was preparing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
few, that is eight souls, were saved by
water. The like figure whereunto, even
Baptism, doth also now save us.</hi> The
plain meaning of all which is This, that
Christ after his Crucifixion was raised from
the dead by the Spirit of God, and by
the same Spirit communicated to the
Apostles he preached the Gospel to
the stubborn Jews and the Idolatrous
Gentiles. And upon this preaching to
them, most of those poor wretches who
were <hi>Shut up</hi> in darkness and ignorance,
who were <hi>Imprisoned</hi> by Satan, and <hi>Bound
with the chain of their sins,</hi> remain'd still
in the same miserable condition, rejecting
the Gospel, and in that were like unto
the <hi>disobedient</hi> sinners in <hi>Noahs,</hi> days, who
refused the preaching of <hi>Noah,</hi> and of
the Spirit by him. But as there were
some, though <hi>a few,</hi> in that age who
attended to that <hi>Preacher of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
and found favour with God, so was
it likewise in the times of the <hi>Apostles
Preaching,</hi> a small company (that is,
<hi>Small</hi> in respect of those who refused
the tenders of Salvation, but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
very <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Numerous</hi>) were
so effectually wrought upon that they
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:99329:141"/>
believed in <hi>Iesus,</hi> and forsook their sins,
being washed from them by the waters
of <hi>Baptism,</hi> which was prefigured by
<hi>Noahs Ark.</hi> This is that which the
words present us with, and it is no other
then the <hi>Great Mystery of Godliness</hi> (as
it is set forth in 1 <hi>Tim. 3. 16.) God
was manifest in the flesh, justified in the
spirit, preached unto the Gentiles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
on in the world.</hi> This is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the words which I have been
treating of, this is the High and Noble
Theme which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Peter</hi> here briefly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth.
Though the Generality of men
(both then and since) refuse the offers
of Grace and Mercy in Christ Jesus, yet
the Preaching of the Gospel is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual
and succes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ess: both in those
first ages of the world, and in these of
late, there have continually been <hi>added
unto the Church such as shall be Saved.</hi>
But because the <hi>Old World</hi> was the
Greatest Example and Instance of Gods
Long-suffering, as well as of the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence
and Refractoriness of sinners,
therefore Gods sparing the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>
afterwards, and sending the Apostles
to Preach the Gospel to them, are very
fitly parallel'd with the <hi>Preaching of Noah,</hi>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:99329:141"/>
and <hi>Gods Long-suffering</hi> towards the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>that time.</hi> The Apostle here, to
give a <hi>Remarkable Instance</hi> of Gods Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
chooses out the <hi>days of Noah,</hi>
a most Polluted and Degenerate Age,
as you will find it decipher'd in <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.
Hence among the <hi>Rabbins, the Age of the
Floud</hi> is used to express the most Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and Prophane generation of men:
for of all sinners those <hi>Antediluvians</hi> are
reckoned to be the Worst and Vilest.
It is like the <hi>Age of the Giants,</hi> noted
among the <hi>Pagans,</hi> especially their Poets.
For this reason S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Peter</hi> particularly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
That Age, and makes the <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Noah</hi> to them to be a Figure and
Representation of <hi>Christ and his Apostles
Preaching</hi> to the sinners of their time.
They that in these days were <hi>disobedient</hi>
and believed not the Gospel, whilst the
Christian Church was building up, are
represented by Those Sinners of old who
believ'd not, whilst the Ark was build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And so likewise, Those that <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved</hi>
in the Apostles times, and were
saved by <hi>Baptism,</hi> were prefigured by
those who in <hi>Noahs</hi> days were saved in
the <hi>Ark</hi> by water. Yea, I am bold to
say, that <hi>Noahs</hi> Preaching to the sinners
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:99329:142"/>
of that first age, is a figure of the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Gospel even to the end of the
world: which was intimated by<note n="y" place="margin">Epist. 99. ad Euo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium.</note> S<hi rend="sup">s</hi> 
               <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin,</hi>
who tells us, that the Age
of <hi>Noah</hi> was a Type of the Ages to
come. Let <hi>Vs</hi> then, on whom the ends
of the world are come, think our selves
concern'd here. <hi>The Long-suffering of
God hath waited</hi> in Our days, calling us
to repentance and Amendment of life.
O that we may not abuse this Patience
of the Almighty, but that we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is too late, attend to the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Christ by his Holy Ministers, and
by his Sacred Spirit in our hearts, and
that we may be willing to <hi>come out of
prison,</hi> to leave our sins, in which we
have been Fetter'd, to be set Free, and
to be Saved.</p>
            <p>Thus I have finished the task I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook,
which was to explain this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
