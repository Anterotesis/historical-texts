            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

All the refreshment which the people had vnder Iudges, fighting for them, and rescuing them from their oppressours, was but a shadow and a glasse to looke vnto that rest which is to be found vnder the Messias, who putteth his people in such safetie, that the red Dragon with his power cannot come<note place="margin">Apoc. 12. 9</note> neere to pursue.

Ezra</hi> writing the history of seuen of <hi>Daniel</hi> his weekes, which make fourty nine yeares, is<note place="margin">Dan. 9. 25</note> leading the people to look to the end when shall come the holy One, who shall make an end of sin, and finish transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting righteonsnes. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> goeth on in the same course, writing the history of seuenty yeares. In the eighteen yeares history of <hi>Esther,</hi> is it not remarkable to this pùr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that while as the sword was aboue the heads of the people of God, ready drawne as it were, to cut off their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,<note place="margin">Esther 7</note> 
               <hi>Esther</hi> is raised vp as a comfortable instrument of their deliuery. So when the sword of Gods vengeance was drawne, to cut off the whole race of <hi>Adam</hi> with an euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting destruction, in commeth Iesus Christ not looked for of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Angels, nor expected of man, who setteth his people at freedome, and deliuereth them who were subiect to that<note place="margin">Luc. 1. 74.</note> feare. <hi>Iob</hi> was afflicted many wayes in his goods, in his children, in his wife, in his body, in his conscience, yet is his head holden vp, and he kept from despair by the faith which he hath in the Messias, still hoping with the eyes of his<note place="margin">Iob 19, 25. 26. 27</note> soule &amp; body both, to see his Redeemer. When the Prophets come in, is not this the summe of all their Prophecy. He that readeth <hi>Esay,</hi> may read in him all the points of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangell of Iesus Christ.

holding fast the same point. And the nerer they draw to the time of the rising of that bright Star, the more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Malach. 4. 5</note> they spoke of him. So that the last of the Prophets being <hi>Malachie,</hi> his last breath is of Iohn the Baptist, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of Iesus Christ. And so Christ himselfe telleth you that all the Prophets and the Law prophecied vnto <hi>Iohn,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 11. 13</note> and that by <hi>Elias,</hi> of whom <hi>Malachie</hi> spoke, is vnderstood <hi>Iohn.</hi> When the Lord Iesus came himself, all his actions, and especially his sufferings, were the accomplishment of<note place="margin">Math. 17. 1</note> Scripture, which was written of old. Vpon the mountaine of his transfiguration there is seen talking with him <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> to testifie the sweet concent and harmony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him, the Law and the Prophets. And the subiect of<note place="margin">Luc. 9. 31</note> their conference saith <hi>Luke,</hi> was of his death which he should accomplish at Ierusalem. After his resurrection in that powerfull Sermon of his, which made the hearts of the hearers to burne within them. Did he not begin at <hi>Moses</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luc. 24. 27</note> and the Prophets, and expound vnto them in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures these things that were written concerning him, it would take a long time, and fill many pages to goe through all. These few words to them that are wise in the knowledge of God, may be sufficient. Amongst the rest of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, our Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi> (being the last except one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Zach. 3</note> the comming of Christ) he doth most clearely point him forth. He is in this Prophecie that great Angell who taketh the filthy garments from <hi>Iehoshua.</hi> It is he only who taketh from vs the filthy garment of our sin, and cloatheth vs with the white garment of his righteousnes. It is he who putteth wickednes in an Epha, and hath cast a weight of<note place="margin">Zach. 5. 8</note> Lead vpon the mouth of it. For let vs bury our sins where we will, they will rise again, except they be buried in the
<pb facs="tcp:9468:4"/>
buriall of Iesus Christ, from whence they shall neuer rise to our confusion here, nor condemnation after this. He is<note place="margin">Zach. 6. 12</note> that Branch who buildeth the spirituall Temple of GOD. Yea our Prophet is so speciall in his Prophecy of the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias, that he will tell you of his comming in to Ierusalem ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on an Asse. He will tell you of the very price for which<note place="margin">Zach. 9. 9</note> he was sold and betrayed, euen thirty pieces of silver. And<note place="margin">Zach. 11. 13</note> in end he will conclude his Prophecy with making mention of that glorious comming to Iudgment.</p>
            <p>These three Sermons following, are vpon the last three verses of the third Chap. of this Prophet <hi>Zachary,</hi> where. in you shall find excellent Propheticall speach of the Messias. Here haue you his Natiuity, being that Branch of the root of <hi>Iesse.</hi> 2. His suffring, being that Stone which the Lord of Hostes himself did ingraue. 3. The fruits flowing there from, which are, the remouing of sin, peace of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the inioying of all sort of good.</p>
            <p>I was not of purpose that these Sermons should haue seen the light, being conscious of my own insufficiency, neither presuming vpon anything that can flow from me. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouercome by the importunity of a kinde and louing friend, who by accident saw my papers, to whom I could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suse nothing that was lawfull and possible for me, I was content to be requested, yea in a manner commanded. And seeing they must come forth, to whom can they more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belong then to your L. and town of Edinburgh, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my first fruits of this sort. I had with you my birth, I was educat in your schooles of learning, I serued (althogh vnworthy) twenty yeares in your publike Ministry, From which now being remoued, since I can doe you no good by publike preaching, I shalbe glad if by writing, or any other

meanes which lyeth in me, I may proue in any sort stedable. Of these Sermons you were also auditors, they being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the last which I preached there. And so may be best iudged of by you, if they be not the same which were deliuered.</p>
            <p>It may please your L. Baillies and Councill in name of the good Town, to accept this small propine from one of your own, with the like heart and loue wherewith it is offered. Whereby if I shall but rub off me the note of ingratitude, &amp; that your L. doth in any sort like of these trauels, I haue gained what I would, and will be hereby incouraged to vse my pen oftner, that if any good by me can redound vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others, the praise thereof vnder God may be yours, with whom I was bred and brought vp.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Ouing and Christian Reader, I know that the great light and knowledge of this age hath bred itching eares, so that he who will giue foorth any thing in publick, must expect of his travels more carping and censuring, than profiting. The food which in the selfe is wholesome for the soule, being drawne from the pure Word of GOD, is not savorie meat to euery mans taste. They must haue strange sawces to waken their appetite and desire of reading. But let men wander in their conceits, as they please, this remaineth sure, that they who lay not the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Faith in divinity vpon the Scripture, build not vpon the Rock. They who presume to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand aboue that which is written, remember not the Apostles precept, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 13. And they who thinke the Scriptures too shallow to wade in, as not affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding sufficient matter for their wits to worke vpon, sinke in a sea of absurdities and errours. You shall not expect in these Sermons following the large handling of these great common places of divinity, mentioned in the Title, for that you know, would require a large volume. But a plaine opening of the text adhering therevnto without digression. Wherein I will desire you not so much to regard my rude and simple do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as my affection being willing to cast in my myte in
<pb facs="tcp:9468:6"/>
the Church Treasure, the conscience of my doing, being to me a sufficient guard against all calumnies. Thus farre onely I am bold to say, that if you will take paines to reade, you shall finde all that is set downe heere, able to abide the touch-stone of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And if in any thing I haue erred and gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stray (as who can pleade perfection) then I say with holy <hi>Dauid</hi> Psal. 141. 5. Let the righteous smite me, and it shallbee a kindnesse. Let him reproue me, and it shalbe an excellentoyle, which shall not breake my head. The Spirit of GOD leade you in all trueth. Farewell.</p>

               <p>Among the rest of these things which were in the peoples eyes, and occurred to their consideration to discourage them, this was not one of the least: the<note place="margin">Psal. 94 91.</note> present estate &amp; condition of the Priesthood, which had lost all the former glory and dignity, &amp; to them it appeared a thing altogether impossible, that euer their Priest and Priesthood should recouer the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted beautie. To meet with them in their doubtful co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation, and to raise their hearts with comfort in this same particular: There is in the beginning of this chapter, a vision concerning <hi>Iehoshua</hi> their high Priest who althogh he be (as in the vision he is represented) vile and contemptible, partlie in regard of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice<note place="margin">Apoc. 12. 10.</note> of Sathan that pursueth him, partly in regard of his owne pollution and sinnes, which are the mater of Sathans assaults and accusations. Yet is the Lord him<note place="margin">

And in this pleading so prevailing, that Sathan gets the foyle, and is rebuked. <hi>Iehoshua</hi> is made free and absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
<pb facs="tcp:9468:8"/>
His filthy garments are taken from him, a crown for his head, and the ornaments besitting the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood are rendred to him.</p>
               <p>In the Chapter conteining this heauenly &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable vision, there are two chiefe and principall points. The one is the speech of God in the mouth of his Prophet anent <hi>Iehoshua</hi> the high Priest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And the second is the translation of his speech from <hi>Iehoshua</hi> the Type to the great high Priest of the House of God, IESVS CHRIST. Wherein is set down the happy estate and condition of his Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vnder him. But leauing the first part of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, let vs deale with the last three Verses, wherein that which hath beene formerly spoken of the Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Priesthood, to be restored in the person of <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua,</hi> is now declared to haue the accomplishment in the person of Iesvs Christ then to come and now exhibite, of whom <hi>Iehoshua</hi> was the type: for the Lord our God would not haue his people abide or rest in the externall shadow of that ministery, but that in it they should consider what was figured, and looke to IESVS CHRIST who was to come. And heerein may be considered. 1. That the Maiesty and dignity of<note place="margin">1</note> that Priesthood before the captivity was very great. 2. In the time of the captivity, the honour of that<note place="margin">2</note> Priesthood was laid as it were in the dust, and casten to the ground. The visioun representing that time brings in <hi>Iehoshua,</hi> cled in filthy garments, in a base &amp; vile estate. 3. After the captivity, the Lord as a signe<note place="margin">3</note> of his mercifull returne to his people, he restoreth the Priesthood again. And yet neither the glory of Priest
<pb facs="tcp:9468:9"/>
nor Temple was thought answerable to that which was of before.</p>
               <p>Heere therefore comes in the peoples consolation to looke in through all these Types, to the glory and dignity of the Priesthood of IESVS CHRIST to come, with which in dignity and maiesty cannot enter in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parison, the Leviticall Priesthood then standing, &amp; now abolished. 1. The Priest and Priesthood then<note place="margin">1</note> was glorious in their owne forme of glory and splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor:<note place="margin">Heb. 7.</note> But all the glory which they had, was but a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. And the end of it was to point at the glorious Priesthood of IESVS CHRIST. 2. That Priesthood<note place="margin">2</note> with the glory of it, was subiect to alterations and decayes: But the Priesthood of IESVS CHRIST re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines vnchangeable, and is euerlasting. 3. That the<note place="margin">3</note> people should not rest vpon these shadowes, and to comfort them against all mutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s whatsoeuer. There is no solide nor stedfast way but one, looke to IESVS CHRIST. In him, as the Father hath declared, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe<note place="margin">Math. 3. 17. Math. 17. 5.</note> well pleased. So in him only doth the soule of the beleeuer finde sound peace and contentment.</p>
               <p>The Lord our God who typed IESVS CHRIST in the Law, and deliuered him in figures to the people in that Leviticall seruice, althogh he hath remoued the types. And we haue IESVS plainly and simply deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to vs in the Word and Sacraments: Yet remaines there in his Church some teaching of this kinde and nature, wherein by outward, we are led vnto inward, and by earthly, wee are carryed vnto spirituall things. And in things concerning this life, is shadowed vnto vs things eternall, and which concerneth the life that
<pb facs="tcp:9468:9"/>
is to come. The glory of the Temple of old was great But what was it in comparison of the glory &amp; beau<note place="margin">Psal. 45<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2.</note> ty of the spirituall House of IESVS CHRIST, who is fairer then the children of men. The glory and Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty of the high Priest of old was great: but what was it compared with the glory and Maiestie of our high Priest. But these types are away. What remaines yet, and shall remaine in the Church to the end of the<note place="margin">Psal. 19.</note> World, of that kinde of doctrine. Euen thus much. Hast thou any delight or pleasure in the beautifull shape or frame of this World, or any of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that are therein. Should thou rest there? No:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 31. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The glory and Maiesty of earthly<note place="margin">Psal. 49. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But O, how great is that glory, to bee crowned in Heauen, to be cloathed with fine white robes, hauing palmes in their hands in signe of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And all this glorious estate is promised to the<note place="margin">Luc. 12, 32.</note> meanest subiect of the Kingdome of IESVS CHRIST. Bread is comfortable to an hungrie body, but as the hunger of the body may make thee say to him: Lord, giue vs this day our daylie bread: So knowing the<note place="margin">Math. 6. 11 Iohn 6. 32. Apoc. 2. 17.</note> want of thy soule, should thou not run with a petition for it to him, who hath said, I haue hid Manna to giue
<pb facs="tcp:9468:10"/>
you. And of whose House it may be well said, There is in it bread enough, large mercies and comforts to<note place="margin">Lue. 15. 17</note> the hungrie and wearied soule that comes to seeke them. Drinke is good for a thirstie body, but wilt thou not remember of thy soule, and heare him who hath said, I haue drinke to giue, whereof whosoeuer<note place="margin">Ioan. 4. 14</note> drinketh, shall neuer thirst againe. If we haue no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite but naturall, of things concerning the body, what difference betwixt vs and the beast? But a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and renewed man, is he not knowen in his spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall appetite and desires, such as was that man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods owne Heart, expressing his spirituall<note place="margin">Psal. 42. 1</note> appetite this way: As the Hart brayeth for the rivers of waters, so panteth my soule for thee O God. Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are steedable to the naked; But remembring thy soule, heare him who calleth you to come and buy of him garments, to couer your filthy nakednes,<note place="margin">Apoc 3. 18</note> that yee bee not a spectakle of shame in the sight of God, Man and Angell. With which garments whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer shal not be found cled in that Day, shall cry (but<note place="margin">Apoc. 6. 16</note> in vaine) to hils and mountaines to fall vpon them, &amp; cover them from the face of the Lamb. Gold is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, hauing for this life the owne necessary vses; But<note place="margin">Apoc. 6. 18</note> harken to him who hath to giue thee fine gold tryed by the fire, euen that better and induring substance,<note place="margin">Luc. 10. 22</note> which cannot be taken from thee again. So as the Lord led his people of old from things temporall, to things spirituall. and from types to trueth: so let him take vs by the hand, &amp; by him let vs be led from these earthly things, to spirituall things. And fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the things of this life, to the consideration &amp; earnest desire of the better things of that life to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:9468:10"/>There is another word also to bee marked heere, There fell out many changes which were grievous to this people, their owne sins bred them great disquiet. As change in their policie, desolation in their cities, &amp; great change in the face of their Church, &amp; vpon their Priesthood. And when their Temple and Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood was restored againe, it was a griefe to such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred the dayes of old, to see the last no wayes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to the glory &amp; beauty of the first. This do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine therfore proponed by the Prophet, is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them against all such griefs, &amp; to settle &amp; establish their hearts against all changes whatsoeuer, and it is this, cast the eyes of your faith toward IESVS CHRIST the great High Priest to come, and there your soules shall finde rest; IESVS CHRIST who was represented in the figure of the Law, &amp; is exhibit in the fulnes of<note place="margin">1 Tim<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

As he came in the world for this end, to saue sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ners, so is he the only stay of the Hearts of sinners, and in him is perfite remedie against all those griefes and tentations that rise here in this world, by reason of sin to oppresse the hearts of sinners.

a wearyed and distressed body that Christ calleth, saying, Come to me, and I will ease you and refresh<note place="margin">Math. 11. 28</note> you: we would therefore hearken to the sweet call of IESVS CHRIST, and labour to follow the Saints and seruants of God, seeking onely and finding this way contentment to our soules. Heere God by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet willeth his people to looke ouer all that blacke cloud of ceremonies, to IESVS CHRIST.

Therefore as this is noted to be the great sollicitude and care of the Church to inquire for him. Tell mee, O thou whom my soule loueth<note place="margin">Gant. 1. 7.</note> where thou feedest.

               <p>In these three Verses commeth to be considered first the preface that is vsed, next the speech which is deliuered, containing so many excellent points, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Messias, both in his person and office. In

               <p>There is a sort of hearers, who in their hearing are so dainty, whose eares are so itching, and are so continually attending novelty, that if they heare not each day a new tune, a new forme, some new and vncouth point of Doctrine, at least deliuered in an new and vncouth forme: They weary of hearing, and haue no pleasure in it, to whom let this serue for answere.

same thing which thou heard the last day, yet thou hearest euery day a new thing, insomuch as at euery hearing thou gettest sometimes a new exhortation to an old vertue, sometimes a new threatning for an old sinne, a new advertisement to learne the old lessoun of repentance.

               <p>To this attention and hearing are called not only <hi>Iehoshua</hi> himselfe, but the text sayeth, his fellowes that sate before him, for they are men wondred at. By the fellowes of <hi>Iehoshua</hi> may be vnderstood the whole Church and people of God, for all, both Priest and people are called to be auditors of the voice of God, and of this Sermon, the subiect wherof is the <hi>Messias,</hi> in him yee know there is no exception of persons.

Secondly, so heare<note place="margin">2.</note> from GOD, as he who must be Gods mouth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to the people, to deliuer to them evidently and faithfully his Oracles. The people are so to heare and embrace, as there is no way of safety to soule and body, but this which is proponed from the Mouth of God. Let not therefore the Priests say,
<pb facs="tcp:9468:15"/>
It is enough for vs if we instruct the people, and tell them what they should doe; no, thou must sit downe and learne, and heare thy selfe, if thou thy selfe would be saued. Neither let the people say, Let the Priests or the Preachers who haue their maintenance thereby, seeke the knowledge of these mysteries. If thou bee seeking eternall life, to thee it is spoken. Search the Scriptures, it is they that beare testimony of IESVS<note place="margin">Iohn 3. 39 acts 17. 11</note> CHRIST, and in him onely is life to be sought and found.</p>
               <p>By the fellowes of <hi>Iehoshua</hi> may be vnderstood the rest of the Priests that were fellow-labourers with him; And as they come in called to hearing vnder this stile and title of <hi>Iehoshua</hi> his fellowes, it is to tell vs, that albeit <hi>Iehoshua</hi> was high Priest, and in that place a Type of IESVS CHRIST to come, yet hee was not set there, that in pride he should lift vp himselfe aboue his brethren: but remember they were fellowes in that same worke of God with him. The Popish pride is Deuilish, his vsurped singularity he hath not of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> whose successor he will needes be, he calleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe<note place="margin">1 peter 5. 1</note> a fellow elder with the rest. And the Pope will be a god on earth, to giue Law to all the rest. Albeit it may be thought meet for orders cause that some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side in the reformed Church of God, yet they would remember, Presbyters are to them as the rest of the Priests were to <hi>Iehoshua,</hi> of whom it is said, thou &amp; thy fellowes. And three things in this kinde of superiority<note place="margin">1</note> would euer be eschewed. 1.

Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> idlenes, for they are not set there to looke to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and the enlarging of their owne estate, but to looke to the flock and people, which IESVS CHRIST<note place="margin">Acts 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 28</note> hath redeemed by his Blood. That from the Preface we may come to the words themselues, marke the last words, wherein these fellowes of <hi>Iehoshua</hi> are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led men of wonder, or men wondred at. If ye reteine the first interpretation, vnderstanding by the fellows of <hi>Iehoshua,</hi> all the faithfull people of God, then is there heere a certaine description of the Church and people of God, vsed also in other places of Scripture. <hi>Esay</hi> hath it in his eight Chapter, 18 verse.

The renewed man that hath receiued illumination from aboue, wondring to see men with such pleasure and delight, run vpon their owne euerlasting destruction. The day of decision is comming, when these who were heere in the eyes of the World, men wondred at, and of contempt shalbe made in the eyes of these same men, men wondred at for the greatnes of that glory which they shall inioy.

                  </note> being so oft called vpon by the Spirit, to behold this great Mysterie; And in this Mysterie revealed so many great things, ye must not thinke that we are called to an idle contemplation and beholding: But we must so behold him, and looke to him, as we may be blessed in our sight.

                     </gap> Cor. 1. 23 Iohn 0. 27</note> of God. He is in the preaching of the Word, as it were, lifted on his Crosse. Behold him not afarre off, but come neare hand, put thy finger in the hole of his side, in the print of the naile: that is, let thy soule by Faith so rest vpon his mercies and passion, that thou<note place="margin">Iohn 20. 28</note> may say, My Lord, my God, my Savior. He is among you, not that ye should be alienated from him, stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding<note place="margin">Iohn 3. 23</note> afarre off as idle gasess, but come neare hand, and lay thy head in his bosome, I meane not bodily,<note place="margin">1</note> but spiritually this way. First let thy faith rest vpon<note place="margin">2</note> him as the perfite sacrifice for thy sinnes. Secondly, let thy Will, Reason, Iudgement and all, be subiect to<note place="margin">3</note> him. Bring all captiue vnder his obedience. Thirdly, in the day of whatsoeuer griefe, lay thy head in his bosome, that is, rest vpon him. Is thy waters like the waters of Mara, bitter, heere a tree, his crosse, behold<note place="margin">Exod. 15. 25</note> it not afarre off, but take it, and vse it. Cast it in with thy trouble, season it with the meditation of his suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and thy waters shall become sweet vnto thee. In speaking now of the <hi>Messias,</hi> the Lord giueth vnto him two Names; first he calleth him his Servant. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly<note place="margin">1</note> he calleth him the Branch. The first Name,<note place="margin">2</note> the Name of a Servant, is in divers places of Scripture<note place="margin">Esay 11. 42</note> giuen to the <hi>Messias. Esay</hi> eleuenth Chapter, 42. ver. 51. Of which Name giuen to him, there is sundry reasons: First he is so called for his obedience, done<note place="margin">1</note> and performed to his Father. In seruants obedience and sidelity is required, The eyes of the seruants,<note place="margin">Psal. 123<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2</note> (sayeth <hi>Dauid</hi>) are toward their Masters, to wait
<pb facs="tcp:9468:18"/>
vpon their will, and performe their Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. No servant was ever found so faithfull and<note place="margin">Heb. 3. 2</note> obedient to his Master, As IESVS CHRIST this great Servant in the House of GOD was to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obedient, he was euen vnto the death of the<note place="margin">Gen. 22. 9</note> Crosse. The obedience of <hi>Isaac</hi> is commended, that suffered himselfe without resistance to be bound of his Father. But to IESVS CHRIST, of whom <hi>Isaac</hi> was the Type, there needes no bonds. His Fathers will and pleasure was his meat and drinke, he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it was his Fathers will that he should die for the sinnes of his people, most willingly he went to<note place="margin">Iohn 4. 34</note> the Crosse, and protested of his willingnes, saying, No man taketh my life from me, but I lay it downe<note place="margin">Iohn 10. 18</note> 
                  <note place="margin">2</note> willingly. Secondly, he is called the Servant of God, in regard of the assumption of the humane Nature in time, albeit the Sonne of GOD from all eternity, yet made the Servant of GOD in time, because he<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 4</note> was made man, made of a woman, and made vnder the Law. Thirdly, the Servant of GOD, euen for the<note place="margin">3</note> forme and shape of a Servant, which he carried in the time of his exinanition and lurking of his Divinity, of which <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh clearely in the second to the Philippians and 7. verse. And himselfe sayeth, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 7 Math. 20. 28</note> 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chapter, that he came not to be serued, but to serue. This style giuen to IESVS CHRIST would be considered of; first for our consolation, that we may safely &amp; with confidence commit our selues<note place="margin">1</note> vnto him, who for our cause hath vndertaken such seruice, that althogh hee bee now glorious in the Heauens, yet is not this a kinde of Service for vs,
<pb facs="tcp:9468:19"/>
That he interceedes for vs, to whom we may boldlie approach, hauing no need of the seruice and interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion<note place="margin">2</note> of Saints. Secondly it serues for example to vs, that we should learne of Christ to serue, to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, to be obedient, to submit our will to the Will of God, to make his Word, and not our affections, the rule of our service. And it is well said we are servants.<note place="margin">1</note> 1. By the right of creation are we not servants to him,<note place="margin">acts 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 28<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> of whom we haue life and all things necessary. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly<note place="margin">2</note> we are seruants by right of redemption, for we<note place="margin">1 pet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 18. 19</note> being captiue, the Son of God hath redeemed vs, not with the ransome of golde, siluer, or corruptible things, but with his owne precious Blood. Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> we are seruants by right of povertie. Nothing broght<note place="margin">Iob 1. 21 1 Tim. 6. 7 gen. 18. 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 21</note> we with vs in this World, all that we haue is Gods. <hi>Iacob</hi> vowed service to God, if so be he would giue<note place="margin">4</note> him food and raiment. Fourthlie we are servants by right of infirmitie, wee were not able to helpe our selues. CHRIST is become our Counsellour, hee hath learned vs what to doe, he hath instructed vs in that<note place="margin">apo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>. 3. 18</note> which is meet for soule and bodie. Let vs seek to serue and obey him.</p>
               <p>The second name or title giuen to the <hi>Messias,</hi> he is called the Branch. He is so called<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hauing respect to the former Prophecies and promises that were made of him, that it may be knowne he is no other but the same that was fore-prophecied and promised of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, who was to spring and come of <hi>Dauid. Ieremy 23</hi> Thus is it said of him: Behold the dayes come, saith<note place="margin">I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>
                  </note> the Lord, that I wil raise vnto <hi>Dauid</hi> a zealous Branch, a King that shall reigne and prosper, and shall execute
<pb facs="tcp:9468:19"/>
Iustice and Iudgement vpon earth, he shall saue Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, and shalbe called the Lord our righteousnes. The<note place="margin">Esay 53. 2</note> Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> in his 53 Chapter, hath these words of him: Hee shall grow vp as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground. The meaning is, When the family and House of <hi>Dauid</hi> is become so weake,<note place="margin">Esay 11. 1</note> that it is as a dry stock, when all appearance of spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or succession that way is gone, then the Lord mindfull of his promise, and able to performe that which he hath said, makes of the same dry stock this Branch to spring, and makes him as concerning the flesh comming of the Royall race, the most comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table King that euer the World saw.</p>
               <p>But to consider a little of this word the Branch, he is so called for these reasons. First, as a Branch is but<note place="margin">1.</note> a tender and fragill thing, so was he borne in infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, vnder great perill. There was no place to lay him<note place="margin">Luc. 2 7 Math<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. 3</note> in but the Crib, and there is he not free of danger, but his life incontinent sought. Secondly, as somtime<note place="margin">2.</note> contrary our expectation, of a dry stock or roote a branch will bud out, that will flourish and be greene: so did he contrary the expectation of man, bud out of that dryed stock of the house of <hi>Dauid,</hi> a green and a<note place="margin">3.</note> flourishing Branch. Thirdly, because in him, as in a greene &amp; flourishing branch, there doth flourish and spring the flowrs &amp; the fruits of al excellent vertues. And this the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> told of him in his eleuenth<note place="margin">Esay 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2</note> Chapter; The Spirit of the Lord shall rest on him. and it shall flourish this way: The Spirit of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the Spirit of vnderstanding, the Spirit of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, the Spirit of trueth, the Spirit of peace, and all
<pb facs="tcp:9468:20"/>
such excellent vertues. Fourthly, because as a branch<note place="margin">4</note> that hath life in it, groweth and taketh increasse from day to day. So this Branch comming foorth in the World, <hi>Luke</hi> saith of him, As he grew in stature, so hee grew in wisdome, and knowledge, in grace with God<note place="margin">Luc 2. 40</note> 
                  <note place="margin">1</note> and man. Fiftly, although he came out as a small Branch, and was in the eyes of men, of no reputation, yet of a Branch is he become a great tree; and wee as dry and withered branches, are to be transplanted out of the old stock, and by faith be ingraft in him, from whom we draw spirituall life and nourishment. So sayth he himselfe <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. I am the Vine, and yee are<note place="margin">Iohn 15. 56</note> the branches, he that abides in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth fruit.</p>
               <p>In this stile giuen to him, and that the Lord bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him out as a Branch, yee may learne, that if yee looke to the manner of his springing, if ye looke to his outward forme, if ye consider the growth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cresse that he tooke, if ye consider what he calleth vs<note place="margin">Iohn 18. 36</note> to, to be ingraft in him, that we may be fruitfull in our soule; then shall ye easily sea that his kingdome is not<note place="margin">Heb. 1, 2 Psal. 3. 8</note> of this World. Althogh he be the Heire of all, and his Father hath said to him, Aske of me, and I will giue thee the ends and coastes of the earth for thine in he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, yea there is no creature can exeeme it selfe from his subiection. Yet the kingdome that he came to administer heere, is not earthly, but spirituall, the manner of administration is not earthly, but spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, the desires that hee would waken in his owne, is<note place="margin">Col. 3. 1</note> not of earthly, but of spirituall things. The reward that he bringeth with him to his owne is not earthly,
<pb facs="tcp:9468:20"/>
nor of corrupted things, but an incorruptible Crown<note place="margin">Apoc. 2. 8. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> 17. 26. 27 Apoc. 3. 5. 12 21</note> of euerlasting glory, which shall neuer fade away.</p>
               <p>Vses to be made heereof are these. 1. a foolish and<note place="margin">1</note> fleshly conceit of the restitution of their earthly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,<note place="margin">Acts 1. 16 Luc. 24. 11</note> blinded the eyes of the Iewes, and made them mistake the <hi>Messias:</hi> But now the mysterie of the kingdome, being so clearely revealed, our blindnesse must be farre beyond theirs, if we should thinke that Christs comming is to establish an earthly or worldly Monarchie, or to giue his seruants ouer Kings earthly and temporal jurisdiction. Secondly, althogh CHRIST<note place="margin">2</note> ought to bee followed and waited vpon for bodily provision (for the eyes of all things looke to him, and<note place="margin">Psal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 145. 15</note> it is he who satisfieth them.) yet that is not the chiefe thing which is to bee sought in him. It is true that CHRIST allured many to follow after him by these temporall gifts, some he fed, and some he healed. But the end was, that from the earthly, they should be led to the heauenly, and bee mooued to seeke of him a better thing. In the order of the petitions of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite<note place="margin">Math. 8. 9 Luc. 11. 2</note> forme of Prayer which hee hath giuen vs. Hee knowing that we are earthly, yeeldeth as it were this farre vnto vs, that the first petition for our selues is for our daylie bread, but will not haue vs therewith to be content: But remembring hee is a spirituall King, seek the blessing of the Kingdome, seek spirituall grace to thy soule. And so he hath learned thee in the next place to say, Lord forgiue me my sinnes. Thirdly, he<note place="margin">3</note> being a spirituall King, dispensing grace spirituall to his subiects: Then comparison being made, there is no choice, but hee is more worthy to bee followed
<pb facs="tcp:9468:21"/>
then any whatsoeuer. <hi>Moyses</hi> was a Prince, mighty in deed and in word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> worthy to be followed, for in the<note place="margin">Acts 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 22</note> following him, the people were easily fed, they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tilled, nor laboured, but were fed with Manna: but what was that? Our Master CHRIST in his own words will tell you, your fathers did eat Manna, and they died: But he giues vnto vs himselfe, the Bread<note place="margin">Iohn 6. 49 Iohn 6. 35</note> of Life, of which who so eateth, shall liue for euer. <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> the father of the Patriarches, a great Prince; So that the woman of Samaria speaking to IESVS CHRIST, asketh the question, Art thou greater then <hi>Iacob?</hi> what did he? he gaue vs this Well, yes, he<note place="margin">Iohn 4. 12 Iohn 4. 14</note> is greater: for I haue, saith he, water to giue: of which who so drinketh, shall not thirst againe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this point would yet be further consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered CHRIST the Branch, for as heerein is set out the manner of his comming forth, growth, incresse and perfection: So hath this beene also the manner of the beginning, spreading and growing of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome vpon the face of the earth, yea, and in the hearts and soules of his own. Hath he not out of a dry stock, and of no appearances, raised instruments, that of smal beginnings haue brought his kingdome to a mighty growth? And how from small beginnings, the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, which may be called the Chariot of this King, carying him to Nations and Countries, hath gone thorow, is more then evident. And in the hearts of<note place="margin">Math. 13. 31 Marc. 4. 30 Luc. 13. 19</note> his people is not the first beginning of the kingdome of Heauen, comparable to one graine of mustard seed? but afterward groweth as it were, to a great tree so fast rooted, that the hand of the Deuill cannot pull
<pb facs="tcp:9468:21"/>
it forth againe. This is a point serving to these vses. First, think not that it is a kingdome that can be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned<note place="margin">1</note> or overthrown. No, althogh it were broght in appearance to a very stock, yet a branch shall ay bud forth and flourish, euen as of old he made the blood of the Martyrs, the seed of the Church. Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> nourish in thy heart the small seeds of grace, and they were als small as the smallest graine of faith, of loue, water thy heart now and then with the teares of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, seeke from God the dew of Heauen, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and the latter raine, and thou shalt finde thy smal beginnings shall come to a good perfection. Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> seeing this King is so marvailous a worker, that out of a dry stock he can make a flourishing branch to spring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let no greatnes of trouble, or tentation, make thee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to despaire of him, althogh thy eye can not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by what meanes thy deliverance should come:<note place="margin">Ionas 1. 17.</note> He can make a Whale wait vpon <hi>Ionas.</hi> He can make a bush catch a Ram by the hornes in the day of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 22. 13</note> great perplexity. He can open <hi>Hagars</hi> eyes in the wildernesse to see a fountaine of water, when she had<note place="margin">Gen. 21. 19</note> throwne away the child<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> desparing of his life; he that made his Son spring of a dry stock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can make that same rock yeeld waters of consolation for thee. His power is infinite, he is able, his wisdome is infinite, hee can finde out meanes anow, his love is infinite, whereby he is exceeding willing to helpe all that seeke vnto him. Als long as these pillars stand (and they stand vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable) Let vs neuer giue ouer, nor despaire, but let vs vphold and vnderprop our faith in holy pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to await the time of Gods comfort and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.<note place="margin">4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If he regard his neighbours, they are either such as are more neerely conjoyned to him, being of the same family of faith, and heere his faith flourisheth, and bringeth forth brotherly kindnes, or<note place="margin">Iohn 13. 34 Iohn 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17 1 Iohn 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This is a name of strength and solidity, he is a Stone, and a Stone<note place="margin">2</note> laide downe by the hand of GOD himself.

A proper word of the suffrings<note place="margin">3</note> of IESVS CHRIST, whereas his father is brought in saying, And I will ingraue the grauing thereof, sayth the Lord of hostes. 4, The comfortable fruit and<note place="margin">4.</note> effect of his passion, in the remission of sins. I will saith the Lord, remooue the iniquity of the Land in one day. 5.

               <p>We must heere a little examine the reasons of this Name giuen to the <hi>Messias</hi> both in the Old and New Testament, which may be taken vp this way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> First, he is called a Stone, because hee is the maine scope of all Scripture: whatsoeuer was formerly prefigured to the Patriarches by stones or a stone, is in him truely fulfilled and accomplished. We read in the 28 Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note place="margin">Gen. 28. 11</note> of Genesis, of a stone that the Patriarch <hi>Iacob,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weary in his Iourney, laid his head vpon, and slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping there, he saw that heauenly vision of the Ladder, the one end whereof touching the ground, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Was not <hi>Caiphas</hi> and his Priests, the professed builders for the time, and what did they? they reiected with despight, and cast away<note place="margin">Math. 27. 16</note> Iesus Christ, so that <hi>Barrabbas</hi> was of more accompt<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 4</note> in their eyes then he. But in his resurrection hee was lifted vp and declared to bee the chiefe Stone of the building. This same craft and malice of the deuill doth still rage in the world. Is it not to be seene in the Antichristian Church, making them to reiect and cast aside the chief Stone &amp; foundation of the building, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Iesus, and to build vpon the foolish inventions and traditions of men, a building althogh it appeare to rise high, yet shall it be Babell, it shall come to

confusion. Let it be farre from vs to thinke that flesh and blood can bee sufficient for the Church to build vpon. There is no foundation but this pointed by the Finger of God, Behold the Stone that I haue laide, the same is Iesus Christ the Lord.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as the Church in generall is a building<note place="margin">2</note> set vpon this Stone &amp; foundation, so euery member of the Church is a builder. And he would take heed how he buildeth.

                     </gap>. 49</note> Chapter of <hi>Luke,</hi> he saith, that in hearing ye are buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. And as there are two sort of hearers, so is there two sort of builders. And as they differ in the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so the day shall try euery mans building, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans hearing. If ye be idle hearers, ye are foolish builders. Ye must therefore labour to heare so, that in hearing you may be building vpon the Rocke; The day of triall will come, the showres of trouble and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and at last death it self, that will try euery mans hearing, and euery mans building; firme and sure will the estate of that man proue to be: who is founded vpon the Rock, &amp; by faith cleaueth to IESVS CHRIST. The fall of hypocrisie, in the end will be such as there shalbe no more recovery. Let vs build vpon this Rock if we build by faith on him heere, he hath a faire buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for vs in the Heauen. Albeit the outward buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 1</note> of the body be daylie falling downe and decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet wee being builded in the inward Man vpon IESVS CHRIST, we haue assurance of a faire building and house prepared for vs in the Heauens.</p>
               <p>The third reason. CHRIST is called a stone, because he is our onely refuge, our onely comfort and stay in the day of whatsoeuer trouble or tentation. There is<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2, 1</note> no Rocke like our God. The Name of the Lord is a strong towre, and the Righteous runne to it, and are<note place="margin">prov. 11. 11</note> safe.

               <p>Last heere CHRIST in comparing himselfe to a Stone, would recommend to vs three things in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him. 1. humility, a Stone is but an humble and base thing. 2. firmenesse and stability, Be ye so hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that ye be also strong in the faith. 3. Patience, a<note place="margin">Math, 11. 29 1 pet. 5. 9 Coloss. 2. 5 Esay 53. 7 Iam. 5. 7. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> psa. 39. 9</note> Stone will endure much<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and who euer indured so much as he? And was still as a Stone not moued, to learne vs patience vnder the Hand of our God, and in the day of whatsoeuer crosse or trouble, to be silent, and still from murmuring, because hee hath done it. There is a speciall point here, wherein you must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that the comparison holdeth not, and in which we must be most vnlike to stones. For althogh we should be as a Stone in humility, soliditie, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, yet must we not be as Stones in senslesnesse &amp; stupiditie, for all the stones of this building they are<note place="margin">1 pet. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5</note> liuely and sensible of the liuely grace and operation of God. Men senslesse not vnderstanding nor, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, are comparable to stockes and stones. And they who are senselesse of Gods grace, in this day of the dispensation of Gods grace, when it commeth to the day of trouble, or ill tydings, they are as Stones, they
<pb facs="tcp:9468:28"/>
are stupide and confounded, they are voide of resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Their heart within them is as a stone cold and comfortlesse. Ye read of <hi>Nabal</hi> in the first of <hi>Samuel</hi> 25 Chap. In the morning when the wine was out of his head, remembring his former folly, hee became as a<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

We must be as liuely stones, founded vpon the Rock. And let the showres come, and stormes blow, we shall stand<note place="margin">Luc. 6. 48</note> fast, and not be moued.</p>
               <p>And forasmuch as all are stones either vndressed or vnhewen, as we came out of <hi>Adams</hi> quarry, or then dressed, prepared, and made liuely stones of the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding<note place="margin">Math. 3. 9</note> of God. Of the one we are to say, God make of these stones children to <hi>Abraham:</hi> And of the other let him that is once built grow in faith, and be still more holy and righteous, and still grope faster Iesus<note place="margin">Apoc. 22. 11</note> Christ. And as he althogh once very low, yet was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted<note place="margin">psal. 118<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 22</note> &amp; made the head of the corner. So althogh thy estate be base, and thou subiect to great trouble, yet shall this hand who hath placed thee in the building, one day lift thee high, and giue thee a glorious place<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5</note> in that building, whose craftesman and builder is not man, but the liuing God himselfe. Thus haue ye seen the reasons of this Name giuen to the <hi>Messias,</hi> hee is called a Stone.</p>
               <p>The second point is a new kind of picture or figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of this Stone. And it is this, vpon this one stone shalbe seuen eyes. In the Scriptures of God, eyes doe commonly signifie knowledge, wisdome aud vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.
<pb facs="tcp:9468:28"/>
Where wisdome and knowledge is, the eyes of the minde are said to bee illuminate. And where wisdome and vnderstanding is not, they are darkned and put out. It goes in the Scripture for the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a wise man, his eyes are in his head. As the eye<note place="margin">Eccles. 2. 14</note> signifieth knowledge and wisdome: So the number of seuen importeth perfection: so the seuen Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks, and seuen Spirits of God mentioned in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,<note place="margin">Apoc. 1. 4. 12</note> they are the number of perfection. Then the sense goeth this way. Vpon this one Stone the <hi>Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> shalbe seuen eyes, that is, vpon him shall rest, and he shalbe filled with the perfect measure of wisdome &amp; knowledge, and with all the rest of the gifts &amp; graces of the Spirit, for in him is hid and laide vp the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of all heauenly knowledge and wisdome. The Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> speaketh this of him in the eleuenth<note place="margin">Esay 11. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>

                  </note> Chapter. The rod that shall come out of <hi>Iesse,</hi> and the branch that shall spring from that roote, there shal rest vpon him the spirit of wisedome and vnderstanding, the spirit of counsell and might, the spirit of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and of the feare of the Lord. And of this abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance that is in him, the Prophet speaketh in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Song, Psal. 45. God hath anointed thee with<note place="margin">psal. 45. 7, 8</note> the oyle of gladnes aboue thy fellowes, All thy gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments smell of myrrhe, aloes and cassia: he comming forth of his yvorie palace of Heauen, downe to the earth to saue man, there was nothing found in him but a sweet smell and savour of heauenly influence, and of the gifts and graces of the holy Ghost, which he receiued in such fulnes. Look also about this mater to his own words Luc. 4. who being in the synagogue<note place="margin">Luc. 4, 16</note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:9468:29"/>
hauing in his hands the booke of <hi>Esay</hi> his Prophecie, And reading that excellent place, The Spirit of the Lord God is vpon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the Gospell to the poore, he hath sent me to heale the broken hearted, to preach deliverance to the captiues, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at libertie them that are bruised, to preach the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable yeare of the Lord. Hee hauing closed the booke, and the eyes of all that were in the Synagogue being fastned vpon him: hee hath vpon that text this Sermon; This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your eares: that is: I am hee who am come with that ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of graces of the Spirit, whereof <hi>Esay</hi> fore-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied.</p>
               <p>Then this word, vpon a Stone shalbe seuen eyes, would be marked, telling vs first, That the Father sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding CHRIST to so good a turne, to be as he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of before, his Servant in such a weighty busines, as<note place="margin">Col. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And of this great furniture there are two great reasons. First hee had the greatest<note place="margin">1.</note> work in hand and turne to do that euer was or shalbe done in the world. 2. he had many to serue. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooued<note place="margin">2</note> to be an euerlasting fountaine, because the streames thereof were to run to the refreshment of all that should be saued. And of this fulnesse of his we all<note place="margin">Iohn 1. 16</note> do receiue of. This fulnesse that was &amp; is in CHRIST, learne you fully and perfitely to acquiesce in him, as<note place="margin">Cant. 1. 3</note> he who hath fully and perfitely finished the worke of
<pb facs="tcp:9468:29"/>
our redemption. He hath drunke out this Cup, tread<note place="margin">Math. 26. 9 Esay 63. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> forth that Wine-presse, he hath done it himself alone, and there was none to help him, being perfitely filled and replenished from Heauen to doe the turne. Set not <hi>Moyses</hi> nor <hi>Elias</hi> in a Tabernacle with him, Bring not in <hi>Mary,</hi> who her selfe hath need of a Saviour,<note place="margin">Math 17. 4 Luc. 1. 47</note> nor the Saints to be partners with him in this worke. His Father sent him so perfitely furnished, and hee so perfitely hath done the turne, that as the Father hath said of him; He is my welbeloued Sonne in whom I am well pleased. So all that shalbe safe cannot but say,<note place="margin">Math. 3. 17 Math. 17. 5</note> and in him onely my soule hath perfect rest and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.</p>
               <p>2. In this we are also to learne, how the calling of God is neuer fruitlesse nor in vaine, he that sending his Sonne in the flesh to this great turne, so replenish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with the graces of the Spirit, hee sendeth no man to his turne, but hee manifesteth his calling by spirituall vnction, giuing the man whom he sendeth, such measure agreeable, as he seeth meete. And for the greater worke, the greater gifts. The calling by men, may be voide and ineffectuall, the calling of God is not so. Where the gifts are not, although men haue called thee, God hath not called, where the spirituall vnction and gifts are, there is the declaration of the calling of God. 3. There is a lessoun for all men, not to be afraid to goe where God biddeth him: for albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it the way may be hard, &amp; he send thee to great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and affliction, yet will he send no man to vndergoe straitnesse and difficultie without furniture. If God<note place="margin">Exod. 24. 12</note> say to thee with <hi>Moyses,</hi> Come vp the mountaine,
<pb facs="tcp:9468:30"/>
thou mayst come vp vpon his warrant, and enioy good things. If hee bid thee goe off the mountaine<note place="margin">Exod. 32. 7</note> where thou wilt behold things grievous to thy soule, and so change thy estate, thou must also obey, he will be with thee. He that commeth and goeth this way at the direction of God, resting vpon the furniture of God, hee shall one day call him to come vp to that mountaine of glory, from which hee shall neuer des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend,<note place="margin">Math. 25. 34</note> to taste any more of sorrow or trouble.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it would be remembred of vs, that IESVS CHRIST was thus way replenished, that of his fulnes we might all receiue. And so they that would goe to<note place="margin">Heb. 7. 25</note> God. must go to him: And all that would be refreshed<note place="margin">Zach. 13. 1</note> must go to him as the Fountaine. He is that Fountain of the House of <hi>Dauid:</hi> hee was resembled by <hi>Aaron,</hi> whose ointments powred on his head, ran downe to the border of his garments. He co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth in his Church<note place="margin">psal. 133. 2 psal. 45. 8</note> with a faire Priestly garment, all his garments smell of myrrhe, aloes and cassia: To him as to the Fountaine<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 13. 14</note> we are to repaire. By him as our great High Priest, we are to be sprinkled, the sweet savour of his garments<note place="margin">Cant. 1. 3</note> shall allure vs to follow after him, And herein also is a rule of examination for men to try and examine how the garments of Christ, I meane the Crosse of Christ, his death and suffering, and the graces which he hath brought with him, do smell and savour to thee. Hee that wanteth the sense of bodily smelling, althogh there should be broken before him a boxe of the most precious ointment that can be componed, yet hath he no comfort of it. God hath sent forth in his Son to the world, a rich Box of spirituall ointment: And in his
<pb facs="tcp:9468:30"/>
suffring this Box may be said to haue bin broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And yet to the most part of the world wanting the sense to<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 23</note> discerne what is the crosse of Christ, it is but an vnsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory thing. The trial of thy faith is the smell that thou hast of the ointments of Iesus Christ. The Father hath filled him with the oyle of spiritual grace. This Box is broken in the Church, to make it savory to the sons of men. The preaching of the Evangell is the carrying throw of this box &amp; perfume, that it may smel to men. And howsoeuer to the carnal &amp; worldly minded it be an vnsavory thing, yet they that haue faith, are able to<note place="margin">Psal. 45. 8</note> say with <hi>Dauid,</hi> that his garments smell of myrrhe, aloes and cassia. <hi>Isaac</hi> smelled the savour of his<note place="margin">Gen. 27<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 27</note> sonne <hi>Iacobs</hi> garments, as the smell of a field which the Lord had blessed. Thus doth the garments of Christ sweetly smell to the faithfull, who allured with this sweete savour draw neere to him, are blessed of him, and their hearts are lifted vp with the Song of blessing and thankes-giuing to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
               <p>By these seuen eyes may also be heere vnderstood a number finite for infinite of Christian men and women, that with cleare light and sauing knowledge shall see, &amp; by faith embrace &amp; apprehend Christ the <hi>Messias</hi> &amp; Saviour of the world, &amp; in that knowledge of him they shalbe safe.

The man whom CHRIST restored to his sight in the 8 chapt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of<note place="margin">Marc. 8. 22</note> Marke. was restored by degrees.

               <p>The third generall point set down in these words, is about the suffrings of IESVS CHRIST. The word ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing his suffring is this: Behold, I will ingraue the grauing thereof, sayth the Lord of hostes: Which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they be taken by some men, to be spoken of the Nativity of CHRIST, God himselfe being the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat framer and former of his Body, in the wombe of<note place="margin">Math. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20</note> the Virgin, yet they doe most properly concerne his Passion, as appeareth of the wordes immediatly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, subioyned vnto his suffring. The proper effect thereof, which is, to transferre &amp; take away the sins of the people. Of the suffrings of Christ there is heere two words. 1. they were according to the determinat counsell and appointment of his Father: for speaking of them he sayth, I graue the grauing of this Stone. 2. his suffrings were weighty and grievous: if ye consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der first the hand that laide them on, it was the Hand of God, angrie for the sinnes of man. If yee consider next the manner and measure, there was no light nor superficiall doing heere, but it was a profound and deepe sinking and ingraving.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:9468:33"/>As for the first word, albeit in the suffrings of Christ there were many agents and instruments, The Deuils<note place="margin">Iohn 13. 2 Math. 27. 25 Math. 2. 14 Marc. 14. 12 Luc. 22. 7 Math. 26<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 26 Math, 26. 27</note> malice, the Iewes rage, <hi>Iudas</hi> treason, <hi>Pilate</hi> his seeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in yeelding to their vnreasonable desire, the souldiers spight, of whom he suffered many things, yet this remaineth alwayes firme and sure: Nothing befell vnto him but according to the determinate counsell and decree of his Father. The Apostles al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thogh they were a long time very blind in the matter of his Kingdome, and vnderstood not, that his way to triumph was by the Crosse, yet after his ascension hauing receiued according to his promise the Holy Ghost, looke to the testimony that they gaue of his sufferings, in the 4 of the Acts, speaking to God in<note place="margin">Acts 4. 27, 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

That ye may therefore haue comfort in his suffring, heare him tell you, No man taketh my life from me, but I yeeld it heartily, and lay it downe willingly for your sake. It is a great providence of God, that ruleth the worke of his Sonnes suffering, according to his determinate Counsell, that heereby thou may learne to bow the knees of thy soule, and worship him: As GOD almighty, who hauing made man of nothing, was able, when he had lost himselfe, to finde out the way of his safety. 2. As GOD infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 33</note> wise, that found out a way how his iustice might be satisfied, and man also saued, and so you may haue recourse to him still, as that Fountaine of all good, the streames of whose mercie are euer flowing, and can neuer be dryed vp: for heere mayst thou reason with the Apostle.

But let vs consider in this word (Behold I sayth the Lord of hostes, doe graue the grauing of this Stone) The weight and gravitie of the suffering of CHRIST.

               <p>As the gravitie of Christ his sufferings is pointed at in the inflictor, God himselfe, so also in the phrase of speaking, whereby his suffring is imported, it is not a light nor superficiall going over, but a deep sinking and graving so deepe, that of him are the wordes of <hi>Ieremy</hi> to be vnderstood, Consider yee that passe by if<note place="margin">Lament. 2. 12</note> there be any dolour like vnto my dolour.

               <p>The fourth thing mentioned in these verses, is the happy fruite and effect that followeth vpon the suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of IESVS CHRIST; it is expressed this way. I will (sayth the Lord) remoue the iniquity of the Land in one day. The grauing of Christ although painfull to him for a time, yet pleasant and comfortable to his Church for euer. For it is by reason of his sufferings that God his Father hath giuen this declaration, I wil take away and put forth of my remembrance the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and sinnes of all that repent &amp; beleeue in him, his stripes were many, his grauing deep, his sufferings infinite in weight, although not in time. Therefore<note place="margin">Esay 1. 18 Rom. 8. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </note> though thy sinnes were neuer so many, and thy ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities neuer so great, they are all wel payd for. Thou being in him, needest not to feare death, hell, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. In the words expressing this benefite of taking away the peoples sinnes, two things are to bee marked, The one is of the perfection of the worke, All<note place="margin">3</note> sinne and iniquitie shalbe taken away. And the other<note place="margin">2.</note> is of the circumstance of time, in that day. As for the first there is promised heere, the perfect taking away of sin and iniquity. And how doth this agree with the manifold complaints of the Saints in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb facs="tcp:9468:36"/>
of the abiding of iniquitie, and with the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence euen of these who beleeued remission of sinnes, and taking away of iniquities in the Blood of Iesus Christ. Doe not the Saints in Scripture complaine of sinne, cry out vnder the burden of sinne, craving day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the renovation and purgation of their heart. And who hath not reason with <hi>Dauid</hi> to say, If I should<note place="margin">Psal. 40. 12 Psal. 19. 12</note> reckon my iniquities, they are moe in number then the haires of my head, And who knoweth the errours of his life. Hath there beene, and is there manifold sinnes euen in the best children of God? how doth God then performe this promise, saying, that the day of his Sonnes death shalbe a day wherein he will take away all the sin and iniquitie of his people? for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to this. When God is said in Scripture to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the sinne and iniquity of his people two things are imported. The one is, that which hath the proper respect of sinne, which accuseth and condemneth vs before God, the guiltinesse of it, that is taken away. And so to take away sinne, is to forgiue sin, to cover sin, not to impute sin. In the meane time there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in the corrupt nature of man; the mater of sinne, the nourishments of sinne, sinfull concupiscences wherewith the Elect of God haue a daylie strife, not suffring this remnant sin to reigne in their mortal bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Secondly by the words of this promise is impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,<note place="margin">Rom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6. 12</note> that the remission of thy sinnes, that great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite acquired by the death of Christ, is full, absolute and perfect, although the renovation be not as yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. His merite taketh away all the guiltinesse of thy sin, so that thou art free of condemnation, althogh at
<pb facs="tcp:9468:36"/>
the first all corruption be not mortified &amp; slaine into thee. So that both these are the speeches of a renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man: the one of the assurance of faith, there is no<note place="margin">Rom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8. 1</note> condemnation to me: the other of the complaint of sin, the flesh lusteth against the spirit. and this holdeth<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 17</note> them in a continual exercise, striuing to a daylie mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, till in end sin, as it is perfectly forgiuen, so it may be perfectly slaine and abolished, and left as a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case, without motion, life or senses.</p>
               <p>The other worde heere is of the circumstance of time, God saith, he will do this in one day: And the day meant of heere, is the day of the slaughter and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing of his Sonne. It may then bee demanded, was there no remission of sinnes till the day of his<note place="margin">Apoc. 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8</note> death? Is he not that that Lambe spoken of in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalypse 13. that was slaine from the beginning, was not the sinnes of faithfull Patriarches, Prophets, and Servants of GOD taken away in the vertue of that same Blood, althogh the day of the actuall shedding of it was not as yet come? For laying open this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ye must consider about the suffring of Iesus Christ, four things. 1. The ordaining of it by God the Father<note place="margin">1</note> as the mean of mans redemption. 2. the typing &amp; figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring<note place="margin">2</note> of it, by the ceremonies of the Law, &amp; Leviticall<note place="margin">3</note> sacrifices. 3. The merite &amp; efficacie of it. And last that<note place="margin">4</note> very act it selfe, when his body was at Golgotha affix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Crosse. Now althogh this act of his suffring was in the last time, yet in the decree and ordinance of GOD, it was from the beginning. In the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Law, he was typically slain before their eies &amp; the merite and efficacie of his death extended the
<pb facs="tcp:9468:37"/>
selfe to all that was safe from the beginning, and doth extend to all that shall be safe to the end of the world. These words of the promise of taking away sinne and iniquity, being narrowly looked into, you will finde they containe these necessary points that thou must know and beleeue in this comfortable Article of the remission of sinnes, as heere you are led to consider. 1. the Author of the benefite, I will take them away<note place="margin">1.</note> sayth the Lord. Sin being the offence of God, none hath power to forgiue or take away his offence but himselfe. And whereas God is the Author of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite, then hath it these properties. First it is sure. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly<note place="margin">1</note> perfect. Thirdly it is vnchangeable, and neuer<note place="margin">2</note> commeth vnder revocation. Thy memory may forget<note place="margin">3.</note> thy sinnes for a while, and cast them vp againe, thy conscience may loose feeling of them, and cast them vp againe. But if God take them away, they shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer meet thee, neither to thy shame heere, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation after this, A necessary point of tryall for men to examine what way they are made quite of their bypast sinnes: For although thou haue drowned them in oblivion, and put them away in forgetfulnes, yet are they not soundly taken away, till GOD take them away, that thou be able to say, God for Iesus Christ his sake hath forgiuen me them. Secondly, in these words is pointed out vnto vs the meanes, by<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>
                  </note> which, remission of sins is obtained; and that is cleare by ioyning these words with the former. He said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I will graue the Stone, I will sinke it deeply, I will lay great weight of suffering vpon the back of my Sonne. What then shall follow vpon it? this same
<pb facs="tcp:9468:37"/>
gracious effect: I laide this great burden of pain vpon him, that I may take off the great burdens of iniquity. The meane is then whereby remission of sins is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased, his bloody Passion, the grauing of the Stone, his painfull sufferings. If you aske at <hi>Iohn</hi> in his first E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 1. 7</note> and first Chapter, how men are freed of their sinnes, he will answere you, The Blood of Iesus Christ cleanseth vs from all our sinnes. If you aske at <hi>Peter</hi> in<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 18, 19</note> his first Epistle, and first Chapter, how and by what meanes we are redeemed, he will tell you, not with gold nor siluer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but with the precious Blood of the Sonne of God. And if there were no more but this, Sinners are sent to rest vpon Iesus Christ and his Blood, because it is the onelie meane of our reliefe, which GOD himselfe hath devised and found out. I wil, saith he, graue the Stone, and by that meanes take away all thy iniquitie. He that wold present to Gods eye, any other thing meritorious of the remission of his sinnes, but this graven Stone Iesus Christ cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, he must remaine comfortleffe, if it were for no other way but this, he misknoweth that way of his peace, which GOD himself hath devised and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>Thirdly in these wordes of the promise wee are to<note place="margin">3</note> consider of the persons to whom belongeth this great benefite of taking away their iniquitie. And it is heere said, The iniquity of all the Land. A generall to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to the Church and people of God, the eyes of whose faith (as was said of before) shalbe fastened vpon this Stone. Thus saith <hi>Esay</hi> in his 33 Chapter, The people that dwell therein (meaning of the<note place="margin">Esay 33. 24</note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:9468:38"/>

By the Arke of <hi>Noah,</hi> which was a type of the<note place="margin">Gen. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14</note> Church. It was told vs none would bee safe, but they that are within the compasse of the Church. And now the builder of the Church saw this, and<note place="margin">Gen. 9. 27</note> therefore made a good prayer for his son <hi>Iaphet:</hi> God perswade <hi>Iaphet</hi> to dwell in the Tents of <hi>Sem,</hi> that is, make him a member of the Church, to whom this promise is made, I will take away all thy iniquitie. Fourthly, to make this comfort that is in the promise<note place="margin">4</note> of remission of sinnes firme &amp; sure, he doth not giue to sin the common word of sin, but hee giueth it a name more expressing the weight of it, and calleth it iniquitie. Wherein he would allure vs to apprehend the comfort of the promise this way. Let no man by reason of his sinne &amp; iniquitie despaire, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidereth these two things. First, It is I saith the Lord of<note place="margin">1</note> hostes, that am the doer, that taketh away iniquity, come and reason with me. Albeit thy sinnes be many and great, is it not easie to mee to take them away. I that said to Light, and to all the rest of the Creatures,<note place="margin">Esay 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 18</note> let them bee.

But how easie was it to the Lord to send him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, when an Angell with a slight came to him, with a coale taken from the Altar touching his lips, &amp; tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling<note place="margin">Lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb facs="tcp:9468:38"/>
of this, who hauing vttered but a few words of remors for his sin, his iniquitie was instantly taken away, his<note place="margin">2</note> soul made ready for the Paradise of God. 2. As look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God the Author of this work, men should not despair. So considering the medicine how pretious it is, how can sinners distrust &amp; go away comfortlesse? here is a stone deeply grauen, much blood shed. And whereas one drop of that precious blood (being the Blood of GOD) might haue bin a ransome for all the world, behold streames of blood flowing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, that thou may euer therein as it were bath thy soule. And although thy sins were neuer so great, yet heere is the medicine so large, it goeth beyond and aboue all. Last<note place="margin">3</note> of all, you would mark here the phrase of speaking v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed heere. I will saith the Lord, take away the iniquity of the Land. In the former Chapter speaking to <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua,</hi> he said to him, I haue caused thy iniquity to passe from thee. God is said to take away our sinnes, when for the merite and suffering of his Sonne, he accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of them as if they had neuer beene committed. And to ingraue this consolation in the hearts of peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and beleeuing sinners, divers phrases, and sundry forms of speeches are vsed by God in Scripture. <hi>Dauid</hi>

I haue put away thy transgressions like a cloude, and thy sinnes like a mist, <hi>Esay</hi> 44<note place="margin">Esay 44. 22</note> Chapter. Clouds and mists which appeare for a time, are by the brightnesse of the Sunne vtterly dispersed. When God looks vpon thee, through the bright Son
<pb facs="tcp:9468:39"/>
of Righteousnesse IESVS CHRIST, all thy sinnes like a mist and cloude goeth away. The King <hi>Ezechiah</hi> saith <hi>Esay</hi> in his 38 Chapt. That the Lord had casten<note place="margin">Esay 38. 17</note> his sinnes behind his backe. That thing a man will not remember nor regardeth not, he turneth away his face from. This is the gracious doing of our God with his people, his amiable face is toward their persons, his back is turned vpon their sinnes. They shall neuer come in his eye, nor be remembred of him. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet<note place="margin">Micah 7. 19</note> 
                  <hi>Micah</hi> in his seuenth Chapter saith. That the Lord casteth the sinnes of his owne in the bottome of the Sea, alluding to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> &amp; his chariots, whom he drowned in the red Sea, so that they were neuer seene againe aliue to trouble his people. So will the Lord drowne in euerlasting oblivion the sinnes of his owne, that they shall neuer meet them to effray or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet them. Heere is then the comfortable fruit of the sufferings of Christ pointed out vnto vs. God himself the engrauer of this Stone hath as it were with his owne finger written vpon his crosse Remission of sins, and taking away the iniquitie of all that beleeue in<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 6</note> him. <hi>Adam</hi> and his wife put forth their hands, and tooke of the fruite of that forbidden tree, wherevpon followed nakednes and shame. Stretch out thy hand, and take of the fruite of this tree, Remission of sinnes, which groweth vpon the Crosse of Iesus Christ. Righteousnes and life eternall shall follow Remission of sinnes, that great and maine benefite earnestly to bee sought for of vs all. For since all are borne sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and liue in sinne, if a man obtaine not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes, it had beene better<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for him neuer
<pb facs="tcp:9468:39"/>
to haue beene borne, or being borne, it had bin better for him to haue beene a beast nor a man: for the death of the beast, is the end of all miserie to it. But the death of a man dying in his sinnes, is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of such miserie and woe as shall neuer haue an end. There is no burden nor weight comparable to the burden of sin that hangeth so fast on, and presseth down. The burden of sicknes, of long and heavie sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 1</note> is a heauie burden. The burden of shame and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominie, a heavy burden, which maketh <hi>Dauid</hi> so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly cry to God in his 119 Psalme, to deliuer him<note place="margin">Ps. 119. 12. 39</note> from that shame which he feared, and his sin had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued. The burden of disdaine and contempt, a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy burden. We are counted, saith the Apostle, the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scowrings of the World. The burden of povertie and<note place="margin">1 Cor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. 13</note> want a heavy burden.

But of all these burdens none of them can compare with the burden of sinne, lying vpon a mans conscience vnpardoned. And that made the Kingly Prophet, laying aside his royaltie &amp; earthly pleasures of his Kingdome, to cry out, Blessed is the man whose sinnes are forgiuen.

They that sow in teares, shall reape in Ioy. Take it therefore<note place="margin">psa. 126. 5</note> and vse it as an vndoubted consolation.

But mark the phrase of the Church heere. It is not they that sow teares, but they that sow in teares, or with teares.

But leauing this of the temporall deliverie, because the speech hath beene hitherto of the <hi>Messias</hi> and his Kingdome. Heere mention is made of the secure and peaceable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of the subiects thereof. And that this may bee the more cleare, comparison is borrowed from the peaceable and quiet estate of subiects dwelling in a temporall and earthly Kingdome, vnder a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and earthly King. The peaceable estate of subiects in a worldlie Kingdome is set out this way. When a man may without harme or interruption, call his neighbour vnder his Vine, and vnder his Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree.
<pb facs="tcp:9468:43"/>
In the dayes of warre or time of oppression of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, men draw apart to holes and holds, and haue not these free meetings. In the dayes or time of pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, neighbour doth not call neighbour, but neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour skarreth with neighbour, yea the friend with his friend, the father with the sonne, the man with his wife. In the dayes or time of famine, neighbour doth hardly call or invite neighbour, lest as the wise Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins<note place="margin">Math, 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9</note> said to the foolish, there bee not sufficient for vs and you both. But heere is the peaceable and happie estate of a Kingdome, when openly without feare, when familiarly without danger, when vnder the vine and figtree, in plentie without scarcitie hauing the Creatures of God, not onely to necessitie, but to dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation a neighbour may invite and call his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and peaceablie enioy the benefite of God. As this is in generall, the description of the peaceable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of the subiects dwelling in a Kingdome, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a King, whom God doth blesse with peace. So haue you a notable example, agreeable to the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription in the Kingdome of <hi>Salomon.</hi> Of which it is said in the first Booke of the Kings, and fourth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, That all Israel from Dan to Beersheba, dwelt safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">1 Kings 4. 18</note> vnder his vine, and vnder his figtree all the dayes of <hi>Salomon,</hi> Before wee come to the translation of this speech, to the Kingdome of Christ, something would be spoken of the comparison, that forasmuch as the Spirit of God doth here borrow and take comparison from the peaceable estate of earthly Kingdomes, to shadow out the peaceable and prosperous estate of the spirituall Kingdome of the <hi>Messias,</hi> that therfore out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb facs="tcp:9468:43"/>
and worldly peace in a worldly and civill king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, is a good thing in it selfe, and a speciall blessing of GOD, he gaue it <hi>Salomon</hi> as a speciall blessing, hee hath bidden men seeke peace, and inquire after it, he hath bidden so far as is possible, keepe peace with all<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 18 Heb. 12. 14</note> men. And it is euen this outward peace which <hi>Dauid</hi> prayeth for to Ierusalem, for the Churches cause, Psal. 122. Peace be within thy walles, and prosperitie within thy palaces. This peace, a benefite it is in it self,<note place="margin">Psal. 122. 7</note> but vnto men inioying it, it is not alwayes a benefite. 1. when men in their peace acknowledge GOD the<note place="margin">1</note> Author of it. Secondly, when the time of peace is a<note place="margin">2</note> time of the flourishing of Religion &amp; vertue. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">3</note> when mens outward peace draweth not vpon them such deadnes and hardnes of heart, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect their inward and spirituall peace with GOD. Surely the peace outward as a good thing in it selfe, so good also to them that inioy it: but because this same peace hath oftentimes drawen with it all these inconvenients, forgetfulnes of God, decay of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, fatnesse of heart and stupiditie: therfore this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peace is such a benefite as the Lord hath not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes seene meete for his Church. But where out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peace hath made her like standing water, putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, he would rather breake her peace, and cast her in affliction, then that her outward peace should make her lose her spirituall life. It is a word that would be<note place="margin">1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> marked and considered of vs this way. First we al seek these outward things so farre as our iudgement or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection apprehendeth them to be good, without lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to God how far they are expedient or inexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
<pb facs="tcp:9468:44"/>
for vs. Peace, prosperity, wealth and health we would haue, &amp; we say, O how good things are these? But none of these things (although good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues) are to be sought absolutely, but in so far, as he who knoweth what is meetest for vs, seeth they may tend to our chiefe well and good. And therefore <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur</hi> hee craueth a moderation of his estate, since in both the extremities, he knew there was danger to his soule, Lord I craue not outward prosperitie and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, for I know the mischiefe of my nature, it may well make me to misknow thee, and I craue that<note place="margin">Pro. 30<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8. 9</note> thou would not tempt me, neither with over-great want, for there my corruption lyeth also at the waite, I feare it make me blaspheme thee. Heere is therefore a good rule of Christian desires, to seeke these things that are absolutely good, absolutely and earnestly, and of this nature is faith, loue, repentance, and such gifts<note place="margin">1 Cor. 22. 31</note> as concerne the Kingdome of GOD. And in other things which are not absolutely good, to lay downe thy desires at the feet of God, that of them his hand may dispense so farre vnto thee, as he thinketh meete forthy well. Secondly, ye would consider heere of his<note place="margin">2</note> outward peace and rest, how dangerous it may proue to them that are not in peace with GOD. Men may haue great outward peace, when in the meane time the very sword of Gods wrath is hanging ouer their heads. In the 1. Chapter of this Prophecie, the Angels are directed to go through the earth, &amp; to search and try what the inhabitants therof are doing. They come<note place="margin">Zach. 1. 11</note> back with their report and say, we haue walked to and fro, &amp; behold all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thogh
<pb facs="tcp:9468:44"/>
they were guilty at that time of spilling much of the Saints blood, yet they thought no more of it, nor if such thing had neuer bin done. But when they are now in ease, in what estate are they with God? <hi>Luc.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 15.</note> 15 verse. I am sore displeased, saith the Lord, with the heathen that are at ease: while they are at ease, the wrath of God is aboue their heads, and therefore let no man in his rest and ease, be drawne from this tryall &amp; examination in what estate he standeth with God, whether vnder his favour or not, otherwise his ease &amp; rest will proue a perilous thing to him. If <hi>Ionas</hi> his gladnes of heart (of whom it is said, he was exceeding glad) had beene in his God, as it was in his gourd, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding faintnes of heart, would not haue ouertaken<note place="margin">Ionas 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6. 7, 8</note> him for the withering of a gourd, the favour of God neuer fadeth nor falleth away. And if men would strengthen their hearts against the feare or sorrow that may come of the many changes that are in a mans life (for what is all but a gourd that groweth vp in a night, and withereth in a night.) Let the ioy and gladnes of thy heart be in thy God, who althogh<note place="margin">Iosh. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5 Heb. 13. 5</note> thy gourd wither, yet he shall not leaue thee, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake thee. Where there is with outward peace, a grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Church, Religion flourishing, the enemies decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and holden downe, we may then looke for, and expect the continuance of it. But where the contrary of these are, the Lord will rather loose our peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he lose his honour, and will rather powre vs, and turne vs from veshell to veshell, then suffer vs to sit still<note place="margin">Ierem. 46. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <pb facs="tcp:9468:45"/>We come now to the translation of this speech. This outward and peaceable estate of the subiects of a peaceable Kingdome, is to forgiue and shaddow out the happie estate of the subiects of this Kingdome of Christ. And of the subiects of the Kingdome. In this comparison foure things are pointed out vnto vs.<note place="margin">1.</note> First their peace and tranquillity, none to molest the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as in a peaceable Kingdome there is none to hinder a man from lying vnder his owne Vine and Figtree.

                  </note> their safetie and protection, they are vnder the shaddow of IESVS CHRIST as vnder the Vine, and vnder the Figtree. Thirdly, their sweet repast and<note place="margin">3</note> feeding figured by the Fig and Vine. And last their<note place="margin">4</note> spirituall friendship and communion among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, figured in the invitation or calling each one of his neighbour vnder the Vine and Figtree. The first is then, to the subiects of this Kingdome of the <hi>Messias,</hi> is promised peace. It was said of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that vpon his graving, should follow the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of sinnes, and taking away the iniquity of his people. Now vpon the remouing of sinnes, followeth peace and quietnes. He whose sinnes are taken away, is iustified, and being iustified, we haue peace with God, Rom. 5.

If he looke behinde him, hath he not matter of feare? for then is the multitude of his by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past sinnes following him like an armie. If he looke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, hath hee not matter of feare? for O how fearefull is death to a man that is not reconciled with God.

But a man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Iesus Christ, and by a true faith ingraft in him, as a branch in the stock. He hath peace within that passeth vnderstanding. When he looketh to God
<pb facs="tcp:9468:46"/>

When he looketh to his sins, they may appeare as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> hoste to follow him, but they shal neuer overtake him. The Lord hath drowned them in the bottomlesse depth of his mercie. When he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth<note place="margin">Micah 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 19</note> to death, death troubleth not his peace, death can no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But by death shall he come to a more full posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 55</note> of his peace, if he looke to the Angels, they are his guard, if he looke to the inferiour creatures, they are his seruants, and in league and covenant with him. And so as it is said heere of the subiects of a peaceable<note place="margin">Heb 1. 14</note> worldly Kingdome. Euery man shall call his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour vnder his Vine, and vnder the Fig-tree, so that man that is a subiect of the spirituall Kingdome of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, he may say: I will lay me downe quietly,<note place="margin">Psa. 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Now for as much as all men are such louers of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall peace, that rather or men dwell vnder a King, and in a Kingdome where there is daylie found bellicous instruments, the trumpet and the drumme, the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the canon, the pitifull cry of them that are
<pb facs="tcp:9468:46"/>
put to the edge of the sword, they would choose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the losse of their commoditie, to goe and dwell where they may haue peace. And many vpon this same respect, haue changed their residence. Let vs learne this point of wisdome for our soule, that we may say rather then we liue vnder the noise of the Law, and thunder of the threatnings of it, the noise of Gods Iudgement, the fearefull cry of our conscience, we will rather goe and choose to dwell in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and bee subiects of this King, where there is such peace and rest. Happie is hee that is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die a subiect of this Kingdome: seek to draw to it, for there is no true rest, peace nor tranquillity but heere.</p>
               <p>The second thing pointed at heere of the subiects of this Kingdome, is their safetie and protection, and that is figured by lying vnder the shadow of a tree, a vine or a fig-tree. As the two former are conioyned. The Lord forgiueth sinne, vpon which followeth ioy and peace of heart, so whom the Lord forgiueth, and to whom he giueth peace, them he taketh as his owne in his protection, so that they rest safely vnder the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of his wings. These the Prophets conioyneth in his 84 Psalme. The Lord is a Sunne and shield to his owne: by the one signifying that he is comfort and<note place="margin">Psal. 84. 11</note> ioy to his owne: and by the other signifying, that he is their safety &amp; protection, all they vpon whom hath shined the beames of the louing countenance of God, &amp; to whom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God hath showne his pleasant face, they<note place="margin">Psa. 4. 6</note> liue vnder his tuition, in security against all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and assaults. The same two, as conioyned, are comfortably expressed in the words of the 27. Psal.
<pb facs="tcp:9468:47"/>
The Lord is my light and my saluation, he hath shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vpon me like a bright Sunne: Then followeth<note place="margin">Psal. 27. 1</note> his security by reason of this divine protection, Who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shall I feare? when the wicked, euen my enemies come against me, they stumbled and fell, though an hoste should come against me, I will not feare, though warre should be raised, yet in this will I trust. He that dwelleth in the secret of the most high, hee shall rest<note place="margin">Psal. 91<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> vnder the shaddow of the Almightie. And to tell how sure this protection is, he bringeth in example of one of the most fearefull &amp; dangerous euils that can come to man, that is, the pestilence. And to expresse the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of it, he giueth it many names, it is called the feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full pestilence, it is called the snare of the Fowler, it is called the feare of the night, and the arrow that slieth by day, And yet there is promised to the man that trusteth in God, safetie and protection in the midst of the rage of the plague. From this particular he would draw a generall, he that resteth in the secret of the most high, he who is a member of this Kingdome of Iesus Christ, he dwelleth in safetie, he lyeth vnder the shadow of his owne tree, free from all sort of euill. But this appeareth to bee against common sense and experience, for they who haue inward peace, haue not alwayes outward quietnes. And the dearest chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God haue beene, and are subiect to great out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mutations and troubles. How standeth this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of their protection and safety from outward euils with their day lie experience in the contrair, may<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:9468:47"/>
put a man in that assurance, that he may say, I can not feare the sword, famine, nor pestilence. For answer to this. The protection of the godly from these out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward euils vnder the shadow of Christ, it standeth in three things. First, they shall feare none of them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,<note place="margin">1</note> none of them shall come neere them, as a<note place="margin">2</note> plague. Thirdly, they shalbe assured of a ioyfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverie<note place="margin">3</note> from them: either they shall not touch thee, or if they touch thee, they shall not harme thee. They shall not harme nor hinder thy abiding heere als long as God hath appointed. Although they take away thy naturall life, they shall not harme thee, they but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten thee to thy happines, and make thee interchange this life with a better.</p>
               <p>Then, he who resteth vnder the shadow of the most high, dwelleth in safety and freedome from all these outward euils. First, because he is voide of the<note place="margin">1</note> feare of them: for this is a sure word, he that feareth God with a sonnely feare, he needeth feare no other thing in the world with that beastlie and slauish feare that tormenteth mens hearts. But he that feareth not<note place="margin">Gen. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 Deut, 28, 67</note> God, euery thing in the world, sometimes the shake<note place="margin">2</note> of the leafe of a tree is fearefull to him. Secondly, in all these outward euils, they are free of feare, because the great feare being taken away, the feare of hell, what needeth a man feare any other thing. Thirdly, a<note place="margin">3</note> man fearing God, and being vnder this shadow, all these outward things he feareth them not, because he is assured none of them can come neere him without the appointment of his heauenly Father. And he will find nothing by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but that which is for his well. For<note place="margin">Math. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 29 30</note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:9468:48"/>
doth not all things worke to the best to them that loue God. Secondly, a man dwelling and resting vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this shadow, he hath safetie and protection, for he is sure no plague can come neere him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That is a sure word of the Psalme. If thou lye vnder the covert of<note place="margin">Psal. 91. 10</note> Gods wings, no plague shall come neere thy Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle. I call a plague, a punishment and vengeance of God for sin, begun here vpon the wicked to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued after this life, &amp; for euer. In this sense no plague can come neere him: Was not this Stone which God laide before <hi>Iehoshua,</hi> deeply grauen and sunken for thy sins, so that God in his Iustice can neuer punish thee for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The pestilence may come neere thee, but it is no plague to thee. The King <hi>Ezechias</hi> had a<note place="margin">Esay 38<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 11</note> pestilentiall byle, yet it was no plague to him, but a sweet messenger to make him turne him to the wall, weep vnto his God, and shed teares for his sins. Fam in<note place="margin">Verse 2 Gen. 42. 1.</note> may come neere to thee, as it did to the house of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> it was no plague to him, it was a messenger to send him to Egypt, where he might learne and consider the marvailous workes of God toward him. Sicknesse may come to thee, as to <hi>Dauid.</hi> it was not to him a<note place="margin">Psal. 41. 3. 4</note> plague, it was a meane to sharpen his prayer, &amp; make him say to his God, Lord be mercifull vnto me, heale my soule, for I haue sinned against thee. And in end death may come neere thee, and a violent death, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Steuen,</hi> but who can say it was a plague to him, when through that death he seeth the Heauens rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy<note place="margin">Acts 7. 56</note> and open to receiue his soule. Thirdly, a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting vnder this shaddow, he dwelleth in safetie, and hath sure and good protection, because if any of
<pb facs="tcp:9468:48"/>
these outward euils or calamities touch him, he is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of one of these two deliueries. First if God haue further to imploy him heere, he can and will giue him temporall deliverie. Is not he Master and Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of all these euils that are evill to the sense of flesh and blood. Although the sword were as neere thy<note place="margin">Gen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 22<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10</note> throate, as the knife was to <hi>Isaac,</hi> when his father <hi>Abraham</hi> was ready to kill him, and offer him a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to GOD: yet if he haue farther to doe with thee, he can say, hold. Although the pestilence were not onely in thy house, but vpon thy body, as it was vpon <hi>Ezechiah,</hi> he can say vnto it, stay. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though<note place="margin">Esay 38. 21</note> thou were brought downe to the gates of death, and of the graue, he can (if he thinke meet)<note place="margin">Psal. 30<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3</note> bring thee backe againe. Secondly, if he be not<note place="margin">2</note> fred and deliuered temporally heere, he is sure of an eternall freedome and deliverie, whereby being perfectly freed of all euill, and all teares wiped from his eyes, he shall enioy the Face of GOD, in his<note place="margin">Psal. 36. 9</note> light, see light with full comfort and contentment for euer. And thus by lying vnder the Vine and the Fig-tree is shaddowed vnto vs, the safetie and protection of the members of this Kingdome of IESVS CHRIST. It is a point would be marked for this cause. First, men seeke many shifts, and vse sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry<note place="margin">1.</note> meanes that they may dwell in safetie, and be free of feare and danger. But seeke where they will, there is no true safetie bur here: he that resteth in the secret of the most high, shalbe sure vnder the shadow of the<note place="margin">Psal. 91. 1</note> Almighty. As for al other starting holes, if God be thy enemy, his hand can draw thee foorth of them. But
<pb facs="tcp:9468:49"/>
out of the clift of this rocke covered by the Hand of God himselfe, the hand of man, nor the power of flesh<note place="margin">Exod. 33. 22</note> and blood cannot draw thee. Then happie is the man who commeth to the resolution of <hi>Dauid,</hi> Who is<note place="margin">Psal, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>8. 31</note> God saue the Lord? and who is a rock saue our God? And can say with him in the 32 Psalme, Thou art my<note place="margin">Psal. 32<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7</note> secret place, Thou preseruest me from trouble, and compassest me about with ioyfull deliverance. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, this same doctrine of Gods protection would<note place="margin">2</note> also be marked and considered of you, forasmuch as there is here some rule whereby to know if you haue beene made partaker of the former great benefite, the spirituall peace that floweth of the remission of sins, whereby you are delivered from the feare of hell, euen if you feare none of these outward euils with a base and servile feare. Where a mans feare is excessiue in outward troubles or calamities, our Master himselfe will thereby iudge of the weakenes of his faith. So that his Disciples being afraid vpon the stormie Sea,<note place="margin">Math. 8. 26. Luc. 8. 25</note> he saith to them, O ye of little faith. But you would discerne here betwixt fleshlie boldnes and presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and godly security in regard of this divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. Some out of a fleshly humor and carnall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, will with great and loftie words, set at defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance all sort of trouble, they care not the sword, they feare not the pestilence, no man, say they, can die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his day. All this as it is but swelling vanity, so haue they no true nor solide comfort in their soule, who are puft vp therewith. But remember that thy security in the midst of these evils must be grounded this way, and goe on by these degrees. First no thing<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  </note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:9468:49"/>
can befall to me of accident, for God is the ruler of<note place="margin">Psal. 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1</note> all, and als long as he hath the guiding (and that will be euermore) I that am his childe, need not to feare. Secondly, nothing can come to me that is euill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause<note place="margin">2.</note> I am Christs, and he will suffer no euill, as euill, to come neere thee. Thirdly, nothing comming to<note place="margin">3</note> me, can separate me from the loue of God in Iesus<note place="margin">Rom. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 38<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 39</note> Christ. The third thing pointed at in these words of the comparison, is the sweet repast that the members of Christ find in him, and this is expressed by two trees, the Fig-tree and the Vine. The one is meat, and the other is drinke, the meat is sweet, the drink is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable. So all the members of Christ haue in him and by him sweet repast and feeding, not onely for necessity, but also for delectation, not onely meat for their hunger, but Physick and medicine for all their sicknesses and diseases. If any man (sayth Christ to the<note place="margin">Apoc. 3. 20.</note> Church of Laodicea) open vnto me when I knock, I will come in vnto him, and suppe with him, and he with me: where by supping is signified two things: First, the great familiaritie of the Christian soule with<note place="margin">1</note> Christ. Secondly, the feeding and nourishment of the<note place="margin">2</note> soule with Christ, and vpon his Passion and merite. Heere by comparison fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earthly things, our feeding<note place="margin">1</note> vpon him is resembled. He is to vs both the Fig-tree and the Vine, meat and drinke. He is compleat and perfite nourishment to the soule. 2. he is to vs the Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree,<note place="margin">2</note> no fruit so sweet to the bodily taste, As the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of Iesus Christ and his merites to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes of sin, is sweet to the soule: he is to vs the Vine-tree. No such strength or refreshment can come
<pb facs="tcp:9468:50"/>
of the Wine to a wearied and languishing body, as is the strength and comfort which commeth of the Blood of Christ to a wearied soule, loadened with the burden of sin. Thirdly, he is to vs the Fig-tree and<note place="margin">3</note> the Vine, both meat and medicine; meate to feed vs, medicine to cure our disease. And therefore vsing this same comparison, the Church saith to him in the second Chapter of the Canticles, Stay me with thy flagons, and comfort me with thy apples, for I am sick of Loue.<note place="margin">Cant. 2. 5</note>
               </p>
               <p>The vses of this point of doctrine are first, Seeke<note place="margin">1</note> thy perfection in Christ onely, and rest vpon him as thy onely and perfect Saviour, in whom is thy perfect nourishment, and all that thou standest in need of: that in so doing thou mayst be able to meet that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Oracle of the Father, sounded from Heauen. As he hath said, he is my welbeloued Son in whom I<note place="margin">Math. 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5</note> am well pleased: so thou mayst say, In him my soule hath perfect contentment and satisfaction. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">2</note> seeing nothing heere that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> concerneth the bodie and nourishment thereof can sufficiently shaddow out the sweetnes that is in CHRIST, and of the food which the soule findeth in him. And seeing he offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth himselfe to you in his Word and Sacraments. Then learne to beleeve, not because we say out of his<note place="margin">Psa. 34. 8 1 Kings 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7</note> Word, it is so: But because you your selues haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted and felt how sweet the Lord is. And as the Queen of Seba comming to see <hi>Salomon,</hi> found her sight to goe beyond all the report that she had receiued: so if you your selues taste, you shall finde the sweetnesse that is in CHRIST, to bee aboue all that is reported
<pb facs="tcp:9468:50"/>
thereof. What sweetnes is in the Cup? None: but they that drinke truely of it can tell, when the soule drinketh by faith the Blood of IESVS CHRIST to the full remission of sins, and perfect reconciliation with God. Thirdly, the sicknesses and diseases of the soule<note place="margin">3</note> are many, but here is medicine for all. Hardnesse of heart a great disease. There is nothing to soften it but this medicine, being bathed in the Blood of IESVS CHRIST that was shed for thy sins. Spirituall sopor and drowsinesse is a great disease of the soule, nothing so powerfull to waken it, as to drinke of this wine, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the Blood of IESVS CHRIST. The too quick and sharpe sense of sinne, is a sicknes in the soule that may make a man very sad and dolorous, there is nothing to restore him but these flagons, this medicine of the death and sufferings of IESVS CHRIST. Ardent thirst and desire to be rid of trouble, yea and sometimes to bee dissolued is a paine in the soule. O but sayth the Church, stay me with thy flagons. In the apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ and his merits, we rest contented with the gratious dispensation of our God.</p>
               <p>Thus they that are members of the spirituall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Christ, they find into him sweet &amp; comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table repast and feeding. And Christ is to them the Vine and the Figtree. And now in the dayes of the preaching of the Evangell, and ministring the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments thereunto annexed, is verified in our sight that which the Church sayth in the second Chapter of the Canticles. The figtree putteth forth her greene figges, and the Vines with their tender grapes, giue a good smell. Arise my loue, my faire one, and
<pb facs="tcp:9468:51"/>
come away. Let vs not shift nor make excuses, but being so fairely invited, let vs come to the Supper of the great King when all things are ready, all that wee<note place="margin">Luc, 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17</note> stand in need of, or may render vs perfite delight. Let each one of vs say with the Church there, and say with the earnestnes of our soule. Lord let vs heare thy<note place="margin">Cant. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14</note> voice, for it is sweet, let vs see thy face, for it is comely. There is a word heere yet that we would be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred of, lest any man should thinke this a doctrine of too great libertie, as thogh we had no more adoe, but come eat of Christs fruite, and no fruit were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>raued of vs, no; As Christ is compared to these trees, so are we also in the Scripture compared to trees, and to the Vinetree, to the Fig-tree, vpon which should grow<note place="margin">Luc. 13. 6 Iohn 15. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> fruit to the glory of him who hath called vs. These two cannot stand nor agree together, that thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest eat of the sweet figs of Christ, and drinke of his comfortable wine. And in his hunger offer him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing<note place="margin">Esay 5. 4 Psal. 69. 21</note> but sowre grapes, in his thirst giue him vineger, and for food gall: that is, to meet all his desires of thy holy conversation with no other thing but with new sins and daylie offences, by which he is continually grieued. Remember therefore the Lord seeketh good fruit of you, as trees planted in his owne garden. If ye be like that fig-tree in the 13. Chapter of <hi>Luke,</hi> that notwithstanding all the paines that is taken vpon it,<note place="margin">Luc. 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6</note> still remaineth barren, and will yeeld no fruit: at last there will passe from him a commandement to cut thee downe: and in what Airth the tree falleth, there<note place="margin">

                  </note> it lyeth. If it fall to the North, it lyeth in the North: if to the South, it lyeth in the South. Looke in what
<pb facs="tcp:9468:51"/>
estate death overtaketh thee, in that same estate shalt thou remaine for euer. If thou fall in the cold North, voide of that warming heat of the consolation of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, in a cold and comfortles estate shalt thou remaine for euer. If thou fall in the warme South, euen in the armes of IESVS CHRIST, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God by him, in that happie estate shalt<note place="margin">Math. 21. 19</note> thou remaine for euer and euer. You read of that cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed figtree in the 21 Chapter of <hi>Mathew,</hi> which hauing a shew of leaues, yet Christ in his hunger could not finde one fig vpon it. There is nothing more grievous and offensiue to God, then the faire leaues of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, wanting all true fruit of godlines, and a curse more grievous is vpon them, who haue great show with no substance, then they who openly make knowne what they are. Let vs labour to bee that in deed, which we are by profession, that being trees in the garden of God, we may be fruitfull. A good fig to a hungry man, is better then ten thousand leaues: So is a good fruite of our profession better and more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, then great ostentation, multitude of words, men hauing the shew of godlines, but denying<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 5</note> the power of the same.</p>
               <p>The last point is, there is here also shadowed and resembled vnto vs the pleasant communion and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship that the members of Christ haue amongst themselues, that as in the peaceable estate of a worldly kingdome, neighbour doth call and invite neighbour vnder the Vine, &amp; vnder the Figtree: So in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Christ there is harmony, there is agreement among the members, and there is sweet and heauenly
<pb facs="tcp:9468:52"/>
communion: Communion of the Saints is an article of the Creed, and I referre it to that place. There is two parts of this Communion. Communion with the head, and communion among themselues. These words of the text are of the last. Again, of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion among the Saints there is also two parts. The one is of the liuing with the liuing: and the other is, of the liuing with the dead. It is of the first of these two that mention is made here. This communion of the liuing with the liuing, standeth in communion of affections, communion of spirituall gifts, and in some cases communion of temporall gifts. As for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of affection, they are all of one heart to God, to Christ, and among themselues. Thus is it said in the<note place="margin">Acts 4 31</note> fourth Chapter of the Acts, That the multitude of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers were all of one heart. And of this it commeth<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 2</note> to passe, that they continually beare the burden one<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 15</note> of another, they mourne with them that are grieued, and reioyce with them that reioyce. 2. When each man communicateth the grace that he hath gotten,<note place="margin">1 Thess. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 11</note> to the well and profite of his neighbour. And this is done when one edifieth another by example, that they may say, I will doe as yonder man doth, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition each one admonishing another, by exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation each one provoking and stirring vp one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnto good, by consolation. A word in season to a<note place="margin">Prov. 25. 11 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>

And this communion is well resembled in this speech, when neighbour calleth neighbour vnder the Vine, and vnder the Fig-tree, that is, each member is a stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
<pb facs="tcp:9468:52"/>
vp of another to come to Christ, and taste of his sweetnes. I reioyced, saith <hi>Dauid,</hi> when I heard neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor cal neighbor, each one saying to another, Let vs go<note place="margin">psa. 122. 1</note> vp to the house of God. And you haue this same man<note place="margin">Psal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 34. 11</note> this way communicating his grace in the 34 Psalme. Come hither, &amp; I shall tell you what God hath done for my poore soule, that is, I shall communicat my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience with you, that ye may taste of the like. There is againe communion of temporall gifts, when accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy power thou helpest the necessity of thy poore brethren. All this proceedeth from co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with God, &amp; he that saith, he hath communion with<note place="margin">1 Iohn 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20</note> God &amp; with Christ, &amp; hath not this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with his members, he is a lyar. To testifie therefore thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with him, keep this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with the Saints, loue all them that loue the Lord Iesus, be carefull not<note place="margin">Math. 18. 6</note> to giue offence to any of these little ones that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to him. Let the word of exhortation to thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be in thy mouth seasoned, so that he may see thou louest him. Let the word of comfort be in thy mouth to a wearied body. That is a singular comfort that a man hath who is of this communion, when he is so heavy and sick, that he can scarce pray himself, yet he may say, I haue the prayers of all the members of this body, and the prayer of Iesus Christ is effectuall for vs<note place="margin">Iohn 17</note> all. Let vs walk in this communion of Saints, that may testifie vntovs that we haue such communion with CHRIST our Head in this life. As when this life is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, we shalbe brought to reigne in glory with him. To whom with the Father and the Holy Spirit be all honour, praise and glory for euer and euer.
