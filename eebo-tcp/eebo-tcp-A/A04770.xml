            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>FTER that the iuſt copie of this
Recantation, good Reader, came
ſundrie times to my handes in
writt, I wes moued at laſt, for the
great benefite of many, to put it in
print, as a worthie monument of Gods mercie
towarde his Church, in iuſtifying the righteous
cauſe thereof, and in condamning the crooked
courſe of all ſortes of adverſaries, and that ſo
plainelie and mightilie, that it can not be denied
bot to be done by the verie fingar of <hi>GOD</hi> him
ſelfe, and not by the witte or policie of man.
For howſoeuer ſome euill affected perſones, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſareis
to Chriſtian Diſcipline, ſurmiſe this
Recantation to haue bene craftelie procured, or
rather violentlie inforced by the policie of the
contrarie partie (as they ſpeake) yet the credite
of the worſhipfull and faithfull witneſſes, yet
aliue, that testifie the trueth hereof by their
hande-writtes and ſubſcriptions, according as
the thing with the haill circumſtances thereof
wes done in their ſight and hearing, as hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:17267:3"/>
truely is ſet downe, plainlie proueth the work
to be of God, and not of man. Which thing as it
ought to mooue the godlie to an earneſt thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing,
for ſo rare &amp; great a benefite: ſo it ſhould
worthilie terrifie the adverſareis of all ſortes,
from further ſtriuing againſt the trueth of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Diſcipline, no leſſe iustified here by their
owne mouth, as it were, then wes Davids inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie
by the mouth of Saul, when he ſaide: Is
this thy voyce, my ſonne David: Thou art more
righteous then I: whiche more cleared Dauid,
and condemned Saul, then if either David him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
or any of his friendes or fellowes, by worde
or writt had taken vpon them to make his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie.
For this recanter wes no meane adverſary
to true Diſcipline, or one of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſorte, but
a chiefe Ringleader, &amp; one that as in ſtyle mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

to the hiest Antichriſtian (if not heatheniſh
after the maner of Flamine and Archiflamine)
digniteis in Scotlande: ſo in will, diligence and

Saul in perſecuting David, againſt their owne
conſciences, they be brought (in Gods righteous
iudgement) at last to ſome tragicall and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

the world to come: which is ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not ſo much in
regard of ſuch graue and learned fathers, as not
of ambition, but through the iniurie of the time,
for holding out euill perſons from thoſe digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
who would make hauoke of the Church, &amp;
for ſtaying the furie of the ſtorme of perſecution
of the brethren, which otherwiſe no doubt would
enſewe, are cotented (being called) for the quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the Church to accept for an interim and
time, till God ſend further reformation, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure

a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temptible miniſteriall ſeruice, making men
to be compted the ofſcourings of the world, and
a lordlie pompeous gouernement like to that of

            <p>As quhair ȝe require quhat became of

and if I had noth preſerued thame, my

rent owt ſum leafes, &amp; deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſic things as maid agains our eſtaite,
and that not without my awn ſpeciall

            <p>As for the bukes quhilk I haif ſet furth,
<pb facs="tcp:17267:7"/>
I haif ſett furth no thing except a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie
vpon the firſt chapter of Paule
to Timothie, quhilk I did direct to the
Kings Maieſtie, &amp; kept no examplar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide

Geddie</hi> gat the ſamyn from the King, and
lent it to M. <hi>Robert Hebpurne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Farther I wrote nothing, but onelie
maid mention in my preface vpon the

Pſyllus, quhilk (being prevented by
diſeaſe) God would not ſuffer me to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe,
and the litle thing that wes done, I
cawſed to deſtroy it.</p>
            <p>And likewayes I haif ſet furth the buke
of Iob with the Apocalypſe, and the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentationnes
of Ieremie, all in verſe, to
be prented in Englande: as for my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
I am not diſpoſed or in abilitie
to writte any thing at this tyme, and if
it pleaſed God I were reſtored to my
health, I wald change my ſtyle as <hi>Caieta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
did at the councill of <hi>Trent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for <hi>Sutcliuins</hi> buke agains the forme
<pb facs="tcp:17267:8"/>
and ordour of the Preſbitreis, ſo farr am
I from being partenar in that warke, that
as I knowe noth the man, nor had neuer
any intelligence of the warke befoir it
was done: ſo if it pleaſe God to giue me
dayes, I will wreit in his contrarie to the
mantenance of the contrarie confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oun.</p>
            <p>Prayes the Brethren to be reconciled
and to be at vnitie &amp; peax with me, and
in toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thair forgiuenes, becaus health
ſufferis me noth to goe over to the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
quhair ȝe are preſentlie aſſembled

<hi>The Declaration of the

Albeit it conteanith litle
or nothing of the Kings awin intention
bot my awin at the tyme of the writting
theirof: and the corrupt intentionnes of
ſic as for the tyme wer abowt the King
and abuſed his minoritie. Of the quhilk
buke and contents thair of compyled by
me at the command of ſum chiefe cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teours
for the time (as is befoir wrettin)
I ſall ſhortlie declair my opinioun, as the

            <p>Firſt, In the hole buke is no thing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:17267:10"/>
but aſſertionnes of lies, aſcribing
to the Kings Maieſtie that quhairof he
was not culpable: For albeit as the tyme
went, his Maieſtie could haif ſuffered
theis things to haif bene publiſhed in his
Realme, ȝit his Maieſtie wes nevir of that
nature to haif revealed ony manes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoun,
or to vpbraid any man with calum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neis,
quhairof thair is a nomber contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

            <p>Secondlie, In the Declaration of the

made of Maiſter <hi>Andro Melvill,</hi> and
his preachinges moſt wrangfullie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
in ſpeciall, as factious and ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
albeit his Maieſtie hath had a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
triall of that manes fidelitie &amp; trewth
in all proceedinges from tyme to tyme.
Trew it is, he is earneſt &amp; zealous, quho
can abyde no corruption (quhilk moſt
vnadviſedlie I attributed to a fyrie &amp; ſalt

<pb facs="tcp:17267:10"/>

            <p>Thair ar contained in that ſecond act

and accuſing the Miniſteris falſlie
of ſedition &amp; other crimes quhairof they
war innocent, as likeways it is wrettin in

is to be extolled, aboue all the powar of
Princes, and them to be brought vnder
ſubiection to the ſamen.</p>
            <p>The ferd acte condemned the Preſbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie
as ane iudgement not allowed by

            <p>As for any vther thing that is contained
in this act agains any order or proceding

that no thing was done by the preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
