            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Short DISSERTATION Concerning the four last Kings of Judah.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>JOseph Scaliger,</hi> amongst others, hath observed some diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in the History of the four last Kings of <hi>Iudah,</hi> viz. <hi>Iehoahaz, Iehoiakim, Iehoiakin,</hi> and <hi>Zedekiah.</hi> Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, he doth this in a short Tract, Intituled, <hi>Iosephi Scaligeri judicium de thesi quadam Chronologica,</hi> (which we have after his <hi>Prolagomena</hi> to his <hi>Canones Isagogici</hi>) in which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, that some studious person would undertake the solution of those difficulties. Many have since endeavour'd it, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly <hi>Lud. Cappellus,</hi> in his Notes upon the twelfth Table of his <hi>Chronologia Sacra.</hi> There are sundry passages in those Notes relating to the Kings before-mention'd, which I could not but take more especial notice of; but I shall examine only two of them.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. He asserts that <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> was the younger Brother of <hi>Iehoiakim,</hi> though he reign'd before him. See Note 7th.</item>
               <item>2. He suspects, that when they began to Reign, <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> was but thirteen years old, and <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> only fifteen. So in Note 8th.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:99608:3"/>The Learned <hi>Cappellus</hi> was (it seems) so secure of the truth of that assertion, that <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> was the younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he offers nothing at all in way of confirmation of it. But others have attempted to prove it by the arguments following; the validity of which we shall briefly examine.</p>
            <p>Arg. 1. If <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> was not the younger Brother, why did they Anoint him, 2 <hi>Kings,</hi> 23.30. for the eldest Sons of their Kings were not Anointed?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It is not true, that none but the younger Sons were Anointed; <hi>Iehoash</hi> was not a younger Brother when he was Proclaimed King for all his brethren were slain, at least, six years before, 2 <hi>Kings,</hi> 11.1, 2, 3.) and yet he was Anointed, <hi>v.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Suppose that they did not ordinarily Anoint the eldest, yet they did it in the case of <hi>Iehoahaz,</hi> that by this Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity they might confirm him in the Kingdom, in opposition to <hi>Pharaoh-nechoh,</hi> or any that he might obtrude upon them. Or by Anointing him they declar'd, That the Kingdom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing disturb'd, by the Arms of the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> they deliver'd it to <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> (<hi>tanquam de integro</hi>) as it was a new.</p>
            <p>Arg. 2. <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> was the same with <hi>Shallum</hi> mention'd, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3. Now <hi>Shallum</hi> is there said to be the fourth Son of <hi>Iosiah,</hi> and so he was, of necessity, younger Brother to <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoiakim,</hi> who was <hi>Iosiahs</hi> second Son (for 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.15. the Sons of <hi>Iosiah</hi> are reckon'd thus, The first born <hi>Iohanan,</hi> the second <hi>Iehoiakim,</hi> the third <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> the fourth <hi>Shallum</hi>;) that <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> was <hi>Shallum,</hi> there mention'd, they think to be manifest from <hi>Ier.</hi> 22.11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> That, which they say, is not manifest from <hi>Ier.</hi> 22.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is not manifest that the <hi>Shallum,</hi> Jer. 22. was <hi>Iehoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. If it was, yet it is not manifest that the <hi>Shallum,</hi> Jer. 22. was the same with the <hi>Shallum</hi> mention'd, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3. Some think that by <hi>Shallum,</hi> Jer. 22. was meant <hi>Iehoiakim. Flamin. Nobilius</hi> tells us, that the 72, according to one Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> instead of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. It is probable that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> being found in the Margin (some having set it there as an interpretation of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) crept from thence into the Text. Others have interpreted the <hi>Shallum,</hi> Jer. 22. to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99608:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> for the Kingdom of <hi>Iudah</hi> had an end, or was overthrown, when he was King. And so (say they) he was rightly nam'd <hi>Shallum,</hi> which signifies a consummation or finishing. Of this opinion was <hi>R. Solomon</hi>; yea, it seems, by <hi>R. Kimchi,</hi> that this was the generally receiv'd opinion among the <hi>Iewish</hi> Doctors; see them both in <hi>Ier.</hi> 22. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Kimchi</hi> himself was of opinion that <hi>Shallum,</hi> Jer. 22. was <hi>Iehoiakim.</hi> And I have not met with any <hi>Iewish</hi> Writer, that interprets <hi>Shallum</hi> to be <hi>Iehoahaz,</hi> but <hi>Ab. Ezra.</hi> So that from all this, we may conclude that it is not so manifest that <hi>Shallum,</hi> Jer. 22. was <hi>Iehoahaz,</hi> as some bear us in hand.</p>
            <p>But 2dly. Suppose it was manifest that <hi>Shallum,</hi> in <hi>Ier.</hi> 22. was <hi>Iehoahaz,</hi> yet it is not manifest that that <hi>Shallum</hi> in <hi>Ier.</hi> 22. was the same with the <hi>Shallum</hi> mention'd <hi>Chron.</hi> 3. and so it appears not that <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> was that <hi>Shallum</hi>; especially, if the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Writers, <hi>ap. S. Hieron,</hi> say truly that <hi>Shallum</hi> was a common name to all the Sons of <hi>Iosiah.</hi> Yea, it seems impossible that <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> should be that <hi>Shallum.</hi> That <hi>Shallum</hi> was the fourth and youngest Son of <hi>Iosiah,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> (if he was that <hi>Shallum</hi>) was the younger Brother of <hi>Zedekiah, Iosiahs</hi> third, as well as of <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> the second Son. Now it seems impossible that <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> should be the younger Brother of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> and must seem so to every one that compares their ages when they began to reign. <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> was twenty three years old when he began his reign, 2 <hi>Kings.</hi> 23.31. when <hi>Zedekiah</hi> was only twenty one years of age, when he entred upon his, 2 <hi>Kings,</hi> 24.18. and that was above eleven years after the beginning of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoahaz</hi>'s reign; for <hi>Iehoiakims</hi> eleven years reign was between theirs. See 2 <hi>Kings,</hi> 23.36. Now is it possible, that he who was twenty three years old, should be the younger Brother of one that was but twenty one years old above eleven years after? Could <hi>Hamutal</hi> bring forth the elder Brother thirteen years after that she was deliver'd of the younger? <hi>Scaliger</hi> acknowledges this to be a difficulty which he could not assoil, but wishes others to do it for him (<hi>Quaerent studiosi,</hi> so he.) Let us see then how others have endeavour'd to solve it.</p>
            <list>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:99608:4"/>
               <item>1. Some say that the <hi>Shallum,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3. was indeed <hi>Iosiahs</hi> third Son, and elder than <hi>Zedekiah.</hi> It is true, he is call'd the fourth, but (say they) that is not in respect of age, but because of the shortness of his reign, his unworthy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour in it. But this needs no confutation, <hi>Scaliger</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self calls it <hi>futilis solutio.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. Others say that <hi>Zedekiah</hi> was made King while his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther liv'd, and reigned together with him three years. And that when 'tis said that he was twenty one years old when he began to reign, the meaning is, When he began to reign with his Father three years before his death; at which time <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoahaz</hi> was only twenty years of age, and consequently younger than <hi>Zedekiah</hi> by one year.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">But 1. The sense of the Text, 2 <hi>Kings.</hi> 24.1. is plainly that <hi>Zedekiah</hi> was but the age of twenty one years when he was made King by <hi>Nabuchadnezzar, Iehoiakim</hi> being carry'd Captive to <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. How appears it that <hi>Zedekiah</hi> ever reign'd with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? It is a thing so improbable in it self, that <hi>Iosiah</hi> should pass by the other, and take his third Son to reign with him, that it requires very good proof. And yet all the proof that is offer'd is from <hi>Ier.</hi> 27.1, 2, 3. where we read, that in the beginning of the reign of <hi>Iehoiakim,</hi> the Prophet was commanded to prepare Bonds and Yokes, and to send them to certain Kings, by the hands of the Ambassadors that came to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to <hi>Zedekiah</hi> King of <hi>Iudah.</hi> The neighbouring Kings who had understood that <hi>Zedekiah</hi> was made King three years before his Fathers Death, did think that he reign'd still after his Fathers decease, and so sent their Ambassadors to him. Thus <hi>Ab. Ezra</hi> in <hi>Dan.</hi> 1. But this Interpretation is manifestly very far fetch'd, and therefore much time needs not be spent in the examination of it.. All the stress lyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, That Ambassadors were sent unto <hi>Zedekiah</hi> as King of <hi>Iudah,</hi> in the beginning of the reign of <hi>Iehoiakim,</hi> wh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch cannot be proved from that Text. Some have thought that when 'tis said, In the beginning of the reign of <hi>Iehoiakim,</hi> V. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Iehoiakim,</hi> by the Scribes negligence, hath crept into the Text instead of <hi>Zedekiah.</hi> Or however that, by <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoiakim</hi> we are to understand <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> for they say that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99608:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> was a common name to all the Sons of <hi>Iosiah.</hi> S. <hi>Hieron</hi> was of opinion, That that <hi>v.</hi> 1. belongs to the foregoing Chapter, <hi>viz.</hi> The twenty sixth, and in no wise to that which follows in chap. 27. As he also observes, that it was not found in the Copies of the 72, which they had then, as it is wanting in some Editions of that Translation now. But I shall wave all this, and suppose that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the former part of chap. 27, were deliver'd to the Prophet in the beginning of <hi>Ieboiakim</hi>'s reign, yet it will not follow that Ambassadors were sent to <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> as King of <hi>Iudah,</hi> at that time. For 1. That might be given in charge to the Prophet, in the time of <hi>Iehoiakim,</hi> which he was not to execute till the reign of <hi>Zedekiah.</hi> He might receive a command in the time of the one, what he should do and say in the reign of the other; see <hi>v.</hi> 12. of that chap. 27. 2. Some have thought that the Prophet did then presently execute some part of that which was given him in charge, <hi>i. e.</hi> He did put the Bonds and Yokes upon his Neck, and did carry them (tho' not constantly, yet at certain times) during the reigns of <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> and <hi>Iehoiakin,</hi> and to the fourth year of <hi>Zedekiah</hi>; even fifteen years (says <hi>R. Solom.</hi> in <hi>Loc.</hi>) till <hi>Hananiah</hi> broke them from his Neck, <hi>Ier.</hi> 28.10. I cannot dismiss this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation without remarking that <hi>Kimchi</hi> takes notice of it, and expresly alledges <hi>Ab. Ezra</hi> for it; and yet doth not assent to it, but gives a quite other exposition of <hi>Ier.</hi> 27.1, 2, 3. as well as <hi>R. Solom.</hi> doth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Some think to Solve the aforesaid difficulty, by saying that the <hi>Zedekiah</hi> who succeeded <hi>Iehoiakin,</hi> and was then only of the age of twenty one years, was the <hi>Zedekiah</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.16. (where we read the Sons of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoiakim, Ieconiah</hi> his Son, <hi>Zedekiah</hi> his Son) and not <hi>Zedekiah</hi> the Son of <hi>Iosiah,</hi> spoken of <hi>v.</hi> 15. That he were <hi>Zedekiah</hi> mention'd <hi>v.</hi> 16. they prove from 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.10. where he is call'd the Brother of <hi>Iehoiakin.</hi> But to this the answer is easie, it being known and acknowledg'd that the word Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in Holy Writ, is taken very frequently in a larger sense, <hi>viz.</hi> for any Kinsman. Thus the <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> who succeeded <hi>Iehoiakin,</hi> was his Brother, <hi>i. e.</hi> his near Kinsman, for he was indeed his Unkle or Fathers Brother. We have suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99608:5"/>
warrant for this Interpretation from 2 <hi>Kings,</hi> 24.17. where this <hi>Zedekiah</hi> is expresly call'd his Fathers Brother; yea, the seventy two and Syr. (not to mention the Vulg.) read not his Brother, but his Unkle or Fathers Brother, even in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.10. Besides, if this <hi>Zedekiah</hi> was the <hi>Zedekiah</hi> mention'd 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.16. and the Brother of <hi>Iehoiakin</hi> (as these men pretend) they will acknowledge that he was his younger Brother, and then (unless they will admit a vacancy or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regnum of three or four years, betwixt <hi>Iehoiakin</hi> and <hi>Zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi>) he could not be twenty one years old when he began his reign; for <hi>Iehoiakin</hi> was but eighteen years old when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to reign, 2 <hi>Kings,</hi> 24.8. and reign'd only three months and ten days. Add hereto, that the <hi>Zedekiah</hi> which succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Iehoiakin</hi> was the Son of <hi>Hamutal,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings,</hi> 24.17. that <hi>Hamutal</hi> undoubtedly, which was the Mother of <hi>Iehoahaz,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings,</hi> 23.31. Finally, can words express more clearly what <hi>Zedekiah</hi> it was that reign'd after <hi>Iehoiakin</hi> or <hi>Coniah,</hi> than those do <hi>Ier.</hi> 37.1? And King <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> the Son of <hi>Iosiah,</hi> reign'd instead of <hi>Coniah</hi> the Son of <hi>Iehoiakim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Arg. 3. <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> was only twenty three years old when he began his reign, 2 <hi>Kings,</hi> 23.31. and but three months after, we find <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> to have been twenty five years old, 2 <hi>Kings,</hi> 23.31, 36. therefore <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> was elder than <hi>Iehoahaz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It doth not appear that <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> was so old three months after that <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> began his reign. <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> was twenty five years old when he began to reign, <hi>i. e.</hi> (say some) when he began to reign in his own right, which he could not do until his Brother <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> was dead. But suppose we grant that those words, When we began to reign, do refer to the time when he was first made King by <hi>Pharaoh nechoh,</hi> there might be an interval of time between <hi>Nechohs</hi> removing <hi>Iehoahaz,</hi> and substituting <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> in his place. When he had remov'd <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> from the Kingdom, he either took him along with him from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to <hi>Riblah,</hi> or sent for him thither. <hi>Riblah,</hi> according to St. <hi>Hieron.</hi> in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47. was <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> and accordingly the <hi>Targ. Ionath.</hi> and <hi>Ierus.</hi> in <hi>Num.</hi> 34.11. interpret <hi>Riblah</hi> to be <hi>Dophne</hi>; as also others tell us, that <hi>Antioch</hi> was built out of the ruins of an ancient
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99608:5"/>
City call'd <hi>Riblah.</hi> Now <hi>Antioch</hi> was at a considerable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and a proportionable time must be allow'd for <hi>Iehoahaz</hi>'s journey from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> thither, and the same time (if not more) for <hi>Nechoch</hi>'s march from thence to <hi>Iudea,</hi> to order the affairs of the Country; also some time for the settling those affairs (and how long he might stay at <hi>Riblah</hi> after <hi>Iehoahaz</hi>'s coming thither we know not.) All this may make it reasonable to believe, that a considerable space of time did intervene between <hi>Iehoahaz</hi>'s removal from, and <hi>Iehoiakims</hi> entrance upon the Kingdom, which is mentioned only after <hi>Iehoahaz</hi>'s being bound in <hi>Riblah,</hi> and the settling the Tribute in <hi>Iudea:</hi> See 2 <hi>Kings,</hi> 23.33, 34. The Thesis of which, <hi>Scaliger</hi> gives his judgment in the small Tract before-mention'd, is this, That between the end of <hi>Iehoahaz</hi>'s reign, and the beginning of <hi>Iehoiakims,</hi> there inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven'd the space of two years more or less. This position he endeavours to overthrow by sundry arguments, but the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering them will not require much time or pains. In the first, he only begs the thing in question, <hi>viz.</hi> That after that <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> had continu'd three months in the Kingdom, <hi>Nechoh</hi> presently appointed <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> to succeed. The third and fourth Arguments depends upon this, That there must be a Septenary number of years between <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> fourteenth year, and the destruction of the Temple; as also between <hi>Moses</hi>'s death and the destruction of it. To us therefore, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge no necessity of a Septenary number of years, these arguments signifie as little as the first. His second Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument only remains, which is this: The fourth year of <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> was the twenty third from the thirteenth of <hi>Iosiah,</hi> Jer. 25.1, 3. from which, to the beginning of the reign of <hi>Iehoahaz,</hi> were nineteen compleat years; from thence, to the beginning of the fourth year of <hi>Iehoiakim,</hi> compleat three years; and so from the thirteenth of <hi>Iosiah,</hi> to the beginning of <hi>Iehoiakims</hi> fourth year, were twenty two compleat; therefore the twenty third year, <hi>Ier.</hi> 25. was only current. But if an interregnum of two years had interven'd, it had not been the twenty third year but the twenty fifth: thus he. For answer, <hi>Scaliger</hi> tells us not what ground he had to reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on compleat nineteen years, from the thirteenth of <hi>Iosiah</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:99608:6"/>
to the beginning of the reign of <hi>Iehoahaz. Iosiah</hi> reign'd 31 years; substract 13 out of 31, and there remains 18. Reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then 18 years to the beginning of <hi>Iehoahaz</hi>'s reign; two from the beginning of his to the beginning of <hi>Iehoiakims,</hi> and then (as <hi>Scaliger</hi> himself computes) three years to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Iehoiakims</hi> fourth year, and you have exactly the number of twenty three years, according to <hi>Ier.</hi> 25. I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly add, that though <hi>Scaliger</hi> would by no means allow of any Interregnum between <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> and <hi>Iehoiakim,</hi> yet the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Cappellus</hi> was not so averse from admitting one: For he allots a whole year to <hi>Iehoahaz,</hi> although the Scripture says that he reign'd only three months, <hi>viz.</hi> He conceiv'd that there was a vacancy or interregnum of nine months.</p>
            <p>Having thus examined the Arguments that are brought to support <hi>Cappellus</hi>'s assertion, I shall now propose one or two on the other side, to prove that <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> was the elder Brother.</p>
            <p>Arg. 1. If <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> was the same with <hi>Iohanan</hi>; then he was certainly the elder Brother, for of <hi>Iohanan</hi> it is said ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.15. that he was the first born. Some say that he is call'd the first born, not in respect of birth but of dignity, because he was thought most worthy to succeed his Father in the Kingdom. But this needs no confutation; or, if it did, <hi>Tostatus</hi> in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3. hath refuted it sufficiently. As to <hi>Iehoahaz</hi>'s being the same with <hi>Iohanan,</hi> a late writer says that all Commentators are agreed in it. But I must not say that, partly because I have not consulted all Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors as (it seems) that Author hath, partly because I have met with sundry Commentators that are of a different opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Yet I could easily produce several very judicious Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitors, both Christian and Jewish, that have thought <hi>Iehoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haz</hi> to be <hi>Iohanan.</hi> But I shall rather chuse to prove it by this plain argument, <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> being the son of <hi>Iosiah,</hi> must of necessity be either <hi>Iohanan</hi> or <hi>Shallum</hi> (this <hi>Scaliger</hi> urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth); but it hath been prov'd above, that he could not be <hi>Shallum,</hi> and so he must be <hi>Iohanan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Arg. 2. He that succeeds his Father in the Kingdom, should by the Law of Nations be the eldest son (this <hi>Scaliger</hi> grants) but <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> succeeded his Father in the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:99608:6"/>Having thus considered the arguments on both sides, as diligently and impartially as I can, I judge it most agreeable to the Scripture-history, to say that <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> was the eldest son of <hi>Iosiah,</hi> as being the same with <hi>Iohanan.</hi> All the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty that this puts us upon, is, The admitting an Interreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num of a year and nine months between the end of <hi>Iehoahaz</hi>'s three months, and the beginning of the reign of <hi>Iehoiakim</hi>; or of not so much, if <hi>Iehoahaz</hi>'s twenty three years, 2 <hi>Kings,</hi> 23.31. were compleat, and <hi>Iehoiakims</hi> twenty fifth year, <hi>v.</hi> 36. was only current. This seems to me not comparable to the insupportable difficulties that attend the other opinion.</p>
            <p>The second passage in the Learned <hi>Cappellus,</hi> which we shall examine (but more briefly) is this: When <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> is said to to be twenty three years old, and <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> twenty five, he suspects that thirteen should be read instead of twenty three, and fifteen instead of twenty five. His reason is, because if <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> had been twenty five years old when he began to reign, he must have been born when his Father was but fifteen years of age, and conceiv'd when he was but fourteen; accordingly, if <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> had been twenty three years of age, his Father must have been only of the age of sixteen when he was born. Now it seemed to him very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with <hi>Iosiahs</hi> piety, to begin to beget Children so soon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. I cannot but judge it very agreeable to that good Kings Piety, to make use of the proper remedy against means to subdue youthful Lusts. Some have believ'd that <hi>Solomon</hi> was neither fifteen nor fourteen years of age when he begat <hi>Rehoboam</hi>; whether they had firm grounds for their belief I shall not dispute; see <hi>St. Hieron. epist. ad Vitale.</hi> 2. <hi>Cappellus</hi> in saying that <hi>Iosiah</hi> was but fourteen years old when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat <hi>Iehoiakim,</hi> proceeds upon his former mistake, that <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoiakim</hi> was elder than <hi>Iehoahaz</hi>; but according to our Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis, <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> was not conceived till <hi>Iosiahs</hi> fifteenth year, or the beginning of his sixteenth:</p>
