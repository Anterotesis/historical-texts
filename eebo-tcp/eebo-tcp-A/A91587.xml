            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE QVEENES MAJESTIES Gracious Meſſage, to her Soveraigne Lord the King of Great Brittaine.</head>
            <p>BY a Letter from the Kings Majeſties Court at <hi>Hampton,</hi> it is intimated, that there hath lately arrived a meſſenger from the Kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> with a meſſage from the queen of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to the King, a Copy whereof followeth:</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>AS there could no occaſion miniſter greater griefe to my ſorrowfull heart, then to hear of a ſhort adjornment of theſe unnaturall diviſions betweene you and your liege people, and preſently to have the conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming flames of a new war ſudenly to break out afreſh in your languiſhing kingdomes: ſo there could no wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comer newes ſalute mine ear, then ſpeedily to heare of a ſmall period to be put to theſe unhappy diſtractions,
<pb facs="tcp:160529:3"/>that ſo the ſweet harmony of deſired peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord may re-unite you and your ſubjects, and tye you faſt each to other in the ſacred bands of love and unity, and therefore I ſhall deſire your Majeſty to grant your Parliament and people whatſoever with a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and Honour you may, for the further preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſhedding innocent bloud, &amp; preſervation of thoſe committed to your charge. Sir, aſſure your ſelfe, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall be diſpleaſing to me, that diſpleaſeth you my Lord; for I ſhall for ever eſteeme your good, and the good of all your faithfull Subjects, the only buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of all my actions, and ſhall be contented to ſhare with you and them (not only in bleſſings, but) even in the worſt of times that can happen to a diſconſolate &amp; unjuſt baniſhed wife. Sir, concerning the Propoſitions tendred your Majeſty, I humbly conceive, the chiefe things to be conſidered will be two, Conſcience and Policy. For the firſt, I know it never entred into your Royal thoughts to change the Government by Biſhops not only concurring with the moſt generall opinion of moſt Chriſtians in all ages, as being the beſt; but conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering you hold your ſelfe bound by the Oath you took at your Coronation, not to alter the Government of the Church from what you found it. And for the Churches Patrimony, you cannot ſuffer any diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or alienation of it, without danger to your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or breach of your Coronation Oath; but whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall be offered for the certifying abuſes crept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church in Government or Diſcipline, or, for the eaſe of tender conſciences, (indangering not the foundation,) <hi>I</hi> deſire your Majeſty to lend a ſpeedy ear unto, and give your gracious anſwer. For as it is your Majeſties duty to protect the Church, ſo it is the
<pb facs="tcp:160529:3"/>Churches duty to aſſiſt your Majeſty in maintaining your juſt authority; for as your Predeceſſors have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes bin careful to keep the dependency of the clergy intirely upon the Crown, without which (as <hi>I</hi> humbly conceive) it will ſcarcely ſit faſt upon your Royall head; therefore it behoves your Majeſty to do nothing to change or leſſen this ſo neceſſary dependency. The other maine Propoſition will be concerning the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia: Next to conſcience (certainly) there is no fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>r ſubject for a Kings quarrell; for without it, your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties power is but a ſhaddow, and therefore by no meanes to be quitted, but to be maintained according to the known Lawes of the Land: yet for the ſpeedy attainment of this ſo long looked for and wiſhed for peace, prayed for by all good Chriſtians, That your Majeſty may be pleaſed to permit the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and all other ſtrong Holds and Garriſons, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Military Forts, to reſide in the hands of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments Generall Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> untill articles be performed and agreed upon, to give ſuch further aſſurance for performance of conditions, as your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſhall judge neceſſary for the concluding of a firme and laſting peace; which being once ſetled, all things may return, and run in their ancient channels.</p>
                  <p>Thus, <hi>Dear Heart,</hi> underſtanding that Commiſſioners were ſent to you, from both Houſes of Parliament, with Propoſitions, <hi>I</hi> thought good to put you in mind that you have a care of your honour; and that if you have a peace, it may be ſuch as may hold. Farewell, <hi>My deare Heart, I</hi> cannot write any more, but that <hi>I</hi> am abſolutely</p>

            <head>The Generals Declaration.</head>
            <p>VVHereas the great neglect of divers perſons within the City of <hi>London,</hi> hath occaſioned too many delayes in raiſing Money for ſupply of the Army, and other Forces of the Kingdome; His Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> and the General-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of the Army, Doth declare, That they take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the great wants of the Souldiery, both of the Army, and other Forces, and Garriſons; as alſo of the ſufferings of the County, in reſpect of free quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which might have been peevented, and a courſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for disbanding ſuperfluous Forces, and ſending o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of others for the reliefe of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of thoſe that are there already, had it not been for neglect or delay of thoſe on whom the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have depended in that particular, and they doe eſpecially take notice of the delayes made by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in advancing of that ſumme, which the Houſes have demanded of them upon the ſecurity of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reares ſo long ſince due from the City to the Army; upon which they doe declare, and propound to this effect.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they cannot but conſider the notorious rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe of the Court of Aldermen, to the advancing of far greater ſums for the raiſing of a new warre, and proſecution of the late miſchievous practiſes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes againſt the Parliament and Army; and that as their predipitate forwardneſſe therein, was the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Armies coming into theſe parts, ſo their backwardneſſe to the raiſing or advancing of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney now required for the ſervice of the Parliament, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:160529:5"/>ſupply of the Army, hath been and is the occaſion of the armies continuance hence: and therefore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but offer it is, as what they humbly conceive moſt juſt and reaſonable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That for what time their defauls or delayes have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned, and ſhall further occaſion the Armies ſtay here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, the charge thereof ſhould ſome way be laid upon them, and their adherents about the City.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Houſes would be pleaſed ſpeedily to conſider of the Delinquencie of thoſe that had a hand in the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, Deſine, and Engagement of a new Warre, and that ſuch Fines may be upon them for the ſame, as ſhall bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, ſince it is moſt evident, that for the ſpeedy bringing in of the money required upon the arrears, there wants not in the ſaid Major, Aldermen, and Common-Councell, either authority to levy it, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to advance it by way of Loan till it can be levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and it ir therefore offered,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That in caſe the Money be not brought in by the time limited, the Parliament would be pleaſed to give leave to the Generall (with the advice and directions of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee for the Army) for the levying of the ſaid Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reares</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which they rather deſire from grounds of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and evidence from the ſpeeches of many in the City, and deſignes and hopes of the Parliament and Armies Enemies to raiſe the Army into diſtempers, and the Country about them into confuſion.</p>
