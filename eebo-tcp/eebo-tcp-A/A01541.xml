            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

such times not vnseasonable. To supply that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, I make bold now to present you with some passages of such a subiect, as it is like, had then beene handled, if opportunitie had serued. They are raw notes of a Sermon long since made on the like occasion: Which finding by mee, and willing to imbrace any opportunitie of expressing my loue there in any degree, where I iustly owe so great a measure, I sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly reuised and prepared them for the pres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e. And albeit, in the reuising of them I obserued some defects, and could well haue beene content to haue taken further time and paines for the better polishing, and the more orderly digesting of them, as also for the speciall applying of them to your selues, to whome now they are addressed: yet I supposed it would bee much more conuenient and behoouefull, without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delay, while the occasion is yet fresh, to present you with them as they are, that they might salute a New-married Couple at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring in of the New-yeere. An exact trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, or large discourse of <hi>Marriage Duties</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3122:3"/>
(though the Title be such) I hope they will not expect, that shall vnderstand that they haue here but the Substance of one Sermon, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, when it was, within the compasse of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more then an houre, and vpon the recolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of my Meditations afterward, at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of some, not much enlarged. And though I doubt not but you may meete with many profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Treatises of the like Argument, yet I was desirous you should haue somewhat thereof from my selfe. The truth of God, I wot well, is the same, and deserueth all due regard, by whomsoeuer it is deliuered. But yet there is some efficacie added to it, when it is brought vs by those whome we specially affect, and of whome we are perswaded that they doe likewise in spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner affect vs. Of this mutuall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction betweene you both and my selfe, as there is in diuers respects very great and iust ground, so, I hope, there is no doubt at all made on either side of it. The assurance whereof if it may helpe to supply some defects that may be found in this vntimely birth, some good fruite, I
<pb facs="tcp:3122:4"/>
hope, by the reading of it may redound to you both. Much I heartily desire may daily, both by this and by all other good meanes, to all your friends ioy, your owne mutuall comfort here, and your eternall happinesse hereafter. With which vnfained desire I end for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and rest.</p>

            </p>
            <p>First, at the duties of married persons <hi>of man and wife</hi> the Apostle beginneth here, as <note n="(a)" place="margin">Eph. 5.22, 25</note> else-where; and so proceedeth to the duties <note n="(b)" place="margin">Vers. 20.21, Eph. 6.1, 4.</note> of <hi>Children and Parents</hi> in the second place, and <note n="*" place="margin">Vers. 22. &amp; Chap. 4.1. Eph. 6.5, 9.</note> of <hi>Seruants and Masters</hi> in the third place.</p>
            <p>First, <note n="(c)" place="margin">Gen. 2.22.</note> because this societie it is the first that euer was in the world: and therefore as it was <note n="*" place="margin">

               </note> the first in nature, so it is the first here in order: the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle beginneth first with that which in course of nature is first.</p>
            <p>Secondly, because this is <note n="(d)" place="margin">Psal. 128.3. &amp; 127.3.</note> the fountaine from whence the rest flow: and the streames can not flow pure and cleare vnlesse the fountaine be first clensed and kept cleane. The Apostle therefore
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3122:6"/>
wisely beginneth at the Head-spring, that a good course being setled in this principall societie, it may be the better kept and continued in others that is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue and flow from it.</p>
            <p>And this point thus obserued may first serue to shew what is one maine cause of much neglect of dutie in many families, in children towards parents, in seruants toward Master and Mistres; because the gouernours are not carefull of mutuall duties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt themselues, of concord and agreement the one with the other, of loue and fidelitie the one to the other, of respectfull and regardfull carriage the one towards the other. And so neglect of dutie and difference betweene them is a meanes to breed a contempt of one or both in those that should be guided by them: making seruants and children to take occasion of libertie and faile in their duty to them, as they faile in dutie either to other. Yea it is a iust iudgement oft with God to punish the one by the other: as <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>Secondly, it may admonish married folke, that are heads of houses, if they desire to haue things go wel' in the family that they haue a speciall care of those duties that God hath enioyned them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard either of other. That will be a meanes to make duties passe more orderly both from them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and from others to them, as the contrarie prooueth ordinarily a great hindrance to either.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3122:6"/>
For as in a clocke or a watch, if the spring be faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the wheeles can not goe, or if they mooue not either other, the hammer can not strike: so here, where dutie faileth betweene man and w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore married persons, if they desire to haue duties performed to them by others, they must first performe what is fit and conuenient either to other: remembring that the due performance of mutuall duties to either, shall both make them fitter for the performance of good offices to others, and others readier in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of theirs vnto them.</p>

            <p>First to shew the inferioritie of the wife in regard of the husband; for we may obserue that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle beginneth euer with the dutie of the inferiour: <note n="(k)" place="margin">Vers 20. Eph 6.1.</note> first <hi>the childrens,</hi>

            </p>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3122:7"/>
inferiour and so goeth vp to the superiour. The wiues dutie is as the base or ground that the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band dutie is built vpon. It is that that must draw dutie and respect from the husband. <note n="(a)" place="margin">1. Pet 3.7.</note> 
               <hi>Likewise,</hi> saith the Apostle <hi>Peter, Let the men liue with their wiues, &amp;c.</hi> Hauing spoken of the wiues behauiour toward her husband before. Not that it is lawfull for the superiour to omit his dutie, if the inferiour be slacke or faultie in the performance of hers, but to shew in course of nature whither should begin to shew dutie.</p>
            <p>And this first serueth to admonish the wife to be forward in performance of such good duties as God requireth on her part; and not to straine courtesie and stand vpon tearmes, as to say, <hi>Let him doe what he should doe, and then I will doe what is befitting me.</hi> Wouldest thou haue him to doe that that is his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? there is no way more agreeable to the word and will of God, more consonant to the course and order of nature, more likely to prooue successefull and effectuall to that purpose and to haue a blessing of God goe with it, then the carefull performance of thy dutie to him, then which nothing is more forcible to draw dutie from him. In a word the wiues maine dutie here is subiection, the mans principally Loue; <note n="*" place="margin">

offence shall arise betweene man and wife, whither is to seeke to other: Howsoeuer the husband in discretion; (being that he is or ought to be the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, and the woman held to be the weaker; as <note n="(b)" place="margin">Gen. 13.8.</note>

            <p>And here commeth to bee condemned the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of those women that will do all of their owne head, that will haue things as they list themselues, and after their owne minde: that refuse and thinke scorne either to aske of their husbands aduice what to doe, or to follow it in such things as they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised vnto. And so disobedience breedeth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the husband in them, and contempt in them causeth wrath in him, which openeth a gap to many grieuous euils. Such must know that in disobeying them they disobey God in them and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3122:12"/>
prouoke him against themselues: besides that they procure nothing vnto themselues but an euill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port abroad, and an vnquiet life at home.</p>
            <p>And therefore a wise and discreete woman ought to choose rather; when the thing enioyned or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised shall import some difficultie, or carry with it some inconueniencie; howsoeuer she may in good tearmes propound it by way of excuse, yet if the husband shall persist in his minde that he will haue it so; she ought, I say, to choose rather, and account it better (so long as it import no euill) to buy her owne peace and the peace of a good conscience, to purchase peace with God and man by meeke and quiet obseruance, then to breake or hazard the breach of either by her peeuish resistance.</p>
            <p>But of all others the course of those is most vaine that will take to themselues the whole commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things done by mutuall consent and aduice: and so seeke to honour themselues by discrediting their husbands whom God hath commanded them to honour, and whose honour they should account as their owne.

            <p>And here by the way let the <hi>Husband</hi> learne his dutie in part, ere we come directly vnto it. For if
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3122:13"/>
the wife be to submit and to subiect her selfe vnto him; it to be admonished by him and to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of him: then is he to gouerne and admonish, to giue counsell and aduice.</p>
            <p>And therefore considering that he is called to be <hi>a guide</hi> to his wife) he must labour for holy wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and spirituall discretion, that hee may be fit and able to guide and gouerne in good manner and to good purpose. And hee had neede be wise and discreete himselfe, that is to be guide to another. Otherwise as the Apostle, <note n="e" place="margin">1 Tim. 3.5. Prov. 2.17.</note> How is he fit to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne Gods house that can not gouerne well his owne house, so how shal he be fit to guide another, that is not able to guide himselfe?</p>
            <p>In regard whereof <hi>parents</hi> also, as they must not be ouerhasty to ioyne their children in that estate, ere they be come to some staiednesse: So they must be carefull, (especially where they perceiue some want that way,) to further them with all conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent helps in that kinde: that so by their diligent care and furtherance that may be supplyed that is defectiue on their parts.</p>
            <p>Now this then condemneth the preposterous practise of some men, that in a kinde either of foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish statelinesse or fond remissenesse will seeme to referre all to the wife <note n="a" place="margin">1 Pet. 3.7.</note>

            <p>As also of those that bring them vp so in idlenes and dissolutenesse, that they are good for nothing when they are married, but to sit in the shop as a babe on a stall, to see and be seene, or as an image in the house, that hath lims without vse; being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

            <p>Hitherto we haue spoken of the <hi>Maine dutie</hi> on
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3122:17"/>
the <hi>wiues</hi> part, namely, <hi>Submission</hi> or <hi>Subiection,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with the particulars or at least the pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ncipall of those that thence issue.</p>
            <p>We come now to the <hi>manner</hi> of the performance of all the former, and that is, saith our Apostle, <hi>In the Lord:</hi> a phrase vsed by the Apostle <note n="a" place="margin">Eph. 6.1. 1 Cor. 7.39.</note> in the like case else-where: and it may be taken two waies, as <hi>a note of Direction,</hi> or as <hi>a note of Limitation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. As a note of <hi>direction,</hi> prescribing the ground and manner of this submission; that it bee done in obedience of God and the commandement of God, in conscience of the order and ordinance of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As a note of <hi>limitation,</hi> describing the bounds and limits of this submission, assistance, reuerence, and obedience; that it extend not it selfe to any<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing against the will and word of God.</p>
            <p>In the former sense it seemeth to be vsed by the Apostle, where <note n="b" place="margin">Eph. 6 1.</note> he speaketh of <hi>childrens dutie</hi>; in the latter, <note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 7.39.</note> where he applieth it to <hi>widdowes marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</hi> And the latter followeth vpon the former. For a man can not doe ought against Gods will or word out of obedience to his will and word: it implieth a manifest contradiction. And therefore whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is done in obedience to Gods will must needs so farre forth be done according to, and not against his word or will. The former I take here to be the direct meaning of the words; the latter by way of consequence is deduced from it. And so this branch affordeth two points concerning the dutie here enioyned.</p>
            <p>First, that this <hi>Submission</hi> for the ground of it

            <p>For first, it is <note n="f" place="margin">1 Tim. 4.8.</note> 
               <hi>Godlinesse</hi> alone that <hi>hath the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises both of this life and the life to come</hi>: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there is no reward for ought that proceedeth not from it.</p>

            <p>Which point serueth, First to shew a difference betweene a godly and a worldly wise, a Christian woman &amp; an heathen, a faithfull and an infidel. For an heathen woman may doe all outward duties that a Christian wife doth, out of a naturall or carnall loue to her husband, or out of a desire of her owne ease and quiet that dependeth thereupon, or out of other naturall and ciuill respects, as feare of anger at home, and of euill report abroad: But the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian wife doth all on a further ground; (though these and the like considerations also may make her the more carefull:) out of obedience to God and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:3122:18"/>
the will and word of God; out of a desire to please God, &amp; to approue her self &amp; her courses vnto God. As the heathen subiect serueth God for his Prince, the Christian subiect serueth his prince for God: so the heathen wife obeieth God but for man, whereas the Christian wise obeyeth her husband for God.</p>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in these duties that they may therby gaine as well fauor with God, as loue with their husbands at home, and a good report abroad: if they shall do all in obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God, if they shall do all <note n="a" place="margin">Eph, 5.22.</note> 
               <hi>as vnto God</hi>: as a Christian seruant <note n="b" place="margin">Eph. 67.5. 1 Cor. 7.23. Col 3.23.</note>

            <p>Fourthly, let the husband take heede of being faultie in this dutie of loue in this inward and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire affection toward his wife, which the Apostle of Christ and by him the Spirit of God in so speciall manner requireth and exacteth of him. Some du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties there are though generally required of all, yet in more speciall sort of some: and so this dutie of loue of all in generall, but of married persons more spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially: who are therefore more faultie, if therein they faile.
