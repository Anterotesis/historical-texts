            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Tho. Dangerfield's
ANSVVER
TO
<hi>Elizabeth Cellier</hi>'s Scandalous Pamphlet.</head>
            <p>THis Age, by the unwearied Diligence of the Romantick Handicraft-Women,
hath Produc'd divers Monſters of both Sexes, or rather
I may more properly call them <hi>Devils</hi> in that Miſchievous Dreſs
of Humane Shape, who to blear the Eyes of an Unthinking
Croud, ſtill matter not to offer the greateſt Provocations to the <hi>All-ſeeing
God,</hi> (who either has, or in his good time will diſcover to the World the
bottom of their Miſchiefs, not to be fathom'd by Humane Nature) by dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
their <hi>Diabolical</hi> Contrivances in the charming Shape of <hi>Religion,</hi> hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
if their Deſigns fail, that the pretences of <hi>Piety</hi> may render them fit Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of Pitie; and if ſucceſsful, confirm their Devices. Thus is the true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of <hi>God</hi> abuſed by thoſe Miſcreants, and <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> uſed as a Mask only.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth Cellier</hi> is a Woman that has forfeited her Fidelity
to her <hi>Nuptial Bed,</hi> and when a Woman has once loſt her Modeſty,
ſhe is fit for all ſorts of Miſchief, and there ought to be no farther Credit gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to her; and therefore I hope the Eyes of the People are not to be opened
now by ſuch an Operatrix as ſhe, or their Apprehenſions to be Infatuated
by a ſort of People who wholly devote themſelves to the Service of Hell,
and think to gain <hi>Heaven</hi> by the deſerts of miſchief and Villany. A Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Life, full of Humility and Repentance, might make ſome Impreſſion in
the Hearts of good People, but this Woman and her Aſſociates are a ſort of
<hi>Catterpillers,</hi> whoſe whole Studie it is to Canker and Deſtroy the very Root
of the <hi>Nations</hi> happineſs. And while they ſeem to give a dutiful adoration
to <hi>Sovereignty,</hi> make it their buſineſs to Depoſe and Rob their Native <hi>King</hi>
of his Life, and deprive his beſt <hi>Subjects</hi> of their Hereditary ſhares of <hi>Right</hi>
and <hi>Property,</hi> clandeſtinely deſigning no leſs then a Total Deſtruction of
three Flouriſhing <hi>Kingdomes.</hi> Yet after all this, when once diſcover'd, to the
height of Impudence ſtill with a daring and reflecting Contempt both of
the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Miniſters,</hi> they publiſh Vindications, and impute their Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
to Malitious Proſecutions, and pretend to acquit themſelves
from <hi>Treaſons</hi> of the higheſt nature, by a continu'd ſeries of Confident Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
ſtill acting the ſame or worſe Crimes if poſſible.</p>
            <p>So far do theſe true Off-Springs of the <hi>Devil,</hi> the Father of Lies, out-vie
and over-reach thoſe their dull Contrivances acted in the days of <hi>Yore,</hi> that
they are paſt <hi>Parallel,</hi> ſo that I may ſafely ſay that ſome of their Collatteral
Practices, (ſo lately experienced in theſe <hi>Kingdoms)</hi> may Challenge <hi>Hell</hi> for
Wickedneſs, and the <hi>Devils</hi> themſelves for Subtilty.</p>
            <p>Yet theſe are the Poor <hi>Diſtreſſed Catholicks,</hi> and as they boldly call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<hi>Royaliſts,</hi> who to accompliſh their Deſigns, can Inſinuate, Court, Cringe,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97511:3"/>
Lie, Wade through whole Oceans of Perjuries,—Subornations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay they
can aſſume any ſhape, and are bound to do ſo for the good of the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> nay
and ſuch little things, as audaciouſly branding the <hi>Peers</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> of a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
with falſe and ſcurrilous Reproaches: A fine way to repair the loſſes of a
diſtreſſed Midwife: yet theſe are the People who pretend to ſtand up for the
<hi>King and Country,</hi> and Hypocritically aſſume the Reputation of being concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for the ſafety thereof, when they of all Enemies are the moſt dangerous,
and could they but lull us into a new ſecurity, by ſuch Stories and Fables of
their Innocency, as theſe are, which they dayly publiſh, I fear me, we
ſhould ſoon feel the fatal effects of their <hi>Sorcery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To make which more apparent, I muſt now fall to unravel a certain Bottom
of <hi>Lies,</hi> ſpun to the beſt advantage by the hand of <hi>Impudence,</hi> which is En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled,
<q>Malice Defeated;
OR,
The Deliverance of Elizabeth Cellier.</q>
            </p>
            <p>WHich Book I have Peruſed, and find my ſelf therein diſplayed ſo much
beyond the life, Her ſo much ſhort of her true Colours, and ſuch
material Subject matter fit for my Reply, that I have taken the Pains to draw
from it, ſo far as concerns my ſelf, theſe following Obſervations, and ſhall
confine my ſelf to moſt of her own words, which (as ſhe ſays) were wrote
by her own hand, (which may paſs well enough among the reſt of her Lies)
but, as I am well ſatisfied, was Pend or rather Scribled, by the hand of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Lowſie Dominican Fryar,</hi> now under the <hi>Sentence of Death,</hi> being in
<hi>Newgate,</hi> and Convicted as ſuch, and for being in the <hi>Plots</hi> by the Names
of <hi>Anderſon,</hi> alias <hi>Munſon,</hi> whom I do not queſtion but to ſee hang'd by the
ſame Names one day, with many others of the ſame Tribe.</p>
            <p>The firſt I begin with, is matter of Fact, ſuch as ſhe has been forc'd to
own, and to uſe in her Vindication, which is <hi>(viz.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>pag. 4. <hi>About the 10th. of April</hi> (79) <hi>I went to the Grate at</hi> Newgate <hi>to
ſpeak with him, (viz.</hi> my ſelf) <hi>he was in Irons, and ſaid his Name was</hi> Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>pag. 7. <hi>That I received from him ſome Articles drawn againſt Captain</hi> Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardſon,
<hi>and thereupon gave him Half a Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That I ſent him at ſeveral times after by my Servant Sixteen Shillings, and
Money to pay his Fees that day on which he was Diſcharg'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>pag. 8. <hi>That I paid ſixteen Shillings more to fetch a Coat from Pawn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That I paid</hi> Dangerfield's <hi>Fees in</hi> Newgate, <hi>(which amounted to near</hi> 6. l.)
<hi>and removed him afterwards to the</hi> Kings-Bench, <hi>in order to a diſcovery of one</hi>
Stroud <hi>(which coſt three pounds.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>pag. 10. <hi>That the papers relating to</hi> Stroud's <hi>buſineſs, were found between the</hi>
Pewter <hi>in my Kitchin,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>pag. 12. <hi>That I Collected ſome Money, and did pay five pounds for him, and
the ſame day he came out of Priſon I gave him ten Shillings more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>pag. 13. <hi>That I offered to get him an Enſigns place under the Duke of</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,
<hi>or an Employment to go to Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That I gave him a ſtuff Suit and other neceſſaries, which coſt about three Pounds
ten Shillings,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:97511:3"/>
Thus we have her Bill of Charges according to her own reckoning, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
to Nineteen Pounds fourteen Shillings Six Pence; a very extravagant
piece of Charitie to a Perſon that ſhe never knew or ſaw before in her life, it was
Pity and Compaſſion in a ſingular degree, to cull me out for the Object of her
profuſeneſs, meerly for the ſake of my Tears and Beging, as ſhe pretends; no, no,
Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the <hi>World</hi> is not yet ſo ſtupid to believe you were ſo mightily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amour'd
with my Diſconſolate Ejaculations, out of meer and pure <hi>Charity; Men</hi>
of reaſon will eaſily believe you had other ends, other aims than that of <hi>Charity,</hi>
and that out of your ſmart inſight into <hi>Men,</hi> for which you ſo much commend
your ſelf, you had another kind of proſpect of my <hi>Phiſiognomy</hi> and <hi>Lineaments,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Spell of <hi>Dominican</hi> Mumping, and far beyond the reach of cold, dull,
and inſipid Charity.</p>
            <p>And therefore after I was once in a condition, by means of your ill-boaſted of
<hi>Charity,</hi> to appear upon your intended Tragic Stage, I ſhall give the Reader from
your own words a taſt of ſome of your publick Imployments which you were
pleaſed to confer upon your Servant ſo munificently Rigg'd and Launched into
the <hi>World</hi> by your innocent <hi>Charity:</hi> You ſay, to uſe your own words,</p>
            <p>pag. 13. <hi>That he would often bring me News of the great Deſigns of the Factious,
and that they had drawn Forces into the Citie while his Majeſty was Sick at</hi> Windſor,
<hi>with intent to Subvert the Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>pag. 14. <hi>That many of the Old Rump Officers were new rigg'd, and had Penſions
paid them by the Gentlemen of the Kings-Head Club.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Commiſſions were giving out by the Names of the Keepers of the Liberties of</hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
<hi>and that he was promiſed one among the reſt, I encouraged him to go on, and gave
him Money to defray his Charges,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That he Writ down at ſeveral times, that which was found by Sir</hi> William Waller
<hi>in my Meal Tub.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That I went to the Lord of</hi> Peterborough <hi>and acquainted him with it, and he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
handed us to the Duke,</hi> (of York) <hi>to whom</hi> Willoughby <hi>delivered the paper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That about the latter end of</hi> September, Dangerfield <hi>brought me Stories of the great
preparations of the Faction, That they did publickly own their. Treaſonable Deſigns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> Goodwin <hi>and</hi> Alſop <hi>had made great Collections among the Brethren to carry
on their Rebellious Deſigns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Sir</hi> William Waller <hi>had three Hundred Horſemen ready for Action in an
Hours Warning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the City was ready to riſe, and expected only the Word from the Confederate
Lords,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then ſays ſhe, theſe Diſcourſes being general, made me the eaſier credit him in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
ſo I encouraged him to go on, gave him more Money, and bid him obſerve their
Actions and Deſigns,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Lord, Gentlemen, what had this <hi>Lady</hi> of the <hi>Wicket</hi> to do to be ſo watchful
for the good of the <hi>Common-Wealth,</hi> what did <hi>Politicks</hi> and <hi>State</hi> Affairs concern
her? As if the <hi>Kingdom</hi> had been in labour of a By-blow, or like the Vanquiſh'd
and near-conquer'd <hi>French,</hi> that now the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the ſame diſtreſs, had wanted
another <hi>Joan of Arque,</hi> to deliver them by the dint of her care and <hi>Zeal,</hi> as the
other hair-brain'd <hi>Amazon</hi> had endeavour'd to do by the Dint of her Sword; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
had ſuch deſigns been really on Foot, the <hi>King</hi> had better means of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
than by ſuch a Female Intelligencer as Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth Cellier,</hi> and therefore
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97511:4"/>
notwithſtanding all her <hi>charitable</hi> Cloathing of me, the <hi>Naked Truth</hi> is ſtill the
<hi>Naked Truth;</hi> that all the ſtrange News, and formal Stories which ſhe pretends
I brought her from time to time, were no more than the <hi>Forgeries,</hi> which the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Powis,</hi> her <hi>Midwife</hi> and my ſelf Contrived, ſo that I cannot ſay but that the
Woman did bring forth with my help, but it was nothing but the Embryo of an
ill coddl'd <hi>Plot,</hi> and was the very <hi>Baſtard</hi> that was afterwards found almoſt ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in the <hi>Meal-Tub.</hi> Thoſe Surmiſes and Accuſations which ſhe endeavours to
fix upon honeſt Gentlemen, about <hi>Horſes, Arms, and Money,</hi> (out of her <hi>Zeal</hi> to
his <hi>Majeſties</hi> Service, if any body will be ſo mad to believe her) were thoſe very
individual <hi>Lies,</hi> hatcht as I ſaid before, and of which the <hi>Meal-Tubb</hi> was ſo mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly
brought to bed, and what I was Charm'd to inſiſt upon as often as I
waited on the <hi>King,</hi> as appears by my charge againſt them Both in my firſt <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative;</hi>
Truth far more probable, than any of the foregoing Female Tittle Tattle
of Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth Cellier.</hi>

            <p>Page 14, 15. <hi>That</hi> Willoughby <hi>got drunk, and pick'd a quarrel at the</hi> Rain-bow
Coffee-Houſe, <hi>with one</hi> Keneſtone, <hi>about Sir</hi> Thomas Player, <hi>and thereby made
himſelf obnoxious; ſo that having loſt the hopes of obtaining a Commiſſion himſelf, he
ſought to get one by means of others, and then ſwore God dam him, now the</hi> Papiſts
<hi>would give him no money, he would go to the</hi> Presbyterians, <hi>and they would give
him enough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How far ſhe thinks this may amount to her excuſe, I know not; but as well
living as dying, I muſt declare in the preſence of <hi>God,</hi> (my quarrel being firſt by
accident with that Gentleman, Mr. <hi>Kinaſtone,</hi> who I would now be glad to
know) that the <hi>Counteſs of Powis,</hi> as well as her ſelf, were the perſons that put
me upon the Tumultuous part of it, and did it on purpoſe not only to baffle the
Electing that worthy Member of this preſent <hi>Parliament, Sir</hi> Thomas Player, but
alſo to create a mutiny, or uproar in the <hi>City:</hi> for look ye, Gentlemen, to what
purpoſe elſe ſhould I leave a Challenge for Mr. <hi>Kinaſtone</hi> at the Coffee-Houſe, have
30 men, or upwards, ready Arm'd with <hi>Trunchions, Piſtols, Poinyards,</hi> &amp;c. had
it been my quarrel only, and I ſo extreamly poor as ſhe expreſſes: where ſhould
I have rais'd 25 <hi>l.</hi> or upwards to buy the ſaid <hi>Arms,</hi> or to gratifie ſo many people?
But the queſtion is eaſily anſwered: I had the money from the Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> and
her ſelf, who were purely my Abettors and Encouragers of the Action.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>That he went to his Majeſty to pray a Warrant.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>That the King refer'd him to Mr. Secretary</hi> Coventry, <hi>who ſuſpected him and his ſhallow

the Papers which were put there by himſelf.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Never did Midwife tell a Story more ſillily than this pretended Wit of a Midw.

                  </gap>beth</hi> had
never told a tale in her life before, but that all the World knows that Goſſiping is
ſo much the ſoul of Midwifery, that 'tis impoſſible for the Profeſſion to ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it. But certainly the <hi>Devil</hi> owed her a ſhame when ſhe told this ſtory; for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man would think it a ſtrange neglect in ſelf-preſervation, (a thing to be preferr'd
before all others) ſhould one Perſon tell another that he had attempted to rob him
of his <hi>life,</hi> and that he ſtill intended the ſame, and yet that after ſo fair a warning
he ſhould ſtill be embrac'd and entertain'd as a boſom-friend, and as ſtrong a credit
as before given to his words and actions; for, by way of application, Gentlemen,
the intent of this blind ſtory, as I conceive, was only to ſhew you, that <hi>the falling
out of Lovers is the renewing of Love.</hi> She ſays we fell out, but yet ſays we fell in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and ſo She <hi>hugging</hi> the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> friend, to do the <hi>King</hi> ſervice, we became
hand and glove once more, which indeed could not well be avoided; for ſhe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the <hi>Treaſonable</hi> Papers, where they were to be laid, and what was
to be done with them, and not liking the Secretaries miſtruſt, <hi>advis'd</hi> me
<hi>to the Cuſtom-houſe way.</hi> And thus you ſee what a ſtrange way of clearing
her Innocency this Mother Midnight has found out, by confeſſing almoſt the half
of what ſhe was accus'd with; ſo that now, Gentlemen, let me have but
fair play, ſince <hi>Mrs. Elizabeth Cellier</hi> has owned one part of what was charg'd againſt
her, let her have her due, that is, let her be beleived ſo far, and then be ſo kind as to
let the Oaths of 17 or 18 Witneſſes beſides my ſelf paſs only for the reſt. I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what ſome men think, to find ſo great a <hi>Criminal</hi> owning in a Vindication thoſe
very Crimes for which ſhe was ſo calmly acquitted! ſhe wanted advice before ſhe
publiſht her Labours, for neither ſhe, nor her <hi>Rampant Dominican,</hi> have that ſame
knack of diſguiſing Truth which they think they have.</p>
            <p>Well, it appears then by her ſtory, that the Papers were conveyed into <hi>Collonel
Manſell</hi>'s Chamber; but who put them there? why, <hi>ſhe ſays in all likelyhood it was
my ſelf.</hi> Truly ſhe gueſt very right, and the reaſon was, becauſe ſhe knew it to be
ſo. But who was I? Why, a certaine <hi>Villain</hi> that at the ſame time ſhe <hi>entertain'd
in her houſe, upon an inducement to credit me.</hi> Where was now the jealouſie of <hi>woman-kind,</hi>
to truſt a quarter reconcil'd <hi>Enemy</hi> with freſh advice, upon ſuch a piece
of trepanning fraud?</p>
            <p>Thus the Confederacy continued: for though I had ſworn a deſperate oath, yet
ſhe was <hi>induc'd to credit</hi> me ſtill.</p>
            <p>Now to the <hi>Meal-tub,</hi> ſhe confeſſes the <hi>Plot</hi> was put in her <hi>Meal-tub:</hi> better two
dead <hi>Plots</hi> then one living <hi>Rat</hi> in ſuch a place: But how came it there? why I my
ſelf gave her a Paper, ſhe gave it her Maid, and the Maid put it into the <hi>Meal-tub;</hi>
who diſcover'd this <hi>Plot?</hi> not Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> you may be ſure, that was none of
her buſineſs to do; and yet no wary <hi>Woman,</hi> but having received a paper from ſuch
a <hi>Villain</hi> as I, that was to be ſo ſtrangely conceal'd, but would have taken the
Paper out of it's <hi>Mealy Coffin,</hi> and viewed it, and finding it of ſuch dangerous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
would have carried<hi>—Meal-Tub</hi> and all to <hi>Court,</hi> had the Service of
His Majeſty been the aim of her double dilligence; but it was for the Service of
her <hi>Minions,</hi> the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> an ugly <hi>Cub</hi> of her own handing into the
<hi>World,</hi> lick'd into Form and Shape by others already named; and therefore doing
no injury to any but her ſelf and her own party, what became of it? Why, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
into the <hi>Meal-Tub</hi> again, grew <hi>Mealy</hi> mouth'd, was Dough-bak'd, and ſo
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97511:5"/>
ſaid no more; I cannot ſay 'twas born mute; for it made a wicked noiſe at firſt,
very ungrateful to her Ears: But <hi>Midwives</hi> have always good <hi>Nurſes</hi> to Friends;
and they found a way to ſtill it.</p>
            <p>But now to return once more to the Letters, I muſt needs ſay what I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
forgot; that had not ſhe been well aſſiſted by ſeveral others, privy to that
Helliſh <hi>Conſpiracy</hi> indeed, as ſhe calls it <hi>(viz.</hi> the conveying the Letters into that
innocent Gentlemans Chamber) neither ſhe, nor near a ſingle <hi>Devil</hi> of them all,
could have been capable of ſuch a Contrivance; but now ſee what this innocent
<hi>Midwife</hi> has omitted to mention in the <hi>Paragraphs</hi> of the Letters, which is, <hi>(viz.)</hi>
That I ſhewed her the Letters before they were put into the Chamber, that her
ſelf, and her Co-contrivereſs, the <hi>Counteſs</hi> of <hi>Powis</hi> chaſtiſed me,</p>
            <p>Firſt, For refuſing to make <hi>Affidavit</hi> to Mr. Secretary <hi>Coventry,</hi> that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
were in Col. <hi>Manſell</hi>'s Chamber before I had put 'em there, telling me at the
ſame time I was obliged by my <hi>Religion</hi> to part with my Life for the good of
the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> much more to make an <hi>Affidavit,</hi> no matter whether true or falſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For refuſing to <hi>Murder</hi> my <hi>Gracious King</hi> and <hi>Sovereign;</hi> for which
I was alſo about the ſame time ſeverely rebuk'd by them both.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That it was by the order of the <hi>Popiſh Lords</hi> (my then Maſters) in the
<hi>Tower,</hi> not hers altogether, that I ſhould make uſe of the Cuſtom-Houſe Officers
for the ſeizing of the afore-mentioned Papers.—</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That about the ſame time when we frequently ſpoke <hi>Treaſon,</hi> ſhe
ordered me in all publick diſcourſe to call the <hi>King Lady</hi> Mary, the <hi>Duke Lady</hi>
Ann.</p>
            <p>pag. 15. But now to return to her own words, <hi>(viz.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That upon Wedneſday the <hi>22th</hi> of October, Willoughby <hi>was examined and went
upon bayle till the 24th, in which time he gave me a paper deſiring me to lay it up ſafely,
for by the help of it he hoped to defend himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it was the ſame paper which lay before Mr. Secretary</hi> Coventry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That I gave it to my Maid</hi> (Ann Blake) <hi>and ſhe put it in the Meal-Tub.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But not a word of burning Papers, or her helping me to overlook both hers and
my Study, where for half a day or better, (as the ſervants have teſtifyed) there
was ſuch tearing and burning of Letters and Pamphlets as they admired to ſee;
and that the <hi>Lady Powis</hi> her ſelf, and I, were forming a defence for me
againſt I was to attend the <hi>King</hi> and Council, till which time her <hi>cornuted
Husband</hi> and Son were bayl for me, at her requeſt; neither does ſhe mention
one word of the ſtrict charge ſhe gave the Maid for the ſecuring the Papers,
<hi>alias Meal-Tub Plot,</hi> ſo that they might be ſafe, in caſe the Houſe ſhould be ſearch'd,
becauſe they did import ſuch matter as was of too great Conſequence to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Flames; neither does ſhe tell us that that was the very original Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
from whence was taken the little Book I preſented to the <hi>Duke,</hi> wherein was
contain'd the whole <hi>Scheme,</hi> and the pretended diſcovery I had made in the <hi>Sham-Plot,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus far I have related matter of Fact and Truth, the firſt part of that which
ſhe her ſelf has only diſguiſed, no way fairly contradicted, in that <hi>Mealy</hi> Pack of
Lyes, which ſhe has called <hi>Mallice Defeated:</hi> And now I ſhall come to a ſecond
part, which ſhe either evades in an elaborate manner, or with down right impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
denies, <hi>viz.</hi>

Pag. 17. <hi>That</hi> Willoughby <hi>ſent for</hi> Suſan Edwards <hi>my Servant, to the Priſon,
(after he was committed by the King and Councel) by whom he ſent me a long
Epiſtle, how he had been tortured that Night, then I ſent him again this following
Note.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have ſaid you were taken into my Houſe to get in deſperate Debts—
They bring me to <hi>L. S.</hi> they will ask me who encouraged me to go to him, I
will ſay it was you, it cannot worſt you.</p>
            <p>To this I deny that I ever ſent to her till the Maid came firſt to me; with a
Letter from her Miſtreſs, wherein ſhe told me the <hi>Counteſs</hi> of <hi>Powis</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
her to bid me be of good Courage, and I ſhould be removed to the
<hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> and be well provided for: That her Lady-ſhip would make im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Application to four or five <hi>Great men,</hi> who ſhould ſoon do my buſineſs,
to this ſhe deſired my Anſwer, the Contents of which I am not obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
but probably I might mention, in the ſame, ſomething of the torture
I had undergone the night paſt, and the dread of worſe for the night to come,
but ſhe willingly miſtakes what I meant by <hi>Torture,</hi> for 'twas not ſuch a ſort
which ſhe ſeems to repreſent to the <hi>World,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Irons</hi> or <hi>Cords,</hi> but 'twas the
horror of an evil <hi>Conſcience</hi> laſht in every part with crimes of the deepeſt hew,
which ſhe and her accomplices had engaged me in; for to uſe her own words,
where ſhe ſayes, when ſhe firſt fetcht me out of Priſon, <hi>he expreſt
much ſorrow for his paſt Crimes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 8.</note> 
               <hi>and made great Proteſtations of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
amendment,</hi> it was that which indeed I had done, and was
fixed for a reformed Life, and did intend to have undertaken <hi>a Pilgrimage to</hi>
St. <hi>Jago,</hi> but what by her often attacks on the one ſide, and the <hi>Devil's</hi> her
grand Aſſociate, on the other, that Reſolution proved but a Prologue to the
worſt <hi>Tragedy</hi> I ever was engaged in, which was the real occaſion of the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
which ſhe expreſſes, though not explains, a good part of which miſchiefs
are to be incluſively underſtood in the Letter which ſhe ſayes, her Maid brought
me ſoon after, wherein ſhe uſes theſe words, <hi>I have ſaid you were taken into my
Houſe, to get in deſperate Debts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How like an excuſe this looks let the <hi>World</hi> Judge, or let her but rove, by
any one of her Husbands Debtors, who is an unbias'd man, that I ever treated
with him to any ſuch purpoſe, I will give her the conqueſt; if not, both my
ſelf, and the whole <hi>

has been from her Cradle, a moſt notorious lying <hi>Doxey,</hi> who having once
made uſe of a Lye for an excuſe, tells it ſo often, that with her ſelf, it becomes
a currant truth.</p>
            <p>She knew very well I was cut out, neither for a <hi>Broaker,</hi> nor a <hi>Solicitor,</hi> and
that thoſe plodding employments were no way ſuitable to my more <hi>Airy
Genius;</hi> and therefore the excuſe of her deſperate Debts, was as deſperate as her
Debts, ſome of which were ſo deſperate, that I am fully perſwaded ſhe never
had any ſuch. Is it for any man of reaſon to imagine a Woman, that was
Building <hi>Caſtles</hi> in the <hi>Air,</hi> Dreamt of nothing but <hi>Maxims</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> and was
deſigning to be a <hi>Counteſs</hi> on Earth, and a <hi>Saint</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> ever thought of ſuch
Trifles, as deſperate Debts? 'Twas an excuſe that never will be believed, and
therefore it was very Femininely done, to put ſuch an over-ridden ſtale pretence
upon the <hi>Nation.</hi> Come, come, Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> your Ramping Dominican, had
no mind to hide your nakedneſs, but only to throw a <hi>Tiffaney</hi> Vindication over it,
rather by contraction to diſplay, than cover the proſpect: Where, by my advice

Practices of thoſe People, who firſt inſinuate themſelves into the good opinion
of one they intend an Inſtrument in their Black (or as they call it, the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
Cauſe, then gradually engage him to act in their Deſignes, and when
over Head and Eares, or catcht by a Diſcovery, prevail with him to take all
upon himſelf, perſwading him by the Inſinuations of ſome <hi>Prieſt,</hi> it is <hi>Merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi>
ſo to do: And that if he be <hi>Sentenced</hi> to <hi>Death</hi> he ſhall have a <hi>Pardon,</hi> but
alas when it comes to that, good night <hi>Nicholas,</hi> then there's nothing to be
done, but to ſend his betrayed <hi>Soul</hi> to the <hi>Devil,</hi> and to keep a conſtant Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to hold him ſteady, till he comes to be Executed, binding themſelves by
bitter Vows and Execrations, that he ſhall be Saved, and that ſuch things muſt
be deferred till the laſt Minute, to keep others of leſs Faith right, whereas if
a man ſhould make any Diſcovery, why then, 'tis all Lyes, was not the Rope
about his Neck? he did it to ſave his life, he is a <hi>Villain</hi> and a Stigmatized Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and a thouſand ſuch pretences, and therefore can be no Lawful Witneſs;
but if a man, by ſuch delayes, will ſilently devote himſelf to the Halter with a
Lye in his Mouth, why then, his death is brought in Competition with the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
of the living, and Hirelings muſt be employed to diſperſe their lying
Speeches with new Additions, and to ſpread rumours throughout the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,</hi>
to prepoſſeſs the more <hi>Charitable</hi> people, that they knew nothing of the
matters laid to their charge, but dyed innocently, and wrongfully, and indeed,
that the people muſt not believe, there either was or is any ſuch thing as a <hi>Popiſh

better able to make it out to their Faces.</p>
            <p>But to return to the former matter, our Lying <hi>Jezabel</hi> would once in her

who it was ſent her to the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> though I am clearly of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

            <p>Pag. 18. <hi>November the</hi> 1ſt. <hi>before His Majeſty and the Lords of the Councel,</hi>
Willoughby <hi>accuſed me of all the forged Stories he tells in his lying Narrative; and
I unfeignedly told the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What ſhe meant by the word Truth is much to be diſputed, as being a thing
altogether eloign'd both from her practice and profeſſion; I am apt to believe
ſhe lighted upon the word by accident, as the Gentleman did, when he prayed
to <hi>Cupid</hi> in the words of the <hi>Common-prayer-book, O thou whoſe ſervice is perfect
freedom:</hi> For my part I cannot otherwiſe conjecture what ſhe intended, unleſs
it were her owning a great part of what I charged her with, at the ſame time;
for, as for thoſe which ſhe calls Truths, it is ſuch a ſort of Truth, that neither
any of the <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Councel,</hi> nor any other Perſon whatſoever, that I ever
yet heard of, allowed it as ſuch, (her own Party excepted;) ſo that it can be
no other than the Venome of an unhang'd <hi>Dominican,</hi> and her own lying
Tongue.</p>
            <p>Pag. 19. <hi>Willoughby was brought to a Window over againſt me (in the Priſon)
to talk with me;</hi> where note ſhe ſays I diſcours'd her to this effect, <hi>(viz.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Madam, pray ſpeak low, and tell me how you do, and do not diſcompoſe your ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am ſorry for your confinement: I could not help what I have done, you ſhall not
die; nor receive any other hurt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Look here how I have been uſed, and then ſhewed me his Arms, ſaying, he had been
miſerably tormented, and was forc'd to accuſe me and others to ſave his own life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That he had told the King more than he could make out, and was forc'd to joyn with
Confederates to get his pardon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Madam, there are two perſons found that will lay worſe things to your Charge,
than I have done, therefore come in while it is time, and joyn with the moſt powerful,
you may make your own conditions; then he ſaid that the King was bought and ſold,
and here would be a Republick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Duke would be deſtroyed in</hi> Scotland.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That if I would ſay the Duke gave me the Original of thoſe Papers that were
found in my Meal-Tub, and bid me cauſe them to be put into</hi> Manſels <hi>Chamber, and
kill the Earl of</hi> Shaftsbury, <hi>that then I ſhould have a Pardon, and more Money
than all the Witneſſes had had together; for the Earl of</hi> Shaftsbury, <hi>and the reſt of
the Confederate Lords, would raiſe Ten Thouſand Pounds, which I ſhould paſs over by
Bills of Exchange.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That I ſhould have twenty Pounds per week ſetled on me by Act of Parliament as
long as I lived: And if I would do all this, ſome Perſon of Honour ſhould come and
treat with me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pag. 21. <hi>That he ſhewed me his Arms, where the Irons or Cords had worn off
the skin, telling me he had been wrack'd, and cruelly us'd to force him to accuſe
me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That he ask'd me, if I thought other Perſons, whom he had accus'd, would forgive
him; as well as my ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That he told me he would write down all the intreague, with the Names of thoſe
Lords and others that ſet him on work, and give it me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:97511:7"/>
               <hi>Next morning he was at his Window by day-break, and propos'd if I would not belye
the Duke, to ſay the Earl of</hi> Peterborough <hi>gave me thoſe Papers, and that I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a Thouſand Pounds in Gold of Sir</hi> Allen Apſley, <hi>to pay him for the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
of the Earl of</hi> Shaftsbury, <hi>and to raiſe Soldiers againſt the King,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to all this Chriſtening Goſſipry, we are firſt to conſider the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of theſe matters, and handle them with the more care and ſcrutiny, in
regard here are divers <hi>Noble-Peers</hi> under her Female reproaches; a thing ſtrangely
to be wondered at, that the Preſs ſhould be ſo open, for ſcandals againſt the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi>
and ſo cloſely barricadoed againſt what would have been more truly ſaid
againſt Perſons far leſs conſiderable.</p>
            <p>The forgoing diſcourſe, as ſhe ſays, paſs'd from me to her, at the time
when we were both under confinement: A Lye not only of the more monſtrous
ſort, but alſo impoſſible; for, as to my part, I was a cloſe <hi>Priſoner</hi> at the top
of all <hi>the Priſon,</hi> by a ſpecial Order, and that from the time of my <hi>recantation,</hi>
till I had finiſhed my <hi>Depoſitions;</hi> and I have been ſince credibly inform'd, ſhe
was not committed to <hi>Newgate</hi> till within a very ſhort time before I was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd;
and I have been alſo inform'd, that ſhe was committed cloſe Priſoner,
and kept ſo a conſiderable time (after I was diſcharg'd) in <hi>Captain Richardſon</hi>'s
Houſe, who for divers reaſons ought <hi>to uſe her with reſpect:</hi> And therefore how
I could communicate any thing to her, in <hi>Captain Richardſons</hi> Houſe; from the
top of <hi>Newgate,</hi> either of that or any other nature, I refer to ſuch as beſt know
<hi>the Priſon,</hi> and the apartments, which have <hi>a Yard,</hi> called the <hi>Preſs-yard,</hi> and
divers Rooms between them, and ſhall alſo have my Faith upon't, that there
was nothing of a <hi>Speaking-Trumpet</hi> in the caſe; but on the other ſide I muſt
confeſs, at that time the intimacy which had for ſome conſiderable time before
been between us, was freſh in memory, and that would have gone a great way
with me, could I poſſibly have come near her, but not to have inſiſted upon,
as ſhe pretends, but to have directed her Prayers to the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> (who
had opened my Eyes) to have done the ſame by her, that ſhe might have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
a true Proſpect of the evil conſequences, wherein ſhe had embroyl'd both
her ſelf and me, and ingeniouſly to have diſcover'd them to the <hi>World;</hi> not
that I could have wanted her Teſtimony to confirm mine, but for her own
Soul's ſake: And beſides, admit ſhe had been ſo wicked to have accus'd any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Perſon, as ſhe pretends I requeſted her to do, how far it would have
been concurrent with my Teſtimony, let the <hi>World</hi> judge; for whereas ſhe
ſays, I requeſted her to accuſe the <hi>Duke</hi> of being privy to the conveying the
Meal-Tub Papers into <hi>Collonel</hi> Manſels <hi>Chamber, and bid her kill the Earl of</hi> Shaftſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,
nothing could be more improbable, in regard the World ſees I never yet
mentioned one tittle to that purpoſe in all my Depoſitions; and beſides, the
Papers that we put into Collonel <hi>Manſels</hi> Chamber, imported matters of a clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
different nature from thoſe of the <hi>Meal-Tub.</hi> Therefore 'tis ſtrange, that
I ſhould be ſo idle, as to propoſe a thing of that deteſtable conſequence to her,
that would no ways amount to the leaſt tittle of ſervice to my ſelf, unleſs ſhe
as a Confederate, had encouraged me to it, and ſupplied me from her wonted
Fountain: And then what ſhould have hindered, but that I might have repeal'd
that as well as other things? And farther, that which is ſtill more improbable,
is, that I deſired her to ſay, <hi>ſhe received a Thouſand Pounds in Gold from Sir</hi> Allen
Apſly, <hi>to pay me for the Murthering the Earl of</hi> Shaftsbury, <hi>and to raiſe Forces againſt
the King,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:97511:7"/>
A thing I mention no where, nor did I ever charge her with being the
Perſon which was to pay me for that; for one <hi>Ricaut a Virginia Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,</hi>
and her great Familiar, was to pay me <hi>Five Hundred Pounds</hi> for the
<hi>Murthering</hi> the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> according to the appointment of the
<hi>Lords</hi> in the <hi>Tower.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for her lame invention of my being <hi>tortur'd</hi> with Cords or Irons,
'tis directly falſe, and ſuch a like Lye as that of Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> or one <hi>Coral</hi>
a <hi>Coachman,</hi> which ſhe tells of in her third Page; but if both her ſelf, and
my ſelf, and indeed every ſuch wicked miſcreant, had been worſe tortur'd
than what ſhe has expreſt, yet it would have been far ſhort of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts.</p>
            <p>Pag. 20. <hi>She ſays,</hi> (viz.) <hi>God is merciful, and if I live, I may repent,
I was deſerted by every body, and if I had not been hang'd, I ſhould have been
ſtarved; it is a ſad thing to depend upon an ungrateful and diſunited people, I
have reaſon to take ſome care of my ſelf; thoſe I belong to now, are very kind
to me, and ſend me great encouragements, I ſhall have a pardon, and be ſet at
liberty; but before I go, I would be glad you would conſider your own condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>To this no man has more to ſay than my ſelf, for I have been all my life
time delivered by the <hi>Mercies</hi> and great <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of the <hi>All-ſeeing God,</hi>
whom I bleſs particularly for my laſt great deliverance from among that
Infernal Crew; and reſtoring me to his <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Favour,</hi> in which, by
his <hi>Infinite mercy,</hi> I will abide to the laſt minute of my life, rather than
be again corrupted for the greateſt advantages, that <hi>ungrateful diſunited</hi>
Pack, as ſhe calls them, can propoſe to me; for however vicious my paſt
life has been, the amendment only time will produce, and I make no
doubt, but that it will prove to the general ſatisfaction of all ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in the converſion of a <hi>Sinner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then he ſhewed me Gold, and told me great advantages were to be made by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
the Kings Evidence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the word Encouragement I am intended for ſome <hi>Ridicule,</hi> as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
for all perſons may eaſily know what encouragement I have met
with; yet nevertheleſs there is no man can ſay I have expreſt the leaſt
impatience for my ſufferings. The Gold ſhe ſpeaks of, would, no doubt,
have been as welcome to my Pockets, as to another mans, (could I have
juſtified the occaſion of earning it) where perhaps it might have met with
an old hoarded piece, which Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had us'd twice, as a Contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Piece, upon <hi>Marriage</hi> of <hi>two Husbands;</hi> but to prevent any ſuch far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
uſe, was by her preſented to a certain young <hi>Spaniard,</hi> ſome time
ſince, as an Earneſt-Peny for his good Service, who intends it a Preſent,
wherewith to tip the <hi>Cornudoes</hi> Horns, if he'l take the pains to come or
ſend his kind Wife into the City to fetch it.</p>
            <p>Pag. 21. <hi>That about twelve days before</hi> Dangerfield <hi>was taken, he told me
my Name was entred into Sir</hi> William Waller's <hi>Black Bill, and therefore
he adviz'd me to write to the Earl of</hi> Shaftsbury: <hi>I told him I durſt
not do that, but would go to his Lordſhip, and then I deſired him to go with
me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is another plain acknowledgment; for I muſt confeſs, that that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
time ſhe did requeſt me to go with her; but I then being under a moſt
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97511:8"/>
dreadful diſcompoſure of mind, out of a deep apprehenſion of the fatal er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand,
upon which I had been there twice before, was not to be drawn
thither again, which backwardneſs of mine was the reaſon <hi>ſhe her ſelf of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to go, and do the work</hi> I was intended for, in <hi>plain Engliſh,</hi> to <hi>kill</hi> his
<hi>Lordſhip,</hi> which was all the buſineſs ſhe had there.</p>
            <p>But being daſh'd in the face with the foul Guilt of a terrifying Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
ſhe came away (to uſe her own words) <hi>without any ſucceſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Stories of <hi>Jacob Clement</hi> and <hi>Ravillac</hi> had intoxicated her courage;
but when ſhe ſaw it was a Man ſhe was to <hi>kill,</hi> ſhe could not find in her
heart to injure the Sex ſhe loved ſo well.</p>
            <p>Pag. 29. <hi>In</hi> January <hi>I was brought before the Committee of Lords, where</hi>
Dangerfield <hi>was asked, if I did not ſet him on to create a mutiny at the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow
Coffee-houſe; to which he replied, I cannot ſay ſhe ſet me on. That I was
angry with him for it, bid him be gone out of my houſe, and removed his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
into the Garret for that cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Mutiny, the remark I have made of it already is ſufficient;
but how ſhe could be angry with me, for ſo good a piece of ſervice, as
that was like to prove, is as probable, as her putting <hi>me out of her houſe, by
removing my Quarters into the Garret,</hi> as ſhe pretends, which ſhe could not
find in her heart howſoever to do, as being a Place very unfit for the inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
and near correſpondence we then held; and beſides, a Place only fit
to receive a Lackey, and which ſhe ought not in Conſcience to have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to a—<hi>&amp;c.</hi> that pay'd no leſs at that time than eight ſhillings
a week for a more convenient Lodging, in the ſame houſe, and four ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
ſix penee <hi>per</hi> week for one much more convenient than either of them
at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That I being examin'd about a Walk, that was upon Tower-wharf, with the
Lord</hi> C. J. <hi>and the Lady</hi> Powis, <hi>and offering Ten Thouſand Pounds concerning
Sir</hi> George Wakeman, <hi>made this reply, Yes, my Lords, I read it in a Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet;</hi>
which Pamphlet was printed ſome where in <hi>China</hi> in the <hi>two and
twenty thouſandth</hi> Year of the <hi>World,</hi> and ſhewed to her in one of St. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minick</hi>'s
Viſions, for after all the enquiry I have made, I never could meet
with one Perſon, who ever ſaw any ſuch Pamphlet beſides her ſelf: And
thus the <hi>Trully</hi> at <hi>Newgate,</hi> being ask'd where they had their purloyn'd
Booty? cry, They found it. Such was the impudence of this Woman,
rather to Droll with, than anſwer the (Demands of the Councel; which
made them look upon her only as a bold and incorrigible Bigott.</p>
            <p>Pag. 23. <hi>If any thing in the World could give a probable light where the
true Plot is managed, mine and my accuſers Caſes would do it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed I am much of the ſame opinion, for your very Defence accuſes
you; and there is no Queſtion to be made, but tho management of your
deliverance was as convincing an Argument to all Perſons of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
how the true <hi>Plot</hi> was managed, as might appear by your ſoft and
gentle, and your Accuſers harſh and undeſerved uſage, which are the true
Caſes of you and your Accuſer.</p>
            <p>Ibid. <hi>That ſingly and alone, without the advice or aſſiſtance of any one Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Man or Woman, I was left to ſtudy, manage, and ſupport my ſelf, to my
own expence which above a thouſand Pounds, never receiving one Peny towards
it, but ten Pounds given me by a condemn'd Prieſt, five days before my</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:97511:8"/>
               <hi>Tryal, nor have I ſince received any thing, or the leaſt civility from
them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Madam, this Rodomontado will not paſs, as being a meer bundle of
Lies and Equivocations, which they of your acquaintance, that know
better, cannot but bluſh to hear you tell, as if you were pratling over
your Sack and Sugar, and others that believe, may as well believe the
Story of <hi>Bell</hi> and the <hi>Dragon.</hi> You would fain be Sainted for your
Merits, which has produc'd this extravagant Huff of yours, and ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
you may, as that <hi>Strumpet</hi> the <hi>Egyptian</hi> St. <hi>Mary;</hi> ſo Famous in
your Callender for expoſing her Body to relieve the neceſſities of the <hi>Holy
Monks</hi> and <hi>Hermites</hi> of her time.</p>
            <p>As for the expence ſhe mentions, I take it for granted, and the only
Truth ſhe ever told in her whole Life, but that thoſe expences came
out of her needy Pocket, I utterly deny; for ſurely her Midwives
Fees can never be imagin'd to have been able to bear the expences
that amounted to much above a <hi>Thouſand Pounds;</hi> which argues the
falſehood of her Aſſertion in this Particular; for indeed things of that
Nature, are not to be managed at the expence of a Midwives Purſe, nor
does it look with the Face of Innocent or ordinary conduct, as ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends,
for here are matters of divers kinds, ſuch as wanted the ſupport
of good Friends, or the <hi>Devil</hi> himſelf, who is ſaid to be the <hi>God</hi> of
Riches.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mammon</hi> himſelf was only able to feed thoſe greedy Mercenaries that
ſuck'd the Canvas Teats of her <hi>Charity,</hi> who by that means were made
fit Inſtruments for her and her Confederates, and then the <hi>Devil</hi> came in
to act his part, which was to ſtock them with fit Creatures, ſo that by
the loſs of one, three might be produc'd by way of freſh ſupply; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I give the more credit to the expence ſhe mentions; and am apt to
think it not much ſhort of one of the like nature, which was Sir <hi>George,
Wakemans</hi> Caſe, which how fitly this Woman or her Husband were
quallified in <hi>ſtate</hi> to manage, I refer to all that know them: Therefore
in all probability there was a General Contribution, to make good that
breach; for it was a cloſe attack, which if loſt, would have ſhook tho
whole work, without <hi>making the Kingdom rue it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to my own Sex I hope they will Pardon the Errors of my Story, as well as
thoſe bold attempts of mine that occaſion'd it, ſince what I medled with, though
it may be thought too Maſculine yet was it the effects of my more than Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Zeal to gain Proſelytes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And no one can truly ſay, but that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
the Modeſty,</hi> though not the timorouſneſs, common to my Sex.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Religious Zeal</hi> and <hi>Modeſty! Jeſu Maria!</hi> what a preſident of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
is here? we ſhall have ſhortly, by the example of this Midwife,
the whole Town fill'd with Vindications by all the <hi>Trulls</hi> in <hi>Whetſtones-Park</hi>
and all the Lewd Corners in the <hi>Suburbs;</hi> we ſhall have ſuch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
of Fame, and good Name and Honor among the Common
<hi>Harlots,</hi> that Women that are truly honeſt will be aſham'd to own it.
Well—This Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth Cellier</hi> has a ſtupendious <hi>Memory:</hi> I had
thought, ſeeing it was ſo long ago, that ſhe had forgot the Practice
of <hi>Religious Zeal</hi> and <hi>Modeſty,</hi> that ſhe had forgot the very words; but
I ſee ſhe has not: However Gentlemen, ſince ſhe has been ſo nimble
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97511:9"/>
with my <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Converſation,</hi> I will give you a <hi>Compendium</hi> of hers;
And then you ſhall be Judges of her <hi>Religious Zeal</hi> and <hi>Modeſty,</hi> your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>The way then ſhe hath taken for many years to preſerve her <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty,</hi>
as ſhe calls it, hath been the greateſt Forfeiture of it, and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
the worſt Reflections upon her Morals, that ever any of the Sex has
had made upon them.</p>
            <p>For about Twenty years ſince, ſhe then being the Wife of a certain
<hi>Merchant</hi> of this <hi>City,</hi> did as ſhe ſayes, by accident receive into her Houſe
a Comely <hi>Italian</hi> by the Name of <hi>Seignior Pedro de Viacho;</hi> who had to
attend him, a <hi>Negro</hi> as Charming in her Eye, as his Maſter; at one and
the ſame time ſhe fell in Love with them both, to that degree, that it
expos'd her to publick report, which the <hi>Seignior</hi> being inform'd of,
made immediate Application to the Lady, and ſoon confirm'd the report
for Truth; ſome time after, the ſight of the <hi>Black</hi> one day at Dinner, as
he waited on his Maſter, ſo ſuddenly made a deep impreſſion in her
Heart, that ſhe was taken moſt violently ill of a <hi>Love Paſſion,</hi> which
ſhe for the ſpace of Ten days underwent with great impatience, but
having in this time watch'd all opportunities, one <hi>Evening</hi> by Twilight,
when the <hi>Seignior</hi> and her Husband were at a <hi>Tavern,</hi> ſhe took the <hi>Black</hi>
into her Chamber; where having allow'd him more Freedom than his
Heart could wiſh for, ſhe gratified her own <hi>Laſcivious</hi> deſire. And ſuch op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
ſhe often made uſe of, inſomuch, that both the Husband
and the <hi>Seignior</hi> were Jealous of the <hi>Moore,</hi> for the <hi>Rogue</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
fond, and could not forbear to expreſs great Demonſtrations
thereof at ſeveral times when he was in her Company; ſo that a little
time produc'd the Effects of her Intimacy, for this paſſionate Lady fell
in Travail, and in ſome ſhort time, and with no great difficulty, was
out of her <hi>Religious Zeal</hi> deliver'd of a brave <hi>Tawny Face'd Boy,</hi> to the
great amazement of all the beholders. This made a terrible noiſe among
the Neighborhood: So that the <hi>Seignior</hi> being a man of ſome repute,
and not enduring to hear ſuch <hi>Reproaches</hi> as he often met with, pack'd up
his Tackling and departed for <hi>Rome,</hi> the Husband being overborn with
grief, ſoon after departed for <hi>Legorne,</hi> where he became a Factor and
ended his days. How ſhe ſpent her time for Three or Four years after I
know not; but about Twelve years ſince, ſhe lived near <hi>Holbourn,</hi> and
was then become very exquiſite at the Cracking Trade, from thence ſhe
removed to a certain Lodging in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where ſhe met with a
Second Husband as ſhe ſayes, hearing the firſt was dead, By the Second
ſhe had divers Children, and whilſt he lived was not much expos'd,
but the <hi>World</hi> in time (thorough her extravagancy no doubt on't)
Frown'd on him, and he departed for the <hi>Barbadoes</hi> where he dyed,
After this ſhe was ſcarce young enough to be a <hi>Whore,</hi> and ſcarce old
enough to practice <hi>Bawding;</hi> ſo that for ſome years ſhe turn'd <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureſs</hi>
(as ſhe her ſelf has often told me, to a certain great
Perſon) by which ſhe recovered her ſelf, and then return'd
to Houſe-keeping, and in Two years had gathered together,
a very devout <hi>Convent</hi> of Beautiful ſtrapping young Daughters,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97511:9"/>
of joy, whoſe remote practice at the Wells in the Country, and elſewhere
in three or four years repleniſh't her Purſe; But finding the great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
of ſuch a conſtant Reſort of Doctors, Pimps, Bullyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to her
houſe, and the great threats ſhe had often undergone, of being ſent to <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>
for a Bawd, ſhe removed into the City of <hi>London;</hi> where, being by
her abſence become a Stranger, ſhe ſet up, and profeſt the Craft of <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery;</hi>
ſtill now and then by the By entertaining a young Courtizan for
the ſpace of a Month or ſo, during the time of Delivery.</p>
            <p>This Trade was in a ſhort time diſcovered by the Neighbourhood, and
as ſoon by the Prentices, who, had not the requeſt of ſome particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
prevail'd, did intend to have made a <hi>Shrove-Tueſday</hi> invaſion upon her
<hi>Inchanted Caſtle.</hi> Yet, notwithſtanding all this, ſhe had cunning enough to
inſinuate her ſelf into the Affections of one Mr. <hi>Cellier</hi> a French Merchant,
and by degrees prevail'd with him to marry her, to the great lamentation
of all his Children and Relations.</p>
            <p>Some time after, ſhe removed to <hi>Arundel-ſtreet,</hi> the place where ſhe now
lives, and then undertook to Sollicit the Good-mans buſineſs; during which
time, partly by her modeſt compliance with Laſcivious Requeſts, and partly
by compulſion, ſhe raiſed the Eſtate, and recovered a good part of it into
their own hands, which produced a plentiful livelihood, together with the
help of her moving hand. In all which time there was ſtill room to be
found for a <hi>Gallant;</hi> for the Good-man was aged, and conſequently trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with the uſual infirmities of his Years. This ſort of Life held for three
or four years, ſtill turning out and taking into favour freſh Gallants, and
among the reſt a young <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who after ſome large demonſtrations of
his Abilities, was received into favour. It ſeems at firſt he did not perform
his part of Complacency ſo well as was expected; but in time, being apt,
he was ſoon fit for the purpoſe, after having undergone ſome correction, and
received ſome inſtructions from her ſelf, ſuch as the School of <hi>Venus,</hi> &amp;c.
So that in a little time, the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had made her ſenſible of divers New
Tranſports, ſuch, as ſhe declared in her whole Life-time ſhe had been a
ſtranger to before, as you may gueſs by the following Letters, ſent to
the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who was her Agent in buſineſs of a difficult Nature here in
<hi>London,</hi> when ſhe was at a place called <hi>Peterſley</hi> in <hi>Buckinghamſhire.</hi>

                  <p>THIS Morning about four a Clock, I awaked, and by the help of the Light
I diſcovered my ſelf in the Arms of a dull and drouſie Husband, but my
expectations were not anſwered by the uſual enjoyments which onght to have atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that hour, ſo that forc't I was to be ſilent, and only divert my ſelf by wiſhing
my <hi>Spaniard</hi> here. I received Yours with great difficulty, and my Husband
would have read it, but I told him, it was buſineſs concerned the <hi>L. P.</hi> but I read
it with great content; and as ſoon as I return, I do reſolve to try the effects of
a ſhort abſence. I am very uneaſie when I eat or ſleep; I think I dream of you.
Your company is more dear to me, then a thouſand Husbands: What is the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

                  <p>I Did by great accident meet the Meſſenger, and my Husband was very near

before he came to me; I proteſt it has ſo pleas'd me, that I reſolve to be in Town
to morrow ſevennight. Give me the man of Conduct, that can turn and wind

I fear nothing but that I ſhall not prevail with this Old Fond Fool to
ſtay behind me; and if he does, 'twill not be for above a Week, ſo that we will
make the moſt of the Time. If you can take a Coach and meet me four or five

            <p>Theſe two Letters by accident miſcarried by her own miſtaking the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſcriptions,
and were ſent to two Ladies of Quality, who well knew the
hand writing, and therefore no doubt bluſht ſufficiently in the reading 'em,
but yet did not forget to expoſe them as far as they thought fit, ſo that
now the Intrigue being diſcovered by her own bad Conduct, ſhe made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
to the Ladies, and ſo obtained the Letters, which let her deny if
ſhe can.</p>
            <p>Many other pretty cloſe paſſages I could relate, but I ſhall reſerve ſome
for another time; And doubt not but this will demonſtrate to the world
how modeſt a Creature ſhe is, and how much ſhe deſerves the charitable
opinion of a Religious Zealot.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> ſhe tells us <hi>pag.</hi> 43. <hi>That on Wedneſday the eighteenth of</hi>
Auguſt, <hi>I appear'd before the Lords of the Council, and did then accuſe Sir</hi>
William Waller, Manſell <hi>and</hi> Dangerfield <hi>of High Treaſon, and offered to
make good my Charge; but by delayes I loſt the opportunity of meeting the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
(my Witneſſes), and could not examine the principal Part that day, and
by the next he was taken ſpeechleſs, as he ſtill continues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That ſhe did accuſe me of High Treaſon, is a thing unknown to me;
but I know ſhe might well enough do it, for ſhe had engaged me in Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
enough to hang a hundred, and therefore 'twas ſtrange if ſhe could not
find enough to charge one with. But now whether ſhe or I were the firſt
Impeachers, that every body knows, but how we ſhould both own a Fact
of that nature publickly to the world, and yet both eſcape hanging, I
know not, farther then as to my own part, as having by the Grace and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97511:10"/>
ſpecial Favour of my Sovereign received my Pardon. As for the delays
ſhe pretends that hindred her making good her Accuſation, they might well
enough be; for ſhe ſaith, the Gentleman her Witneſs was taken <hi>Speechleſs,</hi>
a thing ſomewhat ſtrange (and that no Miracle could be done to ſet him
right again) and to me, perhaps a deliverance.</p>
            <p>Here may the World ſee how the Judgements of God trod upon the
heels of ſome curſed Deſign; for my Accuſation was only the introducto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
part; but how many others might have been Shipwrackt by that black
ſilenc'd Mouth, God knows: And therefore in his good time, he ſtopt it
with a terrible Judgement. And Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> has expos'd it to the World,
as I pray all the reſt may be in time: ſhe wanted nothing but that Great or
Ragamuffions Teſtimony to make good the charge; and for want of it, our
Midwife was repulſt, by this following Expreſſion, <hi>(viz.) You muſt not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to make Diſcoveries here, unleſs you can make them out plainer, as for your
ſelf we believe not a word you ſay,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That upon his ſingle Evidence the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs
of</hi> Powis, <hi>Lord</hi> Caſtlemain, <hi>my Self and other conſiderable perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
were committed to Priſon.</hi> What a fine Reflection is this upon the <hi>King</hi>
and <hi>Council,</hi> as if right or wrong they had been committed by my ſingle
Evidence. No, 'twas not ſo; for 'tis a plain Argument, that both the <hi>King</hi>
and <hi>Council</hi> were well ſatisfied with a conſiderable deal of coroborating
Teſtimony in my Diſcovery, before that hapned, or indeed any commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
otherwiſe I queſtion, whether my Neck ſhould not have been in as
great jeopardy, as hers now is.</p>
            <p>As for the Treaſonable Practices ſhe mentions ſworn againſt me by
Mr. <hi>Foſter,</hi> a Juſtice of the Peace, it was juſt ſuch another piece of vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany
as her own, wherein he accuſes himſelf, not me; which may, perhaps,
be known ſooner than he thinks of. But every perſon is capable of accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
others of Treaſon, according to this account, no matter whether true
or falſe; as you may ſee in ſome Diſcourſe which paſt at the (Lord <hi>Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main</hi>'s
Tryal) <hi>In theſe Times no man knows when he is ſafe from the Perjuries
which ſo much abound, we have men grown ſo inſolent now adays, that upon what
account, or what ſort of confidence to tearm it, I know not, run at whole Societies
of men, and perſons of all Qualities, as if there were any thing in their Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
could render them better, then their own villainous Actions proclaim them
to be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis an eaſie matter to ſwear a man out of his Life, if ſuch perſons might
be admitted, and I believe the Devil has ſent ſuch men abroad, to render
Truth ridiculous, and for to fill the World with nothing but Lyes and
Perjuries; but be it known to the World, that a man of a <hi>profligate life,</hi>
though neceſſity might expoſe him to Rob, yet is as tender of a faiſe Oath,
as thoſe who pretend more largely to honeſty and modeſty; and without
going any farther, I think this may ſerve, That when I waited on Mr. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
<hi>Coventry</hi> for a Warrant (on which the ſtreſs of the whole <hi>Sham Plot</hi>
lay) he refuſed it, unleſs I would make <hi>Affidavit,</hi> and I refuſed ſo to do,
becauſe it would have been folly: for the Truth of which I refer my ſelf
to that Honourable Perſon. Now 'tis very ſtrange that a man who had
but one ſingle ſtep to make, to the aggrandizing himſelf, and he being one
who could ſo eaſily digeſt falſe Oaths, as they ſeem to render me, ſhould
be ſo ſqueamiſh as to boggle at one ſingle Oath, and ſo conſequently loſe
the great opportunity of making my Fortune; but I bleſs my God, who
hath always preſerved my Thoughts free from ſuch Villanies, and I hope,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97511:11"/>
and it is my dayly Prayers, that I may become as ſerviceable for my King
and Country, as I have been againſt them.</p>
            <p>As for Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi>'s expoſing me to the World, and the Enlargements
which ſhe has made of her own, I value them no longer, as being oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
upon Earth, and I hope, forgiv'n in Heaven. Yet of all Women un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Skie, ſhe had the leaſt Reaſon to take notice of them. For had
not I been taken for what ſhe makes me to be, ſhe had certainly been e're
this either in <hi>Purgatory,</hi> or elſe in a worſe place. There was no way to
ſave her, but by making me ten times worſe then I was: So that ſhe ought
to have prais'd the Bridge ſhe went over; and to have the greateſt vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
imaginable for my Crimes, which were the only Engines made uſe
of for her Deliverance; which nevertheleſs would never have prevail'd,
had they not been in the hands of <hi>Artiſts,</hi> that knew very well how to
uſe them to the beſt advantage.</p>
            <p>And ſo, Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth Cellier, Adieu</hi> for this time. You may go on, if
you pleaſe, and write another <hi>APOLOGY</hi> to the people upon the
occaſion of this <hi>ANSWER.</hi>
