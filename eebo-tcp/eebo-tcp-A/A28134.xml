         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Warning unto the City of London, and
the Suburbs round about, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>O The day and hour of thy Visitation is now, O
City of <hi>London!</hi> with all thy Suburbs, and
likewise the day, hour, and time of Gods righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Judgements is at hand, and will be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
upon thee in flames of fire from heaven:
O my soul mourneth for thee, and my bowels
is troubled, and my heart is pained within me, to see thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation,
my eyes runneth down as a Fountain for the misery
that is overtaking thee: O the fury of the Lord! it is terrible,
and who may stand, when it waxeth hot, and burneth as a fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
fire: O repent, repent, repent! for thy wickedness sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth
the wickedness of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> thy pride
and ambition far exceedeth <hi>Jerusalems: Jerusalem</hi> had one
Temple to worship in, and it was commanded of the Lord to
be built, and the Lord commanded them to worship in it;
but according to your imaginations, so is your worship, and as
your streets are, so are your Idols Temples, and thy Idolatrous
Worship; the abomination of desolation, sitteth where it ought
not, and the Seed that belongeth to Immortal Life, is buried
in thee! O <hi>London, London!</hi> how art thou fallen? and from
whom art thou gone astray? even from the righteous Judge,
and pure God of heaven, and of earth, O! thou art dead, and
dying from the true worship and service of the Lord, which is
in Spirit &amp; in truth; thou art groaping at noon-day, and thy
light is not risen out of obscurity, that should give thee the
knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Jesus Christ,
although the measure of Gods grace hath called thee to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and doth strive with thee against thy pride, cruelty,
hard-heartedness, and oppression, but thou wilt not lend
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105066:3"/>
thine ear unto it, neither doth the grace of God teach thee;
but to the contrary art thou led unto persecution, by that
spirit which leadeth into transgression: O! how many of the
Lords dear servants, Lambs and Babes, hath the Lord sent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thy streets, high-wayes, and Idols Temples? to declare what
they have seen, tasted, and handled of the Word of Life, and
hath proclaimed this notable terrible day, which they see is
coming upon thee, &amp; to declare unto thee thy sins &amp; transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and how great the indignation of the glorious God will
be executed upon thee by reason of them, and for clearing
their consciences, and being obedient unto the Commands of
the Lord, some of them hast thou stoned, and some imprisoned,
and cruelly beat, and unmercifully used them, of which doings
the Lord taketh notice, and heareth the groans of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and the cries of the oppressed: O! its entered, its entered
into the ears of the Lord God of Sabbath, who knoweth how
great our sufferings is in this City, and in all quarters of the
whole earth, where we have been sent, we have groaned under
cruel oppression and tyranny, by unjust Judges, and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Rulers, especially by our own Countrymen, and in the
Land of our Nativity, for which my spirit is troubled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we all profess the name of Christians, and own Christ in
words, to be a Saviour, but in works and life you deny him;
and by this thing is the name of the Lord blasphemed amongst
all them, who doth not own Christ at all, whom you call Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens;
but truly their life condemns yours, they having no
Law, are a Law unto themselves, and they shall rise up in
Judgement with this Generation, <hi>who draweth nigh unto the
Lord with their lips, and their mouths, but their hearts is far from
God:</hi> O the Lord God will be eased of such a vain Religion as
this, he that seeth thee in secret is the munition of rocks, &amp; he
will reward thee openly, his Sickle shall pierce thy heart, and
his sword shall rip up thy bowels; pain, sorrow, and anguish
shall overtake thee, as a woman in travel, and from it thou
shalt not escape: O friends! as a woman hath pain before she
bringeth forth, so certainly and surely must you feel the
pangs of death, before you know the Birth immortal; and if
that this be not witnessed, there is no seeing of God, nor no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105066:3"/>
of his holy Hill, where alone dwelleth purity; holiness,
and righteousness for ever: O search and try, you who are
Citizens of this mortal City, which may truly be called <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
and <hi>Egypt,</hi> for in thee is the Son of God crucified, and
put to open shame! Do you feel or know a part in another Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which is immutable, which fadeth not away? Do you eat
of the hidden <hi>Manna</hi> which corrupteth not? or do you drink
of the Blood of the Lamb? Have you yet found peace
with the Lord? Are you reconciled unto the God of <hi>Jacob?</hi>
Are you saved, or saving from your sins? Or have you seen
the Lord, and the place where the mighty God dwelleth? if
not, your Religion is all in vain, and if you do not speedily
repent, you shall die in your sins, and where he is, you shall not
come; This will be his answer unto you, who is the <hi>Alpha</hi> and
<hi>Omega,</hi> the first and the last, <hi>Depart ye workers of iniquity, I
know you not:</hi> O this will be sad tidings unto you, who have
got a fair covering, but its not of the Spirit of God, which
the Lord will rent off in the day when he shall take peace from
the earth! O ye Inhabitants of this bloody City! cast away
every man from him the Idols of <hi>Egypt,</hi> with your gods of
gold and silver, of precious stones and goodly houses, and make
no longer your belly your gods, least God cut you off in this
day in which he is slaying the wicked with the First-born of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> the Lord will choak <hi>Pharoah,</hi> with all his Host, in the
Sea of confusion! O! a night of darkness is a coming upon
thee, and upon all thy neighbour Cityes, O! a thick cloud co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth
thee, mists and fogs is spread upon thee, thy glory is
staining, thy honor is laying in the dust, and thy mortal Crown
shall be thrown into the pit, thy destruction is coming upon
thee at noon-day; <hi>thou shalt look for light, but have none, and
for the dawning of the day, but it shall not appear; glad tidings
shall be hid from thee, sorrow, and trouble, and fear, shall compass
thee about; thou shalt wish for death rather then life, and for the
grave, but shall not find it, then shalt thou seek to thy Priests, thy
Rulers, and Judges, who have caused thee to erre, thinking thereby
to get peace, but shalt find none; the earth shall not bring forth
unto thee her encrease, as in times past;</hi> and as thy vultrous eye
hath been delighted with vanity, and thy adulterated ear hath
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105066:4"/>
been filled with curiosities of strange voices, and thy heart
hath been filled with lust, pride, and vanity, thy tongue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
with cursing, swearing, and lying, cheating and cozen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and taking the Name of the Lord in vain; and as thy feet
hath walked after pleasures, and thy hand hath handled de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulness,
guile, and fraud, and have been all servants unto
sin, and fulfilling the devils will, even so must the Vengeance
and Plagues of the Lord be powred out upon the Man of Sin,
which hath captivated thy mind, and misled thy members,
which was created only and alone to serve the living God,
the Creator of Heaven and Earth. O! what rioting, swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
cursing and drunkenness, murder, whoredome, and theft,
is found in thee, which grieveth the soul of the righteous, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zening,
and cheating, &amp; deceiving souls for dishonest gain, buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and selling the Words of God on the Market day, and in
the Idols Temple, all this is found in thee, which Words of
God, the holy men of God spoke them to the people freely; as
they had freely received; they coveted no mans gold, or silver,
but having food &amp; rayment, they were therewith content; and
they who preached freely, were Co-heirs with Christ, who had
purchased a City for them, whose Builder and Maker is God,
they said to the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> which sate in <hi>Moses</hi>
Chair, who had the Prophets words read amongst them, that
they would not enter in themselves, nor let others to enter in:
They said also, that they might all prophesie one by one, and
if any thing was revealed to one that stood by, he was to
speak, and the first was to hold his peace, for God is a God of
Order; but in this our day, which is the Lords, and the time
wherein we are cast, if any in the Spirit of the Lord come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
you, and be moved to speak in his power, thou beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
and bruisest, and hallest before thy Magistrates, and cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
into prisons, by this we see plainly and clearly, that thy
Religion is not the pure Religion, and that thy Church is the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and thou art governed by the Whores pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
which God is laying wast, and dashing to pieces, in this his
glorious day: Thy clouds of Religion, be they never so
thick, they are seen thorongh; in the light and power of God
we do measure the height, the length, depth, and breadth of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105066:4"/>
all thy Religion, thy Sun is eclipsed, and thy glory is fallen.
O thou <hi>Lucifer,</hi> Son of the Morning! thy portion is in the
lowermost hell, thy part and lot is vanished away, and thy
beauty is driven away, as the dust in the Summers day before
the wind; woe from the Lord God of Power be unto thy law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers,
for they have stollen away the key of knowledge: O the
oppressed groaneth under their cruel tyranny of oppression!
they lie in wait to ensnare the simple, and to beguile and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap
the honest-hearted; but the Lord loveth the pure in
heart, and preserveth them out of the Lions mouth, and out
of the paw of the Bear, glory be to God on high, Dominion
and strength be given to his Son for evermore: Howl ye Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers,
weep bitterly ye Rulers, and Judges, lament ye Priests,
for the day of Gods account is coming on, and it hasteneth,
wherein the Book of Conscience shall be opened, wherein
your sins are written, as with the point of a Diamond, and
out of the Book of Life you shall be judged, according as
your works shall be, so shall your reward be, for our God is
pure and immortal, he will torment the wicked, and plague
the ungodly, and cast into the pit for ever: O! I most humbly
beseech you, as in Christ stead, leave off your covetousness,
with your hypocritical Religion, your fained prayers, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
your selves in dust and ashes, that repentance and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Life you may know with the Lord, before thy house
of clay be dissolved, for the Son of Life weepeth over thee,
as he did over <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> O that thy eyes were open, and thy
heart unvailed, that thou mights see how good the Lord is unto
all the sons and daughters of men, and how long he hath ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
his mercy and grace unto thee, and hath held forth his
hand with a cup of blessings for thee, but thou hast joyned is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
with the transgressor, and art rebellions and stiff-necked
against the Seed of God, the Lord God make thee sensible of
thy back-slidings, and heal thee, if he see it good: O! my soul
is truly powred forth unto the Lord for thee, that thou may est
not inherit the Lake which is prepared, but peace and rest for
thy immortal soul thou mayest find; for the soul is immortal,
and there is no mortal thing can satisfie thy soul, but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the Lord, which is far beyond the gold of <hi>Ophir,</hi> or
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105066:5"/>
the <hi>Onick</hi> stone. O! what wouldst thou give for peace with God,
when thy day shall be turned into darness, &amp; thy table shall be
made a snare unto thee, and thou shalt be like the hearth in the
Wildernesse, which seeth not when good cometh, thy lovers
shall pass away, &amp; trouble shall compass thee round about; then
if thou hadst the whole world thou wouldst give it for peace
with God, but then will thy day be sealed up, and there
will be no place found for repentance; therefore I desire thee
in the dreadful power of God, put not the day of the Lord
afar off, but let the Sword of the Lord cut down, and the fire
burn up all that is contrary to God; and away with thy Idols,
down with thy Images, pluck down thy high places, for the
Lord will be avenged of thy Groves, thy strong Okes, and tall
Cedars, and he will ride upon thy high hills, and thy fenced
City will he lay waste; and he will ease the innocent, and
deliver the oppressed, thy prison doors shall be broke up, and
the bonds of iniquity burst asunder, the agreement made
with hell and death will be disannulled; and though many
of us have been halled out of your Mass-houses, and have been
halled before Magistrates, both by <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Protestants;</hi> yet
know this, that our God in whom we trust, he lives for ever,
and he sits as Judge amongst the Gods. O! the fury of the
Lord is gone forth against the wicked, and they shall not
prosper, and although they may reign for a while, and build
their nests in the stars for a short time, and joyn hand in hand
to punish the righteous, and to oppress the just, and to oppose
Christ and his Kingdome, yet he whose glorious reign is begun
in the earth, who is the King of Saints, and Governour of

the Circumcision which is made without hands, and a bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
into Christs death; and if a baptizing, then a death of
deaths unto all mortal, and visible, and dying things; then
wilt thou be a new creature, All old things will passe away, the

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105066:5"/>
Lamb dwelleth, whose Name is called the Word of God, who
is the light of the world, and was given of the Father a light
to lighten the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and to be the glory of his people <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
:This light checks thee in secret, when no mortal eye
seeth what thou art doing; this light beholds thee; and this
is Gods swift Witness, which he hath placed in man, which is
only and alone sufficient to lead into immortal life, although
the blind guides, who are of the cursed stock of <hi>Ham,</hi> sayes,
that this light which is in man, is natural, and not sufficient
of it self to lead to God. This is my testimony friends, which
I must bear amongst you, for the true light, against all that
doth oppose it, who hath been a Citizen with you in this
bloody City, and have been feeding with you upon the husks
with the Swine, and alienated from God, and a stranger to
his life, as you are at this day, whilest I was one with you
in your Religion and Worship, my soul was hungry, and was
even black with thirst, I had almost fallen in your streets for
want of the Bread of Life; no peace nor true rest amongst
you could I find, yet mornings, and evenings, and at noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
I sought the Lord, but could not find him, because I was
not in his way, neither did I hearken to his light, neither
could any of your chief Priests tell me where the Lord was to
be found, but told me in heaven, but what heaven was, and
where it was, they knew not; the light which is pure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
me, and no peace with the Lord could I find amongst
all your dead worships, and earthly performances; but at
length the Lord, <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ho is rich in mercy, he looked down from
his holy habitation, and he saw there was no help amongst
men, nor no refreshments to be received from their Ministry,
but my soul was dying and fainting away, with a numberless
number besides me, by reason of our sins &amp; transgressions, then
the Lord sent in fulness of time his Servants into this City,
<hi>F H</hi> and <hi>E B,</hi> who spoke the Word of Eternal Life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
my weary soul was refreshed, and the dead heard, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and glorifies the Lord in the land of the living: Glory
and honor be given to God, who sent them furnished with
the treasure of knowledge and wisdome, and to speak com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
unto the prisoner of hope; and I, amongst many in this
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105066:6"/>
City, may blesse the hour and the time that they came in the
Power and Spirit of God to visit this City, for by their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was I turned from darknesse to light, and from Satans
power to Gods; and they were instruments in the hand of the
Lord to bring me to his Kingdome, the Lord God in his end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
love hath made me forsake this City, with all the glory
and pleasures of it, and I see another City, and do inhabit a
more durable habitation, which will never fade away, but will
stand me in stead for ever; and by the light of Christ, which
is eternal, was I brought to this habitation; and if ever thou
comest to God, thou must own this light which thy Teachers
speak against: if thou wilt love the light, it will lead thee in
a path which thou hast not yet trodden in; there is no Lyon,
or Lyons Whelp, hath trodden in this path, no vultrous eye
hath seen it; therefore thou must come forth of thy fallen e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
thy whoredomes and ungodlinesse, before one step thou
canst tread in; therefore repent, and come and drink freely
of our Fountain, and eat of our Rock, who liveth for ever:
O! my hearts desire unto the Lord is, that you may be saved
from your sin, and purged from your iniquities, and be made
clean by the blood of the Lamb, before you return to the
dust from whence you came, and shall be seen no more: For
friends, there must be a laying down of the earthly, and as
that is laid down, there is a receiving of the heavenly; but
if you live in sin, and die in sin, then is there no redemption
from sin, sin separates from God; <hi>the wa<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">

<hi>For there is no repentance in the grave, nor no remissinn of sin af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
death, but as the tree falleth, so it lieth, as Death leaveth
you, Judgement will find you; and as the lightening shineth in
the East unto the West, so is the coming of the Son of man in his
day upon all sinners:</hi> He will come as a thief in the night upon
thee, then what secret corner hast thou to hide thee in? or
what remote place canst thou fly unto for shelter? seeing our
God is potent over Sea and Land, and his eye is over the
whole world, and his hand is stretched over all living. O!
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105066:6"/>
the Rocks and the Mountains shall not cover thee, nor dens,
nor holes, nor caves of the earth shall not shelter thee, but the
Lord will be avenged of thee, and plead with thee himself,
who is a just God, and a Saviour, and will give unto every
man according as his works shall be, from whose presence the
wicked must depart. O! blessed and happy for ever are all
they who knows a redeeming from amongst men, and from a
vain and a light conversation, by the precious blood of the
Lamb. O! give thanks to God fro ever, that he hath, and is
giving you a possession in the durable inheritance, that never
fadeth away; you are built upon the Rock of Ages, never to
be removed. O! let us dwell together in the unity of the
Spirit, and in the bond of love for ever, that we may stand
for ever witnesses against this wicked and perverse Generation,
who have not the fear of God before their eyes, whom God
will destroy as he did the old world, and they shall be as ashes
under the soals of the righteous feet. O <hi>London!</hi> in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the Lord God I declare unto thee, thy peace is not
durable, neither will thy Faith remain, it is as the raging Sea,
whose waves are up and down, and thou art tossed in thy
mind, as a Ship upon the Sea, driven with a mighty wind;
thy hope is in man, and it faileth; thy joy is dying, and will
die away. O! therefore put thy trust in the living God, and
not in man, whose breath is in his nostrils, that thou mayest
be saved from the day of wrath, which will suddenly come
upon the families of the earth: All Nations shall partake of
his wrath, and all Tongues of his fury; for all flesh hath cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
its way before the Lord, all flesh hath sinned, and come
short of the glory of God, so all flesh must know the wrath of
God executed upon the wicked, for the Lord hath determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
a Consumption to come upon the whole earth; therefore
O earth, earth! hear the Word of the Lord, and be thou se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from your uncleanness, and live before the Lord, <hi>that
all the dayes of thy appointed time, thou mayest wait till the

who is immortal. And know this of a truth, that this is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

of oppression: O! feed the hungry, and cloath the naked,
and hide not thy self from thy own flesh, for you are all
made of one blood, and one mould, upon the face of the
whole earth: He that saith he loves God, and doth not feed
the hungry, and cloath the naked, and judge the cause of the
poor and needy, he is a lyar, and doth not the truth. And
know this ye Judges, and Rulers, and Magistrates, that there
is a Judge above you which will call you to an account, and
will judge you out of the book of Conscience, and give you
a full reward; and you shall all know in the day when the
Lord rips off all coverings, and takes peace from the earth,
that there is a Deliverer in <hi>Sion,</hi> which will deliver his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous

            <p>Oh <hi>London!</hi> the Lord God of Heaven and of Earth, he is
burdened with thy vain Religion; who maketh a profession of
God, and of Christ, and yet liveth in lust and vanity, pride
and vain-glory, in swearing and curfing, and yet is covered
with a covering which the Lord will take away: O how doth

gluttony abound in thee, rioting and sporting in the day

art so proud and haughty, and the poor in thee are ready to
famish, for whose estate and condition my heart is pained
within me, old and young, blind and lame, lieth in thy
streets, and at thy Masse-houses doors crying for bread, who
are almost naked for want of cloathing, and fainting for
want of bread, and yet thou canst passe by them in thy gaudy
apparrel; and our-stretched neck, with thy face decked with
black spots, which are the marks of the Whore, the Beast, and
the False Prophet, which is not the attire of <hi>Sarah, Abrahams</hi>
wife: Thou knowest not what to eat, nor what to drink, nor
wherewith to be cloathed, thy mind is so vain, and thy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is so aiery; and if any of these that are blind, or lame,
or destitute of a being, asketh of thee a penny, or farthing,
thou sayest thou hast it not for them. O! remember the Lord
will call thee to an account; and truly a sad day it will be
for thee, when he shall take thy peace away; who hath lavishly
spent Gods Creation upon thy lusts, and hath not distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
thy morsel to the poor, and to the needy, the light of
Christ in thy Conscience condemns thee for thy not so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and from that thou canst not fly, that shall be thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation

doth inhabit this mortal City which doth-corrupt, and will

and in him are the families of the earth blessed, who doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

are ye blessed of the most high God? Art thou halled out of

thou mayest certainly know that thy journey is holy, and thy
path is pure wherein thou treadest, where thy persecutors can
by no means walk in, but they must own thee and thy
life, which will slay the first nature, birth, and glory, and
bring into the fools estate, that ye may truly be made wise,
and endued with the treasure of wisdome, which liveth and

the Lord, whose Name is, <hi>I am,</hi> and there is none like him

hath fallen man received a measure from the beautiful God
to bring him out of sin, and transgression, and to redeem
him wholly from the fallen estate, it is placed in man only
and alone to redeem him from death to life, and to be his
salvation, and satisfaction, or condemnation for ever; and
this is my witness in every man, and to this do I speak, and it
shall arise and answer for me in the day of the Lord; and this
is the seed that the Lord hath left in the earth, in which seed
the families of the earth is blessed, and in the seeds light
shall all the Nations that are saved walk in, and triumph in
his name, which is called the Word of God, by which the
world was made, and the heavens was framed, who was in his
Fathers bosome before man was, or had a being upon the
earth, and shall live and abide for ever, glory and thanks be
given unto the Lord, whose Royal Standard is set up in the
earth, and whose Reign is begun upon the earth, and whose
Tabernacle is with men, whose dwelling and abiding is with
the sons and daughters of men: Glory over all Sea and Land

and who is he that doth condemn, or lay any thing to the
charge of Gods Elect? It is the Lamb of God that taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all sin, and in him is no sin, and if he condemneth, who
can justifie? Therefore let all that are justified, and set free by
the Lamb, abide in their freedome, and live in the power and
life of the Birth Immortal, that they may not be intangled
again with the yoke of bondage, which is truly a yoke indeed,
and heavier to be borne then it was at the first: for there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth

but you shall sit as a Widdow, that is, rebuked of husband
and children, bemoaning her self; even so shall you be: But
if you are willing to endure this straight way, and narrow
gate, wherein nothing that is of this world shall enter, but
must be laid down; and if you will deny your selves, and
take up your daily crosse, and follow the light, whom you
have grieved and wounded with your whoredomes and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
whithersoever he goeth, then shall you be with us, where we
are, and eat and drink with us of the living Bread and Water
of Life, and see him who is invisible, who cannot be seen
but by Faith, and this Faith purifies the heart, <hi>and maketh
pure, as God is pure.</hi> O! Come unto the Fountain of Life,
and drink freely with us: O! Christ hath invited all upon
the whole face of the earth, poor and rich, to come into his
banqueting house, and to eat freely of the Bread of Life, and
to drink of the still waters of <hi>Shilo,</hi> which satisfieth the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
soul. O! come to our Shepherd, who hath laid down
his life for his sheep: O come! and see how good he is, and
where he feedeth his flock at noon-day; O! come into his
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105066:11"/>
Fold, who is all love, and life, and gaineth unto God the hungry soul,
and reconcileth every tyred spirit which panteth after him, and blessed
are all they who feeleth satisfaction with the Lord, it is better then wine
or oyl; and all who joyneth issue with the Seed of God, they know a
more durable encrease, for they encrease in wisdome, purity, and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and so dwelleth with the Lord in their measures. O! all ye that
have followed Christ, the Heir of Life and Salvation, and doth follow him
in the straight way, and narrow gate, your portion is eternal, if you
dwell therein, and look not out at the over-turnings of men, and their
power, and what they may inflict upon you, or cause you to suffer hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
for your Religion, which you profess in truth and righteousness, but
look to the Lord, who hath the hea<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ts of all the Sons and Daughters of
<hi>Adam</hi> in his hand, and as a river of water he can turn them whither so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he will: therefore my dear beloved friends, who are friends of God,
let us dwell together in the life immortal, and let us be compassed about
with Gods righteousness and strength for ever, that if the Lord suffereth
that we should suffer death for our Religion which is pure, let us choose it
rather then life, and joyfully, and heartily, and patiently imbrace it, and
bear it, for our God is good, and in the midst of flames (he hath) and will
be with us, and from the waters he will deliver us; in the sixth trouble
he hath been with us, and from the seventh he hath delivered us, glory
be to him who is as a wall of brass round about us, and as a flame of fire
he compasseth us about; he was with the Patriarchs in the deepest of
their calamities; the Prophets in times past he upheld, and was their
meat and drink, and in him they rejoyced, and with him they suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and finished their testimony in faithfulness; he was unto the <hi>Disciples,</hi>
a stay, and a staff, salvation and righteousness, even their exceeding great
reward; their houses was filled with his life and power, he was a
mouth of utterance unto them, he carried them thorough great tryals,
he was their meat and drink, and they fed upon him in a weary Land,
even so can we truly say, that he hath been with us in a vast howling wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,
in a strange Land, and amongst strange people, who have not
truly worshipped the God of heaven and earth, he hath been our stay
and the upholder of our head in the day of battel: Glory be to him
who is our Rock, who never leaved nor forsaked any that fears him,
but he watereth them with the dew from heaven, and maketh them
green as the grass, or tender plants; he cloatheth them far beyond the
Lillies in the field, he giveth breath, and life, and length of dayes for
ever in his sight; therefore all who have known this cloathing, let it
dwell with you for ever, and let your hearts be upright in his sight, your
consciences exercised continually in the sight of God and men; and the
Lord God of heaven and of earth preserve us all in all, and over all, and
thorough all, up to himself: <hi>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is
perfect, and the peace which standeth for ever, keep your hearts and minds staid
upon him for ever, out of all mortal and dying things.</hi>

came, and whether it went, and to whom it was offered; And I
could have wept day and night to have seen the path of Righteousness
trodden down, and all trampling upon the Seed of God, which lyeth

day and night, and it shall rise up in Judgement against you, that
day and night shall you remember with all the rest of your time ill

men, whose zeal did far exceed thine in this thy day; and this is it, that thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
