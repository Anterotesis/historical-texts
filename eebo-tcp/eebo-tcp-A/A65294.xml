            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Self-denial is learned not out of the <hi>Topicks</hi> of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, but the <hi>Oracles</hi> of Scripture. It is my request to the Reader, to peruse this Manual with seriousness, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Practice</hi> of Self-denial is that wherein his salvation is nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.

               <p>
                  <hi>ALL Scripture is given by inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16. The Word is compared to a <hi>Lamp,</hi> for its illuminating quality, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:38624:4"/>
105. And to <hi>Silver refined,</hi> for its enriching quality, <hi>Psal.</hi> 12.6. Among other parts of Sacred Writ, this is not the least, <hi>If any man will come after me, let him deny himself.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These words are dropped from the lips of Christ, the <hi>ORACLE</hi> of <hi>TRVTH.</hi> In the precedent verse, our Blessed Saviour did foretel his Passion, <hi>The Son of man must suffer many things.</hi> And his suffering is set down in two expressions:</p>
               <p n="1">1. He must be <hi>rejected</hi>; Thus he was <hi>The stone which the builders refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,</hi> Psal. 118.22.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He must be <hi>slain.</hi> This Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond must be cut. He who gave life to others, must himself dye <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Fusus est sanguis medici, &amp; sactum est medicamen phrenetici:</hi> Aug.</note>. And as Christ did thus <hi>abase</hi> himself for us, so we must <hi>deny</hi> our selves for him; <hi>And he said to them all, if any man will come after me, let him deny himself.</hi> Self-denial is the foundation of Godliness, and if this be not well laid, all the building will fall. Let me explain the words.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:38624:4"/>1. <hi>And he said to them all</hi>] Self-denial is of <hi>Vniversal extent,</hi> it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns all, it respects both Ministers and People. Christ spake it as well to his <hi>Apostles,</hi> as the rest of his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If any man will come after me</hi>] If he will follow me as the Soldier doth his <hi>General:</hi> if he will arrive at that place of Glory whither I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Let him deny himself.</hi>] <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Erasmus</hi> render it, let him <hi>lay aside,</hi> or <hi>reject</hi> himself <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Abdicet seipsum.</hi>
                  </note>. Self-denial is a kind of Self-annihilation. The words have two parts:

               <p>O let us deny, yea, abhor this vain-glorious humour. We have a

famous example in <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> who sought to lift up Christ, and beat down himself. John 1.15, <hi>He that cometh after me is preferred before me.</hi> As if he had said, I am but the <hi>Herald, The voice of one crying</hi>

So when any eminent service in Church or State hath been done, the glory of all should be given to Christ and free grace. It is better God should approve, than the World applaud. If we are faithful, we shall have honour enough in Heaven. Let this be our chief aim in duty, that we may grow more in love with God, and be made more like him, and have more communion with him, and bring

more revenues of honour to him. 1 Pet. 4.11, <hi>That in all things, God may be glorified.</hi> We should not only <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,</hi> but <hi>design</hi> Gods glory.

Without self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, we can never come up to Christs terms. If the World be not denied, Christ cannot be loved. If self-righteousness be not denied, Christ cannot be trusted; if the will be not denied, Christ cannot be obeyed: Therefore self-denial, is of as abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute necessity as Heaven.</p>

Luke 18.8, <hi>When the son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?</hi> May it not be said, <hi>Shall he find Self-denial on the earth?</hi> Self-denial is gone a long Pilgrimage, and who can tell when it will return?</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. Containing a swasive to Self-denial.</head>
               <p>MY next work is to perswade Christians to the <hi>Practice</hi> of this momentous duty of Self-denial. Man lost himself at first by self-exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and he must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover himself by self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p n="1">1. Self-denial is just and equal. How much hath Christ denied himself for us? He eclipsed his Glory; Phil. 2.7. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>He emptied himself.</hi> What wonderful self-denial was it, for Christ to leave his Fathers bosom and be incarnate? For Christ to be made flesh, was more than for all the Angels to be made worms. Christ denied his name and repute; Heb. 12.2, <hi>He endured the shame.</hi> He denied worldly grandure and riches; 1 Cor. 8, 9. <hi>For our sakes he became poor.</hi> The
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:38624:30"/>
Manger was his Cradle, the Cobwebs his Curtains. He denied his Life, Phil. 2, 8, <hi>He became obedient to death.</hi> 'Tis but equity we should deny our selves for Christ.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Self-denial is the sign of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Christian. Hypocrites may have great knowledg, and make fair pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, but it is only the sincere Saint can deny himself, and lay his life at Christs feet. This was a touchstone of <hi>Moses</hi> sincerity, he denied the pleasures of the Court, and chose af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction rather than iniquity, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25. I have read of an holy Man who was once tempted by Satan, to whom Satan said, why takest thou all this pains, what dost thou more than I? Art thou no Drunkard, no Adulterer? no more am I; dost thou watch? I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver sleep; dost thou fast? I never eat; What dost thou more than I? Why, said the good Man, I tell thee Satan, I give my self to Prayer; nay more, I deny my self: Nay, then saith the Devil, thou goest beyond me, for I exalt my self; and so vanished.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:38624:30"/>3. Self-denial is a <hi>rational</hi> thing. For, if <hi>self</hi> be an <hi>enemy,</hi> then it is wisdom to discard it. There is a <hi>rationality</hi> in all Gods commands. Why would he have us deny <hi>fleshly lusts,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>They war against our souls?</hi> 1 Pet. 2.11. Why would he have us deny Pride, but because of its noxious qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity? Prov. 16.18, <hi>Pride goeth before destruction.</hi> Where Pride leads the Van, Destruction brings up the Rear. God would have us deny nothing for him, but that which will damn us if we keep.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is nothing lost by self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial. We shall be abundantly compensated. Mat. 19.29, <hi>Every one that hath forsaken houses, and lands for my sake, shall receive an hundred-fold, and shall inherit life everlasting.</hi> If we deny our name and repute for Christ, God will give us inward peace, there is <hi>an hundred-fold</hi> in this life; and will honour us before the Angels; how many hundred-folds that amounts to, I am not able to tell.

To <hi>a bright morning-star</hi> for beauty, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.16. Jesus Christ is all that God can require
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:38624:31"/>
for satisfaction, or we can desire for Salvation. He is fully commensurate to our wants. He hath <hi>eye-salve</hi> to anoint us, <hi>White rayment</hi> to cover us <note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 3.18.</note>, the balm of his Blood to heal us.</p>
               <p>We shall never deny our selves for Christ, till we see a glory and a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in him. Christ is all marrow and sweetness, he is better than life, estate, Heaven.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Endeavour after a <hi>Vital principle</hi> of Grace. Grace will do that which <hi>flesh and blood</hi> cannot. A Man may do that by art, which he cannot do by strength. A burden of great weight, may be lift up by screws and pullies, which cannot be lift up by strength of arm. Grace will teach one the art of Self-denial, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done by strength of Nature. In particular, labour for three Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Humility.</hi> A proud Man admires himself, therefore cannot deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. An humble Man lays his mouth in the dust, he hath lower thoughts of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:38624:32"/>
himself than others can have of him, he goes out of himself, he renounceth himself, he opens to God, as the Flower to the Sun. He will do what God will have him do, he will be what God will have him be, he is like melting Wax, God may set what stamp and impression he will upon him. The humble Man is the self-denier.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Love.</hi> Who will not deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for a Friend whom he loves? He will part with any thing he hath, he will gratifie him he loves, though it be to his own loss. He whose heart is fired with love to Christ, will stick at nothing for his sake. <hi>Gregory Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen</hi> said of his <hi>Athenian</hi> Learning, he was glad he had any thing of worth, to esteem as nothing for Christ.
