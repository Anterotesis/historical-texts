            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Some Thoughts concerning the Affairs of this Seſſion of <hi>Parliament, 1700.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>OF all Governments <hi>Monarchy</hi> is the beſt, and leaſt ſubject to Inconveniences; but becauſe the Monarch is a man ſubject to Errors in Judgment, and capable of being by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſed in his Affections, it was therefore neceſſary, that the Common-Wealth, as it gave him great Power over them, ſo it ſhould aſſigne him alſo the beſt Helps, for directing both his Will and Judgement.</p>
            <p>The firſt Help was <hi>Law,</hi> which is the Rule both to King and People.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, were certain Councills and Counſellors with whom to conſult in matters of moſt Importance, as we ſee in the <hi>Dyets</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> the <hi>Courts</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:38289:3"/>
of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> without which no matters of moment can be concluded. The <hi>Romans</hi> had their <hi>Senat,</hi> and the <hi>Graecians</hi> their <hi>Ephori.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As We are happy in a Limited <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical</hi> Government, ſo it has ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed well with our Kings when they have had VViſe Counſellours, and have been adviſed by their <hi>Parliaments</hi> in things relating to the Publick Good.</p>
            <p>The Nature of our <hi>Parliament</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained in the 8. <hi>Par. K. Ja.</hi> 6. <hi>Act</hi> 2. where it's ſaid; That by the court of <hi>Parliament</hi> under GOD, the Kingdom hath been upholden; Rebellion, and Traiterous Subjects puniſhed; the Good and Faithfull Preſerved, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and the Laws and Acts of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (by which all good men are Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned) are made and eſtabliſhed, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This Act was made whilſt our King was yet amongſt Our ſelves, but no ſooner did We looſe Him, than We dwindled all of a ſudden into old Age:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:38289:3"/>
and altho' the whole Iſland has been Chriſtened by the Name of <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> only have reaped the Honour and Advantage of this Union.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> VII. of <hi>England</hi> ſaid to one of his Counſellours, that the Marriage between his Daughter, and Our King, would make <hi>Scotland</hi> an Acceſſion to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> ſome VVay or other: nor could it be otherways, when our Kings, ever ſince the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, have lived in <hi>England,</hi> and that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being made ſecret to our near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Concerns have had the Art to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence Our Counſells for their own Intereſt.</p>
            <p>Kingdoms are United either when they become the ſame People in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection: (ſuch is our Union with <hi>England)</hi> or when they are United in Laws and Intereſt; ſo that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſame Common-Wealth: one Head Rules them, and all inferiour Members conſpire for the Proſperity of the whole Body.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:38289:4"/>
The laſt of theſe Unions is Good for both: Whereas the firſt is neither laſting, nor can all Parties be juſtly dealt with by the ſame Maſter. We Knovv <hi>Portugall</hi> ſoon Revolted from <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If We are Stated, That, as the Poorer Part of this Iſland, VVe are to Enjoy nothing that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> may think of ill Conſequence to them; The Queſtion is, <hi>Whether We ſhould prefer their Interest or our own?</hi> And ſurely, a juſt King who is Father of both coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, muſt be put to it, by Deliberate Reflections upon the Oaths He has taken to both Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Secretaries</hi> who have been oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to attend at Court, were the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons by whom the Advice of the Privy Council concerning the Affairs of this Nation, has been communicated to our Kings, and by whom their Majeſties have ſignified their Will to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; But it may be doubted whether the Advice, followed by thoſe Kings,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:38289:4"/>
has been that of <hi>England,</hi> that of the <hi>Secretaries,</hi> or that of the <hi>Council</hi> here</p>
            <p>By the great Truſt Our <hi>Secretaries</hi> have, they ought to be Guardians to their Country; that by their Vigilant Care and Probity, Subjects may find experimentally, that they are as much for their Advantage, as they have Power and Dignitie.</p>
            <p>No privat Advantage, no Self-Ends ſhould move them to Betray their Charge; No <hi>Engliſh</hi> Dependence ſhould Dare them; but by their Virtue they ſhould raiſe their Character above the Envy of wicked men.</p>
            <p>They ſhould mind what <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſays; that tho' the Deliberations of all other men do commonly conſiſt in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations of Utility, and Profit, yet the ſtate of a Prince is ſuch that He ought principalie to reſpect Fame and Reputation.</p>
            <p>It ſhould be a great Awe upon them to be Honeſt; that Favorites of Princes
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:38289:5"/>
have been ſo often Sacrificed to an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſayeth that the Counſellors of <hi>Dionyſius, Phalaris,</hi> and <hi>Apollodorus,</hi> were juſtlie Tormented by the People; becauſe he who Seduceth a Prince de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth no leſs to be abhor'd of all men, than one that ſhould Poyſon a publick Fountain, whereof all men ſhould Drink.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. in the Beginning of his Reign, to ſatisfie his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects who Importuned Him for Juſtice againſt <hi>Emſon</hi> and <hi>Dudly</hi> for the evill Council they had given to <hi>Henry</hi> VII. in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Exactions and Impoſitions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered them to be Puniſhed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Law.</p>
            <p>VVe might be liable to ſuffer, if we had no other to informe His Majeſty, about our Eaſe and Riches, than <hi>Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries</hi> and <hi>Courtiers,</hi> from whom muſt depend the Character of every one in Publick Truſt here.</p>
            <p>It's our <hi>Parliaments</hi> therefore that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:38289:5"/>
have taken Notice of our Concerns<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it is to this <hi>Parliament</hi> we have Recourſe for our preſent Affairs; ſeeing His Majeſtie is for the preſent ſo occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied in Managing the Intereſts of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> that He leaves ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely to our Honourable Members of <hi>Parliament,</hi> not only to call miſsinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers to an Account, but to inform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in every thing concerns our Good.</p>
            <p>We would have been very happy to have had the Preſence of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty in this <hi>Seſſion</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to His Royal Promiſe, which has been allways neceſſary for us: That He might be informed at one View, what is fit to be done in every Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Affairs, that He might know what part of His Kingdom Flouriſhes, and what part of it Languiſhes: That He who is above all in Honour and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, would be likeways Intereſſed for the Benefit of the Publick, and that He might have Occaſion to influence His People to their Duty, by His Piery
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:38289:6"/>
Juſtice, Valour, Clemency, and other Princely Qualities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Noble was that Speech of</hi> Henry <hi>IV. of</hi> France, <hi>and worthy of ſo good a King, when he Aſſembled the States of his Kingdom at</hi> Rouen <hi>1596. which he ends thus.</hi> I have not called you to this Place, as my predeceſſors have done, to oblige you blindly to approve of my Will; I have Summoned you to Receive, to Believe, and to Follow Your Councils: In a Word, to make You my Guardians.</p>
            <p>How acceptable would ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe be to this preſent <hi>Parliament,</hi> from His Majeſty? and what might we hope, but to be watched over; our Good, our Eaſe, and Wellfare, to be the End of His Undertakings, and the Happineſs, Strength, Wealth, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of our Country to be His Joy and Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>But it's You, moſt Honourable Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, He makes at preſent Judges of every thing is for the Benefit of this
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:38289:6"/>
Nation, and in whoſe hands He De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitates His Royal Care of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>And ſurely His Majeſty, who has been our Deliverer, will Abominat that Baſe and Diſhonourable Method Publick Miniſters had of Corrupting our Members of <hi>Parliament,</hi> by Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Money, or Promiſes, to Betray the Intereſt of this Nation.</p>
            <p>Every one knows the Plot was firſt Hatched at Court, of making or abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating ſuch and ſuch Laws: ſome Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourit read the Liſt of our Members of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and as they found a Name for their purpoſe, they Marked it with a Capital Letter.</p>
            <p>If the Names marked did not exceed the Remainder of the Liſt, ſo much Money was order'd to increaſe the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: and this was recommended to the <hi>Management</hi> of the <hi>Commiſſioner,</hi> and <hi>Secretaries,</hi> who ſo ſoon as they Arriv'd in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſet all Hands to Work for the Imploying it to good purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:38289:7"/>
May all our preſent Members of <hi>Parliament</hi> Deteſt thoſe Ancient Vices, and Remember, rhat our King knows the Reward belongs to Merit; knows the Dutie of a good Patriot, and the Treacherie of one betrays His Country; Let them all then lay to Heart the good of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>A Nobleman, as a Nobleman, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to Imploy his Powerful Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to the Publick, to Maintain it with his Wealth, his Riches, and his Blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He ought to be the Supporter and Pillar of his Country, a Defence to the Poor and oppreſſed, and a Check to the Violence of wicked Men. Theſe were the Qualities have made the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors of ſome of our Nobility ſo Famous in Hiſtorie, and their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie ſo dear to Poſteritie.</p>
            <p>A Gentleman who's a Member of <hi>Parliament,</hi> is to be Faithfull to his Truſt, both out of Principles of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Intereſt; for if We take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Honeſtie from him, He will dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:38289:7"/>
nothing from the Refuſe of Society; or by what other diſtinguiſhing Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter can we know him from the Mob? If He betray the Liberties of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, how can He hope to tranſmit his Eſtate to his Heirs, or Secure his Friends from Slaverie and Oppreſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>And all Members of <hi>Parliament</hi> are to remember, that as they are the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentativ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> of this Nation, ſo they are the Protectors of its Priviledges; who ought to Examine the Intereſt of the People, contribute to their Wealth and Security, be Mediators between them and His Majeſty, endeavour to Remove ill Counſellours from Him; And they ought to act in every part, as Men of Probity: Being bound to Diſcharge their Truſt, both by Duty and Oath.</p>

if He came, not to interpoſe his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in a Debate which was to be moved there; Sent back Word, that his Character of a Senator required his Attendance, nor would he baulk any Thing that became him according to Conſcience and Duty. <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked with what He thought inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in this Reply, Threatned to put Him to Death. To which ſecond Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage He returned thus: <hi>Did I ever tell the Emperour that I was immortal? His Majeſty, I ſuppoſe, will do His</hi> Pleaſure and I will do my Duty; it is in his Power to put Me to Death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly, but it is in my Power to Die Virtuouſly.</p>
            <p>The preferring the Good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth to any ſelf-Intereſt, is the greateſt Ornament of the Soul; and when all our Actions are meaſured in Reſpect of their Objects, moſt Noble are theſe which Aim moſt at the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good; By which Virtue the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> Heroes became the Peoples <hi>Gods;</hi>

            <p>Altho' the Law of this Kingdom hath attained to a great Perfection by its few and clear Statutes, nevertheleſs
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:38289:9"/>
as the Affairs of the World, and our own Circumſtances Change, we muſt have <hi>Parliaments</hi> to Provide us with new Laws. I doubt not but our <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> will take into their Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our Trade, our Publick Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's, our ſtanding Armie, and our Publick Treaſurie. Upon which ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſhall make theſe following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Trade is neceſſary to any Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that either will have Riches, or their Poor Imployed; and this is a Truth ſo well known, and all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons perſwaded of it, that the Thoughts of moſt men are turned that way.</p>
            <p>It will be happy for us, that it be Carefully looked after; eſpecially the Affairs of our Company Trading to <hi>America,</hi> and the Colony they have planted in <hi>Darian,</hi> in Spite, both of forreign and domeſtick Enemies; our juſt Title to which, of late, has been proved by unanſwerable Arguments; So that it's the Nations Honour for Our
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:38289:9"/>
               <hi>Parliament</hi> both to aſſiſt our Directors with Money, and Authority to retrive their Loſſes; and to Frown upon all their Enemies; as being no Friends to this Country.</p>
            <p>I'm perſwaded no Tax will be more agreeable to the Subject, nor more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilie payed, than for carrying on this Project, that has made the name of our Nation Reign in all Forraigne Courts, after it has been in Oblivion for almoſt this Century; and which has made us Formidable to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whoſe Grand-Fathers thought that <hi>Scotland</hi> was a Province of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Profit that may ariſe to Us from our <hi>Colony,</hi> if it proſper, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to everie one knows the Riches of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Plantations; And let us but Suppoſe, that we are only able to Keep in our Poſſeſſion, the Port of SAINT <hi>ANDREW</hi> in <hi>CALE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DONIA,</hi> it may ſerve to be a Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zin for all our Commodities in the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> and to Manage a private
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:38289:10"/>
Trade with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> to the great Advantage of this Nation.</p>
            <p>But let Us have a more Noble End than Gain alone; The Propagation of the <hi>CHRISTIAN RELIGION;</hi> and if this were the only Motive, We ought to part with our Money freely for the Glory of GOD.</p>
            <p>To Oppoſe our Deſigns we have but one declared Enemy, the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> who if He endeavour to drive us from our Poſſeſſion, Honour obliges Us to Defend our ſelves.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Dutch</hi> oppreſs Us, contrary to the Laws of Nations, I don't ſee what ſhould hinder Us to take Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection wherever it may be found.</p>
            <p>It may be ſome People will object, that our <hi>Darian</hi> Buſineſs will occaſion a War with <hi>Spain;</hi> or, that our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors have miſ-managed.</p>
            <p>But in ſuch Objections there's more Humour, than Love for the Country;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:38289:10"/>
becauſe by the ſame Argument we may be Bullied out of any thing the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, Dutch,</hi> or any other Nation has a Likeing to; and even be Obliged at laſt, by another Step of Complaiſance, to renounce the Title of a free Kingdom.</p>
            <p>If our Directors have failed either by Ignorance or Negligence in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, that ſhould not keep Us from doing our Duty, nor to contribute all that's in our Power, for Recovering the Loſſes of our Companie; otherways all advantageous Projects may be balk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe ther's allways Knaves Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued in them.</p>
            <p>If any Body has the Impudence to amuſe us with Fiſheries and other uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Projects, it ſhould be looked on as <hi>Banter;</hi> For when His Majeſtie has diſcountenanced us to gratifie the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> or rather the <hi>Dutch,</hi> we don't Know what more he will doe for his Native country.</p>
            <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> Society is a great Support to Trade, for great Interpriſes can be better
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:38289:11"/>
carryed on by the Credit of many, than by one ſingle Family or Perſon; and it has been the Practice of our Neighbouring Countries to Eſtabliſh Companies, Trading to different places of the World; and ſeverall Societies at Home to mind their Manufactories, and have protected them with particu-Laws and Immunities.</p>
            <p>It's by Honeſty and fair Dealing that all Societies flouriſh; and vvell did the <hi>Romans</hi> Know that, when they pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the Members of Societies for Frauds and ſupine Negligence, with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>ff. de his qui not. infa.</hi> § <hi>poen. Inſt. de poen. tem. litig.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Nature of Man is ſo prone to Wickedneſs, and ſo eaſily led away by Temptation, that if there be not ſome ſevere means taken to prevent all ill Practices: Ther's no Society but may be ruined, being expoſed to the catch of everie miſerable <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arper,</hi> and ſpecially here where ſome Merchants know bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter how to impoſe upon people that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:38289:11"/>
deal with them, than to preſerve that Candor which becomes every honeſt Trader.</p>
            <p>Therefore it's adviſable that it ſhould be made Death and Forfeiture to every one who is found Defrauding the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of which he is member; and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for all other delinquences Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably to their Nature. The one half of the Forfeiture ſhould be added to the ſtock of the Companie, and the other half given to Him who Accuſes the ſaid Member; by ſuch Laws ill men will be keep'd in their duty and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men will not eaſily be Impoſed on.</p>
            <p>3<hi>ly.</hi> Every well Governed Nation muſt be in a Poſture to Defend her ſelf, and upon good ground to aſſiſt her Allyes abroad.</p>
            <p>Had we therefore either fear to be attaked by our Enemies; or Allyes to aſſiſt; we ſhould have all the reaſon ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable to keep a ſtanding Armie: and I believe no Subject would repine
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:38289:12"/>
to be Taxed for It's Subſiſtence Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably to his Abilities.</p>
            <p>Why ſhould we be affraid for Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies abroad, when <hi>England</hi> which is the better part of this Iſland thought it ſelf ſecure immediatly after the Peace? and Kept no more Force than to Secure the Peace at Home, and prevent all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances.</p>
            <p>What Allyes have We to aſſiſt? un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs We are ſo officious as to call thoſe of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> our Allyes; like the Highland Countrey-man who call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all his Maſter,s Couſins his own.</p>
            <p>At the Treatie of <hi>Ryſewyck,</hi> was ever the name of our Nation mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any more than as one of his Majeſties Titles? did ever any bodie endeavour to Recover our old priviledges from <hi>France?</hi> or what have we Reaped, for all that our Country men ſhewed either in Valour or Adreſs, for Obtaining an Honourable Peace?</p>
            <p>We are neglected by all the World, when they don't ſtand in need of us;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:38289:12"/>
Contempt is our only Reward for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring Warr againſt <hi>France,</hi> when we had not a Ship to defend our little Trai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e; And our Souldiers are ſent home Poor and Mutilated, to eat our Bread, till ſuch time the <hi>Dutch</hi> or <hi>Engliſh</hi> find ſervice for them.</p>
            <p>Is it not time to look to our ſelves when everie other Nation minds their particular Intereſt; and either at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to declare our ſelves mercenary Fools, or to act as a wiſe &amp; Free Nation?</p>
            <p>Let our <hi>Parliament</hi> remember that Mercy is to be uſed to the Purſe of the Subject; Or, how dangerous ſtanding Armies have proved to <hi>France, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark Poland,</hi> and other Countries; nor do we Know what Influence our Forces might have upon Us at preſent, were they ill inclined.</p>
            <p>Let our Honourable Members con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Poverty of our Country, the Decay of Trade, and the great Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure our <hi>Courtiers</hi> and <hi>Penſioners</hi> carry every Year from this to <hi>England.</hi> So
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:38289:13"/>
accordingly may they inform their Judgements about the Neceſſitie of a ſtanding Armie.</p>
            <p>Alltho' it's abſolutelie neceſſarie to Disband the moſt of Our Troops; yet Juſtice and Intereſt require, that all the well-deſerving Officers ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with Penſions, to keep them in this Countrie, that they may be in a Readineſs to Serve when the common Defence requires.</p>
            <p>Wiſe Men know that in Time of Neceſſitie good Officers are ill to be got; and the <hi>Confoederats,</hi> in the beginning of the laſt War, found that all the Advantages the <hi>French</hi> had over them were occaſioned by the Pawneſs of their Officers. And it's alſo remarkable that the <hi>French,</hi> who are abſolute Maſters of War, ſet a great Value upon expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced and brave Commanders.</p>
            <p>In Time of Peace, were We to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gment our Force, it ſhould be at Sea, becauſe everie Countrie is to be Guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to its Situation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:38289:13"/>
Laſtly, As Advice is the Head, ſo Money moves the Springs, &amp; ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the Nerves of every State; by which it Moves, Acts, and is Knit together.</p>
            <p>No Orator is ſo perſwaſive upon the Wills and Affections of men; nor no Conqueror ſo Succeſsfull by Force of Arms, as a good Treaſure; and ſuch is the Temper of moſt men, that they ſerve Money with Zeal, and obey it without Grudging.</p>
            <p>It is our Intereſt according to the cuſtome of all wiſe Governements, both to Provide good Funds, and to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the money ariſing from them to proper Uſes.</p>
            <p>There's many ways to raiſe Money from different Funds: Yet the Eaſe of the ſubject is to be had in Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all Impoſitions ſo qualified that they may be laid upon perſons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionablie to their Eſtates; for it's not juſt that all People ſhould be levell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, where Fortune hath made a vaſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it's therefore that all Exciſes
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:38289:14"/>
upon Meat, Drink, Cloaths, &amp;c <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>are equal for all; every Body being obi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to contribute according to their Luxurie.</p>
            <p>If conſiderable Taxes were laid upon <hi>Moneyed Men,</hi> they would be forced to apply their Money upon Trade, where they might have the greateſt Gain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Poll</hi> and <hi>Hearth-Money</hi> ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, being too heavie Taxes for the Poor.</p>
            <p>Great Duties ſhould be laid upon everie Forraigne Commodity for which the ſubject has not an abſolute neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or a way to vent it abroad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and and it would be for the advantage of Trade that the Rates of his Majeſties Cuſtoms were reviſed, and that no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported Goods ſhould pay Cuſtom.</p>
            <p>No Cuſtom, or Taxes ſhould be Ferm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe we know by Experience that they ſerve to Enrich particular People, who have the Art of Jugling with theſe who are Deputed to Examine their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:38289:14"/>
and what Favours are given to the ſaid Publicans by his Majeſtie it would be for the Honour of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that they were given to the Poor, who are never ſpared by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent Tax men,</p>
            <p>Publick Collectors ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for gathering all cuſtoms, and each Collector ought to have a good Salary to make him Honeſt, and he obliged to find Bail for his Intromiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo that the Nation might be Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly ſerved.</p>
            <p>To imploy the Money ariſing from funds, to the advantage of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Our <hi>Parliament</hi> is to take notice; becauſe all Supplyes run in Form of free gifts from the Subjects to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie, for their own behoofe: Now whither theſe gifts are applyed to the publick good, the members of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> that gave them are moſt capable to Judge; and when ther's a good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandiug between Prince and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I believe the <hi>Parliament</hi> will do it's
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:38289:15"/>
Duty, that neither his Majeſtie be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on, nor the People cheated out of their Money and Liberties by pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p>We have the exemple of this preſent <hi>Parliament</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> to ſtate the preſent defects of our Treaſury; to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amen the occaſions exhauſted it: and then to make the People ſenſible of the neceſſity of new Supplies.</p>
            <p>A great many good Laws are uſefull to be made this Seſſion of <hi>Parliament</hi> to prevent ſeverall inconveniencies our Conſtitution is lyable too, and which might ſecure both the authoritie of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>Parliaments</hi> and the liberties of the Subject.</p>
            <p>All Officers, or any body that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon Court, ought to be declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed incapable to vote in <hi>Parliament,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch Perſons are ſuppoſed to move according to the Inclination of the King, from whom they receave their bread immediatly; and that they would doe little for the Good of the Subject
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:38289:15"/>
when it happens that the Intereſts of Prince and People are not the ſame.</p>
            <p>This ſhould be one of the Prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Votes, and no ſooner is this Vote ſtated but all Penſioners become inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to Vote for themſelves.</p>
            <p>We may Learn by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and our own <hi>Parliaments,</hi> how Convenient it is that all Ovetrures concerning the affairs of the People be Voted and Receave the Royall Aſſent before any Supplyes be granted to his Majeſtie.</p>
            <p>But what may we not expect from this <hi>Parliament,</hi> for the meeting of which, we have ſo Languiſhed? but that all Grievances will be redreſſed that the intereſt of the Subject will be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and that every Law will be made that can contribute to the Glory and Safety of this Nation.</p>
            <p>Then let Us lay aſide all Animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and confide in each other, Aiming all at the Publick Good; Let everie Member Act as a man of Honour and

            </p>
