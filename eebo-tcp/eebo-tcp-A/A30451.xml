            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <bibl>2 CHRON. IX. 8.</bibl>
               <q>Blessed be the Lord thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee on his throne to be King for the Lord thy God: because thy God loved Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee King over them, to do judgment and justice.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HESE are the words of an <hi>Arabian</hi> Queen, who was so moved with a Noble Curiosity, raised by the same of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Wisdom, that she un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook a Journey from <hi>the utmost parts of the earth,</hi> furnished her self both with an Equipage and Presents suitable to her Rank, and also with Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by which she might judge whether Fame had not too much heightned this great King's Character. She could not believe the half of what she had heard; and having probably a good opinion of her own Understanding, she resolved to try His with those Questions that puzzled her self.</p>
            <p>But when she came, and found that Report, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of magnifying matters, had been very defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive; when she observed the compass of his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, with the depth of his Mind, and that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied his Speculations to the Arts of Government, as well as to the Contemplations of Nature; when she saw his vast Designs of Buildings (his own as
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65701:5"/>
well as God's House) so wonderfully executed; the Treasures he was heaping up, and the Methods of Trade he was setting on, for procuring constant and fresh Supplies; and that he could join the Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence that belonged to his Character, with the more Real Greatness of his own Comprehensive Mind: So that while he employed his Thoughts in the Sublimest Enquiries, he did not neglect even those Lesser ones, of External Grandeur, which how inconsiderable soever they may seem, to a Soul capable of vaster things, yet are necessary to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain those Impressions of Awe and Respect which give Authority to Government: When she saw the State in which he was served, the Pomp of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, and his glorious Processions to the Temple, she was overcome with Wonder; she despised her own Dignity and Kingdom: And thought that the Subjects and Servants of such a Prince, were hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pier than the Sovereigns of other Nations.</p>
            <p>Her admiration of this being above all ordinary Expressions, she vents it in those Raptures that I have read. She adores the Great <hi>Jehovah</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who had taken pleasure in advancing One who so well deserved it, and who imployed it so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, in raising the Honour of that God who had so eminently exalted him: From hence she conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That certainly God loved that Nation, whom he had blessed with such a Prince, by whose Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Conduct they were in all probability to be established on the firmest Basis: The best Principles and Measures of Government, which would make them Sure and Lasting. <hi>Establish them for ever.</hi> For she could not think but that so extraordinary a Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing must be designed for great Ends. Such a King
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65701:5"/>
would certainly govern them both with <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Justice.</hi> Two words that seem to signify the same thing; yet the Masters of that Language put this difference, That the former relates to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding, and the latter to the Punishing part of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. So wise a King would maintain a severe Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Law against Offenders, and be no less care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to find out the Men of Merit, and to trust, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and reward these.</p>
            <p>Certainly such a Prince, and such an Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are so great Blessings, and so much the greater, because so little Common, so few Instances of them occurring, either in the Observation of the present Age, or the Records of past times; that whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we meet them, we ought to acknowledge they are the special Favours of Heaven, and the most distinguishing Marks of God's loving a Nation.</p>
            <p>The Blessings we now enjoy, and that great One which at this time we do particularly Acknowledge, do so naturally carry us to Devotions like those in my Text, that all my Hearers must be beforehand with me in the Application. But in our Case there are some Specialties that give it a peculiar Exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Solomon</hi> had his Crown, his Treasures and Armies transmitted down to him; Conquests were made for him, he himself had gone through none of those Scenes of Horror, but had an easy Inheritance conveyed from his Father, without Battels or Blood, Fatigue or Danger: He was Bred up to the Maxims of Government and acquainted with all his Father's Secrets, his Designs as well as his Conduct; so that he began upon great Advantages: <hi>David</hi>'s Long and Glorious Reign before him, had prepared Peoples Hearts to Love and Obey him, who was God's
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65701:6"/>
Choice as well as his Father's. The Building so Magnificent a Temple in the beginnings of his Quiet and Auspicious Reign, made him the Delight and Wonder of his People. Thus the Causes of his being so Great and Prosperous, were very visible.</p>
            <p>If then the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Sheba</hi> was so struck with seeing <hi>Solomon in all his glory,</hi> with how much louder Accents ought we to carry on the Hallelujahs of This Day, who see a Prince Raised and Conducted by such a special train of Amazing Providences, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any of those Supports, that every Step he has made, carries in it Characters of a particular Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from Heaven! He has, indeed, the Blood of Sovereigns in him, but his Crowns are the Gifts of Heaven.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>William</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange, Gaspar de Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligny,</hi> Admiral of <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> The Two Great Heroes of the last Age, the Defenders of Religion, and the Patrons of Liberty, were proper Sources to give Life and Descent to One, in whom their Characters were to be Exalted, as well as their Dignity was to be Raised.</p>
            <p>They were Both of a Race of Sovereigns: One was of the First Form; but what might be wanting in the Extent of their Territories, and the Lustre of their Coronets, was fully made up in those truly Royal Accomplishments of their Minds. They were Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the greatest things, and Acted in a Sphere suited to their Capacity: They Talked little, but did Wonders: They had all the Gravity, as well as all the Virtues of Religion in them, without the Affectations of Shew or Hypocrisy: They had none of the Arts of Flattery or Insinuation, yet could bring vast Multitudes to Depend on them, to Trust to them, and to Obey them. They had Souls of so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65701:6"/>
a Make, that they seemed Born to Animate whole Nations to a pitch of their own Courage, to a like Zeal for Religion, and a like Love of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. They lived Great, but died Greater; the greater for the conjunction of their Descent, the mixing those Noble Qualities of their Minds, as well as their Blood. The Issue of such a Union was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to Perfect the Work which they had begun; That seemed Buried with them, but was to have a second and nobler revival in One, whose Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from such Principles gave a just hope to expect all that we do now see.</p>
            <p>One Character belonged to them both so equally, that no wonder if in the Conjunction it is carried to a further Perfection. They wrestled through great Difficulties, and as great Misfortunes, but with so firm a Constancy, that no cross Adventures could ever damp them, or sink them even to the heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to any Propositions, other than what they had pretended to in their most prosperous Condition. So little Power had Fortune over their Minds, unless it was to animate them with so fresh a Courage, that they rose by Misfortunes: They never had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Armies about them, than soon after they had met with such Checks, that their Enemies look'd on them as lost, without a Possibility of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</p>
            <p>The Two greatest Powers then in <hi>Europe,</hi> after they had found them too hard for them in the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanter Methods of War, were not ashamed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themselves to the Baser ones of Treachery and Assassination. Souls so Brave and so Candid as theirs, were not capable of believing their Enemies so black, as they, or rather as their Friends, felt them
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65701:7"/>
to be. But so entire was their Love to Religion and their Countrey, that as they Both perished in the Cause, so One of them in the Agony into which the Fatal Bullet put him, having but a Minute for one single Thought, he ended his Life as he had led it; he died praying for that People for whom he had lived so long:<note place="margin">Una morien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis ad Deum vox, <hi>Miserere Popish,</hi> Grot. Annal. lib. 4.</note> Feeling he could live no longer, he expired with this Word in his Mouth, <hi>Have Mercy on this People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yes, <hi>Great Soul,</hi> thy Prayer was heard; and from thee One springs, in whom God signalizes his Mercy, not to that People only, but to a great many others, who share with them in this Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Grace; the more extraordinary for this, that it is not restrained to one single Nation, but is a Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance to Mankind. These Advantages meeting in One Person, set him indeed above the common Level.</p>
            <p>A Greatness that passed down through Three Successors, who maintained the Lustre of the First Raiser of that State, with a Glory suitable to its wonderful Beginnings, was at last brought under a Cloud, that so the Favour of Heaven might shine the brighter on Him in whom it was to be revived. The Accession of Royal Blood had indeed exalted the Race, and seemed to bring it nearer to that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Dignity, with which it had shined some Ages ago; but it raised Jealousy, as much as it advanced their Scutcheon. The Ruins of Monarchy here, helped to draw down a Family allied to it; but the Restoration of it did not contribute to its Recovery. That was to be the immediate Care and Work of Heaven.</p>
            <p>An Inundation of Conquest and Calamity, forced a sinking State to seek for Shelter to the Issue of that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65701:7"/>
Race to which it owed its first Rise. An ordinary Courage would have sunk at the Undertaking. It look'd like the raising one up only to bear the Burthen and Reproach of their Ruin. The Prospect was on all hands so black, that Posterity will reckon their Recovery with that of the <hi>Romans</hi> after <hi>Cannae.</hi> If it were proper for this Place, it were easy to shew that theirs was the much more desperate State of the two: The Turn was signal, the Effects of it were soon visible, though the Conclusion may seem to have come on but slowly; for now we see a Career run of almost Six and twenty Years, to which we may challenge the Histories of all Ages to give a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel.</p>
            <p>A Mighty Power, Great Armies, well Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, an Uncontroul'd Authority, full of Treasure, and accustomed to Victory, was an Enemy, as it were marked out to raise the Character of Him, who with unequal Forces, and feebler Assistances, put a Stop to a Progress that amazed the World; and made the greater part even of Princes to conclude, It was in vain to maintain the Struggle any longer; it was better to prevent the Violence of Conquest, by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to what Terms could be got, none being thought worse than what was like to be the Issue of the War.</p>
            <p>No Life could be of more Importance than this, which seemed the Soul of the whole Alliance; and yet none was more freely exposed, not only in the constant Fatigue of perpetual Journeys and Voyages, in the worst Seasons, with such an uninterrupted Continuance of lengthen'd Campaigns, that these alone might have worn out the firmest Stock of Health and Strength; but in all the Adventures of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65701:8"/>
War, in the greatest Heat of Action, and in the most desperate Posts. This was a fair offering himself to Danger: Gallant Men knew where to find him. In this only he seemed to forget the great Concern that others had in him, and exposed them all too much, while with a Noble Intrepidity, as one insensible of Danger, he past through many new Scenes of them; but in which Heaven shewed so particular a Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, that the single Relation of them all, with his Deliverances out of them, would make a Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story.</p>
            <p>The surest as well as the swiftest Messenger of Death, attacking him in the View of Two Armies, and on the Eve of a deciding Day, seemed to be sent on purpose to let so many Witnesses see what an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Guard was about him; and that how near so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the greatest of all Dangers might come to him, yet it was to do him no other Hurt, than to leave so slight an Impression, as seemed only made to prove the Truth of so unusual an Accident; that without an uncontested Evidence it could not easily be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</p>
            <p>But while Angels kept Guard about him on all Honourable Occasions, they were no less watchful in discovering and disappointing Blacker Methods, and Baser Designs. Those who thought not fit to venture on him in the Day of Battel, betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the most Infamous Practices. Designs of Assassination were pursued with such unrelenting Eagerness, that as soon as one failed, another was set on foot. A Mind not capable of these, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most as little capable of believing them in others, as of practising them himself. There was no extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Caution used, neither for penetrating into
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65701:8"/>
such Secrets, nor of keeping so strict a Guard, as appeared afterwards was necessary. Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were made by a Particular Hand of Heaven: Men who were thought capable of executing the worst Designs, could not bear the Horror that This gave them. Those who were appointed to be the Instruments of our Ruin, proved the Means of our Preservation: I say, Our Preservation, because we owe it to the Influence of that Sacred Life.</p>
            <p>And now at last, after so hard a Struggle, such a lengthned War, so vast a Consumption of Men and Treasure, we celebrate the happy Peace and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility that we, and the greatest part of <hi>Europe</hi> do now enjoy, through his means. Have we not reason to conclude that <hi>This is the day which the Lord has made; that this is the Man whom he has made strong for himself,</hi> whom he has <hi>delighted to set on his Throne? It is his doing, and it is wonderful in our eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Characters of God's Care of his Affairs have been no less Signal, than those relating to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Good Seasons and favourable Winds have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended constantly upon him. The critical Turns of those Winds that brought him first hither, were so amazing, that those who observed them, can never reflect on it without a constant freshness of Admiration. All the many Passages that he and his Forces have since that time made on the Seas, have been not only successful, but smooth and quick.</p>
            <p>On two great Occasions, Nature seemed to go out of its Course to cover us from Invasion. In the first, the calmest Month in the Year was a continued Storm,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65701:9"/>
till we were ready to make use of fairer Weather, and then we had it; and by a great variety of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, as happy to us as cross to our Enemies, we had the most glorious Day that ever the Channel saw; Beacons of a new form; Fires from the Sea carried the dismal Tidings to the adverse Shores, and scatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Army lying ready to invade us. That seemed to put an end to all Dangers from that Element; we were restored to our Empire on this Sea, which recovered and established our then sinking Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>We found at another time, a no less unusual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing of Seasons; we had a Winter that seemed to anticipate the Spring; the Wind stood all the while in the warm Corner, and broke the designs of sending a great part of our Naval Strength from us. We little knew our danger, and that all this was stopt by a watchful Interposition, to cover us from a second Design of Invasion; we were uneasy to see the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son so obstinately good, so contrary to our Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to what was to be expected at that time; but we afterwards had large opportunities to observe the kind Direction of Heaven that made the Seasons wait on us, and as it were conspire to break their own Laws, rather than suffer a Breach to be made upon Us.</p>
            <p>Other favourable Circumstances shewed us also how God delighted to maintain him on the Throne, under whose Shadow we are all to sit safe. Plenty at home made us easy under all the Charge of the War; and while our <hi>Neighbours</hi> (for we have now no more any <hi>Enemies</hi>) were much pressed with even the extremities of Want, under those vast Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that lay on them, we had enough and to spare;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65701:9"/>
to furnish the rest of the World, and to supply that great waste of Treasure, which came back in some Years faster then it went out. And after all the unconceivable Expence of the War, with all the Losses we made in it, yet if it had not been for the wicked Practises of those Corrupters of our Coin at home, with all the Train of mischievous Consequences that have followed upon them, which was an Evil of our own growth, and that had no relation to the Affairs abroad, we had gone through it without feeling any uneasy pressure by it. But that we have been able to provide effectual Remedies to the one, while at the same time we have so gloriously main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and now so happily finished the other, is a secret Indication of the Power and Riches of the Nation, in this Reign, of which perhaps the most Sanguine could not have been convinced, if they had not seen it.</p>
            <p>Add to all this, the noble Triumphs of Liberty. One of the Common Topicks of the Enemies of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Liberty, is, That upon great occasions, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions in Councils, and the length of Debates that do naturally arise in Free Assemblies, bring such a backwardness and slowness on their Deliberations, that the best Opportunities of acting are lost while they are consulting. Here the Publick Interest was so visible, that a concurrence beyond all former Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, has appeared in supporting Undertakings that seemed above the Strength and Wealth of the Nation. Nor could such a Treasure have been raised by all the Efforts of Arbitrariness; for nothing but the Certainties of the Faith given by the Body of the Nation, could have created the Credit that was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in such unusual Supplies. These went on
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65701:10"/>
with that Unanimity and Heartiness, that we have reason to put this among the great Articles of that over-ruling Providence that has watched over us. If at any time insuperable Difficulties made the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Consultations go heavily, the Season was stopt, the Course of Nature seem'd to stand still, till we were ready for it. So wonderful a Conduct has appeared both at home and abroad, and in all the Elements, as if every thing had been set at Work, either to do us Good, or at least to shelter us from Evil.</p>
            <p>I reckon not among the happy Instances of God's Care of us, our being preserved from the rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Attempts of some wretched Incendiaries among our selves, those Betrayers of Religion and their Country. They are too inconsiderable, to be ranked among the Occasions for which we do now cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Blessings of Heaven. If their Power and Skill had been equal to their Malice, we should indeed have had great reason to rejoice that we have been preserved from a Race of Men, <hi>whose Tongues have been set on Fire, while the Poyson of Asps seemed to lie under their Lips:</hi> but the one has proved as contemptible, as the other was odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. They ought not to be mentioned in a time of rejoycing, in which, Objects that give Horror, ought to be kept out of sight; yet, how little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son soever we may have either to value, or to love them, we ought still to pity them, and to pray for them, that if possible, they may be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered <hi>out of the Gall of Bitterness, and the Bond of Iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:65701:10"/>Let us turn to Nobler Objects, and rejoice in the Glory of God, and in our own Happiness, while we see <hi>who is the Man whom God delights to honour:</hi> whom by a concurrence of many Providences he first led to his Throne, and whom he has hitherto maintain'd on it by as many more: and has now given him as full an Establishment upon it, as Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane things are capable of. He has made his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to be at Peace with him: and while the much greater half of <hi>Europe</hi> own him to be its Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and Restorer, the rest do now unanimously call him that, which He is, Independent on all Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Acknowledgments, <hi>THE RIGHTFVL AND LAWFVL KING OF THESE REALMS.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to make the Parallel to my Text run exactly, a much greater King, lying at a vaster Distance, leaves his Throne and Dominions in the midst of War, struck with the Fame, and amazed at the Actions of this Prince. Instead of a little Southern Queen, a mighty Northern Emperour, cover'd with Laurels, and us'd to Victories, resolving to raise his Nation, and enlarge his Empire, comes to learn the best Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of doing it, and goes away full of Wonder, possessed with truer Notions of Government.</p>
            <p>But while we humbly adore those Instances of the good Pleasure of our God towards his <hi>Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>; let us also with the same holy Gratitude ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve how he has shewed that he <hi>loved us,</hi> as well as that he <hi>delighted in him,</hi> who now sits on the Throne. We are separate from the Continent; and were cut off from the great Affairs of the World, till Navigation and Trade brought us into them,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65701:11"/>
with the more advantage; because our Situation keeps us at a Distance from the Confusions of War, and secures us from the Inroads and Depredations of Enemies; while the Sea that covers us, gives us also a Passage to let in their Wealth among us, and to pour out our Force upon them. Our Seas and our Fleets are both our Fences and our Mines: which others seem to work for us, and give us no other trouble about them, but that of a safe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance.</p>
            <p>All this, how flourishing soever, yet gave us but a melancholy Prospect, while we saw a mighty Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val so near us, rising up to an Equality with us, in that which was our Strength as well as our Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The Counsels at home were then employ'd in Designs of another nature: they were laying down Methods to subvert our Constitution, to corrupt our Senate, and destroy such as were above their Practice. The Laws of <hi>England,</hi> the Charters of our Towns, as well as the <hi>Great Charter</hi> of the Nation, our Religion and Liberty, were all the Conquests that were then projected: while the Safety of the Whole at home, and the Security of our Neighbours about us, were abandoned. So the beloved Design prospered, it seemed to be laid down for a Maxim, That it was better to Reign at the Discretion of a mighty Prince, than under the Restraint of Laws, which was called the Reigning at the Discretion of Subjects. So infatuated we were, that a Competition, or rather a Superiority, in that which hitherto we claimed as a Property, gave us no Jealousie; we seemed pleased with it, and were glad to promote it. We had so far retir'd our
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65701:11"/>
selves from that Share which we naturally ought to have in the Publick Concerns of <hi>Europe,</hi> that we seemed to forget them: We had so much Work at home, that there was no room for Foreign Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. We had been engaged once and again into Wars with those, who, as they are our near Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, so have been in all Ages our faithfullest Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: We fell into Contentions at home, by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of our Enemies, who plaid us so dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously one against another, that they hoped to have done the best half of their Work, by making us first hate and then destroy one another; while they were ever ready to support those, whose Passions and Circumstances might contribute the most for carrying on their Designs.</p>
            <p>All this seemed too slow, to those who thought they lost time; and therefore began to quicken their Pace, and make a little more haste in destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us. Then it was fit for God to interpose, when All was struck at. There was no Prospect of Deliverance, but from one single Corner, and even that seemed doubtful. It was the Reverse of <hi>Elijah</hi>'s Vision; one Hand breadth of a Cloud in a clear Sky gave him the welcome Hopes of the Rain he pray'd for: Here the whole Sky seemed set for Storms and Thunder, while but one Speck of Blue appeared in the whole Horizon: Who could have thought that this should have conquered all the Clouds, and have given the Heavens and the Earth a new Face? All Eyes turned that way, because it was plain there was no other Hope left us: Yet many thought it was too great an Attempt to be expected from the cold and cautious Counsels
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65701:12"/>
of a State, naturally slow, and apprehensive Danger.</p>
            <p>The Interpositions of Providence were not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this Extremity; many favourable Accidents concurr'd; Popular Assemblies agreed then so una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously together, that there was not Opposition enough made to create Delays. The <hi>STATES</hi> seemed to rejoyce, that an Opportunity offer'd it self in this Age, for them to repay what they had been owing to <hi>England</hi> ever since the last. And they were willing to perish with us, if we could not both flourish together. An advanced Season made the Sea less practicable: All was to be put to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard; because all lay at stake. A long Course of cross Winds and rough Weather in the beginning, looked like the Frowning of Heaven. The first Attempt was unprosperous: This would have sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken any Mind less firm than that which animated the whole Undertaking. A Constancy was then observed so steady and inflexible, that not so much as an Inequality of Temper could be discovered. The Unsuccessfulness of the first Step would have damped a Mind that was either feeble or superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; tho' our returning all safe after three Days tossing in a Storm, was an Earnest of a particular Care even in that seeming Disappointment. But after the Roughness of the Season had continu'd long enough, to teach us all to depend a little more on Providence, and to apply our selves more earnestly to him that rules the Seas, and the Winds at his pleasure, and after there was a full and visible Experiment made of the Steadiness of him, on whose Mind Seas nor Storms could make no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65701:12"/>
then God commanded the Winds, and rebuked the Seas, and after that first Rub, all our Affairs were so conducted, that every thing suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, beyond our Hopes, I had almost said, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our VVishes.</p>
            <p>An orderly March of a friendly tho' foreign Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, an unstained Victory, an overturning of that which had design'd all our Ruine, by their own Counsels and Practices, a sinking of Heart and a Giddiness of Head among them, made the way smooth. Then we saw that Success, in its turn, had as little power to exalt, as Misfortunes had to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press a Soul, raised above both. An abandon'd Nation sought for shelter to him, to whom the chief of them had before sought for Relief. All Men were left to the Freedom that became such impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Deliberations, without any disturbance. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Violence nor Threatnings were used, no not so much as the secret Arts of Practice or Insinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Some thonght there was a Coldness of Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour express'd on that occasion, that seemed too Indifferent: but the Directions of Providence were depended on; Men were left to themselves, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to that invisible Chain which encompasses and governs all things here below.</p>
            <p>We pass'd from the Extremities of Danger, to an entire Establishment, without those Intervals of Confusion, that may be well look'd for in so great a Turn.</p>
            <p>When we reflect on all this, and on what has happened since, which must be too present to our Thoughts to need any further Enlargement, have we not reason to conclude, that <hi>God loved our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65701:13"/>
and that because he has loved us, he has set such a King over us? Indeed it is much easier to observe, how God has loved us, than to find out the Reason of his doing it, When we look at our selves, at what we were then, and what we have been ever since, and continue still to be, we can hardly give our selves any good Account of those Distinctions of Providence, in which we have had so large a share.</p>
            <p>It is true, our Religion, our Doctrines, our Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and our Constitution are pure: but those we owe to the last Age, and to the Laws then made about them. All that belongs to us from them, is the Reproach of corrupting our selves under such Advantages: and our refining upon the Immorali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that are but too common to Mankind at all times, by the Profanations and Impieties of the present Age. A new <hi>Species</hi> of Wickedness, that perhaps has never appeared with such Impudence, and in such bold Instances as among us; and yet <hi>God has loved this Nation.</hi> We must without any Compliment acknowledge, it is not for our sake, for any Worth or previous Merit in us: but we may allow our selves to hope, that tho' we have no Title to this Love, and that it did not find us worthy of it, yet it will have those Effects on us, that may engage us to answer its Design, so far at least that we may not quite forfeit it.</p>
            <p>Who knows the Secrets of God's Counsels, or what lies hid under all that train of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Circumstances that we have seen? Whether we are at last to be reformed by them, and to be made the Instruments of spreading the Light of the Gospel in its Purity, to other Nations, as we have
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65701:13"/>
been already honoured to be the Instruments in this Glorious Reign, to give the Affairs of <hi>Europe</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Face, a truer Balance, and the Prospect of a firmer Establishment? For let the Men of Envy and Ill-nature look thro' our whole History, and see where they can find, in any Age since we were a Nation, that we appear'd with so much Glory, and made so great a Figure, not only over our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, but over the whole VVorld, as we do in this Reign. This disposes a Man to hope, that the whole Designs of Heaven are not yet accomplished: but that what we have seen is a Noble Pledge of somewhat further, that is yet hid in the Counsels of God, but is to break out in due time.</p>
            <p>There is no need of great Meditation, of much searching into History, and a depth of Thought, to comprehend this, That Good and Bad Princes are among the chief Instances, in which the Love or Anger of Heaven do discover themselves.</p>
            <p>What greater Blessings can be hoped for on Earth, than from the Reign of <hi>PRINCES,</hi> that have in them the true Elevations of Greatness, tempered with the Bowels and Compassions of good Nature; that are faithful Observers of their Promises, and are severe Lovers of Truth; that not only maintain the Sacred Regards that are due to Equity and Justice, but do generously reward those whom Merit distinguishes, how little soever they may press forward themselves, being as modest as they are deserving. <hi>PRINCES,</hi> I say, who treasure up the Services of their People, and surprise them with such Rewards as become Royal Minds: So that the Fortunes of their Subjects are owing to the Value they set on them, without those Abatements
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65701:14"/>
that will always be made in the Acknowledgment<hi rend="sup">s,</hi> when Importunity or Intercessions are thought to have a large share in the Success.</p>
            <p>A <hi>PRINCE,</hi> who observes well and thinks much, who descends oft to the Equalities of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with his Subjects; who hears the Petitions of the oppressed, and hearkens to the Suggestions of the wise and good; a <hi>PRINCE,</hi> who has the Just and Noble Ambition of meriting Fame and Glory, without the troublesome Vanity of shewing it; who deserves all the Returns of Duty and Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude from his People, without being fond of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or seeing it express'd, tho' in the highest Forms of a Just Magnificence; who is satisfied with this, that it is apparent what all Men must think, tho' it is not easie to them to find out the properest Methods of setting that forth; which sometimes may shew greater, when Surprize does so fill the Mind, that Men must be silent, because they feel that Language is not copious enough to furnish suitable Expressions to such an overcoming Joy; such a <hi>PRINCE</hi> as this, will still be owned as one of the best Gifts of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Forced Rhetorick, and hired Panegyricks lie thick in the Lives of some Princes who have deserved them the least. Perhaps <hi>Commodus</hi> had as many Flatterers, as his Incomparable <hi>Father</hi> had silent Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers. The best Princes are those who feel the pleasure of making their People happy most sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and yet are uneasie and in pain, when in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with what is not only decent but almost ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary on Solemn Occasions, they submit to hear it acknowledged, tho' in Strains far below the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Majesty of the Subject.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:65701:14"/>But the Happiness of good Government is then best felt, when set in opposition to all that Train of Blood and Cruelty, of Injustice and Rapine, of a disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Morals, and a scorn of Religion that black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en a bad Reign. Princes who have a wrong set of Mind, wrong Notions of Government, and worse of Religion, who are corrupted by their own Principles, and more by the Power that they suffer others to have over them, are apt to grow to Excesses that are as insufferable to Mankind, as they themselves are incapable of Cure. Accidents, how unusual soever, cannot reform them, they grow rather the worse for them.</p>

                  <hi>Cedrenus, Theophanes.</hi>
               </note> He was carried so far, as to deliver <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> to them to be a Scene of Horrour and Massacre. Such a pitch in Cruelty animated the World against him: He was judged incapable of Government. He had a mark set on him indeed, but he was sent to live in <hi>Exile,</hi> where he continued ten Years. Two Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours reigned in that Interval; Discontents arose at last, and a proper Season appear'd for him to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt again. A great Party of <hi>Justinianites</hi> was formed in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> who invited him over; when he crossed the Sea, a Storm had well nigh sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that effusion of Blood that was occasiond by his Restoration. One about him ventur'd in that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, to suggest to him that he should vow, that if God would deliver him from that imminent Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he would pardon all his Enemies: But so fierce a thing is a Savage Tyrant, that even under all those
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65701:15"/>
Fears, he could not be softned for one single minute, but said, <hi>may I perish in this Storm, if I ever pardon one of them</hi>: He was as good as his Word. After his Party had made him Master of the Empire, he discharged his first Fury on those who had possessed the Throne: He made two of them to be brought to him; he had the Brutality to trample on their Necks, repeating these Words of the Psalmist, <hi>Thou shalt tread upon the Lion and the Adder</hi>: And after some other Inventions of infamous Usage, he put them cruelly to death; tho' they had let him live, when he was in their Power. Next, he gave scope to his Rage against all those who had been concern'd in the Revolution; both they and their Children were destroy'd, without either Mercy or the Forms of Justice: And because he had been ill used in the place of his Exile, the Country now Inhabited by the <hi>Crim-Tartars,</hi> he resolved to destroy, or to use a Modern word, to <hi>execute</hi> the whole Country. His Army thought they had obeyed his Cruel Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, when they had Murdered all, both Men and Women: They indeed spared the Children; they thought they could not be within their Orders; they might be sold for Slaves, or trained up to War. They were bloody enough, but not to the pitch of a Tyrant's Cruelty. He resolv'd to satiate his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, even with the blood of Innocents; and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them all to be shipt and brought to him. They were upwards of Seventy Thousand. A Storm fell upon them, they all perished in the <hi>Euxine,</hi> where they found a milder Fate than was prepared for them: This gave him great joy, because they had all perished; it had been greater, if he had glutted his own Eyes with so inhumane a sight; but the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65701:15"/>
Pleasure lasted not long; he had now raised all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind against him, his own Army abhorr'd him. The second Revolt ended more Tragically; they were not then contented to stigmatize him as before, both he and his Son were cruelly put to death.</p>
            <p>This Meditation may seem to go too far from the joyfulness of the present Occasion; but perhaps nothing can make us feel it so sensibly, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that we have been deliver'd from, and the considering what might have been the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of a fatal Relapse.</p>
            <p>It remains that we look at the Ends of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as they are express'd by the Queen in my Text. The two great ones are in these words, with relation to God, <hi>to be King for the Lord thy God,</hi> and with relation to the People, <hi>to establish them for ever:</hi> Then follows the standing Maxims of a good King, in the course of his Administration, <hi>to do Judgment and Justice</hi>; to execute Law, to punish and reward, leaving the severer part to Just and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Judges, and taking the Nobler one of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding, under his own Care and management.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To be King for the Lord his God,</hi> is plainly to Govern in God's stead: To consider Power and Authority as a derivation from him, which will be then best ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, when the first and chief of the Princes cares is, to Maintain and raise the Honour of Religion. <hi>Solomon</hi> began his Reign with the Executing <hi>David</hi>'s Designs, and the employing his Treasures, in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Temple of that Glory and Magnificence, that it may be justly reckoned among the Wonders of the World. This was suitable to Natural Religion, and more particularly to that Dispensation then Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God; which was to have its last Finishing, in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65701:16"/>
this great Structure, and in the exact Observance of all those Rules and Orders that had been settled by <hi>David.</hi> In all this, he was to Reign <hi>for the Lord his God,</hi> to reduce the People that was so fond of outward State and Solemnity, that they were thereby much disposed to Idolatry, and to make them delight the more in the Worship of God, by such a compliance with their Inclinations. But the chief Instances in which he was to Rule <hi>for the Lord his God,</hi> were the recommending Piety and Holiness by his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and the encouraging it by his Authority. His Prayer in Dedicating the Temple, gives a Noble In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Impressions that Religion had made upon his own Mind.</p>
            <p>Certainly those who reckon the Title of <hi>Defender of the Faith</hi> one of the peculiar Glories of the Crown, will apply their Thoughts with a particular Zeal to every thing that may promote Religion, both in their own Dominions, and out of them. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies as well as the Solemnities of the Worship of God, will not be thought below their Care. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things, the Contempt and Scorn of Sacred matters, is that against which they will turn their indignation with the warmest Zeal, and against those who do, as it were, attack Heaven, and make War upon it, who Study to render Religion as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible to others, as they have made it look to themselves. What Prince cou'd suffer a subordinate Magistrate under him, who should bear with all the Affronts put on Majesty, as long as the lower re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects due to himself were observed. This may teach them with how just a Zeal they should punish those bold Attempts against Heaven, tho' made by some who pretend to Zeal and Affection to themselves.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65701:16"/>
Such Persons instead of Supporting the Throne, pull it down, by engaging Heaven against all that they undertake. It is a degree of Compliance with thei<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> wickedness, to be pleased with them, to trust them or to shew them favour. But it is not enough not t<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> seem to be of the side of those who fight against God or to abett them.</p>
            <p>Princes <hi>who Rule for God,</hi> enter into all the true Concerns of Religion, tho' not indeed into the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and Violences of those who espouse it: While they check these, they will promote the other in the most effectual manner. An unblemish't Pattern set by themselves in the Purity and Probity of their own Deportment, will give the fullest Authority to all their other Designs. Next to their Persons, their chief Care will be the reforming of their Court and Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and the letting it appear that Vertue and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion are reckoned among the first and most indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensible Qualities of those who may pretend to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: And that Vice and Impiety are insuperable barrs in the way to it. Princes who Govern so, that they <hi>Rule for God,</hi> may justly expect that he will Watch over them and Protect them: That he will make their Crown sit sure and easie, and their Thrones safe and fix'd under them.</p>
            <p>The Second Design for which such Kings are raised up, is, <hi>because God loves their People,</hi> that by their means they may be <hi>established for ever,</hi> that is, in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Phrase for a long time. A Happy tempering of Government at Home, a subduing of Enemies abroad, and a ballancing of Neighbours so equally, that none of them may grow beyond their pitch, are the surest Methods for arriving at a fixed Establishment. We were so shaken at Home,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65701:17"/>
that the Foundations of our Government seem'd to be undermined; not only by open and violent At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks upon Liberty and Property, but likewise by the more cover'd, tho' no less dangerous Invasions, made under the pretences of Law, but against the plainest Intentions of it. Colours were oft gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to excuse that, which in it self carried such a Face of Injustice, that without those Masks, it could not have passed upon a free People. Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess in some of these Attempts encouraged the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers to a further prosecuting of them; so that there was scarce any part of our Law left, which those <hi>Harpies</hi> had not touch'd, and by touching defil'd.</p>
            <p>The happiness of this Reign is, that in it all those Attempts made on Law and Liberty, have been stigmatiz'd, as they well deserv'd to be, but with such mildness towards those who had offended, hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on in the Croud, or betray'd by their Fears, that those who understand not how boundless a thing Royal Clemency ought to be, have, from thence, pretended to infer, That the not punishing Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, was a Confession, that their actings were Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal and Innocent: But a Government that was Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful as well as Just, was as gentle in punishing past: Offences, as it intended to be exact to provide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the like for the future. The Laws have been fortified by new Explanations, which assure us of their true meaning. These have deliver'd us for the future, from the Practices of those Corrupters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Justice, and Enemies to Liberty; nor is this all, but where our Ancient Constitution seem'd defective, and had not guarded enough against the Fraud of Sycophants, it has been fortify'd by the addition of further Securities, which as Buttresses were judged necessary to support the Fabrick.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:65701:17"/>The bringing matters on the other side of the Sea, to juster proportions, the raising of some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed Princes, and the limiting others that were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-grown, has laid the Fears that the World had fall'n under, of being overpower'd by a New Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, and has provided for our own quiet, by stopping the progress that was made upon our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, by which we have secured to our selves, all the returns of gratitude, acknowledgment, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, that can be expected in such cases.</p>
            <p>Both Ancient and Modern Writers have thought that <hi>Theodosius</hi> Conquering <hi>Maximus,</hi> and Restoring <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Second, not only his own share of the Empire, but to <hi>Gratian</hi>'s likewise, was a Subject fit for Rhetorick: Yet that cost him but one Campaign, and in it there were only two days of Action, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Charge nor the Danger were extraordinary. Besides, that it was a just gratitude to <hi>Gratian</hi>'s Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, who had raised him to a Partnership with him in the Empire, to revenge his Death, and to Restore his Brother. How much juster is the Panegyrick! when we see a Prince in a course of many Years carry on a War thro' infinite Dangers, and at an inestimable Charge, and that only to preserve the States of Neighbouring Princes, without any other Advantage, but the Pleasure of having Protected the Oppressed, and of having secured the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; not reserving any one Place, either as a Pledge upon his Allies, or an encrease of Dominion to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. In all Ages Princes have been ready to assist their Neighbours with Auxiliary Troops, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with hired Armies; but it is the peculiar glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this Age, that we see a King, who has main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a long War, led the Armies, and exposed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65701:18"/>
himself to innumerable hazards, only to maintain others in their Right. If this adds nothing to his Crown, yet as it makes it fit the firmer, so it must be acknowledged, that it makes it shine the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: The Gems of it have a peculiar Lustre, a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of which former Ages cannot boast. This is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to answer that Character to which all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces pretend, how few soever of them study to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it, of being God's Representatives, and Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents, who takes pleasure in delivering <hi>the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, setting him at liberty from him that puffeth at him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we see what are the two great Ends of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as they are set forth by this Southern Queen: Next let us view the Measures to be kept in the Administration; <hi>to do Judgment and Justice.</hi> The Generosities as well as the Severities of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are believed to be implyed in these two. The rigour of Punishment being the harder part, not so natural to Minds of the best Mold, is to be left to the Persons of that Robe, who ought to be so cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, that they be <hi>Men fearing God, hating Gifts, and eschewing Covetousness.</hi> They minister in the less accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table part; and to them it ought to be left, except when the interposition of a <hi>just Mercy</hi> softens the rigour of strict Justice. I say a <hi>just Mercy,</hi> for there are <hi>Mercies that are cruel.</hi> When upon false sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, Blood is cover'd, or encouragement is given to enormous Criminals, when they have the hopes of Favour, especially when they see that it may be purchased, this will soon dissolve the Strength as well as the Order of Societies. Princes, by so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, render themselves, in some sort, accessary to all the Crimes that happen to be committed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65701:18"/>
by those whom, thro' a feebleness of Grace, they have rescued from deserved Punishment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Judgment</hi> is the more acceptable part. The Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of this are the distributing of Trusts and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the delivering the Oppressed, and the reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Necessitous, beginning at those who are brought low by a heavy share in common Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, especially those of War, which entitle them to more special degrees of the Prince's Favour and Bounty. There is in all this such a shadow of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, that in it lies the Noblest part of a King's Prerogative. It is not he but the Law that punishes the Bad; but the distinguishing, the employing, the honouring and rewarding of those who deserve well of him and the Publick, is singly in him. All must owe this only to the Bounty of the Prince; yet the whole is a Trust from Heaven; and those who Rule for God and the good of their People, will manage this, as knowing that they must answer it to the King of Kings.</p>
            <p>This Subject is too tender to be enlarged on by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Person below that High Dignity, let us then hear the Resolutions of a Good, as well as a Warlike King, when he found himself setled on the Throne, to which his Son had, no doubt, a particular regard.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psalm</hi> 101.</note> 
               <hi>I will behave my self Wisely in a perfect Way: I will walk with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my House with a perfect Heart: I will set no wicked Thing before mine Eyes, a froward Heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked Person. Who so pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily slandereth his Neighbour, him will I cut off; him that hath a high Look, and a proud Heart, will I not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mine Eyes shall be upon the Faithful in the Land, that they may dwell with me: He that walketh in a perfect Way he shall serve me: He that worketh Deceit,</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:65701:19"/>
               <hi>shall not dwell in my House: He that telleth Lies, shall not tarry in my sight.</hi> I add not the words that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, for they seem too severe for the milder State of the Gospel: <hi>I will early destroy all the Wicked of the Land:</hi> There would be little occasion for this, if the former Resolutions were exactly maintain'd: Kings have a Dialect peculiar to themselves; they will understand one anothers Language, and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate into their Thoughts; therefore I will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to add to these Words either Paraphrase or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.</p>
            <p>But now having looked over all that compass of Thoughts, to which this Noble Devotion of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Traveller led us: It remains that we conclude, in turning the whole to Solemn Adorations, and to the Celebrating the goodness of God both to King and Kingdoms. Our Hearts are now so full of Joy, and our Mouths so full of Praise, that these will inflame us to Hallelujahs, equal, if not to the Occasion, for what can rise up to that! yet to our strength, which will naturally carry us to the highest Transports, the loudest Acclamations, and the perfectest Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that we are capable of. This will go easily; we can hardly restrain our selves from it: Our Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings must go further. We must study to express them in more valuable, as well as more lasting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</p>
            <p>Let us remember and pay all the Vows that we made to God in our Days of Fasting and Prayer: Let us now resolve to live as a Nation deliver'd and Redeem'd of God, and blessed with the most special favour of Heaven: Let us walk suitably to that Light, and to those Advantages that we enjoy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all other Nations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:65701:19"/>Under God, the Fountain of our Life, as well as the giver of our Peace, let us make all the humblest returns of Duty and Gratitude, of Fidelity and Zeal, to our <hi>Great Deliverer.</hi> Let us continue our most earnest Prayers, as well as our highest Thansgiving to God for him. I will not suggest so Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Thought, as the change in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Reign: The difference between its bright Beginning and dark Conclusion. None, how Great, or how Wise soever, are so established in the ways of Vertue, as to be above Prayers, and beyond Temptations.</p>
            <p>Let us all therefore Pray that God may long Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the King whom he has set over us, and the Peace that by his means is procured to us.</p>
            <p>May his Reign of Peace be as Glorious, as his Course in War has been, but of a much longer continuance.</p>
            <p>May he be long the Delight of his People, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter of <hi>Europe,</hi> the Patron of Justice, and the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer of Right all the World over.</p>
            <p>May the Nation still Flourish, and the Church be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Glorious, by his Conduct and Care: And may he be as Happy in the Love of his Subjects, as he has made them safe under his Protection.</p>
            <p>To Conclude, in a Devotion Dictated by a Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, as well as an Inspired Author.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord hear thee in the</hi> Day <hi>of Trouble,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 21.</note> 
               <hi>Send thee help from his Sanctuary, Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy Councels. The Lord fulfil all thy Petitions. We will rejoyce in thy Salvation. Now we know that the Lord saveth his Anointed: He will hear him from his holy Heaven. And we will remember the name of the Lord our God, for we are risen, and stand upright.</hi>

               <hi>O Lord save the King.</hi>
