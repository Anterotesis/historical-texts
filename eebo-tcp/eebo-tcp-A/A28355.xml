            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <note place="margin">The firſt how qualified.</note>The firſt-born to have a perfectneſſe in its Members and Body with Vnity of Spirit, not an Hermophrodite, a Monſter in nature, and the defect of Generation.<note place="margin">As Companies and Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of trades.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Which by way of Compariſon, I mean that all Trades ſhould center in Companies and Corporations, the only Foundation and Pillar upon which a laſting Monument of Trade and Manufactories is to be built and preſerved: for although Corporations and Companies conſiſt of many Members, they are but one Body united, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently <note place="margin">Perfect in parts united in Spirit.</note> being thus compact of one Intire Spirit,</p>
            <p>The Advantage ariſing upon the Settlement of the Comerce of this Nation, by Companies and Corporations, will be theſe following.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. For Council and Safety.</note> Firſt, Where many are joyned in a Company to conſult and carry on a Trade, it's ever more judicially mannaged, both for Profit and Safety, than its poſſible for a particular man to do.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By a Company, Trade both abroad and at home, may be <note place="margin">2. For Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at home and abroad.</note> better Regulated as to the ſeaſon, for exporting goods vendible in Forein parts, and keeping up their valew, and then in making Proviſions for Returns.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, By Corporations our native Commodities may be kept true <note place="margin">3. For keeping our Manufact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ories to a Rule.</note> according to their Standard and Rule, for Waight, Meaſure, and Breadth, and all falſifyings of them prevented.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">4. For raiſing mony for the Publick.</note>Fourthly, Where Companies and Corporations are eſtabliſhed, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of ſuch Societies are known to each other, and as Pillars of the Comerce upon any ſuddain or immergent neceſſity of the Nation, they will be able among themſelves for ſupply of the Publick to raiſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ſums of mony very eaſily without trouble or perplexity, untill the Incomes of the Nation repay the ſame. <note place="margin">5. For ſetling &amp; diſcovering of new Trades.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, By Companies many excellent diſcoveries and Trades have been found out and ſetled, and more likely to be if incouraged, to the great increaſe of our Navigation, Shipping, and Sea-men, as alſo of Comerce by finding vent for our Manufactories, and introducing others among us unknown, which particular men as unable, either for parts or <note place="margin">6. For the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of ingenious men, and fitting them for Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> eſtates, or both, can never bring to paſſe.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, Having Companies and Corporations there will be a means, and that of great uſe, for the incouragement of many gallant ingenious men, by placing them for Heads &amp; Governours of the ſaid Companies and Corporations, as meriting the ſame for their induſtry and knowledge, and ſo more inabled for the management of forein affairs, whereby the Publick may be by them the better ſerved, and they rewarded and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in honour, when ever they ſhall be called to theſe truſts.</p>
            <p>Having thus brought the firſt born to its full growth, and ſetled him <note place="margin">The firſt born ſetled.</note> in his proper ſphere, with ſuch qualifications as are meet for the ſupport of his Dignity.</p>

            <p>The advantages which will ariſe hereby to the commerce of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are theſe.</p>

            <p n="3">3.

            <p>As for inſtance the Accompts with them to be kept to be thus ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>The Importer makes his entry at the Cuſtom Houſe for 100.

Butts by him ſold to the buyer, for that the Duty of them is ſatisfied or paid, which order of delivery, the Importer or Seller of the ſaid wines keeps for his diſcharge againſt the time of his accompting, which may be every ſix Months, or every twelve Months, as it ſhall be thought fit and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for the moſt eaſe of the Commerce. At the time of Accompting, the Importer having his leakage taken off, which is by order allowed 22 Butts, and then produceth his Warrant of delivery for 50 Butts more, remains in his Seller to ſell only 8 Butts, and there appears to have been diſpoſed of by himſelf 20 Butts, for which he is to pay and clear the Exciſe, which ſo ſoon as the Account is made up, within a few dayes limited to that purpoſe, he payes the ſame in, ſo that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears the 100 Butts entred in Cuſtom Houſe are cleared, and 8 only remains to ſell, to begin a new accompt withall for the following <note place="margin">The accompt of all other Commodities ſtated.

            <p>When they make their entries in the Cuſtom-Houſe, and pay their Cuſtoms, let them pay their Exciſe alſo, and for their paying their Exciſe in ready mony immediately down, to be allowed ten <hi>per cent.</hi> which allowance will countervail the advance of ſo much ready mony, and they cannot, neither will they complain for not being truſted; it being certain, that upon ſuch an allowance of ten <hi>per cent.</hi> many that might be truſted will not, becauſe of reaping the benefit granted to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known perſons.</p>

be juſt that they may have ſomewhat yearly allowed them by way of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement from the publike, to incourage them to meet and take this task upon them for the advancement of this Nations trade; which Committee thus ordered, undoubtedly there will offer and be brought to paſs many excellent ways to increaſe, incourage, eaſe and inrich this Nation both in its domeſtique and forein commerce, and introducing rare advantages for the fabricating of forein manufactories among us, and hereby reſtore the now decayed and even dying trade of this Nation.</p>
            <p>Having by the foregoing diſcourſe as briefly as I could and the parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars treated of therein would admit, laid down ſome directions for the reſtoring, increaſing, inriching, ſtrengthning, eaſing and incourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the decayed trade of <hi>England</hi> and its Dominions, which propoſals, though not all, yet if the moſt conſiderable of them might be put in practice, undoubtedly it would very much revive our preſent decay of trade, which lieth even deſperate, and at its period, unleſs a ſpeedy remedy be applyed thereunto; the which is recommended to thoſe that are at helm, and have power to promote the ſame, who hereby are called upon to doe their duty, and all other perſons intereſſed herein for to put their aſſiſting hands thereunto, that what we are now upon looſing may be kept among us, leſt by a too late repentance when the error is committed it be paſt our skill to recover again.</p>
            <p>Many things more might have been ſet forth, and much ſaid there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but with what is here inſerted I ſhall reſt ſatisfied of, having done my part, deſiring that wherein I have been deficient, or not large e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, thoſe whoſe longer experience in the trade of the world, by their perfecter knowledge and conceptions would correct what is here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, and by adding their thoughts carry on this work begun to ſuch an iſſue, as to bring it to perfectneſs, for the good of all the people of this Nation, and the proſperity thereof.</p>

Their Char-coal in ſacks, and that in ſuch as the Colliers and Sellers thereof will make them; which is generally complained of: all ſuffer thereby, eſpecially Brewers, Bakers, Dyers, and ſuch that prepare goods for the commerce, and then Houſholders that are of the commerce, and all in <hi>England</hi> that live by commerce, as well as thoſe that do not.</p>

For according to the age and goodneſs of the Wood or Coal, the price will be; but as to the quantity, being weighed, there cannot well be any fraud.</p>
            <p>The like order might be obſerved in the ſale and buying of all ſorts <note place="margin">The like order might be for ſale of fruits.</note> of fruits, Apples, Pears, Plums, &amp;c. it would avoid debates that ariſe in Markets among the people, and be of great uſe to keep quietneſs and peace; this courſe being in <hi>Spain, Italy,</hi> and other ingenuous places, uſed and practiſed in all the aforeſaid particulars, and is commended to the conſideration of the Authority of the Nation, to do therein as it ſhall be thought meer.</p>
            <p>I ſhould now reſt here and conclude, but that I promiſed that in lieu of ſuch deminiſhments of the Cuſtoms and Exciſe, which many may conceive would ariſe, admitting ſuch free exportation of our Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, and the importation of ſuch Commodities as are imported to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the fabricating of them upon ſuch ſmall cuſtoms as is propoſed; although I hope judicious men obſerving what hath been ſaid therein, haply may be convinced of the contrary, however to make good what I promiſed, in caſe it ſhould in time appear really to be ſo, which as to my own judgement, I believe thoſe two Duties will rather increaſe than decreaſe, trade being ordered and ſetled on the foundation pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</p>
            <p>The following ways I do propoſe, as fit means to ſettle a conſiderable Revenue to maintain the charges of the government of this Nation, <note place="margin">Ways propoſed to ſettle a conſiderable Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in the Nation.</note> which will be a good ſupply when the other failes; and I hope to be owned no way prejudicial, or vexatious to the people, out of whoſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, eſtates, or labours it muſt iſſue.</p>
            <p>It is a maxim approved of by wiſe and juditious men, and eſteemed <note place="margin">To raiſe it on the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a people, moſt approved of by wiſe men.</note> moſt propereſt, that when neceſſity of State requires a duty to be levied upon a people for publick occaſions, to raiſe it upon the vitiouſneſs of the Nation; for thereby on the one hand it may happily deter them from delighting therein to ſave their purſes; or if not, it will be ſooner accepted of, and not oppoſed; which if otherwiſe laid upon the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous induſtry of men, it is for the moſt part oppoſed, and when not, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver taken as a burden and a diſcouraging: and undoubtedly it is moſt ſafe for any Government to puniſh Vice every way, and encourage Virtue; not by burdening the ſame with Taxes, but if any way, with rewards. There be many examples hereof in forein parts, as in <hi>Rome, Naples,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Italy;</hi> where the Princes raiſe great Revenues out of their Stews, in <hi>Spain</hi> upon Tobacco in ſnuff, and other ways taken; then in <hi>Ruſſia</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Italy, Spain, Ruſſia patterns to us herein.</note> and thoſe parts, where the Emperor gathers into his Treaſury a very conſiderable income out of the Ale-Houſes, Strong-water Houſes, and ſellers of Beer, and is one of the greateſt among many in his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the which is done by theſe Princes and Potentates, chiefly to puniſh theſe Vices to which their people are naturally inclined.</p>
            <p>Certainly we of this Nation are not far behind hand with them in all
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100372:33"/>
drunkenneſs and debauchery, it were well if we did not exceed them eſpecially conſidering our knowledge, and then our profeſſion of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity; having more means for to attain to piety than any Nation under Heaven, but none practiſes it leſs than we; and where then can Taxes be better laid than upon our Vices?</p>
            <p>In the firſt place then to raiſe a Revenue in this Nation, let a view <note place="margin">The firſt means to raiſe the Revenue up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Ale-Houſes, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco-Shops, Taverns and Victualling Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and Strong-water Shops, computed to yield annually three hundred thouſand pounds.</note> be taken of all the thouſands of Tap-Houſes and Tobacco-ſhops diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in every corner of the Nation, both in the Towns and Cities. And ordering a ſet number to be admitted in every Town, Village, and City, according as each place ſhall require; and let ſuch be admitted to ſell Tobacco, draw Beer, Wine, Strong-waters, or Ale, or any potable li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, as can give caution for their performance; and ſo upon each Seller of Tobacco, Victualer, Wine, Beer, Strong-water, or Ale drawer, to pay a certain ſum of money at his admiſſion to keep a Tobacco ſhop, Victualing Houſe, or to draw Drink, by way of Fine; and ever after an Annual Rent to the State; and none elſe but ſuch as are admitted to ſell any Tobacco, potable lequor, or to keep victualing; which revenew will bring into the Nation at leaſt, three hundred thouſand pound <hi>per annum.</hi> And this hath been computed by very judicious knowing men; ſo that by this means the Exciſe on Brewers ſo burdenſom to the people, may be laid aſide, to their great eaſe and content, with all what is by the undue practices of Juſtices of Peace, and their Clerks got clandeſtinely from the people, to grant Licenſes to idle people to ſet up Ale-Houſes, the dens of Thieves and vile perſons, to the ſcandal of the Nation, will come into the publick purſe, and none admitted but thoſe that can give ſecurity for their honeſt behaviour and known per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: and hereby none will be prejudiced but lewd and debauched people.</p>

thence forward to Regiſter the Sales and Purchaſes, Leafes or Morga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Rent Charges, and Reverſions ſold and purchaſed by any man, that for the future no man may be cheated or abuſed, as now they be, which would be prevented, were this put in execution in this our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And that after any man ſhall take a Leaſe, Morgage, or lend any money upon his eſtate, and ſhall not Regiſter the ſame within one month, the next man lending the ſame party mony, and Regiſtering his firſt, ſhall be firſt ſatisfied in caſe of a failer, and the eſtate come to be ſold to pay debts, and ſo the ſecond and the reſt in order; And if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhall have lent any money upon a confidence that the eſtate might produce his ſuppoſed thoughts thereof, and it doe not, the laſt man to loſe whatever the eſtate makes not out to pay him.</p>
            <p>Again, after the Regiſters be ſetled, that every man ſhall be limited a time to regiſter his ſaid Lands, Leaſes, Morgages, Reverſions, &amp;c. and all ſuch as can lay claim to any mans eſtate in part or in whole, to put in their claims with in a certain limited time, as it ſhall be ordered, or elſe to be debarted ever after from moleſting or troubling the party poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed thereof, or his heirs for ever; and where Infants or Orphans are in the caſe, their Gardians or friends, and if they have none, they to lay their claim within twelve or eighteen months after they come of age, and if Femals, and maried, within twelve months after ſuch mariage, if maried to perſons that are of age, elſe within the limited time after their husbands doe come to age, and in failing therein, to be debarred from moleſting or diſturbing any perſon that is ſeiſed of the ſaid eſtate; and this will very much eaſe the people of this Nation, and take off thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of litigious ſutes managed by troubleſome ſpirited men, meerly upon pretences to get money from thoſe that are of right owners of what they do poſſeſs and are ſeiſed with.</p>

That a rate be ſet for their pains.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Rules thoſe Brokers ſhould obſerve are,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That a Rate be ſet on them for their pains, which may be one quarter <hi>per cent.</hi> of the Buyer, and the like of the Seller; but at moſt not above one third <hi>per cent.</hi> that is, for all Merchandiſe bought and ſold: and as for the Brokerage of Exchange, two ſhillings for every hundred pound of the Drawer, and the like of the Remitter, which is enough. <note place="margin">2. That they keep a Register of what they do.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That whatever bargain is made by the hand of a Broker, the ſaid Broker to draw the ſame up in a Book, which they ſhould keep for the purpoſe, the bargain to be ſtated in the preſence of the parties, who ſhould ſet their names to what is agreed between them, the day, and month, and time of the day when concluded, which will be the means to avoid many ſutes and wranglings between dealers.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That ſuch as be admitted Brokers, to be men of known underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">3. That they be able and underſtanding men.</note> and honeſty, able to give ſecurity for their faithfulneſſe in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting of their truſt committed to their management; that if ſo be by their default any perſons receive damage, they may be made liable to give ſatisfaction to the parties damnified.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:100372:36"/>
4. That wherein theſe Brokers ſhall by any diſhoneſt practice for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwear <note place="margin">4. For falſity to be criminally puniſhed and pay damages.</note> themſelves, or falſifie any bargain made by them between any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to be criminally proſecuted, and if convicted, to make good the damage, forfeit his Office to the Power of the Nation, and never more to be admitted to execute the ſame, or any other.</p>
            <p>Divers other ways and means very ſatisfactory to the people, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to the Revenue, might have been declared, were our quiet ſo as to encourage the ſetlings of them; but I hope by the five forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing propoſals, I have made good my promiſe for the raiſing of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, which if taken into ſerious debate, and well conſidered of, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly it will appear to judicious men, the Revenue will be much augmented to carry on the publick charges of the government, and the people no way prejudiced, but pleaſed and advantaged. But before I finiſh this Diſcourſe, I ſhall adde four ſhort propoſals more, <note place="margin">Four Propoſals more.</note> which have reference to the Revenue, and to the whole people of this Nation and its commerce, as alſo to particular men more immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted therein.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, that if ſo be the Power of the Nation ſhall ſettle a <note place="margin">1. For raiſing money to bear the charge of the Committee for trade.</note> Committee of Merchants for the carrying on the commerce of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and its Trade, according to what is propoſed in the twentieth Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle for encouragement of trade, and allow them a yearly ſtipend for their extraordinary attendance and pains to perfect what will be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from them;</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſhew a way how that charge ſhall be born by the commerce, both freely and willingly without diſlike or prejudice, and raiſe thereby a ſufficient income to maintain the ſame without taking one penny from the Publick Treaſury of the Nation.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, That if ſo be the Power of this Nation will perform <note place="margin">2. For the raiſing of money to pay all the Publick Faith debts in the Nation, and afterwards to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the publick charge.</note> what in honour they are ingaged to do (eſpecially if ever they expect upon any immergent occaſion for money that the people ſhould aſſiſt them freely therewith) which is to pay to the people of this Nation their juſt debts due to them upon the Publick Faith, for Loans, Arrears for ſervices, ſuppplying them with Arms, Ammunition, or Ships, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe;</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſhew a means how to raiſe ſo conſiderable a Revenue in this Nation, that without prejudice of the people, being ſetled, and the conveniency thereof found, will not only be liked, but approved of, and in a very few years not only pay to a penny all the Publick Faith debts that ſhall be juſtly due to any perſon throughout the Nation, but they being paid, eſtabliſh a conſtant annual Revenue, whereby a ſtock of money may be laid up for the ſupply of all future occaſions that may require the ſame. And beſides hereby regain to the Publick their loſt Credits with the people. And all this to be effected without burdening the Nation with unequal Taxes and Impoſitions which are for preſent ſo vexatiouſly extorted from them by armed men, who are ever the diſturbers and enemies to all trade, Traders, Ingenuous Arts, either at home or abroad.</p>
            <p>The third is, That if it ſhall be approved of to raiſe a ſtock to furniſh forein Traders with moneys at eaſier rates in their urgent neceſſity,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100372:36"/>
According to the purpoſes expreſſed in the ſixteenth means for incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of trade and commerce in this Nation;</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſhew a way and means how this ſtock may be eaſily raiſed without prejudice to the people of this Nation, but rather for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and that not only to the traders, but in reference to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good of all the whole Nation, whereby the commerce aforeſaid ſhall not only be accommodated for their occaſions, but withall a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble income over and above gathered for increaſe of the publike revenue, and alſo the following advantages of the Nation, to the great ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and benefit of the people and their poſterity in after ages.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That all Orphans eſtates of what condition or quality ſoever ſhall be ſecured from the knaviſh rapine and wicked practices of Gardians, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Laws, Executors, Ad niniſtrators, and weak Women, who in their fondneſſes, being overſwayed by eyil minded and unconſcionable men, Ruinate for the moſt part not only themſelvs but their children and their Eſtates, whereby whole fanilies are dayly undone, which would be preſerved were a publick care taken thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That all honeſt and ingenuous perſons, who dying and leaving their children Orphans and remedileſſe without eſtates, ſhould hereby not only find relief for their neceſſities, but means to preferre them in the world by the publick, according as their ingenuity and aptneſſe ſhould adminiſter and give occaſion, be they males or females.</p>
            <p>The fourth is, that if ſo be the government of the City ſhall think it to <note place="margin">4. For the eaſing the Commerce from the burden of wharfingers and their inchroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> be of too great a conſequence to purchaſe the wharfs lying upon the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and that they cannot find means to curb the inſolency of the whar fingers that have incroched upon the peoples right, by requiring unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable rates, upon their takings up or ſhipping of their goods and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, under which the Commerce groanes;</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſhew a way how this may be done without purchaſing the ſaid wharfs and at no great expence for the government, but of infinite advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the people and Commerce of this Nation, and the curbing of all theſe incroching wharfingers.</p>
            <p>Having brought to a concluſion what I intended, and ſhewed the way and means to revive, encreaſe, enrich, caſe, ſtrengthen, and encourage the Trade, and Commerce of this Nation, both in reſpect of its Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factories, ſhippings, Dominions, Coyn and revenew, I ſhall recommend <note place="margin">All perſons deſired to be instrumental to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the dying trade of <hi>England.</hi>
               </note> what hath been ſaid and propoſed therein to the conſideration of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that deſire the well-fare and proſperity of this our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, and withall entreat them unanimouſly to uſe their utmoſt intereſt and endeavour that the power of the Nation may ſeriouſly take into their thoughts our dying Trade, whereby they may be incited to apply a time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remedy, that thereby the ulcerated wound thereof may be healed, leſt if delayed never ſo little it gangrene and become incurable, and ſo both the Trade and Traders therein utterly come to ruine and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. <note place="margin">The concluſion of thi diſcourſe, and the only means to increaſe and revive the dying trade of <hi>England.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>And for Concluſion of all, if we of this Nation do ſeriouſly and really deſire the Commerce thereof to encreaſe and proſper, and to ſtand firm upon a laſting foundation, not to be moved or ſhaken by other Nations, Let us but obſerve theſe few Rules following, and I dare warrant, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100372:37"/>
will undertake that in a very ſhort time we ſhall all ſee our dying trah revive and flouriſh, traders grow rich, the Nation powerful in ſtrengt Wealth and proſperity to dwell within our Walls, Lands, Towns, and Cities, and God will bleſs us, yea we ſhall be bleſſed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we labour diligently and faithfully every one in that way <note place="margin">1. To be diligent in our own callings. 2. To diſparage no man to advance themſelves. 3. To uſe no deceits in buying and ſelling.</note> wherein God hath called us, and not for lucre or gain to intrench upon each others callings.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That we aſperſe no mans goods, or his good name, by diſparaging them or him, thereby ſuppoſing to advance our own.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That we uſe no falſe lights, weights, or meaſures, nor oaths, to ſell or put off our Merchandize and wares, but to deal uprightly, faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truly with one another.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That we ſtrive not to circumvent any perſon in our buying or ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <note place="margin">4. To force no man out of their right by power.</note> (or to out-wit one another, as the phraſe is lately come up) with tricks and quillets, and then by Law to wreſt from one the other what we ought not, and detaining by force either of Purſe or Power the right of each other.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That we oppreſs not each other in neceſſity, either by griping <note place="margin">5. To oppreſs no man by uſury.</note> uſury, or rating what we ſell to each other, at ſo high rates, that who is forced ſo to buy cannot live by one another.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That we would forbear malitiouſly to vex and moleſt each other with <note place="margin">6. To ruinate no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon malitiouſly.</note> Arreſts, &amp; Serjeants, the times being vexatious enough in the ruinating of the commerce, through the loſſes all have ſuſtained; and therefore Traders ſhould conſider each other, and not fly upon one the other, becauſe we cannot have what we would of them we deal with.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That the proſperity of another occaſion not our envy, nor his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <note place="margin">7. To believe no mans proſperity is our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity.</note> better than we make us to repine, but let us rejoyce therein, and not thwart each other privately, but rather aſſiſt each other more and more, and no way to think by the ruine of another we may reap the greater advantage.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That in occaſion of difference between one another, we ſtrive to <note place="margin">8. To ſeek the peace of all men.</note> make peace, and rather hinder differences, than widen them, ſtriving to be at peace with all men, and to have no man, but to ſeek peace, and to run after it, that we may expect that bleſſing aſſured to ſuch as make peace.</p>
            <p n="9">9. That no mans eſtate or riches entice us to cover the ſame, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage <note place="margin">9. To defraud no man to enrich our ſelves.</note> us by force or fraud to lick our ſelves whole, or to build up our own fame upon another mans ruines; nor to believe that by Piracy or Robery, being enriched with an eſtate ſo gotten, will laſt long to us or our poſterity.</p>
            <p n="10">10. That whatever we may have taken fraudulently, or by force from <note place="margin">10. To make reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all we have ill got. 11. To around in charity to one another.</note> each other, be it lands, debts, or ought elſe; Let us follow the example of <hi>Zacheus</hi> in the Goſpel, and make reſtitution.</p>
            <p n="11">11. That conſidering theſe ſad and diſaſtrous times, wherewith God hath afflicted this Nation, let us be charitable to one another, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving each other with our ſubſtance what we can, in having good thoughts for each other, good works and actions, and let not poverty cauſe us to deſpiſe or draw us back from aſſiſting each the other, for with theſe things God is well pleaſed.</p>
            <p n="12">

12. That upon all publick occaſions hapning to each other, we be <note place="margin">12. To aſſiſt others, as we would have them aſſiſt us. 12. To ſubmit to one another, and not to be rebellions in any kind.</note> ready to help and aſſiſt one the other, for no man doth know but it may be his lot to require aſſiſtance from others, and to need the ſame,</p>
            <p n="13">13.
