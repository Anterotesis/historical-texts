            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>To Her GRACE THE DUTCHESS OF GRAFTON.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Madam,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BEauty, as it is both the Theme, and Inspirer of Poetry, so it ought to be the Patroness too;
<pb facs="tcp:103975:4"/>
and a Poem of Love should in Justice be sacred to none but the lovelyest: it would therefore be adoring a false Deity, should I offer up this at any Shrine but Yours.</p>
                  <p>As it is the best I can do, and writ on the most pleasing Subject, I was resolv'd to lay it at the Feet of the most Beautiful, and had I been my self at a loss where to fix, the Universal Opinion of the World would have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected me, and pointed out your Grace for the Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; while the Poem shall last, (and a Poem of Love ought to last longer than any other) succeeding Ages
<pb facs="tcp:103975:4"/>
shall read, that your Grace was the Ornament of this Age.</p>
                  <p>'Tis an innocent and harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Ambition in Poets, whose only design in all they do, is the pleasing others, and in doing that, please themselves best; and as Beauty is the chief Object they bend their Studies to delight; all Poets ought to aspire to please your Grace in particular.</p>
                  <p>That Ambition, is the best Excuse I can make for my presumption in this Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; since I am unknown to your Grace, and perhaps, even unheard of yet; but what is my Crime, is at the
<pb facs="tcp:103975:5"/>
same time my Plea for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; or rather it is my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. The <hi>Athenians,</hi> when they Dedicated an Altar to the unknown God, shew'd more Devotion, and directed their Devotion to a truer Deity, than when they Adored the many they knew.</p>
                  <p>That I might be sure of something Acceptable in this Offering, and not fail to Delight in a Poem of Love, where all ought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful, I have taken all the most moving tender Things, that <hi>Ovid</hi> and <hi>Tibullus</hi> said to their Mistresses, to say to Mine; nor will I allow it to be a Theft, since I doubt
<pb facs="tcp:103975:5"/>
not, as it was their Love that inspir'd them with those Thoughts, Mine would have infus'd the same into me; and no man that thinks na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally of Love, can avoid running into the same Thoughts with them.</p>
                  <p>I have borrow'd the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to every Passion, from those Stories which I thought the most pleasing in <hi>Ovid,</hi> where certainly the most pleasing were to be met with: Some few places in every Story I have Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, but for the most part, I have only kept him in View; I have gone on with him, and left him, where I
<pb facs="tcp:103975:6"/>
thought it proper, and by that means have avoided the Absurdities of his <hi>Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoses;</hi> save only that of <hi>Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malion</hi>'s Statue, but that was a <hi>Metamorphoses</hi> that pleas'd me.</p>
                  <p>It was a delightful Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, to see Life breath'd into an inanimate Beauty, as it would be a killing Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to see it taken away from one already animated: It would occasion as much Joy and Wonder, to have a Dutchess of <hi>GRAFTON</hi> made by Art, (if Art could do it) as it would cause Conster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to have the Gods un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make one. But those Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb facs="tcp:103975:6"/>
of Art are now ceas'd; and none but the Heavenly Artist could have Drawn You, who has Drawn You so, that he has left the Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the Poet at a loss to Copy You.</p>
                  <p>As to the Succcess of this POEM, I hope I am secure, since it is Sacred in general to the Fair Sex, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in particular to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Fairest; if they are once pleas'd, who will dare to find fault? or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige them, by disliking what they approve? Under the shelter of your Graces Patronage, I shall stand, like <hi>Aeneas,</hi> guarded by the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dess
<pb facs="tcp:103975:7"/>
of Love, and no <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi> shall be found as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate as the first to Wound me thro' You. Thus, as all Dedicating Poets, who write more to raise their own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation than their Patrons, I have taken the most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual means to Establish mine; and doubt not to make a strong Party, since every Lover will defend what is sacred to the Lovely.</p>

                     <l>And <hi>Cupid</hi> has his Camp, as well as Mars.</l>
                     <l>That Age which suits a Soldier best, will prove</l>
                     <l>The fittest for the sharp Fatigues of Love.</l>

                     <l>None but Young Men can serve and please the fair.</l>
                     <l>Youth, with the Foe maintains the vig'rous fight,</l>
                     <l>Youth, gives the longing Maid the full delight.</l>
                     <l>On either hand, like hardship it sustains,</l>
                     <l>Great are Souldiers, great the Lovers pains.</l>
                     <l>Th' event of War, no Gen'ral can foreknow,</l>

In various Fields, whatever Chance shall fall,</l>
                     <l>The Souldier must resolve to bear it all.</l>
                     <l>With the like constancy must Lovers wait,</l>

                     <l>All will a while look hideous to their eye,</l>
                     <l>The threatning storm still thickning in the Sky,</l>
                     <l>No sight of Land, no friendly Harbour nigh.</l>
                     <l>Yet thro' all this, the vent'rous Lover steers,</l>
                     <l>To reap the Golden Crop that Beauty bears.</l>
                     <l>So the bold Mariners the Seas explore,</l>
                     <l>Tho' Winds blow hard, and Waves like Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der roar,</l>
                     <l>Rather than live in Poverty on Shoar.</l>
                     <l>Embolden'd thus, let every Youth set Sail,</l>

Let them launch boldly from the lazy Shore,</l>

                     <l>So was I struck, such suddain wonder knew,</l>

From every Charm, the pointed Lightning came,</l>
                     <l>And fast, as they dispers'd, I caught the Flame.</l>
                     <l>Like Stars your glittering eyes were seen to shine,</l>

                  <head>THE STORY OF PERSEUS AND ANDROMEDA: In Imitation of part of that in the Fourth Book OF OVID's METAMORPHOSES.</head>
                  <l>PRopitious chance led <hi>Perseus</hi> once to view</l>
                  <l>The fairest Piece that ever Nature drew;</l>
                  <l>Chain'd on a rocky Shore, the Virgin stood,</l>
                  <l>Naked, and whiter than the foaming Flood;</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:103975:13"/>
Whom, as he cours'd the confines of the Sky</l>
                  <l>Amaz'd he saw, and kept his wond'ring Eye</l>
                  <l>So fix'd, he had almost forgot to sly.</l>
                  <l>Had not the Winds dispers'd her flowing Hair,</l>
                  <l>And held it waving in the liquid Air;</l>
                  <l>Or had not streams of Tears apace roll'd down</l>
                  <l>Her lovely Cheeks, he would have thought her Stone.</l>
                  <l>Strait he precipitates his hasty flight,</l>
                  <l>Impatient to attain a nearer sight.</l>
                  <l>Now, all at once, he feels the raging Fires,</l>
                  <l>Sees all the Maid, and all he sees, admires.</l>
                  <l>With awe and wonder, mixt with love and fear,</l>
                  <l>He stands as motionless as shame made her.</l>
                  <l>Urg'd on at last, but still by slow degrees,</l>
                  <l>Loth to offend, he draws to what he sees.</l>
                  <l>Oh! Why, he cryes, most matchless Fair-one, why</l>
                  <l>Are you thus us'd? Can you be doom'd to dye?</l>

Have you done any Guilt? that guilt relate.</l>
                  <l>How can such Beauty merit such a Fate?</l>
                  <l>I am thy Champion, and espouse thy Cause;</l>
                  <l>In thy defence, the Thund'rer's Off-spring draws.</l>
                  <l>Say, if thou'rt rescued by the Son of <hi>Jove,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Say, for thy Life, wilt thou return thy Love?</l>
                  <l>The bashful Virgin no return affords,</l>
                  <l>But sends ten thousand Sighs, instead of Words:</l>
                  <l>With Grief, redoubled with her Shame, she mourns,</l>
                  <l>She weeps, he joys, she blushes, and he burns.</l>
                  <l>In Chains extended at her length she lay,</l>
                  <l>While he with transport took a full survey.</l>
                  <l>Fain would her Hands her conscious Blushes hide,</l>
                  <l>But that the Fetters which they wore, deny'd.</l>
                  <l>What could she do? all that she could, she did;</l>
                  <l>For drown'd in floods of Tears, her Eyes she hid.</l>

                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:103975:14"/>
Much urg'd to speak, she turn'd her bashful look</l>
                  <l>Far as she could aside, and trembling spoke:</l>
                  <l>My Mother, conscious of her Beauty, strove</l>
                  <l>(Alas! too conscious) with the Wife of <hi>Jove:</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Who by a cruel, and unjust Decree,</l>
                  <l>To punish her, takes this revenge on me.</l>
                  <l>Here am I doom'd a dreadful Monster's prey,</l>
                  <l>Who now, now, now is issuing from the Sea.</l>
                  <l>Haste, generous Youth, our common Foe subdue;</l>
                  <l>And if you save my Life, I live for you.</l>
                  <l>Thus spoke the Maid, half dying with her fears,</l>
                  <l>When, lo! the Monster from the Sea appears.</l>
                  <l>The dauntless Heröe mounts his flying Horse,</l>
                  <l>And o'r the Waves directs his airy course.</l>
                  <l>Let him, alone, his Victory pursue;</l>
                  <l>For dreadful War has nothing here to do.</l>
                  <l>This short Account will Love-sick Swains suffice;</l>
                  <l>He slew his Foe, and strait receiv'd his Prize.</l>

                  <l>And wreaths of curling Smoak, ascended thrice.</l>
                  <l>Half hoping now, and yet still half afraid,</l>
                  <l>With doubtful joy he seeks his Ivory Maid.</l>
                  <l>Doats more than ever on her fancyed charms,</l>
                  <l>And closely clasps her in his longing arms.</l>
                  <l>When all at once, with joy and wonder sill'd,</l>
                  <l>He feels her stubborn sides begin to yield.</l>
                  <l>Soft, was her Bosom grown, her throbbing Breast,</l>

Surpriz'd, and glad, he feels her oft, and oft;</l>
                  <l>And more, and more, perceives her warm and soft.</l>
                  <l>Warm were her Lips, and every pointed Kiss,</l>
                  <l>With melting touches, met, and moisten'd his.</l>
                  <l>Her Blood now circled, and her Pulses beat,</l>
                  <l>And life at last enjoy'd a setled Seat.</l>
                  <l>Slowly she lifts, her new, and fearful sight,</l>
                  <l>And sees at once, her Lover, and the Light.</l>
                  <l>An unborn Maid, both Life, and Lover found,</l>
                  <l>And he too, had his desperate wishes crown'd.</l>
                  <l>Desperate indeed; what prospect could he see,</l>

                  <head>THE STORY OF Hippomanes AND ATALANTA: In Imitation of part of that in the Tenth Book OF OVID'S METAMORPHOSES.</head>
                  <l>
                     <hi>HIppomanes</hi> alone with Hope inspir'd,</l>
                  <l>Might well rejoyce to find his wishes fir'd,</l>

His Passion was all Life, all Soul, and Flame,</l>
                  <l>He dauntless to the Fatal Barriers came.</l>
                  <l>With Joy his vanquish'd Rivals he beheld,</l>
                  <l>Assur'd to win, where all besides had fail'd.</l>
                  <l>He saw the lovely Nymph out-fly the Wind,</l>
                  <l>And leave her Breathless Suitors far behind;</l>
                  <l>Saw <hi>Atalanta,</hi> swift as Lightning, pass,</l>
                  <l>Yet soft as <hi>Zephirs,</hi> sweep along the Grass.</l>
                  <l>He knew the Law, whose Cruelty decreed,</l>
                  <l>That every Youth, who lost the Race should bleed.</l>
                  <l>Yet, if like them, he could not run so fast,</l>
                  <l>He saw her worth the dying for, at last.</l>
                  <l>Her every charm, his praise, and wonder mov'd,</l>
                  <l>And still the more he prais'd, the more he lov'd.</l>
                  <l>Now had he view'd the last unhappy strife,</l>
                  <l>And seen the vanquish'd Youth resign his Life.</l>

When with his Love transported from his place,</l>
                  <l>Lest any other first should claim the Race.</l>
                  <l>Rising he runs regardless of their Fate,</l>
                  <l>And presses where the panting Virgin sate.</l>
                  <l>With eyes all sparkling with his Hope, and love,</l>
                  <l>And such a look, as could not fail to move.</l>
                  <l>Tell me he cryes, why barb'rous Beauty, why</l>
                  <l>Are you so pleas'd to see these wretches dye?</l>
                  <l>Why have you with my feeble Rivals strove,</l>
                  <l>Betray'd to Death by their too daring Love.</l>
                  <l>With me, a less unequal Race begin,</l>
                  <l>With me, exert your utmost speed to win,</l>
                  <l>By my defeat, you will your Conquests crown,</l>
                  <l>And in my sall, establish, your renown.</l>
                  <l>Then undisturb'd you may your Conquests boast,</l>
                  <l>For none will dare to strive, when I have lost.</l>

I would not send thee hence, I would not give,</l>
                  <l>Such a Command; couldst thou but stay, and live.</l>
                  <l>Thou with some fairer Maid, wilt happyer be,</l>
                  <l>The fairest Maid, might be in Love with thee.</l>
                  <l>So many Suitors have already bled,</l>
                  <l>Who rashly vent'red for my Nuptial Bed.</l>
                  <l>I fear least thou should'st run like them in vain,</l>
                  <l>Should'st lose like them, and ah! like them be slain.</l>
                  <l>Yet why should he alone my pity move?</l>
                  <l>It is but pity sure; it is not love.</l>
                  <l>I wish bold Youth, thou wouldst the race decline,</l>
                  <l>Or rather wish, thy Speed could equal mine.</l>
                  <l>Would thou hadst never seen this fatal place,</l>

                  <l>Were I by rigorous Fate allow'd to wed,</l>
                  <l>Thou shouldst alone enjoy, and bless my Bed.</l>
                  <l>Were it but left to my own partial choice,</l>
                  <l>Thou of all mankind shouldst obtain my voice.</l>

'Twas here she paus'd, when urg'd with long delay,</l>
                  <l>The Trumpets sound to hasten them away:</l>
                  <l>Strait at the Summons is the Race begun,</l>
                  <l>And side by side, for some short time they run.</l>

                  <l>Pursue, and save thy Life, and seize the prize.</l>
                  <l>'Tis doubtful yet, whether the general Voice</l>
                  <l>Made the glad Youth, or Virgin most rejoice.</l>
                  <l>Oft, in the swiftest fury of the Race,</l>
                  <l>TheNymph would slacken her impetuous pace,</l>

Then fleet away again, as swift as wind,</l>
                  <l>Not without Sighs to leave him so behind.</l>
                  <l>By this; he saw his Strength would ne'r prevail,</l>
                  <l>But still he had a Charm that could not fail.</l>
                  <l>From his loose Robe a Golden Apple drawn,</l>
                  <l>VVith force he hurl'd, along the Flowery Lawn.</l>
                  <l>Strait at the sight the Virgin could not hold,</l>

                  <l>He takes the wish'd occasion, passes by,</l>

                  <l>This she recovers with redoubled haste,</l>
                  <l>Till he far off the second Apple cast.</l>
                  <l>Again the Nymph diverts her near pursuit,</l>
                  <l>And running back secures the Tempting Fruit;</l>
                  <l>But her strange speed recovers her again,</l>
                  <l>Again the foremost in the Flowery Plain.</l>

                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:103975:21"/>
Now near the Goal he summons all his might,</l>
                  <l>And prays to <hi>Venus</hi> to direct him right,</l>
                  <l>VVith his last Apple to retard her flight.</l>

                  <head>THE STORY OF Narcissus and Eccho, From the Third Book OF OVID's METAMORPHOSES.</head>
                  <lg>
                     <l>THE Vocal Nymph this lovely Huntsman view'd,</l>
                     <l>As he into the Toils his Prey pursu'd.</l>

Tho' of the power of Speaking first debarr'd,</l>
                     <l>She could not hold from answering what she heard.</l>
                     <l>The Jealous <hi>Juno</hi> by her wiles Betray'd,</l>
                     <l>Took this revenge on the Deceitful Maid.</l>
                     <l>For when she might have seiz'd her faithless <hi>Jove,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>Often in am'rous Thefts of lawless Love:</l>
                     <l>Her tedious talk would make the Goddess stay,</l>
                     <l>And give her Rivals time to run away;</l>
                     <l>Which when she found, she cry'd for such a wrong,</l>
                     <l>Small be the power of that deluding tongue.</l>
                     <l>Immediately the deed confirm'd the Threats,</l>
                     <l>For <hi>Eccho,</hi> only what she hears repeats.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Now at the sight of the Fair Youth she glows,</l>
                     <l>And follows silently where e'r he goes.</l>

The nearer she pursu'd, the more she mov'd,</l>
                     <l>Thro' the dear track he trod, the more she lov'd.</l>
                     <l>Still her approach enflam'd her fierce desire,</l>
                     <l>As Sulph'rous Torches catch the Neighb'ring Fire,</l>
                     <l>How often would she strive, but strive in vain,</l>
                     <l>To tell her Passion and confess her Pain?</l>
                     <l>A thousand tender things her thoughts suggest,</l>
                     <l>With which she would have woo'd, but they supprest</l>
                     <l>For want of Speech, lay buried in her Breast.</l>
                     <l>Begin she could not, but she staid to wait</l>
                     <l>Till he should speak, and she his Speech repeat.</l>
                     <l>Now several ways his young Companions gone,</l>
                     <l>And for some time <hi>Narcissus</hi> left alone.</l>
                     <l>VVhere are you all? at last she hears him call,</l>
                     <l>And she strait answers him, <hi>Where are you all?</hi>

A-round he lets his wandring eye-sight roam,</l>
                     <l>But sees no Creature whence the Voice should come:</l>
                     <l>Speak yet again he cryes, is any nigh?</l>
                     <l>Again the mournful <hi>Eccho,</hi> answers, <hi>I,</hi>

                     <l>She hastily returns, <hi>Why come not you?</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>Once more the Voice the astonish't Huntsman try'd,</l>
                     <l>Louder he call'd, and louder she reply'd.</l>
                     <l>Then let us join, at last <hi>Narcissus</hi> said,</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Then let us join,</hi> reply'd the ravish't Maid.</l>
                     <l>Scarce had she spoke, when from the VVoods she sprung,</l>
                     <l>And on his Neck with close Embraces hung.</l>
                     <l>But he with all his Strength unlocks her fold,</l>
                     <l>And breaks unkindly from her feeble hold.</l>

Then proudly cries, Life shall this Breast forsake,</l>

                     <l>
                        <hi>On me your Pleasure take,</hi> the Nymph replies,</l>
                     <l>While from her the disdainful Hunts-man flies.</l>
                     <l>Repuls'd, with speed she seeks the gloomyest Groves,</l>
                     <l>And pines to think on her rejected Loves.</l>
                     <l>Alone laments her ill requited flame,</l>
                     <l>And in the closest Thickets shrouds her shame.</l>
                     <l>Her rage to be refus'd, yields no relief,</l>
                     <l>But her fond Passion is encreas'd by Grief.</l>

In Woods, Caves, Hills, for ever hid she lies,</l>
                     <l>Heard by all Ears, but never seen by Eyes.</l>
                  </lg>

                  <lg>
                     <l>Nature had plac'd a Crystal Fountain near,</l>
                     <l>The Water deep, but to the bottom clear.</l>
                     <l>Whose Silver Spring ascended gently up,</l>
                     <l>And bubbled softly to the Silent top.</l>

                        <pb n="93" facs="tcp:103975:53"/>
The surface smooth, as Icy Lakes appear'd,</l>
                     <l>Unknown by Herdsman, undisturb'd by Herd.</l>
                     <l>No bending Tree above its surface grows,</l>
                     <l>Or scatters thence its Leaves, or broken Boughs;</l>
                     <l>Yet at a just convenient distance stood,</l>
                     <l>All round the peaceful Spring a stately Wood,</l>
                     <l>Thro' whose thick tops no Sun could shoot his Beams,</l>
                     <l>Nor view his Image in the Silver Streams:</l>
                     <l>Thither from Hunting and the scorching Heat,</l>
                     <l>The wearied Youth was one day led by Fate.</l>
                     <l>Down on his Face to Drink the Spring he lies;</l>
                     <l>But as his Image in that Glass he spies,</l>
                     <l>He drinks in Passion, deeper at his Eyes.</l>
                     <l>His own reflection works his wild Desire;</l>
                     <l>And he himself sets his own self on Fire.</l>
                     <l>Fix'd as some Statue, he preserves his place,</l>
                     <l>Intent his Looks, and motionless his Face.</l>

                        <pb n="94" facs="tcp:103975:54"/>
Deep thro' the Spring his Eye-Balls dart their Beams,</l>
                     <l>Like Midnight Stars that twinckle in the Streams.</l>
                     <l>His Iv'ry Neck the Christal mirrour shows,</l>
                     <l>His waveing Hair above the surface flows,</l>
                     <l>His Cheeks reflect the Lilly and the Rose.</l>
                     <l>His own Perfection all his Passions mov'd,</l>
                     <l>He loves himself, who for himself was lov'd;</l>
                     <l>Who seeks is sought, who kindles the desires</l>
                     <l>Is scorch'd himself, who is admir'd, admires,</l>
                     <l>Oft would he the deceitful Spring embrace,</l>
                     <l>And seek to fasten on that lovely Face.</l>
                     <l>Oft with his down-thrust Arms he thought to fold,</l>
                     <l>About that Neck that still deludes his hold.</l>
                     <l>He gets no Kisses from those coz'ning Lips,</l>
                     <l>His Arms grasp nothing, from himself he slips.</l>

He knows not what he views, and yet pursues,</l>
                     <l>His desperate Love, and burns for what he views.</l>
                     <l>"Catch not so fondly at a fleeting shade,</l>
                     <l>"And be no longer by your self betray'd;</l>
                     <l>"It borrows all it has from you alone,</l>

                     <l>"Would go away, had you the power to go.</l>
                     <l>Neither for Sleep nor Hunger, would he move,</l>
                     <l>But gazing still, augments his hopeless Love:</l>
                     <l>Still o'r the Spring he keeps his bending Head,</l>
                     <l>Still with that flattering Form his Eyes he fed,</l>
                     <l>And silently surveys the treacherous Shade.</l>
                     <l>To the deaf Woods, at length his Grief he vents,</l>
                     <l>And in these words the wretched Youth laments.</l>

                     <l>This gave her leisure to discern and know,</l>
                     <l>The several Leaders of the Neighb'ring Foe.</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Minos</hi> their General, most of all she knew,</l>
                     <l>More than a vertuous Virgin ought to do.</l>
                     <l>Whether his Helmet glitter'd from afar,</l>
                     <l>And with its waving Feathers threatned War.</l>
                     <l>
                        <pb n="113" facs="tcp:103975:63"/>
Whether his Hands, his shining Sword would wield,</l>
                     <l>Or his strong Arm raise his refulgent Shield.</l>
                     <l>Whate'er she saw him do, she prais'd, and lov'd,</l>
                     <l>And kept him still in view, where'er he mov'd.</l>
                     <l>Whene'er he shook a Spear, or cast a Dart,</l>
                     <l>She knew not which excell'd, his Strength, or Art,</l>
                     <l>Whene'er he drew a Shaft, she'd swear, that so</l>
                     <l>Ev'n <hi>Phoebus</hi> would himself discharge his Bow.</l>
                     <l>But when his naked Visage he disclos'd,</l>
                     <l>His charming Face to publick view expos'd.</l>
                     <l>When on his foaming Horse he rode the Plains,</l>
                     <l>Ruling with skilful Hands the stubborn Reins.</l>
                     <l>Then like Tempestuous Seas, her Passions roll,</l>
                     <l>Mad her sick-Brain, and rack her troubled Soul.</l>
                     <l>
                        <pb n="114" facs="tcp:103975:64"/>
Happy, she calls the Courser which he press't;</l>
                     <l>Happy, the Launce he couch'd within his Rest,</l>
                     <l>Happy, the Vamplate that secur'd his Breast.</l>
                     <l>Now, would she think of flying to the Foe,</l>
                     <l>And would have gone, had she a way to go.</l>
                     <l>Now, headlong from the Tower her self have sent,</l>
                     <l>And ventur'd Life, to reach her Lovers Tent.</l>
                     <l>Open the Brazen Gates, when Love inspir'd,</l>
                     <l>Or act whate'er the Foe she lov'd, desir'd.</l>
                     <l>Silent she sate with a distracted look,</l>
                     <l>Till Passion gave her leave, and then she spoke.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>In this unhappy War, and fatal strife,</l>
                     <l>I know not which to yield to, Joy or Grief.</l>
                     <l>Tho' 'tis my Fate, to love my Country's Foe,</l>
                     <l>I had not seen him, had he not been so.</l>

Yet might they let their fierce contentions fall,</l>
                     <l>And making Peace, make me the Pledge for all.</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Minos,</hi> and I once joyn'd, our Wars might cease,</l>
                     <l>And that Alliance fix a lasting Peace.</l>
                     <l>Well might your Mothers Charms a God subdue,</l>
                     <l>If ever she could Charm, dear Youth, like you.</l>
                     <l>Happy! thrice happy! had I Wings to fly,</l>
                     <l>To yonder Tents, where the lov'd Foe does lye.</l>
                     <l>I'd tell the dear disturber of my rest,</l>
                     <l>All that I feel, could it be all expres't,</l>
                     <l>And pour my Soul into the Charmers Breast.</l>
                     <l>Give all I can to make him once my own,</l>
                     <l>All he should ask; all;—but my Fathers Crown.</l>
                     <l>This Love shall cease, these fierce desires shall dye,</l>
                     <l>E'er I by Treachery my wish enjoy.</l>

                        <pb n="116" facs="tcp:103975:65"/>
Yet when a generous Foe disputes the Field,</l>
                     <l>It is not safest to resist, but yield.</l>
                     <l>The tragick Dest'ny of his darling Son,</l>
                     <l>Has brought at last these Fatal Mischiess on.</l>
                     <l>In a just Cause, his vengeful Sword he draws,</l>
                     <l>Strong is his Army, to maintain his Cause.</l>
                     <l>Needs must my charming Hero prosperous prove,</l>
                     <l>Then let him owe his Conquest to my Love.</l>
                     <l>Thus thousands will be sav'd, who else must bleed,</l>
                     <l>And daily perish, if the Wars proceed.</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Minos</hi> will thus be safe; and I be blest,</l>
                     <l>Else he may chance to perish with the rest.</l>
                     <l>Some rash unknowing Hand, his Spear may dart,</l>
                     <l>Against my too, too vent'rous Hero's Heart.</l>
                     <l>For who without concern, his Wounds could see?</l>
                     <l>Or who would wound him, if he knew'twas he?</l>
                     <l>'Tis then resolv'd; least such a Chance should fall</l>
                     <l>On him I Love so well, I'le hazard all.</l>

My Country, and my Self, one Gift I'll joyn,</l>
                     <l>And make the Merit of his Conquest mine.</l>
                     <l>To Will is nothing, when we can't fullfil,</l>
                     <l>For wretched want of power; the things we Will.</l>
                     <l>The Gates are kept with a sufficient Guard,</l>
                     <l>And every night my Fathers sees them barr'd.</l>

                     <l>Indulgent Gods! but why invoke I you?</l>
                     <l>We our own Gods, have power our selves to bless,</l>
                     <l>And from our selves derive our own success.</l>
                     <l>The only way to prosper, is to dare,</l>
                     <l>For Fortune listens not to lazy Prayer.</l>
                     <l>Others enflam'd with such a fierce desire,</l>
                     <l>Have forc'd thro' all to quench their raging Fire.</l>
                     <l>Shall any other then, more res'lute prove?</l>
                     <l>Thro' Fire and Sword, I'd force my way to love.</l>

Yet to assist me here, I need not call</l>

                     <l>That, that must Crown my joys, and make me blest,</l>

How often, on the Banks of Silver <hi>Thames,</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>My eyes on hers, and hers upon the Streams,</l>
                        <l>Has she stood List'ning when I told my Flames?</l>
                        <l>How often, has a suddain, sidelong look,</l>
                        <l>Seem'd to confess her Pity when I spoke?</l>
                        <l>Pity I had, though I could never move,</l>
                        <l>In her cold Breast the least return of Love.</l>
                        <l>Pity from her, more welcome did receive,</l>
                        <l>Than all the Love another Fair could give.</l>
                        <l>And it was some, some small relief to see</l>
                        <l>She lov'd not others, tho' she lov'd not me.</l>
                        <l>Say, gentle <hi>Thames,</hi> how often have I stood,</l>
                        <l>Viewing her dear reflection in your Flood?</l>
                        <l>When on her Face I durst not gaze for fear;</l>
                        <l>How often have I look'd, and found it there?</l>
                        <l>How often, have I wish'd my Verse might prove</l>
                        <l>Smooth as your Stream, whene'r I writ of Love?</l>

Say, how your courteous Waves would never flow</l>
                        <l>O'er any any Path where she was us'd to go.</l>
                        <l>Now let your River, like my Eyes, run o'er,</l>

Thro' her he Conquer'd, and thro' her he reign'd;</l>
