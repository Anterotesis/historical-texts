            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>An aduertisement to the Reader.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, after the Printing of this Catechisme, which beginneth with that principle of repentance from dead works at the ninth leaf of this book, I called some few things to minde whereof I thought good to aduertise thee; First, though the former Catechisme seeme somwhat long, and our sluggish natures best like short worke which is quickly done: yet hauing numbred the Questions which I finde to be fourteenescorce in the whole, I desired to certifie thee of this thing, that if eyther other Catechismes be not at hand with thee, or if this shall like thee better then others, eyther for clearenesse of order, or for easinesse of matter, that thou maist go foure times through it in thy family in one year, &amp; yet put them to learn but foure Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions euery day: &amp; by learning two euery day, it will twise be run through; or if they be catechised but twise a weeke, and rehearse but three Questions at a time, it wil be once ouercome yearely, the fruit may quit the cost. Things which at first view seeme great and hard, being wel and circumspectly dealt in, are found more easie, then they seeme for. As in an army, to subdue a great number of men well appointed seemeth a matter of great hazard (as it is indeed) yet single them out by two or three, it will be nothing to vanquish them. The new Testament hath shew of a great worke, yet read but fiue Chapters a day, (&amp; thou wilt spend much time worse) thou shalt go through it once in two moneths and lesse, sixe times in one yeare. Also the Psalmes (being one hundred and fiftie) in appearance a long worke to peruse, yet read but two a day, and thou shalt foure times a year ouer read that precious booke of the psalmes, and haue diuers play dayes cast in: so is it with sundry Catechismes which carry a face of some difficultie to learne, howbeit by a good order being constantly followed, in short space they will be learned, and grow very familiar.</p>
                  <p>In the second place I am to entreat this of thy curtisie, that if thou findest in the foresaid Catechisme any thing eyther vnperfect or vnsound, (for the former it cannot be otherwise as all mens workes are; for the latter I hope it is otherwise, yet we are all men) and wilt certifie me thereof priuately by word or writing, I will thanke thee for thy good will and will trust if God will to giue thee satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, whereas I haue drawne the former large Catechisme into a very little summe, hereunto affixed, containing not aboue fortie short Questions: the reason of my purpose herein, was for the fauour and ease of such as be weake, as well in yeares as knowledge, who hauing first with delight sucked in, and digested this summe, (through the good care of their parents or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours) they may become stronger, and better able to set vpon an harder and greater worke.</p>
                  <closer>Farewell.</closer>

                  <p>In this Verse consider the exhortation it selfe,<note place="margin">Diuision of the text into tvvo parts.</note> and the explication: the exhortation is to stirre vp all Christians to hinder the power and raigne of sinne in themselues, <hi>let not sinne raigne in your mortall bodies.</hi> The explication teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how this raigne and kingdome of sin is to be hindred, namely, by not obeying the lusts of sinne.</p>

                     </note> is taken here for the whole man, as the soule which is but one part of man, is sometimes put for the whole person; as in that saying of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. <hi>The soule that sinneth shall dye,</hi> and where <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Let euery soule be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, Rom.</hi> 13. so on the other side, the body is here put for the whole man, which appeareth by this reason, euen for that our sinnes doe principally raigne in the soule, as it is written, <hi>From within, euen from the heart, commeth adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, murder, debate, &amp;c.</hi> The body being but the executioner to fulfill the deuises and desires of the soule, yet for good reasons the Apostle vseth here the word <hi>Body,</hi> rather then soule: first, because in the propagation of sin it is conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the body into the soule, according to that of <hi>Iob, how can one draw a cleane thing out of vncleane seede?</hi> Secondly
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:2255:36"/>
because howsoeuer the first motion of sin comes from the soule, yet it is perfected by the body, which executeth that euill which the minde hath conceiued, &amp; the will embraced. Thirdly, hauing before spoken of the crucifying of Christ, which was touching his body, he willingly retayneth this tearme of body both here and in the sixt verse. The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning then is this, let not corruption or naturall concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence raigne in your selues, but keepe downe the power of it both in your soules and bodyes.</p>
                  <p>Now for the word <hi>(raigne)</hi> it signifieth here an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute rule in commanding without resistance and opposition,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Raigne,</hi> vvhat it signifieth.</note> such as kings haue in a kingdome where the people are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued vnder them, and doe freely execute and doe their will and pleasure: Thus the Apostle himselfe expoundeth it in the next part of this verse, where it is said <hi>(That ye should obey it in the lusts thereof)</hi> whereof the meaning is,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Regnat peccatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, cum id sponte exequimur, quod peccatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> imperat.</hi>
                     </note> that then sinne raigneth, when that which sinne lusteth, willeth or commandeth is readily obeyed &amp; done without controule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Apostle likeneth sinne to a Monarch or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, whose lusts are lawes and commands, the yeelding whereunto by ready obedience, is the suffering of sinne to play the <hi>Rex.</hi> There are foure steps, whereby sinne cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth into his throne, that it may raigne in a man.</p>
                  <p>The first is ignorance of the commandements, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> shew and reueale sinne,<note place="margin">Hovv sinne get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a kingdom</note> when any doe not know what is displeasing to God, and what will please him, eyther because they are not taught, ot care not to learne, or if they haue some knowledge of the law, it is confused, and without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication: of the former it is true which is commonly said: <hi>the blinde eate many a flye:</hi> and of the latter, that is verrified, <hi>As good neuer a whit as neuer the better.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second step is distrust of heart, or vnbeliefe, when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> God is not belieued and credited in his word of threatning and promises, and in respect of these two, blindnes of mind and incredulitie, the kingdome of sinne is called a kingdom of darknesse:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Radix omnium vitiorum infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litas.</hi>
                     </note> sinne may doe any thing where Gods word is distrusted. Let faith of the word be shaken out of the

heart, then looke what sinne will commaund it is present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done, whereof there is lamentable experience in the fall of our first parents: when they were once won to this, but to doubt of Gods threatning, ye know what followed, they became vassals to sinne and Sathan.</p>
                  <p>The third step is <hi>custome in sinne,</hi> whereby the sense of sinne is lost. Physitions say, that diseases not lookt to in the beginning, doe afterwards in time grow incurable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate.<note place="margin">

                     </note> Phylosophers teach that custome is another nature, and that of many actions there ariseth an habit, and Deuines affirme that by often practise of sinne, the very feeling of sinne is taken away, &amp; when men are blinded by ignorance and vnbeliefe and withall hardned by custome of sinne, it will be as easie for sinne to lead such whither it will, as it was for <hi>Elisha</hi> to lead the armie of the Aramites whither hee thought good, being stricken with blindnesse. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.19.</p>
                  <p>The fourth step is <hi>securitie,</hi> whereby the danger of sinne is neyther feared nor suspected, as in such men, who haue made a league with death, and a couenant with hell; and when it commeth to this, then is sinne in the roofe and at the height: for such as once waxe secure in sinne, and though they sin often and grieuously, yet are they without all feare of Gods threatnings and iudgements, presuming and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themselues bold vpon his goodnesse and lenitie, they will excuse sinne in themselues, and defend sinne in others: they neyther in themselues resist sinne, nor can abide others to reprooue their sinne, but hate them rather, yea, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point praises and reward to sinners, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.31. <hi>they sinne and fauour such as doe it.</hi> Thus wee see what it is for sinne to raigne in our bodyes, and how it commeth to his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                  <p>And here this is first of all to be noted, that the Apostle saith not, let not sinne be in you, but let it not raigne in you: for it is impossible that sin should not at all, be in vs, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the testimonie of euery mans conscience against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe accusing him of sinne, and the manifold iudgements of God against all sorts of sinners in this life, wee haue the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:2255:37"/>
Scriptures in very many places affirming that none can be without sinne in this world;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Beatitudo nostra non in perfectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne virtutum, sed in remissione peccatorum.</hi> Bernard.</note> our blessednesse standing not in being voide of all sinne, but in hauing our sinnes forgiuen vs, <hi>Psal.</hi> 32.1. and hee being the best man not that hath no sinne, but the fewest sinnes. This exhortation then is like to that prayer of the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> in the 19. <hi>Psalme, Lord deliuer me from presumptuous sinnes, let them not raigne ouer me:</hi> Also like to that other prayer of his, in the 119. <hi>Psalme, Let not sinne get dominion ouer me:</hi> And to that petition in the Lords Prayer, which is not, Lord tempt vs not, but <hi>Lord lead vs not into temptation,</hi> that is, giue vs not vp to be carryed away as captiues to sin and Sathan: So here we are exhorted not to cleare and quit our selues from sinne, but that we suffer it not to raigne ouer vs, to hold vs as vassals subiect to his beck.</p>
                  <p>It may be thought that this exhortaion is superfluous,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> because in the regenerate sinne cannot raigne, and in the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate it cannot but raigne. The answere hereunto is, first generally, that <hi>the whole word of God is inspired from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, and is profitable to teach, &amp;c.</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. and second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for this exhortation, a part of the word, it is behouefull for all sorts of men: for touching the vnregenerate which yet are vnder the power of sinne, if they be not elect, this and such like exhortations will take from them all excuse, so as they shall be vnable to alledge for themselues that they were not called vpon to resist sinne: and for such vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate as be of the elect, this exhortation will serue to prouoke them to abstaine from the outward act and work of sinne, which is in their power to do, euen by the strength of restraining grace, the which preuaileth in many naturall men, not onely to keepe them from externall euill actions, but to the staying somewhat of the inward rage of sinne, though they cannot kill it at the roote, for lack of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming grace. And least of all may this exhortation be held vnprofitable for such elect as be already regenerate, who are greatly holpen to the mortification of sin by the work of the spirit, through this word of exhortation. Wee are
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:2255:38"/>
taught from the word, that such as once receiue the grace of regeneration, though they may grieuously fall, yet that it is vnpossible they should fall away; because the seed whereof they are begotten anew is immortall and permanent, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. And Christ Iesus which prayed for <hi>Peters</hi> perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in grace, hath prayed for the stabilitie of all true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers: <hi>Iohn.</hi> 17.20.21. Yet that exhortation in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. <hi>Let him that standeth, take heede least hee fall:</hi> and that <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. <hi>Worke out your saluation in feare and trembling</hi> is not in vaine for them, because it may moue them to feare and vvatchfulnesse, which is one meane whereby they stand. In like manner albeit sinne cannot euer haue dominion in the elect, being once effectually called and turned to God, yet it is good for them to be called vpon, to resist and striue against the raigne of sinne, because by such exhortations being blessed from heauen, and put in practise, the course of sinning is stopped in them, and the strength of sinne daily lessened and abated, till it be wholy abolished and brought to nothing.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer obserue from this exhortation of our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, that it is the dutie and part of euery faithfull man and woman, to take paines to preserue and encrease their owne mortification, and that they may not looke that Christ and his grace will beare and carry them through against all as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults of their sinfull lusts: without their owne care, trauaile and endeauour, and this is the very thing which is here cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, for that they be helpers to the grace of Christ in the suppressing of sinne, for howsoeuer in our first conuersion wee are meere patients, not working any thing toward it, onely suffering the spirit to worke that blessed change and conuersion of our soules to God, and howsoeuer it is the grace of God which still doth all our workes for vs, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, middle or end of our sanctification, being from grace, which both beginneth and finisheth, yet the grace of God worketh not in those which lye asleepe and snort in their sinnes being carelesse and idle, but in them which put to their owne care and diligence; as in husbandry all the

                  <p>But we are entred into an Ocean of matter, which would quickly ouer-flow the bancke of a Sermon, if wee should not obserue some meane, therfore to leaue the further search of reasons, scattered euery where in this present Chapter, &amp; else where in Scripture, let vs attend now to the reasons couched in this present text, which are but two: the former reason is contained in the particle <hi>(Therefore)</hi> which impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thus much, that sithens Christ hath put in vs his grace of sanctification, to crucifie our sinfull nature, (as hee had
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:2255:41"/>
taught before) therefore let vs not be wanting to our selues, to whom Christ hath not beene wanting, if he hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy broken the yoke and strength of sinne by his death, now it is pulled downe, let vs keepe it downe, and neuer suffer it to arise and get head againe. When <hi>Dauid</hi> had smitten <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah</hi> to the ground, hee presently runne vpon him, drew out his sword and beheaded him: likewise Christ hauing sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued vnto vs our sinne by his vertue, let vs doe our part &amp; fall vpon it, take it by the throate, stifle and choake it, neuer leaue it till wee haue driuen out the breath of sinne. It was the fault of the Israelites that God hauing put them in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of a good land and destroyed many of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, daunting the rest, they by their negligence and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardise did not prosecute these good beginnings, but suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Cananites to liue amongst them, they proued thornes in their sides, and prickes in their eyes; euen so it will come passe, if you foreslow the continuall mortifying of sinne, which Christ hath already conquered in you, and disarmed, if ye make way and giue place to remayning lusts and euill affections, they will proue tedious and perillous: <hi>therefore let not sinne raigne.</hi>

And surely, this may encourage any good Christian to resist sinne seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to consider that we are mortall here, where sinne doth assault vs, and that there wee shall be immortall, where wee shall be free from sinne: as wee would not be mortall then, when sinne shall not hurt vs, so we would not be immortall here, where we are subiect to sinne.</p>
                  <p>Let this meditation then helpe vs against the lusts of sinne, that wee are not like to wrestle long with it; for our yeares may lack moneths, our moneths may lacke weekes, our weekes may lacke dayes, our dayes may lacke houres, our houres may lacke minutes.

Moreouer, wee in this Citie haue almost euery day death roung in our eares, the deadly knell telling vs that dust we are, and to dust we must goe. Lastly, our nightly sleepe being to vs a shadow and resemblance of death, yet for all this men liue as if they were immortall, drowned in worldly pleasures, and carnall delights, because they doe not seriously remember their last end, which if it were carefully thought vpon, it would mightely preuaile to keepe men from doing amisse, causing them to imitate that

                  </p>
                  <p>First, vnto the substance of the Psalme belongeth a question and an answere: the question is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in the first Verse, <hi>O Lord who shall dwell in thy Tabernacle?</hi> that is to say, O Lord, whereas there be many that resort vnto thy Tabernacle to worship thee, certifie me who they are which be thy true worshippers, whom thou wilt account to be members of thy Church militant in earth, and triumphant in heauen.</p>
                  <p>This is the greatest question in all diuinitie, for though there be other questions of deeper search, yet of all other this question is of greatest vse and consequence. The reason that caused <hi>Dauid</hi> to moue this question was this, hee mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked many to frequent the Temple to worship, which yet proued but hypocrites, therefore very worthily he enquired of God, the iudge of the heart, by what tokens his sound worshippers and seruants might be knowne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:2255:47"/>Secondly, the answere beginneth at the second Verse, which containeth a full description of true worshippers, by three essentiall vnseparable notes, to wit: first, Integritie: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Innocencie: thirdly, Veritie; vnto which three graces are referred all the particular duties in the Verses following.</p>

                     </note>The doctrines which arise from this Verse are two: the formost is this, The blessed estate of the true worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of God is certaine and vnchangeable, from which they shall neuer be remoued: the second doctrine is, who be these true worshippers and how to be knowne. The first doctrine is built vpon many vndoubted grounds: the first ground is from the <hi>Authoritie of Scripture,</hi> expresly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming this truth in many places,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 paragraph">

                     </note> 
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 1.6. <hi>The Lord know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the way of the righteous, and the way of the wicked shall perish. Psalme.</hi> 37.24.<hi>Though the righteous fall, hee shall not be cast off, for the Lord puts vnder his hand.</hi> Also <hi>Psalme</hi> 125. <hi>Hee that trusts in the Lord shall be like mount Sion, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be remoued:</hi> Also <hi>Salomon</hi> saith in his <hi>Prouerbs: The hope of the righteous shall not perish</hi>: And to be short, in the 54. of <hi>Isaiah</hi> the Lord hath sworne to his people by an oath, that with euerlasting loue hee hath embraced them. Wee see in these Scriptures that God hath passed for the stable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his people, not his single word onely, but his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, which is his double word, and if this be not strong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, it hath pleased him for more surety to adde his oath, a three-fold corde which cannot be broken.</p>
                  <p>The second ground is <hi>Gods free election,</hi> vpon which the firme stedfastnesse of the faithfull is grounded, as vpon a sure rocke and mountaine of brasse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> which causeth our
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:2255:47"/>
Sauiour Christ to say,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> that it was not possible for the Elect to be deceiued. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. True it is that in some things the elect may be deceiued, and for some time: but to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vniuersally, and for euer, that is not possible. And in the 8. to the <hi>Romanes, Paul</hi> respecting the constancie of Gods election, auoucheth of the predestinate, that they must be glorified. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. Moreouer in the 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. hauing spoken of <hi>Hymineus</hi> and <hi>Phyletus,</hi> which themselues deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the faith, and destroyed the faith of others, by saying the Resurrection is past, the Apostle fearing least some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers of weake mindes should be troubled to heare two such pillers of the Church to be shaken: hee doth comfort them with this perswasion, that their owne standing is firme because of Gods election, which for the assurance and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of it is there likened to a foundation and a seale: two such things then which amongst men there is no stronger,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                     <hi>The foundation</hi> (saith he) <hi>of God is sure, hauing his seale: the Lord knoweth who are his.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third ground is the free and vnchangeable couenant that God hath stricke with his elect touching grace and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation by Christ. The tenour whereof is to be found in <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie.</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 32.38.39. &amp; 40. verses, <hi>And I will make an euerlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing couenant with them, that I will neuer turne away from them to doe them good, but I will put my feare into their hearts, that they shall not depart from me,</hi> (saith the Lord.) These are the words of the couenant, from which obserue two things: the first is, that hee cals it <hi>an euerlasting couenant</hi>: which tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth that it is not made for houres, dayes, weeks, moneths, yeares, or any tearme of time, but for all eternitie. The second is the meanes how this couenant becomes euerlasting, because it is euery way sure and constant both on Gods part who neuer altereth his good will towards his chosen people; and on his peoples part, who haue their hearts so seasoned with his feare as they can neuer haue a will to depart from him. This third ground from the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is further strengthened with the consideration of gods infinit power and truth, which maketh him able and carefull
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:2255:48"/>
to performe vnto the elect his most mercifull couenant: Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> assured himselfe of the fruit of Gods co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant, looking to the power of God, who was able to doe what he promised<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.21. And <hi>Paul</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth the mindes of the godly by the truth of God, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full is he who promiseth, and he will doe it.</p>
                  <p>The fourth ground is the intercession of Christ, who as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> by his death he purchased for the elect Gods fauour, so by his prayer he keepeth them for euer in his fauour: thus hee prayed for <hi>Peter</hi> that his faith might not faile, <hi>Luke.</hi> 22.32. So in <hi>Iohn</hi> the 17. he prayeth not only for <hi>Peter</hi> &amp; the other Apostles, but for all that should beleeue their doctrine to the end of the world, that they might be kept to euerlasting life. Whereof it followeth necessarily that the true children of God must for euer stand in the fauour of God vnremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, or else the prayer of our Lord Iesus Christ must be vnheard and cast out, which were great wickednes once to imagine: especially seeing Christ himselfe hath said, <hi>Father I know thou hearest me alwaies. Iohn.</hi> 11.42.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The fift ground is the nature of spirituall and sauing grace, which is permanent and not subiect to corruption, as appeareth by the words of our Sauiour, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. <hi>my Ioy shall none take from you.</hi> Also in the 16. verse he saith, <hi>my spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which I giue to you shall abide with you for euer.</hi> And Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in his first Epistle 1.13. calleth the seed whereof we are begotten anew, <hi>immortall seede</hi>: and Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, it remayneth in them which are borne anew: and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that <hi>the gifts of God are without repentance, Rom.</hi> 11. All which places doe serue to teach vs thus much; that the sauing grace of God is of an incorruptible nature, such as neuer dyeth where it once quickneth. The reason whereof is, because God who giueth it doth still preserue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it, as it is written, <hi>Iude</hi> 1. <hi>sanctified of God the Father, and reserued to Iesus Christ.</hi> Which sheweth that whom God sanctifieth by one grace, he confirmeth by another.</p>
                  <p>They therefore are deceiued which thinke that the grace of God though it cannot finally be lost and for euer yee
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:2255:48"/>
that it may be lost wholy for a time, whereas contrariwise the Apostle teacheth in the sixt to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> that the elect hauing once the life of grace from the spirit of Christ can no more returne to the death of sinne, then Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing raised from the dead can returne to the graue againe, verse 9.10.11. reade and consider the place.</p>
                  <p>Besides all these grounds already named, there remaine some other, as the constancie of the loue of God, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> reicteth nor casteth out such as once in loue hee em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth. <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.1. Moreouer the faithfull are committed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> of the father to Christ to be kept, who being stronger then all, none can plucke them out of his hands. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 10.28. Our saluation was once in our owne keeping for it was committed vnto <hi>Adam,</hi> who quickly lost it, but now God hauing trusted his sonne with it, and made him the gardian of it, it is in a most sure hand: for he being both almightie &amp; faithfull, can and will saue all that be of his father commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, as himselfe saith, <hi>I will raise them vp at the last day and giue them eternall life.</hi> Finally, it cannot be that any of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Gods children can be lost, but that the truth, power, and good will of God must be called in question; for if any of them should perish, it must be for that God regardeth not his promise, or is not able to keepe it, or vnwilling to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it.</p>
                  <p>This stedfast condition of Gods children besides these substantiall grounds of it fetched from the word, it is also in the same word illustrated and set forth by many sensible and fit similitudes.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> The first is of a tree planted by the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of water, which hath such continuall supply of plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> moysture, as that neither leafe nor fruit doth euer fade. <hi>Psalme</hi> 1.2. The second is of a Cedar in Libanon, which as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it is tall for height, and mighty in strength, so it is lasting for continuance: long it is before it beare fruit, but when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to beare, it beareth very long, and the longer it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth the more fruit it beareth: so it fareth with the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, as it is written. <hi>Psal.</hi> 92.12. Thirdly, of an huge,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> firme and vnpregnable mountaine, which by no engine
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:2255:49"/>
of warre, nor by any are or labour of man can be wonne and preuayled against: Such is the estate of him that trusts in God, <hi>Psalme</hi> 125.1.2. The last similitude is of an house built vpon a rocke, against which though the windes and waues doe blow and beat, yet it standeth sure, because it is founded vpon a rocke: so it is with euery one that heareth the word of GOD <note place="margin">

                  <p>Furthermore, the word that thus speaketh of the sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnesse of Gods true worshippers, doth also direct vs to the meanes by which they are maintained in it: and these are either publicke or priuate. The publike meanes are the ministry of the word and Sacraments,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 paragraph">

                     </note> and prayer and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline. The priuate meanes are priuate prayer, meditation and reading, fellowship of the godly, conference, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full practise of the word. By these meanes vsed and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with sinceritie, humilitie, and vnwearied constancie, it pleaseth the most mercifull God to keepe all his children from falling away though they take some deepe and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fals.</p>
                  <p>Now it will be requisite briefly to answere some such ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections as are made against this doctrine, which is much gainesaid, as all other diuine truth is: the truth of the word being herein like the word, the truth, Christ I meane, who was spoken against by sinners.</p>
                  <p>These obiections are either first by examples of the Saints: secondly, by texts of Scripture: or thirdly, by shew of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> reason.

Secondly, hee was one of the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Scripture, euen an holy Prophet: and of all the holy Prophets Christ saith they are set downe in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God. <hi>Luke</hi> 13.28. Thirdly, Gods promise was made especially touching the person of <hi>Salomon,</hi> that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer his sinnes should be corrected with the rod of men, yet his mercy hee would neuer take from him, nor remoue his louing kindenesse. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. Fiftly, hee was by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance restored to God and to his Church, and none can pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish that truely repent. Now that <hi>Salomon</hi> repented may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare both by the title of his Booke, called <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> which is as much to say,<note place="margin">Thus <hi>Tremelius</hi> expoundeth it.</note> as a person vnited againe to the Church vpon his repentance done and published in the Church: and by the argument of that Booke, which is a large condemning of those vanities wherewith he had been ouer-taken, and a plaine retractation of those follyes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee had offended.

When the Apostles of Christ were sent forth to preach, they reioyced that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels were subdued vnto them, but our Sauiour biddeth them reioyce in this rather, <hi>that their names were written in the Booke of life</hi>: teaching vs hereby, that howsoeuer there is great cause of ioy and thanksgiuing vnto God, when any one is made the meanes to pull any soule out of the snares of the Diuell, yet the chiefest cause of ioy and praise is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, when any one vnderstandeth of himselfe, that hee is the Elect of God, and sure to be saued.

from his wofull estate in which hee liued whilst hee was a blinde superstitious Pharisee, serued God in shewes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall obseruations, and at length translated into this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable estate of faithfull worshippers of God, he brast forth into most thankfull acknowledgment of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse herein, <hi>Now</hi> (saith he) <hi>to the immortall and onely wise God be praise and honour for euer.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, from this doctrine ariseth a comfort to Gods <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> children against the temptation of being vtterly forsaken, because being so surely built vpon the rocke,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.</note> the gates of hell, euen the strongest assaults of Sathan, cannot preuaile against them; heaven and earth shall sooner be remoued then any of Gods seruants. For if Gods election be vnchangable, if his couenant be euerlasting and vnuiolable, if his truth cannot alter, nor his mercy faile, nor his power be weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, if the prayers of Iesus Christ cannot be refused and cast out, if his Scriptures cannot lye and deceiue, if his sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying grace cannot dye and perish, then beleeue it though sinfull lusts rebell, the vaine world entise, the Diuell tempt and rage, raysing vp troubles without and terrours within, yea though our selues in our feares and faintings sinck &amp; be ready to giue ouer, yet being once his we are euer his, and though we be down, we shal be raised vp, thogh we be sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, we shall neuer be remoued: as <hi>Dauid</hi> said out of his owne experience touching temporall prouision for this life, <hi>I have ben young and now am old, yet I neuer knew the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous forsaken, nor their seede begging their bread:</hi> so I may appeale to the experience of all that euer haue beene young and are become old concerning eternall preseruation, if euer they knew a man truely fearing and trusting in God (how weakely so euer it were) to be confounded.</p>
                  <p>The fourth and last profit to be made of this doctrine, is to stirre vp euery one of vs to a meruailous great care to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> looke to our selues, and to watch ouer our soules,<note place="margin">This also is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother marke that a man is in this vnmouea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition.</note> conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that God who made vs without our selues, yet doth not preserue vs without our selues, but vseth our owne wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinesse and endeauour therevnto. This is that which one of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:2255:52"/>
the Fathers hath wel and truely said, <hi>tutus si attonitus, securus si cantus,</hi> that is to say, thou art safe so thou beest wary, thou art sure so thou beest astonished and tremblest: agreeable to that in the second Psalme, <hi>serue the Lord in feare</hi>; and to that in the second of the <hi>Philippians, worke out your saluation with feare and trembling.</hi> It is a rule of pollicie by <hi>Philip de Commines</hi> in his French historie, namely, that <hi>mistrust is safe:</hi> and surely it is a good rule in diuinitie, <hi>a Christian is most safe that is most mistrustfull.</hi> First, the Diuell is much to be mustrusted, considering his deepe subtilitie and long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and so much the more to be mistrusted because hee is an inuisible enimie, and therefore the harder to espye his assaults, or to auoide them: and blessed is the soule that is alwayes iealous &amp; mistrustfull ouer that cursed fiend, which casteth his baytes and his snares to catch vs in euery thing, in our apparell, meat, and company, &amp;c. in hearing, reading and prayer, in speaking and doing. Secondly, it is good to be mistrustfull of men, both friends and enimies, both igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and prophane, that we be not corrupted by their euill example, wicked company, indiscreet or euill counsell and perswasion:<note place="margin">

                     </note> euen <hi>Peter</hi> will giue ill aduise, and <hi>Nathan</hi> may giue counsell which God will checke. Lastly, and aboue all, it behoues vs to be mistrustfull ouer our selues, and ouer our owne corrupt reason and affections, as wrath, pride, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes, &amp; such like, which are euer ready to betray vs into the hands of our enimie Sathan: and they are so much the more to be mistrusted, by how much they are nearer vnto vs, being in the middest of vs (as it were) within our bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, and bearing a great shew of being our friends, fawning vpon vs whiles secretly they giue vs the stab at the hart. In which respect they are of the Apostle worthely termed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull lusts. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>Thus far of the first doctrine, concerning the vnmoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able steadfastnesse of Gods true worshippers. Now a few words of the second doctrine, which is this: The markes whereby the true worshippers of God may be knowne who they be, to themselues and to others. <hi>He that doth these
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:2255:52"/>
things,</hi> he is the true worshipper, and <hi>shall neuer be remoued.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The markes then whereby they are knowne, are the things set downe in this Psalme: <hi>He that doth these things,</hi> what <hi>things?</hi> not superstitious workes deuised by men, not ceremonious workes, though commanded by God, for these things may be done of hipocrits: but the workes and fruits of true sanctification they are the markes by which Gods true worshippers and children are knowne. In the eight to the <hi>Romane's,</hi> the Apostle teacheth that Gods children may be knowne by the witnesse of Gods spirit: <hi>the spirit it selfe</hi> (saith he) <hi>beareth witnesse to our spirits that we are the sonnes of God.</hi> This certainely is most true because it is written in the Scriptures, the word of truth: howbeit it is no easie thing euen for the very sonnes of God to finde out this testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in themselues, &amp; many haue ben deceiued by taking a carnall presumption instead of the testimonie of the spirit: Therefore if there be any to whom it is certified by an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent &amp; liuely witnesse of the spirit, that they are the sonnes of God, they haue much to prayse God for it: but if there be any in whom this witnesse is feeble and darke, let them not be discouraged:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> for as true fire is well discerned from painted fire by the heat it giues, though ther be neither light nor flame; so it may be as well knowne who be the children of God by the workes and fruits of the spirit, as by the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the spirit: they which want this latter may haue cause to be glad if they haue the former. For the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> in the first chapter of his second Epistle, hauing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted the Christians to ioyne to their <hi>faith knowledge, to knowledge vertue, to vertue temperance, to temperance pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to patience brotherly kindnesse, to brotherly kindnesse loue,</hi> he assureth them that if these things be in them and abound they should neuer fall, but haue their election sure, and haue an entrance made into the blessed kingdome of God. And to conclude, our Prophet in this Psalme, vnto that questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>(who shall dwell in thy Tabernacle?)</hi> makes this answere, <hi>euen hee that deales vprightly toward God and man, hee that liueth a iust life, hee that thinketh the truth, and speaketh as
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:2255:53"/>
hee thinketh, hee that hurteth not his neighbour in name, bodie, goods or soule, he that neither spreadeth nor receiueth false re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port against his brother, he that loueth godly men though they be hated in the world, and flattereth not wicked men though they be honoured in the world, hee that faithfully keepeth his promises, euen to his owne damage and losse, especially such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises as are confirmed with an oath, hee that auoydeth vsurie and briberie, and whether he lend of curtesie, or iudge of dutie, as led by loue and not by lucre,</hi> hee, hee, whosoeuer he is, rich or poore, learned or simple, high or low, euen he that doth these things, and all these things, and not onely knoweth them and liketh them, but doth them and performes them, and doth them constantly and sincerely, out of loue to God and men, though weakely and vnperfectly, and desireth in the doing of these things to aduance Gods glory, being hartely sorry that he doth these things so faintly and feebly, this is hee that may assure himselfe to be the person that now truely serueth God, and hereafter shall remaine in heauen with him for euer.</p>
