            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Dear Friend,</p>
            <lg>
               <l>I Hear this <hi>Town</hi> does so abound</l>
               <l>With sawcy <hi>Censurcrs,</hi> that faults are found</l>
               <l>Which what of late we (in <hi>Poetique</hi> rage)</l>
               <l>Bestowing, threw away on the dull Age;</l>
               <l>But (howsoe're <hi>Envy,</hi> their spleens may raise,</l>
               <l>To Rob my <hi>Brows</hi> of the deserved <hi>Bays</hi>)</l>
               <l>Their thanks at least I merit, since through me,</l>
               <l>They are partakers of your <hi>Poetry:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And this is all I'le say in my defence,</l>
               <l>T' obtain one Line of your well-worded sense,</l>
               <l>I'd be content t' have writ the <hi>Brittish Prince.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>I'm none of those who think themselves inspir'd;</l>
               <l>Nor write with the vain hope to be admir'd;</l>
               <l>But from a <hi>Rule</hi> I have (upon long tryal)</l>
               <l>T' avoid with care all sort of self denyal.</l>
               <l>Which way so'ere desire, and fancy lead,</l>
               <l>(Contemning <hi>Fame</hi>) that <hi>Path</hi> I boldly tread;</l>
               <l>And if exposing what I take for wit,</l>
               <l>To my dear self a pleasure I beget,</l>
               <l>No matter tho the cens'ring <hi>Criticks</hi> fret.</l>
               <l>These whom my <hi>Muse</hi> displeases, are at strife,</l>
               <l>With equal spleen against my course of life,</l>
               <l>The least delight of which, I'll not forgo,</l>
               <l>For all the flatt'ring praise, <hi>Man</hi> can bestow.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:99919:3"/>
If I design'd to please, the way were then,</l>
               <l>To mend my Manners, rather than my <hi>Pen:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>The first's unnatural, therefore unfit,</l>
               <l>And for the second, I despair of it,</l>
               <l>Since Grace is not so hard to get as Wit.</l>
               <l>Perhaps ill <hi>Verses,</hi> ought to be confin'd</l>
               <l>In meer good breeding like unsav'ry Wind:</l>
               <l>Were reading forc'd, I shou'd be apt to think,</l>
               <l>Men might no more write scurvily than stink:</l>
               <l>But 'tis your choice, whether you'll read, or no,</l>
               <l>If likewise of your smelling it were so.</l>
               <l>I'd Fart just as I write for my own ease,</l>
               <l>Nor shou'd you be concern'd unless you please,</l>
               <l>I'll own, that you write better than I do,</l>
               <l>But I have as much need to write as you.</l>
               <l>What tho the Excrements of my dull <hi>Brain,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Flows in a harsh insipid strain;</l>
               <l>Whilst your rich head, eases it self of Wit.</l>
               <l>Must none but <hi>Civit Cats</hi> have leave to shit?</l>
               <l>In all I write, shou'd Sense, and Wit, and Rhyme,</l>
               <l>Fail me at once, yet something so sublime,</l>
               <l>Shall stamp my <hi>Poem,</hi> that the <hi>World</hi> may see,</l>
               <l>It cou'd have been produc'd by none but me;</l>
               <l>And that's my end, for <hi>Man</hi> can wish no more,</l>
               <l>Than so to write, as none e're writ before.</l>
               <l>Yet why am I no <hi>Poet</hi> of the times?</l>
               <l>I have <hi>Allusions, Similies,</hi> and <hi>Rhymes,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And <hi>Wit,</hi> or else 'tis hard that I alone,</l>
               <l>Of the whole Race of <hi>Mankind</hi> shou'd have none.</l>
               <l>Unequally the partial hand of <hi>Heav'n,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Has all but this one only blessing giv'n.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:99919:3"/>
The <hi>World</hi> appears like a great Family,</l>
               <l>Whose <hi>Lord</hi> opprest with <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Poverty.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>(That to a few great bounty he may show)</l>
               <l>Is fain to starve the num'rous Train below.</l>
               <l>Just so seems <hi>Providence,</hi> as poor, and vain,</l>
               <l>Keeping more Creatures than it can maintain.</l>
               <l>Here 'tis profuse, and there it mainly saves,</l>
               <l>And for one <hi>Prince,</hi> it makes ten thousand <hi>Slaves.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>In Wit, alone't has been Magnificent,</l>
               <l>Of which so just a share to each is sent,</l>
               <l>That the most Avaricious are content.</l>
               <l>For none e're thought (the due divisions such)</l>
               <l>His own too little, or his <hi>Friends</hi> too much.</l>
               <l>Yet most <hi>Men</hi> shew, or find great want of Wit</l>
               <l>Writing themselves, or judging what is writ.</l>
               <l>But I, who am of sprightly vigour full,</l>
               <l>Look on <hi>Mankind,</hi> as envious and dull,</l>
               <l>Born to my self, my self I like alone,</l>
               <l>And must conclude my judgment good, or none.</l>
               <l>For cou'd my sense be naught, how shou'd I know,</l>
               <l>Whether another <hi>Mans</hi> were good or no?</l>
               <l>Thus I resolve of my own <hi>Poetry,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>That 'tis the best, and there's a Fame for me.</l>
               <l>If then I'm happy, what does it advance,</l>
               <l>Whither to merit due, or Arrogance?</l>
               <l>Oh! but the <hi>World</hi> will take offence hereby,</l>
               <l>Why then the <hi>World</hi> shall suffer for't, not I.</l>
               <l>Did e're the sawcy <hi>World,</hi> and I agree</l>
               <l>To let it have its beastly will on me?</l>
               <l>Why shou'd my prostituted sense be drawn,</l>
               <l>To ev'ry Rule their musty Customes spawn?</l>
               <l>

But <hi>Men,</hi> will censure you, 'tis two to one,</l>
               <l>When e're they censure, they'll be in the wrong.</l>
               <l>There's not a thing on Earth, that I can name,</l>
               <l>So foolish, and so false, as common Fame.</l>
               <l>It calls the <hi>Courtier Knave,</hi> the plain <hi>Man</hi> rude,</l>
               <l>Haughty the grave, and the delightful lew'd.</l>
               <l>Impertinent the brisk, Moross the sad,</l>
               <l>Mean the familiar, the reserv'd one mad.</l>
               <l>Poor helpless <hi>Woman,</hi> is not favour'd more,</l>

               <l>When pincht with cold from thence I started;</l>
               <l>Where missing you, I stampt and star'd,</l>

               </l>
               <l>And the slight <hi>Arguments,</hi> she did produce,</l>
               <l>Were not to flatter Vice, but to traduce:</l>

               <l>Not to be gay, but more ridiculous,</l>
               <l>When she a <hi>Hector,</hi> for her <hi>Subject</hi> had,</l>
               <l>She thought she must be <hi>Tarmagant,</hi> and mad;</l>
               <l>That made her speak like a lewd <hi>Punck,</hi> 'oth <hi>Town,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Who by converse with <hi>Bullys,</hi> wicked grown,</l>

               <l>And turns a modest, civil <hi>Girl,</hi> again.</l>
               <l>Our <hi>Poet,</hi> has a diff'rent taste of Wit,</l>
               <l>Nor will to th' common Vogue, himself submit.</l>

               <l>Wits name, was never to profaness due,</l>

               <l>For all <hi>Men,</hi> on that Subject, <hi>Poets</hi> are.</l>
               <l>Henceforth he says, if ever more he find,</l>

               <l>He never means to make his end delight;</l>
               <l>Shou'd he do so, he must despair success,</l>
               <l>For he's not now debauch'd enough to please,</l>
               <l>And must be damn'd for want of wickedness.</l>

               <l>My love, an Off'ing, to your noble <hi>Bed:</hi>

               <l>Since when, y'ave been the <hi>Star,</hi> by which I steer'd</l>
               <l>And nothing else but you, I lov'd, or fear'd.</l>
               <l>Your smiles, I only live by, and I must.</l>
               <l>When e're you frown, be shatter'd into Dust.</l>
               <l>Oh! can the coldness that you shew me now,</l>
               <l>Suit with the gen'rous heart you once did shew?</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:99919:71"/>
I cannot live on pitty, or respect,</l>
               <l>A thought so mean, wou'd my whole love infect;</l>
               <l>Less than your love, I scorn Sir to expect.</l>
               <l>Let me not live in dull indiff'rency,</l>
               <l>But give me rage enough to make me dye!</l>
               <l>For if from you, I needs must meet my Fate,</l>
               <l>Before your pitty, I wou'd choose your hate.</l>

            </head>
            <p>Madam,</p>
            <lg>
               <l>IF your deceiv'd, it is not by my Cheat,</l>
               <l>For all disguises, are below the great.</l>
               <l>What <hi>Man,</hi> or <hi>VVoman,</hi> upon <hi>Earth</hi> can say,</l>
               <l>I ever us'd 'em well above a Day?</l>
               <l>How is it then, that I inconstant am?</l>
               <l>He changes not, who always is the same.</l>
               <l>In my dear self, I center ev'ry thing,</l>
               <l>My <hi>Servants, Friends,</hi> My <hi>Mrs.</hi> and my <hi>King,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Nay Heav'n, and <hi>Earth,</hi> to that one poynt I bring.</l>
               <l>We'll manner'd, honest, generous, and stout,</l>
               <l>Names by dull <hi>Fools,</hi> to plague Mankind found out;</l>
               <l>Shou'd I regard, I must my self constrain,</l>
               <l>And 'tis my <hi>Maxim,</hi> to avoid all pain.</l>
               <l>You fondly look for what none e're cou'd find,</l>
               <l>Deceive your self, and then call me unkind,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:99919:71"/>
And by false Reasons, wou'd my falshood prove,</l>
               <l>For 'tis as natural to change, as love:</l>
               <l>You may as justly at the <hi>Sun,</hi> repine,</l>
               <l>Because alike it does not always shine,</l>
               <l>No glorious thing, was ever made to stay,</l>
               <l>My blazing <hi>Star,</hi> but visits and away.</l>
               <l>As fatal to it shines, as those 'ith' <hi>Skyes,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>'Tis never seen, but some great <hi>Lady</hi> dyes.</l>
               <l>The boasted favor, you so precious hold,</l>
               <l>To me's no more than changing of my Gold</l>
               <l>What e're you gave, I paid you back in Bliss,</l>
               <l>Then wher's the Obligation pray of this?</l>
               <l>If heretofore you found grace in my <hi>Eyes,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Be thankful for it, and let that suffice,</l>
               <l>But <hi>VVoman, Beggar-like,</hi> still haunt the Door,</l>
               <l>Where they've receiv'd a <hi>Charity</hi> before.</l>
               <l>Oh happy <hi>Sultan!</hi> whom we barb'rous call,</l>
               <l>How much refin'd art thou above us all:</l>
               <l>Who envys not the joys of thy <hi>Serail?</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Thee like some <hi>God!</hi> the trembling Crowd adore,</l>
               <l>Each <hi>Man</hi>'s thy <hi>Slave,</hi> and <hi>VVoman kind,</hi> thy <hi>VVhore.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Methinks I see thee underneath the Shade,</l>
               <l>Of Golden Ganopy, supinely laid,</l>
               <l>Thy crowding <hi>Slaves,</hi> all silent as the Night,</l>
               <l>But at thy nod, all active, as the light!</l>
               <l>Secure in solid Sloth, thou there dost reign,</l>
               <l>And feel'st the joys of Love, without the pain.</l>
               <l>Each <hi>Female,</hi> courts thee with a wishing Eye,</l>
               <l>While thou with auful pride, walk'st careless by;</l>
               <l>Till thy kind Pledge, as last, marks out the <hi>Dame,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Thou fancy'st most, to quench thy present flame.</l>

Then from the Bed, submissive she retires.</l>
               <l>And thankful for the grace, no more requires.</l>
               <l>No loud reproach, nor fond unwelcome sound,</l>
               <l>Of <hi>Womens</hi> Tongues, thy sacred Ear does wound;</l>
               <l>If any do, a nimble <hi>Mute,</hi> strait tyes</l>
               <l>The <hi>True-loves-knot,</hi> and stops her foolish cryes.</l>

               <l>Nor Mid-night Ambushes, by <hi>Rivals</hi> laid;</l>
               <l>While here with aking Hearts, our joys we tast,</l>

We stee'rd our Course to <hi>Dragon Green,</hi>

               <l>Which in <hi>Fleet-street</hi> to be seen,</l>
               <l>Where we drank <hi>VVine,</hi> not foul but clean</l>
               <l>Contrary.</l>
               <l>Our <hi>Host</hi> Eclipsed <hi>Thomas Hammon,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Presented slice of <hi>Bacon Gamon,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>VVhich made us swallow <hi>Sack,</hi> as <hi>Salmon</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Does Water.</l>
               <l>Being over warm with the last debauch,</l>
               <l>I grew as drunk as any <hi>Roach,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>VVhen hot Back'd <hi>Wardens</hi> did opproach,</l>
               <l>Or later.</l>
               <l>But see the damn'd confounded fate,</l>
               <l>Attends on drinking <hi>VVine</hi> so late,</l>
               <l>I drew my Sword on honest <hi>Kate</hi>

               <l>VVhich <hi>Hammonds Wife</hi> cou'd not endure,</l>

               <l>From <hi>Bitching</hi>
               </l>
               <l>We broke our Glasses out of hand,</l>
               <l>As many <hi>Oaths,</hi> we did command,</l>
               <l>As <hi>Hastings, Savin, Southerland,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Or <hi>Ogle.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Then I cry'd up <hi>Sir Harry Fain,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And swore by God I wou'd mantain,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> was too plain,</l>
               <l>A juggle.</l>
               <l>And having now discharg'd the <hi>House,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>We did reserve a gentle <hi>Souse,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>With which we drank another <hi>Rouse,</hi>
