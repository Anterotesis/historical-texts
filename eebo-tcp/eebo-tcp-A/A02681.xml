            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <item>2. Whoſoever ſhall take the Scapular of the Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, and dye in the ſame, ſhall never bee da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mned.</item>

            </p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:17038:3"/>
            <p>The firſt of theſe lewde poſitions is taken out of the Chronicle of the Fryar Minors, (for ſo are the Franciſcans called) <hi>tom.</hi> 1. and fathered upon S. <hi>Francis</hi> as one of thoſe Legacyes bequeathed by him unto his Order, and by the Friars of his Order indifferently to be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſo many as ſhall before their death deſire to be put into their habit, which that it may bee the better knowne and notified unto the world, it is commonly printed under the Image of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> and placed at our Altars, as both my ſelfe and many others have beheld with our eyes in this citty.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is recorded in a certaine ſheet of paper, not much unlike unto a Ballad, printed by the Friar Carmelits: The title whereof is, An abridgment of the Priviledges of the holy Scapular granted by the moſt gracious Queene of Heaven, MARY, unto the Order of the Carmelites. In which <hi>Compendium</hi> or Briefe, the inſtitute of the holy Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular (for ſo is it called) is layd downe in theſe words.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Simon Stoc</hi> the ſixt Generall of all the Latines of this Order, did receive not without a manifeſt ſigne of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine favour, this moſt ſacred Scapular; for when as he had along time with much earneſtneſſe beſought of Almighty God, that by ſome manifeſt token it might appeare that the Friar Carmelites were in the vndoubted protection of the bleſſed Virgin, behold vpon a certain night he ſaw the Mother of God in great glory, who reached downe vnto him this divine Scapular with theſe words: <hi>Dilectiſsime fili, hoc recipe tui ordinis ſcapulare, meae confraternitatis ſignu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, tibi, et cunctis Carmelitis privilegium, in quo quis moriens, non aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num patietur incendium.

               </gap>lvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſafety in dangers, a league of peace and an everlaſting covenant &amp;c. If more can be aſcribed unto him who dyed for mankind upon the Altar of the Croſſe, I leave it to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Church to determine. And ſuch was the viſion of S. <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Stoc</hi> exhibited by the Carmelites unto the Eſtate, in the caſtle of Dublin in the moneth of Auguſt 1633. by the hands of <hi>Edmund Doyle</hi> Prieſt. And if any doubt heerof, they ſhall find the very originall with me when ever they ſhall be pleaſed to demaund the ſame. And ſuch is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentication of the Scapular of the Carmelites evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed every-where by the Friars of that Order, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto the eye at many of their altars by tables of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. Now if any deſire to know what thing this Scapular is, and have not ſeene the ſame, behold this deſcription. The Scapular is onely two ſquare pieces of cloath of the bigneſſe of two trenchers, <note place="margin">The ſorme of a Scapu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</note> the one before pendant upon the breſt, the other behind upon the ſhoulders, from whence it hath the name of Scapular.</p>
            <p>The third Propoſition as touching the Saturdayes faſte of <hi>Donna Luiſsa</hi> the Nunn of S. <hi>Clare,</hi> is much inſiſted upon and moſt carefully taught by the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> or <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Friars, and particularly by Friar <hi>Thomas Babe,</hi> who publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame the 29. of Aprill, being the feaſt of S. <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> and S. <hi>Catherin of Siena,</hi> in the yeare of our Lord 1631. in the Cook-ſtreet of <hi>Dublin</hi> in a publicke audience, whoſe exhortation to the people was to this purpoſe. That forſomuch as a certaine holy. Virgin called <hi>Luiſſa</hi> of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of S.<hi>Clare</hi> had a revelation, that whoſoever ſhould faſt upon the next Saturday after they heard of her death, ſhould never dye in mortall ſin, or of any evill death. The aforeſaid Friar <hi>Thomas Babe</hi> perſwaded the people then preſent, to undertake ſo holy a pennance, mooved where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17038:4"/>very many (and I ſay <hi>ſignanter</hi> very many) as they did be loeve his doctrin, ſo did they moſt carefully obſerve the ſame faſte, among whom as chiefe of all the reſt, <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Flemming</hi> aliàs <hi>Barnwell</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Dublin</hi> for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniple unto his flock, and as a prime man of the ſame order obſerved moſt devoutly the ſame, as himſelfe hath not bin aſhamed diverſe times to acknowledge: Neither was that doctrine onely then, but ſundry other times alſo taught by that falſe Apoſtle Friar <hi>Babe</hi> and his fellowes in diverſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of this City and Dioceſſe.</p>
            <p>Moſt holy Father, I meddle not with the matter of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolgences, neither doe I intend, or ever did, to diſcourſe of that argument. I onely complaine of theſe wicked do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines; and I doe adjure your ſanctity, in the Name of the crucified, that you confirme your flock in theſe parts, that they be not led away with theſe new doctrines from that faith in which our holy Mother the Church hath bred us from her breſt. I ſay that we be no longer miſ-led by theſe Mendicants who ſeeke to perſwade us theſe carnall fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes, more ſerviceable I confeſſe unto the belly, then any wayes behoofeful unto the ſoule, but rather as the Apoſtle willeth us, that wee abide in thoſe things which wee have learned, and have beene committed unto us, in no ſort ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting theſe new Apoſtles as ſent from heaven, but rather avoyding them as ſeducers come from hell. For we fooles doe verily beleeve, That he who was borne of the bleſſed and immaculat Virgin God and Man, <hi>Ieſus</hi> and <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> who ſuffered ſo many and ſo grievous torments upon the Croſſe under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> who aroſe glorious from the death, and aſcended into Heaven, that he and no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us from the curſe of the Law, that he and no other hath cleanſed us from our iniquityes, and wrought our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation for us. And that neither <hi>Paul,</hi> nor <hi>Apollo,</hi> nor
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17038:4"/>the habit of S.<hi>Francis,</hi> nor the Scapular of the Carmelites, nor Dame <hi>Luiſſa</hi> the Nun of S.<hi>Clare,</hi> order (be ſhee never ſo holy a woman) hath waſhed us with her bloud, or was crucifyed for us.</p>
            <p>Moſt holy Father, you have given unto us for the Paſtor of our ſoules, a Friar of the Order of S.<hi>Francis,</hi> by name <hi>Thomas Flemming</hi> alias <hi>Barnwell,</hi> conſecrated Archbiſhop of Dublin; to him our Dioceſan were preſented our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains and grievances in the behalfe of the Clergy of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blin, againſt the moſt horrid and blaſphemous tenents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned. I ſay two R. Prieſts in the name of the reſt perſonally appearing before our Archbiſhop, did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him not onely with the names of the delinquents, but a catalogue alſo of their witneſſes and proofes which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on the 7. of March in the yeare 1631. in this Citty of Dublin. But what anſwer received the two Prieſts from their Ordinary? Truely none at all, neither to this day have they profited in that ſuit. For verily it is to be feared that this diſeaſe (whoſe nature is to fret like a canker) hath invaded and infected the head no leſſe then the reſt of the body. And we are the rather enduced to beleeve the ſame, for that we ſee theſe errors and corrupt doctrines day lie more and more to prevaile, &amp; to enlarge themſelves eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially among the ignorant and common people, alas too eaſie and flexible to be led aſtray: for there are a number of Regulars, eſpecially of the Franciſcans and Carmelites, falſe Apoſtles, who not onely in pulpits preach theſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, but as the Apoſtle ſayth, <hi>going from houſe to houſe, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert whole familyes, teaching what they ought not for filthy lucres ſake.</hi> For no ſmall profit doubtleſſe doth ariſe unto theſe Poets and Inventours of fable, inſomuch as they may truely ſay with <hi>Demetrius</hi> the ſilver-ſmyth, <hi>Act. 19. De hoc artificio nobis eſt acquiſitio:</hi> Sirs you know that our gaine
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17038:5"/>is of this occupation. For (ſay mee) who in the world is there that beleeves any thing to remaine after death and aſhes, who will not be glad to avoy de the paines of hell? who deſires not to enjoy a bleſſed eternity in Heaven? And I call Heaven and Earth to witneſſe, what thing is there more eaſiethen before death to creepe into a Friars habit? or what more tollerable then to faſt one day, which is no more then having one competent repaſt at noone, to for beare a ſupper at night? Or what is there leſſe trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome then to carry two ſquare pannicles or clouts, the one upon his back, the other at his boſome, under his garments (I wis) a carriage not ſo burdenſome, nor comparably ſo painfull, as was that heavy became of the Croſſe which ſweet In svs carryed upon his backe to mount Calvary, and on which the ſalvation of the world did hang. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe if future glory in the world to come, &amp; the aſſurance thereof in this life might with ſo ſmall a labour be purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, who is ſo much an <hi>Euclio</hi> or ſtreit handed?

Or what woman carefull of her ſoules health, will make ſpare of whatſoever is in her cuſtody or under her hands? her bracelets, her rings, chaynes, Iewels, her cheſts of linnen, her arkes of meale and malt in exchange of ſuch immortall benefits, and to have ſo propitious and preſent gods, albeit our Saviour hath ſaid: <hi>Quid commutationis ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo dabit pro anima ſua?

And what are the fruits ſweet Ieſus) of theſe falſo prophets among us at this day, but to make the gates of Heaven to gape as wide as the gates of hell it ſelfe. For albeit the Apoſtle hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from celeſtiall glory not a few, ſaying, <hi>Hoc enim ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tote intelligentes &amp;c.</hi> For underſtanding know this, that no fornicator, nor uncleane or covetousiperſon, which is the fervice of Idols, hath inheritance in the Kingdome of Chriſt and of God: yet will our Friars admin them all, if they once faſte Dame <hi>Luiſſaes</hi> ſaturdayes faſte. And albeit Chriſt our Lord excluded the man who had not a wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding garment from his Kingdome, yet will the Franciſcan Friar let in any who is cloathed with his habit, and ſo the Carmelite ſuch as are found with his Scapular about their ſhoulders. I ſay, all theſe ſo qualifved ſhall be accepted of, and be admitted as well unto the Dinner of the great King as unto the Supper of the Lambe. Who then can marvell (theſe doctrines ſuppoſed as orthodox, yea as oracles) that we day lie ſee ſo many to be buryed in Friars weeds, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men &amp; women day lie to take the Scapular, witneſſe the regiſter of the Friars Franciſcan and Carmelices, in which their names are carefully recorded, as perpetuall Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors unto their Orders. Nay, who is there eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Laity <hi>(O triſte verbum!)</hi> who dare ſo nurch truſt to the ſufferings of our Saviour, and to the merites of his death &amp; paſſion, as they dare be found in the houre of death without that thrice holy Scapular, that ſigne of ſalvarion,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17038:6"/>that ſafety in dangers, that league of peace, &amp; of aneverla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting covenant, in which who ſo dyeth, ſhall never ſuffer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall fire. All which attributions are incorporated unto the ſaid Scapular by the bleſſed Virgin, if <hi>Simon Stoc</hi> his revelation be authenticke; yea many among us nor truſting to the habit alone, or unto the Scapular alone, or to the Nunnes faſte alone, will before their death beee furniſhed with them all three together, having wiſely underſtood that of <hi>Salomon, Proverh. 4. Funiculus triplex difficile rumpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur:</hi> A triple cord is not eaſily broken. In which their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding me ſeemeth that yet they ſhew ſome weakenes of faith; for if they did conſtantly beleeve every one of theſe three promiſed ſalvations to be aſſured by divine revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as their teachers be are them in hand, ſurely either any of them is ſufficient, or all of them together inſufficient.</p>
            <p>Neither doth it boot the Friars to cloake theſe their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors by ſaying, That theſe doctrines rightly underſtood, do not import every ſinner by keeping ſuch a faſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, by taking ſuch an Habit, or Scapular to be favied, but ſuch onely as be contrite with all for their fins, and are waſhed in the blood of the Redeemer. For neither doe our Friars, in their Semons and exhortations, mention any ſuch condition, &amp;c if they did, yet notwithſtanding the whoſe doctrine of the Sabbaoth faſte, the Habit &amp; the Scapular, (no leſſeblazed by the Friars, then ſuperſtitouſly beleeved of the people) would utterly vaniſh into ſmoake. For why? a perſon ſo diſpoſed and qualifyed, that is penitent for his fimes, and relying upon the redemption of In sas CHRIST is apt for the Kingdome of God, and to receive an inheritance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Saints and Elect, ſay he be naked of Habit &amp; ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular, and not at all acquainted with <hi>Donna Luiſſa</hi> her ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turdayes faſt: yea a man ending his dayes in the ſervice of God, and as the Divines ſay in the eſtate of grace can not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17038:6"/>miſſe of his ſalvation, had he but a couple of Hawkes-bells about his neck, or if he dyed in his old bootes as well as in ſcapular or habit. If then the Friar thus expounds himſelf. He that dyeth in the habit or ſcapular, ſhall undoubredly be ſaved, alwayes provided that he bein the love and favor of God, verily he might as wel have ſpared ſo much breath to have cooled his broth, I ſay, as to ſpend it upon ſuch a gloſſe as corrupteth and quite over-throweth the text. No no, <hi>Mors in olla,</hi> There is poyſon in the pot. For theſe prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers deſire no thing leſſe then to be ſo underſtood in their ſermons when they make their Panegyricks of the habit and ſcapular unto the people, for by that meanes they might be in danger not onely to looſe their offerings at the Altar, but that great authority and place which they have in the hearts and affection of the Laity. No rather with all poſſible endeavour they labour to bee beleeved, that by the vertue of theſe raggs, either as cauſes inſtrumentall or infallible ſignes, ſalvation is to be acquired. And heuce it is that the Carmelite Friars dedicate yeerely a day of great feſtivity, namely the 16. of Iuly. unto the honour and rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the Scapular, as the Franciſcans alſo doe to that parcell of their habit which is the Cord or Girdle. Ar which feſtival times it is lamentable to behold how much the Divine Majeſtie by theſe beggars &amp; their devotoes is prophaned in his creatures:yea truly the world might leſſe admire in theſe diſmall dayes the Sun to be eclipſed, &amp; the rocks to rent, then at the time of our Saviours paſſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the benefit thereof ſo miſerably defaced by theſe falſe Teachers who in theſe dayes cannot be contented to rob the people of their purſes, but of their ſoules alſo.</p>
            <p>And to the end, they and all thoſe that read theſe my writings may underſtand, that I will not inveigh without juſt cauſe or reprove in words what I am not able by good
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17038:7"/>Argument to confound: I ſeriouſly demaund of our Friar, what ground they have either from the divine Oracles, Eccleſiaſticall tradition, or monuments of the Fathers, to promiſe this ſecurity and certitude of Salvation, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine of the Sons of Adam in particular and by polle that their names are written in the booke of life. I ſay, while yet we are <hi>viatotes, et non in ſtatu,</hi> Pilgrimes from our Lord, and not arrived at our country. I heare <hi>Salomon</hi> one of the Secretaries of the Holy Ghoſt ſaying, <hi>Prov. 20. Quis poteſt dicere mundum eſt cor meum?</hi> Who can ſay my heart is cleane? I heare <hi>Iob</hi> ſaying, <hi>Etiamſi ſimplex fuero, &amp;c. Job. 9.</hi> Albeit I be innocent, yet ſhall my ſoule bee igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant thereof. I heare the Apoſtle ſaying, <hi>Philip. 2. Cum me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta &amp; tremore veſtram ſalutem operamini.</hi> Worke your Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with feare and trembling. I heare S. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> upon the 40. <hi>Pſal.</hi> ſaying, <hi>Scia quod justitia Dei mei maneat, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum an juſtitia mea maneat an non, ignoro, terret me enim Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolus inquiens. Qui exiſtimat ſe stare, videat ne cadat.</hi> I know that the juſtice of my God remaines, but whether my ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice doe remaine or not, I am ignorant. For the Apoſtle doth terrify me ſaying, he who thinkes he ſtands, let him looke to it he fall not. So S. <hi>Hierome</hi> in his 3. booke upon the Prophet <hi>Ieremy.</hi> Man ſeeth in the face, God in the heart, and that which unto us doth ſome times ſeeme cleane, in Gods eyes is found filthy. Adde hereunto the teſtimony of S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in his 5. Sermon upon the 118. <hi>Pſal.</hi> S. <hi>Chryſoſt Homil. 87.</hi> upon <hi>Iohn.</hi> S. <hi>Gregory lib. 6. epiſt: 22.</hi> S. <hi>Bede</hi> in his Comment. upon the 20. cap. of the <hi>Prov.</hi> But I may not ommit to ſet downe at large what S. <hi>Bernard</hi> that pillar of Gods Church in theſe later Centuryes hath left written of this argument, as in many other places, ſo eſpecially in his 1. Sermon <hi>de Septuageſima</hi> in theſe words; Who can ſay I am one of the Elect? I am one of thoſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:17038:7"/>that are predeſtinated unto life: I am one of the children of God? Who, I ſay, can ſay this? When as the Scripture cryeth out againſt him. Man knoweth not whether he be worthy of love or hatred. Certainely therefore wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have, but yet we are comforred with the truſt of hope, that we may not by anxiety of this dubitation be tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above meaſure. So he. Laſtly to this cloud of teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies out of the ancient fathers, I will adde the uniforme conſent of the moderne Fathers of the Councell of Trent, condemning &amp; anathematizing this certitude of Salvation <hi>Can. 15.</hi> in theſe words. <hi>Si quis dixerit hominem renatum &amp; juſtificatum teneri ex ſide ad credendum ſe certo eſſe in numero praedeſlinatorum Anathem aſit.</hi> If any ſhall ſay a man regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and juſtifyed to be bound by faith to beleeve himſelf undoubtedly to be in the number of the predeſtinate, let him be accurſed: and in the <hi>Can.</hi> following, <hi>Si quis mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num illud uſque in finem perſeverantiae donum ſe certo habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, abſoluta &amp; infallibili certitudine dixerit niſi hoc exſpeciali revelatione didicerit) anathema ſit.</hi> If any ſhall ſay, that by abſolute and infallible aſſurance he hath that great gift of perſeverance unto the end, unleſſe he hath learned the ſame by ſpeciall revelation, accurſed be he. So the Councell.</p>
            <p>And ſure no marvaile. Since this preſumption of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the very food and fewell of all wickedneſſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, the provocation and incitement to all ſhameleſſe luſts and pleaſures, with which the ſoule once poſſeſſed what further care is to be taken in matters of conſcience: For ſay, That now I have either gotten the habit of the Franciſcans upon my backe, or the Scapular of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melites hanging about my necke, (a moſt preſent antidote againſt hell and damnation) what have I henceforth to doe with the commandements of God and Holy C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

I ſay what cauſe have I further to wage warre with vice, or longer to reſiſt the ſweete allurements of Evill. Yea what ſhould hinder me to ſay with <hi>Salomon</hi> (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving run the ſame courſes with him) <hi>Eccleſ. 2.

            </p>
            <p>Theſe be the thoughts, theſe the labours of the minde, theſe the diſcourſes of the underſtanding which doe often burſt out into the lipps and tongues of men entangled in theſe intricacyes of error. And what <hi>Moſes</hi> have wee among us to put himſelfe as a wall and a bulwarke for the houſe of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> Who ſhall paciſie theſe congregations of <hi>Abiram?</hi> Who ſhall conſume and burne up this new fire of the ſonnes of <hi>Aaron</hi> with a better flame? Where is <hi>Elias,</hi> or where is <hi>Micheas</hi> to reprove theſe falſe Prophets, of pleaſing but perilous lyes. Where is that Apoſtle of Chriſt? Who ſhould confound theſe falſe Apoſtles with an Apoſtolicall zeale? Scarſe is there one <hi>Peter</hi> to be found among us to oppoſe himſelfe to theſe <hi>Simons.</hi> Scarſe one <hi>Paul</hi> to deliver up theſe <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexanders</hi> unto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, that they may learne not to blaſpheme. For tell mee, who is there among the Clergy, at leaſt in this our Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne Iland, divided from the reſt of the world, that is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther willing or able to goe againſt theſe Regulars, moving ſo irregularly out of their owne proper ſpheares? Nay rather, who is there among us not carryed head-long by theſe their raptand violent motions, into the aforeſaid er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors? If not in expreſſe termes of approbation, at leaſt by a ſhut up cye, and a ſealed lip, of a ſilent connivance?

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17038:8"/>drawne to a farre more penicious diſſimulation then was that of <hi>Barnabas</hi> condemned by the Apoſtle. For albeit the Prieſts of the Clergy in theſe parts are leſſe refractary unto Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline, yea truely farre more obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient unto the lawes and beheſts of holy Church then the Regulars, yet not much more learned I confeſſe, and in number farre inferiour unto them, as may be ſeene in this principall Citty of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in which there be onely ſix pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, but of Regulars not much ſewer then a hundred, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit by reaſon of their ebbing and flowing, their frequent excurſions cauſed by their manifold negotiations in every corner of the Kingdome, their out-gates beyond the ſeas, and back againe returnes, it is as hard to deſine what num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber they be of, as to count how many froggs there were in the ſecond plague of Egypt, yea to ſuch a potency they are growne, and that in a ſhort ſpace in this Kingdome of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that what cauſe ſoever they take in hand, be it juſt or injuſt, Eccleſiaſticall or Temporall, they will, nay they muſt be Conquerours; ſo united among themſelves, ſo backt with powerfull friendſhips, ſo animated with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine correſpondencyes, not to ſpeake of ordinary conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinityes and affinityes, foſter-ſhips, and goſſip-fhips, ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayled not onely to the Commons, but unto the greateſt Familyes, by taking in of Youths into their Convents, May des into their Cloyſters, furniſhing Merchants with cuſtome, purchaſers with moneyes upon morgages &amp; rent charges, abſolurely ruling in all matters of Contracts and matrimoniall cauſes, managing the aſſay res of rich Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, but ſeldom (I confeſſe) helping them to husbands. <note n="*" place="margin">

(though we could not beleeve them) yet ſhould wee not dare to gainſay them, or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt with them.</p>
            <p>For as it is the nature of plenty to beget proſperity, and this, pride, ſo our Regulars at this day are arrived at ſuch an unmeaſurable greatneſſe, through plenty and popular eſtimation, as they are not onely a terrour unto the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Paſtors of Gods Church, but even unto Biſhops and Cardinals. Nor will I except thee O Pope <hi>Vrbanus!</hi> who not once (as we are credibly informed from the city) haſt complayned of their inſupportable pride and inſolencies, ſaying to ſuch as complayned of their injuryes: I marveil not that they wrong you, for they wrong my ſelfe. And as theſe Regulars are awfull unto the Clergy, ſo no leſſe fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are they unto the Laity, who therefore yeeld them ſuch attribution, as either they hope their friendſhip to bee an advantage unto them in the proſequution of their ends, or they providently fore-ſee how much the malice of a powerfull enemy may bee prejudiciall unto them in the ſame kinde. So as be who thou wilt, friend or foe, the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar will benefit himſelfe by thee.

Forſomuch then as theſe ſupernaturall prerogatives aſcribed unto the <hi>Hubit, Seapular,</hi> and <hi>Donna Luiſſa</hi> her faſt, are all of them built upon viſions and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and we are taught by the holy Ghoſt from the mouth of the Apoſtle, 2. Cor. 11. <hi>That Satan can tranſfigure himſelfe into an Angell of light,</hi> and therefore are admoniſhed by the ſame Apoſtle not to be circumvented by him, <hi>whoſe operation conſisteth in all power and lying ſignes and wonders, and in all ſedmong of Iniquity.</hi> I demaund then of you O Regulars, and eſpecially of you Gray Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars and <hi>Carmelites,</hi> how you come to know, that forſomuch as <hi>S. Fraugis,</hi> and <hi>S.

For ſay, that <hi>S. Francis,</hi> and <hi>S. Simon Stec</hi> be canonized Saints, yet not all that is written by them, or of them is canonized truths. And therefore as wicked men and women in the Scriptures have beene honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with divine viſions, and revelations, as <hi>Balaam, Pharaoh, Saul, Nebuch aduczar, Pelats</hi> wife, and the <hi>Sybills,</hi> ſo have many of Gods ſervants beene deceived by ſtrong illuſions to beleeve lyes.

Nay S. <hi>Francis</hi> himſelfe ſeemes not to have beene priviledged in this kind, I ſay, from being abuſed with falſe revelations. For as wee reade in the Chronicle of the Friar <hi>Minors:</hi> He having under him a Vicar generall whoſe name was <hi>Helias.</hi> It was revealed unto him by Almighty God, that the aforeſaid Friar ſhould both dye out of the Order, and be damned, in reſpect whereof the holy Faaher S.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17038:12"/>
                  <hi>Francis</hi> did ever after ſo diſ affect the aforeſaid Fryar, that he could not endure to behold him. Yet not many linesafter in the very ſame <hi>sap.</hi> it is reported how the ſame S. <hi>Francis</hi> had a revelation from heaven, that the aforeſaid Friar <hi>Helias</hi> ſhould doe pennance for his ſinnes, and not be damned at all. This ſhall you reade in the Chronicle of the Friar <hi>Minors,</hi> tom. 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 118. And ſuch as will take paines to peruſe S. <hi>Brigids</hi> revelations, &amp; conſerre them with our legends of Saints lives, ſhall finde innumerable examples of like kind. One Saint having a revelation directly contrary to what hath beene revealed unto another. Notwithſtanding that there is but one God, one truth. And we may be enduced or rather enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to beleeve, that theſe revelations, viſions, and apparitions of <hi>S. Francis,</hi> and <hi>Simon Stoc</hi> (if any ſuch were) were meere ſatanicall illuſions, &amp; no divine revelations, for that they promiſe that certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and aſſurance of ſalvation in this life, which is repugnant to ſacred Writt, the uniforme conſent of the Primitive Fathers, the uniforme conſent of Generall Councells, and the beliefe both of our holy Mother the Church, and all her obedient children even unto theſe times, as I have aboundantly proved in my Epiſtle to Pope <hi>Vrbanns,</hi> and not neceſſary heere to be repeated againe. And therefore I will conclude this firſt point with that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Golat.</hi> 1. That if an Angell from heaven ſhall come and preach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us contrary to what we have received, <hi>Anathema ſir.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet to give ſcope to a more full and ample diſcourſe of this Argument, let us admit for the preſent that S. <hi>Francis,</hi> and <hi>Simon Stoc</hi> had received by divine revelation: That whoſoever ſhall dye in the habit of the one, and the ſcapular of the other, ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly be ſaved, (for it may not bee denyed but ſuch certitude may be had by divine revelation) Examples we have of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures of the two glorious Apoſtles, S. <hi>Peter</hi> &amp; S. <hi>Paul,</hi> of S. <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> &amp; ſome others, for the arme of our Lord is not ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, nor his power abridged. Yet (ſay I) conformable to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of holy Church (as afterward ſhall bee prooved) that this can be no aſſurance, or ſecurity unto others, who are not partakers of the ſaid viſions, and revelations to beleeve that doctrine; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe what is of divine authority unto one, is but of humane and ſallible authority unto another. For ſay that <hi>Peter</hi> knoweth a thing
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17038:13"/>to come by certaine &amp; divine revelation, yet the ſame ſhall be to <hi>Patrick</hi> but onely a humane relation, received from the lips of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> a mortall man, ſubject to error and miſtaking, to deceive, and to be deceived, and being but <hi>in via, &amp; non in termine,</hi> peccable in thought, word and deed: and therefore we ſee the Church (whoſe wiſdome is from the holy Ghoſt) never to canonize any perſon, though reputed never ſo holy, while they are in the fleſh, and till ſuch time as their ſanctity be atteſted by ſignes, and wonders from heaven. As then S. <hi>Francis</hi> before his converſion was of life &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation like unto others of his rank, &amp; quality, &amp; not much ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous of the offence of God, till he came unto the age of twenty five, as may appeare both by the firſt words of his Teſtament. <hi>Quia cùm eſſem in peccatis &amp;c.</hi> as alſo by his life written by <hi>Bona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniure.</hi> So albeit I confeſſe the a<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and better part of his life, after his converſion, &amp; dedicating himſelfe unto the ſervice of God, was as a threed more evenly ipun, then the former, yet not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without ſome knotes, as may be knowne by his own confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, when on a time ſo journing in the pallace of the Cardinall <hi>De S<hi rend="sup">ta</hi> Cruce</hi> and in the night-time being beaten of the Devills, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payred in the morning to the preſence of the aforeſaid <hi>Cardinall,</hi> to whom he related what he had endured, and then added, <hi>Men that know me not, repute me as a Saint, but behold how the devills who know me well, doe handle and chastice me for my ſinnes.</hi> So he. <hi>Chron, fras, minor, toni, I, cap.</hi> 13. Out of all which I doe inferre, that a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or revclation is not therefore authenticall, or to be believed, becauſe ſuch a perſon, who after <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now future glory in Heaven being a ſupernaturall object, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by humane knowledge or morall certitude be aſſured unto us, but either not all, or by divine faith, which though not cleare and evident, yet excelleth in certitude and infallibility all ſcientificall knowledge whatſoever. And this <hi>I</hi> ſay to anſwere thoſe who happily in defence of their errors, in the aforeſaid revelations, will ſay, that albeit indeed they be not to be believed by a divine and a ſupernaturall faith, yet may they be certaine unto us, <hi>exáio tapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi> that is, from ſome other topicall argument, which in truth is as much, as if they ſaid nothing, preaching an infallibility of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid viſions, and revelations, then brought unto cheir juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they anſwere us with nothing but hiſtoricall legends (and <hi>I</hi> pray God not rather fabulous) and meere humane poſſibilityes.

Sacraments of the Catholicke Church are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſignes, yet not baſe, &amp; naked, but withall <hi>operative,</hi> that is as ſecondary &amp; inſtrumentall cauſes working that grace which they ſignifie, and ſignifying that grace which they worke. The <hi>habit</hi> &amp; the <hi>ſcapular</hi> (will theſe men ſay) are ſignes of another kind onely foreſhewing &amp; ſignifying beforeha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that happines &amp; glory which ſhal befal al ſuch as ſhalbe fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in the houre of death inveſted with them, albeit they no way concurre to the production of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid glory, either by ſupernatural, phyſicall, or morall influx.

               <p>And I pray God, That many among us, who would bee eſteemed very good &amp; perfect Chriſtians, yeeld not more honour unto the creatures (albeit they make them not their gods) then they ought, or may ſtand with the integrity of our holy faith.</p>
               <p>But to returne to our Argument: (For I purpoſe to leave no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>pro,</hi> or <hi>contra</hi> indiſcuſſed, which may ſerve to diſcover the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of theſe aforeſaid Revelations, with which ſo many ſoules both have beene, and are at this day abuſed.) And firſt for that Legacy of <hi>S. Francis,</hi> grounded upon a viſion, or Revelation. That whoſoever dyeth in his <hi>habit,</hi> ſhall never be prevented with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy death. I perſwade my ſelfe, beſides what already hath been ſaid, that it is a meere fiction &amp; an lmpoſture of his Friars of later times, untruly fathered upon the Saint, for the maintenance of their bellyes.</p>
               <p>And firſt it is held as moſt probable, That <hi>S. Francis</hi> had no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine or particular habit at all, either of this or that cloath, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: but onely courſe and of ſmall price, ſuch as might beſt ſort with poverty, &amp; pennance, as may appeare by his rule <hi>cap.</hi> 2. in theſe words, <hi>Fratres omnes veſtimentis vilibus induantur, &amp; poſſint eis repeciare de ſaccis &amp; alijs pecijs cum benedictione Dei.</hi> Let all the Fryars be clad with courſe clothing, &amp; they may patch them with ſackcloth, &amp; other patches on Gods bleſſing. And this which our Friars doe hold to be a precept of the rule, or equipollent to a precept, may ſeeme to be confirmed by the practice of the Order, for ſee wee not the <hi>Capuchins</hi> to weare a diſtinct habit from the <hi>Cordeliers,</hi> agreeing in nothing but onely in colour? The <hi>Capuchin</hi> having a large friſe coat to the foot, with a piece of courſe canvas ſquare, one halfe yard upon the back, girded unto him with a rude maſſie rope, with a great knot before, &amp; unto this coat ſowed a ſteepled hood, or ca puch, from whence they have the name of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puchins,</hi> of well-neere two foot long, from the <hi>baſis</hi> to the <hi>conus,</hi> &amp; over this coat they have a cloake of the ſame friſe, comming litle below the waſte.</p>
               <p>When as the <hi>Cordelier</hi> profeſſing the ſame Order of <hi>S. Francis,</hi> &amp; the ſame rule, hath a coat of much better friſe, without that ſquare canvas on the back, with a hood or a capuch not ſteepled at all, but round, &amp; fitted unto his head, a girdle of a cord, from whence hee
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:17038:17"/>hath his name of <hi>Cordilier,</hi> the ſame handſomely wrought with many artificiall knots, orderly placed by equall diſtances, a ſleeve, O heavenly wide, which beſides the arme will well containe a couple of Cheeſes quartered, or a Gamon of bacon a-piece, or as many Puddings as would well neere ſerve a whole Convent of Friars for their break-faſt, &amp; over all this they have a cloak of the ſame friſe deſcending almoſt unto the foot. Obſerve then how different theſe habits be, &amp; yet thoſe <hi>Franciſcans</hi> againe which are of the reformation of S. <hi>Diego,</hi> they have a diſtinct habit both from the <hi>Capuchin</hi> &amp; <hi>Cordelier.</hi> Sith then each of theſe deny the other to have the habit of <hi>S. Francis,</hi> I then demaund of our Friars, which of theſe habits? or is it all of them that hath the bleſſing, that whoſoever dyes in them ſhall never be prevented with an unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py death? But what was the true habit of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> or which of the reformations have got it, I make account they will agree u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it when my fingers grow all of one length, &amp; then happily my ſelfe will be as credulous as others to believe them.</p>
               <p>Now againe it is to be obſerved, That this revelation of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit is not to be found in the life of S. <hi>Francis</hi> at all, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his life was written by many &amp; moſt of them of his own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily &amp; order, as firſt &amp; ſoone after his death by <hi>S. Bonaventure,</hi> neither is it in the Bull of his canonization of Pope <hi>Greg. 9.</hi> nor yet in the Roman Breviary or any other Legend of later time, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Lippolo,</hi> or <hi>Lippomannus,</hi> or <hi>Villiegas,</hi> or laſt of all by Friar <hi>Luke Wadding,</hi> a Cordilier, living this day in <hi>Rome.</hi> In all which Legends of the aforeſaid authors, matters of farre leſſe couſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence (I wis) are not forgotten, &amp; yet not word of this great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the <hi>habit</hi> to be read in them.</p>
               <p>Beſides, is it not a thing to be admired &amp; wondered at, that S. <hi>Francis</hi> leaving ſuch a golden legacy unto the world, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever dyed in the habit of his order ſhould be ſaved, that himſelfe was not carefull to dye in the ſame, as well for example unto po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, as alſo to be partaker of that ſecurity of ſalvation with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſtians. For we reade in the firſt tome of the Chronicle of the Priars Minors, <hi>cap.</hi> 71. That <hi>S.

               <p>Laſtly, how can this aforeſaid revelation of the <hi>habit</hi> ſtand with any truth, or probability, when as dayly experience condem <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But ſetting all theſe aſide, which for mine own part, as I doe not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reject, depriving them of all credit &amp; authority. So neither is my faith ſo ſtrong, as to admit into my Creed very much of what I read of that kind. Conſidering that if the belly hath in all times bin a great Maſter of Art, according to that of the Poet, <hi>Venter ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter artis, ingenijque largitor:</hi> The belly is a Maſter of Art, &amp; a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyer of Invention.

               <p>Omitting then all Viſions, Revelations, &amp; Apparitions. I heare our Saviour ſaying, that there is <hi>Spiritus blasphemia,</hi> there is a ſin

               <p>Now then to conclude this Chap. with are capirulation of ſuch argunents, as have bin alledged in the precedent diſcourſe, againſt
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17038:20"/>the doctrine of certaintie of ſalvation by <hi>Habits, Scapulars,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Luiſſian</hi> faſt. Firſt then (gentle reader) thou haſt ſcene the ſame refuted <hi>à priore</hi> from authority of the Church, Scriptures, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, &amp; Fathers.

And therefore that doctrine of theirs muſt needes remaine voyde of all truth. That whoſoever dyes in their habit, ſhall never be prevented with an unhappy death.</p>
               <p>And yet theſe be our Apoſtles, &amp; Miſſionaryes ſent from <hi>Rome</hi> to convert Nations, and to reduce them to the Catholick faith.

You Mendicants enter heere among us, with ſpecious &amp; glorious titles of Legantine, &amp; Miſſionary power. You tell us, you are ſent to labour in the Vineyard, to worke in the harveſt, but what ſayes the Proteſtant? when he ſees all you labour is but to eat the grapes, &amp; to cull out the beſt ſheaves, when they finde all your preaching turned into begging, or at leaſt there unto tending.

O how well it becomes the <hi>Franciſean</hi> &amp; the <hi>Dominican,</hi> after they have ſhamed the poore people on a Sunday morning out of their meanes, the weeke after to gadd thorough the Pariſhes, &amp; to gather in their muttons, and hearde them together.</p>

Gentlemen expecting when the Friars ſheep paſſe by, or where they keepe the market, hoping what they got ſo eaſily, they will not rate too highly. And as dextrous as they be in bringing home the ſtrayed ſheep, ſo no leſſe diligent are they in ſeeking the loſt groat. It is a laudable cuſtome of the Church commanded by expreſſe Canons, that all Chriſtians ſhould communicate at leaſt once a yeare, &amp; the ſame at Eaſter at the hands of their owne Paſtor, &amp; this is called the Paſchall Communion, at which time as by the precept of holy Church, all that are come to the yeares of diſcretion doe partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the bleſſed body &amp; blood of our Saviour in the holy Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, ſo commonly doth every one according to their devotion &amp; ability, make their offering: which offering the good people in this Countrey commonly lay downe upon the Altar, &amp; it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the chiefe maintenance that the Paſtor hath for all the yeare after. But thinke you this poore groat can eſcape the Friars gripe No, for now the holy weeke approaching, the Friar Limitour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ftirs himſelfe, &amp; the weeke commonly before, &amp; after Eaſter, hee viſits all the Pariſhes of his limits, &amp; he either addreſſes himſelfe unto the Oratory of the Pariſh Prieſt, or elſe himſelf makes a <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Neither dare the Pariſh Prieſt conteſt with him, for the Friar is not unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of his friends, who will make good all his pretentions, ſo as if the Prieſt give but the leaſt oppoſition, hee ſhall not onely not
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:17038:21"/>prevayle, but he ſhall have the frowne of the beſt of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh happily all the yeare after. And thus the groat loſt by the Prieſt, is found by the Friar, &amp; where was it all this while, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Altar, cloſe by the Candleſtick. This is that good aſſiſtance, &amp; this the help which the Pariſh Prieſt at Eaſter gets by the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars induſtry, who having found the groat, returnes home, &amp; there rejoyeeth with his fellowes, who in other Pariſhes have done the like ſervice, putting the ſurplus of their gettings into the hands of their <hi>ſyndieus</hi> or Treaſurer (of which every Convent hath one) and I pray God ſuch Treaſures be reſerved for good purpoſes.</p>

               <p>The Pariſhioner may reaſonably judge, that as concerning due &amp; profitable pennance to be enjoyned him for his ſins, the Paſtor or Pariſh prieſt is a judge leſſe to be ſuſpected, &amp; more indifferent then the Friar. For that the penitent cannot ſuſpect, nor hath any, ground to imagine, that his Paſtor by hearing his confeſſion doth expect any temporall lucre, or profit unto himſelfe, for ſo much as all things neceſſary for his maintenance according to the Law of God, &amp; holy Church, are annexed unto his office, But as for the Friars it is not ſo, becauſe as in that appellation which they made againſt me in <hi>England,</hi> it is contayned according unto their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, as they avouch, that not withſtanding they are priviledged to heare the confeſſions of all ſuch as wil confeſſe unto them, they are bound to moſt ſtrict poverty, &amp; begging, whereupon the Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioner may probably ſuſpect, that verily the hope of gaine, &amp; of the relieving of his poverty, is the cauſe why the Friar heares his confeſſion, &amp; thus he may reaſon with himſelf in his mind. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould that beggar that ſits there, heare my confeſſion? &amp; ſo defiſt from ſeeking things neceſſary for his maintenance, unleſſe he expected from me ſuch a ſupply? And forſomuch as poverty is a motive to ſin, by meanes where of his want may be ſupplyed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of <hi>Solomon, Prov. 30. Poverty and riches give me not, but onely ſo much as ſhall be neceſſary for my maintenance, leſt happily being full I may be emiſed to deny thee, &amp; to ſay, who is the Lord? and forced by poverty ſhould ſteale and forſwe are the name of my God.</hi> It followeth that forevery kind of ſin, the Friar will impoſe upon, me almes-deedes, by which his poverty may be relieved, &amp; ſo ſhall not I be ſpiritually cured. For our Saviour, when as his Diſciples asked him: Why could not we caſt him out I (ſpeaking of the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:17038:24"/>devill) he anſwered: <hi>This kinde of devill is not throwne out but by prayer and fasting,</hi> Math. 17. Whereupon it is inferred, that as to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very corporal diſeaſe, a particular medicine is to be applyed, which kind of medicine that beggar attending onely his neceſſityes (as I may well think) will never miniſter unto me. And this reaſon is thus confirmed. For that it ſufficiently appeares, that ſince the Friars have obtained a priviledge of hearing confeſſions every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where thorough the world they have builded beautifull Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and Princely Pallaces. The cauſe whereof ſeemeth to be their grant of hearing Confeſsions: for that before ſuch power given unto them, they were not able to build ſuch houſes. Again it is never heard, that tho Friars either for building of bridges, or repayring of high-wayes, or Pariſh Churches, doe enjoyne almes upon their penitents. Neither doe the Friar <hi>Minors</hi> impoſe almes to be beſtowed upon the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> nor the <hi>Dominicans</hi> upon the <hi>Minors.</hi> Every one applying all unto themſelves &amp; unto their owne order. Wherefore it may be probably judged, that private lucce &amp; gaine is the cauſe why ſuch a begging Friar is ſo careful to heare the confeſſion of the Layman, that he neglects his time of begging, &amp;c.

Or he that is not typed to any cure, or charge, &amp; not having any obligation, may retire himſelf from thoſe afflicted places, may forſake his countrey, the place of his abode, &amp; live where he likes beſt, yea &amp; who peradventure may think with himſelfe, that it is but to tempt God, to expoſe himſelfe raſhly to the hazard of his life without any neceſſary obligation, according as it is written, <hi>Qui amat periculum, peribit in illo.</hi> He who loveth danger, ſhall periſh therein. Let us now put the laſt finger to this Evangelicall deſcription of a Shepheard, and of an hireling. The mercenary or hireling (ſayth S. <hi>Iohn</hi>) ſlyes, &amp; he giveth a reaſon of his flight, <hi>Quia mercenarius oſt,</hi> becauſe hee is an hireling, and that the ſafety of the ſheepe concernes him not, becauſe he is not charged with them. But the true Paſtor who underſtands that the blood of his ſheep muſt be required at his hands, and that their ſalvation becomes a part of his owne, amazed with ſo many threats uttered by the Prophets againſt the bad Paſtors, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon their flockes in time of neceſſity, he awakes his ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, he revives his courage, he expoſeth himſelfe to labour, and danger, inclining his heart to all the juſtifications of our Lord, for the retribution which he expects from him alone. Let us now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how our Regulars behave themſelves, who are ſent unto this worke onely by delegation, by miſſion, of aſſiſtance by extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary commiſsion, as troopes of reliefe, and voluntary labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. This laſt ſufficiently declares. <hi>Mercenarius autem fugit &amp;c.</hi> The hireling flyes, becauſe he is a hireling, &amp; hath no care of the the ſheep. So as if he do labor in feeding of them, his labour is but voluntary, &amp; mercenary, &amp; accordingly (as it often happens) moſt pittifully performed. For as the Regulars onely governe ſuch ſoules as of their owne election, without any obligation commit themſelves unto their conduct, ſo on their part have they the choyſe in this great harveſt, of what eares of corne they pleaſe, in this great draught of fiſhes, which they like beſt, caſting the reft
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:17038:26"/>into the water, to ſend them back unto their proper Paſtors. In ſo much as the people doe make uſe of them ſo long as they pleaſe, ſo doe not they ſerve the perſons of the world, but ſo long, &amp; in ſuch ſort as they think beſt, the place of their reſidence being that which is conformable unto their liking, like unto wandring ſtars, (to uſe the phraſe of the Apoſtle) whoſe influences worke not ſo ſtrong impreſsions, forſomuch as they caſt not their beames, but by way of paſſage, whereas the ſixed ſtarrs are the ayme whereby all Mariners direct their Navigations. So this moſt learned &amp; holy Biſhop.</p>
               <p>Well then, underſtanding reader <hi>(Odi enim prophanum vulgar &amp; weceo)</hi> Thou ſeeſt what authors, how many, and of what quality, who all flouriſhed ſince the comming in of the Mendicants) have ſharpned both their tongues &amp; pens, againſt their diſordered and wicked lives. Whereas then ſome (&amp; thoſe not of vulgar appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions) have taxed me of indiſcretion for inveighiug in my bookes againſt the faults of Eccleſiaſticall perſons, my ſelfe being of the ſame rank &amp; profeſsion, for my part I underſland not their language. For I have alwayes heard that the maintaining of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſique errours in doctrine, &amp; not the refuting of them, the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of manifeſt impieties, and not the reproving of them, to be ſcandalous. And the Apoſtle gave this charge unto <hi>Timothy: Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantes coram omnibus argue, ut et caeteri timorem habeant,</hi> I. Timoth. 5. Such as ſin publickly reprove, that others may feare. Theſe men (I ſee) doe wiſh me much good, for they would have meo more wiſe, more learned, &amp; more vertuous then <hi>S.

Might theſe then make to the life pictures of our deformed Regulats, with their black pencills of a deep reproofe, &amp; ſhall not I be permitted to draw one ſmall line in their tables? Shall theſe to the face of the world, &amp; in the eyes of this ſun, ſtrip &amp; whip the Friar at their pleaſure, &amp; ſhall not I be licenſed to lay on one ſingle laſh? Or is it
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:17038:26"/>that they have received already their 40. ſtripes ſave one? Might theſe ſpirituall Phyſicians make deep inciſions, &amp; lance them with words more piercing then any two-edged ſword, &amp; may not I be allowed to rub their galled backs with one dramme of vinegar? Might theſe Prelars &amp; Prieſts thunder in every pulpit againſt their errors, &amp; abuſes, &amp; not ſo contented, leave their invectives in their workes &amp; monuments to be read of poſterity? <hi>Mene mutire nefas?</hi> And may not I utter one little word, but preſently I ſhall beſerved with a citation from the ſpirituall Court, the Court of conſcience? <hi>Nolite annunciate in Geth, neque annuncietis in compitis Aſcalon, &amp;c.</hi> O publiſh it not in <hi>Geth,</hi> nor preach it in the ſtreetes of <hi>Aſcalon,</hi> leſt peradventure the daughters of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> do rejoyce, &amp; the daughters of the unci. cumciſed triumph. For Lord, who ſees not how miſtaken, &amp; miſapplyed that text is to the purpoſe that theſe men would draw it. Wiſt not <hi>David</hi> that the death of <hi>Saul &amp; Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathas,</hi> &amp; that victory in which the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> prevayled againſt the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> could not be concealed from <hi>Goth,</hi> nor <hi>Aſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> or any other City, or habitation of the Churches enemies? But <hi>David</hi> the more emphatically to expreſſe his griefe in that deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation &amp; heavineſſe of the ſynagogue, in the ſlaughter other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces &amp; people, uſeth that manner of threane or lamentation, aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating that dayes calamity in conſideration of the great content, joy, &amp; triumph that it would miniſter unto the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious enemyes.</p>
               <p>So let us never perſwade our ſelves, that our publique errors ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in doctrine, or manners can be concealed from thoſe who are of a diverſe beliefe from us, neither theirs from our knowledge, ſo long as we live together in the ſame common-wealth, or border one upon another.

See for this S. <hi>Thomas 2<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 2 ae. q.</hi> 68.1.3. &amp; <hi>q.</hi> 70.1.2. And in this ſence no donbt it was that <hi>Conſtant in</hi> the Great, that firſt Chriſtian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, moſt Chriſtianly ſaid: That if he ſaw an Eccleſiaſticall man to doe what was indecent, or amiſſe, he would cover him with his purple robe, meaning he would ſo conceale his faults, as neither the delinquent ſhould receive diſhonour, nor the Church ſcandall thereby. As for manifeſt &amp; knowne offences, we heare what al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God hath ſaid by his Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> 58. <hi>Clama, neceſſes, quaſi tuba exalta vecem tuam</hi> &amp;c.

And the Apoſtle exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his ſcholler <hi>Timothy</hi> as to exhort, intreat, and beſeech, ſo to blame, reprove, &amp; correct, &amp; that by his owne example, who ſo little feared the face of man, as to comply with his Apoſtleſhip, he would freely &amp; publickly reprehend ſuch as were manifeſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, &amp; eſpecially falſe teachers he would rouſe out of their dens, &amp; place the in the ſight of the ſun.

Two wayes after this life may a man be deprived of this bleſſed viſion thorough his owne default: Either eternally, which is a full ſeparation of the creature from the bleſſed viſion of God the Creator. Or a ſuſpenſion for ſome time. The former hath with it an abdication unto eternall puniſhment. <hi>Diſcedite à me maledicti in ignem aeternum.</hi> Depart from me ye curſed into hell fire.

Now if the doctrine of our Friars be good divinity, all matters of the ſoule after this life are moſt ſweetly accommodated. Firſt, for hell we have ſeen in the former. Chapter, the fire thereof quite extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only by dying in the Carmelites Scapular, or the Franciſcans Habit, ſo as a ſoule furniſhed with either of thoſe commodityes, may ſay with the Poet:
<q>Contempt aeque jacent, &amp; ſine luce faces.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now in this Chapter it is conſiderable whether they be not as forcible to quench the flames of Purgatory, which if they doe, <hi>I am labor in fine eſt.</hi> We have no more to do, but like <hi>Ioviall</hi> lads to paſſe our dayes <hi>Lucanicè</hi> in al pleaſures, &amp; delights, &amp; a fig for what may betide us after death.

For theſe be the words of their pretended indulgence (I ſay pretended) for undoubtedly it was never authorized by the See Apoſtolicke. The works are theſe, as they lye in that former abridgment of their priviledges cited in the beginning of this work, and falſty fathered upon <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> 7. Pope of that name. <hi>Die quo à ſaeculo hujuſmodi purgatorium acceſſerint ipſa virgo glorioſa Dei genitrix Maria ſabbatho ſequenti poſt illorum confratrum, ſeu religioſerum ac ſororum obitus viſitando, à poenis Purgatory hujuſmodi corum animas liberabit.</hi> By reaſon of this double <hi>Hujuſmodi,</hi> I confeſſe I am not ſo good a ſcholler, as to make any ſenſible conſtruction in Engliſh of theſe words, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that I have both learned my Grammar, &amp; have my ſelfe compoſed one. But yet we find by their ſermons, conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, bookes,&amp; diſputations, that upon thoſe words the Friar <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melites</hi> conclude that by the benefit of the <hi>Scapular,</hi> every ſoule that is adjudged unto Purgatory, whoſe body in death was inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fted therewithall, by the miniſtery &amp; viſitation of the bleſſed vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, &amp; under her conduct ſhalbe delivered thence the next ſatur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day after their deceaſe, which (as I ſaid before) muſt needes be at the longeſt terme within eight dayes after death. Yet ſith the paines of Purgatory are ſo grievous, happy (ſay I) be they who dye on Friday night, becauſe the day following they ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered thence. Now you muſt know that none have authority to give you this ſo holy a Scapolar, but ſuch a Prieſt as is of the Order of the <hi>Carmelites.</hi> They have alſo in the aforeſaid Treatiſe, another priviledge granted (as they ſay) by Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the 4. &amp; Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi> the 4. (but it is not to be believed, but rather what <hi>Thomas Walſingham</hi> writ, cited in the former chap.

               <p>Another priviledge they father upon Pope <hi>Vibanus</hi> 6. &amp; <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> 5. That whoſoever ſhall call the Friar <hi>Carm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:17038:28"/>Here is no ambition to be called the brethren of the bleſſed Virgin the Mother of God, &amp; Vncles unto our Saviour? To the imitation of which ſpirituall kinred &amp; alliance, it is very like that our <hi>Ignatian</hi> Friars, or <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> albeit with more modeſty, doe call themſelves the fellowes or companions of our Saviour. And of all Friars, I know none of ſo conſpicuous deſcents, &amp; of ſo great a blood &amp; houſes, as theſe two, the <hi>Carmelites</hi> to be the brethten of the bleſſed Virgin: The <hi>Ignatians</hi> to be the companions of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> But why not? ſince our Saviour hath ſaid, <hi>Math.</hi> 12. <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall doe the will of my Father that is in Heaven, he is my brother, and ſiſter, and mother.</hi> Sith then our Saviour is contented to admit into his kinred ſuch as ſhal do the will of his Father without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of perſons of what quility ſoever, from the <hi>Cedar</hi> to the <hi>Hyſſop,</hi> from the <hi>Pope</hi> to the <hi>Sexten,</hi> from the <hi>Prince</hi> to the <hi>Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</hi> To what end are theſe reſtrictions? theſe ſingularityes of ſtiles &amp; titles importing a limitation, or rather a kind of an excluſion of their brethren from ſuch ſpirituall prerogatives, eſpecially our Saviour having left them to the generall extent of a <hi>Quieun<expan>

Our Saviour bids us, when we have done our beſt endeavours, ſay we are unprofitble ſervants. The Pope calls him ſelfe <hi>ſervum ſervorum dei,</hi> the ſervant of Gods ſervants. The Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can is commended for not lifting his eyes to Heaven, but knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his breſt, and calling himſelfe a ſinner. The Prodigall Child hold it too much to be called his fathers ſon. The invited Gueſt is commanded to take the loweſt place at the table. And we know who ſaid to the Apoſtles, contending which of them ſhould be the greateſt. <hi>Quicunque voluer is inter vos maior fieri, ſit veſter mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> &amp;c. Math. 23. He that would be the greateſt among you, he ſhall be your ſervant. And he that exalteth himſelfe ſhalbe hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and he that humbleth himſelfe ſhalbe exalted.</p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:17038:29"/>
               <p>And albeit it pleaſeth our Saviour ſometimes to grace his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers with high ſtiles, and termes full of love &amp; honour, as he who knoweth the worth and merit of all his ſervants: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, to call them his friends, his brethren, his fellow-heires, his children, his diſciples, his ſervants. Yet it becomes not poore ſilly &amp; wretched man, who either knowes his own miſery in this val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of teares or is more miſerable in being ignorant thereof, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach nearer unto his Creator, then the Portall of <hi>Pulvis &amp; cinis.</hi> Shall I ſpeake unto my Lord being but duſt &amp; aſhes? not knowing whether in this life he be worthy of love, or hatred, a veſſell of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or diſhonour, but that whatſoever good he hath, is by grace from Heaven, &amp; not of himſelfe.</p>
               <p>And ſo much for the power of the <hi>Carmelites</hi> Scapular in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Purgatory. The ſumme of all whoſe doctrine in this point is: That the bleſſed Virgin the Mother of God, deſcends from Heaven every Saturday (but whether before noone or after, it is uncertaine) to deliver all ſuch as have dyed in the <hi>Scapular</hi> the week before. The occaſion of which ſuppoſed priviledge (as far as I can conjecture) was this: The <hi>Carmelite</hi> Friars hearing that the <hi>Franeiſcans</hi> did preach and publiſh unto the people: That <hi>S. Francis</hi> every yeare upon his feaſt day (which falls upon the 4. of Octob.) comes down from Heaven, and deſcending into Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, carryeth away with him all thoſe who the yeare before dyed in his habit, and deſiring by all meanes that their <hi>Scapular</hi> might not be inferiour, but rather in greater requeſt &amp; eſtimation then the habit, &amp; thinking a yeare too long a time for poore ſoules to be tormented in thoſe flames, they obtained a priviledge (as they tell us, but moſt falſly) from the Sea Apoſtolick, that their ſcapulariſts ſhould ſtay no longer then a week at the moſt, but every Saturday ſhould be delivered thence. So as I do not a little wonder wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Friars of <hi>S.

Heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Biſhop called all his Clergy of the Citty, and the Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars together, the 15. of Ian. very late at night, &amp; there the Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, eſpecially Friar <hi>Terence O Brian,</hi> Prior of the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> in <hi>Limerick,</hi> and Friar <hi>William Crah,</hi> ſuperiour of the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> alſo in <hi>Limerick,</hi> accuſed the ſaid Guardian of the <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> aſwell

               <p>And thus have you the true relation of ſuch troubles as hapned among our Church-men of <hi>Limerick</hi> this laſt Winter about the priviledges of the <hi>Franciſcan</hi> habit, in which as in a map, you firſt behold the venters &amp; broachers of falſe doctrines in the perſon of the Vicar general, &amp; the Guardian of the <hi>Franciſcans.</hi> In the ſecond place is preſented unto you the office of a good Paſtor, &amp; the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full performance of his duty in the Biſh. of the Dioceſſe.

But experience from time to time hath taught us, that they be too violent and head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong to be ruled by any Church law. Neither let the Reverend Biſhop of <hi>Limericke</hi> be troubled with their diſobedience unto him. For the Pope himſelfe ſhall not be able to commaund them
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:17038:30"/>further then ſtands with their own good liking. To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, it ſhall not be from the purpoſe to ſet down what that reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend, pious, and learned Biſhop of <hi>Bellay</hi> in <hi>France, Iohannes Petrus Camus</hi> obſerved at his being in <hi>Rome</hi> in the late dayes of <hi>Clement</hi> 1.

               </p>
               <p>Being on a time in <hi>Rome</hi> in the dayes of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> 8. whoſe memory is in benediction, and in a ſweet odour of ſanctity, for his verity, equity, and manſuetude, who being much urged, (not to ſay importuned) with many queſtions and diſputes touching the Habits and Beards of Cloyſter-men, he had a reſolution to bring unto the raſor, and unto the hood, all ſuch as call themſelves Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and who live in communityes, &amp; obſerve Monaſtick vowes. This gave ſuch an <hi>Alarme</hi> to them who had taken the Cap &amp; the Habit of ſecular Clergy, the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> and <hi>Theatines,</hi> &amp; an other ſort who had made choyce for their character the long Beard, I mean the <hi>Conventualls, Carthufians,</hi> and <hi>Capuchins,</hi> that it was much to be feared, that the good Pope (whoſe name is in veneration tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough all Chriſtianity) had not felt the effect of thoſe mortall Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanyes, with which ſome Monkes doe threaten thoſe who are not favourable unto them. For ſure had he but touched the checkes of the one with the razor, &amp; had thruſt the heads of the other into an hood, he had tryed their reſignation &amp; obedience to the quick. but to avoyde troubles, &amp; jealouſies, the good Pope held it better to let that buſineſſe ſleep, then to taſt the humours of his froward &amp; diſcontented children.

If any deſire to know the names &amp; number of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Friar Biſhops of this Kingdome, they be as follow: <hi>Them. Flemming</hi> aliàs <hi>Barnwell,</hi> aliàs <hi>White</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Dublin</hi> Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcan. <hi>Boethius Igan</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Elfin,</hi> Franciſcan. <hi>Hugh Magen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Downe,</hi> Franciſcan. <hi>Roſſ Magoghagan</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Kildare,</hi> Dominican. <hi>Patrick Cumberford</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Waterford,</hi> Auguſtin, which laſt is the only indifferent Friar Biſhop unto the Clergy, of all that ever yet were ſent into this Kingdome. Some others we have, who albeit they were elected out of the body of the Clergy, yet becauſe ſtanding upon their own feet, they were not able to reach the apple of Epiſcopall promotion, they moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the Friars ſhoulders, &amp; by their alone meanes have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the ſame, and for that cauſe are litle more loving unto the Clergy, or leſſe beloved of the Friars then the former, holding it a point of gratitude, &amp; the leaſt kind of remuneration for ſo great a benefit, to be at the beck and command of that Friar, whether it be <hi>Wadding</hi> the Cordelier, or any other, by whoſe ſollicitation they received their nomination unto a Biſhop rick, bound ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to tread in their ſteps, &amp; to run their courſes. But fure for my part I ſhould think the ſame Church-pollicy, which is practized
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:17038:34"/>in <hi>Rome,</hi> in debarring Friars theſe 50. yeares &amp; upward from the Apoſtolicall Chaire, might bee obſerved thorough the whole Church, as beſt beſeeming the Eccleſiaſticall Hierarchy, &amp; the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment thereof: I mean the Clergy to be governed by the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, the Friars by the Friars, without making ſuch a mixture of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, as we ſee at this day: one Dioceſſe ruled by a Clergy Biſhop, another by a Franciſcan, the third by a Dominican &amp;c. which is rather to lay a corner ſtone of diſcention, then any foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of unity, to plant a ſeminary of diſcord &amp; contention, then a nurſery of peace &amp; concord, &amp; the ſame not only for the preſent, but even deſcending unto poſterity.</p>

               <p>And verily the preſent government of the Clergy in this, and ſuch Dioceſſes, as the Friar Biſhops do rule, makes me call to mind
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:17038:34"/>that tyranny of the <hi>Danes,</hi> as well heere in <hi>Ireland</hi> as in <hi>England,</hi> to whoſe violence, not only the Republique in generall, but every private family was obnoxious, having their eſpialls and intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in every place &amp; corner of the countrey, in ſo much as unto the baſeſt groome among them, for feare of his diſpleaſure, the honeſt ſubject was in ſuch thraldome, as he would be glad to give him the beſt place at his table, &amp; to feed him even <hi>ex adipe frumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti;</hi> with the beſt morſells he had, &amp; to call him at every word, My Lord <hi>Dane,</hi> whence it comes to paſſe, that in theſe dayes, we call by contraction every idle vagabond, a <hi>Lordan,</hi> borrowed I ſay, from that lubber of a <hi>Dane</hi> who was appointed to domineer in every mans houſe. Yea (if my memory faile me not, which is the firſt faculty of the mind that decayes in old-age) it is written in ſome of our Chronicles, that if an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man had been upon the midſt of a bridge, &amp; had ſeen a <hi>Dane</hi> make towards the ſame, though a musket ſhot before him, the <hi>Saxon</hi> would have returned back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, &amp; have left the bridge unto the <hi>Dane</hi> to have paſſed over. And even ſuch <hi>Lordanes</hi> for all the world be our <hi>Iriſh</hi> Friars, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to devoure the fruits of the earth, for which moſt of them ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſwert in any lawfull vocation, abſolutely commaunding the whole houſholds in which they live, &amp; all too little to doe them ſervice, reſpect, &amp; honour. Thoſe that be houſe-keepers do more feelingly then my ſelfe underſtand the diſcommodities of the ſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and malapert carriage of theſe ſturdy beggars among them.</p>
               <p>It was on a time, when a Friar of S. <hi>Francis</hi> Order comming to a Gentle-mans houſe, ſeated within the ſmoak &amp; proſpect of <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blin</hi> &amp; finding the gate ſhuts for why? the Goodman of the houſe with all his family were ſet to dinner, neither was there written over the gate.</p>
               <q>Porta patens eſto nulli, clauderis honefto.</q>
               <p>The Friar ſeeing-himſelfe thus prevented, &amp; his ſtomack perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him that he was in extremeineceſſity of his dinner, he betook himſelf unto the hammer of the gave, &amp; ſo belaboured the broad payle, as I know not whether <hi>Brontes</hi> the great Smithy man, with his biggeſt hammer fetched from his right care, could lay weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier ſtroakes upon his anvill. But ſo it was, as the Friar found the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:17038:35"/>proverbe true. <hi>Venter non babet aures,</hi> the belly hath no cares; and no admiſſion or anſwer could he get, notwithſtanding that <hi>propter improbitatem,</hi> by reaſon of his importunity he perſwaded himſelfe, had they bin all in bed, &amp; faſt in ſleep, they would have riſen &amp; miniſtred unto him. And no queſtion but as his hands did labor at the hammer, ſo did many a cogitation hammer in his braines, ſometimes bewayling the declining of hoſpitality thorough the Kingdome, the hardneſſe of rich mens hearts: ſomtimes again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking him of the vertue of perſeverance, comforting himſelfe with theſe &amp; the like promiſes: <hi>Petite &amp; accipietis, pulſate &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perietur vobis:</hi> Aske &amp; you ſhall receive, knock &amp; it ſhall be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto you. But nothing did more trouble the Friars mind, then when he fell into conſideration of that Legacy of <hi>S. Francis,</hi> written under his Image commonly at their altars. That in what place ſo ever his Friars ſhould be, they never ſhould want neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry food, or rayment, the truth of which Legacy he found his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack now to call in queſtion. O how often did he examine the gates, whether the weather, or wormes, or time more conſuming then either wormes, or weather, had made any little windowes, by which he might eſpy ſome bleſſed body to paſſe over the baſe court within, but all in vaine, for aſſoone might hee have looked thorough the ribs of the Trojan horſe. What will you have of it? <hi>Laſa patientia ſit furor,</hi> wronged patience turnes into fury: the Friar gathers up a number of ſtones, as <hi>David</hi> did when hee went to let fly at <hi>Golias</hi> his head, though far bigger, for this Friar is alufly bouncing <hi>Cordilier,</hi> &amp; not ſuch a ſhrimpe as <hi>David</hi> was, theſe he throweth againſt the gates of <hi>Droncondran</hi> with many a vengeance upon all thoſe who keep their gates ſo cloſe ſhut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Friars: but alas, as <hi>Priams</hi> darts rebounded back when they arrived at <hi>Pirrhus</hi> his armor of proofe, accuſing the weak &amp; feeble arme of the thrower: So did the ſtones which Friar <hi>Iohn Preſton</hi> ſent againſt the aforeſaid gate, leaving ſome few dints of his doughty choller, but nothing which might relieve his hunger. At laſt the Friar all malecontent, betakes himſelfe unto his palfrey, and with a froward kind of patience, purſued the reſt of his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. But time paſſing on with ſwift, though ſilent paſes, not long
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:17038:35"/>after he meetes with old <hi>Iohn Bath,</hi> (whoſe ſoule God pardon,) he relates what a challenge he made him, what documents he gave him, among which I remember, this was one: What wiſt you, but that the beſt and deareſt friend you have might have bin at your gates at that houre? It is againſt the lawes of hoſpitality, &amp; the cuſtome of <hi>Ireland</hi> to ſhut their doores at meale time &amp;c, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us both, he either forgot to tell me, or I to demaund, what ſatiſfaction was made for that error. And now I wot well, what the Friar will ſay, or others for him: Alas M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Harris,</hi> is this all you have to ſay againſt that ancient Guardian, and now a definitor of his Order. It ſeemes if you had worſe, it ſhould out.

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:17038:36"/>his fault, &amp; preſumption, in violating ſuch lawes, as both Church &amp; Common-wealth in all ages from our very cradle of Chriſtianity in theſe Kingdomes have maintained, conformable to the Law of God, &amp; fitteſt for government, as I have abundantly declared in my Book againſt the Archbiſhop <hi>Flemming</hi> his Excò<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication.

But the man was taken as he was, &amp; in a new mould could not now be caſt.

               <p>But ſome will ſay, That all the Friars are not ſuch as I have repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to be, for which cauſe I ought to have made a diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> twixt the good &amp; bad, the corne, &amp; chaff, the ſheep, &amp; wolves &amp;c. And not ſend them all to the devill together in one bagg, as I have done.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:17038:39"/>be layd to the charge of <hi>Novatus,</hi> or his diſciples? <hi>Pelagius, Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantius,</hi> and many moe, whoſe lives we find little or nothing taxed by ſuch as in their writings have condemned them, yet were they moſt vile &amp; wretched heretiques notwithſtanding what morality or ſeeming holineſſe ſo ever appeared in their outward converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions according to that of S. <hi>Aug.</hi> in Pſal. 4. <hi>Vbi ſana fides non eſt non poteſt eſſe vera juſtitia:</hi> where there is not a ſound faith, there can be no true juſtice. And it hath bin the cuſtome of heretickes from time to time (obſerved by the Fathers) under the vaile of formall ſanctity to ſhadow their wicked doctrines. Now our Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars be of two ſorts, both naught, and both miſbelievers. Either the Inventors and publiſhers of thoſe damnable doctrines above refuted, or ſuch as being their diſciples do adhere unto them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the ſame misbeliefe. For if I could find but one Friar among them, that would diſclay me thoſe errors, that would ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther write, or preach, or any way publiſh in his perambulations, the errors of his fellowes: Oh how I would ſtroke his head, and embrace him! how I would exempt him from the leaven, &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of his fellowes, &amp; would glory in his converſion! But O fearefull is that ſaying of the Apoſtle <hi>S. Iohn</hi> in his ſecond Epiſtle ſpeaking of the doctrine of the Church. <hi>Si quis venit ad vos, &amp; hanc doctrinam non affert &amp;c.</hi> If any man come unto you, &amp; bring not this doctrine, receive him not into thy houſe, nor ſay, God ſave you, unto him. For he that ſayth unto him, God ſave you, (Note the conſenting unto others in ſin) communicateth with his wicked workes. Now experience teacheth us, that not only the learned Friar, but the unlearned, and the lay-brother: yea the more unlearned, the more zealous, itchy, &amp; buſie are they in divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging among the ignorant people theſe ſalvations of habits, &amp; ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulars, hawkes bells, and hobby-horſes. How then can the one be more excuſed then the other? Or why ſhould they not all bee put in one faggot, and ſent to the fire together?</p>
               <p>So much then for the Friar. But yet my ſcrupulous reader de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to be further ſatisfyed, and that is in a ſecond point, demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as thus. How can you <hi>Paul Harris</hi> be excuſed for being ſo harſh in your writings, and ſo diſreſpective unto your Ordinary, as
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:17038:39"/>may appeare by ſundry paſſages both of this, and other of your Bookes, eſpecially being a Prieſt of his Dioceſſe, &amp; living within the compaſſe of his juriſdiction. Ought not a good Prieſt with all reverence &amp; reſpect, both in his words and writings, to ſhew duty and obedience unto his Biſhop? according to that of S. <hi>Paul, Ohedite praepoſitis veſtris:</hi> Obey your ſuperiours and ſuch as be ſet over you. And <hi>S. Hierom ad Neopotianum. Esto ſubjectus Pontifici tuo, &amp; quaſi parentem animae tuae ama.</hi> Bee obedient unto thy Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and love him as the parent of thy ſoule.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer. That indeed ſuch is the priviledge of Biſhops by the Lawes of holy Church, that none may either cenſure them, or publiſh &amp; declare them to be hereticks (ſpeaking of ſuch decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as is inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by the Canon but only the Pope, neither before ſuch declaration, according to the common opinion doth a Biſhop looſe his juriſdiction or the power of a Paſtor over his flock, or in any of his three Cenſures; <hi>Excommunication, Suſpenſion,</hi> or <hi>Interdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> Yet notwithſtanding all this, if a Biſhop ſhould obſtinatly maintaine, and publiſh any doctrine condemned by the Church in a Generall Councell, the leaſt Prieſt in his Dioceſſe might be ſo bold to call him an heretick, &amp; both preach and write againſt him, for example of <hi>Arianiſme, Donatiſme, Pelagianiſme,</hi> &amp; the like, &amp; yet remaine ſubject to his juriſdiction notwithſtanding. For the voyce of the Church, which is the voyce of God, is to be firſt heard and obeyed, and to be preferred before any other. And it is the rule of S. <hi>Aug. Ser. 6. de verbis Domini.

               <p>After this againe, two of his Friers having threatned violence unto my perſon: I ſent a petition unto <hi>Tho.

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:17038:40"/>Laſtly, having certaine bookes detained from me by a Pariſh Prieſt, &amp; a Friar <hi>Carmelite,</hi> I ſent my complaint again unto him, by the hands of a Friar of his own order, (for unto his own preſence he would not admit me) whoſe name is <hi>Iohn Parry,</hi> but after hee underſtood than the petition came from me, he neither would read or touch it, but did grow into choller with the Friar for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting it unto him. Behold the equity, the mildneſſe, the longani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of a Friar Biſhop, his charitable &amp; prudent government, his care of adminiſtring juſtice unto a Prieſt of his charge. But I was a ſtranger, &amp; muſt be ſtrangely uſed, &amp; in place of protection made a prey, not onely to the wild beaſts of the foreſt, but even unto the petulant and ſturdy rams of the flock; by all which it appeares that I may truly ſay &amp; complaine, as Almighty God did of the If<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra elites unto <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1.

I have not caſt off my Biſhop, or with-drawne my obedience from him, but he hath caſt off me: of which ſort of deſertion I perſwade my ſelfe he will not be able to alledge a preſident in the whole Church of God. Well, the Vine being thus forſaken of his ſtay, the ſheep deprived of the care of his ſhepheard, as if with <hi>Daniel</hi> I had bin throwne into the Lyons den. Lord, whoſe tongues were not untyed? whoſe teeth not ſharpned againſt me? <hi>Imo &amp; in me pſallebant qui bibebant vinum.</hi> Well, I then found by experience what formerly I had heard: That a man may live without father or mother, but not without Iuſtice. So then it hapned. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my bookes unjuſtly detayned from me, no other remedy appearing, I repayred for juſtice unto the preſent Lord Chiefe Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Kings Bench, to him I addreſſed my petition. And by meanes of his honourable command, I recouered them out of the hands of the injuſt detayners. But what followes upon this. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily as the Poets faigne, that in ſome ſtormes all the windes have blowne at one time, according to that, <hi>Vna curuſque, Notuſque ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt,</hi> &amp;c. So now all the whole Regulariſme of this Kingdome from the foure corners thereof; <hi>Monke, Dominican, Franciſcan, Auguſtine, Carmelite, Capuchin; Ieſuit,</hi> with all their followers, God knowes what an hideous tempeſt they rayſe againſt one poore
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:17038:41"/>Prieſt, how they rage, how they ſtorme? And now the Friar <hi>Thom, Flemming</hi> who before had diſclaymed me for a ſheep of his flock, &amp; would intermeddle in no cauſe of mine with me, or againſt me, begins to aſſume a-freſh his Epiſcopall juriſdiction over me, and divulgeth me both in publick and private aſſemblys, to be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, and why forſooth? for bringing the Prieſt <hi>Brangan</hi> by a warrant (in the cauſe of my bookes) before a ſecular Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall: Vpon this, no man hence forward muſt eat or drinke with <hi>Paul Harris,</hi> no man may converſe with him, no man muſt ſalute him, or bid God ſave him. For why? <hi>Incidit in canonem.</hi> He is fallen within the penalty of the Canon. Nay rather, <hi>Incidit in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones,</hi> He fell into the hands of a company of the eves, who woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him, and leaving him halfe dead, he had utterly periſhed, had not the good <hi>Samaritan</hi> taken compaſſion of him. Now albeit I have handled this matter in my late anſwer unto <hi>Thom.

But of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is manifeſt, and will well appeare by the records of the Kings Courts, by bookes of the common law, and their reports in every Kings raigne, that in the caſes above mentioned, both Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Prieſts, Abbots, Priors, Superiours of Convents, in behalfe of their ſubjects, and all ſorts of eccleſiaſticall perſons, both male, and female, have had their trialls in the aforeſaid caſes before the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Tribunalls: (witneſſe both the Canoniſt, and the Common Lawyer) I ſay, theſe grounds conſidered, It is evident to any man of common ſence, and underſtanding, that either that Canon which in theſe civill actions drawes the plea unto the eccleſiaſticall court of Biſhops, or any other ſpirituall Iudges, was either in theſe king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes never received: or if it were at any time in obſervance, by cuſtome beyond all memory was abrogated.

Nay rather is it not the univerſall conſent of all divines, together with the Canon it ſelfe. That the permiſſion of the Pope in any Church law, ſeeing the ſame either from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning not to be obſerved, or by contrary cuſtome antiquated, and notwithſtanding is ſilent, and makes no oppoſition thereunto excuſeth the ſubject from ſin, as preſumed to approve and allow of the ſaid practiſe.

So this Friar of the contrary, by his gloſſes and paraphraſticall expoſitions, labours to draw the Articles of the engliſh confeſſion, to the Catholicke and Roman doctrines. But let the Friar wring, and wreſt till he be weary, he ſhewes himſelfe but a time ſerver, a ſlatterer, and a meere Alchimiſt, adulterating both the doctrine of them, and us, and ſeeking to pleaſe both, (a inſt reward for ſuch a worke) contenteth neither, of whom it may be ſaid, as of the dead ſerpent ſtretched all along upon the graſſe. <hi>Amo ſic vixiſſe oportuit,</hi> yea ſo thou ſhouldeſt have lived.

                     <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> writing unto <hi>Titus</hi> whom hee had made Biſhop tells him, that therefore he left him in <hi>Crete</hi> to place Preiſts by cittyes as he appointed him. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5. and in the ſame chap. he ſheweth of what quality and condition thoſe Prieſts ſhould be.

And ſo indeede, it cannot be denyed but he hath done, for beſides what hath paſſed in the country, we obſerve that in this citty of <hi>Dublin</hi> in place of F. <hi>Tho. Coyle</hi> Paſtor of S. <hi>Michaells,</hi> and in place of F. <hi>Luke Rochfort,</hi> ſometimes paſtor of S. <hi>Andeons</hi> he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:17038:46"/>F. <hi>Patricke Brangan</hi> and F. <hi>Edmund Doyle</hi> (I ſay) upon the deceaſe of the 2. former, who in their life time converſed with ſuch commendations in the houſe of God, which is his Church, as they have left behinde them a ſweet odour, as well of their paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, as perſonall vertues among us, inſomuch as their names and memoryes remaine gratefull to poſterity. Now if thoſe their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors before mentioned doe in all vigilancy, charity, chaſlity, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, and longanimity, aemulate their predeceſſors, then neither will the Archbiſhop I know, who deſigned them unto thoſe emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent places the 2. eyes of his epiſcopall See, nor the preſent Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bents themſelves be offended with me, for inſerting their names into this my Epiſtle, neither neede they to bluſh, or bee aſhamed thereof, for ſo much as the Apoſtle ſayth that ſuch Prieſts as go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne well their flockes are worthy of double honour eſpecially they who labour in the word and doctrine, and to whom, no doubt it ſhall be ſaid in that day, <hi>Euge ſerve bone &amp; fidelis quia in pauca fuiſti fidelis, &amp;c.</hi> Well done good and faithfull ſervant, for that thou haſt been faithfull in ſmall matters, I will ſet thee over great, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the joyes of thy Maſter. And ſo much for thoſe 2. Recto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries or paſtorſhips, conferred as wee have ſeene by the Ordinary, and upon what perſons.</p>
                     <p>Now ſo it hapned againe as within theſe few weekes a third pariſh alſo became vacant by the deceaſe of the late Incumbent Fa. <hi>William Donagh</hi> in S. <hi>Thomas streete</hi> the ſuburbs of <hi>Dublin.</hi> And it is worthy our conſideration to obſerve how our Archbiſhop ever like himſelfe proceeded in the collation thereof. Wee finde that Popes ſometimes by way of proviſion, as the Canoniſts tearme it, to places of great dignities, as Archbiſhopricks, and the like have in the life time of the Incumbents nominated their ſucceſſors, who upon the vacanſie, were to take poſſeſſion of them. So (I take it) that <hi>Anſelmus,</hi> and after him <hi>Lanfrancus</hi> was preferred to the See of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> To which imitation happily <hi>Tho. Flemming.</hi> Dioceſian of <hi>Dublin</hi> (either to ſhew the ſuperaboundance of his paſtorall care, or elſe to let the world underſtand how little he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards what opinion his clergy conceives of him) made a deſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of 4. ſeverall Prieſts to that one Paſtorſhip, the profit whereof
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:17038:46"/>will hardly pay for a mans chamber and diet by the yeare, and this he did during the life of the Incumbent, who deceaſing, one of the 4. enjoyes it, the other 3. are fruſtrated, and what conceive they of this their Archbiſhops dealing, but that they were meerely delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and gulled by him, pretending great care of their preferment, and minding no thing leſſe. Sure if a farmer of <hi>Fing all</hi> ſhall paſſe his promiſe in any matter of moment unto 4. of his neighbours, which can be made good but unto one, I wot well he ſhall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led but a couzening churle. If a Gentleman or a noble man ſhall do the like, mens cenſures happily may be more civill in tearmes, but their opinions not a whit the better. For as their equals will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect them, ſo their inferiours will bee ſure to ſet their blacke markes upon them. But for a man not only of a noble family, but a Prieſt, and an Archbiſhop whoſe perſons are held ſacred, to bee found either with guile in their lips, or gifts in their hands, What can we ſay? but liſting up our voyce with our Saviour in admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Filius hominis veniens putas inveniet fidem in terra?

                     <p>Notwithſtanding the Prieſt <hi>Dela Mar,</hi> forall theſe faire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made unto him in his letter, was diſappointed of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and another placed therein. And it ſeemeth albeit the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop ſubſcribed the letter he writ him. Your aſſured <hi>Thomas Barnwell</hi> yet it was but a complementall and a ceremonious aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. For the good prieſt found it nothing reall at all, as the event proved. Some are of opinion that when the Archbiſhop intends otherwiſe then he writes, he then ſubſcribes <hi>Tho. Barnwell,</hi> but when he writes as he intends, then he ſubſcribes his letters, <hi>Tho. Flemming, Is ne animis caleſtibus astus?</hi> May wee thinke ſuch hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſme to rule in heavenly mindes? O no! charity would make a more pious conſtruction of ſuch a prelates actions. Wherefore I am rather perſwaded that the Archbiſhop never failes to make good his word or promiſe unto any (of which from time to time I confèſſe, he is more challenged then all the Biſhops in Ireland) (I ſay) that he never violateth or breaketh the ſame, either as hee is <hi>Tho. Flemming,</hi> or <hi>Tho. Barnwell,</hi> or as he is of a noble houſe, or
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:17038:47"/>as he is a Prieſt, or as he is an Archbiſhop, but onely as he is a Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, to which ſort of people, either lying is eſſentiall, or ſure in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mens opinions proper, <hi>quarto mode,</hi> and even in the Iudgement of that moſt pious and learned Monke <hi>Tho. Walſingham</hi> ſpeaking of the Friars in theſe words (not now firſt by me alledged) <hi>In tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum etenim illam veritatis profeſſionem ſuam perverſe vivendo macu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larunt, ut in dicbus iſt is in one cujuſtibet bouwn ſet argumentum, teneus tam de forma, quam materia. His eſt frater; Ergo mendax. ſicut &amp; illud. Hoe eſt album: Ergo coloratum.</hi> They have in ſuch ſort ſtayned that their profeſſion of truth by their unhappy living, that in theſe dayes in every ones mouth it is a good Argument, holding as well in forme as matter. This fellow is a friar, <hi>Ergo</hi> a lyar. Even as to ſay. This thing is white, and therefore hath a colour. So <hi>Tho. Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingham</hi> in the raigne of <hi>Richard</hi> 2. <hi>fol.</hi> 266.</p>
                     <p>But ſome will ſay <hi>Cuibonam?</hi> To what end ſhould the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop uſe ſuch doubling, or to whoſe benefit in conferring of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices are the waters allwayes ſo troubled among us? I anſwere, therein lyes a miſtery not yet reveiled unto babes. You know S. <hi>Paul</hi> wiſheth that in the Churchall things bee done <hi>Ad adificatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi> I. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. and ſo it is with us, but how? <hi>Ad adificationem Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularium,</hi> to the building up of the Friars Monarchy, and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Clergy, for this is the common <hi>Antiphona</hi> ſung in the Iriſe Church in theſe dayes, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p with the Friars: and, Downe with the Priests.</hi> Now for our Archbiſhop albeit unto ſtrangers, &amp; ſuch of the laity as take no notice of his proceedings, theſe things are hidden and obſcure, yet the Prieſts of the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> who have ſummered and wintered him now theſe ten yeares, doe feelingly underſtand the drice of his deſignes. Neither in any thing doth he more ſervice unto the Regular orders then to make theſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broylements in the conferring of paſtorſhips.</p>
                     <p>For firſt by theſe anticipate promiſes of one pariſh unto many (none ſuſpicious of any promiſe made unto other then himſelfe) our prelate obſerves, which of them is moſt ſerviceable and duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto his Friars, which of them is the beſt benefactor with their friends to him, &amp; his order, which of them is likeſt to prove <hi>â Iohannes ad oppoſitum</hi> to the reſt of his owne body, and to prove
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:17038:48"/>the moſt factious againſt the Clergy, in ſiding with the Friars on whom henceforward he is to have his whole dependance.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, by this precollation of benefices unto many, <hi>ſede non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum vacante</hi> the Ordinary finds which of them is like to prove the moſt gratious unto the pariſhioners and which of them is the moſt like to draw the good liking, love and affection, of the laity unto him. For that prieſt ſhall be aſſured (notwithſtanding all his golden promiſes) to goe without the pariſh. For it is againſt the Friars greatneſſe that any ſhould be more pleaſing unto the people then their ſelves.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, by this conferring of <hi>Cures</hi> afore-hand unto divers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ignorant one of another. It may be expected that every one of them armed with a promiſe from the Biſhop and he happily a far off in ſome friary in the country when they fall voyde, that theſe competitors may enter into ſome ſcandalous conteſtation one with another, every one thinking himſelf wronged by the other, an occaſion which the Friars will not omit to take hold of, to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them both in private and publicke aſſemblyes, and for their ſakes the reſt of the Clergy as men ſeditious, factious, contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, covetuous, eſpecially to and before the laity, and all to alienate their mindes from them, like unto greedy millers every one ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to draw the griſe unto their owne mills, notwithſtanding that the ſame Friars have beene the plotters and incentors of all thoſe differences.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, let it be alwayes remembred as a golden rule and the moſt principall maxime of their pollicy, that the moſt inſufficient pretender of any cure be the man that ſhall be ever preferred: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience by induction of examples hath furniſhed us with that knowledge, for a Prieſt whom God hath bleſſed with talents of learning &amp; good parts is an <hi>Aristides,</hi> not fit to live in <hi>Athens,</hi> but rather to be baniſhed <hi>per oſtraciſmum,</hi> For it is concluded by our Regular Biſhops that the Friars muſt ſhine amidſt ſuch blind cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, <hi>Tanquam lunainter minora ſidera,</hi> like the moone among the leſſer ſtars.</p>
                     <p>You ſee my Lo. I am no flatterer, neither is the diſcontent of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a benefice under you that makes me ſo plaine with you, for not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:17038:48"/>that I have lived in this kingdome now very neere theſe twenty yeares, you know neither myſelfe, nor any other for me, did ever motion ſuch a buſines unto you. And albeit (I heare) ſome have wiſhed you to thruſt a ſteeple into my mouth, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ſilence me, yet (I ingenuouſly confeſſe) ſooner ſhould old <hi>Eleazarus</hi> eat ſwines fleſh, then that I would ſwallow the ſame; Not but that to be a paſtor of ſoules is an honourable vocation in Gods Church, but that I am now too old, to be a Friars horſeboy. No, no let us have no new faſhions in church governme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the old is the beſt, &amp; ſuch as was ordained by our Saviour. Let us keepe our old prieſts, &amp; ſend back theſe ſwarmes of friars over unto their monaſteries where they may live according unto their holy Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, &amp; not here to <hi>vagabu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dare per tabernas &amp; popinas,</hi> ſelling their merits, their prayers, their penances &amp; mortifications, yea not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of their own perſons, but of their whole orders, and that under large ſealed patents, unto Cookes for diet, to merchauts for broad cloath ſuits, to gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for horſes, &amp;c. beſides oppreſſing a poor country with ſuch ſhameles begging, as little differeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meere rapine &amp; extortion. The church may ſubſiſt, yea, flouriſh without friars, but not without prieſts, as for many ages it hath done. For be they white, black, or gray, they are of a latter inſtitute then the prieſts, theſe being the ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles, &amp; the 42. diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, they of S. <hi>Francis, Dominick</hi> &amp; <hi>Ignatius.</hi> &amp; of a diſtinct hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy. If I be a <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> &amp; preach in the wilderneſſe without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit: That is not my fault, but the fault of them that wil not amend their faults. It were more pleaſing &amp; contentfull to me to come <hi>in spiritu lenitatis,</hi> in the ſpirit of mildneſſe, then in the rod of corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. If the ſubject were ſo diſpoſed.
