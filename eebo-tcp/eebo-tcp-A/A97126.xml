            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

will it be needfull to contend about the reading of this particular

the Tranſlatours do not all agree, but without any violence

            <p>It is placed in the midſt of this ample portion of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> as the

            <p>For though Interpreters do generally no otherwiſe look upon it,

of the breſt and the wombe (which are the other part of the

            <p>Unto that gracious providence figured and promiſed in that
apparition, <hi>Moſes</hi> hath an eye in this Text, praying the like for
<hi>Joſephs</hi> poſterity in like caſe of hazard and danger, and bequeath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it to them as the beſt part of their portion: for to ſtrain it
to the preſervation of the virginity of <hi>Mary</hi> in the conception

            <p>Having thus found the meaning of the Text, I beleeve
your thoughts out-runne me, and take up the doctrine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me.</p>
            <p>A peculiar extraordinary providence in favour of a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
people,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> in whom is neither might nor worth, is an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
peculiar bleſſing, both the whole ſeries and webb of ſuch
a providence, and every remarkable paſſage of it.</p>
            <p>Every overture of mercie and grace, in a time of trouble, every
aſſay of deliverance, though the ſalvation be not preſently perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
nay though many croſſe providences intervene, that raiſe
many difficulties, and make the preſent ſtate more grievous, more
perplexed; yet if God revive his work, and there be ſuch things
done by his hand as carry in them a teſtimony of his compaſſion,
a pledge of his faithfullneſſe, an evidence of his neerneſſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and reſcue, it is to be acknowledged a very great happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>When a nation is not worthy to be beloved, and the rod of
Gods diſpleaſure is put into the hands of bloudthirſty and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull
men, and they help forward the affliction, and there be
little or no probability of better condition by men or means; if
then the Lord will make offer and tender of his good will, and
one may diſcerne in his workes, in his waies a gracious propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie
and purpoſe to redeem, though in the proſecution thereof
there be ſuch various and uneven diſpenſations of providence, as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113095:6"/>
may give occaſion to the enemy to be hardned and inſolent, and
the other ſide to be diſcouraged and dejected; yet if God ſo
temper his judgements, as his own people ſhall feel the benigne
and comfortable, and the Adverſary the hurtfull and deſtructive
effects thereof, he will ſtep in, to reſtrain, or inhibit, or prevent
the fraud or fury of the enemy, and take the advantage of their
animoſitie and attempts; to glorifie himſelfe, in ſhewing forth his
wrath, and making his power known upon them; and the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while
continue to protect, and repeate, and multiply wonders
in favour of his people, to the confuſion of the adverſary, it muſt
be confeſſed a very great mercy, tranſcending the good of peace
and plenty.</p>
            <p>Though <hi>that</hi> may be doubted which ſome have affirmed,<note place="margin">Greg. Niſſen. Lippomannus.</note> that
the brightneſſe of the flame of the fire in the buſh, did darken the
brightneſſe of the Sunne at noon-day; yet this muſt be believed,
that the bleſſing of adverſity is better then the bleſſing of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity.</p>
            <p>What ever the opinions of vain men may be concerning this
thing, yet all thoſe who have ſtood on the ſame ſide, with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and word of God, have ever been of this judgement. Let us hear
two or three ſpeak for all the reſt.</p>
            <p>1. What elſe can we make of that expreſſion of <hi>Ezra,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Proof by Scripture. <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 13.</note> words
that come from the very heart root, and ſpeak affection to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
<hi>And hath given us ſuch deliverance as this?</hi> Why what
was this deliverance, that he could not finde words to expreſſe it?
'Twas but a deliverance in the ſhell, barely diſcloſed, deliverance
in the blade, not the ear, in the ſpring, not the harveſt, they could
not then eat of the fruit of it; as the light in the twilight, not
the noon, neither light nor darke, or rather both in a mixture and
viciſſitude. The books of <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> will informe you;
or if it be too much to read the ſtory,<note place="margin">Pſalm. 126.</note> the Pſalme will tell us, <hi>Their
captivity was turned,</hi> yet ſo, as they needed to pray ſtill, <hi>turne
again our captivity, O Lord:</hi> they were not reſtored to that
from which they were fallen, either for number of people, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of wealth, or liberty, or beauty, of order in the Civil or
Eccleſiaſticall ſtate; more perſons had fallen in ſome one bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
before the captivity, then were inrolled at their returne from
<hi>Babylon; David</hi> alone of his own proper good, had contributed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113095:7"/>
more to the building of the firſt Temple,<note place="margin">2 Chron, 29. 4.</note> then the whole Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
together were able to offer towards the reedifying of the
ſecond: Poſſibly one man had been owner of more cattell then
all of them could number, when they were come up into their
own land, they did not enjoy the liberty of an Iſraelitiſh ſubject,
but were under the arbitrary power of a Tyrant, who bare rule
over them at their pleaſure;<note place="margin">Nehe. 8. 36, 37.</note> 
               <hi>They were ſervants in their own
land, and it yeelded much increaſe to the Kings, whom God had
ſet over them becauſe of their ſinnes:</hi> Onely they had found
ſome favour with the Heathen Monarchs: Proclamations had
been iſſued in their behalfe, ſome liberty granted by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> ſome
additionall enlargement by his ſucceſſours, ſome ſpeciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences
had been diſpenſed in anſwer of their prayers, a door of
hope was opened; but there were many adverſaries, and they dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wreſtled with many difficulties and diſcouragements, even
among themſelves were found many wicked and ill affected
perſons; at that very time there was cauſe of ſolemne mourning
and faſting: Yet even this deliverance, this way of God in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will
to them, the holy man magnifies with no little wonderment;
hereof he was glad as they that dreame, in an extaſie of joy and
admiration; he looks upon it as an over-excellent object over-powring
his heart, that he cannot finde wordes for it, <hi>And haſt
given us ſuch deliverance as this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Pſal. 144. 15.</note> The Pſalmiſt ſpeaks it plainly, though he cannot
ſpeak it fully; <hi>Happy is the people that is in ſuch a caſe,</hi> yea <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
are the people whoſe God is the Lord.</hi> He weighs both ſtakes,
with the advantages of each one againſt the other, and in his
judgement this caſts the ſcales, and more then counterpoiſeth the
good of that: for if the former words, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12, 13, 14. and part of
the 15. <hi>That our children,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Happy is that people that is in
ſuch a caſe,</hi> be the wiſh and boaſt of the vain men mentioned,
<hi>verſ.</hi> 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>? then he oppoſeth thoſe laſt of his own to theirs, nay
<hi>happy are the people whoſe God is the Lord:</hi> or if he ſpeaks his
own thoughts, looking to the promiſes and bleſſings of the Law,
yet then he correcteth himſelfe, and preferreth this to the former,
counting them happy who ſuffer affliction, if God be amongſt
them <hi>in good will, as when he dwelt in the buſh;</hi> rather then thoſe
<hi>who spend their daies in wealth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 21. 9, 13</note> 
               <hi>whoſe houſes are ſafe from
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:113095:7"/>
fear, neither is the rod of God upon them;</hi> whoſe ſoever the words
be, without controverſie he gives the precedencieto that for which
he had firſt prayed, <hi>viz.</hi> an extraordinary providence towards
him in times of trouble:<note place="margin">Pſal. 144. 12, 13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>Bow the Heavens, O God, and come
down, ſend thine hand from above, rid me and deliver me out of
great waters, from the hand of ſtrange children, whoſe mouth
talketh of vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falſhood.</hi>
And by the way it may be noted, how he can number and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
the bleſſings of plenty and proſperity, can gaze upon the
pomp and glory of them, and finde language to ſpeak as much as
heart can wiſh or thinke: but the priviledge of protection and
deliverance in troubleſome times (while God <hi>teacheth the hands
to warre and the fingers to fight,</hi>
               <note place="margin">ver. 1, 1.</note> while God becomes <hi>the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
fortreſſe, tower, deliverer and ſhield of his ſervants, ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and ſcattering their enemies before them.</hi>) He rather ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires
then comprehends; he cannot graſpe what he ſaw, nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly
expreſſe what he apprehended: affections ſwallow up
words: <hi>Happy is that people whoſe God is the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But why do we look ſo farre, when we may finde proof ſo
neer in the laſt verſe of this very chapter: <hi>Happy art thou, oh
Iſrael, who is like unto thee, oh Jacob, ſaved by the Lord the ſhield
of thine helpe, and who is the ſword of thine excellencie?</hi> The
Rhetorique is very high, yet very intelligible, and its meaning ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
diſcernable, an ordinary capacitie will reach it, eſpecially if
but imagine the man of God now upon the mount of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
(as we finde him in the next Chapter on the top of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo</hi>)
looking round about him on the courſe of Gods providence
in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in the wilderneſſe, and in the land in times of diſtreſſe,
and giving liberty to his heart with contentment and gladneſſe
to feed upon the good things, the manifold good folded up in
that bleſſed ſtate, wherein the Lord did more immediately and
openly intereſt himſelfe in their cauſe, in every difficulty and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all oppoſition, either miraculouſly in the want and abſence
of means, ſupplying and ſaving-by himſelfe; or marvellouſly in
the inſufficiencie and diſproportion of means, commanding an
efficacie, and creating an iſſue beſide their thought, beyond their
expectation, to their advantage and priviledge, eſpecially in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of warre; elſe what means the mention of <hi>ſhield and ſword?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:113095:8"/>
A ſhort paraphraſe will ſmooth and clear the abrupt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
expreſſion, if any thing may ſeem obſcure in it, and lend
much light to the proofs of the doctrine in hand; for the words
do manifeſtly bear this ſenſe: Oh the happineſſe of the people,
the care of whoſe welfare the everlaſting God doth take upon
himſelfe. The multitude, the variety, the world of mercies min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
with judgements, the abundance, the infinite of good put
into their hands, dropt into their mouthes by the gracious and
glorious adminiſtrations of providence. Oh the excellence, the
luſtre of the prerogative of ſuch a people above all other nations,
outſhining the ſeeming cloudineſſe and uncomfortableneſſe of
their unſetled diſtracted condition! They perhaps may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
thinke themſelves in a worſe eſtate then other men, becauſe
of the diminution and obſtruction of their ordinary liberties, by
the want of common accommodations and conveniences; but
if they were taken off their prejudices, and knew their own
happineſſe, there were none to be compared with them, the
worlds wonder and envy; having God ſo nigh them, ſo ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably,
ſo manifeſtly, ſo admirably preſerving and providing for
them: its impoſſible to ſet forth the excellencie of their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
words will not expreſſe it, the minde cannot fathom it, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
cannot reach it. <hi>Oh the happineſſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But we may well ſet aſide particular witneſſes, for there are
three or four things in Scripture that we cannot lightly paſſe by
without obſervation, which corroborate the teſtimony produced.</p>
            <p>Firſt, This bleſſing is the bleſſing of the promiſes, moſtly the
matter of Gods promiſes, ſpeciall ſolemne promiſes, other things
are the object of mens wiſhes and deſires; <hi>Oh that thou wouldeſt
bleſſe me indeed, and enlarge my coaſt, and that thou wouldeſt
keep me from evil, that it may not grieve me:</hi> but if God ſaw
cauſe at any time to fore-acquaint his people with his good will,
about the concernements of their outward temporall eſtates, the
prophecie and the promiſe are uſually of theſe, and of this kinde,
we finde very many, very ample, and very remarkeable diſcoveries
and ingagements in <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God is more oft proclaimed by Names and Titles
that are relative to ſuch a providence, and the bleſſings of it, then
by any other in another way. Its very obſerveable; the Lord
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:113095:8"/>
delighteth to be known, and godly men to acknowledge him;
He frequently glorieth, and they glorifie him in the notion, and
under the names of Saviour, deliverer, redeemer, and the like.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Many proviſions were made by God and good men,
for preſerving and publiſhing the knowledge and remembrance
of ſuch providences and mercies: Anniverſary feſtivals were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
and ſolemnized, divers monuments erected, names gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to perſons and places, proverbiall ſpeeches taken up, records
kept,<note place="margin">Numb. 21. 14.</note> Journals, Annals, Chronicles written of them; the Hiſtory
of the Bible (and a great part of the Bible is hiſtory) what is it
but a webb of ſuch wonders, like a rich piece of imbroyderie,
moſt pleaſing to the eye, a light worke upon a ſad ground? of
other matters it may be ſaid, as of the ſtory of thoſe who gave
themſelves to mechanick and ſecular imployments, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4.
22. <hi>Theſe are ancient; or obſolete things,</hi> things held unworthy
of memory, there were no memorials of them; but there was a
law for the recording of theſe, and all means uſed to contribute an
infinitie, an eternity to their fame, and the glory of God in them.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, If the affections of men and their expreſſions may
ſpeak any thing in the praiſe of this bleſſing, we finde that alſo
in the Scripture, for they otherwaies bleſſed the God of their
mercies for theſe then for other bleſſings, they celebrated the
praiſe of God in theſe Pſalmes and ſongs of thankſgiving, with
all largeneſſe of heart and elegancie of ſpeech: Its ſtrange, what
apprehenſions the very Heathens ſeemed to have of the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
and preeminence of this bleſſedneſſe, and by what fictions they
repreſented their fancies.</p>
            <p>But when the holy men of God made recognition of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and advantages of an extraordinary providence, they ſpake
in ſuch ſtraines (not of fancie, but affection) as never men ſpake;
no not themſelves, but at ſuch times, and on ſuch occaſions.</p>
            <p>Beſide the light we have by the teſtimony of Scripture, we
may evince and perſwade the truth of the doctrine, by evidence
of reaſon and experience; and truly we need all manner light
and proof, for it is a <hi>Paradox,</hi> like <hi>Sampſons</hi> riddle, <hi>meat out of
the eater, and ſweet out of the ſtrong:</hi> but we may eaſily finde it
out, if we will conſider the wayes of God in ſuch a ſeaſon, either
in their reference to himſelfe, or unto his people. Theſe two
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:113095:9"/>
things ſeriouſly pondered and without prejudice, will clear the
truth, and perſwade an acknowledgement.</p>
            <p>The workes of God, in the way of extraordinary providence,
do make moſt viſible, moſt clearly viſible, the inviſible things of
God, even his eternall power and God head: His workes are
wonders,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145. Mognalia Dei, Mirabilia Dei.</note> 
               <hi>wondrous workes, mighty acts, terrible deeds,</hi> ſuch as
declare <hi>his greatneſſe,</hi> as ſhew <hi>the glorious honour of his majeſty,
the glorious majeſty of his Kingdome:</hi> He gives abundant eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of his preſence in dreadfull manifeſtations, ſo that all eyes are
made to behold him, and every tongue to confeſſe to him We may
read his Name in Capitall flouriſhing letters, written as with a
Sunne beame, <hi>glorious in holineſſe, fearfull in praiſes, doing
wonders.</hi> We may behold him as a <hi>man of warre,</hi> in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
bright armour, as a King in his royall robes, <hi>glorious in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell;
He ſaw,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 59. 16, 17.</note> 
               <hi>and there was no man, and he wondered that there
was no interceſſour; therefore his own arme brought ſalvation
to him. He put on righteouſneſſe as a brest-plate, and an helmet
of ſalvation upon his head. He put on garments of vengeance for
a cloathing, and was clad with zeal, as with a cloak.</hi> We may ſee
that which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſings, <hi>The Lord triumphing gloriouſly,</hi> in the
greatnes of his excellencie, overthrowing thoſe that riſe up againſt
him.<note place="margin">Pſal. 15. 28.</note> We may ſee him <hi>working all in all,</hi> a bleſſed ſight, and
which makes them bleſſed that have the happineſſe to behold it;
as holding ſome proportion with that beatificall viſion in Heaven,
where <hi>God ſhall be all in all.</hi> And this fairly leads up to the other.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Then he communicates his goodneſſe with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
moſt eminently, then <hi>he rides upon the Heavens for the helpe
of his beloved, and in his excellencie on the skie;</hi> he diſcovereth
himſelf openly, and ſeaſonably, in a way befitting his unſearchable
greatneſſe, for their relief and help: He walks amongſt them in
paths of mercy and truth, <hi>both his hands full of bleſſing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, In ſuch times he deals out the bleſſings of the right hand,
the moſt ſure mercies, the light, the ſupport, the ſupplies, and the
comfort of his word and Spirit, the triall of grace, the increaſe of
grace,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 7.</note> the fruit of grace; bleſſings much <hi>more precious then gold
that periſheth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 48. 10.</note> 
               <hi>though it be tried in the fire:</hi> then he chuſeth his
people,<note place="margin">Ezek. 20 5.</note> avoucheth, challengeth, redeemeth, ranſometh them, and
avengeth himſelfe upon their enemies.<note place="margin">Iſa. 50. 4, 50</note> Then he lifteth up his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:113095:9"/>
hand and maketh himſelfe known to them:<note place="margin">Iſa. 27. 9. Iſa. 4. 4.</note> He wakeneth their
ear, prepareth their heart, and fealeth their inſtruction: Then he
convinceth and humbleth them, purgeth away their droſſe, takes
away their ſinne, waſheth their <hi>filth, their bloud,</hi> and refineth
them <hi>by the spirit of judgement, and by the spirit of burning:</hi>
Then he gives a ſpirit of prayer and ſupplication, and is nigh unto
them in all things they call upon him for:<note place="margin">Zech. 13. 9.</note> 
               <hi>They ſhall call on my
Name, and I will hear them; I will ſay, It is my people, and they
ſhall ſay, The Lord is my God:</hi> Then he openeth <hi>the book of his
remembrance, written before him for them that fear the Lord,
and thinke upon his Name, and he maketh them up as his jewels
or speciall treaſure,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mal. 3. 16, 17.</note> 
               <hi>and ſpareth them as a father his own ſonne
that ſerveth him.</hi> Never doth the Church and people of God
enjoy more of God, and more eminently, then in the times of their
trouble, when he comes down to redeem them with great judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In that time alſo the Lord dealeth out the beſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
<hi>of the left hand,</hi> the moſt beneficiall mercies, <hi>deliverances:</hi>
indeed all providence, in ſuch a ſeaſon, is deliverance; ſo <hi>Ezra</hi>
looks upon it;<note place="margin">Ezra 9. 13.</note> 
               <hi>And hast given us ſuch deliverance as this:</hi> So
God himſelfe interprets that to which my text alludes; <hi>I have
ſurely ſeen their affliction,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezod. 3. 8.</note> 
               <hi>and I am come down to deliver them.</hi>
All the bleſſings received or poſſeſſed in ſuch a ſeaſon, are but the
appurtenances and additaments to deliverance; and ſo the Pſalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt
confeſſeth, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136. (a Pſalme that hath none like it in
all the Pſalter,) while he ſummes up all the ſtory of Gods extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
gracious providence in this acknowledgement, <hi>And
hath redeemed us from our enemies, for his mercy endureth for
ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Now <hi>redemption</hi> is a moſt manifold bleſſing from much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
to much good: ye cannot look upon <hi>deliverances</hi> as ſingle
kindneſſes, they are pregnant mercies full of good, have many
mercies in the wombe, and bring forth abundantly.</p>
            <p>2. They are the moſt acceptable,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 14. 27.</note> refreſhing, reviving mercies,
like a bright ſhining after rain, hot gleams in uneven weather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
ſhowres, the brighteſt beams, and of ſtrongeſt influence;
like the honey <hi>Jonathan</hi> taſted in the wood; he put his hands to
his mouth, and <hi>his eyes were enlightned;</hi> like the water <hi>Sampſon</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:113095:10"/>
dranke in his faintneſſe, <hi>when he had drunke his ſpirit came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
even as life from the dead: Grace hath been ſhewed from the
Lord our God, to leave us a remnant to eſcape, that our God may
lighten our eyes, and give us a reviving in our bondage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3 The bleſſings of ſuch a providence, are mercies of the beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh;
as the fruits in Paradiſe, of Gods own creating, farre exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any at any time ſince produced by art or nature; as the water
out of the rock,<note place="margin">Deut. 32. 13.</note> pleaſant as honey and oyl: <hi>He made them ſuck
honey out of the rock, and oyl out of the flinty rock:</hi> as the wine
by miracle at <hi>Cana,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh 2.</note> the beſt wine, better then the pureſt bloud of
the grape, the maſter of the feaſt being witneſſe, who, if any, was
ſober and able to diſcerne: they are more immediately of Gods
working, and more immediately reached out of his hand, and
therefore the good that is in them is more pure and heavenly, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
more of his all ſufficiencie, and more univerſally anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and ſatisfying the deſires of the ſoul:<note place="margin">Wiſd. 16. 20, 21.</note> like the Manna which
fell in the wilderneſſe, bread from Heaven, Angels food: The <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi>
tradition ſaith, it was able to content every mans delight, and
agreed to every mans taſte, ſerving the appetite of the eater, and
was tempered to every mans liking, according to the deſire of
them that had need: And the Canonicall Scripture ſeems to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
it, <hi>Numb. 11. 8. The taſte of it was as the taste of oyl:</hi> now
they that love oyl, tell us, that pure oyl is to the taſte, as clear glaſſe
to the eye, it receiveth much of its favour from that wherewith
its mingled, as glaſſe doth its colour from that by which its laid.</p>
            <p>4. They are the moſt preſent convincing teſtimonies of Gods
grace, ſuch as bring along with them the cleareſt and fulleſt revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of divine favour: for they are wrought out not only in great
patience and longſuffering, but in tender compaſſion &amp; abundance
of goodneſſe, and therefore more ſweetned then other mercies:
The Lords portion is his people, <hi>he kept them as the apple of his
eye;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 31. 10, 11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>as an Eagle fluttereth over her young, ſpreadeth abroad her
wings, taketh them, beareth them, ſo the Lord alone did lead them,</hi>
in a kinde of ſympathy and fellow feeling of their miſeries:<note place="margin">Iſa. 63. 9.</note> 
               <hi>in all
their affliction he was afflicted, in his love &amp; in his pity he redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, and he bare them, and carried them all the daies of old.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. They are bleſſings given in, in returne of their prayers, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
of their longing deſires and earneſt expectations, the harveſt
of their hepes, and therefore reaped in with great joy and gladnes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:113095:10"/>
6. They are ſent as meſſengers and witneſſes of Gods truth
and faithfullneſſe, in remembrance of his ingagements, by rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
covenant or promiſe, and therefore ſpeaks comfortably
to the heart of thoſe that hope in him;<note place="margin">Exod. 3. 7.</note> 
               <hi>I have ſurely ſeen the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their
cry, by reaſon of their taskmaſters, for I know their ſorrows, and
am come down to deliver them</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. They are intended for pledges <hi>in earnest</hi> of others to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them, good <hi>Oſſes</hi> or <hi>Omens</hi> of more to come, as we finde
in the end of the Chapter; <hi>Happy art thou O Iſrael ſaved by the
Lord, thine enemies ſhall be found lyars unto thee, and thou ſhalt
tread upon their high places:</hi> like the ſignes which <hi>Moſes</hi> and
<hi>Aaron</hi> wrought before the Elders of <hi>Iſrael, Exod.</hi> 4 30. they are
diſpenſed, to beget a confident expectation, and to keep life in the
faith and hope of the poor of his people that wait upon him; and
therefore make them rejoyce in hope, incouraging to look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
with confidence and chearfullneſſe;<note place="margin">2 Cor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. 10.</note> 
               <hi>He hath delivered,
he doth deliver, in whom we truſt that he will yet deliver us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. They are ſet off with ſuch a foyle as render them far the more
amiable and acceptable, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſenſe of miſery, the fear of ruine,
the unquietnes and perplexity of a miſgiving minde, held in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
doubt and ſuſpence, a very manifold uncomfortable darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
which prepares the heart (as the rubbing of a bladder) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
good of God with more enlarged affections, and diſpoſe the
ſpirit to drinke in the contentment more abundantly, and increaſe
and multiply the joy and thankefullneſſe in the acceptation.</p>
            <p>9. Of all bleſſings theſe come the leſt look'd for, and therefore
the more welcome; for though nothing is more deſired, yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more deſpaired then preſervation or deliverance in the
needfull time of trouble.</p>
            <p>10. And laſtly (which makes the meaſure heaped and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
over) in ſuch a ſeaſon there are multitudes of theſe mercies
of both kindes; as we ſay of ſtormy weather when the Sunne
breakes out between clouds, there are many fair daies in one: there
is a repetition and multiplication of mercies:<note place="margin">Pſal. 103. 4.</note> 
               <hi>the father of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies

with another, for he ſees all their afflictions, and proportioneth
out conſolation, though not according to their fond or froward
wiſhes, yet according to their infirmity and neceſſity, which, by
reaſon of manifold tentations, require frequent, repeated and
multiplied tokens of his <hi>dwelling amongſt them in good will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All theſe things may be ſeen by the light of the flame in the
buſh, they may be all read in the ſtory, whereof the viſion, to
which the Text refers, was the praelude: They fall with in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of thoſe, who are ſo wiſe as to conſider the works and
ways of the Lord, and are found in the experience of them, who
have the happineſſe to acquaint themſelves with God, and to
wait for him in the wayes of his judgements.</p>
            <p>And by all theſe laid together, its very evident, that if the
good things of proſperity may be wiſhed<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </note> yet the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
things of adverſity are and ought to be admited; and if
there be any thing worth the name of a bleſſing to be found here
below in the valley of change, it is then when we are in the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
of ſtraits under a cloud, and God covereth us with his hand,
and ſheweth his glory, making his goodneſſe to paſſe before us,
even in troubleſome times, when the providence of God worketh
extraordinarily in favour of us.</p>
            <p>Now what remaineth, but that we make improvement of this
doctrine, for Gods glory and our own edification. A doctrine
moſt ſeaſonable for <hi>this time</hi> and <hi>this day;</hi> a time wherein the
Lord of glory dwels amongſt us, as when in good will he dwelt in
the buſh; a day of publike rejoycing and thankſgiving, for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p>It cannot be denied, but the bleſſing of the Text is our privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that this promiſe is our ſtory; for as the ſtate of the Church
and people of God, ſome years ſince, was not unlike to that which
was figured in the ſmoaking furnace which was ſhewed to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 15.</note>
when horrour and darkeneſſe had fallen upon him at the

of God are not unanſwerable to that which was ſhadowed in the

               <hi>we are not burnt;</hi> God
is nigh unto us, and ſtands between us and our harms, to reſcue us
from ruine: troubles are moderated, mercies are mingled with
judgements, we have more then our lives left us for a prey; and
though we walke ſtill in the fire, and are not yet called out of the
furnace, yet verily God is amongſt us, and there hath been a loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of our bond, an enlargement of our liberties, and we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
great deliverance in our trouble; ond though the heart of
the King be not effectually moved, either towards God or his
ſervants, to make ſuch an obſervation, acknowledgement and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,

to turne his heart as the ſtreams of waters; and we are incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

conſiderable teſtimonies of the good will of God dwelling with

the better prepared for his praiſes.</p>
            <p>It is now more then manifeſt, that <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> had long
ſince taken crafty counſell, by working wiſely to extirpate all
proteſtant Religion, to ſtrangle all the male children of the
Church at the very birth, to drown all maſculine profeſſion, and
to leave alive nothing but a looſe effeminate forme of godlineſſe
without the power, that the Papal Monarchy might be abſolute,
that <hi>Babylon the great, the mother of fornications and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

the conſciences of men, the people of God enſlaved to do his

            <p>For as for that other (whereof we have more ſenſe) the diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of our Laws, the introducing of an Arbitrary governement, the
diveſting us of our liberties and priviledges, and the attempts to
diſable us from ever getting the yokes from off our necks, it was
but a deſigne on the by, a device, a bribe wherewith to caiole and
hire the Court to their party.</p>
            <p>Now while all theſe things were in the darke to us,<note place="margin">Pſal. 64. 6.</note>

Who remembers not the flattery of <hi>Prerogative by the Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall

of neceſſity of advancing the <hi>Miter</hi> for the ſupport of the

of the people, by the Law of liberty on the Lords day; the
diſcountenancing of all vigorous profeſſion, by branding it with
the term of Puritaniſme; and though they commonly coupled
a <hi>Papiſt</hi> and a <hi>Puritane</hi> together in all their declamations; yet
they did but as the Butchers, that drive up a lean beaſt among the
fat ones, to get them into the ſlaughter-houſe, and then lets him
go back again to paſture.</p>
            <p>We have not forgotten what ſnares they laid for tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,

their juriſdiction; and how nigh we were brought to <hi>Rome</hi>
ere we were aware of it.</p>
            <p>When theſe things were thus, were we able to have reſcued our
ſelves from under the hands of thoſe who dealt cunningly with
us, and evil intreated us, and laid thoſe ſore burdens upon us?
Were we worthy that the Lord ſhould look upon our afflictions,
and ſend to deliver us? Did we ſo much as underſtand the drift
and depth of thoſe deſignes then on foot? the methods, the arts

            <p>I beſeech you let it not be forgotten, how unexpctedly, how
ſeaſonably, how marvellouſly, how graciouſly the God of our

when they were neceſſitated to take up <hi>armes</hi> for their juſt

gather the people of theſe Kingdomes to the battell of the Lord,
againſt Antichriſt and his Popiſh Prieſts? and when there was an
appearance of warre, was it probable that that little cloud in the

the ſtorme fallen ſo heavily upon that party who firſt provoked

            <p>In the beginning of this Parliament, when the manifold op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
and grievances of the Church and Kingdome began to
be repreſented by petitions, who did imagine there had been
ſuch a bleſſing in that cluſter? that that deſpiſed day of ſmall
things, ſhould have been prolonged, and proſpered into ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
of reformation?</p>
            <p>In the beginning of this ſummer, <hi>at the time when Kings go
forth to battel,</hi> what likelihood was there of ſo many daies of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing

            <p>Let us draw yet a little neerer to behold this great ſight, and
ſee, if names and places, and ſuch like circumſtances being chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
the late and preſent waies of our God amongſt us, be not like
to thoſe which <hi>Moſes</hi> looks at in this Prophecie: Or if I may
not take the liberty (becauſe the time is ſhort) to compare parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
yet give me leave to offer theſe remarkable things to your
obſervation.</p>
            <p>In the generall it muſt be acknowledged, that <hi>the Lord hath
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:113095:13"/>
his way in the ſtorme, and his fury is poured out like fire:</hi> but
withall, this cannot be denied, nay it ought to be confeſſed to the
praiſe of God: that even all that cloud hath been <hi>light</hi> to us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and darkeneſſe to our enemies: we have found by the good
hand of God upon us, a very great moderation of judgements, a
marvellous mixture of mercies, and therein wide difference put
between us and them:<note place="margin">Iſa. 27 7.</note> 
               <hi>Hath he ſmitten us as he ſmote thoſe

our low estate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and redeemed from the hand of our enemies;</hi> we
have been at our wits end, by the difficulty and perplexity of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
the Lord hath made the ſtorme a calme, and brought us out
into unexpected enlargement; when we have ſtood on the brinke
and precipice of ruin, he hath ſundry times ſnatched us off, and ſet
us in more ſafe eſtate: what we have managed weakly, and what
they have attempted confidently and watchfully, God hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled
for great good and advantage to us: and while they are left
to themſelves, to abuſe the providences of God to the exciting
and inflaming of their own animoſity, the enraging of their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and the hardening of their hearts, our God, whoſe <hi>dwelling is
amongſt us in good will,</hi> offers more grace to us; becauſe he hath
compaſſion on his people, he hath cauſed the trumpet to be
blown to the ſolemne aſſembly, and he ſendeth his meſſengers to
preach ſubmiſſion and converſion to God, repentance and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of life; and we hope that the names are more then a few
that learn righteouſneſſe, and mourn in <hi>Sion,</hi> and wait upon God
in the way of his judgements. True it is, there is no ſuch <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>
amongſt us, to whom God ſpeaks <hi>face to face,</hi> as he did to
<hi>Moſes,</hi> that can reveal the <hi>ſecrets</hi> of Gods counſel, concerning
the circumſtances of the manner and end of this unnaturall
warre; but great is the company of <hi>Preachers</hi> that interpret the
<hi>revealed will</hi> of God, concerning our duty and the waies of our
ſalvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is more neceſſary and more profitable for us to
know; neither is there any one ſingular perſon, that is ſuch an

the ſight of the Lord to provoke him to anger; yet doubtleſſe
there be many that are afraid of the anger and hot diſpleaſure of

aſide to ſee this great ſight, <hi>Put off thy ſhoes from off thy
feet:</hi> a double caveat.</p>
            <p>One to deny our ſelves,<note place="margin">Caution.</note> not only in curioſity and vanity of
minde, but in all low, earthly, ſenſuall reaſonings and paſſions, ſuch
as are incident to <hi>brutiſh men who know not,</hi>

not the deep thoughts and myſterious wayes of God</hi> in

go next the earth and gather dirt,) and to elevate the minde and
heart above all thats common, and which a naturall, carnall and
politick wiſedome, which is from below, would ſuggeſt; and as
if we were in the mount of transfiguration, to have high, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
and heavenly apprehenſions and ſtirrings of heart, in all hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and holy reverence adoring the majeſty of God, both in that
which we behold, and that which we cannot yet comprehend,
waiting till he further interpret himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Verily <hi>God is with us, nigh unto us,</hi> elſe <hi>how is all this befallen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> us?
and whence are all theſe miracles?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Judg. 6. 13.</note> the miraculous victories be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all expectation, ſo lately, ſo often given in unto us? The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
works done before us, are apparently wrought out, not by
the heads or the hands of men, but <hi>by the finger of God,</hi> or rather
his <hi>mighty hand and out-ſtretched arm,</hi> and are none other then
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:113095:16"/>
evident pledges of his nearneſſe to us <hi>in good will, as when he
dwelt in the Buſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other is to lay aſide all emulation, contention, &amp; vain jangling
about the merits of men, the praiſe or diſpraiſe of the men of Gods
hand, and in all humility to reſign up all pretences of claim or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
into the hands of God;<note place="margin">Ruth 5. 7.</note> for in this way of reſignation of right

            </p>
            <p>1. That the parties themſelves, whom God honoureth in the
ſervice, would give him all the praiſe, and let none of <hi>the fat of

               <hi>Not unto us, not unto us, but
unto thy name be the praiſe.</hi> And to ſpeak plainly for God; there
is none other cauſe; for what is, or hath bin praiſe worthy, beſides
the ſucceſſe; and who knowes not, who ſees not, that the event
is of God? When <hi>Gideon</hi> and his ſervant heard the <hi>Midianite</hi>
and his fellow tell one another the Dream,<note place="margin">Judg. 7. 13, 14 15.</note> and the interpretation
thereof, how a Barley-cake tumbled into the Hoſt of <hi>Midian,</hi>
and fell upon a Tent, and ſmote it, and over-turned it that the Tent
lay along, and they ſaw the carriage of the buſineſſe the next day
in the battell to anſwer it: what could they do leſſe than wonder
and worſhip? well might their hands be ſtrengthned to the war:
but it had been extream madneſſe and impudence to have gloried
in themſelves, and would have been revenged, as on <hi>Herod.</hi> The
ſpoyles of a victory may be divided amongſt men, but the honour
of a victory, eſpecially ſuch as ours have been of late, belong to
God alone. It is his glory, he is a jealous God, and will not give
it to another. It is <hi>his Crown,</hi> he that will ſet it upon his owne
head, or will not lay it down before the Throne of God, and the
Lamb;<note place="margin">Deut. 25. 9.</note> the Lord <hi>will looſe his ſhoe from off his foot, and ſpit
in his face.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſecondly, That ſtanders by, and lookers on doe look off,
look up above the inſtruments of Providence, to God who gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
victory in the day of Battel; neither quarrelling, nor idolizing
men or means; both which are equally ſacrilegious and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
before the Lord. Do ye think the Iſraelites had done well,
or would it have been accepted of God, if they had made odious
compariſons between <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> if they had decryed (as
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:113095:17"/>
indeed they murmured at) <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe by his hand they were
led about many years in the wilderneſſe, and met with many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
and diſaſters, and their carcaſes fell, and they conſumed
daily, and came ſhort of their hopes? and on the other hand had
lift up <hi>Joſhua,</hi> becauſe under his conduct the enemies were over-thrown,
and their walled Towns and ſtrong holds were gained,
and they proſpered in every undertaking. Had this been to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the hand of God, either in judgment, or mercy? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
God is not honoured where there is ſtrife, and variance, and
emulation in ſuch a way as this. If there be a miſcarriage at any
time, and our Counſels or our Armies, either erre, or proſper not;
it is our duty to fall upon our faces, and humble our ſouls, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of the Lord; and if any that offer themſelves willingly be
more ſucceſſefull, <hi>our hearts may be towards them,</hi> but <hi>Bleſſe
ye the Lord,</hi> Judge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. 29.</p>
            <p>3. I may adde a third caution to the two former, <hi>viz.</hi> That all
pomp and triumph be layd aſide in the dayes of our rejoycing and
thankſgiving; not that I judge it utterly unlawfull, but altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unfit and unſeaſonable; Ringing, and Bonefires, and ſuch ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities,
are for <hi>Tear-leſſe</hi> and bloodleſſe Victories over a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne
enemy, rather than in civill war; where they that get the
day,<note place="margin">Iudg. 24. 2, 3.</note> muſt needs poſſeſſe the victory, as the eleven Tribes did that
over the <hi>Benjamites,</hi> with <hi>cryes and tears:</hi> the conquerors can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
behold the ſlaughter of the enemy, but it muſt <hi>repent them
for their brethren, becauſe the Lord hath made a breach in their
own Nation, perhaps their own families:</hi> nor look upon the
gain of the Conqueſt, but as <hi>David</hi> did upon the water which
the Worthies fetched from out of the Well of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> which
was by the gate;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 23. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Is it not the bloud of the men that went in the
jeopardie of their lives?</hi> It would be poured out before the Lord.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 2.</note> When all this is done, there is yet a further uſe to
be made of this Doctrine; for we ſhall finde, that where the man
after Gods own heart readeth upon the Law of thankfulneſſe,<note place="margin">Generally to all.</note> He
interprets it thus; <hi>He that offereth me praiſe, glorifieth me, and
he that ordereth his converſation aright.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 50. 23.</note> So that God is not glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,
unleſſe there be a care of compoſing or diſpoſing our way,
as well as a ſacrificing of Confeſſions: and unto this alſo the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
is an engagement.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:113095:17"/>
For if an extraordinary peculiar providence be an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
peculiar bleſſing, then without controverſie there is ſuper-induced
upon us at this ſeaſon a very great obligation to walke
worthy the Lord, to have our converſation according to the way
of God in compaſſion of us, (<hi>For whom much is done, of them
much is looked for.</hi>) Elſe we ſhall return evil for good, and may
be ſure to hear of it, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> alſo did, <hi>Deut. 36. 6. Doe ye thus
requite the Lord, oh fooliſh people and unwiſe? Is not he thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
thee?</hi> To ſay nothing of what we read to this purpoſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
every where in the Books of <hi>Moſes;</hi> we may hear the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
preaching it very plainly, both the <hi>Duty</hi> upon this very
ground, and the <hi>aggravation of the ſin</hi> in the caſe of perverſneſſe,
and the <hi>recompence of</hi> the <hi>errour,</hi> upon ſuppoſition of the provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 8. He ſaid, <hi>Surely they are my people, children
that will not lye: So he was their Saviour. q. d.</hi> He took them
into Covenant, he admitted them into the neereſt relations: in
this caſe leſſe could not be expected, then that in all ingenuity they
ſhould have abhorred to degenerate into any falſe way, or fail to
be an holy people. In all the reaſon of the world (one would
think) they ſhould have reckoned themſelves bounden to anſwer
the loving kindneſſe and faithfulneſſe of the Lord, in all holineſſe
and righteouſneſſe of converſation before him all their dayes.
Upon theſe termes he took upon him their protection, <hi>So hee
was their Saviour:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 105. 45.</note> 
               <hi>That they might obſerve his Statutes, and
keep his Lawes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſa. 63. 8.</note> for ſo the Pſalmiſt expounds it; and if ye read
on to the eighth verſe, ye will finde the reſt; <hi>But they rebelled and
vexed his holy Spirit, therefore he was turned to be their enemy,
and he fought againſt them.</hi> The equity is ſo manifeſt, as nothing
more needs to be ſayd in it.</p>
            <p>Onely if you deſire to know what it is that God requires, and
we ought to returne, you may finde it, if you looke in the glaſſe
whereinto the ſpecies of the children of <hi>Iſraels</hi> face is ſhed,
I mean the ſtory of their Rebellions. We may read our duty
in their perverſneſſe, and ſee where to waſh our ſelves, by
their ſpots. Doubtleſſe, ye have heard of their provocations, and
the iſſues of them, they are gathered together into very ſhort
ſumme, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 95. ye may finde them a little more enlarged
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:113095:18"/>
and particularized in the 78, and the 106 <hi>Pſalms.</hi> Or if ye pleaſe
that I may run over the Hiſtory before you, in a few words wee
ſhall the more readily diſcerne what to amend.</p>
            <p>1. They did not abide in that good diſpoſition wherein they
received the firſt tydings and tokens of Gods good will to them.
When <hi>Aaron</hi> had ſpoken all the words which the Lord ſpake
unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> and had done all the ſigns in the ſight of the people;
<hi>The people beleeved,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 4. 30, 31</note> 
               <hi>and when they heard that the Lord had viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them, and looked upon their afflictions, then they bowed their
heads &amp; worſhipped.</hi> But in the next chapter, they lightly depart
from that acknowledgement upon the firſt diſcouragement,
where they found themſelves in an evil caſe, becauſe of their tasks,
<hi>they met Moſes and Aaron,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 5. 20 21.</note> 
               <hi>and ſayd, The Lord looke upon you,
and judge, becauſe ye have made our ſavour to ſtink in the eyes
of Pharaoh and his ſervants, to put a ſword in their hands to
ſtay us.</hi> And again, at the Red-ſea, when they ſaw the great
work which the Lord had done upon the <hi>Egyptians; they feared
the Lord, and they beleeved the Lord, and his ſervant Moſes;</hi>
but they <hi>ſoon forgate his works,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 78. 11. 22.</note> 
               <hi>and his wonders which he had
ſhewed them, and truſted no more in his ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, They bare all difficulties with great impatience, and
murmured upon every tryall, at the increaſe of their burdens, the
approach of the enemy, the bitterneſſe of the water, the want of
bread, the want of water, when they had not meat for their luſt,
when the Spies brought an evil report upon the Land, when
the way was tedious, and they muſt go about: At every turn, &amp; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all occaſions they complain, and rebell, and tempt the Lord.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They quarrell their deliverers, while they were
yet in the Land, and charge the injuries and oppreſſions done them
by their enemies, upon their beſt friends. In the Wilderneſſe they
are envious and mutinous, even <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> are drawn
into the conſpiracy. They miſunderſtand and miſapply the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God: the executions done upon the factious and ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
they impute to <hi>Moſes and Aaron,</hi> as bloudſhed and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
When the earth had opened and ſwallowed up <hi>Corah,</hi>
and his company; the next morning all the Congregation mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure,
and tell them to their faces,<note place="margin">Numb. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Ye have killed the people of
the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:113095:18"/>
Fourthly, They repine at their deliverance, even when it was
far advanced, and deſpiſe the ſalvation of God, and made an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to return into their old ſervitude; ſo baſe were their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
as they had rather have abidden under, nay, returned into
their cruell bondage, ſo they might have had their fiſh, and their
onions, then be ſaved by miracle, if they muſt be enſtranged from
their luſts: <hi>We remember</hi> (ſay they) <hi>the fiſh which we did eate
in Egypt freely, the Cucumbers, and the Melons, and the Leeks,
and the Onyons, and the Garlicks,</hi> Numb. 11. 5. <hi>were it not
better for us to return into Egypt? and they ſaid one to another,
Let us make us a Captain and return into Egypt,</hi> Numb. 14. 3, 4.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, They did not underſtand the works of the Lord, nor
truſt on their God, nor depend upon his Word, or rely upon his
Providence,nor waited for his Counſell; but hardned their hearts
through unbeliefe, yea, they ſpake againſt God, tempting and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting
the holy one of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for all the ſignes and wondrous
works which he ſhewed amongſt them.</p>
            <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">Pſal. 78. 8.</note> They were a faithles and ſtubborn generation, a genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that did not ſet their heart aright, and whoſe ſpirit was not
ſtedfaſt with God. They had engaged themſelves by ſolemn Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to Reformation, to depart from the cuſtoms of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and to
keep themſelves unſpotted from the manners of the Nations, to
receive a forme of worſhip from God,<note place="margin">Exod. 24.</note> a Law of Ordinances,
and to keepe his Commandements and be obedient: But they
made a Calfe in <hi>Horeb,</hi> they worſhipped the molten image,
they committed whoredome with the daughters of <hi>Moab,</hi> and
joyned themſelves to <hi>Baal Peor,</hi> and are the ſacrifices of the dead;
they kept not the Covenant of God, and refuſed to walke in his
Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly, They diſſembled with God in their humiliations
and profeſſions of repentance, which they were frequently put
upon:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 78. 34.</note> When his wrath was kindled againſt them, and he ſlew
them, then they ſought him, they returned and enquired after
God, and they remembred that the moſt High was their Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
nevertheleſſe they did but flatter him with their mouths,
they lyed unto him with their tongue; for their heart was not
right with him, neither were they ſtedfaſt in his Covenant:
<hi>Wherefore God was not pleaſed with them, for their carcaſes
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:113095:19"/>
fell in the Wilderneſſe; of all them that were numbred in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
of</hi> Sinai,<note place="margin">Numb. 1. 46.</note> 
               <hi>on the ſecond moneth of the ſecond year after their
comming out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>all the Males from twenty years old and
upward,</hi> Six hundred thouſand, three thouſand, five hundred
and fifty; <hi>not a man of them was found alive upon the Muſter
in the plain of</hi> Moab, <hi>a little before they entred into</hi> Canaan,
ſave Caleb the ſon of Jephunneh,<note place="margin">Numb. 26. 65.</note> and Ioſhua the ſon of Nun,
<hi>they were all conſumed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now theſe things <hi>are our examples,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10 6.</note> lively repreſentations
for inſtruction, to the intent we ſhould not walk unworthily, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerably
to the good will of God, in his peculiar extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
providence over us, (as they did) by levity and ſlightneſſe of
ſpirit, frowardneſſe, diſcontentedneſſe, malignancy, confederacy,
and compliance with naughty men; unthankfulneſſe, backſliding,
regardleſneſſe of Gods works; unbeleife, breach of Covenant,
impenitency, hypocriſie, or formality in our Faſting and Praying,
and pretence of Reformation, and amendment, and ſuch like:
but <hi>have another ſpirit with us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Numb. 14. 24. Ioſh, 14. 6.</note> 
               <hi>and follow the Lord our God
fully,</hi> leſt we be deſtroyed of the Deſtroyer, as they all were;
<hi>for all theſe things happened to them for enſamples, and they are
written for our admonition,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10 11.</note> 
               <hi>upon whom the ends of the World
are come.</hi> The ſins and the puniſhments of thoſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> are
ſet before us, as in a glaſſe, or image, that we may ſee in them
what to expect, if we alſo provoke the Lord as they did: Let us
behold our faces in this glaſſe, but not go away, and ſtraight-way
forget what manner of perſons we are; but repent, and be zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
and amend, ſo God ſhall be glorified, and we ſhall be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in our deed. This in generall, and for all.</p>
            <p>Now give me leave,<note place="margin">More particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to the Lords.</note> I beſeech you, <hi>Right Honourable,</hi> in all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
to offer a word or two more ſpecially to <hi>your Honours,</hi>
who are the great part of this Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords,</hi> ye are <hi>the chiefe of all the people of the Land,
Rulers, and Nobles, Princes of the chiefe Houſes among the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
of our Nation,</hi> it is expected both by God and men, that
ye ſhould do more for God in the advancement of his glory, and in
a more publike way, than others that are of inferiour ranke, and
ſtand at farther diſtance from him. Ye have the advantage by the
eminency of your place to contribute more, and ye are more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:113095:19"/>
ye have a larger portion in the bleſſing, and ye are the firſt
in the Covenant;<note place="margin">Numb. 7. 2. 1 Chr. 29. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Wee Noble-men, Barons, &amp;c.</hi> It will bee
greatly to your Honour, if as God hath honoured you above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
ye ſhall honour him more than they: If ye ſhall <hi>offer
first,</hi> firſt offer your owne ſelves to the Lord, a living ſacrifice,
holy, and acceptable; and then in your ſphear, and according to
your power, do honourably for God, who hath done gloriouſly for
us all.</p>
            <p>My Lords, <hi>The matters of God</hi> are before you, as well as the
affairs of the Common-wealth: It is humbly prayed, that they
may have the precedency and paſſe before, at leaſt in a line paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel,
and in even equipage with the concernments of men.</p>
            <p>The time was, and it was not long ſince, when all the heat and
zeal of men burnt out on their own hearth, <hi>and the coals thereof,
were as the coals of fire, which hath a moſt vehement flame;</hi>
their rage and their jealouſie was cruell as the grave; A man was
made an offender for a word, and drawn into judgment preſently,
heavy fines impoſed, and executions done with cruelty. True it
it is we cryed out of the oppreſſion; and the wiſdome and the
juſtice of this <hi>Honourable Parliament</hi> ſaw cauſe to remove thoſe
Arbitrary Judicatures <hi>of Honour, Star-chamber, and High-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,</hi>
and we rejoyced in the breaking of thoſe yokes. But
yet we ſee, there may ſometimes happen occaſions that may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken
Authority, to do ſomething exemplary for the vindicating
of the names and reputations of men, even there where ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
may be pleaded, if not in excuſe or extenuation of the words
or actions, yet in favour of the perſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ego certè ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reor, ne nos quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que, cum alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas blaſphemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as iterum atque iterum repeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, noſtram mentem pollua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, atque ita condemnatione quoque partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pemus. <hi>Baſil. 2 Tim.</hi> 3. 16.</note> The name of God is blaſphemed daily, He hath
been charged to be the Author of ſin, of the anomie of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe
of ſin; Bleſſed be God, ye have ſhewed your deteſtation
of the blaſphemy; He is denied to be that which himſelfe ſaith
he is, the myſtery of the Holy Trinity, that other great Goſpel-myſtery
of godlineſſe or God manifeſt in the fleſh, is openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cried,
derided. I tremble at the moſt execrable blaſphemies which
have bin belched out of the mouth of that <hi>Beast,</hi> and dare not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
them in the Pulpit, they would not be once named amongſt
Chriſtians. The authority of the holy Scriptures, <hi>given by inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of God,</hi> is not only queſtioned and diſputed, but perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorily
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:113095:20"/>
denied and gainſayd. The moſt ſacred and fixed Articles
and Principles of Faith are ſhaken, and loſe their reverence. The
Goſpel is blended with errours of vain men deceiving, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
not the <hi>ſeamleſſe Coat</hi> only of our Saviour, but his <hi>very
Body</hi> is divided and torn by Schiſme and Factions: There ſpring
up daily many roots of bitterneſſe, and many are thereby defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
There be ſcoffers, and prophane perſons, and Atheiſts, and
many are daily made ſuch, and great occaſion is given to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the Lord to blaſpheme, and to ſpeak evil of the way of
Truth, by thoſe who privily bring in damnable Hereſies, and by
thoſe who follow their pernicious wayes, uſing liberty for an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to the fleſh. Theſe things, <hi>and the like,</hi> are done daily, to
the great diſhonour of God, and ſcandall of Religion. I beſeech
you, <hi>my Lords,</hi> ſtirre up your jealouſie, and take hold upon your
power, for the puniſhing, the avenging, and the redreſſing of
theſe things. Be very jealous for God, <hi>who is jealous for his
people with a great jealouſie;</hi> that there may be no colour of
cauſe given for the renewing of the old complaint; All men
ſeeks their own, not the things which are Jeſus Chriſts.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is humbly deſired, that the worke of <hi>Reformation</hi>
may be ſpeeded, and order in the Church eſtabliſhed by Law, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
now while the Lord is thus advancing the worke of our <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance;</hi>
although there be many difficulties, and an appearance
of ſome diſcouragements.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Lordſhips</hi> may pleaſe to remember, how while the fire
was yet on the Buſh, two or three dayes before they were to paſſe
out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> when the people muſt needs bee in an hurry and
confuſion, in no fit diſpoſition, ſcarce a capacity of receiving
ſuch a Law, and there was no time to teach them the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

nigh at hand, and might well have been waited for the introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of the uſe, and regulating of the manner of communicating
in ſuch a myſtery: yet even in that juncture of time, and before
God offered to ſhew the whole patern in the Mount, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Paſſeover was inſtituted, and the rule thereof made
publike by an Ordinance, and the people commanded to obſerve
it;<note place="margin">Exod. 12.</note> 
               <hi>and they went, and were obedient thereunto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſeems to me, and I beleeve <hi>your Honours</hi> cannot think other,

            <p>For your Lordſhips may alſo pleaſe to call to minde, how
when the people wandered in the Wilderneſſe, neer fourty years
before they poſſeſſed the Land, The Lord cauſed the Tabernacle
of the T<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſtimony to be wrought and reared, and ordered the
pitching of it, and marſhalled the Tents of the Tribes about it,
and gave the Lawes for his publike worſhip; and in that unſetled
time, and when they were newly entred into <hi>Canaan,</hi> while
they were yet in warre, ſet on foot all that belonged to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of it.</p>
            <p>And afterwards, how it was the care of <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi>
in the <hi>moſt troubleſome times,</hi> when they had many enemies, and
there were many conſpiracies and confederacies againſt them,
and the diſtraction was great, and they were forced to hold a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:113095:21"/>
ſword in one hand, while a Trowell was in the other, yet made
it their great care to re-edifie the holy Citie and the Temple,
and reforme and reſtore the publike ſervice of God: and when
they entred into a curſe and an oath,<note place="margin">Neh 10. 19, 30 31, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>Reformation in matters of
Religion,</hi> was the firſt and principall charge. And when they
waxed cold, or forgetfull, the Prophets put them in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
they received the exhortation, and the Lord bleſſed the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of their love: <hi>Then the Prophets propheſied unto the Jewes
which were in Jeruſalem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezra 5. 1, 2. Hagg<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>in the name of the God of Iſrael; and
the Elders of the Jewes builded, and they proſpered through the
propheſying of Haggai the Prophet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezra 6. 14.</note> 
               <hi>and Zechariah the ſonne of
Iddo; and they builded and finiſhed it, according to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
of the Lord.</hi> There is my warrant for this motion,
and there is <hi>your Honours</hi> paterne for the worke, and there is
great encouragement to us all. I move you, <hi>my Lords,</hi> to no
more than what ye your ſelves have obliged your ſelves by ſolemn
Covenant to do, and what you have engaged us all to endeavour
and procure, by all good and lawfull means to be done; and this
brings to minde.</p>
            <p>A third thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>The keeping of the Covenant</hi> in the whole,
and in every part, eſpecially that which concerns <hi>the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Church, according to the Word of God, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of the best reformed Churches.</hi> I ſuppoſe I may be bold,
and that without offence, to transfer hither the ſpeech of <hi>Peter</hi>
to <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> in another caſe, or at the leaſt to allude
to it; When the ſuper-inducing of ſuch a ſacred ingagement was
firſt in motion, it was free to the <hi>high and Honourable Court
of Parliament,</hi> to have forborne the framing of ſuch a Covenant:
And while it remained under debate and deliberation, was it not
in your power to have abſtained from the bringing of your ſelves
and the Kingdomes into ſuch an oath and a curſe? but now yee
have ſworne before the Lord, how ſo great a part as the intended
Reformation can be kept back, or be rigidly preſſed for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the civill State, and neglected, or be proceeded in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mifly,
in the caſe of Religion and the Church, without tempting
or provoking the Lord; that I may not ſay without Sacriledge
or a lye unto God, judge ye? Or how ſafe it may be, after vowes
to make inquiry?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:113095:21"/>
How ſad a thing and deſtructive would it be, if the Land
ſhould after all this be made to mourne for breach of Covenant
and perjury?</p>
            <p>I beſeech you, <hi>my Lords,</hi> prevent it with all your zeale, and the
Lord enable you to do worthily for God, to do ſomething extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
for him, who hath done mervailouſly for the Kingdom,
exceeding abundantly above all that we have asked, or thought:
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto him be glory in the Church by Chriſt Jeſus, world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
end, Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There remaineth yet another Uſe to be made of this priviledge
and advantage of an extraordinary Providence;<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 3.</note> I will brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſpatch it in a few words of exhortation.</p>
            <p>1. To contentedneſſe with cheerfulneſſe under the mighty
hand of God, that ye may poſſeſſe your ſouls in your patience, and
be able to cleave to the Lord without diſtraction.</p>
            <p>We may be happy in adverſity: why ſhould we make our ſelves
miſerable by falſe fears, and falſe apprehenſions? we cannot run
from the fire if we would: why do we diſquiet our ſelves in vain?
were it not better to walk with God, in it, and follow the Lord
fully? It is an extraordinary priviledge to live under an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Providence: there cannot be ſuch an extraordinary Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
if all things move in the ordinary way, there muſt bee
change and trouble; and how ſhall we hope to receive the good
of it at the hands of God, if we be unwilling to receive the evil
alſo? The worke which the Lord hath begun to do, both in Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
and Judgement, is very great and manifold: upon what
ground, or to what end can we thinke or wiſh it may be finiſhed
in a day? <hi>He that beleeveth, maketh not haſte.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God will certainly glorifie himſelfe, and make his power
knowne, and get him a great Name; why ſhould not we deſire
to ſee the glory of God, though we therefore muſt be ſet in
ſtraits, and under a cloud, and the hand of God be upon us?</p>
            <p>The Lord hath prepared his Throne, and hath begun to pull
down <hi>Babylon,</hi> and to avenge the bloud of his Saints, and of all
that are ſlain on the earth. How ſhall their ſin ſwell up to its ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and they be ripe for the Judgement, ſo as all the World
ſhall confeſſe, <hi>True and righteous are thy Judgements, oh Lord;</hi>
if the meane while the people of God, and the Kingdomes of the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:113095:22"/>
World ſuffer nothing grievous by them; who would not be glad
to live when God doth this?</p>
            <p>The Lord is refining of his Church, as Gold is refined, it muſt
be done in the Furnace of affliction: He is purging them from
their filth, and he will do it by the Spirit of Judgement, and by
the Spirit of burning.<note place="margin">Eſay 4. 4.</note> Now we know that chronicall diſeaſes,
muſt have long and redious cures; where they have long been ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
upon the lees, they muſt be often rolled from veſſell to veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
and when they hang upon the old haunt, they muſt be whipe
off: and if this may be the fruit of it to take away our ſins, that
we periſh not in them; wherefore ſhould we make it our feare,
and not rather count it a mercy to ſuffer the tryall? God is come
down to redeem his Church, there muſt be time and occaſion for
him tobring forth all his great Judgements, &amp; multiply his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
that his people may have many teſtimonies of his neernes to
them, many pledges of his faithfulneſſe, for the ſupport of their
confidence and hope, that they may be convinced of, and humbled
under their weakneſſe, unworthineſſe, wretchedneſſe, and learne
to depend on God alone, and give him all the glory, that they
may have the proofe of the grace of God working effectually in
them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their patience may have its perfect worke, that they
may be entire, and made fit for deliverance, their hearts prepared
and eſtabliſhed to receive, and weare it with all thankfulneſſe, to
the praiſe of the glory of the grace of God. And if this be the
good of tribulation, why ſhould we not be willing to chuſe, with
<hi>Moſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 25.</note> to ſuffer affliction with the people of God? or to ſay
with <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 17. 4.</note> in admiration of the happineſſe, <hi>It is good being
here?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Micha 7. 9.</note> Or at the leaſt to reſolve with <hi>Micah,</hi> to bear the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Lord? (If we will needs ſo looke upon it) and
with <hi>H<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>bakkuk</hi> rejoyce in the God of our ſalvation;<note place="margin">Hab. 3. 17.</note> although
we ſhall be brought into extream deſolation, and never ſo
great affliction be prepared; if haply he will plead our cauſe, and
we may be brought forth to the light, and ſhall behold his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
and walk upon our high-places? rather than pray with
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 9. 28.</note> Let there be no more thundering and haile.</p>
            <p>We have made many prayers and ſupplications, it becomes us
now to wait (as the Husband-man) for the harveſt of our hopes,<note place="margin">James 5. 7, 8.</note>
and have long patience for <hi>the raine,</hi> as well as <hi>the Sun-ſhine;</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:113095:22"/>
that all things may be the more kindly ripened, and the more ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
gathered in, and threſhed out and ſed upon, to the more
advantage of our bleſſedneſſe; and in due time we ſhall reape if
we faint not: <hi>Be patient therefore, and ſtabliſh your heares,
for the comming of the Lord draweth nigh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That we may attain to theſe things, ſuffer me to
adde another word of exhortation, and then I ſhall have done;
it is to prayer, Firſt, that the Lord would give us an heart to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
and eyes to ſee, and ears to heare, <hi>while God dwells a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us in good will;</hi> that we may have the happineſſe to
finde the honey in the carcaſe, the wiſdome not to ſuck the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of Malignity, and male-contentedneſſe to our ruine, but to
extract the ſweet, the good, the righteouſneſſe that may be learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by judgements for our Reformation, and edification unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
This would make us count <hi>that</hi> bleſſedneſſe, that we now
call miſery; for not affliction, but the folly of him that ſuffers
it, is evil. But we cannot finde out the Riddle, unleſſe we plough
with Gods heifers:<note place="margin">James 1. 5.</note> Wherefore, <hi>if any man want the Wiſdome,
let him aske is of God, who gives to all men liberally, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braideth
not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, That while the fire taketh hold upon the Kingdoms,</hi>
The good will of him that dwelt in the Buſh, may come abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
upon us, <hi>who are many wayes ſeparated from other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
A motion for prayer is ſeaſonable in a day of thankſgiving;</hi>
This is the day which the Lord hath made,<note place="margin">Pſal. 18. 24.</note> we will rejoyce and
be glad in it. Save now I beſeech thee, oh Lord; oh Lord, I
beſeech thee ſend now proſperity. <hi>And truly we ſhall not pray
before we have need.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know no reaſon we have to flatter our ſelves with a golden
dreame of ſudden or ſetled peace; I am ſure our ſins do multiply
and increaſe, and ſo do our dangers too; If the ſword of Warre
were ſheathed again, we are in hazard to be ruined by that drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſſe
wherewith the Lord hath filled the Land, to periſh by
diviſion, ſchiſme, and faction: in this diſtemper, if we had no
warre, yet there would be no peace; and if he daſh us one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
another, and not pity, nor ſpare, nor have mercy, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
us, who can plead againſt him? The Lord knowes how to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliver
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:113095:23"/>
the godly out of temptation,<note place="margin">Pet. <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

and the preſent froward generation periſh by the way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I thinke therefore there is need to pray, and to pray daily,</hi> to
ſeeke the Lord,<note place="margin">Amos 5. 6.</note> that we live, <hi>leſt he that now dwells amongſt us
in good will, as when he dwelt in the Buſh,</hi> breake out like fire
in the Land, <hi>as he threatens the houſe of</hi> Joſeph, and devour<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
it, and there be none to quench it. The Lord is an holy God, he
is a jealous God,<note place="margin">Joſh. 24. 19, 20</note> and will not forgive our tranngreſſions: if we
abuſe the goodneſſe of God, and ſeek liberty for our lusts, and
forſake the Lord; He will turn, and doe us hurt, and conſume
us, after he hath done us good: And it may come to paſſe, that
as all good things are come upon us,<note place="margin">cap. 23. 25.</note> which the Lord our God hath
promiſed us, ſo he may bring upon us all evil things, untill he
hath destroied us from off this good land, which the Lord our
God hath given us.</p>
            <p>Nay, if we knew the ſecrets of God concerning us, or could
underſtand by books (as <hi>Daniel</hi> did) the ſet time of our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,
yet we ought to ſeek by prayer and ſupplication: How
much more, while the fire is yet on the Buſh, ſhould we cry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
to our God, after the example of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that we may
behold his Salvation? And now while we are together, and the
Lord hath put it into our hearts to pray before him; (for, bleſſed
be God, we may now pray after the Sermon, and are not bound
up to a doxologie, no not on a day of thankſgiving;) Let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
it in our Prayers.</p>
