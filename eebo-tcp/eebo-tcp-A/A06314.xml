            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>By the Maſter, Wardens and Aſsiſtants of the
Companie of Ship-wrights.</head>
            <p>VVHereas the remiſneſſe of former Gouernors in executing the ordinances eſtabliſhed for
the well gouernment of the Corporation, and their forbearance to leauy the fines impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
for breach of orders, according to his Maieſties charge, and the ordinances thereupon made,
makes many perſons, eſpecially of the better ſort, inſolent in their cariage and remiſſe in their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
and notwithſtanding that we who are now Gouernors, with a ioynt conſent are in hand to
redreſſe thoſe grieuances which themſelues complained of, and that many of them are eyewitneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
what good entrance we haue already made, in reforming of many diſorders, and particularly
for reliefe of the poore, and reſtraining the abuſe of keeping exorbitant numbers of ſeruants, yet
many do ſtill perſiſt in their obſtinacie, ſuppoſing and reporting that our paines and preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie
is but a blaze which will ſoone vaniſh.</p>
            <p>But we thinke it fit to let all men know, that forſomuch as a courſe is now ſetled by order of law
for diſcharge and paiment of the Companies debts, which did heretofore hinder and diſtract all
good proceedings, we do intend by Gods aſſiſtance (according to our dutie and oath) to go on
in the effectuall ſetling of his Maieſties charge and ordinances within the riuer of Thames and
Medway, and in reforming of all abuſes and diſorders contrary thereunto. And becauſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
workmen are wholy freed from paiment of the Companies debts, and are neuer henceforth
to be charged or burthened with any more taxes or other impoſitions beſides the ordinary duties
of quarterage, admittance, preſentments, and fines for breach of orders (according as is vſuall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all other Companies:) we are to let them know, that from henceforth a more ſtricter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
ſhall be taken of their irregular courſes then hath been heretofore, and that we will proceed
in managing the truſt committed to vs without partialitie or ſparing of any perſon whatſoeuer;
and therefore we do hereby ſignifie vnto them and all others whom it concernes, that whoſoeuer
from the firſt day of May next comming, ſhall offend in the wilfull breach of any ordinance of the
Companie, ſhall be ſure to be cenſured and his fine leuied, without any fauour or conniuence; and
hereof it is that we would haue euery one to take notice, for which purpoſe this order is printed
and appointed to be ſet vp in euery mans Yard, that no man may pretend ignorance, eſpecially in
theſe ſix points following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1. That whoſoeuer hath formerly bound or enrolled his Apprentice at London or elſewhere, and brings
not his Indenture to the Clerke of the Companie to be regiſtred according to his Maieſties charge betwixt
this and the firſt day of May next comming, ſhal be ſure to pay his fine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>2. That whoſoeuer from the ſixt of Ianuary laſt (at which time it was ordered and publike notice giuen)
hath retained or ſhall hereafter keep or retain aboue the number of two Apprentices, limited in the ordinance
for that purpoſe, ſhall pay his fine of 5 <abbr>l.</abbr> without any further fauour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>3. That whoſoeuer comes not to the Hall or place of meeting, vpon the firſt or ſecond warning or ſummons
by the Beadle or Officer of the Company, ſhall be ſent for by a meſſenger, and pay his fine and the meſſengers
fees before he be diſcharged of his arreſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>4. That whoſoeuer bindes his Apprentiſe any where elſe then at the Hall, ſhall pay his fine of 40 <hi>s<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi>
without fauour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>5. That whoſoeuer goes to Sea, and comes not firſt to the Hall to haue his ſufficiencie approued and to
regiſter his name according to the ordinance in that behalfe, ſhall be fined accordingly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>6. That whatſoeuer Yard keeper or other ſhall ſet any ſtranger to worke, contrary to the ordinance in
that behalfe, or ſhall imploy or continue in worke any perſon whatſoeuer or his ſeruant that is refractory to
the Company, after warning giuen, ſhall pay the fine limited for that offence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the better keeping of good order, it is thought fit, that whoſoeuer ſhall be from henceforth
made free of the Companie, ſhall take out a copie of his freedome vnder ſeale, without ſhewing
whereof no man to ſet him aworke.</p>
            <p>Alſo, that whoſoeuer from henceforth ſhall take any ſeruant, ſhall haue a warrant vnder ſeale,
limiting how many apprentiſes he ſhall keepe, and his apprentiſes names to be endorſed vpon the
warrant, to the end we may be ſure to keepe all men within compaſſe.</p>
            <p>We deſire the ſecond Aſſiſtants, and euery man elſe that heares of any ſtranger ſet to worke, or
any one that keepes aboue the number he ought to keepe, or of any man that works for himſelfe
and hath not ſerued his time, or marries before his time be expired, or of any other abuſe or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
fit to be redreſſed, to giue notice to the Beadle or Officer of the Companie, who for that
purpoſe is appointed once euery fortnight to go through all the Yards in the Riuer.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, if any perſons of the Company do find themſelues agrieued in any thing, let them come
in an orderly faſhion and preſent their grieuances in writing, and they ſhall expect we will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to do them all the right and iuſtice that can be reaſonably required.</p>
            <closer>God ſaue the King.</closer>
