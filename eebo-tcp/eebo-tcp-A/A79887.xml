            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was at your requeſt that I firſt preached this Sermon; and it is more to ſatisfie your deſires than mine own, that I now print it. They that know me, cannot but withall know how backward I have ever been (being conſcious to my own weakneſſe) to publiſh any of my labours in this kind; and your ſelves can bear me witneſs, that it was my earneſt requeſt, that you would have laid this burthen upon abler ſhoulders, eſpecially ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo great choiſe of godly and learned <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> whom you invited to the Funeral: But when you perſevered in your deſires and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts
<pb facs="tcp:119443:3"/>
to me to undertake it, my chiefeſt care was to make choiſe of ſuch a ſubject, as (through Gods bleſſing) might come home to your hearts, and direct your behaviour under ſo great a burthen, as is the loſſe of a dear and and only Son. I knew that your affections were ſtrong, and that you had need of a great deal of heavenly wiſdom to enable you to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate them; and whence is this wiſdom to be learned, but from the ſacred Scriptures, which are richly ſtored with precious promiſes, as with ſo many cordials to revive and ſtrengthen us in our greateſt neceſſities. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs thy Law</hi> (faith <hi>David,</hi> meaning principally the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes contained in it) <hi>had been my delights, I ſhould have periſhed in mine affliction,</hi> Pſal. 119. 92. But as thoſe which are faln into a ſwoon, may be fetched again with hot waters poured down their throats: ſo they that are troubled and preſſed down under the heavy burthen of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and grief, may by patience and comfort of the Scriptures recover hope and joy.</p>
            <p>The Text which God directed me to treat of was both ſeaſonable and ſuitable to your preſent condition; as not onely teaching you how to behave your ſelves under ſuch an affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb facs="tcp:119443:3"/>
but holding forth to you ſound and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient arguments to perſwade and induce you to the practice of the ſame: I beſeech you therefore to read it over and over again, and remember what the Father ſaid; theſe are <hi>Verba vivenda, &amp; non legenda ſolùm,</hi> words to be lived and practiſed, and not to be read only: Such a ſentence it is as a man would fetch from <hi>China</hi> upon his bare feet, rather than be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. Take, I pray you, your correction as from Gods hand, and humble your ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſmart of it: yet withal look to Chriſt, and entreat him that your Faith, Hope, and meekneſſe may not be overturned by it, but rather that the affliction may <hi>bring forth Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Patience Experience, and Experience Hope.</hi> Conſider who it is that hath done it: Is he not your heavenly Father? Now if your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Father had done ſome ſhrewd turn at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares, by breaking a thing wherein you much delighted, when you heard that he did it, you would be quiet, though before you were much moved: Should you not ſay with Chriſt? <hi>Shall I not drink of that cup, that my Father will have me to drink of?</hi> Remember, I pray you, what the Apoſtle ſuggeſteth, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. 9. <hi>We</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:119443:4"/>
               <hi>have had Fathers of our fleſh that have corrected us, and we gave them reverence: Shall we not much rather be in ſubjection to the Father of our Spirits, and live?</hi> v. 10. <hi>For they verily for a few days chaſtned us after their own pleaſure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holineſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider, I pray you, if God when you were firſt married ſhould have told you, I will give you two children, and you ſhall bring them up ſo many years, and then I will take them away again; would you not have accepted gladly of this offer, and taken it thankfully too? why? the event doth tell you no leſſe than if he had ſpoken ſo afore-hand, and will you now mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur or repine at his diſpenſation? Is not God the chief Father of all the Families in Heaven and Earth, and we but Foſter-parents to our own children under him? Is it not a mercy that God hath made you inſtrumentall for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging of his Kingdom, though he hath taken both your children from you? Say therefore with <hi>Job, The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken away, bleſſed be the Name of the Lord.</hi> At leaſt ſay with <hi>David, I was dumb, and opened not my mouth, becauſe thou Lord didſt it.</hi> Oh! la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb facs="tcp:119443:4"/>
for good old <hi>Eli's</hi> temper, <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what ſeems good in his eyes,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 18. Conſider that God who hath done it, is <hi>Love,</hi> and if you look upon it as an effect of his anger towards you, yet be of good comfort, that God that would not have ſinful man to let the Sun go down upon his anger, <hi>he will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his anger for ever, becauſe he delighteth in mercy,</hi> Micha. 7. 18.</p>
            <p>But I preſume that one thing addes a great ſting to your affliction, which is, that hereby you want an Heir to enjoy your Eſtate, and to preſerve your name: for all men naturally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect immortality, and becauſe they cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it in themſelves, they deſire it in their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity that ſurvives them: But for a medicine to this malady, remember what the Lord ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 3, 4, 5 <hi>Let not the Eunuch ſay, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I am a dry tree. For thus ſaith the Lord to the Eunuchs that keep my Sabbath, &amp; chooſe the things that pleaſe me, and take hold of my Covenant; even unto them will I give in my houſe, and within my walls, a place and a name better than of ſons and of daughters, I will give tbem an everlaſting name that ſhall not be cut off.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let me but adde one word more, and I have
<pb facs="tcp:119443:5"/>
done; Conſider what a mercy it is, that God hath given you ſo many Chriſtian friends that ſympathize with you, and help to bear your burthen; ſo many godly and able comforters to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to your afflicted ſouls, ſo many faithful Miniſters and Chriſtians that daily pray for you, and beg of God that he will ſupport you under this heavy loſſe, and make it up in ſome better bleſſing. Remember, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, what our <hi>Lord</hi> and Saviour Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 26. <hi>If any one come unto me, and hates not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and ſiſters, yea and his own life alſo, he cannot be my Diſciple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the God of comfort be your comforter, and give you a large meaſure of prudence, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſelf-denial, with a full and free reſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſelf, to the abſolute diſpoſal of the All-wiſe and All-merciful God, that you may as well in heart, as in words ſay, <hi>Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven,</hi> which is the ſervent prayer of</p>

            <p>In theſe two verſes of my text, the chiefeſt ſcope of the Apoſtle is to perſwade them to keep a mean in their mourning for the dead; wherein are conſiderable,</p>
            <p>Firſt, the friendly compellation that he uſes, <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, An information concerning the ſtate of the dead, ſet down negatively, <hi>I would not have you ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, I would have you well infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of this Doctrine, the knowledge whereof will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce much to your comfort.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the end why he was ſo careful to inform them of it, that they might not <hi>ſorrow, as did o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which had no hope, viz.</hi> as the Heathen did: For although they believed the immortality of the ſoul, yet they were never able to comprehend or believe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the bodies, and re-uniting them with the ſouls, whereof he ſpeaks in the ſubſequent verſe, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 32. and 26. 23, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, a ſtrong argument to inforce his exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for their moderate mourning for the dead, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>For if we believe that Jeſus died and roſe again, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus having heard the occaſion and ſcope of theſe words, and the principal parts of the Text, I will make no other curious diviſion of it, but proceed to ſhew you how many uſeful obſervations may be gathered out of theſe verſes: and Firſt, from the friendly compellation uſed by the Apoſtle, <hi>Brethren.</hi> Whence note firſt, that,</p>
            <p>All Gods children are brethren; ſo ſaith <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Lot, Gen.</hi> 13. 8. <hi>Let there be no ſtrife, I pray-thee, between</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Doct.</note> 
               <hi>me and thee, &amp;c. for we are brethren:</hi> ſo <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 2. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 26, 27. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6 2. For</p>
            <p>Firſt, they are the adopted children of the ſame Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 6.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:119443:7"/>
Secondly, they are born of the ſame mother, the Church, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They are brought up in the ſame Family, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 15.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, They are nouriſhed with the ſame food, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, They have all the ſame inheritance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Again, conſider who it is that calls them <hi>brethren,</hi> the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> the great Doctor of the Gentiles, and a man endowed with more then ordinary gifts and graces: and who they were that he calls <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;</hi> the lately converted <hi>Theſsalonians:</hi> moſt of them of mean rank, and mean gifts, in compariſon of him: whence note,</p>
            <p>They which have the greateſt gifts and graces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon them by God, muſt not ſuperciliouſly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlook <note place="margin">Doct.</note> thoſe which are meaner and weaker then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but muſt own them for, and acknowledge them to be <hi>Brethren</hi> Hence, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>who makes thee to differ from another? and what haſt thou that thou didſt not receive? Now if thou didſt receive it, why doeſt thou glory, as if thou hadſt not received it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, in that the Apoſtle was ſo careful to inform them of this comfortable truth; Obſerve,</p>
            <p>Gods Miniſters muſt be careful to inform their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all ſuch ſaving truths as may conduce to their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification <note place="margin">Doct.</note> and comfort: that when they come to leave their people, they may be able to ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 27. <hi>I have not ſhunned to declare unto you all the counſel of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, It ſeems that till now the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> were ignorant of theſe things which made them to over-ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for their dead. Hence obſerve:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:119443:7"/>
Ignorance of the bleſſed eſtate of the Saints departed <note place="margin">Doct.</note> is the cauſe of exceſſive mourning for them.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the dead, ſaith, They were <hi>aſleep,</hi> Hence obſerve:</p>
            <p>The death of the righteous is but a ſweet ſleep: ſo it <note place="margin">Doct.</note> is often called in Scripture. Chriſt ſpeaking of dead <hi>Lazarus,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Our friend Lazarus ſleepeth, Joh.</hi> 11. 11. with 14. and when <hi>Stephen</hi> was ſtoned to death, its ſaid, <hi>that he fell aſleep, Act.</hi> 7. 60. and in theſe two verſes of my Text, <hi>Paul</hi> twice calls it a ſleep: and hence the grave is called a <hi>Bed, Iſa.</hi> 572. and the <hi>Greeks</hi> called it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a Dormitory, or ſleeping place.</p>
            <p>Sixthly. <hi>I would not have you ſorrow as do others, &amp;c.</hi> He doth not ſay, I would not have ſorrow at all: For, its a duty to mourn for the dead: For as a reverend and learned Doctor ſaith, ſorrow and lamentation is the <note place="margin">Dr, <hi>Tuck</hi>
               </note> dues of the dead. It is fit that the body, when its ſown in corruption, ſhould be watered with the tears of them that plant it in the earth, and to be without natural af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections is an Heatheniſh ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 31. and one of thoſe that make theſe later times perilous, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 3. From whence we may obſerve:</p>
            <p>Its lawful to mourn and ſorrow upon the death of our <note place="margin">Doct.</note> friends and relations. Our Lord Chriſt himſelf wept at the death of <hi>Lazarus, Joh.</hi> 11. 35. And the Church made great lamentation for <hi>Stephen, Act.</hi> 8. 2. And the widdows wept for <hi>Dorcas, Act.</hi> 9. 39. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed when <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> was deadly ſick, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 27.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, <hi>As do others that have no hope,</hi> i. e. as the Heathen do, which are ignorant of theſe things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hence,</p>
            <p>The Heathen uſe to be immoderate in their mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the dead; becaue they want a hope of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <note place="margin">Doct.</note> bleſſedneſſe of their ſouls, and the future reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119443:8"/>
of their bodies. Forbidden Gods people, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 27, 28.</p>
            <p>Eightly, But I would not have you do ſo, ſaith the Apoſtle. Hence,</p>
            <p>Chriſtians which know theſe things muſt be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <note place="margin">Doct.</note> in their mourning.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, Verſ. 14. <hi>For if we believe, that Jeſus died and roſe again, &amp;c.</hi> Hence obſerve, firſt;</p>
            <p>The reſurrection of Chriſts body from the dead is a ſure and certain pledge and evidence of the reſurrection <note place="margin">Doct.</note> of out bodies: So the holy Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> makes it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 12, &amp;c. <hi>If Chriſt be preached, that he roſe from the dead, how ſay ſome among you, that there is no reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the dead: But if there be no reſurrection of the dead, then Chriſt is not riſen:</hi> and <hi>verſe</hi> 20. <hi>But now is Chriſt riſen from the dead, and become the firſt fruits of them that slept, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tenthly, <hi>Even ſo them alſo which sleep in Jeſus.</hi> Hence obſerve.</p>
            <p>That the bodies of the Saints departed ſleep in the arms of <hi>Jeſus:</hi> He takes care of all the bones, yea, of <note place="margin">Doct.</note> the very duſt of his Saints, that none of it ſhall be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting when he comes to raiſe their bodies again at the laſt day. Our bodies, even whilſt they lie in the grave, are members of Chriſt; and therefore its no marvel, though he takes ſuch care of them.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, <hi>Will God bring with him.</hi> Whence I gather.</p>
            <p>That when Chriſt ſhall come to judgment, then ſhall the reſurrection of our bodies be: This is an Article of <note place="margin">Doct.</note> our faith. It was typified by the budding and bloſſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Aarons</hi> dry rod: By <hi>Jonas</hi> deliverance out of the belly of the Fiſh, where he had been three dayes and three nights. It was believed by the Patriarchs of old,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119443:8"/>
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13. And its an infallible truth, that theſe bodies of ours <hi>that are ſown in corruption, ſhall be raiſed in incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 42. And for our further ſecurity, <hi>Enoch</hi> before the flood, and <hi>Elijah</hi> after the flood, were taken into heaven in their bodies.</p>
            <p>Neither indeed is this contrary to reaſon, though it be above the reach of reaſon: For why cannot Chriſt as well raiſe a body out of the duſt, as at firſt he made it out of the duſt? eſpecially conſidering that the ſoul is preſerved in heaven for this very end, to be joyned to the body again. This <hi>Job</hi> was confident of, <hi>Job</hi> 19. 26, 27. <hi>Though after my skin wormes deſtroy this body, yet in my fleſh I ſhall ſee God, &amp;c.</hi> Nay, its not contrary to the courſe of nature: For we yearly ſee that the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Spring ſucceeds the dead Winter, the day the night: and <hi>thou fool,</hi> the corn <hi>that thou ſoweſt, is not quickned, except it die,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 36. and the ſame Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11. <hi>That if the Spirit that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead dwell in us, he that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead ſhall quicken our mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwells in us.</hi> Beſides, Chriſt is the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and as we did bear the image of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> in corruption, ſo we muſt bear the Image of the ſecond <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> in glory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15 22. 45, 49.</p>
            <p>Twelfthly, But that which is the principal thing that I intend to inſiſt on is a Doctrine held forth to us in the latter end of the fourteenth verſe, <hi>That ye ſorrow not as do others that have no hope:</hi> Whence,</p>
            <p>A well-grounded hope of the happineſſe of our friends deceaſed ſhould moderate our mourning for <note place="margin">Doct.</note> them. This (without queſtion) moderated <hi>Abrahams</hi> mourning for <hi>Sarah.</hi> Mourn indeed he did, for the text ſaith, <hi>Gen.</hi> 23. 2. that <hi>Sarah died—</hi>and <hi>Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her;</hi> but that he
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119443:9"/>
kept a mean in his mourning, appears by the next words, <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4. And <hi>Abraham ſtood up from before his dead,</hi> and beſpake a burying place to bury his dead out of his ſight; and this he did, that the object being removed, his ſorrow might be mitigated. This alſo moderated <hi>Joſephs</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> mourning for <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 50. 1. where it is ſaid, <hi>that Joſeph fell upon his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers face,</hi> (when he died) <hi>and wept upon him, and kiſsed him:</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. its ſaid, <hi>that Joſeph and the Iſraelites made a mourning for him ſeven dayes:</hi> but <hi>v.</hi> 3. Its ſaid, that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> (who mourned as men without hope) mourned for him <hi>threeſcore and ten dayes.</hi> This alſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated <hi>Davids</hi> mourning for his child, 2 <hi>Sam</hi> 12. 23. <hi>Now he is dead, wherefore ſhould I faſt? can I bring him back again? I ſhall go to him, but he ſhall not return to me:</hi> And this was <hi>Martha</hi>'s comfort, when her dear Brother <hi>Lazarus</hi> was dead, <hi>I know that he ſhall riſe again in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection at the laſt day, Joh.</hi> 11. 24.</p>
            <p>In the proſecution of this Point, I ſhall ſhew you, Firſt, what is meant by a well-grounded hope. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Wherein the happineſſe of our friends departed in the Lord, conſiſts. Thirdly, why the conſideration of theſe things ſhould put a mean to our mourning for them. Fourthly; I will anſwer ſome objections that may be made againſt it. And fifthly, make application of it.</p>
            <div type="question">
               <p>For the firſt:</p>
               <p>What do you call a well-grounded hope? <note place="margin">Queſt.</note>
               </p>
               <div type="answer">
                  <p>I uſe this Epithite, to diſtinguiſh it from that ill-grounded <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> hope wherewith ſo many do delude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. as</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe their friends were born of Chriſtian Parents, Baptized, and brought up in the Church.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe they had gotten ſome knowledge,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119443:9"/>
and made an outward profeſſion of Religion.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, becauſe they uſed to attend upon the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ordinances, and that with ſome ſeeming devotion.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Becauſe they were free from groſſe ſins, and dealt juſtly with every man.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Becauſe they enjoyed outward peace and proſperity, the Sun of God ſhining upon their Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Becauſe they died quietly like lambs, and it may be, went out of the world with ſome good words in their mouths, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 4, 5. <hi>There are no bands in their death, but their ſtrength is firm; they are not in trouble as other men.</hi> From theſe and ſuch like weak grounds, they preſume that their friends after death muſt needs go to heaven, and therefore they comfort themſelves, and one another with theſe words: whereas the truth is, they may go to Hell after all theſe things. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt tells us, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5. 20. that <hi>except our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe ſhall exceed the righteouſneſſe of the Scribes and Phariſees, we ſhall in no caſe enter into the Kingdome of Heaven:</hi> And theſe men are ſo far from exceeding, that they come ſhort of the righteouſneſſe of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who were frequent in Almſ-deeds, in prayer, in faſting, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 2. 5. 16. and yet Chriſt calls them hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites. Yea, they made long prayers, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 14. they compaſſed <hi>Sea and land to make one Proſelyte, v.</hi> 15. they payed even their ſmalleſt tithes, <hi>v.</hi> 23. They out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly appeared righteous unto men: <hi>v.</hi> 28. they bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their fathers for murthering the Prophets, and by way of compenſation to free themſelves from the guilt, they built <hi>Tombs for thoſe Prophets, and garniſhed the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres of the righteous, v.</hi> 29. 30. notwithſtanding all which, Chriſt pronounceth many woes againſt them.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee what are ill-grounded hopes, which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119443:10"/>
prove but like a ſpiders web to thoſe that truſt in them. I ſhall therefore in the next place ſhew you what is a well-grounded hope of the happineſſe of our friends de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, which conſiſts in this:</p>
                  <p>When our deceaſed friends have in their life-time gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us ſome good evidence of the work of grace and ſanctification wrought in their hearts, whereby we could diſcern that, by Gods bleſſing upon the means, <hi>their eyes were opened, that they were turned from darkneſſe to light, and from the power of Satan unto God:</hi> For then we may conclude, <hi>that they have received forgiveneſſe of their ſins and an inheritance amongſt them that are ſanctified by faith that is in Chriſt,</hi> Act. 26. 18.</p>
               </div>
            </div>
            <div type="objection">
               <p>But this work of grace being inward and ſecret, how ſhall we be able to judge of it? <note place="margin">Object.</note>
               </p>
               <div type="answer">
                  <p>Our Saviour Chriſt gives us a rule for our direction in judging of others, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. <hi>Ye ſhall know</hi>

                  <p>Now many ſignes might be given, whereby we may judge of the work of grace in others, but I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my ſelf for the preſent with theſe three.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, if living with them, we obſerve that they make conſcience of, and practiſe private and ſecret duties as well as publick. Hypocrites when they do duties, do all
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119443:10"/>
to be ſeen of men, that they may have <hi>glory of men, Matth.</hi> 6. 2. 5. 16. and therefore in their very private prayers they love to make them <hi>in the Synagogues, and in the corners of the ſtreets, v.</hi> 5. they have <hi>Jacobs</hi> voice, but <hi>Eſaus</hi> hands: the Lord indeed is much in their <hi>mouths, but far from their reines,</hi> Jer. 12. 2. they lay claim to Chriſt, but yet have no ſhare in him: they deeply affirm of him, but have no manner of right to him: their faith is but phanſie, their confidence but preſumption; they are like the mad man at <hi>Athens</hi> that laid claim to every ſhip that came into the Harbour, when he had no part in any; Like <hi>Haman,</hi> that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King would honour a man, concluded (but falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) that himſelf was the man: or like <hi>Siſera</hi> that drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of a Kingdome, whereas <hi>Jaels</hi> nail was neerer his temples then a crown: and thus they deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with their ſhews, and think to deceive others; but Gods children can uſually diſcern them, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them to be like Harpyes that are ſaid to have <hi>Virgins</hi> faces, but <hi>Vulturs</hi> talons: but on the contrary, a ſound-hearted Chriſtian, though he dare not neglect, yea, though he prefer the publick, yet he alſo makes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of private duties, and prayes to his Father in ſecret; ſo that if we obſerve this in them, its one good ground that they have the work of regeneration wrought in their hearts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if we obſerve them, that they labour to keep <hi>a conſcience void of offence both towards God, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men,</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſeth that he did, <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 16. If they have had <hi>reſpect to all Gods commandments,</hi> as <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119. 6. If they have made conſcience of the duties of both Tables, ſerving God <hi>in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe all the days of their lives, Luke</hi> 1. 75. hiring themſelves unto him for term of life, not deſiring to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119443:11"/>
change their Maſter, knowing that they cannot mend themſelves neither for fairneſſe of work, nor fulneſſe of wages, whereas an Hypocrite is <hi>verſutulus &amp; verſatilis,</hi> he caſts about how to deceive God and man with meer ſhews of devotion, being not afraid to be damned, ſo he may ſeem to be ſaved, and ſeeking ſo long to deceive others, that in fine he deceives his own ſoul. <hi>Impoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram faciunt &amp; patiuntur,</hi> as that Emperour ſaid of them that ſold glaſſe beads for pearl. They deceive, and are deceived.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when we have heard them groaning and mourning under the remainders of corruption, and the relicts of ſin, crying out with the holy Apoſtle, <hi>Rom</hi> 7. 24. <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death!</hi> When they have manifeſted their hatred againſt all ſin, and ſhunned every evil way, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the wiſeſt of men, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 13. <hi>the fear of the Lord is to hate evil; pride, and arrogancy, and every evil way do I hate:</hi> whereas a diſpenſatory conſcience is a naughty conſcience: Neither doth he Gods will, but his own, that doth no more nor no other then himſelf pleaſeth, as hypocrites uſe; ſuch holiday ſervants God cares not for. Every one can ſwim in a warm Bath, and every bird will ſing in a Summers-day. <hi>Judas</hi> will bear the Croſſe, ſo he may bear the bag: and the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Capernaits</hi> will follow Chriſt for the loaves, though not for love, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 26. But <hi>Abraham</hi> will forſake all to follow God, though he know not whither yea though God ſeems to go a croſs way, as when he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him a land flowing with milk and honey; and yet ſo ſoon as he came there, he met with a famine, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 10.</p>
                  <p>If then you have obſerved theſe three things in your Chriſtian friends whilſt they lived, you may have a well-grounded
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:119443:11"/>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, In the good things that they are put into the preſent poſſeſſion of: ſo that their happineſſe is both privative and poſitive.</p>

            </div>
            <div type="question">
               <p>What are the evils that they are freed from by death? <note place="margin">Queſt.</note>
               </p>
               <div type="answer">
                  <p>They may be reduced to theſe ſeven heads.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They are freed from worldly cares, buſineſſes, <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> and troubles. For its Gods inſtitution ſince the fall, that every one ſhall live, either by the ſweat of his brain, or by the ſweat of his brow. And <hi>Eliphaz</hi> tells us, <hi>that man is born to trouble, as the ſparks fly upward, Job</hi> 5. 7. and the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>that he that careth not for his own, and eſpecially for thoſe of his own houſe, he hath denied the Faith, and is worſe than an Infidel,</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 8. So then whilſt we live here, we cannot be free from multiplicity of cares, buſineſſes, and troubles. The world is like a tempeſtuous Sea, where troubles ſucceed one another, as one wave follows another.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>—Dolor &amp; voluptas</l>
                     <l>Invicem cedunt, brevior voluptas.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Joy and ſorrow (as one wittily ſaith) make chequer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed work in our lives: Sorrow bedews our cheeks with <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ought</hi>
                     </note> tears, and joy wipes them off again. Our condition in this life is not unlike to that of the Iſraelites in the wilderneſſe, where they met with many troubles, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and occaſions of ſorrow. Are we hurt then, if by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119443:12"/>
a tempeſt of ſickneſſe we are driven out of the Sea of this world into the ſafe harbour of the grave, the onely place <hi>where the weary are at reſt, Job</hi> 3. 17. <hi>where they enter into peace, and reſt in their beds,</hi> Iſa. 57. 2. For which cauſe amongſt others, they are pronounced bleſſed by God himſelf, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 13. <hi>Bleſsed are the dead which die in the Lord—for they reſt from their labours.</hi> Indeed the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of death is to moſt men and women very terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but to a dying believer, then acting faith, its no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo, but its entertained by him as a welcome meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger ſent from the Father to a child at nurſe, to bring it home, where it ſhall be better provided for, whilſt it tranſmits him from all his cares and ſorrowes into that place and ſtate of bliſſe where all tears ſhall be wiped from his eyes, and he ſhall never forrow more, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 4.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they are freed from the company and ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of the wicked, which (whilſt they lived) was a cauſe of much ſorrow to them, and that</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe of their ſins, which were a continual grief to their godly hearts. Hence <hi>David</hi> profeſſeth, that <hi>Rivers of waters ran down his eyes, becauſe men kept not Gods Law, Pſal,</hi> 119. 136. and the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> tells us <hi>that juſt Lot was vexed with the filthy converſation of the wicked. For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that righteous man dwelling amongſt them, in ſeeing &amp; hearing, vexed his righteous ſoul from day to day, with their unlawful deeds,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 7, 8 Gods children are ſo tender of their Fathers honour, that they cannot ſee, or hear his Name blaſphemed, his truths adultera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, his Sabbaths profaned, his Miniſters, and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces deſpiſed, &amp;c. but it goes like ſo many daggers to their hearts, neither can they be free from ſuch occaſions of ſorrow whileſt they continue in this wicked world, death only removes ſuch objects of grief from them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:119443:12"/>
Secondly, Becauſe of the wrongs, injuries, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions which they meet with from them Theſe Goats will be puſhing at Chriſts Sheep: ſometimes wounding them in their good names: ſometimes wronging them in their eſtates: and otherſometimes raiſing greater perſecutions againſt them. For the Apoſtle tells us, that this is the portion of all Gods children in this life; <hi>All that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhall ſuffer perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 12. and our Saviour Chriſt tells his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>that the time ſhould come, that whoſoever killed them ſhould think that he did God ſervice,</hi> Joh. 16. 2. Thus <hi>Cain</hi> perſecuted <hi>Abel: Iſmael, Iſaac:</hi> yea, which of the Prophets or Apoſtles did not the wicked of their times perſecute? This made <hi>David</hi> to cry out, <hi>Wo is me that I fojourn in Meſech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar. My ſoul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace,</hi> Pſal. 120. 5, 6. But now in the grave <hi>the wicked ceaſe from trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling. There the priſoners reſt together, and hear not the voice of the oppreſsour,</hi> Job 3. 17, 18.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Death frees them from evils to come, God herein dealing as Parents uſe, who have children forth at nurſe or at ſchool, when troubles or dangerous diſeaſes come into thoſe places where their children are, they ſend for them home, that they may be in ſafety. So God many times takes his children out of this world, that he may ſecure them from imminent dangers: Or as when our houſes are in danger of firing, we remove our treaſure and jewels in the firſt place into places of more ſecurity: So where God wrath, s like fire, is breaking in upon a place, he removes his children to heaven, as to a place of greater ſafety. Its the fathers love and care (ſaith one) then haſtily to ſnatch away his child, when the wilde Bull is now broken looſe, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Tuckney</hi>
                     </note> upon him. The wiſe Husband-man haſtens to get
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:119443:13"/>
in his corn before the ſtorm cometh, or the ſwine be turned out into the field to root up all. This is that which the Lord by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> long ſince aſſured us of, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 1. <hi>The righteous periſheth, and no man layeth it to heart; and merciful men are taken away, none conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come.</hi> As it was a ſign that <hi>Sampſon</hi> meant to pull down the houſe upon the heads of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> when he pulled down the Pillars that bare up the roof: So its a ſhrewd ſign that God intends to ruine a State, when he takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way thoſe that were the Pillars and props of it. When <hi>Methuſala</hi> died, the flood came upon the old world: when <hi>Joſias</hi> was gathered to his Fathers, the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> captivity haſtened. When <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> died, <hi>Hippo</hi> was taken and ſackt by the <hi>Vandals,</hi> and <hi>Heidleburg</hi> by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſhortly after the death of <hi>Pareus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Death frees them from all ſickneſſes, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, pains, and all other bodily diſtempers. It cures the blind eyes, the deaf ears, the dumb tongue, the lame legs, the maimed hands, &amp;c. It eaſeth the tormenting ſtone, the painful gout, the aking head, the intolerable twiſting of the guts, the loathſome ſtrangury, &amp;c. Death to the godly is the beſt Phyſician, it cures them not of one diſeaſe, but of all, and of all at once, and of all for ever; yea it cures them of death it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, it frees them from the fiery darts and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Satan, from which they cannot be free whilſt they live here: For the whole world is the Devils Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſſe: <hi>He goes to and fro in the earth, and walketh up and down in it, Job.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>yea, as a roaring lion he walketh about, ſeeking whom he may devour,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. No place can exempt us from his tentations whilſt we live in this world. He aſſaulted <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Paradiſe, Lot</hi> in the Cave, <hi>David</hi> in his Palace: <hi>Joſuah</hi> the high Prieſt, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:119443:13"/>
of the Angel of the Lord; Chriſt in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; <hi>Peter</hi> in the High Prieſts hall, &amp;c. But when Death comes, <hi>theſe Egyptians which you have ſeen to day, ye ſhall ſee them again no more for ever, Exod.</hi> 14. 13. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan ſhall never more moleſt Gods children after this life is ended. Hence, ſaith Saint <hi>Ambroſe, Diabolus per quod poteſtatem habuit, victus eſt.</hi> The Devil, who had the power of death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14. hath by death his power abrogated and aboliſhed.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Death frees them from Gods frowns, which ſin often expoſeth them to here, and which to a child of God is more terrible than death it ſelf: For if <hi>in Gods favour is life,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> affirms, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30. 5. then in his frowns is death.: yea, if Gods <hi>loving kindneſs is better than life,</hi> Pſal. 63. 3. then his frowns are worſe than death. There are no outward or corporal afflictions, but a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and <hi>Roman</hi> ſpirit will ſtand under them: <hi>the ſpirit of a man will ſuſtain his infirmity,</hi> Prov. 18. 14. but the frowns of God and tokens of his diſpleaſure are intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: <hi>A wounded ſpirit who can bear?</hi> It made <hi>David</hi> roar, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 3. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> chatter, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38. 14. yea Chriſt himſelf to ſweat drops of congealed blood, and to cry out in the anguiſh of his ſoul, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> But after death the light of Gods countenance ſhines perpetually upon them, and ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver admit either of a cloud or Eclipſe: when <hi>Lazarus</hi> died, he who lay groveling at the rich mans gate, was found in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, in a place of warmeſt love. For ſeeing by Death Gods children are freed from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, therefore after death they have no need of Gods frowns, or corrections.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Death frees them from the very being and exiſtence of ſin. At death, <hi>the ſpirits of juſt men are made perfect, Heb,</hi> 12. 23. The death of their body
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:119443:14"/>
delivers them from the body of death. Death and ſin do not meet in a child of God; but ſo part, that when the one comes, the other is gone for ever: As when <hi>Sampſon</hi> died, the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> died with him: ſo when a child of God dies, all his ſins die with him. Hence <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, <hi>Quid eſt mors, niſi peccatorum ſepultura?</hi> what is death but the grave of our ſins wherein they are all buried? Thus death doth that at once which grace doth by degrees. Grace indeed when it is once wrought in the heart, under the conduct of the ſpirit, it reſiſts and fights againſt ſin, and gives it ſuch mortal wounds that it never fully recovers again: It dejects it from its regency, but cannot eject it from its inherency. It frees us from the raigning of ſin, but cannot free us from the remaining of ſin: After regeneration ſin hath not domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over us: But yet <hi>there is a law in our members war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt the law of our minds,</hi> and many times <hi>leading us captive unto the law of ſin that is in our members,</hi> ſo that we cannot do <hi>the good that we would; but the evil that we hate, that do we, Rom.</hi> 7. 19. 23. But when death comes, it wholly extirpates ſin, root and branch; and not one, or ſome few ſins, but all ſin; and that not for a time only, but for ever: when the ſouls of Gods children are diſ-lodged from their bodies, this troubleſome and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching inmate ſhall be diſ-lodged and thruſt out of doors for ever. Hence one ſaith, <hi>Peccatum peperit mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, &amp; filia devoravit matrem.</hi> Sin at firſt begat and brought forth death, and death at laſt deſtroys ſin, as the worm kills the tree that bred it. And as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, Death which before was <hi>porta inferni,</hi> the trap-door of Hell, is now <hi>introitus Regni,</hi> the porch that lets us into heaven. And Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> ſaith, what was before the Devils Sergeant to drag us to hell, is now the Lords Gentleman-Uſher to conduct us to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:119443:14"/>
Thus I have ſhewed you in theſe ſeven particulars what are the evils that Gods children are freed from by death: Now in the next place I will endeavour to ſhew you the priviledges that at death they are inveſted in, and the good things that they are put into the preſent poſſeſſion of: But yet this muſt be premiſed, that if I had the tongue and pen of men and Angels, yet ſhould I come far ſhort of that which I aim at: For whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can be ſaid of heaven, is not one half (as the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> ſaid of <hi>Solomons</hi> magnificence) of what we ſhall finde in that City of Pearl. To expreſſe it (ſaith a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Divine) is as impoſſible as to compaſſe heaven with a ſpan, or to contain the Ocean in a nutſhel. And <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſpeaking of the happineſſe of the Saints in heaven, ſaith, <hi>Sermo non valet exprimere, experimento opus eſt:</hi> words cannot expreſſe it; we muſt have trial of it before we can know it. But yet that which I ſhall ſay of it is contained in theſe ſix particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Death inveſts Gods children with perfection of all graces. Here we <hi>know but in part, we propheſie but in part: But when that which is perfect, is come, then that which is in part ſhall be done away,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9, 10. It's true, when God firſt regenerates and ſanctifies us, we have perfection of parts, there is no grace wanting that is neceſſary to life and ſalvation: For God doth none of his works by the halves: But yet we attain not to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of degrees till death comes: whilſt we live here we are exhorted to adde grace to grace, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1 5, 6, 7. and one degree of grace to another. We are commanded to <hi>grow in grace, and in the knowledge of eur Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 18. To make a daily progreſs, till we come unto <hi>the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſſe of Chriſt, Epheſ.</hi> 4. 13. But yet when we have done all that we can, our faith is mixed with doubtings, our love
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:119443:15"/>
to God with love of the world: our tears in repentance need waſhing in the blood of Chriſt; our humility is mixed with pride; our patience with murmurings, and all our other graces have defects in them: But in death they are all perfected, and thereby we are put into a far better condition than we were capable of in this life.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Death puts the Saints into the preſent poſſeſſion of Heaven, a ſtately place, into which there never did, or can enter any <hi>unclean thing:</hi> No dirty dog ever trampled upon this golden pavement. It's called <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 2<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</note> 
                     <hi>Paradiſe, Luke</hi> 23. 43. Indeed <hi>Paradiſe</hi> which God made for <hi>Adams</hi> palace (though the ſtatelieſt place that ever the eye of mortal man beheld, wherein was a confluence of all earthly felicities) was but a type and ſhadow of it. Heaven is a large place. <hi>In my fathers houſe</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>there are many manſions,</hi> Joh. 14. 2. Its a golden City, <hi>having the glory of God in it, and her light like to a ſtone moſt precious, even like a Jaſper ſtone, clear as Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal: and the wall of it is of Jaſper: and the City is pure gold, clear as glaſſe, the foundations of the wall are garniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all manner of precious ſtones, and the City hath no need of the Sun, neither of the Moon to ſhine in it; for the glory of God doth lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof,</hi> Rev. 21. 11, 19, 23. It's a City <hi>whoſe builder and maker is God,</hi> Heb. 1. 10. and therefore having ſuch an Architect, it muſt needs infinitely tranſcend the ſtateli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Fabricks that were ever made by man. It hath been neer theſe ſix thouſand years in preparing, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25. 34. and Chriſt, ever ſince his aſcenſion, hath been further preparing of it for us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 2. <hi>I go</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to prepare a place for you.</hi> Let us ſay therefore, as <hi>Fulgentius</hi> did, when he ſaw the <hi>Roman</hi> Nobility mounted in their pride and bravery. <hi>Si talis ſit Roma terreſtris, qualis eſt</hi>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:119443:15"/>
                     <hi>Roma coeleſtis?</hi> If <hi>Rome</hi> be ſuch a glorious and glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place, what is Heaven? How ſhould theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations make us to grow weary of the world, and groan and breath after heaven, where are riches without ruſt, pleaſure without pain, joy without ſorrow, youth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out decay, <hi>Ubi totum ſit quod velis, &amp; nihil ſit quod nolis:</hi> where is all that the heart of man can wiſh, and his mind deſire; where is nothing more that can be deſired, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than can be deſired. If an Heathen could ſay, <hi>Fugiendum eſt ad clariſsimam patriam; ibi pater, ibi omnia:</hi> How much more ſhould a Chriſtian ſay, Let us flee apace to our own Countrey that is above, ſith there is our Father; yea, there is all that heart can wiſh, or need require.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, a third priviledge wherewith all the Saints departed are inveſted, is, that they have immediate fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the bleſſed Angels, and the <hi>ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, Heb.</hi> 12. 22, 23. In heaven they enjoy <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and all the Patriarchs, and all the Prophets, and Apoſtles, and the noble army of Martyrs, their godly friends and relations which went before them, and all other the true members of Jeſus Chriſt, of what Tongue, or Nation, or Kindred ſoever they have been. One of the greateſt happineſſes which the godly enjoy in this world, is the Communion of Saints. The Prophet <hi>David</hi> profeſſeth that all his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light <hi>was in the Saints, and in thoſe that were moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,</hi> Pſal. 16. 3 and though he was a King, yet made he himſelf a companion <hi>of all them that feared God, and of them that kept his Precepts,</hi> Pſal. 119. 63. He would have ſuch, and none but ſuch, by his good will, about him. <hi>Mine eyes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: He that walketh in a perfect way, he ſhall ſerve me,</hi> Pſal. 101. 6. And yet, by woful
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:119443:16"/>
experience we ſee how many bones of contention the Devil caſts in amongſt them to ſowr their ſociety, and what breaches many times are occaſioned by ſmall and trifling matters: But in heaven they are all of one mind, which makes their ſociety the more comfortable. When <hi>Grinaeus</hi> lay on his death bed, he told ſome friends that came to viſit him, that he was going to that place, <hi>Ubi Luthero cum Zuinglio optime convenit:</hi> where <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius</hi> (who becauſe they differed in judgment about the manner of Chriſts preſence in the Sacrament, could never agree on earth) agreed excellent well. In heaven (if there be degreesof glory, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably there are) yet ſhall not thoſe who have their choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt graces crowned with the greateſt weight of glory, deſpiſe or over-look the meaneſt Saint, but they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly knit together in the bonds of deareſt love.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Another priviledge which our Chriſtian friends departed enjoy in heaven, is, that they are neerli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er united to their Head Chriſt than poſſibly they could be in this world. It's true, that even whilſt they live here, they are the members of Chriſt. For the holy Apoſtle tells us, <hi>that as we have many members in one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy—ſo we being many are one body in Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 12. 4. 5. yet are we now at a great diſtance from him. Our head is in heaven, and we upon the earth, and therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that <hi>whilſt we are at home in the body, we are abſent from the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6. and this makes us ſigh and groan, <hi>not for that we would be uncloathed, but cloathed upon, that mortality might be ſwallowed up of life,</hi> verſ. 4. And this made the Church to pray ſo pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 14. <hi>Make haſt, my beloved, and be thou like to a Roe, or to a young Hart upon the mountains of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf conſidering his diſtance from his Head, cties out:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:119443:16"/>
                     <hi>Dis cupio ſolvi, tecumque O Chriſte, manere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 23. <hi>I deſire to depart, and to be with Chriſt, which is</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; by much far the better. And no marvel, though the members do ſo long to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned with their Head in heaven. For there (as one ſaith excellently) the Lord Jeſus Chriſt perpetually and without intermiſſion manifeſteth the moſt glorious and viſible ſignes of his preſence, and ſeals of his love: He there pours forth all the plenteous demonſtrations of his goodneſſe to his members, and gives them eyes to ſee it, and minds to conceive it, and ſo fills them with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding fulneſſe of love to him again; ſo that they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſwim in pleaſure, and are overwhelmed with joy. A joy too big to enter into them; and therefore they are ſaid to enter into it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 21. A glory fitter to be believed, than poſſibly to be diſcourſed: An exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, exceſſive, eternal weight of glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. Such a weight, that if the body were not upheld by the mighty power of God, it were impoſſible but that it ſhould faint under it.

Is it not better to loſe ſin and ſorrow than to retain them? and upon this account it is, that the wiſeſt of men, <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 1.—that the day of death is better than the day of ones birth. The <hi>Greeks</hi> call the beginning of mans nativity, the beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his miſery. Man that is born of a woman, is born to trouble, <hi>Job</hi> 14. 1. If he lives to ſee the light, he comes crying into the world: A <hi>fletu vitam auſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi>

ſaith <hi>Seneca;</hi> and Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaking hereof, ſaith, <hi>Nondum loquitur, &amp; tamen prophetat:</hi> Ere ever a child ſpeaks, he propheſies by his tears, of his inſuing ſorrows: <hi>Nec prius natus, quam damnatus;</hi> No ſooner is he born, but he is condemned to the Gallies, as it were of ſin and ſuffering: and therefore in this Text <hi>Solomon</hi> prefers his Coffin before his Cradle; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon one infers, One would wonder (ſaith he) that our life here being ſo grievouſly afflicted, ſhould yet be ſo inordinately affected; and yet ſo it is, that God is even forced to ſmoke us out of our clayie cottages, and to make our life to be unto us no better then a lingring death, that we may grow weary of it, and breath after a better.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe they are not only not loſers, but they are great gainers by death: they are immediately put into a far better condition than they were capable of in this life. The day of death is to them the day-break of eternal righteouſneſſe. It gives them <hi>malorum ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptionem, bonorum adeptionem,</hi> freedome from all evil, and the fruition of all good. And as it's not a loſſe but a preferment and honour for a married woman to forſake her own kindred and fathers houſe to go to her husband; ſo it's not a loſſe, but a preferment for the ſouls of our friends for a time to relinquiſh their bodies, that they may go to Chriſt, who hath married them to himſelf for ever. Hence our Saviour Chriſt comforts the dying thief upon the Croſs with this: <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe,</hi> Luke 23. 43. why then ſhould we ſo mourn for them, ſeeing our loſs is their gain? they are indeed abſent from us, but it is that they <hi>may be preſent with the Lord:</hi> they have put off the old rags of morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that they may be cloathed with immortality: they have parted with fleſh and blood, that ſo they may be

Firſt, we muſt not take upon us to be wiſer than God, or to teach him, as when to give us children, ſo how long <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> to continue them unto us. It's his Royal Prerogative, that <hi>He may do with his own what he pleaſeth.</hi> They are not ſo much our children as Gods, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 21. He doth but put them forth to us to nurſe, and may ſend for them home when he pleaſeth. We who are parents would not take it well if having ſet forth a child to nurſe, when we ſend for it home, the nurſe ſhould refuſe to part with it, and grow into impatiency when we take it away. Neither can God take it well at our hands.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Was your child young when he died? Yet remember that it was Gods mercy to ſpare him ſo long. For life is not long enough to deſerve the title of time, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>There is a time to be born, and a time to die:</hi> He doth not ſay, There is a time to be born, and a time to live.

                  <p>God deals with ſome, as a skilful Limner doth with his Maſter-piece, brings it, and ſets it forth to be gazed at and admired by the multitude; and after a while draws a curtain over it, and carrieth it back into his houſe again: ſo God ſends ſome whom he endows with admirable parts to be looked upon, and wondred at by the world, and then draws the ſable curtain of Death over them, and takes them into his own habitation in heaven. Indeed the longeſt liver hath but a ſhort cut from the grave of the womb, to the womb of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:119443:19"/>
grave. <hi>Orimur, morimur,</hi> we are born, we die. And conſidering the frailty of our lives, it's no marvel that we die ſo ſoon; it's rather a marvel that we eſcaped ſo long. For <hi>Mors ubique nos expectat:</hi> Death waits for us at every turn: In the fields, in the ſtreets, in our houſes, in our beds, &amp;c. <hi>Mille modis morimur;</hi> we come but one way into the world, but we may go out a thoufand wayes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Did your child die young? yet if he was ripe for heaven, he lived till he was old enough. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> ſaith of a godly young man, that <hi>in brevi vitae ſpatio tempora virtutum multa replevit,</hi> He lived long in a little time. And indeed ſome live more in a moneth or two, then others do in many years. A good man (ſaith reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Doctor <hi>Preſton)</hi> prolongs his dayes, though he dies young, becauſe he is ripe before he is taken from the tree: He even falls into the hands of God that gathers him. They that die ſoon in Gods fear and favour, though as grapes they be gathered before they be ripe; and as lambs ſlain before they be grown up, yet (beſides the happineſſe of heaven) they have this advantage, that they be freed from the violence of the wine-preſs that others fall into, and eſcape many rough ſtorms that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers meet with.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Did God take away your dear relation whilſt he was young? What then? Hath God any where promiſed that all ſhall live till they be old? Is not mortality the ſtage of mutability? Doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſhew us, that man is but the dream of a dream: but an empty vanity, but the curious picture of nothing, but a poor feeble dying flaſh? In <hi>Golgotha</hi> there are skulls of all ſizes. <hi>Bernard</hi> tells us, <hi>Senibus mors in ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuis, adoleſcentibus in inſidiis:</hi> Death ſtands at old mens
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:119443:20"/>
doors, and it lies in wait to ſurprize young men alſo. It's like lightning, that blaſts the green corn as well as the dry: like the thunder-bolt that daſheth in pieces new and ſtrong buildings as well as old. Do you not know that, as for our lands, ſo for our lives, we are but Gods tenants at will? Mans life is his day: and we ſee by experience that dayes are not all of a length; but ſome longer, ſome ſhorter. Death is the Lady and Empreſs of all the World; and from her ſentence the youngeſt cannot appeal. As the Rivers haſte to the Sea, and the Stars to the Weſt, ſo man haſtens to the grave. It's <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Conventionis,</hi> the Houſe of Parliament, where all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates and ages meet together.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is that we are exhorted to gather <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> in the morning of our lives: <hi>To remember our Creator in the dayes of our youth, Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 1. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent our firſt-fruits to God, whoſe <hi>ſoul deſires the firſt ripe fruits,</hi> Micah 7. 1. and who will <hi>remember the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse of our youth, the love of our eſponſals,</hi> Jer. 2. 2.

                  <p>Muſt we keep a mean in our mourning for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed friends? This then may exhort and perſwade <note place="margin">

more frequently we are impatient, either outwardly fretting at the rod, like thoſe plunging horſes which will not indure their Rider; or inwardly repining, like thoſe horſes which digeſt their choler, by biting their bridles. And if we neither deſpiſe, nor impatiently murmur againſt the diſpenſation of God, yet our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is ſuch, that we are ready to take the affliction too much to heart, ſo that our ſpirits droop and faint: and this is ſo much the worſe, becauſe it's commonly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a wilful indiſpoſition, which will not ſuffer us to entertain ſuch things whereby we might be truly comforted: and the hearts of ſuch many times, like <hi>Nabals,</hi> die within them, that they are not capable of counſel; ſo that all conſolatory exhortations are to them like water ſpilt upon the ground: whereas we ſhould take our correction, and humble our ſelves under the ſmart of it: but withall we ſhould look to Chriſt, and beg of him that he would not ſuffer our Faith, Hope and Meekneſſe of mind to be overturned.</p>
                  <p>Again, conſider that it's not love to them, when we are perſwaded, that they are with the Lord, which makes us exceſſively grieve when they are taken from us: It is indeed ſelf-love and carnal affection. Our Lord Chriſt told his Diſciples, <hi>If ye loved me, you would be glad becauſe I go to the Father.</hi> And what meaſure <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh</hi> 14. 28.</note> then do we offer to God herein? We can many times ſend our children far from us, where it may be we ſhall <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Baines.</hi>

How much better were it for us to do as <hi>David</hi> did (that man after Gods own heart) who when he heard that his child was dead, <hi>aroſe from the earth, and waſhed, and anointed himſelf, and changed his apparel, and went into the houſe of the Lord, and worſhipped, and then came into his own houſe, and called for bread, and did eat,</hi> 2 Sam. 12. 20.</p>
                  <p>Again, the conſideration hereof may miniſter ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar conſolation. <note place="margin">
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, To every godly perſon, when he lies upon his ſick bed, and ſees death approaching, and his friends ſtanding about his bed weeping and wringing their hands, and that upon a twofold ground.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe himſelf hath hope in his death, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 32. Death is to him as the valley of <hi>Achor:</hi> It's a door of hope to give entrance into Paradiſe, and to tranſlate him into a ſtate of bleſſedneſſe, whereas to the wicked it's a trap-door, through which they fall into hell. It's an excellent ſaying, <hi>Improbi dum ſpirant, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: Juſtus etiam cum expirat, ſperat:</hi> wicked men hope whilſt they live; but a godly man, when he breaths forth his laſt, hath hope. He is like unto that dying Swan, of which <hi>Aelian</hi> tells us that ſang moſt ſweetly and melodiouſly at her death, though in her life-time ſhe had no ſuch pleaſant note. There is ſome truth in that ſaying of the Heathen, <hi>Optimum eſt non naſci, prox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imum quam celerrime mori.</hi> For wicked men, it had been beſt for them never to have been born, or being born to die quickly, ſeeing that by living long they heap up ſin, and thereby treaſure up <hi>wrath againſt the day of wrath:</hi> but as for good men, the day of death is beſt to them, becauſe here to live is but to lie a dying;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:119443:22"/>
and eternal life which they are now taking poſſeſſion of, is the onely true life, as ſaith Saint <hi>Auſtine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe as they have hope themſelves in their death, ſo they leave a good hope to their friends, to quiet their hearts in their loſſe. Oh what a cutting grief is it to a godly heart, to ſee a child, or kinſman, or other dear relation taken away, and cut off in the midſt of his ſins, ſo that he can have no hope of his bleſſed eſtate in another life! But on the contrary, (if ſelf-love be not too prevalent with us) we cannot but moum moderately for thoſe which die in the Lord, and ſay with holy <hi>Job, The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken away, Bleſsed be the Name of the Lord.</hi> How much better cauſe have ſuch than <hi>Tully</hi> to cry out, <hi>O praeclarum diem, cum ad illud animorum concilium, coetum<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>
                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan> proficiſcar, &amp; cum ex hac turba, &amp; colluvione diſcedam!</hi> O what a brave and bright day is it to our friends when they go to the Congregation-houſe of bleſſed ſpirits, and walk no longer in the way of this world, which is (like the land of <hi>Chabul)</hi> dirty and dangerous: Like the the vale of <hi>Siddim,</hi> ſlimy and ſlippery, full of lime-pits and pit-falls, ſnares and ſtumbling-blocks laid by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to maim and miſchief them.</p>
                  <p>Here is comfort alſo to the Parents and Relations of this young Gentleman now with the Lord, in that they have and may have a well-grounded hope of his now bleſſed eſtate in heaven: could he ſpeak to you, you ſhould hear him ſaying, <hi>Weep not for me, but weep for your ſelves, for I have made a bleſsed change, and am gone from night to day, from darkneſs to light, from ſorrow to ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and from a troubleſome world to a Heaven of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> And this brings me to the laſt thing which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, which is to ſpeak ſomething of our deceaſed brother. But before I begin, I thought fit to make
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:119443:23"/>
this profeſſion: That I ſhall ſpeak nothing of him, but what I either obſerved in him my ſelf, or have from the faithful relations of thoſe which were neerer about him, the truth of whoſe teſtimony I dare not call into queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And what I ſhall ſpeak of him, I ſhall reduce to theſe two heads:</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>Firſt, to ſhew you what were his priviledges.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, what improvement he made of them.</item>
                     <item>His priviledges were theſe:</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Firſt, that he was born of godly parents, <hi>Et naſci ex piis parentibus non minima laus eſt:</hi> To be born of godly parents, as it's no ſmall praiſe, ſo it's no ſmall priviledg. <hi>The glory of children are their parents,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 14. 6. It was a great honour to <hi>Jacob,</hi> that he could ſwear <hi>by the fear of his Father</hi> Iſaac: To <hi>David,</hi> that he could ſay, <hi>I am thy ſervant, and the ſon of thy handmaid,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 53.</note> Pſal. 116. 16. To <hi>Timothy, that the ſame faith that was in him dwelt firſt in his mother and Grand-mother,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 5. To thoſe children whoſe mother Saint <hi>John</hi> ſtiles the <hi>elect Lady:</hi> To <hi>Mark, that he was Barnabas</hi>'s <hi>ſiſters ſon:</hi> To <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Rufus,</hi> that they <hi>were children to Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of Cyrene, Mar.</hi> 15. 21. Now the priviledge of ſuch children conſiſts in theſe two things:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that they have the godly example of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, as a copy or continual pattern ſor their imitation; and experience tells us, that childrens manners are much moulded by the examples of their parents. Its report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Harts of <hi>Scythia,</hi> that they teach their young ones to leap from bank to bank, from rock to rock, and from one turfe to another, by leaping before them, by which means when they are hunted, no beaſt can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them: So godly parents, by giving a good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of piety to their children when they are young, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them from Satan (that mighty hunter) that he
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:119443:23"/>
ſhall never have them for his prey.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Children of believing parents are by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their parents copy &amp; Gods gracious entail, within the compaſs of the Covenant, as appears <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. <hi>I will eſtabliſh my Covenant between me and thee, and thy ſeed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thee in their generations for an everlaſting Covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy ſeed after thee,</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112. 2. <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking of the bleſſedneſs of that man that feareth the Lord, adds, <hi>His ſeed ſhall be mighty upon earth; the generation of the upright ſhall be bleſsed:</hi> and <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 39. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, <hi>the promiſe is made to you, and to your children:</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> to the ſame purpoſe adds, <hi>If the firſt fruit be holy, the lump is alſo holy; and if the root be holy, ſo are the branches,</hi> Rom. 11. 16.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a ſecond priviledge was, that preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his coming into the world, he was by the care of his godly parents preſented before and dedicated unto God, being made a viſible member of the Church by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, which is called a <hi>Laver of regeneration, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of the Holy Ghoſt, Tit.</hi> 3. 5. yea, Baptiſme is ſaid <hi>to ſave us,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. To wit, Sacramentally; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſeals up ſalvation to the believer, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 16. and it is of perpetual and permanent uſe to him for that purpoſe throughout his whole life, <hi>ut ſcaturigo ſemper e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulliens;</hi> as a Fountain bubling up to eternal life. And truly this his priviledge was the greater, if we conſider how many poor Infants are deprived of it, through the default of their parents in theſe laſt and worſt of times, who yet pretend much to Religion.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that with <hi>Timothy,</hi> from a child he was taught to know the Scriptures, which <hi>are able to make one wiſe to ſalvation,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 15. and his Chriſtian parents were the more careful to inſtruct him therein, becauſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had found it <hi>fit milk for babes,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2. dainty
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:119443:24"/>
and delicious food, <hi>ſweeter than hony, Pſal.</hi> 119. 103. <hi>wells of ſalvation, Iſa.</hi> 12. 3. <hi>Breaſts of conſolation, Iſa.</hi> 66. 11. the hony-drops of Chriſts mouth, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 11. To be preferred before <hi>gold and ſilver, Pſal.</hi> 19. 11. Before <hi>pearls aad rubies, Prov.</hi> 3. 15. Before all other <hi>learning, Deut.</hi> 4. 6. They knew that the Scriptures are a <hi>lamp to our feet,</hi> as ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119. 105. Gods Epiſtle to us, as ſaith <hi>Gregory:</hi> The ſouls food, as <hi>Athanaſius:</hi> The ſouls phyſick, as <hi>Chryſoſtome:</hi> The invariable rule of truth, as <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> &amp;c. their care therefore was ſo to acquaint him with them from his childhood, that he might love them as his ſiſter, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 4. that he might be ready in them, and have them alwayes, as <hi>Saul</hi> had his ſpear at his boulſter: as <hi>David</hi> had his ſtones at hand in his ſcrip. And thus (according to the Apoſtles rule, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 4.) he was brought up <hi>in the nurture and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It was his priviledge, and happineſſe to be brought forth in ſuch a time, and to be brought up in ſuch a City, wherein he enjoyed more plentiful means of grace and ſalvation than he could have done in former times, and (I dare boldly ſay) in any other City or place in the Chriſtian world beſides. We read of <hi>Plato,</hi> that when he drew neer unto his death, he rejoyced and gave God thanks for three things: Firſt, for that he had made him a reaſonable man, and not a bruit beaſt. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, a <hi>Greek,</hi> and not a <hi>Barbarian.</hi> And thirdly, that he was born in the time of <hi>Socrates,</hi> from whom be had learned many good inſtructions. How much more cauſe had this Gentleman to praiſe God for making him a man, a Chriſtian, and a <hi>Londoner</hi> at ſuch a time as this?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, his parents were not onely thus careful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to bring him up in the knowledg and fear of God,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:119443:24"/>
but to have him inſtructed in humane learning alſo, that thereby (if the Lord ſhould pleaſe to lengthen out the thrid of his life) he might be the more uſeful and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable in his Generation: For which end</p>
                  <p>Firſt, they took care to have him taught the firſt grounds of learning, and that betimes in his childhood, whereby he excelled and out went not onely many of his contemporaries, but divers that were older than himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when he was thus fitted at home, they pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him forth at a Boarding-ſchool, in the family of a godly Miniſter, that ſo, whileſt he went forward in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, he might make a further progreſſe in divine lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning alſo.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when they thought fit to take him back un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their own wing (being exceeding tender of him) and not daring to truſt him in a publick ſchool, by reaſon of thoſe many evil examples that he might meet with there, they provided a godly and learned Tutor whom they maintained in their own houſe, to have the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Pat. Drummond.</hi>
                     </note> and education of him.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were his Priviledges. Now fot his improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them.</p>
                  <p>But before I mention that, I muſt tell you with what parts God had endowed him, whereby he was enabled to make a good improvement of theſe opportunities: and therein eſpecially theſe three things were remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>Firſt, that he had a quick Invention.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, A ſtrong and active phanſie.</item>
                     <item>Thirdly, A diligent and induſtrious ſpirit.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>And by help of theſe he quickly learned to read and write, and ſo proceeded to the grounds of the <hi>Latine</hi> tongue; and after he had made a good progreſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:119443:25"/>
the care of his Tutor was to acquaint him alſo with the ſacred Languages of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew:</hi> and then he applied himſelf to the ſtudy of the Arts: firſt, of <hi>Logick,</hi> then of <hi>Philoſophy, Aſtronomy, Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy;</hi> and (being denied the opportunity of travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling abroad) he ſpent ſome time in reading <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> and the Travels of ſundry perſons both by Sea &amp; Land. And laſtly, being admitted a member of that Honourable Society of <hi>Grayes-Inne,</hi> he betook himſelf to the Study of the <hi>Law,</hi> and made no inconſiderable progreſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: by all which (if God had lengthened out his dayes) he might probably have been very ſerviceable to his Countrey. All which being conſidered, I may ſay with a reverend Divine, <hi>That it's a bleſſed inſtitution of younger years, when reaſon and Religion are together faſhioned and moulded in a tender mind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that which gave him the greateſt luſtre, and was (as it were) the Diamond in the Ring, is yet behind, which I ſhall reduce to theſe three Heads.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>Firſt, his Piety to God.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, his Dutifulneſſe to his Parents.</item>
                     <item>Thirdly, his Charity to the poor.</item>
                     <item>His Piety to God manifeſted it ſelf, both</item>
                     <item>In his Life; and</item>
                     <item>At his Death.</item>
                     <item>In his Life. by</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Firſt, his conſtant and diligent attending upon the publick Ordinances, wherein he was not an idle and careleſſe hearer, but could in the evening give a good account of what he had heard in the day.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, His careful ſanctification of the whole Sabbath, inſomuch as if (through inadvertency) any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting and unſeaſonable ſpeeches had proceeded from him on that day, his heart ſmote him for it, and it made
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:119443:25"/>
him more cautious for the future.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Beſides his joyning in Family-prayers, and with his Tutor, his manner was, to retire daily into his Cloſet, where he firſt read a portion of Scripture, and that not curſorily as too many do, but endeavouring to underſtand what he read; and when he met with any hard place, he uſed to enquire of his Tutor, therein fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the advice of a worthy Divine: The difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which we meet with in reading the Word of God (ſaith he) ſhould not weaken, but waken our more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſearch; not being contented with the firſt oar that offers itſelf to our view; but digging deeper and deeper we ſhould ſearch till we become owners of the whole treaſure, which will ſufficiently pay us for all our pains. After the Scripture read he betook himſelf to prayer: in which duties, if he was diſturbed, he was diſpleaſed with it, and what at one time he omitted, he uſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain at another; all which he carried on with ſuch pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy, that ſcarce any, beſides his Tutor, knew of it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, to theſe alſo of late he adjoyned Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is an excellent Character of a godly perſon: For, as the Philoſophers ſtone (they ſay) turns all metal into gold: as the Bee ſucks honey out of every flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: and as a good ſtomak ſucks ſome wholſom nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of the food that it receives into itſelf: So doth an holy heart, ſo far as its ſanctified, convert and digeſt all into ſpiritual and uſeful thoughts and meditations: and we ſhall find by experience, that when we go to ſleep with ſome holy meditations in our minds, it will be an excellent preſervative againſt fooliſh dreams and <gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">
                        <desc>••••</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and we ſhall finde our hearts in the better frame when we awake: As he that rakes up his fire over night, ſhall find it again in the morning, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 15, 16.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:119443:26"/>
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 22. Now of his dexterity in this kind, I ſhall anon give you an example, which he hath left in writing behind him.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, he reverenced and loved godly Miniſters and Chriſtians, and liked that Miniſtry beſt that was moſt plain, powerful, and ſearching. I remember that <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> in his me obſerved two ſorts of Divines: one was <hi>Theologus Crucis,</hi> the poor Divine, that preached plainly, and told men faithfully how things ſtood with them: The other was <hi>Theologus gloriae,</hi> the Divine that hunted after praiſe, glory, and preferment; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom his prayer was, A <hi>Theologo gloriae liberet ſuam Eccleſiam Dominus;</hi> that God would deliver his Church from vain-glorious Divines. <hi>Peter</hi> ſo preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that his hearers were <hi>pricked at the heart, Act.</hi> 2. 37, 38. and <hi>Steven</hi>'s hearers were <hi>cut at the heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> with his words, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 54. And truly this was the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable in this young Gentleman, ſeeing there be ſo many at this time, and in this City, that are like thoſe <hi>Greeks,</hi> that counted the plain preaching of the Croſs fooliſhneſſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 22. 23. ſo that neither God, nor his Miniſters can pleaſe them, except they ſpeak tink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and tickling words. But ſuch ſhould get their ears healed (as <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> adviſed his Countrey-men of <hi>Greece</hi> to do) before they can hear Gods Word with profit. They muſt learn of Bees to paſſe by Roſes and Violets, and to ſit upon Thime, though it be bitter; and to preferre ſound rebukes before ſmooth flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, he was willing to be admoniſhed, and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for what was amiſs in him, being herein of <hi>Davids</hi> mind, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141. 5. <hi>Let the righteous ſmite me, it ſhall be a kindneſſe; and let him reprove me, it ſhall be an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent oil which ſhall not break my head.</hi> He was one of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:119443:26"/>
thoſe that had an obedient ear to reproofs, of whom <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25. 12. <hi>As an ear-ring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold; ſo is a wiſe reprover to an obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ear.</hi> And this is one good ſign of a godly wiſe man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 5. <hi>He that regards reproof, is prudent,</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 31. <hi>the ear that heareth the reproof of life, abides a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the wiſe. Heſiod</hi> tells us of three ſorts of men: Firſt, ſuch as live ſo well that they need no reproof; theſe are beſt of all. Secondly, ſuch as do not ſo well, but can be content to hear of it; and theſe (ſaith he) are not bad. Thirdly, ſuch as will neither do as they ought, nor be adviſed to do better; theſe are in a very dangerous condition, ſuch may read their doom, and ſee their deſtiny, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 21, 22. <hi>Truth</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>is ſharp, but bitter though it be, yet it is better and more ſavoury to ſound ſences, then the hony-drops of a flattering tongue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventhly, He (by Gods grace) reſiſted tentations frome ſome of his familiars, who would have drawn him to Taverns, and mildly reproved them for it. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all theſe I ſhall preſent you with the atteſtation of his Tutor, given me in writing, and that in his own words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>He was (ſaith he) when I came to him (which was about four years ago) a Chriſtian youth, well princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled in the grounds of Religion, and I left him a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before he died (which was about the eighteenth year of his age) knowing what was in the Aſſemblies <hi>Confeſsion of faith,</hi> in <hi>Wollebius,</hi> and what <hi>Altingius</hi> in his <hi>Didactica</hi> hath written: Of late alſo he delighted much to read <hi>Calvins Inſtitutions,</hi> and B. <hi>Halls Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations,</hi> and of his knowledge of the things of God, yea of the hardeſt of them, I have found ſatisfaction af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter trial: He not onely knew God, but loved him, and in his laſt ſickneſſe, wept to think that he had, and did
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:119443:27"/>
love God no more. He was a lover of the children and Miniſters of God; and amongſt his acquaintance he valued them moſt, in whom he ſaw moſt of vertue. He heard the Word, and could retain and judg of what he heard, and did not ſo much affect flaunting and quaint preaching, as that which ſpake moſt home to his heart. In his Cloſet, before he came out of his chamber, he read a portion of Scripture, from which he hath raiſed pertinent obſervations, when put to the trial; and what he knew not, that he asked. He read with judgment, and hath ſaid, that all other books but the Bible did bring wearineſs: &amp; to his reading he joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed prayer: I have ſeen him diſpleaſed, when diſturbed, and what at one time he omitted, at another time he would repair; and this he carried on with ſo little noiſe, that I only was privy to it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you have heard of his piety manifeſted in his life: <hi>&amp; vita qualis, finis talis;</hi> as was his life, ſuch was his death. For,</p>
                  <p>In his laſt ſickneſſe (which was the ſmall Pox accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a Feaver) he bore it with great patience. He inquired of his Tutor, how he might know that he loved God? and being anſwered, he brake forth into tears: and when his Tutor asked him, why he wept? he anſwered, Becauſe he had loved God no more, nor made a better improvement of his former deliverances. Yet he ſaid, that the word of God was his meditation, the promiſes whereof did now comfort him. He was ſenſible of his approaching Death, and the night before, told ſome about him, that he ſhould not live another night. One of his laſt words was, <hi>I muſt be gone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next thing that I propounded to ſpeak of was, his dutifulneſſe to his parents, which can be teſtified by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: Indeed they were very tender of him, and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:119443:27"/>
towards him, yet did not he abuſe their love to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, nor through familiarity contemn their authority, but was many times content to refrain from things law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ſuitable to his deſires, to give them ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                  <p>Neirher was his charity to the poor leſſe remarkable then the two former. For from his childhood he would often go to the ſervants to fetch relief fot ſuch poor as came to his Fathers door. And being grown up to more maturity, he frequently diſtributed money amongſt them, &amp; would many times ſay, that if God ever brought him to the enjoyment of his eſtate, he would as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly make proviſion for ſuch as were in want, as for himſelf and Family. He knew that, <hi>Temporalia Dei ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis impenſa, non pereunt, ſed parturiunt,</hi> Almes given to the poor, periſh not, but multiply: that bounty is the moſt compendious way to plenty; and that hereby he might lay up <hi>a good foundation for himſelf againſt the time to come,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 18. He knew that rich mens houſes ſhould be Gods Store-houſes; and that ſowing oft of this fruitful ſeed, we ſhall be ſure to reap in our greateſt need: and <hi>God is not unrighteous to forget our labour of love</hi> in this kind, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 10. Oh! how may this ſhame many rich men that keep no proportion between their increaſes for God, and increaſes from God: that though they are rich in this world, yet they are poor in good works: they lay not by for pious and charitable uſes, as <hi>God hath bleſſed them,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 2. But indeed are, the richer the harder, as children that have their mouths full, and both hands full, and yet will part with none, but ſpill it rather. Men when they grow fat, have ſo much the leſſe blood: So the fatter men are in their eſtates, the leſſe blood, life, and ſpirits they have for God: Or if they do give ſomething, yet they do not <hi>love mercy,</hi>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:119443:28"/>
Micha 6. 8. they are not <hi>ready to diſtribute, willing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate.</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 18. their mercy doth not flow from them like water from the Fountain, or light from the Sun, naturally and freely: but it muſt be wrung from them, like verjuice from the crab, or as diſtilled water, that is forced out by the heat of the fire.</p>
                  <p>Its no marvel therefore that this charitable frame of heart contributed ſo much towards the comfortable end of this our deceaſed brother. I remember what <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith, <hi>Non memini me legiſſe malâ morte mortuum, qui li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benter opera charitatis exercuit: habet enim multos inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsores.</hi> I do not remember (ſaith he) that I ever read of any one that died an ill death that was frequent in works of charity; and no marvel, ſor he hath many interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors for him; which agrees with that of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 112. 9. <hi>He hath diſperſed, he hath given to the poor, his rightcouſneſſe indures for ever, his horn ſhall be exalted with honour, and</hi> Pſal. 41. 3. <hi>the Lord will ſtrengthen him upon the bed of languiſhing: Thou wilt make all his bed in his ſickneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having thus diſpatched thoſe three things that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſpeak to, I might adde much more, by telling you of his humility in concealing himſelf and his own parts, as the ſweet violet that grows low, neer unto the ground, and withall hides it ſelf under it's own leaves. Of his ſweet and affable nature, and loving and courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſpoſition: Of his indefatigable diligence in his imployments, and ſhunning, yea hating of idleneſſe. I ſhall only adde one word more of his ingeniouſneſſe in, and the uſefulneſſe of his recreations, which were divers: one while he exerciſed himſelf in the Art of <hi>Dialling;</hi> another while he applied himſelf to <hi>Muſick:</hi> But I ſhall ſay no more of theſe, becauſe he attained not to any perfection in them; that which he followed with moſt
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:119443:28"/>
diligence and delight was the Art of Drawing, Painting, and Limning, whereof he hath left many very good Pieces for ſo young a Practitioner; and had he lived longer, probably he would have attained to a great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection therein. He had alſo a <hi>Poëtical</hi> Vein, whereof I ſhall give you a taſte by and by.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>His meditation upon the Hiſtory of Chriſts Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration,</hi> Matth. 17. 1, &amp;c.</q>
                  <p>Jeſus Chriſt is ſo willing that we ſhould have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him in this life, that he takes us up into his moſt ſecret retirements.</p>
                  <p>Prayer is a divine aſcention, and whoſoever would pray ſpiritually, muſt have an holy elevation of ſpirit to meet God in that duty.</p>
                  <p>High Turrets of faith and mountains of graces are the real helps in prayer.</p>
                  <p>In prayer we are ſure to enjoy Gods preſence. It's a ſure way to ſee God face to face; and (if I may ſo ſay) in his natural complexion: we may meet with God, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did in the Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> of Prayer.</p>
                  <p>It was in the Mount praying when the faſhion of Chriſts countenance was altered: It is in the mountain of prayer that Chriſts purity appeareth more and more to a believer.</p>
                  <p>Never more whiteneſſe do believers ſee in Chriſt, then in their prayers to him.</p>
                  <p>In this life the Saints have a taſte of the gliſtering and whiteneſſe of his out-ſide: But in the life to come it is that they have immediate fruition of himſelf: In this life we only ſee a ſudden transfiguration to ſtay our ſtomacks (as I may ſay) till hereafter at what time we ſhall ſee him as he is: and if this transfiguration appears white <gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">
