            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

not think <hi>the Truth</hi> I defended ſo weak as to
need a new Treatiſe to bear it up. I ſee it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
with <hi>you,</hi> who dare not let your former
<hi>Books</hi> ſtand by themſelves, without another to
ſupport them. It is indeed the way of the <hi>Popiſh Schools</hi> to
fill the world with <hi>Volumes</hi> and <hi>Tomes,</hi> and rather to aſtoniſh

<hi>Reader</hi> in the Labyrinth of <hi>Replies</hi> and <hi>Rejoynders.</hi> Your

and what is <hi>yours</hi> again in anſwer to <hi>mine,</hi> and what
<hi>Truth</hi> is after all this.</p>
            <p>I finde it to be the wiſedom of the Spirit of <hi>God,</hi> to leave the

but a reference to other Divines, who have writ of the like

you, or an Argumentative Treaſurie, to which you referre us with

(4) That I ſhould reſtore ſuch Tythes, if unlawful, as I formerly
received, becauſe the ſin till then is not remitted (5) That I would have
men believe as they liſt (6) That he was wiſhed rather to a neglect of
me, then a loud Conqueſt over me. (7) That he had rather confute <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi>

               <p>To the 2. Is Presbytery, becauſe Parochial, Claſſical, Provincial,
leſſe Tyrannical then Epiſcopal, becauſe many rule in that, and in this
but one? or rather not more tyrannical, becauſe one Tyrant is not ſo

What elſe hath your Aſſembly and othersibeen doing? Is it not a
power in your Elderſhip and Presbyterie, how little or large ſoever,

               <p>To the 4. For my <hi>reſtoring of Tythes,</hi> now unlawful to me; I have
done it; I have returned to the State my property of a full yeers Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rearag:
nor did I take Tythes ſince I was in <hi>Kent,</hi> but the peoples free
compoſition from the firſt; and being even convinced againſt that
too, a yeer ſince, I forbore it. But take heed how you put forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of <hi>ſin</hi> upon <hi>reſtitution;</hi> for that is not onely <hi>Popery,</hi> but like the
<hi>Pope</hi> you would <hi>ſell pardons</hi> onely to the <hi>rich,</hi> and none to the <hi>poor;</hi>
and you would put more upon <hi>Sacrifice</hi> then upon <hi>Mercy.</hi>
