            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the most excellently accomplish'd, Mrs. <hi>K. P.</hi> upon her Poems.</head>
            <lg>
               <head>1.</head>
               <l>WE allow'd your Beauty, and we did submit</l>
               <l>To all the tyrannies of it.</l>
               <l>Ah, cruel Sex! will you depose us too in Wit?</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Orinda</hi> does in that too reign,</l>
               <l>Does Man behind her in proud triumph draw,</l>
               <l>And cancel great <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Salick Law.</l>
               <l>We our old Title plead in vain:</l>
               <l>Man may be Head, but Woman's now our Brain:</l>
               <l>Worse then Love's fire-arms heretofore:</l>
               <l>In Beauty's camp it was not known,</l>
               <l>Too many arms, besides the Conquerour, bore.</l>
               <l>'Twas the great Cannon we brought down,</l>
               <l>T assault the stubborn Town.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Orinda</hi> first did a bold sally make,</l>
               <l>Our strongest quarter take,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:61894:3"/>
And so successful prov'd, that she</l>
               <l>Turn'd upon Love himself his own Artillery.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <head>2.</head>
               <l>Women, as if the Body were the whole</l>
               <l>Did that, and not the Soul,</l>
               <l>Transmit to their posterity;</l>
               <l>If in it something they conceiv'd,</l>
               <l>Th'abortive Issue never liv'd.</l>
               <l>'Twere shame and pity, <hi>Orinda,</hi> if in thee</l>
               <l>A Sp'rit so rich, so noble, and so high,</l>
               <l>Should unmanur'd or barren lie.</l>
               <l>But thou industriously hast sow'd and till'd</l>
               <l>The fair and fruitful Field:</l>
               <l>And 'tis a strange increase that it doth yield.</l>
               <l>As when the happy Gods above</l>
               <l>Meet all together at a F east,</l>
               <l>A secret joy unspeakably does move</l>
               <l>In their great Mother <hi>Semele</hi>'s contented breast:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:61894:3"/>
With no less pleasure thou methinks shouldst see</l>
               <l>Thus thy no less immortal Progeny:</l>
               <l>And in their Birth thou no one touch do st find:</l>
               <l>Of th' ancient C urse to Woman-kind;</l>
               <l>Thou bring' st not forth with pain,</l>
               <l>It neither travel is nor labour of thy Brain.</l>
               <l>So easily they from thee come,</l>
               <l>And there is so much room</l>
               <l>I'th' unexhausted and unfathom'd womb;</l>
               <l>That, like the <hi>Holland</hi> Countess, thou might' st bear</l>
               <l>A Child for ev'ry day of all the fertile year.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <head>3.</head>
               <l>Thou dost my wonder, would' st my envy raise,</l>
               <l>If to be prais'd I lov'd more then to praise.</l>
               <l>Where-e're I see an excellence,</l>
               <l>I must admire to see thy well-knit Sense,</l>
               <l>Thy Numbers gentle, and thy Passions high;</l>
               <l>These as thy Forehead smooth, those sparkling as thy Eye.</l>

'Tis solid and 'tis manly all,</l>
               <l>Or rather 'tis Angelical:</l>
               <l>For, as in Angels, we</l>
               <l>Do in thy Verses see</l>
               <l>Both improv'd Sexes eminently meet;</l>
               <l>They are then Man more strong, and more then Woman sweet.</l>

               <l>I ne're could find that Fancy true,</l>
               <l>But have invok'd them oft I'me sure in vain.</l>
               <l>They talk of <hi>Sappho,</hi> but, alas! the shame</l>
               <l>I'th' manners soil the lustre of her fame.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Orinda</hi>'s inward Vertue is so bright,</l>
               <l>That, like a Lantern's fair enclosed light,</l>
               <l>It through the Paper shines where she doth write.</l>
               <l>Honour and Friendship, and the gen'rous scorn</l>

To give the Law of Honour, and dispence</l>
                  <l>All that is handsom, great and worthy thence;</l>
                  <l>Are things at once your practice and your end,</l>

                  <l>But since t' oblige the World is your delight,</l>

                  <l>It would be hard t' obtain your pardon here.</l>

                  <l>Forgiveness is the noblest Charity,</l>
                  <l>And nothing can worthy your favour be.</l>
                  <l>For you (God-like) are so much your own fate,</l>

                  <l>Lie prisoners to the weather's cruelty.</l>
                  <l>We had nor Wind nor Tide, nor ought but Grief,</l>
                  <l>Till a kind Spring tide was our first relief.</l>
                  <l>Then we float merrily, forgetting quite</l>
                  <l>The sad confinement of the stormy night.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:61894:30"/>
E're we had lost these thoughts, we ran aground,</l>
                  <l>And then how vain to be secure, we found.</l>
                  <l>Now they were all surpriz'd. Well, if we must,</l>
                  <l>Yet none shall say that dust is gone to dust.</l>
                  <l>But we are off now, and the civil Tide</l>
                  <l>Assisted us the Tempests to out-ride.</l>
                  <l>But what most pleas'd my mind upon the way,</l>
                  <l>Was the Ship's posture when 't in Harbour lay:</l>
                  <l>Which so close to a rocky Grove was fixed,</l>
                  <l>That the Trees branches with the Tackling mixed.</l>
                  <l>One would have thought it was, as then it stood,</l>
                  <l>A growing Navy, or a floating Wood.</l>
                  <l>But I have done at last, and do confess</l>
                  <l>My Voyage taught me so much tediousness.</l>
                  <l>In short, the Heav'ns must needs propitious be</l>
                  <l>Because <hi>Lucasia</hi> was concern'd in me.</l>

                  <l>By wonders and by prodigy</l>

                  <l>But our Election is as free</l>
                  <l>As Angels, who with greedy choice</l>

                  <l>Our hearts are doubled by the loss,</l>

                  <l>We both diffuse, and both ingross:</l>

                  <l>We are our selves but by rebound,</l>

                  <l>Our Hearts are mutual Victims laid,</l>

                  <l>HAd I ador'd the multitude, and thence</l>
                  <l>Got an antipathy to Wit and Sense,</l>
                  <l>And hugg'd that fate in hope the World would grant</l>
                  <l>'Twas good affection to be ignorant;</l>
                  <l>Yet the least Ray of thy bright fancy seen,</l>
                  <l>I had converted, or excuseless been;</l>
                  <l>For each Birth of thy Muse to after-times</l>
                  <l>Shall expiate for all this Age's crimes.</l>
                  <l>First shines thy Amoret, twice crown'd by thee,</l>
                  <l>Once by thy Love, next by thy Poetry:</l>
                  <l>Where thou the best of Unions dost dispence,</l>
                  <l>Truth cloth'd in Wit, and Love in Innocence.</l>
                  <l>So that the muddiest Lovers may learn here,</l>
                  <l>No Fountains can be sweet that are not clear.</l>

There <hi>Juvenal</hi> reviv'd by thee declares</l>
                  <l>How flat man's Joys are, and how mean his Cares;</l>
                  <l>And generally upbraids the World that they</l>
                  <l>Should such a value for their Ruine pay.</l>
                  <l>But when thy sacred Muse diverts her Quill,</l>
                  <l>The Landskip to design of <hi>Leon</hi>'s hill;</l>
                  <l>As nothing else was worthy her or thee,</l>

                  <l>Thou fill'd with Joys too great to see or count,</l>
                  <l>Descend'st from thence like <hi>Moses</hi> from the Mount,</l>
                  <l>And with a candid, yet unquestion daw,</l>
                  <l>Restor'st the Golden Age when Verse was Law,</l>
                  <l>Instructing us, thou who secur'st thy fame,</l>
                  <l>That nothing can disturb it but my name;</l>
                  <l>Nay I have hopes that standing so near thine</l>
                  <l>'Twill lose its dress, and by degrees refine.</l>

                  <l>Through which it will not dart forth light and heat.</l>
                  <l>Thus we discover thee by thy own Day</l>
                  <l>Against thy will snatching the Cloud away.</l>
                  <l>Now the Piece shines, and though we will not say,</l>
                  <l>Parents can Souls, as Tapers lights, convey;</l>
                  <l>Yet we must grant thy Soul transmitted here</l>

And that's our highest praise, for that thy Mind</l>
                  <l>Thy Works could never a resemblance find.</l>
                  <l>That mind whose search can Nature's secret hand</l>

                  <l>Of Novelties, more fit for shew then use;</l>
                  <l>But think'st it noble Charity t' uphold</l>
                  <l>The credit and the Beauty of the old:</l>
                  <l>And with one hand canst easily support</l>
                  <l>Learning and Law, a Temple and a Court.</l>

And this secures me: for as we below</l>
                  <l>Valleys from Hills, Houses from Churches know,</l>
                  <l>But to their fight who stand extremely high,</l>
                  <l>These forms will have one flat Equality:</l>
                  <l>So from a lower Soul I might well fear</l>
                  <l>A critick censure when survey'd too near;</l>
                  <l>But from <hi>Cratander</hi> (who above the best</l>
                  <l>Lives in a height which levells all the rest)</l>
                  <l>I may that Royalty of Soul expect,</l>

Is this design'd; but pity does engage</l>
                  <l>My Pen to rescue the declining Age.</l>
                  <l>For since 'tis grown in fashion to be bad,</l>
                  <l>And to be vain or angry, proud or mad,</l>
                  <l>(While in their Vices onely Men agree)</l>
                  <l>Is thought the onely modern Gallantry;</l>
                  <l>How would some brave Examples check the crimes;</l>
                  <l>And both reproch, and yet reform, the Times?</l>
                  <l>Nor can Mortality it self reclaim</l>
                  <l>Th' apostate World like my <hi>Lucasia</hi>'s name:</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Lucasia,</hi> whose rich Soul had it been known</l>
                  <l>In that Time th' Ancierits call'd the <hi>Golden</hi> one,</l>
                  <l>When Innocence and Greatness were the same,</l>
                  <l>And Men no battels knew but in a game,</l>
                  <l>Chusing what Nature, not what Art, prefers,</l>
                  <l>Poets were Judges, Kings Philosophers;</l>
                  <l>Even then from her the Wise would copies draw,</l>
                  <l>And she to th infant World had giv'n a Law.</l>

That Souls were made of Number could not be</l>
                  <l>An Observation, but a Prophecy.</l>
                  <l>It meant <hi>Lucasia,</hi> whose harmonious state</l>
                  <l>The Spheres and Muses faintly imitate.</l>
                  <l>But as then Musick is best understood,</l>
                  <l>When every Chord's examin'd and found good:</l>
                  <l>So what in others Judgment is and Will,</l>
                  <l>In her is the same even Reason still.</l>
                  <l>And as some Colour various seems, but yet</l>
                  <l>'Tis but our difference in considering it:</l>
                  <l>So she now light, and then does light dispence,</l>
                  <l>But is one shining Orb of Excellence:</l>
                  <l>And that so piercing when she Judgment takes,</l>
                  <l>She doth not search, but Intuition makes:</l>
                  <l>And her Discoveries more easie are</l>
                  <l>Then <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Conquest in his <hi>Pontick</hi> War.</l>
                  <l>As bright and vigorous her beams are pure,</l>
                  <l>And in their own rich candour so secure,</l>

That had she liv'd where Legends were devised,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Rome</hi> had been just, and she been canonized.</l>
                  <l>Nay Innocence her self less clear must be,</l>
                  <l>If Innocence be any thing but she.</l>
                  <l>For Vertue 's so congenial to her mind,</l>
                  <l>That Liquid things, or Friends, are less combin'd.</l>
                  <l>So that in her that Sage his wish had seen,</l>
                  <l>And Vertue 's self had personated been.</l>
                  <l>Now as distilled Simples do agree,</l>
                  <l>And in th' Alembick lose variety;</l>
                  <l>So Vertue, though in pieces scatter'd 'twas,</l>
                  <l>Is by her Mind made one rich useful mass.</l>
                  <l>Nor doth Discretion put Religion down,</l>
                  <l>Nor hasty Zele usurp the Judgment's crown.</l>
                  <l>Wisdom and Friendship have one single Throne,</l>
                  <l>And make another Friendship of their own.</l>
                  <l>Each sev'ral piece darts such fierce pleasing rayes,</l>
                  <l>Poetick Lovers would but wrong in praise.</l>

                  <l>And her Humility alone excess.</l>
                  <l>Her Modesty doth wrong a Worth so great,</l>

                  <l>So to acknowledge such vast Eminence,</l>

                  <l>No, thou art gone, and thy presaging Mind</l>
                  <l>So thriftily thy early hours design'd,</l>
                  <l>That hasty Death was baffled in his Pride,</l>
                  <l>Since nothing of thee but thy Body dy'd.</l>
                  <l>Thy Soul was up betimes, and so concern'd</l>
                  <l>To grasp all Excellence that could be learn'd,</l>
                  <l>That finding nothing fill her thirsting here,</l>
                  <l>To the Spring-head she went to quench it there;</l>
                  <l>And so prepar'd, that being freed from sin</l>
                  <l>She quickly might become a Cherubin.</l>
                  <l>Thou wert all Soul, and through thy Eyes it shin'd:</l>
                  <l>Asham'd and angry to be so confin'd,</l>
                  <l>It long'd to be uncag'd, and thither flown</l>

In these vast hopes we might thy change have found,</l>
                  <l>But that Heav'n blinds whom it decrees to wound.</l>
                  <l>For Parts so soon at so sublime a pitch,</l>

                  <l>But as a Vision to be hid again.</l>
                  <l>So glorious Scenes in Masques Spectators view</l>
                  <l>With the short pleasure of an hour or two;</l>
                  <l>But that once past, the Ornaments are gone,</l>
                  <l>The Lights extinguish'd, and the Curtains drawn</l>
                  <l>Yet all these Gifts were thy less noble part,</l>
                  <l>Nor was thy Head so worthy as thy Heart;</l>
                  <l>Where the Divine Impression shin'd so clear,</l>
                  <l>As snatch'd thee hence, and yet endear'd thee here:</l>
                  <l>For what in thee did most command our love</l>

The humble greatness of thy Pious thought,</l>
                  <l>Sweetness unforc'd, and Bashfulness untaught,</l>

                  <l>I Cannot hold, for though to write were rude,</l>
                  <l>Yet to be silent were Ingratitude,</l>
                  <l>And Folly too; for if Posterity</l>
                  <l>Should never hear of such a one as thee,</l>
                  <l>And onely know this Age's brutish fame,</l>
                  <l>They would think Vertue nothing but a Name.</l>
                  <l>And though far abler Pens must her define,</l>
                  <l>Yet her Adoption hath engaged mine:</l>

                  <l>'Tis hard to write, but harder to forbear.</l>
                  <l>Sprung from an ancient and an honour'd Stem,</l>
                  <l>Who lent her lustre, and she paid it them;</l>

So still in great and noble things appeared,</l>
                  <l>Who yet their Country lov'd, and yet they feared.</l>
                  <l>Match'd to another as good and great as they,</l>

                  <l>Behold herself, who had without dispute</l>
                  <l>More then both Families could contribute.</l>
                  <l>What early Beauty Grief and Age had broke,</l>
                  <l>Her lovely Reliques and her Offspring spoke.</l>
                  <l>She was by nature and her Parents care</l>
                  <l>A Woman long before most others are.</l>
                  <l>But yet that antedated season she</l>
                  <l>Improv'd to Vertue, not to Liberty.</l>
                  <l>For she was still in either state of life</l>
                  <l>Meek as a Virgin, Prudent as a Wife.</l>
                  <l>And she well knew, although so young and fair,</l>
                  <l>Justly to mix Obedience and Care;</l>
                  <l>Whil'st to her Children she did still appear</l>

That they from her Rule and Example brought</l>
                  <l>A native Honour, which she stampt and taught.</l>
                  <l>Nor can a single Pen enough commend</l>
                  <l>So kind a Sister and so dear a Friend.</l>
                  <l>A Wisdom from above did her secure,</l>

                  <l>Her noble Beauty was her prudent Care,</l>

                  <l>She built her house, but this preserv'd hers too.</l>
                  <l>She was so pious when that she did die,</l>
                  <l>She scarce chang'd Place, I'm sure not Company.</l>
                  <l>Her Zele was printitive and practick too;</l>
                  <l>She did believe, and pray, and reade, and doe.</l>

So firm and equal Soul she had engrost,</l>
                  <l>Just ev'n to those that disoblig'd her most,</l>
                  <l>She lost all sense of wrong, glad to believe</l>
                  <l>That it was in her power to Forgive.</l>
                  <l>Her Alms I may admire, but not relate,</l>

                     <hi>But her own</hi> works shall praise her in the gate.</l>
                  <l>Her Life was checquer'd with afflictive years,</l>

                  <l>Scarce for a Husband's loss her eyes were dried,</l>
                  <l>And that loss by her Children half supplied,</l>

                  <l>But tore most off by sickness or by sword.</l>
                  <l>She, who in them could still their Father boast,</l>
                  <l>Was a fresh Widow every Son she lost.</l>
                  <l>Litigious hands did her of Light deprive,</l>
                  <l>That after all 'twas Penance to survive.</l>
                  <l>She still these Griefs had nobly undergone,</l>

Such a submissive Greatness who can find?</l>
                  <l>A tender Heart with so resolv'd a Mind?</l>
                  <l>But she, though sensible, was still the same,</l>
                  <l>Of a refined Soul, untainted Fame,</l>
                  <l>Nor were her Vertues coursly set, for she</l>
                  <l>Out-did Example in Civility.</l>
                  <l>To bestow blessings, to oblige, relieve,</l>
                  <l>Was all for which she could endure to live.</l>
                  <l>She had a joy higher in doing good,</l>
                  <l>Then they to whom the benefit accru'd.</l>
                  <l>Though none of Honour had a quicker sense,</l>
                  <l>Never had Woman more of Complaisance;</l>
                  <l>Yet lost it not in empty forms, but still</l>
                  <l>Her Nature noble was, her Soul gentile.</l>
                  <l>And as in Youth she did attract (for she</l>
                  <l>The Verdure had without the Vanity)</l>
                  <l>So she in Age was milde and grave to all,</l>
                  <l>Was not morose, but was majestical.</l>

Thus from all other Women she had skill</l>
                  <l>To draw their good, but nothing of their ill.</l>
                  <l>And since she knew the mad tumultuous World,</l>
                  <l>Saw Crowns revers'd, Temples to ruine hurl'd;</l>
                  <l>She in Retirement chose to shine and burn,</l>
                  <l>As ancient Lamps in some <hi>Egyptian</hi> Urn.</l>
                  <l>At last, when spent with sickness, grief and age,</l>
                  <l>Her Guardian Angel did her death presage:</l>
                  <l>(So that by strong impulse she chearfully</l>
                  <l>Dispensed blessings, and went home to die;</l>
                  <l>That so she might, when to that place removed,</l>
                  <l>Marry his Ashes whom she ever loved)</l>
                  <l>She dy'd, gain'd a reward, and paid a debt.</l>
                  <l>The Sun himself did never brighter set.</l>
                  <l>Happy were they that knew her and her end,</l>
                  <l>More happy they that did from her descend:</l>
                  <l>A double blessing they may hope to have,</l>
                  <l>One she convey'd to them, and one she gave.</l>

                  <l>So Honour is its own Reward and End,</l>
                  <l>And satisfi'd within, cannot descend</l>

                  <l>This stamp'd my Innocency in the Ore,</l>

                  <l>And though their Judgment I must still disclaim,</l>

Truth shines so bright there, that an enemy</l>
                  <l>Would be a better Oratour then I.</l>
                  <l>Love stifles Language, and I must confess,</l>
                  <l>I had said more if I had loved less.</l>
                  <l>Yet the most critical who that Face see</l>

                  <l>Others by time and by degrees persuade,</l>
                  <l>But her first look doth every heart invade.</l>
                  <l>She hath a Face so eminently bright,</l>
                  <l>Would make a Lover of an Anchorite:</l>
                  <l>A Face whose conquest mixt with modesty</l>
                  <l>Are both completed in Divinity.</l>
                  <l>Not her least glance but sets them all on fire,</l>
                  <l>And checks them if they would too much aspire.</l>
                  <l>Such is the Magick of her Looks, the same</l>
                  <l>Beam doth both kindle and refine our flame.</l>
                  <l>If she doth smile, no Painter e're would take</l>
                  <l>Another Rule when he would merry make.</l>

And to her splendour Heaven hath allow'd,</l>
                  <l>That not a posture can her Beauty cloud:</l>
                  <l>For if she frown, none but would phansie then</l>
                  <l>Justice descended here to punish Men.</l>
                  <l>Her common looks I know not how to call</l>
                  <l>Any one Grace, they are compos'd of all.</l>
                  <l>And if we Mortals could the doctrine reach,</l>
                  <l>Her Eyes have language, and her Looks do teach,</l>
                  <l>Such is her whole frame, Heaven does afford</l>
                  <l>Her not to be desir'd, but still ador'd.</l>
                  <l>But as in Palaces the outmost worst</l>
                  <l>Rooms entertain our wonder at the first;</l>
                  <l>But once within the Presence-chamber door,</l>
                  <l>We do despise whate're we saw before:</l>
                  <l>So when you with her Mind acquaintance get,</l>
                  <l>You'l hardly think upon the Cabinet,</l>
                  <l>Her Soul, that Ray shot from the Deity,</l>
                  <l>Doth still preserve its native purity;</l>

Which Earth can neither threaten or allure,</l>
                  <l>Nor by false joyes defile it, or obscure.</l>
                  <l>Such Innocence within her heart doth dwell,</l>
                  <l>Angels themselves do onely parallel.</l>
                  <l>And should her whole Sex to dissembling fall,</l>
                  <l>Her own Integrity redeems them all,</l>

                  <l>And all Comparisons but slubber it.</l>
                  <l>More gently soft then is an Evening-shower:</l>
                  <l>And in that sweetness there is coucht a Power;</l>
                  <l>Which scorning pride, doth think it very hard</l>

                  <l>Her Honour is protected by her Eyes,</l>
                  <l>As the old Flaming Sword kept Paradise.</l>
                  <l>Such Constancy of temper, truth and law,</l>
                  <l>Guides all her actions, that the World may draw</l>
                  <l>From her own self the noblest Precedent</l>

She courts Retirement, is herself alone</l>

                  <l>She hath, but is each noble Quality.</l>
                  <l>And as the highest Element is clear</l>
                  <l>From all the Tempests which disturb the Air:</l>
                  <l>So she above the World and its rude noise</l>
                  <l>Within a Storm a quiet Calm enjoys.</l>
                  <l>She scorns the sullen trifles of the Time,</l>
                  <l>But things transcendent do her thoughts sublime.</l>
                  <l>Unlike those Gallants which take far less care</l>

                  <l>WE are complete, and Fate hath now</l>
                  <l>No greater blessing to bestow:</l>
                  <l>No, the dull World must now confess</l>
                  <l>We have all worth, all happiness.</l>
                  <l>Annals of State are trifles to our fame,</l>
                  <l>Now 'tis made sacred by <hi>Lucasia</hi>'s name.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But as though through a Burning-glass</l>
                  <l>The Sun more vigorous doth pass,</l>
                  <l>Yet still with general freedom shines;</l>
                  <l>For that contracts, but not confines:</l>
                  <l>So though by this her beams are fixed here,</l>
                  <l>Yet she diffuses glory every where.</l>

                  <l>Her Mind is so entirely bright,</l>
                  <l>The splendour would but wound our sight,</l>
                  <l>And must to some disguise submit,</l>
                  <l>Or we could never worship it.</l>
                  <l>And we by this relation are allow'd</l>

                  <l>And Pilgrims shall ten Ages hence</l>

                  <hi>XXXVII. Rosannia</hi>'s private Marriage.</head>
               <lg>
                  <l>IT was a wise and kind design of Fate,</l>
                  <l>That none should this day's glory celebrate:</l>
                  <l>For 'twere in vain to keep a time which is</l>
                  <l>Above the reach of all Solemnities.</l>
                  <l>The greatest Actions pass without a noise,</l>
                  <l>And Tumults but prophane diviner Joyes.</l>
                  <l>Silence with things transcendent nearest suits,</l>
                  <l>The greatest Emperours are serv'd by Mutes.</l>
                  <l>And as in ancient time the Deities</l>
                  <l>To their own Priests reveal'd no Mysteries</l>
                  <l>Untill they were from all the World retir'd,</l>
                  <l>And in some Cave made fit to be inspir'd.</l>
                  <l>So when <hi>Rosannia</hi> (who hath them out-vied,</l>
                  <l>And with more Justice might be Deified;</l>

Who if she had their Rites and Altars, we</l>
                  <l>Should hardly think it were Idolatry)</l>
                  <l>Had found a breast that did deserve to be</l>
                  <l>Receptacle of her Divinity;</l>
                  <l>It was not fit the gazing World should know</l>
                  <l>When she convey'd her self to him, or how.</l>
                  <l>An Eagle safely may behold the Sun,</l>
                  <l>When weak Eyes are with too much Light undone.</l>
                  <l>Now as in Oracles were understood,</l>
                  <l>Not the Priests only, but the common good:</l>
                  <l>So her great Soul would not imparted be,</l>
                  <l>But in design of general Charity.</l>
                  <l>She now is more diffusive then before;</l>
                  <l>And what men then admir'd, they now adore.</l>
                  <l>For this Exchange makes not her Power less,</l>
                  <l>But only fitter for the World's Address.</l>
                  <l>May then that Mind (which if we will admit</l>
                  <l>The Universe one Soul, must sure be it)</l>

                  <l>As drousie men do in a cloudy day)</l>

                  <l>Scatter new Blessings for Posterity.</l>
                  <l>I dare not any other wish prefer,</l>
                  <l>For only her bestowing adds to her.</l>

                  <l>Must I be Subject and Spectatour too?</l>
                  <l>Or were the Sufferings and Sins too few</l>
                  <l>To be sustain'd by me, perform'd by you?</l>
                  <l>Unless (with <hi>Nero</hi>) your uncurb'd desire</l>
                  <l>Be to survey the <hi>Rome</hi> you set on fire.</l>
                  <l>While wounded for and by your Power, I</l>
                  <l>At once your Martyr and your Prospect die.</l>
                  <l>This is my doom, and such a ridling Fate</l>

For Obligation here is Injury,</l>
                  <l>Constancy Crime, Friendship a Heresie.</l>
                  <l>And you appear so much on Ruine bent,</l>
                  <l>Your own destruction gives you now Content:</l>
                  <l>For our twinne-Spirits did so long agree,</l>
                  <l>You must undoe your self to ruine me.</l>

                  <l>Kill that which gave you Immortality.</l>
                  <l>While glorious Friendship, whence your Honour springs,</l>
                  <l>Lies gasping in the Croud of common things;</l>
                  <l>And I'me so odious, that for being kind</l>
                  <l>Doubled and studied Murthers are design'd.</l>
                  <l>Thy sin's all Paradox, for should'st thou be</l>
                  <l>Thy self again, th' wouldst be severe to me.</l>
                  <l>For thy Repentance coming now so late,</l>
                  <l>Would only change, and not relieve thy Fate.</l>

So dangerous is the consequence of ill,</l>
                  <l>Thy least of Crimes is to be cruel still.</l>

                  <l>And not to be disturb'd by my distress.</l>
                  <l>And though it would my sacred flames pollute,</l>

                  <l>AS men that are with Visions grac'd</l>
                  <l>Must have all other thoughts displac'd,</l>

                  <l>Made the chief party in its own decay,</l>

                  <l>Felt the same shaft which his own feathers drest.</l>
                  <l>For that great Enemy of Souls perceiv'd,</l>

So closely in Man's Soul; to ruine that,</l>
                  <l>He must at once the World depopulate.</l>
                  <l>But as those Tyrants who their Wills pursue,</l>
                  <l>If they expound old Laws, need make no new:</l>
                  <l>So he advantage takes of Nature's light,</l>
                  <l>And raises that to a bare useless height;</l>
                  <l>Or while we seek for Truth, he in the Quest</l>
                  <l>Mixes a Passion, or an Interest,</l>
                  <l>To make us lose it; that, I know not how,</l>
                  <l>'Tis not our Practice, but our Quarrel now.</l>
                  <l>And as in th' Moon's Eclipse some Pagans thought</l>
                  <l>Their barbarous Clamours her deliverance wrought:</l>
                  <l>So we suppose that Truth oppressed lies,</l>
                  <l>And needs a Rescue from our Enmities.</l>
                  <l>But 'tis Injustice, and the Mind's Disease,</l>
                  <l>To think of gaining Truth by losing Peace.</l>
                  <l>Knowledge and Love, if true, do still unite;</l>
                  <l>God's Love and Knowledge are both Infinite.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:61894:70"/>
And though indeed Truth does delight to lie</l>
                  <l>At some Remoteness from a Common Eye;</l>
                  <l>Yet 'tis not in a Thunder or a Noise,</l>
                  <l>But in soft Whispers and the stiller Voice.</l>
                  <l>Why should we then Knowledge so rudely treat,</l>
                  <l>Making our weapon what was meant our meat?</l>
                  <l>'Tis Ignorance that makes us quarrel so;</l>
                  <l>The Soul that's dark will be contracted too.</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Chimaera's</hi> make a noise, swelling and vain,</l>
                  <l>And soon resolve to their own smoak again.</l>
                  <l>But a true Light the spirit doth dilate,</l>
                  <l>And robs it of its proud and sullen state;</l>
                  <l>Makes Love admir'd because 'tis understood,</l>
                  <l>And makes us Wise because it makes us Good.</l>
                  <l>'Tis to a right Prospect of things that we</l>
                  <l>Owe our Uprightness and our Charity.</l>
                  <l>For who resists a beam when shining bright,</l>
                  <l>Is not a Sinner of a common height.</l>

                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:61894:70"/>
That state's a forfeiture, and helps are spent,</l>
                  <l>Not more a Sin then 'tis a Punishment.</l>
                  <l>The Soul which sees things in their Native frame,</l>
                  <l>Without Opinion's Mask or Custom's name,</l>
                  <l>Cannot be clogg'd to Sense, or count that high</l>
                  <l>Which hath its Estimation from a Lie.</l>
                  <l>(Mean sordid things, which by mistake we prize,</l>
                  <l>And absent covet, but enjoy'd despise.)</l>
                  <l>But scorning these hath robb'd them of their art,</l>
                  <l>Either to swell or to subdue the Heart;</l>
                  <l>And learn'd that generous frame to be above</l>
                  <l>The World in hopes, below it all in love:</l>
                  <l>Touch'd with Divine and Inward Life doth run,</l>
                  <l>Not resting till it hath its Centre won;</l>
                  <l>Moves steadily untill it safe doth lie</l>
                  <l>I'th' Root of all its Immortality;</l>
                  <l>And resting here hath yet activity</l>

                  <l>Who by obeying vindicate her too:</l>
                  <l>For that rich Beam of Heaven was almost</l>

                  <l>Till you by great Example did convince</l>
                  <l>Us of her nature and her residence,</l>
                  <l>And chose to shew her face, and ease her grief,</l>
                  <l>Less by your Arguments then by your Life;</l>
                  <l>Which, if it should be copied out, would be</l>
                  <l>A solid Body of Divinity.</l>
                  <l>Your Principle and Practice light would give</l>
                  <l>What we should doe, and what we should believe:</l>
                  <l>For the extensive Knowledge you profess,</l>
                  <l>You do acquire with more ease then confess.</l>
                  <l>And as by you Knowledge has thus obtain'd</l>

                  <l>Yet those vast Parts with such a Temper meet,</l>

                  <l>Nor is it half so bold as it is true,</l>

                  <l>We see in you how much that Malice ly'd</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>THough it be just to grieve when I must part</l>
                  <l>With him that is the Guardian of my Heart;</l>
                  <l>Yet by an happy change the loss of mine</l>
                  <l>Is with advantage paid in having thine.</l>
                  <l>And I (by that dear Guest instructed) find</l>
                  <l>Absence can doe no hurt to Souls combin'd.</l>
                  <l>As we were born to love, brought to agree</l>
                  <l>By the impressions of Divine Decree:</l>
                  <l>So when united nearer we became,</l>
                  <l>It did not weaken, but increase, our Flame.</l>
                  <l>Unlike to those who distant joys admire,</l>
                  <l>But slight them when possest of their desire.</l>
                  <l>Each of our Souls did in its temper fit,</l>
                  <l>And in the other's Mould so fashion'd it,</l>

                  <l>Passion can ne're destroy, nor Fate surprize.</l>

                  <l>So I, by secret Sympathy inclin'd,</l>
                  <l>Will absent meet, and underst and thy mind;</l>
                  <l>And thou at thy return shalt find thy Heart</l>
                  <l>Still safe, with all the love thou didst impart.</l>
                  <l>For though that treasure I have ne're deserv'd,</l>
                  <l>It shall with strong Religion be preserv'd.</l>
                  <l>And besides this thou shalt in me survey</l>

                  <l>For what some forward Arts do undertake,</l>
                  <l>The Images of absent Friends to make,</l>

Nature subsists by Love, and they do tie</l>
                  <l>Things to their Causes but by Sympathy.</l>

                  <l>And as on Earth, so the blest Quire above</l>
                  <l>Of Saints and Angels are maintain'd by Love;</l>
                  <l>That is their Business and Felicity,</l>
                  <l>And will be so to all Eternity.</l>
                  <l>That is the Ocean, our Affections here</l>
                  <l>Are but streams borrow'd from the Fountain there.</l>
                  <l>And 'tis the noblest Argument to prove</l>

                  <l>For Love is all the Arts Epitome,</l>
                  <l>And is the Sum of all Divinity.</l>
                  <l>He's worse then Beast that cannot Love, and yet</l>

For no change or design can Spirits move,</l>

                  <l>It is what they and none but they can doe.</l>
                  <l>This, this is Friendship, that abstracted flame</l>
                  <l>Which groveling Mortals know not how to name;</l>
                  <l>All Love is sacred, and the Marriage-tie</l>
                  <l>Hath much of Honour and Divinity.</l>
                  <l>But Lust, Design, or some unworthy ends</l>
                  <l>May mingle there, which are despis'd by Friends.</l>
                  <l>Passion hath violent extreams, and thus</l>
                  <l>All oppositions are contiguous.</l>
                  <l>So when the end is serv'd their Love will bate,</l>
                  <l>If Friendship make it not more fortunate:</l>
                  <l>Friendship, that Love's Elixir, that pure fire</l>
                  <l>Which burns the clearer 'cause it burns the higher.</l>
                  <l>For Love, like earthly fires (which will decay</l>
                  <l>If the material fuel be away)</l>

Is with offensive smoke accompanied,</l>
                  <l>And by resistance only is supplied:</l>

                  <l>With its own Heat and Nourishment content,</l>

                  <l>Scorns the assistance of a forein aid.</l>
                  <l>Friendship (like Heraldry) is hereby known,</l>

                  <l>Who scorns to envy Truth where e're it be,</l>

                  <l>Whose house no Orphan groans do shake or blast,</l>

Who from the top of his Prosperities</l>
                  <l>Can take a fall, and yet without surprize;</l>

                  <l>HOw Sacred and how Innocent</l>
                  <l>A Country-life appears,</l>
                  <l>How free from Tumult, Discontent,</l>
                  <l>From Flattery or Fears!</l>
                  <l>This was the first and happiest Life,</l>
                  <l>When man enjoy'd himself;</l>
                  <l>Till Pride exchanged Peace for Strife,</l>
                  <l>And Happiness for Pelf.</l>
                  <l>'Twas here the Poets were inspir'd,</l>
                  <l>And sang their Mysteries;</l>
                  <l>And while the listning World admir'd,</l>
                  <l>Mens Minds did civilize.</l>
                  <l>That Golden Age did entertain</l>
                  <l>No Passion but of Love;</l>

The thoughts of Ruling and of Gain</l>
                  <l>Did ne're their Fancies move.</l>
                  <l>None then did envy Neighbour's wealth,</l>
                  <l>Nor Plot to wrong his bed:</l>
                  <l>Happy in Friendship and in Health,</l>
                  <l>On Roots, not Beasts, they fed.</l>
                  <l>They knew no Law nor Physick then,</l>
                  <l>Nature was all their Wit.</l>
                  <l>And if there yet remain to men</l>
                  <l>Content, sure this is it.</l>
                  <l>What Blessings doth this World afford</l>
                  <l>To tempt or bribe desire?</l>
                  <l>For Courtship is all Fire and Sword,</l>
                  <l>Who would not then retire?</l>
                  <l>Then welcome dearest Solitude,</l>
                  <l>My great Felicity;</l>
                  <l>Though some are pleas'd to call thee rude,</l>
                  <l>Thou art not so, but we.</l>

Such as do covet only rest</l>
                  <l>A Cottage will suffice:</l>
                  <l>Is it not brave to be possest</l>
                  <l>Of Earth but to despise?</l>
                  <l>Opinion is the rate of things,</l>
                  <l>From hence our Peace doth flow;</l>
                  <l>I have a better Fate then Kings,</l>
                  <l>Because I think it so.</l>
                  <l>When all the stormy World doth wear,</l>
                  <l>How unconcern'd am I:</l>
                  <l>I cannot fear to tumble lower</l>
                  <l>That never could be high.</l>
                  <l>Secure in these unenvi'd walls</l>
                  <l>I think not on the State,</l>
                  <l>And pity no mans case that falls</l>
                  <l>From his Ambition's height,</l>
                  <l>Silence and Innocence are safe;</l>
                  <l>A heart that's nobly true</l>

At all these little Arts can laugh</l>
                  <l>That do the World subdue.</l>
                  <l>While others Revel it in State,</l>
                  <l>Here I'le contented sit,</l>
                  <l>And think I have as good a Fate</l>
                  <l>As Wealth and Pomp admit.</l>

                  <l>While Vanity playes all their Game,</l>

                  <hi>LXII.</hi> To Mrs. <hi>Wogan,</hi> my Honoured Friend, on the Death of her Husband.</head>
               <lg>
                  <l>DRy up your tears, there's enough shed by you,</l>
                  <l>And we must pay our share of Sorrows too.</l>
                  <l>It is no private loss when such men fall,</l>
                  <l>The World's concern'd, and Grief is general.</l>
                  <l>But though of our Misfortune we complain,</l>
                  <l>To him it is injurious and vain.</l>
                  <l>For since we know his rich Integrity,</l>
                  <l>His real Sweetness, and full Harmony;</l>
                  <l>How free his heart and house were to his Friends,</l>
                  <l>Whom he oblig'd without Design or Ends;</l>
                  <l>How universal was his Courtesie,</l>
                  <l>How clear a Soul, how even, and how high;</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:61894:100"/>
How much he scorn'd disguise or meaner Arts,</l>
                  <l>But with a native Honour conquer'd Hearts;</l>
                  <l>We must conclude he was a Treasure lent,</l>
                  <l>Soon weary of this sordid Tenement.</l>
                  <l>The Age and World deserv'd him not, and he</l>
                  <l>Was kindly snatch'd from future Misery.</l>
                  <l>We can scarce say he's Dead, but gone to rest,</l>
                  <l>And left a Monument in ev'ry breast.</l>
                  <l>For you to grieve then in this sad excess,</l>
                  <l>Is not to speak your Love, but make it less.</l>
                  <l>A noble Soul no Friendship will admit,</l>
                  <l>But what's Eternal and Divine as it.</l>
                  <l>The Soul is hid in mortal flesh we know,</l>
                  <l>And all its weaknesses must undergo,</l>
                  <l>Till by degrees it does shine forth at length,</l>
                  <l>And gathers Beauty, Purity, and Strength:</l>
                  <l>But never yet doth this Immortal Ray</l>
                  <l>Put on full splendour till it put off Day.</l>

So Infant Love is in the worthiest breast</l>
                  <l>By Sense and Passion fetter'd and opprest;</l>
                  <l>But by degrees it grows still more refin'd,</l>
                  <l>And scorning clogs only concerns the Mind.</l>
                  <l>Now as the Soul you lov'd is here set free</l>
                  <l>From its material gross capacity;</l>
                  <l>Your Love should follow him now he is gone,</l>
                  <l>And quitting Passion, put Perfection on.</l>
                  <l>Such Love as this will its own good deny,</l>
                  <l>If its dear Object have Felicity.</l>
                  <l>And since we cannot his great Loss Reprieve,</l>
                  <l>Let's not lose you in whom he still doth Live.</l>
                  <l>For while you are by Grief secluded thus,</l>
                  <l>It doth appear your Funeral to us.</l>

               <head>LXIII. <hi>In memory of the most justly honoured, Mrs.</hi> Owen <hi>of</hi> Orielton.</head>
               <lg>
                  <l>AS when the ancient World by Reason liv'd,</l>
                  <l>The <hi>Asian</hi> Monarchs deaths were never griev'd;</l>
                  <l>Their glorious Lives made all their Subjects call</l>
                  <l>Their Rites a Triumph, not a Funeral:</l>
                  <l>So still the Good are Princes, and their Fate</l>
                  <l>Invites us not to weep, but imitate.</l>
                  <l>Nature intends a progress of each stage</l>
                  <l>Whereby weak Man creeps to succeeding Age,</l>
                  <l>Ripens him for that Change for which he's made,</l>
                  <l>Where th' active Soul is in her Centre laid.</l>
                  <l>And since none stript of Infancy complain,</l>
                  <l>Cause 'tis both their necessity and gain:</l>
                  <l>So Age and Death by slow approches come,</l>
                  <l>And by that just inevitable doom</l>

                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:61894:102"/>
By which the Soul (her cloggy dross once gone)</l>
                  <l>Puts on Perfection, and resumes her own.</l>
                  <l>Since then we mourn a happy Soul, O why</l>
                  <l>Disturb we her with erring Piety?</l>
                  <l>Who's so enamour'd on the beauteous Ground,</l>
                  <l>When with rich Autumn's livery hung round,</l>
                  <l>As to deny a Sickle to his Grain,</l>
                  <l>And not undress the teeming Earth again?</l>
                  <l>Fruits grow for use, Mankind is born to die;</l>
                  <l>And both Fates have the same necessity.</l>
                  <l>Then grieve no more, sad Relatives, but learn;</l>
                  <l>Sigh not, but profit by your just concern.</l>
                  <l>Reade over her Life's volume: wise and good,</l>
                  <l>Not 'cause she must be so, but 'cause she wou'd.</l>
                  <l>To chosen Vertue still a constant friend,</l>
                  <l>She saw the Times which chang'd, but did not mend.</l>
                  <l>And as some are so civil to the Sun,</l>
                  <l>They'd fix his beams, and make the Earth to run:</l>

                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:61894:102"/>
So she unmov'd beheld the angry Fate</l>
                  <l>Which tore a Church, and overthrew a State:</l>
                  <l>Still durst be Good, and own the noble Truth,</l>
                  <l>To crown her Age which had adorn'd her Youth.</l>
                  <l>Great without Pride, a Soul which still could be</l>
                  <l>Humble and high, full of calm Majesty.</l>
                  <l>She kept true state within, and could not buy</l>
                  <l>Her Satisfaction with her Charity.</l>
                  <l>Fortune or Birth ne're rais'd her Mind, which stood</l>
                  <l>Not on her being rich, but doing good.</l>
                  <l>Oblig'd the World, but yet would scorn to be</l>
                  <l>Paid with Requitals, Thanks or Vanity.</l>
                  <l>How oft did she what all the World adore,</l>
                  <l>Make the Poor happy with her useful store?</l>
                  <l>So general was her Bounty, that she gave</l>
                  <l>Equality to all before the Grave.</l>
                  <l>By several means she different persons ty'd,</l>
                  <l>Who by her Goodness onely were ally'd.</l>

                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:61894:103"/>
Her Vertue was her Temper, not her Fit;</l>
                  <l>Fear'd nothing but the Crimes which some commit</l>
                  <l>Scorn'd those dark Arts w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> pass for Wisdom now</l>
                  <l>Nor to a mean ignoble thing could bow.</l>
                  <l>And her vast Prudence had no other end,</l>
                  <l>But to forgive a Foe, endear a Friend:</l>
                  <l>To use, but slight, the World; and fixt above,</l>
                  <l>Shine down in beams of Piety and Love.</l>
                  <l>Why should we then by poor and just complaint</l>
                  <l>Prove envious Sinners 'cause she is a Saint?</l>
                  <l>Close then the Monument; let not a Tear</l>

                  <l>The Being and the Harmony of things,</l>

                  <l>Friendship's an Abstract of this noble Flame,</l>
                  <l>'Tis Love refin'd and purg'd from all its dross,</l>
                  <l>The next to Angels Love, if not the same,</l>
                  <l>As strong in passion is, though not so gross</l>

                  <l>It self doth onely by this Union stand,</l>
                  <l>And turns to Friendship or to Misery.</l>
                  <l>Force or Design Matches to pass may bring,</l>
                  <l>But Friendship doth from Love and Honour spring.</l>

                  <l>Women from Friendship's vast capacity,</l>
                  <l>Is a Design injurious or rude,</l>
                  <l>Onely maintain'd by partial tyranny.</l>
                  <l>Love is allow'd to us and Innocence,</l>
                  <l>And noblest Friendships do proceed from thence.</l>

                  <l>The chiefest thing in Friends is Sympathy:</l>
                  <l>There is a Secret that doth Friendship guide,</l>

                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:61894:104"/>
Which makes two Souls before they know agree,</l>
                  <l>Who by a thousand mixtures are ally'd,</l>
                  <l>And chang'd and lost, so that it is not known</l>
                  <l>Within which breast doth now reside their own.</l>

                  <l>Essential Honour must be in a Friend,</l>
                  <l>Not such as every breath fans to and fro;</l>
                  <l>But born within, is its own judge and end,</l>
                  <l>And dares not sin though sure that none should know.</l>
                  <l>Where Friendship's spoke, Honesty's understood;</l>
                  <l>For none can be a Friend that is not Good.</l>

                  <l>Friendship doth carry more then common trust,</l>
                  <l>And Treachery is here the greatest sin.</l>
                  <l>Secrets deposed then none ever must</l>
                  <l>Presume to open, but who put them in.</l>
                  <l>They that in one Chest lay up all their stock,</l>
                  <l>Had need be sure that none can pick the Lock.</l>

                  <l>A breast too open Friendship does not love,</l>
                  <l>For that the others Trust will not conceal;</l>
                  <l>Nor one too much reserv'd can it approve,</l>
                  <l>Its own Condition this will not reveal.</l>
                  <l>We empty Passions for a double end,</l>
                  <l>To be refresh'd and guarded by a Friend.</l>

                  <head>9.</head>
                  <l>Wisdom and Knowledge Friendship does require,</l>
                  <l>The first for Counsel, this for Company;</l>
                  <l>And though not mainly, yet we may desire</l>
                  <l>For complaisance and Ingenuity.</l>
                  <l>Though ev'ry thing may love, yet 'tis a Rule,</l>
                  <l>He cannot be a Friend that is a Fool.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <head>10.</head>
                  <l>Discretion uses Parts, and best knows how;</l>
                  <l>And Patience will all Qualities commend:</l>

                     <pb n="193" facs="tcp:61894:105"/>
That serves a need best, but this doth allow</l>
                  <l>The Weaknesses and Passions of a Friend.</l>
                  <l>We are not yet come to the Quire above:</l>
                  <l>Who cannot Pardon here, can never Love.</l>

                  <l>Thick Waters shew no Images of things;</l>
                  <l>Friends are each others Mirrours, and should be</l>
                  <l>Clearer then Crystal or the Mountain Springs,</l>
                  <l>And free from Clouds, Design or Flattery.</l>
                  <l>For vulgar Souls no part of Friendship share:</l>
                  <l>Poets and Friends are born to what they are.</l>

                  <head>12.</head>
                  <l>Friends should observe &amp; chide each others Faults,</l>
                  <l>To be severe then is most just and kind;</l>
                  <l>Nothing can 'scape their search who know the thoughts:</l>
                  <l>This they should give and take with equal Mind.</l>
                  <l>For Friendship, when this Freedom is deny'd,</l>
                  <l>Is like a Painter when his hands are ty'd.</l>

                  <l>A Friend should find out each Necessity,</l>

                  <l>It is not Friendship, but Formality,</l>
                  <l>To be desir'd; for Kindness keeps no state.</l>
                  <l>Of Friends he doth the Benefactour prove,</l>
                  <l>That gives his Friend a means t' express his Love.</l>

                  <l>Absence doth not from Friendship's right excuse:</l>
                  <l>They who preserve each others heart and fame</l>
                  <l>Parting can ne're divide, it may diffuse;</l>
                  <l>As Liquors which asunder are the same.</l>
                  <l>Though Presence help'd them at the first to greet,</l>
                  <l>Their Souls know now without those aids to meet.</l>
               </lg>

                  <head>15.</head>
                  <l>Constant and Solid, whom no storms can shake,</l>
                  <l>Nor death unfix, a right Friend ought to be;</l>

And if condemned to survive, doth make</l>
                  <l>No second choice, but Grief and Memory.</l>
                  <l>But Friendship's best Fate is, when it can spend</l>
                  <l>A Life, a Fortune, all to serve a Friend.</l>

                  <l>'Tis Hardship only makes Desert complete.</l>
                  <l>But yet to prove Mixtures all things compound,</l>
                  <l>There may in this be some advantage found;</l>
                  <l>For a Retirement from the noise of Towns,</l>
                  <l>Is that for which someKings have left their Crowns:</l>

And Conquerours, whose Laurel prest the brow,</l>
                  <l>Have chang'd it for the quiet Myrtle-bow.</l>
                  <l>For Titles, Honours, and the World's Address,</l>
                  <l>Are things too cheap to make up Happiness;</l>
                  <l>The easie Tribute of a giddy race,</l>
                  <l>And pay'd less to the Person then the place.</l>
                  <l>So false reflected and so short content</l>
                  <l>Is that which Fortune and Opinion lent,</l>

                  <l>With Titles burthen'd and to Greatness chain'd.</l>
                  <l>For they alone enjoy'd what they possest,</l>
                  <l>Who relisht most and understood it best.</l>
                  <l>And yet that understanding made them know</l>
                  <l>The empty swift dispatch of all below.</l>
                  <l>So that what most can outward things endear,</l>
                  <l>Is the best means to make them disappear:</l>

Thus all the glittering World is but a cheat,</l>

                  <l>A Country-life assists this study best,</l>
                  <l>Where no distractions do the Soul arrest:</l>

                  <l>No secret cunning then nor multitude</l>

                  <l>Nay, what can be so wearisome a pain</l>
                  <l>As when no Alterations entertain?</l>
                  <l>To lose, to suffer, to be sick and die,</l>
                  <l>Arrest us by the same Necessity.</l>
                  <l>Nor could they trouble us, but that our mind</l>
                  <l>Hath its own glory unto dross confin'd.</l>
                  <l>For outward things remove not from their place,</l>
                  <l>Till our Souls run to beg their mean embrace;</l>
                  <l>Then doating on the choice make it our own,</l>
                  <l>By placing Trifles in th' Opinion's Throne.</l>
                  <l>So when they are divorc'd by some new cross,</l>
                  <l>Our Souls seem widow'd by the fatal loss:</l>
                  <l>But could we keep our Grandeur and our state,</l>
                  <l>Nothing below would seem unfortunate;</l>
                  <l>But Grace and Reason, which best succours bring,</l>
                  <l>Would with advantage manage every thing;</l>

                     <pb n="213" facs="tcp:61894:115"/>
And by right Judgment would prevent our moan</l>
                  <l>For losing that which never was our own.</l>
                  <l>For right Opinion's like a Marble grott,</l>
                  <l>In Summer cool, and in the Winter hot;</l>
                  <l>A Principle which in each Fortune lives,</l>
                  <l>Bestowing Catholick Preservatives.</l>
                  <l>'Tis this resolves, there are no losses where</l>
                  <l>Vertue and Reason are continued there.</l>
                  <l>The meanest Soul might such a Fortune share,</l>
                  <l>But no mean Soul could so that Fortune bear.</l>
                  <l>Thus I compose my thoughts grown insolent,</l>
                  <l>As th' <hi>Irish</hi> harper doth his Instrument;</l>

                  <l>WE falsly think it due unto our Friends,</l>

                  <l>He that surveys the World with serious eyes,</l>

How each Condition hath its proper Thorns,</l>
                  <l>And what one man admires, another scorns;</l>
                  <l>How frequently their Happiness they miss,</l>
                  <l>And so far from agreeing what it is,</l>
                  <l>That the same Person we can hardly find</l>
                  <l>Who is an hour together in one mind:</l>
                  <l>Sure they would beg a Period of their breath,</l>
                  <l>And what we call their Birth would count their Death.</l>
                  <l>Mankind are mad; for none can live alone,</l>
                  <l>Because their Joys stand by comparison:</l>
                  <l>And yet they quarrel at Society,</l>
                  <l>And strive to kill they know not whom, nor why.</l>
                  <l>We all live by Mistake, delight in Dreams,</l>
                  <l>Lost to our selves, and dwelling in Extremes;</l>
                  <l>Rejecting what we have, though ne're so good,</l>
                  <l>And prizing what we never understood.</l>

Hence we reverse the World, and yet do find</l>

                  <l>Freedom of Will (God's Image) is forgot;</l>
                  <l>And, if we know it, we improve it not.</l>
                  <l>Our Thoughts, though nothing can be more our own,</l>
                  <l>Are still unguided, very seldom known.</l>
                  <l>Time 'scapes our hands as Water in a Sieve,</l>
                  <l>We come to die e're we begin to live.</l>
                  <l>Truth, the most sutable and noble prize,</l>
                  <l>Food of our Spirits, yet neglected lies.</l>

Errour and Shadows are our choice, and we</l>

                  <l>If we search Truth, we make it more obscure;</l>
                  <l>And when it shines, we can't the light endure.</l>
                  <l>For most men now, who plod, and eat, and drink,</l>
                  <l>Have nothing less their bus'ness then to think.</l>
                  <l>And those few that enquire, how small a share</l>
                  <l>Of Truth they find, how dark their Notions are!</l>
                  <l>That serious Evenness that calms the Breast,</l>
                  <l>And in a Tempest can bestow a Rest,</l>
                  <l>We either not attempt, or else decline,</l>
                  <l>By ev'ry trifle snatch'd from our design.</l>
                  <l>(Others he must in his deceits involve,</l>
                  <l>Who is not true unto his own Resolve.)</l>
                  <l>We govern not our selves, but loose the Reins,</l>
                  <l>Courting our Bondage to a thousand chains;</l>
                  <l>And with as many Slaveries content</l>

                  <l>We suffer less from bad then from the good.</l>
                  <l>The Sting is better drest and longer lasts,</l>

                  <l>And will improve by all that I have past.</l>
                  <l>I know'twas just I should be practis'd on;</l>
                  <l>For I was told before,</l>
