         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PASSAGE
OUT OF THE
Lord VERULAN'S
Novum Organon,
Tranſlated out of Latine.</head>
            <p>THe Introduction of Noble Inventions
ſeemeth to be the very chief of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
actions, which former Ages ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
witneſſed; in as much as they attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
Divine Honours to ſuch Inventors,
whereas they alotted only the Honour or
Title of Heroes to the well-deſerving in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Affaires; ſuch as are the Founders of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Empires, Law-makers, the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
of their Countrey from long and tedious
miſchiefs, the ſuppreſſions of Tyrannies, and
the like. And truly, whoſoever ſhall well ſcan
the matter, he ſhall find this verdict of the
auucients to be very juſt. For the benefits
of new Inventions may extend to all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
<pb facs="tcp:57934:3"/>
univerſally; but the good of civil at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements
can reſpect but ſome particular
Cantons of men: theſe latter do not endure
above a few ages, the former for ever. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
the Reformation of States in civil affairs
for the moſt part, is not compaſſed without
violence and diſturbances: But Inventions
make all men happy without either injury or
dammage to any one ſingle perſon. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
new Inventions are as it were new Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations,
and Imitations of Gods own works.</p>
            <p>Again, it were good to take notice of the
vertue efficacy, and conſequences of Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which are ſcarce more conſpicuous in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
then in theſe 3. unknown to to the Aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
and whoſe beginnings (although but of
late) are obſcure and unrenowned, to wit, the
Art of Printing, Gunpowder, and the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
Needle. For theſe three have changed the
face and ſtate of things throughout the whole
world. The firſt in the matter of Learning, the
ſecond in that of War, and the laſt in Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
From whence have followed an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
change of things, ſo that no Empire,
no Sect; nor no Conſtellation ſeemeth to have
had a greater influence upon humane affairs
then theſe Mechanical Inventions have had.</p>

CONCERNING
An Invention of Engines of
Motion lately brought to perfection.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas by the bleſſing of God, who only is
the giver of every good and perfect gift,
while I was ſearching after that which
many far before me in all humane learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
have ſought, but not yet found, (<hi>viz.</hi>) a
Perpetual Motion or ſelfmotion, or a leſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the diſtance between ſtrength &amp; time; though I ſay
not that I have yet fully obtained the thing it ſelf, yet I
have advanced ſo near it, that already I can with the
ſtrength or help of 4. men, do any work which is done
in <hi>England,</hi> whether by wind, water, or horſes, as the
grinding of <hi>Wheat, Rape,</hi> or raiſing of waters: Not by
any power or wiſdom of mine own, but by Gods aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
and (I humbly hope after a ſort) immediate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
I have been guided in that ſearch to tread in
another path, then ever any other man that I can hear
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57934:4"/>
or reade of, did tread before me, yet with ſo good ſucces
that I have already erected one little Engine or great
Model at <hi>Lambath,</hi> able to give ſufficient demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to either Artiſt or any other perſon, that my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
is as uſeful and beneficial (let others ſay upon
proof how much more) as any other way of working
hitherto known or uſed.</p>
            <p>Having therefore brought it to the birth, I confeſs I
am pained to be delivered; but want the help of ſome
good Neighbours, or rather the Child being indeed
born, and that kind and faithful Office performed by
your ſelf, without whoſe help as the chief Inſtrument,
I could hardly have brought it forth. The next care is
for a good Nurſe, leſt the Infant periſh for want of
timely nouriſhment. And this alſo I hope to obtain by
your farther negotiation and aſſiſtance, that ſo this ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
may not be hid under a Buſhel, but be imparted
for the general uſe of Mankind, &amp; for the comfort of all
that Family, to whom this ſo hopeful an iſſue doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.
I muſt confeſs ingenuouſly, that if God as the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
cauſe, and your ſelf as his proper Inſtrument,
had not (in a manner alone) ſupported and encouraged
both my ſpirit &amp; hands from time to time, there would
have been little or nothing of it extant at this time, if
the undertaking had not quite miſcarried, ſo good a
Nurſe have you been both to me and it. This (dear Sir)
I ſpeak the rather, that I may encourage you through
the love of God to every good and laudable purpoſe,
not to grow weary in your mind, notwithſtanding that
infinite corruption you meet in the wayes of men to
ſtop your courſe, but to continue ſtill as hitherto you
have done in a courſe of patient well-doing, and to caſt
your bread upon many waters; for aſſuredly of this
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57934:4"/>
ſeed you will reap an abundant Harveſt in due time, if
you faint not; And if this age ſhould not reſent ſo
gratefully as they ought, all the labours of your love;
which you have, and I know more and more intend
to expreſs by the grace of God, for the univerſal good
of the whole Nation: yet Poſterity perhaps may, when
they ſhall conſider now inſtrumental you have been
not only to contribute to the building of many Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of Piety and Learning; but alſo to ſet forwards
the beſt meanes, that can be held forth to any induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
or ingenious people, of livelihood and outward
riches, by a reformed way of Husbandry: Of which that
of ſaving and multiplying Corn is one of the chief and
moſt ſubſtantial parts.</p>
            <p>As for the Invention formerly mentioned, of better
and more accomodate wayes of grinding, my purpoſe
is not (at preſent) to enlarge my ſelf therein, nor men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thoſe very many uſes for which they are to be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
but only to intimate the goodneſs of theſe kind of
Engines, as they ſtand compared to other common
Mills, by a ſhort meaſuring ſcale here incloſed. And ſo
I commend you to Gods favour and bleſſing, as alſo
my ſelf and the whole buſineſs, which is the continued
prayer of</p>

            <head>A Scale to meaſure the Vſes and profits of my Engine by as
it ſtands compared with others. All commonly known
Cauſes of ſtrong and ſwift Motion are concluded
under theſe 6. heads.

               </list>
            </head>
            <p>FOr the firſt, two <hi>viz. Springs</hi> and <hi>Weights,</hi> they are
rather uſed for <hi>Watches,</hi> or <hi>Clocks,</hi> or <hi>Jacks,</hi> then
for <hi>Mill-works,</hi> and are therefore not neceſſary to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of here.</p>
            <p>For the third, <hi>viz.</hi> Men, they are uſed for ſtrong Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
often; but thoſe motions are ſlowe, as craining
up of Goods or the like, and as for <hi>Mill-works,</hi> they are
only uſed for grinding of ſmall quantities of Malt, in
thoſe Engines, commonly called <hi>Quernes</hi> or <hi>Hand-Mills,</hi>
and for turning of grinding-Stones, and for hand-Pumps
which make but ſmall riddance.</p>
            <p>For the fourth <hi>viz. Wind,</hi> this is uſed in great and
ſtrong <hi>Mill-works,</hi> as for the grinding of Corn or Rape,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> for ſawing of Timber, or for draining of drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But theſe Wind-Mills are liable to theſe
Inconveniencies.</p>
            <p>Firſt, they are only to be erected upon Hills, or open
plains, and therefore not uſeful in all places.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they are not without ſome danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
broken, and that not the Sailes only, (which though
frequent are mendable) but ſometimes to be torn in
peeces, yea tumbled quite down by violent and ſuddain
ſtorms, which (though it happen but ſeldom) yet in
reſpect it may ſo be, and in reſpect of the great loſſe,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57934:5"/>
both of life and goods that neceſſarily followes, there
is ſufficient argument to deterre any man from build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch Mills where others (leſſe hazardous) can be
ſet up. Though not to neglect the uſe of them, where
no other can be had.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, ſuch ſtorms and guſtie winds, though they
alwayes break not the whole Mill nor its ſails, yet it
often compels it to ſtand ſtill, or if it go it grinds un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towardly,
ſomtimes too high, preſently too low, and is
apt to heat, &amp;c. And the ſame makes the deale-boards
that are ſawed by ſuch Mills ſo ruffe and ſhagged,
from hence alſo it is that in drayning works of this
nature, the tackling is very apt to break.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Calmes are all the year long, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in Summer ſo frequent, that upon enquiry, I
am confident it will appeare that moſt Wind-Mills
ſtand ſtill above half the year, though not altogether
at one time. And for this cauſe no man will grind
at a Windmil, that can as conveniently grind at a Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Mill;
And he may have griſt when the wind ſerves
not, or want when the wind ſerves.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The Cog-wheels in moſt Wind-Mills are
(in the diameter) 8. foot or under (I take the example
from one of the beſt Wind-Mills in Moore-fields,
which I think is not much inferiour to any in <hi>England</hi>)
the trundle is at the leaſt two foot, which is 4. to one.
Now I have obſerved in a pretty ſtiffe gale, that the
ſailes, and conſequently the Cog-wheele hath gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
8. times in a minute, that is 24. turnes in a minute
for the ſtones: And for the moſt part of the time they
work, it is not much above this rate, which cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
above 3. buſhels in one houre, but a good Mill
of mine may grind a quarter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:57934:6"/>
The 5th. principle of Motion is Water, or the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Mills:
Theſe alſo are lyable to ſome inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
            <p>Firſt, if the foundation be not carefully and skilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
laid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all is in danger to be eradicated.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if the banks of the dam break, the water
runs the wrong way.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in great floods ſhe ſtirs not.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, in droughts in Summer moſt VVater-Mils
want water.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, not one of a hundred hath water at any
time of the year to ſerve day and night too, unleſſe
they go very weakly and ſo diſpatch but little.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, he that will erect a VVater-Mill is bound to
ſet it up where Nature hath provided a ſufficient
ſtreame, and cannot have one elſewhere upon any
termes.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, (although VVater-Mills be of all other the
beſt yet known or uſed yet) one with the other through
<hi>England,</hi> will not grind above foure buſhells in an
hour; whereas a good Mil of mine wil (as is aforeſaid)
grind a quarter or more; therefore hath a manifeſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of all other Mills, and eſpecially in this, that
the profit and charge of mine are preſent or abſent to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>gether,
ſo that no cuſtom or profit, not a penny
charge.</p>
            <p>The Sixt and laſt Principle of Motion is the Horſe-Mill,
(I have heard they uſe Oxen in the Barbado's)
Theſe (though weaker then wind, or VVater-Mills)
are the beſt, for ſo much as they can do, in reſpect they
may be ſet up, and made uſe of almoſt at all times and
places, and are lyable to ſome defects or inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
though fewer then the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:57934:6"/>
Firſt, If any or all the Horſes dye or be dangerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſick, the dead horſe what ever he coſt or was worth,
is clearly loſt to the Maſter, and the ſick muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
and maintained idle till recovered.</p>
            <p>Secondly, (and this is the only moſt conſiderable
defect or difference, between mine and this, and that
is a great one indred) The horſe Mill is abſolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of being carried on to the grinding of Corne
or ſuch ſtrong wrks: For, The Brewers Mills
(the beſt or greateſt, I mean now uſed in <hi>London</hi>)
move by the ſtrength of 4 horſes under a wheele of
24 foot diameter, which may contain at 4 Inches
pitch 216 Cogs, the horſes path is not above 18
foot, ſo that the Cog-wheel over-hangs one further
part, theſe Horſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one time with ano<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>her, draw not
above 112 pound weight apiece at moſt, and move
(at moſt) 3 times about in a minute, the whole
ſtrength of the 4 is 448. out of which deduct one 4th.
part, there remains 336. And 216 Cogs is 648. Cogs
at work in a minute, theſe work upon a ſtone of 4 foot
it may be 4. and a halfe, by a trundle of one foot,
or 9 ſtaves at the ſame pitch, (if of 10 ſtaves it goes
ſtronger but ſlower) by this account 72 is the reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
number of turnes, the ſtone runs about in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute.</p>
            <p>Note that if this Mill were to grind Wheat with
the ſame ſtone, it could not move by this trundle, nor
with this ſterngth, and a larger trundle would not turn
the ſtone ſo oft in a minute, whereas my Engine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for Wheat, will bring at leaſt twice ſo much
ſtrength with the Cogs, yet turne the ſtone at leaſt 72
times in a minute.</p>
            <p>Let this ſerve as a Scale to meaſure all other Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57934:7"/>
by; for what ever wil hold in grinding Wheat,
will hold (to give the advantage to my Engines) much
more in any other Application, and particularly for
Grinding or ſqueeſing of Sugar-Canes, and raiſing
water; for which laſt I have an Invention yet to come
far above this or any thing hitherto knowne (as I at
leaſt) humbly conceave.)</p>

            <p>Having thus according to your commands given
you an accompt in part of theſe things; give me leave
by way of repetition to give you as it wer an abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this whole buſineſſe for a cloſe; that ſo you
may in a cloſer order review what perfection God
hath brought this work unto; to the intent we may the
more rejoyce in and admire his goodneſſe, &amp; the more
admire but lament the dulneſſe of this preſent Age, in
which there is ſo few that will pull their hands out of
their boſoms to receive ſo great bleſſings. The happy
ſucceſſe of my Endeavours have arrived at this.</p>
            <p>To chooſe the beſt ground, or fitteſt for the then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
purpoſe, which if it be already good and rich e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
'tis well; but if not, To know not only all the
Common ſorts of Dung, Manures, or Compoſts,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57934:8"/>
with their Common uſes, but divers others perhaps
of better uſe, and a diſtinct and better uſe of thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
known (in a word) ſo as that out of any twenty
Acres in <hi>England,</hi> that lyes together, and is in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of goodneſſe, to take right good and ſufficient
Compoſt for that 20. Acres, and that from generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to generation, &amp; that in ſuch a ſort that the ground
ſhall be continually rather improved and of more
profit thereby, if the owners will themſelves; and alſo
to the great eaſe of many parts of <hi>England,</hi> where
their tillage Lands lye far from home; To make two
loads of Dung or other Compoſt more effectuall then
ten is now. This Land thus choſen and ſoyled, to
plough after a better and more advantageous manner,
with cattel, or if need be, to plough or dig wi<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hout
cattel as cheap, and as faſt as now, (this is more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to the Publique then the Private, though no
loſſe to any.) To ſow, or rather to ſet or plant in a
way ſo much ſuperiour and more advantageous then
the common way as is hard to beleeve. This Land
thus ſowed, ſet, or planted, to manage the Crop when
above ground yet more to a double advantage by
wayes not formerly known or hardly thought on.</p>
            <p>The Crop thus come up to be inned, and preſerved
till thraſhed with more ſafety; and if Barely, &amp;c. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
malted to dry better and far cheaper, if hard c<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rne
to grind by virtue of the Engines or Mills aboveſaid,
if Rape-ſeed or the like to grind and make into oyle,
if Hemp or Flax, &amp;c. to brake and beat, &amp;c. And for
Corn, to thraſh if need be, with leſſe charge and more
expedition far, but this I will never conſent to make
common till I perceive that there is other wayes actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
on foot to ſet the poore on work, or that we want
hands to diſpatch our neceſſary buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:57934:8"/>
The Corn however thraſht to winnow great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
without ſtaying for the wind as ſome doe, or
without taking a whole family from all other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
as others doe, and without thoſe many loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
charges, inconveniences that attend this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
too commonly throughout <hi>England,</hi> yet ſhal the
corn be cleaner dreſt by much: and that ſo ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
to anſwer your own deſires, which is very often
fruſtrated in the uſefull way, eſpecially where there is
great quantities: The charge to every great Corne-Maſter
will not be great to erect or prepare, but the
benefit much more then he himſelfe thinkes of, or
will eaſily beleeve till experience hath indeared him
to it; for a taſt, conſider what advantage it will be
(after preparation made) to keep your corne in the
chaffe, free from Hogs or Hens, or two-legged or
foure-handed Thieves, &amp;c. free from the danger of
heating or growing as long as you pleaſe, and at an
hours warning to make purely cleane as little or as
much as you pleaſe, without any more then one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
engaged, except for very great quantities, and then
but two at moſt, and that but for a while; from hence
we can for a need draw it without cattell into the field
to ſowe, or into the Market to ſel; and ſo this double
invention never forſakes the good husband, till his
hands be quit of it till next year, or for ever.</p>
            <p>And if any ground be over-flowed againſt the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
will, or to his hurt, the Engine is ready to dreſſe
it and lay it dry; or if too dry by nature to flood it; or if
too dry by accident, that is by drought, to water it,
morning or evening as there is cauſe with more eaſe,
leſſe charge, and a more regular way by farre, then
any Garden is watred, ſo ſhall thy Crop flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57934:9"/>
when thy neighbours (that takes not the ſame
courſe) ſhal fade away. And in ground that affords any
Coale-pits, or other deep Mines, it will take them up
with more eaſe, ſpeed, and leſſe charge; or if you build
a ſtately houſe, the Engine will much facilitate the
work both in reſpect of time and charge.</p>
            <p>Finally, By the bleſſing of the ſame God, there
are begotten by the ſame Father Induſtry, and concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the ſame Mother Ingenuity, ſome other off-ſprings
of no ſmall or leſſe uſe; in order to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of the Lives and Eſtates of very many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands;
from or in the moſt common and eminent
dangers, and to perſwade and prevaile with the Sea
alſo, to diſcloſe and impart her treaſury whether
her own naturally, or that of which ſhe hath robbed us.</p>
            <p>But firſt let us ſee what kind entertainment the
world will give to theſe before any others ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
If the Land be converted to paſture for Sheep,
the Engine will full the cloath.</p>
            <p>If for a dayry, it will churn the cream into butter.</p>
            <p>If to feed or breed cattell, it will grind bark that tans
the skins.</p>
            <p>And if for planting and nouriſhing of Timber, the
ſame Engine will ſaw it to great gaine and advantage.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee there is ſo neere an allyance between
theſe two Inventions, and both ſo agree to aſsiſt and
reward the good Husband, that there is no eſſentiall
part of Husbandry, wherein they do not naturally aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
each other more or leſſe. I remaine alwayes</p>
