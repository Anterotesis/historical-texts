            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>VHo doubteth (Chriſtian Reader) but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie muſt be under the courteſie and mercy of malice, and that it is a reall mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome, to be brought under the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Inquiſition of the bloody tongue? Chriſt, the Prophets and Apoſtles of our Lord, went to Heaven with the note of Traytors, Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, and ſuch <hi>as turned the world upſide down:</hi> calumnies of treaſon to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> were an ingredient in Chriſts cup, and therefore the author is the more willing to drink of that cup that touched his lip, who is our glorious forerunner: what if conſcience toward <hi>God,</hi> and credit with men, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not both go to heaven with the Saints, the author is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied with the former companion, and is willing to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe the other. Truth to Chriſt, cannot be treaſon to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and for his choiſe he judgeth truth to have a nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer relation to Chriſt Jeſus, then the tranſcendent and boundleſſe power of a mortall Prince.</p>
            <p>He conſidered that Popery and defection had made a large ſtep in <hi>Britain,</hi> and that Arbitrary Government had over-ſwelled all banks of Law, that it was now at the higheſt float, and that this ſea approaching the fartheſt border of fancied abſolutenes, was at the ſcore of ebbing: and the naked truth is, Prelats, a wild and puſhing cattle to the lambs and flock of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> had made a hideous noyſe, the wheeles of their chariot did run an equall pace with the blood-thirſty mind of the <hi>Daughter of Babell.</hi> Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, <hi>the daughter planted in her mothers blood,</hi> muſt verifie that word, <hi>As is the mother, ſo is the daughter:</hi> why, but
<pb facs="tcp:119219:4"/>
do not the Prelates now ſuffer? True, but their ſuffrings are not of blood, or kindred, to the calamities of theſe of whom <hi>Lactantius</hi> ſaith, <hi>l. 5. c. 19. O quam honeſta vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntate miſeri erant.</hi> The cauſes of their ſuffring are, 1. Hope of gain and glory, ſtirring their Helme to a ſhoare they much affect; even to a Church of Gold, of Purple, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of clay and earth. 2. The lye is more active upon the ſpirits of men, not becauſe of its own weakneſſe, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men are more paſſive in receiving the impreſſions of error, then truth; and opinions lying in the worlds fat wombe, are of a conquering nature, what ever notions ſide with the world, to Prelates and men of their make are very efficacious.</p>
            <p>There is another cauſe of the ſickneſſe of our time; <hi>God</hi> plagued Hereſie, to beget Atheiſme and ſecurity, as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme and ſecurity had begotten Hereſie, even as clouds through reciprocation of cauſes engender rain, rain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate vapours, vapours clouds, and clouds rain, ſo do ſins overſpread our ſad times in a circular generation.</p>
            <p>And now judgement preſſeth the kingdoms, and of all the heavieſt judgements the ſword, and of ſwords the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill ſword, threatneth vaſtation, yet not, I hope, like the Roman civill ſword, of which it was ſaid,

which he laboureth to prove how inconſiſtent presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall government is with Monarchy, or any other go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>1 He denyeth that the Crown and Scepter is under any coactive power of Pope, or Presbiterie, or cenſurable, or dethroneable: to which we ſay, Presbyteries profeſſe that <hi>Kings</hi> are under the coactive power of <hi>Chriſts</hi> keyes of diſcipline, and that <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Paſtors,</hi> as Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> have the <hi>keyes of the kingdom of God,</hi> to open and let in beleeving Princes, and alſo to ſhut them out, if they rebel againſt <hi>Chriſt;</hi> the law of <hi>Chriſt</hi> excepteth none, <hi>Mat. 16. 19. Mat. 18. 15, 16. 2 Cor. 10. 6. Jer.</hi> 1. 9. 18. if the <hi>Kings</hi> ſins may be remitted in a miniſteriall way, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 23, 24. as Prelates and their Prieſts abſolve <hi>Kings;</hi> we think they may be bound by the hand that looſed, Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries never dethroned <hi>Kings,</hi> never uſurped that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; Your father P. Prelate, hath dethroned many <hi>Kings;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sacr. ſan. reg. maj. c. 5.</note> I mean the <hi>Pope,</hi> whoſe power, by your own confeſſion <hi>cap. 5. pag.</hi> 58. differeth <hi>from yours by divine right, only in extent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 <hi>When ſacred Hierarchy, the order inſtituted by Chriſt, is overthrown, what is the condition of Soveraignty? Anſ.</hi> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer then before, when <hi>Prelates</hi> depoſed <hi>Kings.</hi> 2. I fear Chriſt ſhall never own this order.</p>
            <p>3 <hi>The Mitre cannot ſuffer, and the Diadem be ſecured. Anſ.</hi> Have <hi>Kings</hi> no pillars to their thrones, but <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian</hi> Prelates? Prelates have trampled Diadem and Scepter under their feet, as hiſtories teach us.</p>
            <p>4 <hi>Doe they not (Puritans) magiſterially determine, that Kings are not of Gods creation by Authoritative Commiſſion; but only by permiſſion, extorted by importunity, and way given, that they may be a ſcourge to a ſinfull people? Anſ.</hi> Any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean ſpirit from Hell, could not ſpeak a blacker lye, we hold that the <hi>King,</hi> by office, is the <hi>Churches nurſe father,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:119219:5"/>
a ſacred Ordinance, the deputed power of <hi>God;</hi> but by <hi>P. P. his way,</hi> all inferior Judges, and Gods Deputies on earth, who are alſo our fathers in the fifth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſtile, are to be obeyed by no Divine law; the <hi>King</hi> miſled by <hi>P. Prelates,</hi> ſhall forbid to obey them, who is, in right-down truth, a mortall civill <hi>Pope,</hi> may looſe and liberate ſubjects from the tye of a Divine law.</p>
            <p>5 His inveying againſt ruling Elders, and the rooting out of Antichriſtian Prelacie, without any word of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on the contrary, I paſſe as the extravagancy of a male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, becauſe he is deſervedly excommunicated for <hi>Perjury, Popery, Socinianiſme, Tyranny</hi> over mens conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and invading places of civill dignity, and deſerting his calling, and the camp of <hi>Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6 <hi>None were of old anoynted, but Kings, Prieſts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, who then more obliged, to maintain the Lords Anoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then Prieſts and Prophets? The Church hath never more beauty and plenty under any government, then Monarchy, which is moſt countenanced by God, and magnified by Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Paſtors are to maintain the rights of people, and a true Church, no leſſe then the right of <hi>Kings;</hi> but Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the Court Paraſites, and creatures of the <hi>King,</hi> that are born for the Glory of their <hi>King,</hi> can do no leſſe then profeſſe this in words, yet it is true, that <hi>Tacitus</hi> writeth of ſuch, <hi>Hiſt. l. 1. Libentius cum fortuna principis, quam cum principe loquuntur:</hi> and it is true, that the <hi>Church</hi> hath had plenty under <hi>Kings,</hi> not ſo much, becauſe they were <hi>Kings,</hi> as becauſe they were godly and zealous: except the <hi>P. P.</hi> ſay, That the oppreſſing <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Iſraell</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> and the bloody horns that made war with the Lamb, are not Kings. In the reſt of the Epiſtle, he extols the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques</hi> of <hi>Ormond</hi> with baſe flattery, from his Loyalty to the <hi>King,</hi> and his more then <hi>Admirable prudence in the Treaty of Ceſſation with the Rebells;</hi> a woe is due to this falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<pb facs="tcp:119219:5"/>
               <hi>who calleth Darkneſſe Light,</hi> for the former was abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, and perfidious Apoſtacy from the Lords cauſe, and people of God, whom he once defended, and the Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation was a ſelling of the blood of many hundred thouſand proteſtants, Men, Women, and ſucking Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>This curſed P. hath written of late a Treatiſe againſt<note place="margin">A refutation of the P. P.

               </note> the Presbyteriall government of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in which there is a bundle of lyes, helliſh calumnies, and groſſe errors.</p>
            <p>The firſt lye is, that we have Lay-Elders, whereas, they are ſuch as rule, <hi>But labour not in the word and doctrine, 1 Tim. 5. 7. pag.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>2. The ſecond lye, that <hi>Deacons</hi> who only attend Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, are joynt Rulers with Paſtors, <hi>pag.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>3. That we never, or little uſe the leſſer excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that is, debarring from the Lords Supper. <hi>Pag.</hi> 4.</p>

            <p>5 A calumnie it is to ſay, That ruling Elders are of equall authority to Preach the Word, as Paſtors, <hi>Pag.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>6. That Lay-men are members of Presbyteries or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall<note place="margin">6.</note> Aſſemblies; <hi>Buchanan,</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Melvin,</hi> were Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of Divinity: and could have taught ſuch an Aſſe as <hi>Jo.

            <p>10. <hi>That King James ſaid, a Scottiſh Presbytery, and a</hi>

            <p>11. <hi>That the presbytery out of pride refuſed to anſwer King</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 11.</note> 
               <hi>James his Honourable meſſengers,</hi> is a lye, they could not in buſineſſe of high concernment, return a preſent anſwer to a Prince, ſeeking ſtill to aboliſh Presbyteries.</p>
            <p>12. Its a lye, <hi>that all ſins, even all civil buſineſſe, come under the cognizance of the Church,</hi> for only ſins, as publikely ſcandalous, fall under their power, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15, 16, 17. &amp;c. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 11. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 20. It is a calumnie that they ſearch out ſecret crimes, or that ever they diſgraced the innocent, or devided families, where there be fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant ſcandals, and pregnant ſuſpitions; of ſcandalous crimes, they ſearch out theſe, as the inceſt of <hi>Spotſwood, P.

            <p>19. The leading men, that covered the ſins of the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man and ſo loſed his ſoul, were Epiſcopall men: and though ſome of them were <hi>presbyterians,</hi> the faults of men cannot prejudice the truth of <hi>God;</hi> but the Prelates al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes<note place="margin">Pa. 17, 18.</note> cry out againſt the rigor of Presbyteries, in cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
<pb facs="tcp:119219:7"/>
ſcandals, becauſe they themſelves do ill, they hate the light; now here the Prelate condemneth them of remiſſeneſſe in Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>20. Satan, a lier from the beginning, ſaith, The <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 18.</note> 
               <hi>was a ſeminary and nurſery of fiends, and contentions, &amp; bloods:</hi> becauſe they excommunicated murtherers againſt <hi>King James</hi> his will: which is all one as to ſay. Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying <hi>is a nurſe of bloods,</hi> becauſe the Prophets cryed out againſt <hi>King Achab,</hi> and the murtherers of innocent <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both:</hi> the men of <hi>God</hi> muſt be either on the one ſide, or the other, or then preach againſt reciprocation of injuries.</p>
            <p>21. It is falſe, that <hi>Presbyteries uſurp both ſwords:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cenſure ſins, which the civill Magiſtrate ſhould cenſure and puniſh. <hi>Elias</hi> might be ſaid then to mix himſelfe with the civill buſineſſe of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> becauſe he prophecied againſt Idolators killing of the Lords Prophets, which crime the civill Magiſtrate was to puniſh. But the truth is, the Aſſembly of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> 1637. condemned the Prelates, becauſe they being Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, would be alſo Lords of <hi>Parliament, of Seſſion, of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Counſell, of Exchequer,</hi> Judges, Barons, and in their lawleſſe High Commiſſion, would Fine, Impriſon, and uſe the ſword.</p>
            <p>22. It is his ignorance, that he ſaith, A provinciall ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod<note place="margin">Pag. 19.</note> is an <hi>aſſociate body choſen out of all judiciall Presbyteries;</hi> for all Paſtors, and Doctors, without delegation, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their place and office, repaire to the Provinciall Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, and without any choice at all, conſult and voice there.<note place="margin">Pag. 22.</note>
            </p>
            <p>23. It is a lye, <hi>That ſome Leading men rule all here;</hi> indeed Epiſcopall men made factions to rent the Synods: and though men abuſe their power to factions, this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove that Presbyteries are inconſiſtent with <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie;</hi> for then the Prelate, the <hi>Monarch</hi> of his Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian

            <p>24. The prime men, as <hi>Mr. R. Bruce</hi> the faithfull ſervant of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was honoured and attended by all, becauſe of his Suffering, Zeal, Holineſſe, his fruitfull Miniſtery in gaining many thouſand ſouls to <hi>Chriſt:</hi> So, though <hi>King James</hi> caſt him off, and did ſwear, By <hi>Gods</hi> name he intended to be <hi>King,</hi> (the Prelate maketh Blaſphemy a vertue in the <hi>King</hi>) yet <hi>King James</hi> ſware he could not find an honeſt Miniſter in <hi>Scotland</hi> to be a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and therefore he was neceſſitated to promote falſe knaves; but he ſaid ſometimes, and wrote it under his hand, that <hi>Mr. R. Bruce</hi> was worthy of the half of his kingdom: but will this prove Presbyteries incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Monarchies? I ſhould rather think, that Knave <hi>Biſhops,</hi> by <hi>King James</hi> his judgement, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with <hi>Monarchies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>25. His lyes of <hi>Mr. R. Bruce,</hi> excerpted out of the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Manuſcript of Apoſtat <hi>Spotſwood,</hi> in that he would not but preach againſt the Kings recalling from exile ſome Bloody Popiſh Lords, to undo all, are nothing comparable to the Inceſts, Adulteries, Blaſphemies,<note place="margin">P. 22, 23, 24.</note> Perjuries, Sabbath-breaches, Drunkenneſſe, Propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, &amp;c. committed by Prelates before the Sun.</p>

            <p>27. They ought to have no negative vote, to impede the concluſions of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his ſervants.</p>
            <p>28. It is a lye, that the <hi>King</hi> hath no power to appoint time and place for the Generall Aſſembly; but his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is not privative to deſtroy the free Courts of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but accumulative to ayd and aſſiſt them.</p>
            <p>29. It is a lye, <hi>That our generall Aſſembly may repeal

Laws, command and expect performance of the King, or then excommunicate, ſubject to them, force &amp; compell King, Judges, and all, to ſubmit to them.</hi> They may not force the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the pooreſt begger, nor is any Aſſembly infallible, nor can it lay bounds upon ſouls of Iudges, which they are to obey with blind obedience, their power is miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, ſubordinate to <hi>Chriſts</hi> Law; and what civill Laws Parliaments make againſt Gods word, they may Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatively declare them to be unlawfull; as though the Emperour, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. had commanded <hi>Fornication and eating of blood,</hi> might not the Aſſembly forbid theſe in the Synod? I conceive the Prelates, if they had power, would repeal the Act of Parliament made, <hi>An.</hi> 1641. in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by his Majeſtie perſonally preſent, and the three Eſtates concerning the anulling of theſe Acts of Parliament, and Laws, which eſtabliſhed <hi>Biſhops in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.

            <p>31. Doctors both in Accademies, and in Pariſhes, we<note place="margin">Pag. 31.</note> deſire, and our Book of Diſcipline holdeth forth ſuch.</p>
            <p>32. They hold (I beleeve with warrant of Gods word) if the King refuſe to reform Religion, the inferior Iudges and Aſſembly of Godly Paſtors, and other Church Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers may reform; if the <hi>King</hi> will not kiſſe the Sun, and<note place="margin">Pag. 33, 34, 35.</note> do his duty in purging the Houſe of the Lord, may not <hi>Eliah</hi> and the people do their duty, and caſt out <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts? Reformation of Religion is a perſonall act that

belongeth to all, even to any one private perſon accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his place.</p>
            <p>33. They may ſwear a Covenant without the <hi>King,</hi> if he refuſe; and Build the Lords Houſe, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 9. themſelves: and relieve and defend one another, when they are oppreſſed. For my acts and duties of defending my ſelf and the oppreſſed, do not tye my conſcience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally, ſo the King conſent, but abſolutely, as all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Law of nature doe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 22. 3. <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 11. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 58. 6. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1. 17.</p>
            <p>34. The P. P. condemneth our Reformation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was done againſt the will of our Popiſh <hi>Queen.</hi> This ſheweth what eſtimation he hath of Popery, and how he abhorreth Proteſtant Religion.</p>
            <p>35. They depoſed the Queen for Her Tyranny, but Crowned her Son; all this is vindicated in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>36. The killing of the monſtrous and prodigious wicked <hi>Cardinall</hi> in the <hi>Caſtle of St. Andrews,</hi> and the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence done to the Prelates, who againſt all Law of <hi>God</hi> and man obtruded a Maſſe ſervice upon their own private motion, in <hi>Edinbrough An.</hi> 1637. can conclude nothing againſt Presbyteriall Government, except our Doctrine commend theſe acts as lawfull.</p>
            <p>37. What was preached by the ſervant of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whom <hi>p.</hi> 46. he calleth the <hi>Scottiſh Pope, is Printed,</hi> and the P.

            <p>38. The making away the fat <hi>Abbacies and Biſhopricks,</hi> is a bloody Hereſie to the earthly minded Prelate: the Confeſſion of Faith commended, by all the Proteſtant <hi>Churches,</hi> as a ſtrong bar againſt Popety, and the book of Diſcipline, in which the ſervants of God laboured

            <p>39. And was it a hereſie that <hi>M. Melvin</hi> taught, that Presbyter and Biſhop are one function in Scripture? and that Abbots and Priors were not in Gods book? <hi>dic ubi legis:</hi> and is this a proof of inconſiſtency of <hi>Presbyteries</hi> with a <hi>Monarchie?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>40 It is a hereſie to the P.

            <p>44. They excommunicate not for light faults and trifles as the Lyar ſaith: our Diſcipline ſaith the contrary.</p>
            <p>45. This Aſſembly never took on them to choſe the <hi>Kings</hi> Counſellours, but theſe who were in authority took <hi>K.

the Law of God, 2 Chron. 19. 6. then the King, Deut. 17. v. 15. And in an obligation morall of judging righteouſly, the conſcience of the Monarch, and the conſcience of the <hi>inferiour Iudges</hi> are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with an immediate ſubjection under the King of Kings, for there is here a co-ordination of conſciences, and no ſubordination, for it is not in the power of the inferiour Iudge to judge, <hi>Quoad ſpecifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem,</hi> as the King commandeth him, becauſe the judgement is neither the Kings, nor any mortall mans, but the Lords, 2 Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles 19. 6, 7.</p>

               <p>But there is no title on earth now to tye crownes to families, to perſons, but onely the ſuffrages of the people: for, 1.

The Lords giving of Regall parts is ſomewhat; but I hope <hi>Royalliſts</hi> will not deny but a child young in yeares and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may be a lawfull King. 3. Mr. <hi>Maxwell</hi> his appointing of the Kingly office, doth no more make one man a lawfull <hi>King,</hi> then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: for this were a wide conſequence.

If he meane that theſe men, <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> were created Kings by the onely extraordinary revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>God</hi> from Heaven, it is a lye; for beſide the Propheticall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynting of them, they were made <hi>Kings</hi> by the people, as the word ſaith expreſly; except we ſay that <hi>David</hi> ſinned in not ſetting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe downe on the Throne, when <hi>Samuel</hi> anoynted him firſt <hi>King;</hi> and ſo he ſhould have made away his Maſter <hi>King Saul</hi> out of the world; and there were not a few called to the Throne, by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but many, yea all the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Iudah.</hi> 4. The <hi>Prelate</hi> contendeth that a King is deſigned to his royall dignity, <hi>immediatly from God, without an extraordinary revelation from Heaven,</hi> as the man is <hi>deſigned to be a Paſtor by men; and yet the power of Preaching is immediatly from God, &amp;c.</hi> but he proveth nothing, except he prove that all Paſtors are called to be Paſtors <hi>immediatly;</hi> and that God calleth and deſigneth to the Throne ſuch a perſon immediatly, as he hath immediatly inſtituted by the power of Preaching, and the Apoſtleſhip, and hath immediatly infuſed the ſoule in the body, by an act of Creation; and we cannot conceive how <hi>God</hi> in our daies, when there are no extraordinary revelations, doth <hi>immediatly</hi> create this man a King, and immediatly tie the crown to this family rather then to this; this he doth by the people now, without any <hi>Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Vnction;</hi> and by this <hi>medium,</hi> to wit, by the free choice of the people. He needeth not bring the example of <hi>Matthias</hi> more than of any ordinary Paſtor, and yet an ordinary Paſtor is not
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:119219:31"/>
immediatly called of God, becauſe the Office of an ordinary Paſtor is from God <hi>immediatly,</hi> and alſo the man is made Paſtor by the Church.</p>

A baptized man obtaineth remisſion and regeneration, yet aſperſion of water cannot produce theſe excellent effects. A <hi>King</hi> giveth power to a favourite to make a Lord or a Baron, yet who is ſo ſtupid as to averre the honour of a Lord commeth immediatly from the favourite, and not from the King. 3. When a man hath by ſome ordinary humane right, a full and juſt right, and the approbation and confirmation of this right is immediatly from God.</p>
               <p>The firſt way, Soveraignty is not from God. The ſecond way, Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty is conferred on Kings immediatly, though ſome created act of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, ſucceſion, conqueſts intervene, the interpoſed act containeth not in it power to conferre Soveraignty; as in Baptiſme, Regeneration, if there be nothing repugnant in the ſuſcipient, is conferred, not by water, but immediatly by God. In ſacred Orders deſignation is from men, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to ſupernatur all acts from God: election, ſuccesſion, conqueſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely and improperly conſtitute a King. To ſay in the third ſence that ſoveraignty is immediatly from God, by approbation or confirmation onely, is againſt Scripture, Prov. 8. 15. Pſa. 82. 8. Ioh. 19. then the people ſay; you are Gods, your power is from below. And <hi>Pauls,</hi> (ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God) is (approved and confirmed onely of God) the power of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation, or application of the perſon to royalty is from man; the power of conferring royall power, or of applying the perſon to royall power is from God.

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. <hi>Apoſtles</hi> both according to their Office, and the deſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their perſon to the Office were immediatly and onely from <hi>God,</hi> without any act of the people, and therefore are badly cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled with the royall power of <hi>David and King Saul,</hi> who were not formally made Kings, but by the people at <hi>Mizpeh and Hebron,</hi> 2. The ſecond way God giveth Royall Power by moving the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples hearts to confer royall power, and this is virtually in the people, formally from God. Water hath no influence to produce grace, Gods inſtitution and promiſe doth it; except you dream with your

                  <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> of <hi>opus operatum,</hi> that water ſprinkled, by the doing of the deed conferreth grace, <hi>niſi ponatur obex,</hi> what can the child doe, or one child more then another baptized child, to hinder the flux of remiſſion of ſins, if you meane not that Baptiſme worketh as Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick on a ſick man, except ſtrength of humours hinder? and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this compariſon is not alike. The people cannot produce ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble an effect as royalty, a beame of God. True, formally they cannot, but <hi>virtually</hi> it is in a ſociety of reaſonable men, in whom are left beames of authoritative Majeſty, which by a divine inſtitution they can give, Deut. 17. 14. to this man, to <hi>David,</hi> not to <hi>Eliab;</hi> and I could well ſay the Favorite made the Lord, and placed honour in the man whom he made Lord, by a borrowed power from his Prince; and yet the honour of a Lord is principally from the King. 3. It is true, theelection of the people conteineth not formally Royall dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, but the Word ſaith, <hi>they made Saul, they made David King:</hi> ſo virtually election muſt conteine it. <hi>Samuels</hi> oyle maketh not <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> King, he is a ſubject after he is anointed; the peoples election at <hi>Hebron</hi> maketh him <hi>King;</hi> 2. differenceth him from his brethren; 3. putteth him in Royall ſtate; yet <hi>God</hi> is the principall agent.

The third ſenſe is the Prelates dreame, not a <hi>Tenet</hi> of ours; we never ſaid

that ſoveraigntie in the King is <hi>immediately</hi> from <hi>God</hi> by approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or <hi>confirmation</hi> only, as if the people firſt made the King, and <hi>God</hi> did only by a poſterior and latter act ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to the deed done, and ſubſcribe, as Recorder, to what the people doth: ſo the people ſhould deale kingdomes and crownes at their pleaſure, and <hi>God</hi> behoved to ratifie and make good their fact. When <hi>God</hi> doth apply the perſon to royall power, what? is this a different action from the peoples applying the perſon to royall dignitie? It is not i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable: but the people by creating a <hi>king,</hi> applyeth the perſon to <hi>royall dignitie;</hi> and <hi>God</hi> by the peoples act of conſtituting the man <hi>king,</hi> doth by the mediation of this act convey royall authoritie to the man, as the <hi>Church</hi> by ſending a man, and ordaining him to bee a Paſtor, doth not by that, as Gods inſtruments, infuſe ſupernaturall powers of preaching: theſe powers ſupernaturall may be, and often are in him before he be in orders; and ſometimes God infuſeth a ſupernaturall power of government in a man, when he is not yet a <hi>king, as the Lord turned Saul into another man,</hi> 1 Sam. 10. 5. 6. neither at that point of time when <hi>Samuel</hi> anointed him, but after that, v. 5. <hi>After that thou ſhalt come to the hill of God, 6. the ſpirit of the Lord ſhall come upon thee, and thou ſhalt prophecie with them, and ſhalt be turned into another man.</hi> Nor yet at that time when he is formally made <hi>King</hi> by the people; for <hi>Saul</hi> was not <hi>King</hi> formally, becauſe of <hi>Samuels</hi> anointing, nor yet was he King becauſe another ſpirit was infuſed into him, v. 5, 6. for he was yet a privat man, till the States of <hi>Iſrael</hi> choſe him <hi>King at Mizpeh.</hi> And the word of God uſeth words of action to expreſſe the peoples power, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 9. 6.

This peremptorie precept diſchargeth the people, all, and every one, diffuſively, repreſentatively, or in any imaginable capacity to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the appointing of a King, but to leave it entirely and totally to God Almighty.</p>

part of your diſtinction is, that <hi>God</hi> not by himſelf, but by his Prelates, appointed the whole Romiſh Rites, as accidentalls of pietie. This is the Ieſuites doctrine. 2. This place is ſo far from proving the King to be independent, and that it totally is Gods to appoint a King, that it expreſly giveth the people power to appoint a King: for the ſetting of a King over themſelves, ſuch a one, and not ſuch a one, makes the people to appoint the <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> to be leſſe and dependent on the people, ſeeing God intendeth the King for the peoples good, and not the people for the <hi>Kings</hi> good.

If <hi>God</hi> give to <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> the ſame ſtill of the ſervant of God, given to <hi>David,</hi> Pſ. 18. 1. &amp; 116. 16. and to <hi>Moſes,</hi> Ioſ. 1, 2. all <hi>Kings,</hi> becauſe <hi>Kings</hi> are men accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods heart. Why is not royalty then founded on grace? <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> was not otherwiſe his ſervant, then he was the hammer of the earth, and a tyrannous conquerour of the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and all the Heathen Kings are called Kings. But how came they to their Thrones for the moſt part? as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah?</hi> but God anointed them not by his Prophets; they came to their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes by the peoples election, or by blood and rapine; the latter way is no ground to you to deny <hi>Athaliah</hi> to be a lawfull Princeſſe, ſhe and <hi>Abimelech</hi> were lawfull Princes, and their ſoveraignty as immediatly and independently from God, as the ſoveraignty of many heathen Kings. See then how juſtly <hi>Athaliah</hi> was killed as a bloody uſurper of the throne; &amp; this would licence your brethren the Ieſuites to ſtab heathen Kings, whom you will have as well Kings as the Lords anointed, though <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> &amp; many of them made
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:119219:35"/>
their way to the Throne, againſt all Law of God and man, through a bloudy patent. 4. <hi>Cyrus</hi> is <hi>Gods anointed</hi> and his <hi>Shepheard</hi> too, <hi>ergo</hi> his Arbitrary government is a ſoveraignty immediatly depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on God, and above all Law; it is a wicked conſequence. 5. <hi>God</hi> named him neare a hundreth yeare ere he was borne, God named and deſigned <hi>Judas</hi> very individually, and named the Aſſe that Chriſt ſhould ride on to Ieruſalem, Zach. 9. 9. ſome moe hundred yeares then one. What, will the Prelate make them independent <hi>Kings</hi> for that? 6. God giveth Kingdomes to whom he will. What then? this will prove Kingdomes to be as independent and immediatly from <hi>God,</hi> as Kings are; for as <hi>God</hi> giveth Kings to Kingdomes, ſo he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Kingdomes to Kings, and no doubt he giveth Kingdoms to whom he will; ſo he giveth <hi>Prophets, Apoſtles, Paſtors</hi> to whom he will; and he giveth tyrannous conqueſts to whom he will: and it is <hi>Nebuchadnezer,</hi> to whom <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeaketh that, from the Lord, and he had no juſt title to many Kingdomes, eſpecially to the Kingdome of <hi>Iudah,</hi> which yet <hi>God the King of Kings</hi> gave to him, becauſe it was his good pleaſure; and if <hi>God</hi> had not commanded them by the mouth of his Prophet <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> might they not have riſen, and with the ſword have vindicated themſelves and their own liberty, no leſſe then they lawfully by the ſword vindicated themſelves from under <hi>Moab,</hi> Iudges 3. from under <hi>Iabin, Iaakin</hi> King of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> who twenty yeares mightily <hi>oppreſſed the children of Iſrael,</hi> Iudges. 4.? now this <hi>P.

                  <hi>Solomon</hi> as <hi>King,</hi> and yet they made him not <hi>King,</hi> as the <hi>Princes of Iſraell</hi> did. 2. Reverence and obedience of the people is relative to the <hi>Kings</hi> lawes, but the peoples making of a <hi>King</hi> is not relative to the laws of a King; for then he ſhould be a King giving laws, and commanding the people, as King, before the people make him King. 3.

From a moſt ſpeciall and eminent act of Gods providence, Chriſt came into the world, and tooke on him our nature: <hi>ergo,</hi> he came not of <hi>Davids</hi> loynes. It is a vaine conſequence. There could not be a more eminent act then this, <hi>Pſal. 40.

It is tyrannicall and dominee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Logick. Many things are aſcribed to <hi>God</hi> only, by reaſon of a ſpeciall and admirable act of providence: as the ſaving of the world by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the giving of <hi>Canaan</hi> to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the bringing his people out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and from <hi>Chaldea,</hi> the ſending of the Goſpel to both Iew &amp; Gentile, &amp;c.

               <p>P. Prelate. 1. <hi>To whom can it be more proper to give the rule over men, then to him who is the onely King truely and properly of the whole world? 2. God is the immediate Author of all rule and power that is amongſt all his creatures, above or below. 3. Man before the fall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived dominion, and empire over all the creatures below immediatly, as</hi> Gen. 1. 28. Gen. 9. 2. ergo <hi>we cannot deny that the moſt noble go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment (to wit Monarchy) muſt be immediatly from God, without any Contract or compact of men. Anſ.</hi> The firſt reaſon concludeth not what is in queſtion; for <hi>God</hi> only giveth rule and power to one man over another; <hi>ergo</hi> he giveth it <hi>immediatly,</hi> it followeth not. 2. It ſhall as well prove that God doth <hi>immediatly</hi> conſtitute all Iudges, and therefore it ſhall be unlawfull for a city to appoint a Major, or a ſhire a Iuſtice of peace. 3. The ſecond argument is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſequent alſo, becauſe God in creation is the immediat Author of<note place="margin">The excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Kings maketh them not of Gods only conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> all things, and therefore without conſent of the creatures, or any act of the creature, created an Angell a nobler creature then man, and a man then a woman, and men above beaſts; becauſe thoſe that are not, can exerciſe no act at all. But it followeth not; <hi>ergo</hi> all the workes of providence, ſuch as is the government of Kingdomes are done immediatly by God, for in the workes of providence, for the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:119219:41"/>
moſt part in ordinary, God worketh by meanes; it is then as good a conſequence as this. God immediatly created man, <hi>ergo</hi> he kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth his life immediatly alſo without foode and ſleepe. God <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly</hi> created the Sunne, <hi>ergo</hi> God immediatly without the mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sunne giveth light to the world. The making of a King is an act of reaſon, and God hath given a man reaſon to rule him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; and therefore hath given to a ſociety an inſtinct of reaſon, to appoint a governour over themſelves, but no act of reaſon goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore man be created; <hi>ergo</hi> it is not in his power whether he be crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a creature of greater power then a beaſt or no. 4. God by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion gave power to a man over the creatures, and ſo immediatly; but I hope a man cannot ſay, God by creation hath made a man King over men. 5. The Excellency of <hi>Monarchy</hi> (if it be excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then any other government, of which hereafter) is no ground why it ſhould be <hi>immediatly</hi> from God, as well as mans dominion over the creature; for then the worke of mans redemption being more excellent then the ray<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The execution of the Kingly power is from God, for the King is the Servant, Angell, Legat, Miniſter of God, Rom. 13. 6, 7. God properly and primarily is King, and King of Kings and Lord of Lords, 1. Tim. 6. 15. Rev. 1. 5. 21. 27. 29. 20. all Kings related to him, are Kings equivocally, and in reſemblance, and he the only King.</hi> Anſ. That which is in queſtion is never concluded; to wit, that <hi>the King is both immediatly conſtituted and deſigned King, by God onely, and not by the mediation of the people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> for when God reconcileth and ſaveth men by Paſtors, he ſaveth them by the intervening action of men, ſo he ſcourgeth his people by men, as by his ſword, Pſal. 17. 14. <hi>and hand, ſtaffe, and rod, Eſay 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. his hammer.</hi> Doth it follow that God onely doth <hi>immediatly</hi>

ſcourge his people, and that wicked men have no more hand and action in ſcourging his people, then the Prelate ſaith the people have an hand in making a <hi>King?</hi> and that is no hand at all, by the Prelates way.</p>
               <p>2. We may borrow the Prelates argument: inferiour Iudges exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the judgement of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and not the judgement of the <hi>King; ergo,</hi> by the Prelates argument, God doth only by immediate power execute judgement in them, and the inferiour Iudges are not <hi>Gods</hi> miniſters executing the judgement of the <hi>Lord.</hi> But the Concluſion is againſt all truth, and ſo muſt the Prelates argument be. And that inferiour Iudges are the immediate ſubſtitutes and deputies of God, is hence proved, and ſhall be hereafter made good, if God will. 3. God is properly <hi>King of Kings,</hi> ſo is God properly <hi>cauſa cauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> the cauſe of cauſes, <hi>the life of lifes, the joy of joyes.</hi> What, ſhall it then follow, that he worketh nothing in the creatures by their mediation, as cauſes? Becauſe God is light of lights, doth he not enlighten the earth and aire by the mediation of the Sun? then God communicateth not life mediately by generation, he cauſeth not his Saints to rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and glorious, by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening mediation of the Word. Theſe are vaine conſequences. <hi>Soueraignty,</hi> and all power and virtue is in God infinitely: And what vertue and power of action is in the creatures, as they are compared with God, are in the creatures equivocally and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in opinion, rather then really. Hence it muſt follow, 1. that ſecond cauſes worke none at all, no more then the people hath a hand or action in making the <hi>King,</hi> and that is no hand at all, as the Prelate ſaith, And God only and immediately worketh all workes in the creatures, becauſe both the power of working and actuall working commeth from God, and the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in all their working, are Gods inſtruments: and if the Prelate argue ſo frequently from power given of God, to prove that actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reigning is from God immediately, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 18. The <hi>Lord giveth the power, to get wealth:</hi> will it follow that <hi>Iſrael</hi> getteth no riches at all, or that God doth not mediately by them and their in duſtrie get them? I thinke not.</p>
               <p>P. Prelate. 6. <hi>To whom can it be due to give the Kingly office, but to him only who is able to give the indument and abilitie for the office? now God only and immediately giveth abilitie to be a King, as the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall anointing proveth,</hi> Joſh. 3. 10. <hi>Othniel is the firſt Judge after Joſhua; and it is ſaid, And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:119219:42"/>
and he judged Iſrael; the like is ſaid of</hi> Saul <hi>and</hi> David. <hi>Anſ.</hi> God gave royall indowments <hi>immediatly, ergo</hi> he immediatly now ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the King. It followeth not, for the ſpecies of government is not that which formally conſtituteth a King, for then <hi>Nero, Caligu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, Iulian</hi> ſhould not have been Kings, and thoſe who come to the Crowne by conqueſt and blood, are eſſentially Kings, as the <hi>Prelate</hi> ſaith; but be all theſe <hi>Othniels, upon whom the ſpirit of the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth?</hi> then they are not eſſentially <hi>Kings</hi> who are babes and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and fooliſh and deſtitute of the royall endowments, but it is one thing to have a royall gift, and another thing to be formally cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Kingdome, <hi>David</hi> had royall gifts after <hi>Samuel</hi> anoynted him, but if you make him King, before <hi>Sauls</hi> death, <hi>Saul</hi> was both a traytor all the time that he perſecuted <hi>David,</hi> and ſo no King, and alſo King and Gods anoynted, as <hi>David</hi> acknowledgeth him; and therefore that ſpirit that came on <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> maketh nothing againſt the peoples election of a King, as the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> is given to Paſtors under the new Teſtament, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> promiſed; but it will not follow that the deſignation of the man who is to be Paſtor, ſhould not be from the <hi>Church</hi> and from men, as the <hi>Prelate</hi> denyeth that either the conſtitution or deſignation of the King is from the people, but from <hi>God</hi> onely. 2. I beleeve the infuſion of the ſpirit of God upon the Iudges will not prove that Kings are now both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted and deſigned of <hi>God ſolely, onely,</hi> and <hi>immediatly;</hi> for the Iudges were indeed immediatly and for the moſt part extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily raiſed up of God, and God indeed in the time of the <hi>Iewes</hi> was the King of Iſrael in another manner then he was the <hi>King</hi> of all the nations, and is the <hi>King</hi> of Chriſtian Realmes now, and therefore the peoples deſpiſing of <hi>Samuel,</hi> was a refuſing that <hi>God</hi> ſhould reigne over them, becauſe God in the Iudges revealed himſelfe even in matters of Policy, as what ſhould be done to the man that gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſticks on the Sabbath day, and the like, as he doth not now to Kings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P. Prelate.</hi> Soveraigntie is a ray of divine glory and majeſtie: but this cannot be found in people, whether you conſider them joyntly, or ſingly; if you conſider them ſingly, it cannot be in every individuall man; for Sectaries ſay, That all are born equall with a like freedom: and if it be not in the people ſingly, it cannot be in them joyntly; for all the contribution in this compact and contract which they fancie to be humane compoſition, and voluntary conſtitution, is onely, by a ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the native right that every one had in himſelf; from whence
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:119219:43"/>
then can this majeſtie and authoritie be derived? Again, where the obligation amongſt equals is by contract and compact, violation of the faith, plighted in the contract, cannot in proper termes, be called diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, or contempt of authoritie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is no more but a receding from, and a violation of that which was promiſed, as it may be in States or Counties confederate. Nature, reaſon, conſcience, ſcripture, teach, That diſobedience to Soveraign power is not onely a violation of Truth, breach of Covenant, but alſo high diſobedience and contempt, as is clear, <hi>1 Sam. 10. 26.</hi> So when <hi>Saul, Chap. 11.</hi> ſent a yoak of Oxen, hewed in pieces, to all the Tribes, the fear of the Lord fell on the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and they came out with one conſent, <hi>1 Sam. 11. 17.</hi> ſo <hi>Job 11. 18.</hi> He looſeth the bonds of Kings, that is, he looſeth their authoritie, and bringeth them in contempt; and he girdeth there loyns with a girdle, that is, he ſtrengthneth their authoritie, and maketh the people to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence them.

It is falſe, that it is not virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the people: for there be two things in the Iudge, either infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior or ſupream (for the argument holdeth in the majeſtie of a Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, as we ſhall hear) 1. The gift or grace of Governing (the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian Prelate</hi> will offend at this.) 2. The Authority of governing: 1. The gift is ſupernaturall, and is not in man naturally, and ſo not in the King; for he is <hi>phyſically</hi> but a mortall man, and this is a gift received; for <hi>Salomon</hi> asked it by prayer from <hi>God.</hi> There is a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie paſſive in all individuall men for it: as for the officiall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie it ſelf, it is virtually in all, in whom any of gods image is remaining, ſince the fall, as is clear; as may be gathered from, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 28. yea, the Father, the Maſter, the Judge, have it by Gods inſtitution in ſome meaſure, over ſon, ſervant, and ſubject, though it be more in the ſupreme Ruler<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for our purpoſe, it is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that authoritative majeſtie ſhould be in all. (What is in the Father and Husband, I hope to clear) I mean, it needeth not to be formally in all, and ſo all are born alike and equall: But he who is a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> a <hi>Socinian,</hi> an <hi>Arminian,</hi> and therefore delivered to Satan by his mother Church, muſt be the <hi>Sectarie,</hi> for we are where this <hi>Prelate</hi> left us, maintainers of the Proteſtant Religion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Confeſſion of Faith, and Nationall Covenant of <hi>Scotland,</hi> when this <hi>Demas</hi> forſook us, and embraced the World. 2.

theſe men combined in a Citie, or Societie, have not power in a joynt Politicall body, to choſe Inferiour or <hi>Ariſtocraticall</hi> Rulers. 3. The <hi>P.

I anſwer. Very well. For the ſurrender is ſo voluntary, that it is alſo naturall, and founded on the Law of nature, That men muſt have Governours, either many, or one ſupreme Ruler: And it is volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and dependeth on a poſitive inſtitution of God, Whether the Government be by one ſupreme Ruler, as in a <hi>Monarchie,</hi> or in many, as in an <hi>Ariſtocracie,</hi> according as the neceſſitie and temper of the Common-wealth do moſt require. This Conſtitution is ſo voluntary, as it hath below it, the Law of nature for its generall foundation; and above it, the ſupervenient inſtitution of God, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining, That there ſhould be ſuch Magiſtrates, both Kings, and other Iudges, becauſe without ſuch, all humane ſocieties ſhould be diſſolved. 4. Individuall perſons in creating a Magiſtrate, doth<note place="margin">A Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty doth not ſurrender their right and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to their Rulers, ſo much as their power active to do, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to ſuffer unjuſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</note> not properly ſurrender their right, which can be called a right; for they do but ſurrender their power of doing violence to theſe of their fellows in that ſame Communitie; ſo as they ſhall not now have Morall power to do injuries without puniſhment; and this is not right or libertie properly, but ſervitude: for a power to do violence and injuries, is not liberty, but ſervitude and bondage.

He ſaith, <hi>Violation of faith plighted in a contract a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt equals, cannot be called diſobedience, but diſobedience to the authoritie of the Soveraign is not onely breach of Covenant; but high diſobedience and contempt.</hi> But violation of faith amongſt equals, as equals, is not properly diſobedience; for diſobedience is betwixt a ſuperiour and an inferiour: but violation of faith amongſt equals, when they make one of their equals their Iudge and Ruler, is not onely violation of truth, but alſo diſobedience. All <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> while he is a private man ſeeking his fathers Aſſes, are equals by Covenant obliged one to another; and ſo any injury done by <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> to <hi>Saul</hi> in that caſe, is not diſobedience, but onely violation of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Ergo,</hi> God hath placed authority in Kings, which is not in people: It is true, becauſe God hath transferred the ſcattered authorities that are in all the people, in one Maſſe; and by vertue of his own Ordinance, hath placed them in one man who is King.

a King is ſacred to all men, ſubjects, or not ſubjects; then it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull to make war againſt any forraign King and Prince, for in invading him, or reſiſting him, you reſiſt that divine majeſtie of God, that is in him; then you may not lawfully flee from a tyrant, no more then you may lawfully flie from God. 10. <hi>Scipio</hi> was not a King. <hi>Ergo,</hi> This divine majeſtie is in all Iudges of the earth, in a more or leſſe meaſure. <hi>Ergo,</hi> God onely and <hi>immediately,</hi> may take this ſpark of divine majeſtie from inferiour Iudges: It follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not.

It will puzzle the <hi>pretended Prelate</hi> to deny this, that which the community doth freely, they doe not from ſuch a paſſive capacity, as is <hi>in the firſt matter, in regard of the forme.</hi> 3. It is true that people through corruption of nature are averſe to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to Governours, <hi>for conſcience ſake, and as to the Lord,</hi> becauſe the naturall man remaining in the ſtate of nature can doe nothing that is truely good, but it is falſe that men have no active Morall power to ſubmit to ſuperiours, but only a paſſive capacity to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, he quite contradicteth himſelfe, for he ſaid before, c. 4. pag. 49. that there is an <hi>innate feare and reverence in the hearts of all men naturally, even in Heathen toward their Severaign;</hi> yea as we have a naturall morall active power to love our Parents and ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours (though it be not Evangelically, or legally in <hi>Gods</hi> Court, good) and ſo to obey their commandements, only we are averſe to penall Lawes of ſuperiours; but this proveth no way, that we have only by nature, a paſſive capacity to government; for Heathens have by inſtinct of nature both made Lawes morally good, ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, ſet Kings and Iudges over them; which clearely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth that men have an active power of Government by nature.

4. yea, what difference maketh the Prelate betwixt men and beaſts, for beaſts have a capacity to be governed, even <hi>Lyons</hi> and <hi>Tigers;</hi> but here is the matter, if men have any naturall power of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the <hi>P.

But it is certaine our power to ſubmit to Rulers and Kings as to rectors, and guides and fathers, is naturall, to ſubmit to Tyrants in doing ills of ſinne, is naturall, but in ſuffering ills of puniſhment its not naturall. 5. <hi>No man can give that which he hath not,</hi> is true, but that people have no power to make their Governours, is that which is in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and denyed by us. 6. This argument doth prove that people hath no power to appoint <hi>Ariſtocraticall</hi> Rulers more then Kings, and ſo the <hi>Ariſtocraticall</hi> and <hi>Democraticall</hi> Rulers are all inviolable and ſacred, as the King. 2. by this the people may not reſume their freedome if they turne tyrants and oppreſſors; this the Prelate ſhall deny, for he averreth, p. 96. out of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that the people may without ſin change a corrupt <hi>Democracy</hi> into a <hi>Monarchy.</hi>

But the truth is, the Communitie orderly convee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as it includeth all the Eſtates civill, have hand, and are to act in chooſing their Rulers: I ſee not what priviledge Nobles have above Commons in a Court of Parliament, by Gods law; but as they are Iudges, all are equally Iudges, and all make up one congregation of <hi>Gods.</hi> But the queſtion now is, if all power of governing (the Prelate, to make all the people <hi>Kings,</hi> ſaith, if all <hi>Soveraignty</hi>) be ſo in the people, that they retaine power to guard themſelves againſt Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny?

I am not now unſeaſonably, according to the Prelates order, to diſpute of the power of lawfull defence againſt tyranny; but I lay down this maxime of Divinitie; <hi>Tyranny being a worke of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, is not from God,</hi> becauſe ſinne either habituall or actuall, is not from God, the <hi>power that is, muſt be from God;</hi> the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> as <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> is good, in nature of office, and the intrinſecall end of his office, Rom. 13. 4. <hi>for he is the Miniſter of God for thy good;</hi> and therefore a power ethicall, politick, or morall, to oppreſſe, is not from <hi>God,</hi> and is not a power, but a licentious deviation of a power, and is no more from <hi>God,</hi> but from ſinfull nature, and the old ſerpent, then a licenſe to ſinne: <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Chriſt</hi> giveth pardons of ſinne; but the <hi>Pope,</hi> not <hi>God,</hi> giveth diſpenſations to ſinne. 2. To this adde, If for nature to defend it ſelfe be lawfull, no Communitie, without ſin, hath power to alienate and give away this power: for as no power given to man to murther his brother, is of <hi>God,</hi> ſo no power to ſuffer his brother to be murthered, is of <hi>God;</hi> and no power to ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe (<hi>à fortiori</hi>) far leſſe can be from <hi>God.</hi> Here I ſpeake not of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicall power, for if free will be the creature of <hi>God,</hi> a phyſicall power to acts which in relation to <hi>Gods</hi> law are ſinfull, muſt be from <hi>God.</hi>

I take, there is a large difference betwixt a thing tranſmittable by birth from the father to the ſonne, and a thing not tranſmittable. 3. I conceive, as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is choſen to be a King over a people, ſo a familie or houſe may be choſen, and a Kingdome at firſt chooſing a perſon to be their <hi>King,</hi> may alſo tye themſelves to chooſe the firſt borne of his body: but as they tranſferre their power to the father, 1. for their owne ſafetie and peace, (not if he uſe the power they give him, to their deſtruction) the ſame way they tye themſelves to his firſt borne, as to their <hi>King.</hi> 2. As they choſe the father not as a man, but a man gifted with Royall grace, and a Princely facultie for government; ſo they can but tye themſelves to his firſt borne, as to one graced with a facultie of governing: and if his firſt borne ſhall be borne an idiot and a foole, they are not obliged to make him King; for the obligation to the ſonne can be no greater then the obligation to the father, which firſt obligation is the ground, meaſure and cauſe of all poſterior obligations. If Tutors be appointed to governe ſuch an one, the Tutors have the Royall power, not the Idiot; nor can he governe others, who cannot governe himſelfe. That <hi>Kings</hi> goe not as heritage from the father to the ſonne, I prove; 1. <hi>God,</hi> Deut. 17. could not command them to chooſe ſuch a one for the <hi>King,</hi> and ſuch a one <hi>who ſitting on his throne</hi> ſhall follow the direction of <hi>God</hi> ſpeaking in his word, if birth were that which gave him Gods title and right to the Crowne; for that were as much as ſuch a man ſhould be heire to his fathers inheritance, and the ſonne not heire to his fathers crown, except he were ſuch a man: But <hi>God</hi> in all the Law morall or judiciall, never required that the heire ſhould be thus and thus qualified, elſe he ſhould not be heire: but he requireth that a man, and ſo that a familie ſhould be thus and thus qualified, elſe they ſhould not be <hi>Kings:</hi> and I confirme it thus: The firſt <hi>King</hi> of divine inſtitution muſt be the rule, paterne and meaſure of all the reſt of the Kings, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> maketh the firſt Mariage,

If <hi>Royaliſts</hi> ſay, <hi>God the King of Kings who immediately maketh Kings, may, and doth transferre Kingdomes to whom he will, and when he putteth the ſword in</hi> Nebuchadnezers <hi>hand, to conquer the King and Kingdome of</hi> Iudah, <hi>then</hi> Zedikiah <hi>or his ſonne is not King of Iudah, but</hi> Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezer <hi>is King, and God being above his Law, ſpeaketh in that caſe his Will by conqueſts, as before he ſpake his Will by birth; this is all</hi> can be ſaid. <hi>Anſ.</hi> They anſwer black treaſon in ſaying ſo, for if <hi>Ieremiah</hi> from the <hi>Lord</hi> had not commanded expreſly, that both the <hi>King and Kingdome of Judah</hi> ſhould ſubmit to the <hi>King of</hi>

If birth be Gods regulating Will, that the Heire of the King is in Gods Court a King, no act of the conquerour can anull that Word of God to us, and the people may not lawfully, though they were ten times ſubdued, ſweare homage and allegiance to a conquerour, againſt the due right of birth, which by Royaliſts Doctrine revealeth to us the plaine contradictory Will of God.

according to Scripture nothing regulateth our will, and leadeth the people now that they cannot erre, following Gods rule in making a King, but the free ſuffrages of the States chooſing a man whom they conceive God hath endued with theſe royall gifts required in the <hi>King</hi> whom <hi>God</hi> holdeth forth to them in his Word, Deut. 17. now there be but theſe to regulate the people, or to be a rule to any man to aſcend lawfully (<hi>in foro Dei</hi>) in <hi>Gods</hi> Court to the Throne; 1. <hi>Gods</hi> immediate deſignation of a man by Propheticall and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely<note place="margin">Violent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt cannot regulate the conſciences of people to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour as their lawfull King.</note> inſpired <hi>unction,</hi> as <hi>Samuel</hi> annoynted <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>David;</hi> this we are not to expect now, nor can Royaliſts ſay it. 2. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, ſeeing it is an act of violence, and Gods revenging Juſtice for the ſinnes of a people, cannot give in Gods Court ſuch a juſt title to the Throne, as the people are to ſubmit their conſciences unto, except <hi>God</hi> reveale his regulating will by ſome immediate voice from Heaven, as he commanded <hi>Iudah</hi> to ſubmit to <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezer</hi> as to their <hi>King</hi> by the <hi>mouth</hi> of <hi>Ieremiah;</hi> now this is not a rule to us, for then, if the <hi>Spaniſh King</hi> ſhould invade this <hi>Iland,</hi> and as <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> did, deface the Temple, and inſtruments and meanes of <hi>Gods Worſhip,</hi> and aboliſh the true worſhip of <hi>God,</hi> it ſhould be unlawfull to reſiſt him, after he had once conquered the <hi>Iland,</hi> neither <hi>Gods</hi> Word, nor the Law of nature could permit this; I ſuppoſe even by grant of adverſaries, now no act of violence done to a people, though in <hi>Gods Court</hi> they have deſerved it, can be a teſtification to us of <hi>Gods regulating Will;</hi> except it have ſome warrant from the Law and teſtimony, it is no rule to our conſcience to acknowledge him a lawfull <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> whoſe ſole law to the Throne is an act of the bloody inſtrument of divine wrath, I meane the ſword. That therefore <hi>Iudah</hi> was to ſubmit, according to Gods Word, to <hi>Nebuchadnezer,</hi> whoſe conſcience and beſt warranted calling to the Kingdome of <hi>Judah</hi> was his bloody ſword, even if we ſuppoſe <hi>Ieremiah</hi> had not commanded them to ſubmit to the<note place="margin">Naked birth is inferiour to the divine unction, which yet made no man a King, without the peoples e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</note>

that <hi>David</hi> had to the Throne, then royall birth, becauſe it is but equivalent only to divine unction, not ſuperiour to divine unction, it cannot have more force to make a <hi>King,</hi> then divine unction.

If royall birth be as juſt a title to the Crowne as divine uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo, as the peoples election is no title at all; then is it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that there ſhould be a King by election in the world now: but the latter is abſurd, ſo is the former. I prove the Propoſition, becauſe where conquerours are wanting, and there is no King for the preſent, but the people governing, and ſo much confuſion aboundeth, they cannot lawfully appoint a <hi>King,</hi> for his lawfull title before <hi>God</hi> muſt either be conqueſt, which to me is no title, (and here, and in this caſe there is no conqueſt) or if the title muſt be a Propheticall word immediatly inſpired by <hi>God,</hi> but this is now ceaſed; or thirdly the title muſt be royal birth, but here there is no royall birth, becauſe the government is popular; except you i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine that the ſociety is obliged in conſcience to goe and ſeek the ſonne of a forraine <hi>King</hi> to be their <hi>King.</hi> But I hope that ſuch a royall birth ſhould not be a juſt title before <hi>God</hi> to make him King of that ſociety, to which he had no relation at all, but is a meere ſtranger. Hence in this caſe no title could be given to any man to make him King, but onely the peoples election; which is that which we ſay. And it is moſt unreaſonable that a people under popular Government cannot lawfully chooſe a <hi>King</hi> to themſelves, ſeeing a <hi>King</hi> is a lawfull Magiſtrate, and warranted by <hi>Gods</hi> Word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have not a <hi>King</hi> of royall birth to ſit upon the throne.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We read in the Word of God, That the people made <hi>Solomon</hi> King, not that <hi>David,</hi> or any King can leave in his Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a Kingdom to his ſon. 2. He ſaith, <hi>The ſon hath not the right</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The heir of a Crown hath the Crown as the patrimony of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, not of the King his father.</note> 
                  <hi>of reigning, as the patrimony of the people, but as a proprietie, given by the Law of the Kingdom, by his parents:</hi> Now this is all one, as if he ſaid, <hi>The ſon hath not the right of the Kingdom, as the patrimony of the people, but as the patrimony of the people,</hi> which is good non-ſenſe; For the proprietie of reigning, given from father to ſon, <hi>by the Law of the Kingdom,</hi> is nothing but a right to reign, given by the Law of the people, and the very gift and patrimony of the people, for <hi>Lex regni,</hi> This Law of the Kingdom is the Law of the people, tying the Crown to ſuch a Royall Family; and this Law of the people is prior and ancienter then the King, or the right of reigning in the King, or which the King is ſuppoſed to have from his Royall father, becauſe it made the firſt father, the firſt King of the Royall Line. For I demand, How doth the ſon ſucceed to his fathers Crown, and Throne? Not by any promiſe of a divine Covenant, that the Lord maketh to the father, as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, <hi>that Davids ſeed ſhould ſit on his throne,</hi> till the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould come: this, as I conceive, is vaniſhed with the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of the Iews, nor can we now finde any immediate divine conſtitution, tying the Crown now to ſuch a race: nor can we ſay, this cometh from the will of the father King, making his ſon King: For 1. there is no Scripture can warrant us to ſay, <hi>The King ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The choice of a family to the Crown, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth upon the free election of the people, as on the fountain-cauſe.</note> 
                  <hi>a King,</hi> but the Scripture holdeth forth, that the people made <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> Kings. 2. This may prove, That the father is ſome way a cauſe, why this ſon ſucceedeth King; but he is not the cauſe of the Royaltie conferred upon the whole Line; becauſe the queſtion is, Who made the firſt father a King? Not himſelf; nor doth God now immediately by Prophets anoint men to be Kings, then need force, the people chooſe the firſt man, then muſt the peoples election of a King, be prior and more ancient then the birth-law to a Crown: And election muſt be a better right then birth. 2. The queſtion is, Whence cometh it that not onely the firſt father ſhould be choſen King; but alſo whence is that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is in the peoples freewill to make the ſucceſſion of Kings go by free election, as it is in <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Pol;</hi> yet the people doth freely chooſe, not only the firſt man to be King, but alſo the whole race of the firſt born of this mans Family to be Kings. All here
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:119219:60"/>
muſt be reſolved in the free will of the Communitie; now ſince we have no immediate and propheticall enthroning of men: it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, That the lineall deduction of the Crown from father to ſon, through the whole line, is from the people, not from the parent.</p>
               <p>Hence I adde this, as my ſixth Argument, That which taketh<note place="margin">6. Argum.</note> away that naturall aptitude, and natures birth-right, in a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie given to them by God and nature, to provide the moſt effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and prevalent mean for their own preſervation and peace in the fitteſt Government, that is not to be holden, but to make birth the beſt title to the Crown, and better then free election, taketh away and impedeth that naturall aptitude, and natures birth-right of choſing, not ſimply a Governour, but the beſt, the juſteſt, the more righteous, and tyeth, and fettereth their choice to one of a houſe, whether he be a wiſe man, and righteous, and juſt, or a fool and an unjuſt man; therefore to make birth the beſt title to the Crown, is not to be holden.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is objected:</hi> That parents may binde their after Generations, to chooſe one of ſuch a line; But by this Argument, their naturall birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right of a free choice, to elect the beſt and fitteſt, is abridged and clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and ſo the poſterity ſhall not be tyed to a King of the Royall Line, to which the Anceſtors did ſwear. <hi>See for this, the learned Author,</hi>

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally: So the firſt born, <hi>ceteris paribus,</hi> be qualified, and have an head to ſit at the helm. 2.

               <p>7. <hi>Argument.</hi> Where God hath not bound the conſcience, men may not binde themſelves, or the conſciences of the poſterity. But God hath not bound any nation irrevocably, and unalterably to a Royall Line, or to one kinde of Government. <hi>Ergo,</hi> No nation can binde their conſcience, and the conſcience of the poſterity, either to one Royall Line, or irrevocably and unalterably to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. The propoſition is clear.</p>
               <p>1. No Nation is tyed, <hi>jure divine,</hi> by the tie of a divine Law to a Monarchy, rather then to another Government. The <hi>Pariſian Doctors</hi> prove, That <hi>the precept of having a Pope is affirmative,</hi> and ſo tyeth not the Church, <hi>ad ſemper,</hi> for ever; and ſo the Church is the body of Chriſt without the Pope; and all oaths to things of their nature indifferent, and to things, the contrary where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is lawfull, and may be expedient and neceſſary, lay on a tie onely conditionally, in ſo far, as they conduce to the end. If the <hi>Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> had riſen in <hi>Joſhuaes</hi> dayes, to cut off the people of God, I think no wiſe man can think, that <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the people were tyed by the oath of God, not to cut off the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> in that caſe: For to preſerve them a live as enemies, was againſt the intent of the oath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was to preſerve them alive, as friends demanding, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating peace, and ſubmitting. The aſſumption is clear If a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeeth that <hi>Ariſtocraticall</hi> Government is better then <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, hic &amp; nunc:</hi> That the ſequels of ſuch a <hi>Monarchy</hi> is bloody, deſtructive, tyrannous, that the <hi>Monarchy</hi> compelleth the free ſubjects to <hi>Turciſme,</hi> to groſſe Idolatry, they cannot by the divine bond of any oath captive their naturall freedom, which is to chooſe a Government, and Governours, for their ſafetie, for a peaceable and godly life; or fetter and chain the wiſdom of the poſterity unalterably to a Government, or a Royall Line, which <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> contrary to the intention of their oath, proveth deſtructive, and bloody. And in this caſe, even the King, though tyed by an oath to govern, is obliged to the practices of the Emperour <hi>Otho.</hi> And as <hi>Speed</hi> ſaith, of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, to reſign the Crown, for the<note place="margin">Speed, Hiſt. pag. 757.</note> eſchewing of the effuſion of blood: And who doubteth but the ſecond wits of the experienced poſterity, may correct the firſt wits of their fathers; nor ſhall I ever beleeve, that the fathers can
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:119219:61"/>
leave in legacie, by oath, any chaines of the beſt gold to fetter the after wits of poſteritie to a choice deſtructive to peace and true Godlineſſe.</p>
               <p>To theſe adde; 8. That 1. an heritor may defraud his firſt borne of his heritage, becauſe of his dominion he hath over his heritage: A King cannot defraud his firſt-borne of the Crown. 2. An heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor may divide his heritage equally amongſt his twelve ſonnes: A King cannot divide his Royall Dominions in twelve parts, and give a part to every ſonne; for ſo he might turne a Monarchie into an <hi>Ariſtocracie,</hi> and put twelve men in the place of one King. 3. Any heritor taken captive, may lawfully oppignorate, yea and give all his inheritance as a ranſome for his liberty; for a man is better then his inheritance: but no King may give his Subjects as a price or ranſome.</p>
               <p>Yet I ſhall not be againſt the ſucceſſion of <hi>Kings</hi> by birth, with good limitations; and ſhall agree, that through the corruption of mans nature, it may be in ſo far profitable, as it is peaceable, and preventeth bloody tumults, which are the bane of humane ſocieties.

               <p>1. <hi>Aſſertion.</hi> A people may be by Gods ſpeciall Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſubject to a conquering <hi>Nebuchadnezer,</hi> and a <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as to their <hi>King,</hi> as was <hi>Iudah</hi> commanded by the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi> to ſubmit unto the yoake of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and to pray for him, and the people of the Iewes were to <hi>give to Caeſar the things of Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar;</hi> and yet both thoſe were unjuſt conquerours: for thoſe Tyrants had no command of <hi>God</hi> to oppreſſe and raigne over the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yet were they to obey thoſe Kings, ſo the paſſive ſubjection was juſt and commanded of God, and the active unjuſt and tyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, and forbidden of God.</p>

If it be ſaid, that the Divine impulſion ſtirring up a man to make a bloody conqueſt, that the ire and juſt indignation of God in Iuſtice may be declared on a wicked Nation, is an extraordinary impulſion of God, who is above a Law, and therefore no man may reſiſt it.

There is a ſubjection in reſpect of naturall being, as the effect to the cauſe, ſo though <hi>Adam</hi> had never ſinned, this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the fifth command, ſhould have ſtood in vigour, that the ſon by nature, without any poſitive Law, ſhould have been ſubject to the father, becauſe from him he hath his being, as from a ſecond cauſe: But I much doubt, if the relation of a father, as a father, doth neceſſarily infer a Royall or Kingly authority of the father over the ſon; or by natures Law, that the father hath power of life and death over, or above his children, and the reaſons I give, are, 1. Becauſe power of life and death is by a poſitive Law, preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing<note place="margin">Power of life and death from a poſitive law, not from the ſuperioritie of father &amp; chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> ſin, and the fall of man; and if <hi>Adam</hi> ſtanding in innocency, could lawfully kill his ſon, though the ſon ſhould be a Malefactor, without any poſitive Law of God, I much doubt. 2. I judge, that the power Royall, and the fatherly power of a father over his children, ſhall be found to be different, and the one is founded on

the Law of nature, the other to wit, Royall power on a meere poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Law. The 2. degree or order of ſubjection naturall, is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection in reſpect of gifts, or age: ſo <hi>Ariſtotle, 1 Polit. cap.</hi> 3. ſaith,<note place="margin">

If any reply, that the freedome naturall of beaſts and birds who never ſinned, cannot be one with the naturall freedome of man who are now under ſin, and ſo under bondage for ſin: my anſwer is, That the ſubjection of the miſerie of man by nature, becauſe of ſinne, is more then the ſubjection of beaſts, comparing ſpece and kind of beaſts and birds with mankind, but comparing individuals of the ſame kinde amongſt themſelves, a <hi>Lyon</hi> with <hi>Lyon, Eagle</hi> with <hi>Eagle,</hi> and ſo Man with Man; in which reſpect, becauſe he who is ſuppoſed to be the man borne free from ſubjection politike, even the <hi>King</hi> borne a <hi>King,</hi> is under the ſame ſtate of ſin, and ſo by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſinne, of which he hath a ſhare equally with all other men by nature, he muſt be, by nature, borne under as great ſubjection pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall for ſinne (except the King be borne voyd of ſinne) as other men; <hi>Ergo,</hi> he is not borne freer by nature then other men, except he<note place="margin">4 Arg.</note> come out of the wombe with a Kings crown on his head. 4. To be a King, is a free gift of <hi>God,</hi> which God beſtoweth on ſome men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove others, as is evident, 2 <hi>Sam. 12. 7, 8. Pſal. 75. 6. Dan.</hi> 4. 32. and

therefore all muſt be borne <hi>Kings,</hi> if any one man be by nature a <hi>King</hi> borne, and another a borne ſubject. But if ſome be by Gods grace made Kings above others, they are not ſo by nature; for things which agree to man by nature, agree to all men equally; but all men equally are not borne Kings, as is evident; and all men are not equally borne by nature under politique ſubjection to <hi>Kings,</hi> as the Adverſaries grant; becauſe thoſe who are by nature <hi>Kings,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be alſo by nature ſubjects. 5.

this incorporation hath looſed the tongues that Nature hath given them, ſo as by Natures law they may not plead in their own juſt &amp; lawfull defence, as if they had never appointed the foreſaid lawyer to plead for them.

               <p>2 <hi>Aſſert.</hi> When the covenant is betwixt God, on the one part, and the King, Prieſts, and people on the other part, it is true, if the one performe for his part to God, the whole duty, the other is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted; as if two men be indebted to one man ten thouſand pounds, if the one pay the whole ſumme, the other is acquitted: but the King and People are not ſo, contracting parties in covenant with <hi>God,</hi> as that they are both indebted to <hi>God</hi> for one and the ſame ſum of compleat obedience, ſo as if the King pay the whole ſumme of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to <hi>God,</hi> the people is acquitted; and if the People pay the whole ſumme, the King is acquitted: for every one ſtandeth obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to <hi>God</hi> for himſelfe; for the people muſt doe all that is their part, in acquitting the King from his <hi>Royall duty,</hi> that they may free him and themſelves both from puniſhment, if he diſobey the <hi>King of Kings:</hi> Nor doth the Kings obedience acquit the people from their duty. And <hi>Arniſaeus</hi> dreamed, if he believed that we make King and People this way partie contractors in covenant with <hi>God.</hi> Nor can two co-partners in covenant with <hi>God,</hi> ſo mutually compell one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to doe their duty; for we hold, that the covenant is made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>King and the People,</hi> betwixt mortall men; but they both bind themſelves before <hi>God</hi> to each other.

mutuall duties one to another: no more then it is neceſſarie that there ſhould be a King and ſuperior Ruler above the <hi>King of Iſrael</hi> and the <hi>King of Iudah,</hi> who ſhould compell each one to doe a duty to his <hi>fellow King;</hi> for the King and People are each of them above, and below others in divers reſpects: The People, becauſe they cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the man <hi>King,</hi> they are ſo above the <hi>King,</hi> and have a virtuall power to compell him to doe his duty: and the <hi>King,</hi> as <hi>King,</hi> hath an authoritative power above the People, becauſe Royaltie is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally in him, and originally and virtually only in the People; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may he compell them to their duty, as we ſhall heare anon; and therefore there is no need of an earthly Ruler higher then both, to compell both.</p>

For in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive covenants that is true, and in ſuch contracts as are made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording<note place="margin">Though there be no poſitive written cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant (which yet we grant not) yet there is a naturall, tacite, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant betwixt the King and ths people.</note> to the Civill or Municipall lawes, or the ſecondary law of Nations: But the generall covenant of nature is preſuppoſed in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a King, where there is no vocall or written covenant, if there be no conditions betwixt a Chriſtian King and his people, then thoſe things which are juſt and right according to the law of God, and the rule of God in moulding the firſt King, are underſtood to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late both King and People, as if they had been written: and here we produce our written covenant, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 15. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1. 8, 9. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Though he were in <hi>mala fide,</hi> and in unjuſt poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the law of Nature will warrant the people to repeal their right, and plead for it, in a matter which concerneth their heads, lives, and ſoules<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. The <hi>Parliaments</hi> of both Kingdomes ſtanding in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a nomothetick power to make lawes, proveth cleerely that the King is in no poſſeſſion of any Royall dignitie conferred <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely</hi> and without any condition upon him: and therefore it is the Kings part by law to put the Eſtates out of poſſeſſion. And ſo
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:119219:75"/>
though there were no written covenant, the ſtanding law and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of many hundreth acts of Parliament, is equivalent to a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten covenant.</p>
               <p>2. When the people appointeth any to be their <hi>King,</hi> the voyce of Nature exponeth their deed, though there be no vocall or writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten covenant; For that fact of making a King, is a morall lawfull act warranted by the word of <hi>God,</hi> Deut. 17. 15, 16. Rom. 13. 1. 2. and the law of Nature: and therefore they having made ſuch a man their King, they have given him power to be their father, feeder, healer, protector; and ſo muſt only have made him King <hi>conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,</hi> ſo he be a father, a feeder, and tutor. Now if this deed of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a King, muſt be exponed to be an inveſting with an abſolute, and not a conditionall power; this fact ſhall be contrary to Scripture, and to the law of Nature: for if they have given him Royall power<note place="margin">If the King be made King abſolutely, he is made ſuch an one contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the word of God and nature of his office.</note> abſolutely, and without any condition, they muſt have given to him power to be a father, protector, tutor, and to be a tyrant, a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, a bloody lyon to waſte and deſtroy the people of God.</p>
               <p>3. The Law permitteth the beſtower of a benefit to interpret his own mind in the beſtowing of a benefit, even as a King and State muſt expone their own Commiſſion given to their Ambaſſadour, ſo muſt the Eſtates expone whether they beſtowed the Crown upon the firſt King <hi>conditionally</hi> or <hi>abſolutely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the 4th. if it ſtand, then muſt the people give to their firſt elected King a power to waſt and deſtroy themſelves, ſo as they may never controle it, but only leave it to <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon together, but ſo the condition is a Chimera (<hi>We give you a Throne, upon condition you ſwear by him who made heaven and earth, that you will govern us according to Gods Law; and you ſhall be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to God only, not to us, whether you keep the covenant you make with us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or violate it;</hi>) but how a covenant can be made with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the <hi>King</hi> obliged to <hi>God,</hi> not to the people, I conceive not. 2.

               <p>But the people are given to the King to be tutored and protected of him, ſo as they remaine the people of <hi>God,</hi> and in covenant with him, and if the people were the goods of fortune (as <hi>Heathens</hi> ſay) he could no more ſinne againſt the people then a man can ſin againſt his gold; now though a man by adoring gold, or by laviſh profuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and waſting of gold may ſin againſt God, yet not againſt gold; nor can he be in any covenant with gold, or under any obligation of either duty or ſin to gold, or to liveleſſe and reaſonleſſe creatures properly, therefore he may ſin in the uſe of them, and yet not ſin againſt them, but againſt <hi>God.</hi> Hence of neceſſity the King muſt be under obligation to the Lords people in another manner, then that he ſhould only anſwer to <hi>God,</hi> for the loſſe of men, as if men were worldly goods under his hand, and as if being a King he were now by this Royall Authority priviledged from the beſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>halfe of the law of nature, to wit, from acts of mercy, and truth, and covenant kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping with his brethren.<note place="margin">The King could not buy or ſell, borrow or contract debt if his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with men did not bind him.</note>

               <p>2.

So let the Prelate glory in his borrowed Logick, he had it from <hi>Barclay. It is not in the power of the Wife to repudiat her Husband, though never ſo wicked, ſhe is tyed to him for ever, and may not give to him a bill of Divorcement, as by Law the Husband might give to her; if therefore the people ſweare loyalty to him, they muſt keep, though to their hurt.</hi> Pſ. 15. <hi>Aaſ.</hi> There's

nothing here ſaid, except <hi>Barclay</hi> and the <hi>Plagiarie</hi> prove, that the Kings Power is properly a Husbands power, which they cannot prove, but from a Simile that crooketh; but a King elected upon conditions, that if he ſell his people, he ſhall loſe his Crown, is as eſſentially a King, as <hi>Adam</hi> was <hi>Evahs</hi> Husband, and yet by grant of parties, the people may devorce from ſuch a <hi>King,</hi> and dethrone him, if he ſell his people; but a Wife may never devorce from her Husband, as the Argument ſaith.

                  <hi>King</hi> is not the adequate and totall Politique head of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: and therefore though you cut off a <hi>Politique head,</hi> there's nothing done againſt nature.

are different in eſſence and nature; ſo that domination is ſo eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall to a King, that <hi>you cannot conceive a King, but he muſt have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, whereas the Iudges of</hi> Iſrael <hi>had no domination over the people.</hi> Hence I argue that, whereby a King is eſſentially diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from a Iudge, that muſt be from God; but by domination, which is a power to oppreſſe the ſubject, a King is eſſentially di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from a Iudge of <hi>Iſrael.

Now if the kingly power be from God, That which eſſentially and ſpecifically conſtituteth a King, muſt be from God, as the Office it ſelf is from God: And <note n="d" place="margin">

Is there no lawfull reſiſting of ills of puniſhment, but meere prayers and patience? The <hi>Amalikites</hi> came out againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> for their ſinnes, <hi>Senahkerib</hi> againſt <hi>Ezekiah,</hi> for the ſins of the people. <hi>Aſa</hi> his enemies fought againſt him for his ſins, and the peoples ſins; ſhall <hi>Moſes</hi> and the people, <hi>Hezekiah, Aſa,</hi> do then nothing but pray and ſuffer?

                  <hi>Obſerve therefore the wickedneſſe of</hi> Barclay, contra Monarch. l. 2. p. 56. <hi>for he would prove, that</hi> a power of doing ill, and that without any puniſhment to be inflicted by man, is from God; becauſe our Lawes puniſh not perjurie, but leaveth it to be puniſhed of God, l. 2. l. de Reb. cred. Cujacius, l. 2. obſ. c. 19. And the husband in Moſes his law, had power to give a bill of divorce to his wife, and ſend her away; and the husband was not to be puniſhed. And alſo Stewes and work-houſes for harlots, and to take uſurie, are tolerated in many Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths, and yet theſe are all ſorts of murthers, by the confeſſion of Heathen: Ergo, (<hi>ſaith</hi> Barclaius) God may give a power for Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous acts to Kings, ſo as they ſhall be under no puniſhment to be inflicted by men.</p>
               <p>

greater ſinnes: Therefore <hi>God</hi> hath given power to a King to play the <hi>Tyrant,</hi> without any feare of puniſhment to be inflicted by man. But 1. if this be a good argument, The Magiſtrate to whom <hi>God</hi> hath committed the ſword <hi>to take vengeance on evill doers, Rom.</hi> 13. 3, 4, 5, 6. ſuch as are perjured perſons, profeſſed whores and harlots, hath a lawfull power from <hi>God</hi> to connive at ſinnes and groſſe ſcandals in the Commonwealth, as they dreame that the <hi>King</hi> hath power given from <hi>God</hi> to exerciſe all acts of Tyranny without any reſiſtance. But, 1. this was a grievous ſinne in <hi>Eli,</hi> that he being a father and a Iudge, puniſhed not his ſonnes for their uncleanneſſe, and his houſe, in Gods heavy diſpleaſure, was cut off from the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood therefore. Then <hi>God</hi> hath given no ſuch power to the Iudge. 2. The contrary duty is lying on the Iudge, <hi>To execute judgement for the oppreſſed,</hi> Iob 29. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. Ier. 22. 15, 16. and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of judgement, and conniving at the heynous ſinnes of the wicked, is condemned, <hi>Num.</hi> 5. 31, 32. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 23. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20. 42, 43. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1. 17. &amp; 10. 1. &amp; 5, 23. and therefore <hi>God</hi> hath given no power to a Iudge to permit wicked men to commit grievous crimes, without any puniſhment. As for the <hi>Law of Divorce,</hi> it was indeed a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive law, whereby the husband might give the wife a <hi>bill of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce,</hi> and be free of puniſhment before men, but not free of ſinne and guiltineſſe before <hi>God,</hi> for it was contrary to Gods inſtitution of Mariage at the beginning, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith: and the Prophet ſaith,<note place="margin">Mal. 2.</note> that the <hi>Lord hateth putting away.</hi> But that <hi>God</hi> hath given any ſuch permiſſive power to the <hi>King,</hi> that he may doe what he pleaſeth, and cannot be reſiſted: This is in queſtion. 3. The Law ſpoken of in the Text, is by <hi>Royaliſts</hi> called, not a <hi>conſuetude of Tranny,</hi> but the <hi>divine law of God, whereby the King is formally and eſſentially diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the Judge in Iſrael:</hi> Now if ſo, a power to ſinne, and a power to commit acts of <hi>Tyranny,</hi> yea, and a power in the Kings Sergeants and bloody Emiſſaries to waſte and deſtroy the people of God, muſt be a lawfull power given of <hi>God:</hi> for a lawfull power it muſt be, if it commeth from God, whether it be from the <hi>King</hi> in his own perſon, or from his ſervants at his commandement, and by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther put forth in acts, as the power of a bill of Divorce was a power from <hi>God,</hi> exempting either the husband from puniſhment before men, or freeing the ſervant, who at the husbands command, ſhould write it, and put it in the hands of the woman. I cannot beleeve that <hi>God</hi> hath given a power, and that by Law, to one Man to command
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:119219:91"/>
twenty thouſand Cut-throats to kill and deſtroy all the Children of <hi>God,</hi> and that he hath commanded his Children to give their necks and heads to <hi>Babels ſonnes</hi> without reſiſtance. This I am ſure is another matter then a Law for a bill of Divorce to one woman, maried by free election of a humorous and unconſtant man. But ſure I am, <hi>God</hi> gave no permiſſive law from heaven, like the law of Divorce, for the hardneſſe of the heart, not of the Iewes only, but alſo of the whole Chriſtian and Heathen Kingdomes under a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch; that one Emperour may, by ſuch a Law of God, as the Law of Divorce, kill, by bloody Cut-throats, ſuch as the Iriſh Rebels are, all the Nations that call on Gods name, men, women, and ſucking infants. And if Providence impede the Catholike iſſue, and dry up the ſeas of Blood, it is good: but <hi>God</hi> hath given a law, ſuch as the law of Divorce, to the King, whereby he, and all his, may without reſiſtance, by a legall power given of <hi>God,</hi> who giveth Kings to be fathers, nurſes, protectors, guides, yea the breath of noſtrils of his <hi>Church,</hi> as ſpeciall mercies and bleſſings to his people, he may (I ſay) by a law of <hi>God,</hi> as it is 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 9, 11. cut off Nations, as that Lyon of the world, <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> did.

Theſe meanes, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> which referre their whole nature to the end, and have all their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie from the end, and have excellencie from no other thing but from the end, are leſſe excellent then the end; that is true, ſuch an end as medicine is for health. <hi>And</hi> Hugo Grotius, <hi>l. 1. c. 3. n. 8.</hi> Thoſe meanes which are only for the end, &amp; for the good of the end, and are not for their own good, alſo are of leſſe excellencie, and inferior to the end. But ſo the aſſumption is falſe. But thoſe meanes which beſide their relation to the end, have an excellencie of nature in themſelves, are not alwayes infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to the end. The Diſciple, as he is inſtituted, is inferior to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; but as he is the ſonne of a Prince, he is above the Maſter. But by this reaſon, the ſhepherd ſhould be inferior to bruit beaſts, to ſheep. And the maſter of the familie is for the familie, and referreth all that he hath for the entertaining of the familie: but it followeth not therefore the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie is above him. The forme is for the action, therefore the action is

                  <hi>as relative to the end.</hi> All that you can imagine to be in a <hi>King,</hi> as a <hi>King,</hi> is all relative to the ſafety and good of the people, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. <hi>He is a miniſter for thy good.</hi> He ſhould not, as <hi>King,</hi> make himſelfe, or his own gaine and honour, his end. I grant, the <hi>King,</hi> as a man, ſhall dye as another man, and ſo he may ſecondarily intend his own good; and what excellencie he hath as a man, is the excellencie of one mortall man, and cannot make him amount in dignitie, and in the abſolute conſideration of the excellencie of a man, to be above many men and a whole Kingdome: for the moe good things there be, the better they are, ſo the good things be multiplicable, as a hundred men are better then one: Otherwiſe, if the good be ſuch as cannot be multiplied, as <hi>one God,</hi> the multiplication maketh them<note place="margin">The King both as a man, and as a King inferior to the people.</note> worſe, as <hi>many Gods</hi> are inferiour to <hi>one God.</hi> Now if <hi>Royaliſts</hi> can ſhew us any more in the <hi>King</hi> then theſe two, we ſhall be obliged to them; and in both, he is inferiour to the whole.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Prelate</hi> and his followers would have the Maxime to loſe credit; for then (ſay they) <hi>the ſhepherd ſhould be inferior to the ſheep:</hi> But in this the <hi>Maxime</hi> faileth indeed. 1. Becauſe the ſhepherd is a reaſonable man, and the ſheep bruit beaſts, and ſo muſt be excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then all the flocks of the world. Now as he is a reaſonable man, he is not a ſhepherd, nor in that relation referred to the ſheep and their preſervation, as a mean to the end; but he is a ſhepherd by accident, for the unrulineſſe of the creatures, for mans ſinne, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing themſelves from that naturall dominion that man had over the creatures, before the fall of man: in that relation of a meane to the end, and ſo by accident, is this officiall relation put on him; and according to that officiall relation, and by accident, man is put to be a ſervant to the bruitiſh creature, and a meane to ſo baſe an end. But all this proveth him, through mans ſinne, and by accident, to be under the officiall relation of a meane, to baſer creatures then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as to the end, but not as a reaſonable man. But the King, as King, is an officiall and Royall meane to this end, that the people

may <hi>lead a godly and peaceable life under him.</hi> And this <hi>officiall rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> being an accident, is of leſſe worth then the whole people, as they are to be governed. And I grant, the <hi>Kings</hi> ſonne, in relation to blood and birth, is more excellent then his Teachers: but as he is taught, he is inferiour to his Teacher: but in both conſiderations the <hi>King</hi> is inferior to the people; for though he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand the people, and ſo have an <hi>executive power</hi> of law above them, yet have they a <hi>fountain power</hi> above him, becauſe they made him King, and in Gods intention he is given as King for their good, according to that, <hi>Thou ſhalt feed my people Iſrael:</hi> &amp; that, <hi>I gave him for a leader of my people.</hi>

Next, it is ſuch as is effective and productive of it ſelfe, as when fire heateth cold water, ſo the quality muſt be formally inherent in the Agent, as Wine maketh drunke, it followeth not, Wine is more drunke, becauſe Drunkenneſſe is not inherent in the Wine, nor is it capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of drunkenneſſe; and therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> qualifieth the Maxime with this, <hi>Quod efficit tale eſt magis tale, modo utrique inſit.</hi> And it holdeth not in Agents, who operate by donation, if the right of the King be transferred from the people to the King. The donation deveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the people totally of it, except the King have it by way of loane, which to my thinking, never yet any ſpoke—Soveraignty never was, never can be in the Community; Soveraignty hath power of life and death, which none hath over himſelfe, and the community conceived without government, all as equall, endowed with Natures and native liberty, of that community can have no power over the life of another. And ſo the Argument may be turned home, if the people be not <hi>tales,</hi> ſuch by nature (as hath formally Royall power, he ſhould ſay) they cannot give the King Royall Power.

                  <hi>in the Communitie</hi> (ſaith the P. Prelate.) Truly it neither is, nor can be, more then ten, or a thouſand, or a thouſand thouſands, or a whole Kingdome can be one man; for Soveraigntie is the abſtract, the Soveraigne is the concrete: Many cannot be one <hi>King</hi> or one <hi>Soveraigne:</hi> a Soveraigne muſt be eſſentially one; and a multitude cannot be one: but what then? may not the Soveraigne power be <hi>eminently, fontaliter; originallp</hi> and <hi>radically</hi> in the people? I thinke it may, and muſt be, A <hi>King</hi> is not an under-Iudge, he is not a Lord of Councell or Seſſion formally, becauſe he is more: The people is not <hi>King</hi> formally, becauſe the people is eminently more then the <hi>King;</hi> for they make <hi>David</hi> King, and <hi>Saul</hi> King. And the power to make a Lord of Councell aud Seſſion, is in the <hi>King</hi> (ſay <hi>Royaliſts.) 8. A Communitie hath not power of life and death. A King hath power of life and death,</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Prelate</hi>) What then? <hi>ergo,</hi> a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie is not <hi>King.</hi> I grant all. But (poore man!) <hi>Ergo,</hi> the power of making a King, who hath power of life and death, is not in the people. It is like Prelates logick. <hi>Samuel</hi> is not a King; <hi>ergo,</hi> he cannot make <hi>David</hi> a King. It followeth not, by the Prelates ground. So the <hi>King</hi> is not an in inferiour Iudge: What? <hi>ergo,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Power of life and death, how in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie.</note> he cannot make an inferiour Iudge. 9. The power of life and death is <hi>eminently</hi> and <hi>virtually</hi> in the people, collectively taken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though not formally.

reſpect they may render themſelves to a <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> and to Lawes, which if they violate, they muſt be in hazard of their lives, and ſo they virtually have power of their own lives, by putting them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of good lawes for the peace and ſafety of the whole. 10. This is a weake conſequence: None hath power of his owne life, <hi>Ergo,</hi> far leſſe of his neighbours (ſaith the Prelate.) I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the conſequence. The King hath not power of his own life, that is, according to the Prelates mind, he can neither by the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor by any Civill law. kill himſelfe: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the King hath far leſſe power to kill another. It followeth not: for the Iudge hath more power over his neighbours life, then over his own. 11. But, ſaith the P. Prelate, <hi>The Communitie conceived without government,</hi>

But a Communitie in this conſideration, as they come from the wombe, have no Politique conſideration at all. If you conſider them as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all policie, you cannot conſider them as inveſted with policie: yea if you conſider them ſo as they are by nature, voyd of all poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, they cannot ſo much as adde their after-conſent and approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſuch a man to be their <hi>King,</hi> whom <hi>God</hi> immediately from heaven maketh a <hi>King:</hi> for to adde ſuch an after-conſent, is an act of government. Now as they are conceived to want all government, they cannot performe any act of government. And this is as much againſt himſelfe, as againſt us.</p>
               <p>2. The power of a part, and the power of the whole is not alike, <hi>Royaltie</hi> never advanceth the <hi>King</hi> above the place of a member: And Lawyers ſay, The King is above the ſubjects, <hi>in ſenſu diviſo,</hi> in a diviſive ſenſe he is above this or that ſubject: but he is inferiour to all the ſubjects collectively taken, becauſe he is for the whole Kingdome, as a meane for the end. <hi>Object. If this be a good reaſon, that he is a meane for the whole Kingdome, as for the end; that he is therefore inferiour to the whole Kingdome: then is he alſo inferior to any one ſubject; for he is a meane for the ſafety of every ſubject, as for the whole Kingdome.

               <p>IT is certain that in one and the ſame Kingdom, the power of the King is more in extenſion, then the power of any inferiour Iudge: but if theſe powers of the King, and the inferiour Iudges differ <hi>intenfivè</hi> and in <hi>ſpece,</hi> and nature, is the queſtion, though it be not all the queſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſſert.</hi> Inferiour Iudges are no leſſe eſſentially Iudges, and the immediate Vicars of God, then the King. 1. Theſe who judge in<note place="margin">Inferiour Iudges no leſſe Gods imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Vicars then the King.</note> the room of God, and exerciſe the judgement of God, are eſſential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Iudges, and the Deputies of God, as well as the King: but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Iudges are ſuch. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The propoſition is clear, the formall reaſon, why the King is univocally and eſſentially a Iudge is, becauſe the Kings throne is the Lords throne, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 23. And <hi>Solomon ſate on the throne of the Lord, as King, inſtead of David his father, 1 King.</hi> 1. 13. It is called <hi>Davids</hi> throne, becauſe the King is the Deputy of <hi>Iehovah,</hi> and the judgement is the Lords: I prove the aſſumption. Inferiour Iudges appointed by King <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> have this place, 2 <hi>Chro. 19. 6. The King ſaid to the Iudges, Take heed what ye do,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord:</hi> then they were Deputies in the place of the Lord, and not the Kings Deputies in the formall and officiall acts of judging. 7. <hi>Wherefore now let the fear of the Lord be upon you, take heed and do it, for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, nor reſpect of perſons, or taking of gifts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence I argue, If the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in this good <hi>King,</hi> forbid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Judges <hi>wreſting of judgement, reſpecting of perſons, and taking of gifts,</hi> becauſe the <hi>judgement is the Lords;</hi> and if the <hi>Lord</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf were on the Bench, he would not reſpect perſons, nor take gifts; then he preſumeth, that inferiour Iudges are in the ſtead and place of <hi>Jehovah:</hi> and that when theſe inferiour Iudges ſhould take gifts, they make (as it were) the Lord, whoſe place they repreſent, to take gifts, and to do iniquitie, and to reſpect perſons: but that the holy Lord cannot do. 2. If the inferiour Iudges in the act of judging, were the Vicars, and Deputies of King <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> he would have ſaid, <hi>Judge righteous judgement; Why? For the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:119219:102"/>
is mine, and if I the King were on the Bench, I would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect perſons, nor take gifts; and you judge for me the ſupreme Judge, as my Deputies:</hi> but the King ſaith, They <hi>judge not for man, but for the Lord.</hi> 3. If by this they were not Gods immediate Vicars, but the Vicars and Deputies of the King, then being meer ſervants, the King might command them to pronounce ſuch a ſentence, and not ſuch a ſentence as I may command my ſervant and deputy, in ſo far, as he is a ſervant and deputie, to ſay this, and ſay not this: but the <hi>King</hi> cannot limit the conſcience of the inferiour Iudge, becauſe the judgement is not the <hi>Kings,</hi> but the Lords. 4. The <hi>King</hi> cannot command any other to do that, as King; for the doing whereof, he hath no power from God himſelf, but the King hath no power from God to pronounce what ſentence he pleaſeth, becauſe the judgement is not his own, but Gods: And though inferiour Iudges be <hi>ſent of</hi>

The <hi>Iudges</hi> were raiſed up in an extraordinary manner, out of any Tribe, to defend the people, and vindicate their libertie, <hi>God</hi> remaining their <hi>King:</hi> the <hi>King</hi> by the Lords appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was tyed, after <hi>Saul,</hi> to the Royall tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> till the Meſſiahs comming. God tooke his own bleſſed libertie to ſet up a ſucceſſion in the ten tribes- 2. The Iudges were not by ſucceſſion from father to ſonne: the Kings were, as I conceive, for the typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call eternitie of the Meſſiahs throne, preſignified to ſtand from ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to generation. 3. Whether the Iudges were appointed by the election of the people, or no, ſome doubt, becauſe <hi>Iepthah</hi> was ſo made Iudge: but I thinke it was not a law in Iſrael that it ſhould be ſo: but the firſt mould of a King, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. is by electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But that God gave power of domineering, that is, of Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing, to a King, ſo as he cannot be reſiſted, which he gave not to a Iudge, I thinke no Scripture can make good: For by what Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can Royaliſts warrant to us that the people might riſe in armes to defend themſelves againſt <hi>Moſes, Gideon, Eli, Samuel,</hi> and other Iudges, if they ſhould have tyrannized over the people: and that it is unlawfull to reſiſt the moſt Tyrannous King in Iſrael and Iudah?
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:119219:107"/>
Yet <hi>Barclay</hi> and others muſt ſay this, if they be true to that principle of Tyranny, That the <hi>jus Regis,</hi> the law or manner of the King, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 9, 11. &amp; 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 25, doth eſſentially difference betwixt the <hi>Kings of Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>the Iudges of Iſrael:</hi> but we thinke <hi>God</hi> gave never any power of Tyranny to either Iudge or King of Iſrael; and domination in that ſenſe was by <hi>God</hi> given to none of them. 2. <hi>Arniſaeus</hi> hath as little for him, to ſay the inferior Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate may be reſiſted, becauſe we may appeale from him: but the <hi>King</hi> cannot be reſiſted, <hi>quia ſanctitas Majeſtatis id non permittit,</hi> the ſanctitie of Royall majeſtie will not permit us to reſiſt the King. <hi>Anſ.</hi> That is not <hi>Pauls</hi> argument, to prove it unlawfull to reſiſt <hi>Kings,</hi> as <hi>Kings,</hi> and doing their office, becauſe of the ſanctitie of their Majeſtie, that is, as the man intendeth, becauſe of the ſupreme abſolute and illimited power that God hath given him. But this is a begging of the queſtion, and all one as to ſay, <hi>the King may not be reſiſted, becauſe he may not be reſiſted:</hi> for ſanctitie of Majeſtie, if we beleeve <hi>Royaliſts,</hi> includeth eſſentially an abſolute ſupremacie of power, whereby they are above the reach of all thrones, lawes, powers, or reſiſtance on Earth. But the Argument is, <hi>Reſiſt</hi> not, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Power is of God.</hi> But the inferiour Magiſtrates power is of God. 2.

               <p>11. If the <hi>King</hi> through abſolute power doe not ſend inferiour<note place="margin">Arg. 11.</note> Iudges, and conſtitute them, but only by a power from the people; and if the Lord have no leſſe immediate influence in making inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Iudges, then in making <hi>Kings,</hi> then is there no ground that the<note place="margin">God, not the abſolute Prince, maketh the inferiour Iudges.</note> King ſhould be ſole Iudge, and the inferiour Iudge only Iudge by derivation from him, and eſſentially his Deputy, and not the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Deputy of <hi>God.</hi> But the former is true, <hi>ergo</hi> ſo is the latter. And firſt that the Kings abſolute Will maketh not inferiour Iudges, is cleare, from <hi>Deut. 1. 15. Moſes</hi> might not follow his owne will in making inferiour Iudges whom he pleaſed: <hi>God</hi> tyed him to a Law, v. 13. that he ſhould <hi>take wiſe men, known amongſt the people, and fearing God, and hating covetouſneſſe.</hi> And theſe qualifications were not from <hi>Moſes,</hi> but from <hi>God;</hi> and no leſſe immediatly from <hi>God</hi> then the inward qualification of a King, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. and therefore it is not Gods Law that the King may make inferiour Iudges only, <hi>Durante beneplacito,</hi> during his abſolute will; for if theſe Divine qualifications remaine in the ſeventy Elders, <hi>Moſes</hi> at his will could not remove them from their places. 2. That the King can make heritable Iudges more then he can communicate faculties and parts of judging, I doubt, <hi>riches are of fathers,</hi> but not promotion, which<note place="margin">No heritable Iudges accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods Word.</note> is from God, and neither from the Eaſt, nor the Weſt. That our Nobles are borne Lords of Parliament, and Iudges by blood, is a poſitive Law. 3. It ſeemeth to me from <hi>Eſay</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3, 4. that the inferiour Iudge is made by conſent of the people, nor can it be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a wronging of the King, that all cities and Burroughs of <hi>Scotland</hi>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:119219:108"/>
and <hi>England,</hi> have power to chooſe their owne <hi>Proveſts, Rulers,</hi> and <hi>Majors.</hi> 4. If it be warranted by <hi>God,</hi> that the lawfull Call of <hi>God</hi> to the Throne, be the election of the people, the call of inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Iudges muſt alſo be from the people, mediatly or immediatly: So I ſee no ground to ſay that, the inferiour Iudge is the Kings Vicegerent, or that he is in reſpect of the King, or in relation to ſupreme Authority, only a private man.</p>
               <p>12. Theſe Iudges cannot but be univocally and eſſentially Iudges, no leſſe then the King, without which in a Kingdome Iuſtice is Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically unpoſſible: and <hi>Anarchie</hi> and violence and confuſion muſt follow, if they be wanting in the Kingdome. But without inferiour Iudges, though there be a King, Iuſtice is Phyſically unpoſſible, and <hi>Anarchie</hi> and confuſion muſt follow, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now this Argument is more conſiderable, that without inferiour Iudges, though there be a King in a Kingdome, Iuſtice and ſafety are unpoſſible, and if there be inferiour Iudges, though there be no King, as in <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> and when the King is dead, and another not Crowned, or the King is Minor, or abſent, or a captive in the enemies Land, yet juſtice is poſſible, and the Kingdome preſerved; the Medium of the Argument is grounded upon Gods Word, <hi>Num.</hi> 11. 14, 15. when <hi>Moſes</hi> is unable alone to judge the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,<note place="margin">Inferiour Iudges more neceſſary in a large Kingdom then the Kfng, and fo <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy</hi> in that more ſutable to the naturall end of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</hi>

Becauſe when <hi>Moſes,</hi> by <hi>Gods</hi> rule, hath appointed ſeventie men to be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Iudges in the Land, <hi>Moſes</hi> upon his ſole pleaſure and will, hath not power to reſtraine them in the exerciſe of judgment gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven<note place="margin">The inferiour Iudges are not ſubject in their conſcience to the King, in their acts of judgement, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>quoad spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificationem,</hi> to give unjuſt ſentences at his will; nor <hi>quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad exercitium,</hi> to execute, or not execute judgement for the oppreſſed.</note> them of <hi>God:</hi> for as <hi>God</hi> hath given to any one Iudge power to judge righteous judgement, though the King command the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; ſo hath he given to him power to ſit down in the gate, or the bench, when and where the neceſſitie of the oppreſſed people cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth for it: For, 1. the expreſſe commandement of <hi>God,</hi> which ſaith to all Iudges, <hi>Execute judgement in the morning;</hi> involveth eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally a precept to all the Phyſicall actions, without which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to execute judgement: As namely, if by a divine precept the Iudge muſt execute judgement; <hi>ergo,</hi> he muſt come to ſome publique place, and he muſt cauſe partie and witneſſes come before him, and he muſt conſider, cognoſce, examine in the place of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, things, perſons, circumſtances: and ſo <hi>God</hi> who comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth poſitive acts of judgeing, commandeth the Iudges locomotive power, and his naturall actions of compelling by the ſword the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to come before him: even as Chriſt who commandeth his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to preach, commandeth that the Preacher and the People goe to <hi>Church,</hi> and that he ſtand or ſit in a place where all may heare, and that he give himſelfe to reading and meditating, before he come to preach. And if <hi>God</hi> command one Iudge to come to the place of judgement, ſo doth he command ſeventie, and ſo all Eſtates to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veen in the place of judgement. It is objected, <hi>That the Eſtates are not Iudges ordinary and habitually, but only Iudges at ſome certaine occaſions, when the King, for cogent and weighty cauſes, calleth them, and calleth them not to judge, but to give him adviſe and counſell how to judge.

A reſtraint from Gods law is vaine: for it is no queſtion between us and <hi>Royaliſts,</hi> but <hi>God</hi> hath laid a morall reſtraint on <hi>Kings,</hi> and all men, that they have not morall power to ſinne againſt <hi>God.</hi> 2. Is the reſtraint laid on by mans law? What law of man? 1. The <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſt</hi> ſaith, 1. The <hi>King,</hi> as <hi>King,</hi> is above all law of man. Then (ſay I) no law of man can hinder the Kings power of ten, to ariſe to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> power of foureteen. 2. All law of man, as it is mans law, is ſeconded either with Eccleſiaſticall and ſpirituall coaction, ſuch as Excommunication; <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>or with Civill and temporall coaction, ſuch as is the Sword, if it be violated. But <hi>Royaliſts</hi> deny, that either the ſword of the Church in Excommunication, or the Civill ſword, ſhould be drawn againſt the <hi>King.</hi> 3. This law of man ſhould be produced by this profound Iuriſt, the <hi>P. Prelate,</hi> who mocketh at all the Statiſts and Lawyers of <hi>Scotland.</hi> It is not a covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> at his Coronation: for though there were any ſuch covenant, yet the breach of it doth binde before <hi>God,</hi> but not before man: nor can I ſee, or any man elſe, how a law of man can lay a reſtraint on the Kings power of two degrees, to can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell it within a Law, more then on a power of ten, or fourteene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. If the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> the lawfull Soveraigne of thoſe <hi>over-European</hi>

people, (as <hi>Royaliſts</hi> ſay) have a power of foureteene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees over thoſe conquered Subjects, as a <hi>King;</hi> I ſee not how he hath not the like power over his own Subjects of <hi>Spaine,</hi> to wit, even of Foureteen: for what agreeth to a <hi>King,</hi> as a <hi>King,</hi> (and <hi>Kingly</hi> power from God he hath as <hi>King</hi>) he hath it in relation to all Subjects, except it be taken from him in relation to ſome Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and given by ſome law of God; or in relation to ſome other Subjects. Now, no man can produce any ſuch law. 4. The nature of the goodneſſe and grace of the Prince, cannot lay bonds on the <hi>King,</hi> to cancell his power, that he ſhould not uſurpe the power of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> toward his <hi>over-Europeans. 1. Royaliſts</hi> plead for a power due to the <hi>King,</hi> as <hi>King,</hi> and that from God; ſuch as <hi>Saul</hi> had, 1 <hi>Sam. 8. 9, 11. 1 Sam.</hi> 10. 25. But this power ſhould be a power of grace and goodneſſe in the King, <hi>as a good man;</hi> not in the King, <hi>as a King,</hi> and due to him by law: And ſo the <hi>King</hi> ſhould have his Legall power from God, to be a Tyrant. But if he were not a Tyrant, but ſhould lay limits on his own power, through the goodneſſe of his own nature; No thankes to <hi>Royaliſts</hi> that he is not a Tyrant: For, <hi>actu primo,</hi> and as he is a <hi>King,</hi> (as they ſay) he is a Tyrant, having from God a Tyrannous power of ten degrees, as <hi>Saul</hi> had, 1 Sam. 8. and why not of foureteen degrees, as well as the Great <hi>Turke,</hi> or the <hi>King of Spaine?</hi> if he uſe it not, it is his own perſonall goodneſſe, not his officiall and Royall power. 4. The raſtraint of Providence laid by God upon any power to doe ill, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth only the exerciſe of the power not to breake forth in as Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannous acts as ever the <hi>King of Spaine,</hi> or the <hi>great Turke</hi> can exerciſe toward any. Yea, <hi>Providence</hi> layeth Phyſicall reſtraint, and poſſibly morall, ſometimes, upon the exerciſe of that power that <hi>Devils,</hi> and the moſt wicked men of the world hath: but <hi>Royaliſts</hi> muſt ſhew us that Providence hath laid bounds on the <hi>Kings</hi> power, and made it fatherlie, and not maſterly; ſo that if it the power ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed bounds of fatherly power, and paſſe over to the diſpoticall and maſterly power, it may be reſiſted by the Subjects. But that they will not ſay. 4. This paternall and fatherly power that God hath given to Kings, as Royaliſts teach, <hi>it trencheth not upon the libertie of the Subjects, and propertie of their goods; but in, and by lawfull and juſt acts of Juriſdiction</hi> (ſaith the <hi>P. Prelate:</hi>) Well; Then it may trench upon the libertie of ſoule and body of the Subjects; but <hi>in, and by lawfull and juſt acts of of juriſdiction:</hi> But none are to judge
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:119219:114"/>
of theſe acts of Iuriſdiction, whether they be <hi>juſt</hi> or not <hi>juſt,</hi> but the <hi>King,</hi> the only Iudge of ſupreme and abſolute authoritie and power. And if the <hi>King</hi> command the idolatrous ſervice in the obtruded Service-booke, it is a lawfull and a juſt <hi>act of juriſdiction:</hi> For to <hi>Royaliſts,</hi> who make the Kings power abſolute, all acts are ſo juſt to the Subject, though he command Idolatrie and Turciſme, that we are to ſuffer only, and not to reſiſt. 5. The Prelate preſumeth that Fatherly power is abſolute: But ſo if a father murther his childe, he is not comptable to the Magiſtrate therefore; but being abſolute over his children, only the Judge of the World, not any power on earth can puniſh him. 6. We have proved that the <hi>Kings</hi> power is pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall or fatherly only, by analogie, and improperly. 7. What is this Prerogative Royall, we ſhall heare by and by, 8. There is no reſtraint on Earth, laid upon this fatherly power of the King, but Gods law, which is a morall reſtraint. If then the King challenge as great a power as the Turke hath, he only ſinneth againſt <hi>God;</hi> but no mortall man on earth may controll him, as <hi>Royaliſts</hi> teach: and who can know what power it is that <hi>Royaliſts</hi> plead for, whether a diſpoticall power of Lordly power, or a fatherly power? If it be a power above law, ſuch as none on earth may reſiſt it; it is no matter whether it be above law of two degrees, or of twenty, even to the <hi>Great Turkes</hi> power.</p>

The Law is <hi>ratio ſive mens,</hi> the reaſon or minde, free from all perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of anger, luſt, hatred, and cannot be tempted to ill; and the <hi>King,</hi> as a man, may be tempted by his own paſſions; and therefore as <hi>King,</hi> he commeth by office out of himſelfe to reaſon and law; and ſo much as he hath of Law, ſo much of a <hi>King;</hi> and in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteſt diſtance from Law and Reaſon, he is a Tyrant. 3. <hi>Abſtracta concretis ſunt puriora &amp; perfectiora.</hi> Iuſtice is perfecter then a juſt man, Whitenes perfecter then the white wall: ſo the neerer the <hi>King</hi> comes to a Law, for the which he is a <hi>King,</hi> the neerer to a <hi>King; Propter quod unumquodque tale, id ipſum magis tale.</hi> Therefore Kings throwing lawes to themſelves, as men, whereas they ſhould have conformed themſelves to the Law, have erred. <hi>Cambyſes</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> becauſe he loved his own ſiſter, would have <hi>the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the brother with the ſiſter, lawfull.

               <p>2. A Prerogative Royall muſt be a power of doing good to the people, and grounded upon ſome reaſon or law: but this is but a branch of an ordinarie limited power, and no prerogative above or beſide law. Yea, any power not grounded on a reaſon different from meere will or abſolute pleaſure, is an irrationall and brutiſh power; and therefore it may well be <hi>jus perſonae,</hi> the power of the<note place="margin">Jus perſonae, jus corouae.</note> man who is <hi>King;</hi> it cannot be <hi>jus coronae,</hi> any power annexed to the Crown: for this holdeth true of all the actions of a <hi>King,</hi> as a <hi>King. Illud poteſt Rex, &amp; illud tantum quod jure poteſt.</hi> The <hi>King,</hi> as <hi>King,</hi> can doe no more, then that which upon right and law he may doe.</p>

Thoſe who hold ſuch a Prerogative, muſt ſay, the King is ſo abſolute and illimited a <hi>God</hi> on earth, that either by law, or his ſole pleaſure beſide law, he may regularly and rationally move all wheeles in Policie; and his uncontrolled will ſhall be the axeltree on which all the wheeles are turned.</p>

But to doe Royall acts out of an abſolute power above Law and Reaſon, is ſuch a power as agreeth to <hi>God,</hi> as is evident in poſitive lawes, and in acts of Gods meere pleaſure, where we ſee no reaſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Almightie, for the one ſide, rather than for the other; as Gods forbidding the <hi>eating of the tree of knowledge,</hi> maketh the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſinne, and contrary to reaſon; but there is no reaſon in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:<note place="margin">Acts founded upon the ſole<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For when there

is no law in the object, but only <hi>Gods will,</hi> the act is good and wiſe, ſeeing infinite wiſdome cannot be ſeparated from the perfect will of <hi>God:</hi> but no act of a mortall King, having ſole and only will, and neither law nor reaſon in it, can be a lawfull, a wiſe, or a good act.</p>

                  <hi>Aſſert.</hi> 2. There is ſomething which may be called a Prerogative<note place="margin">A threefold diſpenſation.</note> by way of diſpenſation. There is a threefold diſpenſation; one of power, another of juſtice, and a third of grace. A diſpenſation of power, is, when the will of the Law-giver maketh that act to be no ſinne, which without that will would have been ſinne: As if <hi>Gods</hi> commanding Will had not interveened, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eare-rings and jewels of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and not reſtoring them, had been a breach of the 8 Commandement: and in this ſenſe no <hi>King</hi> hath a Prerogative to diſpence with a Law.</p>
               <p>2. There is a diſpenſation of law and juſtice, not flowing from<note place="margin">A diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 1. of ſole pleaſure, 2. of juſtice, 3. of grace.</note> any Prerogative, but from the true intent of the Law. And thus the <hi>King,</hi> yea the inferiour Judge, is not to take the life of a man, whom the letter of the Law would condemne; becauſe the Juſtice of the Law, is the intent and life of the Law: and where nothing is done againſt the intent of the Law, there is no breach of any Law.</p>
               <p>The Third is not unlike unto the Second, when the <hi>King</hi> expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth<note place="margin">A twofold ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poning of the Law by grace.</note> the Law by Grace: and this is twofold; 1. Either when he exponeth it of his wiſdome and mercifull nature, inclined to mercy and juſtice; yet according to the juſt intent, native ſenſe and ſcope of the Law, conſidering the occaſion, circumſtances of the fact, and comparing both with the Law: aud this diſpenſation of grace I grant to the <hi>King;</hi> As when the tribute is great, and the man poor,<note place="margin">In re dubia poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunt diſpenſare Principes, quia nullus ſenſus preſumitur, qui vincat princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palem, l. 1. Sect. initium ib.</note> the <hi>King</hi> may diſpenſe with the <hi>cuſtome.</hi> 2. The <hi>Law</hi> ſaith, In a doubtfull caſe the Prince may diſpenſe, becauſe it is preſumed, the Law can have no ſenſe againſt the principall ſenſe and intent of the Law.</p>
               <p>But there is another diſpenſation that Royaliſts doe plead for, and that is, a power in the King, <hi>ex mera gratia abſolutae poteſtatis regalis;</hi> Out of meere grace of abſolute Royall power, to pardon crimes, which Gods law ſaith, ſhould be puniſhed by death. Now this they call a power of Grace; but it is not a power of meere Grace.</p>
               <p>But, 1. Though Princes may doe ſome things of Grace, yet not of meere Grace: becauſe, what <hi>Kings</hi> doe, as <hi>Kings,</hi> and by vertue
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:119219:120"/>
of their Royall office, that they do <hi>ex debito officii,</hi> by debt and right<note place="margin">Kings, as Kings, cannot doe things of meere grace, becauſe they muſt doe all <hi>ex debito officii,</hi> by neceſſitie of their office.</note> of their office; and that they cannot but do, it not being arbitrarie to them to doe the debtfull acts of their office: But what they doe of <hi>meere grace,</hi> that they doe as good men, and not as <hi>Kings:</hi> and that they may not doe. As for example: Some Kings, out of their pretended prerogative, have given foure pardons to one man, for foure murthers: Now this the <hi>King</hi> might have left undone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinne; But of meere grace he pardoned the murtherer, who killed foure men. But the truth is, the <hi>King</hi> killed the three laſt; becauſe he hath no power in point of Conſcience, to diſpute with blood, <hi>Num. 35. 31. Gen.</hi> 9. 6. Theſe pardons are acts of meere grace to one man; but acts of blood to the Communitie.</p>
               <p>2. Becauſe the Prince is the <hi>Miniſter of God for the good of the ſubject;</hi> and therefore the Law ſaith, <hi>He cannot pardon, and free the guilty, of the puniſhment due to him. Contra l. quod favore, F. de leg. l. non ideo minus. F. de proc. l. legata inutiliter. F. de lega.</hi> 1.

I beleeve <hi>Ieremiah</hi> commanded not abſolute ſubjection in this ſence. But the contrary, <hi>Ier.</hi> 10. v. 11. They were to ſweare the Oath in the point of ſuffering; but what if the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Chaldea</hi> had commanded them all, the whole holy Seed, men, women and children, out of his Royall power, to give their neckes all in one day to his ſword, were they obliged by this Oath to prayers and teares, and only to ſuffer? and was it againſt the Oath of God to defend themſelves by Armes? I beleeve the Oath did not oblige to ſuch abſolute ſubjection, and though they had taken Armes in their owne lawfull defence, according to the Law of Nature, they had not broken the Oath of God. The Oath was not a tye to an abſolute ſubjection of all and every one, either to worſhip Idols, or then to fly, or ſuffer death. Now the Service-booke commanded in the Kings abſolute authority all <hi>Scotland</hi> to commit groſſer Idolatry, in the intention of the work, if not in the intention of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, then was in <hi>Babylon.</hi> (We read not that the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> preſſed the conſciences of Gods people to Idolatry) or that all ſhould either fly the Kingdome, and leave their inheritances to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> and <hi>Prelates,</hi> or then come under the mercy of the ſword of <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts</hi> by ſea or land. 3. <hi>God</hi> may command againſt the Law of Nature; and <hi>Gods</hi> Commandement maketh ſubjection lawfull; ſo as men may not now, being under that Law of God, defend themſelves. What then? <hi>Ergo</hi> we owe ſubjection to abſolute Princes, and their power muſt be a lawfull power, it no waies is conſequent. Gods Commandement by <hi>Ieremiah</hi> made the ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Iudah lawfull, and without that Commandement they might have taken Armes againſt the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> as they did againſt the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and Gods Commandement maketh the Oath law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.

God formeth Being, and morall Aptitude to the end in all Laws, to wit, the ſafetie of the people; and the Kings will is neither the meaſure, nor the cauſe of the goodneſſe of things.</p>
               <p>2. If the King be he who maketh the Law good and juſt, becauſe he is more ſuch himſelf, then as the Law cannot crook, and erre, nor ſin; neither can the King ſin, nor break a Law. This is blaſphemy, Every man is a lyer; a Law which deſerveth the name of a Law, cannot lie.</p>
               <p>3. His ground is, <hi>That there is ſuch majeſty in Kings, that their</hi>

Nor can it be made good, that the <hi>King</hi> only hath<note place="margin">The King hath no Nomothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick power, his alone.</note> power of making Lawes; becauſe his power were then abſolute, to inflict penalties on Subjects, without any conſent of theirs; and that were a dominion of Maſters, who command what they pleaſe, and under what paine they pleaſe. And the people conſenting to be ruled by ſuch a man, they tacitely conſent to penaltie of laws, becauſe naturall reaſon ſaith, <hi>An ill-doer ſhould be puniſhed. Florianus in l. inde.

               <p>2. <hi>Jer.</hi> 26. It is cleare, The Princes judge with the people: A nomothetick power differeth gradually only from a judiciall power, both being collarerall meanes to the end of Government, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſafetie. But Parliaments judge, <hi>ergo,</hi> they have a nomothetick power with the King.</p>
               <p>3. The Parliament giveth all ſupremacie to the King; <hi>ergo,</hi> to prevent Tyrannie, it muſt keep a coordinate power with the King, in the higheſt acts.</p>
               <p>4. If the Kingly line be interrupted, if the King be a Childe, or a Captive, they make Lawes, who make Kings; <hi>Ergo,</hi> this nomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetick power recurreth into the States, as to the firſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> The King is the fountaine of the law, and Subjects cannot<note place="margin">

The <hi>King</hi> is the only Supreme, in the power miniſteriall of executing lawes: but this is a derived power, ſo as no one man is above him; but in the fountaine-power of Royaltie, the States are above him.</p>

By Anti-Monarchiſts; The people at the beginning were neceſſitated to commit themſelves, lives and fortunes to the government of a King, becauſe of themſelves they had not wiſedome and power enough to doe it: and therefore they enabled him with honour and power, without which he could not doe this, being aſſured that he could not chooſe but moſt earneſtly and carefully endeavour this end, to wit, his own, and the peoples happines. Ergo, the ſafetie of the people iſſueth from the ſafetie of the King, as the life of the naturall body from the ſoule. Weake Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is neare to Anarchie. Puritans will not ſay, <hi>Quovis modo eſſe, etiam poenale,</hi> is better then <hi>non eſſe:</hi> The Scripture ſaith the contrary; It were better for ſome never to have been borne, then to be. Tyranny is better then no Government.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. He knowes not Sophiſmes of Logick, who calleth this Argument, à <hi>diviſis:</hi> for the <hi>Kings</hi> Honour is not the end of the <hi>Kings</hi> Government: He ſhould ſeeke the ſafetie of State and Church, not himſelf; Himſelfe is a private end, and a ſtep to <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Prelate</hi> lyeth, when he maketh us to <hi>reaſon from the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Subject to the deſtruction of the King. Ferne, Barclay, Groti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> taught the hungry Scholler to reaſon ſo. Where read he this? The People muſt be ſaved; That is the Supreme law: <hi>Ergo,</hi> deſtroy the <hi>King.</hi> The Devill and the <hi>Prelate</hi> both, ſhall not faſten this on us. But thus we reaſon: When the man who is the King, endeavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not the end of his Royall place, but, through bad counſell, the ſubverſion of Lawes, Religion, and bondage of the Kingdome; The free Eſtates are to joyne with him for that end of Safetie, according as God hath made them heads of Tribes, and Princes of the people: And if the King refuſe to joyne with them, and will not doe his dutie; I ſee not how they are in conſcience liberated, before God, from doing their part.</p>
               <p>3. If the <hi>P. Prelate</hi> call reſiſting the <hi>King</hi> by lawfull defenſive wars, the deſtruction of the Head; He ſpeaketh with the mouth of one excommunicated, and delivered up to <hi>Sathan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. We endeavour nothing more then the ſafetie and happineſſe
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:119219:133"/>
of the King, as King: but his happineſſe is not to ſuffer him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy his Subjects, ſubvert Religion, arme Papiſts, who have ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered above two hundred thouſand innocent Proteſtants, only for the profeſſion of that true Religion which the King hath ſworne to maintaine. Not to riſe in armes to helpe the King againſt theſe, were to gratifie him as a Man, but to be acceſſarie to his ſoules deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as a King.</p>
               <p>5. That the Royall Prerogative is the end of a Monarchie ordained by God; neither Scripture, Law, nor Reaſon can admit.</p>
               <p>6. The people are to intend the ſafetie of other Iudges, as well as the Kings. If <hi>Parliaments</hi> be deſtroyed, whoſe it is to make Lawes and Kings; the People can neither beſafe, free to ſerve <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor happy.</p>
               <p>7. It is a lie, that people were neceſſitated, at the beginning, to commit themſelves to a <hi>King:</hi> for we read of no King, while <hi>Nimrod</hi> aroſe: Fathers of families (who were not Kings) and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, did governe till then.</p>
               <p>8. It was not want of wiſedome, (for in many, and in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, there muſt be more wiſdome then in one man:) but rather cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of nature, and reciprocation of injuries, that created Kings, and other Iudges.</p>
               <p>9. The King ſhall better compaſſe his end, to wit, the ſafetie of the people, with limited power, (<hi>placent mediocria</hi>) and with other Iudges added to helpe him, <hi>Num.</hi> 11. 14, 16. <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 12, 13, 14, 15. then to put in one mans hand abſolute power: for a ſinfull mans head cannot beare ſo much new wine, ſuch as exorbitant pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is.</p>
               <p>10. He is a baſe flatterer, who ſaith, The King <hi>cannot chooſe but earneſtly and carefully endeavour his own, and the peoples happineſſe:</hi> that is, the King is an <hi>Angel,</hi> and cannot ſinne, and decline from the duties of a King. Of the many Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny choſe this? All the good Kings that have been, may be written in a gold ring.</p>
               <p>11. The peoples ſafetie dependeth indeed on the King, as a King and a happy Governour; but the people ſhall never be fattened to eat the winde of an imaginarie Prerogative Royall.</p>
               <p>12. Weake Government, that is, a <hi>King</hi> with a limited power, who hath more power about his head, nor within his head; is a
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:119219:134"/>
ſtrong King, and farre from Anarchy.</p>
               <p>13. I know not what he meaneth, but <hi>Arminius,</hi> his Maſters<note place="margin">Iac. Armini. Declar. Remonſtrant. in ſuod. dordrac.</note> way and words are here, for <hi>Arminians</hi> ſay, <hi>That being in the damned eternally tormented is no benefit, it were better they never had being, then to be eternally tormented;</hi> and this they ſay to the defiance of the Doctrine of eternall Reprobation, in which we teach, That though by accident, and becauſe of the Damned their abuſe of being and life, it were to them better not to be; as is ſaid of <hi>Iudas,</hi> yet <hi>ſimpliciter</hi> comparing being with non-being, and conſidering the eternity of miſerable being in relation to the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute liberty of the Former of all things, who maketh uſe of the ſinfull being of Clay-veſſells for the illuſtration of the glory of his Iuſtice and power, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 17, 22. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>Iude</hi> v. 4. It is a cenſuring of God, and his unſearchable Wiſedome, and a condemning of the Almighty of cruelty (<hi>God</hi> avert blaſphemy of the unſpotted and holy Majeſty) who by Arminian grounds, keepeth the Damned in life, and being to be fuell eternally for <hi>Tophet,</hi> to declare the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Iuſtice. But the Prelate behoved to goe out of his way to ſalute and gratifie, a proclaimed enemy of free Grace <hi>Arminius,</hi> and hence he would inferre, That the King wanting his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Royall, and fulneſſe of abſolute power to doe wickedly, is in a penall and miſerable condition, and that it were better for the <hi>King</hi> to be a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> with abſolute liberty to deſtroy, and ſave alive at his pleaſure, as is ſaid of a Tyrant, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. v. 19. then to be no King at all. And here conſider a Principle of Royaliſts Court faith.</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>King</hi> is no <hi>King,</hi> but a lame and miſerable Iudge, if he<note place="margin">The Royaliſts principles drive at this, to make none Kings but only rank Tyrants.</note> have not irreſiſtable power to waſt and deſtroy.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>King</hi> cannot be happy, nor the people ſafe; nor can the King doe good in ſaving the needy, except he have the uncontrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable and unlimited power of a Tyrant, to cruſh the poore and needy, and lay waſt the mountaine of the Lords inheritance: ſuch Court-ravens, who feede upon the ſoules of living Kings, are more cruell then Ravens and Vultures, who are but dead carcaſſes.</p>

               <p>2. The flatterer may know, there be more fooliſh Kings in the world then wiſe, and that Kings miſled with Idolatrous <hi>Queenes,</hi> and by name <hi>Achab</hi> ruined himſelfe, and his poſterity and Kingdome.</p>
               <p>3. The ſalvation and happineſſe of men ſtanding in the exalting of Chriſts Throne and the Goſpell, <hi>ergo</hi> every King, and every man will exalt the Throne, and ſo let them have an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollable power without conſtraint of Law, to doe what they liſt, and let no bounds be ſet to Kings over ſubjects; by this Argument their owne wiſedome is a law to leade them to Heaven.</p>
               <p>4. It is not <hi>Abſoloms</hi> mad Male-contents in <hi>Britane,</hi> but there were really no juſtice to Proteſtants, all indulgence to Papiſts, Popery, Arminianiſme, Idolatry printed, Preached, profeſſed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded by Authority, Parliaments, and Church Aſſemblies, the Bulwarkes of Iuſtice and Religion were denyed, diſſolved, cruſhed, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>5. That by a King he underſtandeth a <hi>Monarch,</hi> Iudg. 17. and that ſuch a one, as <hi>Saul,</hi> of <hi>Abſolute power,</hi> and not a Iudge, cannot be proved, for there were no Kings in Iſrael in the Iudges daies, the Government not being changed till neare the end of <hi>Samuels</hi> Government.</p>
               <p>6. And that they had no Iudges, he ſaith, It is not imaginable, but I rather beleeve God then the Prelate, <hi>Every one did what was
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:119219:135"/>
right in his owne eyes,</hi> becauſe there was none to put ill doers to ſhame. Poſſible the Eſtates of Iſrael governed ſome way for meere neceſſity, but wanting a ſupreme Iudge which they ſhould have, they were looſe: but this was not becauſe where there is no King, as <hi>P. P.</hi> would inſinuate, there was no Government, as is cleare.</p>
               <p>7. Of tempered and limited Monarchy, I thinke as honourably as the Prelate, but that abſolute and unlimited Monarchy is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenter then Ariſtocracy, I ſhall then beleeve when <hi>Royaliſts</hi> ſhall prove ſuch a Government, in ſo farre it is abſolute, to be of God.</p>
               <p>8. That <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> was now weakened I beleeve not, ſeeing God ſo highly commendeth it, and calleth it his own <hi>reigning over his people,</hi> 1 Sam. 8. 7. The weakening of it through abuſe, is not to a purpoſe, more then the abuſe of <hi>Monarchy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. <hi>No doubt</hi> (ſaith he) Hoſ. 4. <hi>They were Prieſts and Iudges,</hi> Hoſ. 4. <hi>but they were over-awed as they are now. J thinke he</hi> would ſay, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3. 4. otherwiſe he citeth Scripture ſleeping. That the Prieſts of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> be not only over-awed, but out of the earth; I yeeld, that the <hi>King</hi> be limited, not over-awed, I thinke Gods Law, and mans Law alloweth.</p>
               <p>10. The ſafety of the <hi>King</hi> as <hi>King,</hi> is not only ſafety, but a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to Church and State, and therefore this <hi>P. Prelate</hi> and his fellowes deſerve to be hanged before the Sun, who have led him on a warre to deſtroy him, and his Proteſtant ſubjects. But the ſafety and flouriſhing of a King in the exerciſes of an Arbitrary, unlimited power againſt Law, and Religion, and to the deſtruction of his ſubjects, is not the ſafety of the people, nor the ſafety of the <hi>Kings</hi> ſoule, which theſe men, if they be the Prieſts of the Lord, ſhould care for.</p>
               <p>The Prelate commeth to refute the learned and worthy Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.<note place="margin">Sacr. ſan. Mai. pag. 165.</note> 
                  <hi>The ſafety of the people is the ſupreme Law,</hi> ergo <hi>the King is bound in duty to promote all and every one of his ſubjects to all happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> The <hi>Obſervator</hi> hath no ſuch inference, the King is bound to promote ſome of his ſubjects even as King, to a Gallowes, eſpecially <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebells, and many bloudy Malignants. But the Prelate will needs have <hi>God</hi> rigorous (hallowed be his name) if it be ſo, for it is unpoſſible to the tendereſt-hearted father to doe ſo: actuall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of all is unpoſſible, that the King intend it of all his ſubjects,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:119219:135"/>
as good ſubjects, by a Throne eſtabliſhed on righteouſneſſe and judgement, is that which the <hi>worthy Obſervator</hi> meaneth; other things here are anſwered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſumme of his ſecond anſwer is, a repetition of what he hath ſaid; I give my word in a</hi> Pamphlet <hi>of one hundred ninety and foure pages, I never ſaw more idle repetitions, of one thing twenty times before ſaid. But page one hundred ſixty and eight, he ſaith,</hi> The ſafety of the King and his ſubjects in the Morall notion may be eſteemed Morally the ſame, no leſſe then the ſoule and the body make one perſonall ſubſiſtence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is ſtrange Logick, the <hi>King</hi> and his ſubjects are <hi>Ens por aggregationem;</hi> and the King as King hath one Morall ſubſiſtence, and the people another. Hath the Father and the ſonne, the Maſter and the ſervant one Morall ſubſiſtence? but the man ſpeaketh of their well being: and then he muſt meane that our Kings Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was not long agoe, and is yet, to wit, the Popery, Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſme, Idolatry, cutting of mens eares, and noſes, baniſhing, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, for ſpeaking againſt Popery, arming of Papiſts to ſlay Proteſtants, pardoning the bloud of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that I feare, ſhall not be ſoone taken away, &amp;c. are identically the ſame with the life, ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and happineſſe of Proteſtants, then life and death, juſtice and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, Idolatry and ſincere worſhip are identically one, as the ſoule of the Prelate and his body are one.</p>
               <p>The third is but a repitition. <hi>The Acts of Royaltie (ſaith the</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervator)<note place="margin">The ſubjects may gratifie the King for doing what he is obliged to doe by his office.</note>

What fathers do to children, are acts of naturall dutie, and of naturall grace; and yet children owe grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to parents, and ſubjects to good Kings, in a legall ſenſe. No, but in way of courteſie onely. The <hi>Obſervator</hi> ſaid, The King is not a father to the whole collective body, and its well ſaid, he is ſon to them, and they his maker. Who made the King? Policy anſwereth, The State made him, and Divinitie: God made him.</p>
               <p>4. The <hi>Obſervator</hi> ſaid well: The peoples weakneſſe is not the<note place="margin">Sac. ſacr. Mai. pag. 170.</note> Kings ſtrength.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> True indeed, If the King had Royalty by immediate truſt, and infuſion by God, as <hi>Elias</hi> had the ſpirit of prophecie, that he cannot make away: Royaliſts dream that God immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from heaven, now infuſeth facultie and right to Crowns, without any word of God. Its enough to make an <hi>Euthyſiaſt</hi> leap up to the Throne, and kill Kings. Judge if theſe Fanaticks be favourers of Kings: But if the King have Royaltie mediately by the peoples free conſent from God, there is no reaſon, but people give as much power even by ounce weights (for power is ſtrong Wine, and a great mocker) as they know a weak mans head will bear, and no more; power is not an immediate inheritance from heaven: But a birth-right of the people borrowed from them, they may ſet it out for their good, and reſume it when a man is drunk with it. 2. The man will have it conſcience on the King to fight and deſtroy his three Kingdoms, for a dream, his prerogative above Law. But the truth is, <hi>Prelates</hi> do engage the King, his houſe, honour, ſubjects, Church, for their curſed Mytres.</p>

He is to ſtand upon tranſgreſſion of Lawes according to their genuine ſenſe of the peoples ſafety, for good Lawes are not contrary one to another, though when he breaketh through the letter to the Law, yet he breaketh not the Law, for if twenty thouſand Rebells invade <hi>Scotland,</hi> he is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all to riſe, though the formality of a Parliament cannot be had to indict the war, as our Law provideth; but the King doth not command all to riſe, and defend themſelves by a Prerogative Royall, proper to him as King, and incommunicable to any but to himſelfe.</p>
               <p>1. There is no ſuch dinne and noiſe to be made for a King, and his incommunicable Prerogative, for though the King were not at all, yea though he command the contrary (as he did when he came
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:119219:137"/>
againſt <hi>Scotland</hi> with an Engliſh Army) the law of Nature teacheth all to riſe without the King.</p>
               <p>2. That the King command this as King, it is not a particular po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Law; but he doth it as a man, and a member of the Kingdom; The law of Nature, (which knoweth no dreame of ſuch a Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive) forceth him to it, as every member is, by Natures indictment, to care for the whole.</p>
               <p>3. It is poore hungry skill in this New Statiſt, (for ſo he nameth all <hi>Scotland</hi>) to ſay, that <hi>any Lawes are made for private intereſts,</hi>

               <p>2. Prerogative is either a power to doe good, or ill, or both: If the firſt be ſaid, it muſt be limited by the End, and Law, for which it is ordained. A meane is no farther a meane, but in ſo far as it conduceth to the end; the ſafetie of all. If the ſecond be admitted, It is Licence and Tyrannie, not power from <hi>God.</hi> If the third be ſaid, both reaſons plead againſt this, that Prerogative ſhould be the Kings end in the preſent warres.</p>
               <p>3. Prerogative being a power given by the mediation of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; yea, ſuppoſe (which is falſe) that it were given immediately of <hi>God;</hi> yet it not a thing for which the <hi>King</hi> ſhould raiſe war againſt his Subjects: for God will aske no more of the <hi>King,</hi> then he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to him: <hi>The Lord reapeth not, where he ſoweth not.</hi> If the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia,</hi>

The King cannot anſwer to God for the juſtice of warre on his part: It is not a caſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience that the King ſhould ſhed blood for, to wit, becauſe the under-Officers are ſuch men, and not others of his chooſing; ſeeing the Kingdome is defended ſufficiently, except where Cavaliers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it. And to me, this is an unanſwerable argument, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers deſtroy not the Kingdomes for this Prerogative Royall, as the principall ground; but for a deeper deſigne, even for that which was working by Prelates and Malignants, before the late trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in both Kingdomes.</p>
               <p>4. The <hi>King</hi> is to intend the ſafetie of his People; and the ſafety of the <hi>King,</hi> as a Governour, but not as this <hi>King,</hi> and this man, <hi>Charles:</hi> that is a ſelfe end: a King <hi>David</hi> is not to looke to that: for when the people was ſeeking his life and crown, he ſaith, <hi>Pſ. 3. 8.

               <p>2. It is by Law, that amongſt many hundred men, this man is King, not this man; and becauſe, <hi>by the which a thing is conſtituted, by the ſame thing it is, or may be diſſolved;</hi> therefore,</p>
               <p>3. As a Community finding ſuch and ſuch qualifications as the Law requireth to be in a King, in this man, not in this man; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon Law-ground,</p>
               <p>5. They make him a King, and upon Law-grounds and juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit, they may unmake him again; for, <hi>what men voluntarily doe upon condition, the condition being removed, they may undoe again.</hi>

                  <hi>hath to ſay;</hi> 1. They ſay (<hi>he meaneth the</hi> Jeſuites) Every ſocietie of men is a perfect Republick, and ſo muſt have within it ſelfe a power to preſerve it ſelfe from ruine, and by that to puniſh a Tyrant. <hi>He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth,</hi> A ſocietie without a Head, is a diſorderly rout, not a Politique body; and ſo cannot have this power.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The Pope giveth to every Societie, Politick power to make away a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> or hereticall King, and to un-king him, by his brethren the Jeſuites way. And obſerve, how Papiſts (of which number I could eaſily prove the <hi>P. Prelate</hi> to be, by the Popiſh doctrine that he delivered, while the iniquitie of time, and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Prelates in <hi>Scotland,</hi> advanced him, againſt all worth of true learning and holineſſe, to be a Preacher in <hi>Edinborough</hi>) and <hi>Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites</hi> agree, as the builders of <hi>Babylon.</hi> It is the purpoſe of <hi>God</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. This anſwer ſhall inferre, that the <hi>Ariſtocraticall</hi> Governors of any free State, and that the Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> and the Senate there, is above all Law, and cannot be reſiſted, becauſe without their Heads they are a diſorderly Rout.</p>
               <p>3. A Politicall ſocietie, as by Natures inſtinct, they may appoint a Head, or Heads to themſelves: ſo alſo if their Head, or Heads become ravenous Wolves, the <hi>God</hi> of Nature hath not left a perfect Societie remedileſſe; but they may both reſiſt, and puniſh the Head or Heads, to whom they gave all the power that they have, for their good, not for their deſtruction.</p>
               <p>4. They are as orderly a body Politique, to unmake a Tyrannous Commander, as they were to make a juſt Governonr. The <hi>Prelate</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is alike to conceive a Politique body without a Governour, as to conceive the naturall body without a Head.</hi> He meaneth, None of them can be conceivable. I am not of his minde. When <hi>Saul</hi> was dead, Iſrael was a perfect Politique body: and the <hi>Prelate,</hi> if he be not very obtuſe in his head, (as this hungry peece ſtollen from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſheweth him to be) may conceive a viſible Politicall ſocietie performing a Politicall action, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3. making <hi>David</hi> King
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:119219:142"/>
at a viſible and conceivable place, at <hi>Hebron;</hi> and making a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him. And that they wanted not all Governors, is nothing to make them Chymera's unconceivable: For when ſo many fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies before <hi>Nimrod,</hi> were governed only by fathers of families, and they agreed to make either a King, or other Governors, a Head, or Heads over themſelves: though the ſeverall families had govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet theſe conſociated families had no government; and yet ſo conceivable a Politique body, as if <hi>Maxwell</hi> would have compeared amongſt them, and called them a <hi>diſorderly rout,</hi> or an unconceivable <hi>Chymera,</hi> they ſhould have made the Prelate know, that <hi>Chymera's</hi> can knock down <hi>Prelates.</hi> Neither is a <hi>King</hi> the <hi>life of a Politique body, as the ſoule is of the naturall body:</hi> The body createth not the ſoule: but Iſrael created <hi>Saul</hi> King; and when he was dead, they made <hi>David</hi> King, and ſo, under <hi>God,</hi> many <hi>Kings,</hi> as they ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, till the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> came. No naturall body can make ſoules to it ſelfe by ſucceſſion; Nor can Seas create new <hi>Prelates</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes.</p>

Some will have it in a collective body, but how? not met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by warrant, or writ of Soveraigne Authoritie, but when fancie of reforming Church and State calleth them. Some will have the power in the Nobles and Peeres; ſome in the three Eſtates aſſembled by the Kings Writ; ſome in the inferior Iudges. I know not where this power to curbe Soveraigntie is, but in Almighty God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ. 1. Ieſuites</hi> and <hi>Puritans</hi> differ infinitely: true. Jeſuites deny the Pope to be Antichriſt, hold all Arminian doctrine, Chriſts locall deſcenſion to hell: all which the Prelate did preach. We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny all this.</p>

Kings can ſin againſt none, but thoſe who have power to judge and puniſh them; but God only, and no inferiours, and no ſubjects have power to puniſh the Kings, therefore Kings can ſin againſt none of their ſubjects, and where there is no ſin, how can there be a Law? neither <hi>Major</hi> or <hi>Minor</hi> can be denyed by <hi>Royaliſts.</hi>

               <p>3. He will excuſe <hi>Nero</hi> as of infirmity, wiſhing all <hi>Rome to have one necke,</hi> that he may cut it off. And is that charitable of Kings, that they <hi>will not be ſo mad as to deſtroy their owne Kingdome?</hi> But when Stories teach us there have been more Tyrants then Kings, the Kings are more obliged to him for flattery, then for State-wit, except we ſay that all Kings <hi>who cate the people of God, as they doe bread,</hi> owe him little, for making them all madde and franticke.</p>
               <p>4. But let them be <hi>Nero's,</hi> and madde, and worſe, there is no coercing of them, but all muſt give their neckes to the ſword, if the poore Prelate be heard; and yet Kings cannot be ſo madde as to deſtroy their ſubjects. <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>England</hi> was that madde, the Romiſh Princes who have given, Revel. 17. 13. <hi>their power and ſtrength to the beaſt, and doe make warre with the Lambe;</hi> and Kings inſpired with the ſpirit of the beaſt, and drunke with the wine of the <hi>Cup of Babells fornications,</hi> are ſo madde, and the <hi>ten Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi> are ſo madde, who waſted their faithfulleſt ſubjects.</p>

I can prove a power in the King, limited onely to feed, governe, and ſave the people; and you affirme that <hi>God</hi> hath given to the <hi>King,</hi> not only a power officiall and Royall to ſave, but alſo to deſtroy and cut off, ſo as no man may ſay, <hi>Why doeſt thou this?</hi> Shall we take this upon the word of an excommunicated Prelate? <hi>Profer tabulas, Iohn P.

from <hi>God:</hi> Let <hi>John P. P.</hi> prove a power to doe ill, given of <hi>God</hi> to the King.</p>
               <p>2. We ſhall quickly prove that the States may repreſſe this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and puniſh the Tyrant, not the King: when he ſhall prove that a <hi>Tyrannous power</hi> is an Ordinance of <hi>God,</hi> and ſo may not be reſiſted. For the law of Nature teacheth, If I give my ſword to my fellow to defend me from the murtherer, if he ſhall fall to, and murther me with my own ſword, I may (if I have ſtrength) take my ſword from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prelate.</hi> It is infidelitie, to thinke that God cannot helpe us; and impatience, that we will not wait on God. When a King oppreſſeth us, it is againſt Gods wiſdome, that he hath not provided another meane for our ſafetie, than intruſion on Gods right. 2. It is againſt Gods power, 3. his Holineſſe, 4. Chriſtian Religion, that we neceſſitate God to ſo weake a meane, to make uſe of ſinne: and we caſt the aſperſion of Treaſon on Religion, and deterre Kings to profeſſe Reformed Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Religion. 5. We are not to juſtle God out of his right.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I ſee nothing but what <hi>D. Ferne, Grotius, Barclay, Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> have ſaid before, with ſome colour of proving the conſequence. The <hi>P. Prelate</hi> giveth us other mens arguments, but without bones, All were good, if the States coercing and curbing a power which God never gave to the King, were a ſinne, and an act of impatience, and unbelief: And, if it were proper to God only, by his immediate hand, to coerce Tyrannie.</p>
               <p>2. He calleth it not Proteſtant Religion, either here, or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; but cautelouſly giveth a name that will agree to the <hi>Roman Catholique Religion:</hi> For the <hi>Dominicans, Franciſcans,</hi> and the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſian Doctors</hi> and <hi>Schoolemen,</hi> following <hi>Occham, Gerſon, Almain,</hi> and other Papiſts, call themſelves <hi>Reformed Catholiques.</hi> 2. He lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this for a ground, in 3 or 4 pages, where theſe ſame Arguments are againe and againe repeated <hi>in terminis,</hi> as his ſecond Reaſon, p. 149. was handled <hi>ad nauſeam,</hi> p. 148. his 3. Reaſon is repeated in his 6. Reaſon, p. 151. He layeth (I ſay) down this ground, which is the begged Concluſion, and maketh the Concluſion the Aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in 8 raw and often repeated Arguments: to wit, <hi>That the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments coercing and reſtraining of Arbitrarie power, is rebellion, and reſiſting the Ordinance of God.</hi> But he dare not looke the place <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. on the face: other Royaliſts have done it with bad ſucceſſe.

                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:119219:145"/>
But it is indeed the triviall Argument of all <hi>Royaliſts,</hi> eſpecially of <hi>Barclay,</hi> obvious in his 3. Booke. If Arbitrarie and Tyrannicall power above any Law that the lawfull Magiſtrate commandeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the paine of death, (<hi>Thou ſhalt not murther one man) (Thou ſhalt not take away the vineyard of one Naboth violently</hi>) be lawfull and warrantable by Gods word; then an Arbitrarie power above all Divine lawes, is given to the keeping of the Civill Magiſtrate. And it is no leſſe lawfull Arbitrarie, or rather Tyrannicall power, for <hi>David</hi> to kill all his Subjects, and to plunder all <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (as I beleeve, Prelates, and Malignants, and Papiſts would ſerve the three Kingdomes, if the King ſhould command them) then to kill one <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> or for <hi>Achab</hi> to ſpoile one <hi>Naboth.</hi> The eſſence of ſinne muſt agree alike to all, though the degrees varie.</p>
               <p>Of <hi>Gods</hi> remedie againſt Arbitrary power, hereafter, in the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of Reſiſtance: but the confuſed ingine of the Prelate bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it in here, where there is no place for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His 7. Argument is:</hi> Before God would authorize Rebellion, and give a bad preſident thereof for ever, he would rather worke extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and wonderfull miracles, and therefore would not authorize the people to deliver themſelves from under <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> but made <hi>Moſes</hi>

But, I pray you, what is this Argument to the Queſtion in hand, which is, <hi>Whether the King be ſo above all Lawes, as People and Peeres, in the caſe of Arbitrarie power, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume their power, and puniſh a Tyrant?</hi> The <hi>P. Prelate</hi> draweth in the Queſtion of <hi>Reſiſtance</hi> by the haire. <hi>Iſraels</hi> not riſing in armes againſt <hi>K. Pharaoh,</hi> proveth nothing againſt the power of a Free Kingdome againſt a Tyrant.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Moſes,</hi> who wrought miracles deſtructive to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> might pray a vengeance againſt <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> God having revealed to <hi>Moſes,</hi> that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was a Reprobate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But may Miniſters and Nobles pray ſo againſt King <hi>Charles?</hi> God forbid.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had not his Crown from Iſrael.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:119219:146"/>3. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had not ſworne to defend Iſrael, nor became he their King upon condition he ſhould maintaine and profeſſe the Religion of the <hi>God of Iſrael:</hi> Therefore <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not, as free Eſtates, chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge him in their ſupreme Court of Parliament, of breach of oath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and upon no termes could they un-king <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> He held not his Crown of them.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was never circumciſed, nor within the <hi>Covenant of the God of Iſrdel,</hi> in profeſſion.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Iſrael</hi> had their lands by the meere gift of the King. I hope the <hi>King of Britaine</hi> ſtandeth to <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> in a foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold contrary relation.</p>
               <p>All Divines know, that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> his Princes, and the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> were his Peeres and People, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nd that <hi>Iſrael</hi> were not his native Subjects, but a number of ſtrangers, who by the lawes of the King and Princes, by the meanes of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> had gotten the land of <hi>Goſhen</hi> for their dwelling, and libertie to ſerve the <hi>God of Abraham,</hi> to whom they prayed in their bondage, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2. 23, 24. and they were not to ſerve the <hi>Gods of Egypt,</hi> nor were of the Kings Religion: And therefore his Argument is thus: <hi>A number of poore exiled ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers under King</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>who were not</hi> Pharaohs <hi>Princes and Peeres, could not reſtraine the Tyrannie of King</hi> Pharaoh: <hi>Ergo, the three Eſtates in a free Kingdome may not reſtraine the Arbitrarie power of a King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The Prelate muſt prove that <hi>God</hi> gave a Royall and Kingly power to <hi>King Pharaoh,</hi> due to him by vertue of his Kingly calling, (according as Royaliſts expone 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 9, 11.) to kill all the <hi>male children</hi> of Iſrael, to make <hi>ſlaves of themſelves, and compell them to worke in brick and clay, while their lives were a burden to them:</hi> And that if a Romiſh Catholique, <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> ſhould kill all the male Children of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> by the hands of Papiſts, at the Queenes commandement, and make bondſlaves of all the Peeres, Iudges, and three Eſtates, who made her a free Princeſſe: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that <hi>Mary</hi> had ſworne to maintaine the Proteſtant Religion; they were to ſuffer, and not to defend themſelves. But if <hi>God</hi> give <hi>Pharaoh</hi> a power to kill all Iſrael, ſo as they could not controll it; then <hi>God</hi> giveth to a <hi>King</hi> a Royall power by office to ſinne: only the <hi>Royaliſt</hi> ſaveth <hi>God</hi> from being the author of ſinne, in this, that <hi>God</hi> gave the power to ſinne, but yet with this limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>that the Subjects ſhould not reſiſt this power.</hi> 2. He muſt prove
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:119219:146"/>
that Iſrael was to give their Male-children to <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Butchers, for to hide them, was to reſiſt a Royall power, and to diſobey a Royall power given of God, is to diſobey God. 3. The Subjects may not reſiſt the Kings Butchers coming to kill them, and their Male-children, <hi>For to reſiſt the ſervant of the King in that, wherein he is a ſervant, is to reſiſt the King, 1 Sam. 8. 7. 1 Pet. 2. 14. Rom.</hi> 13. 1. 4. He muſt prove that upon the ſuppoſition, That Iſrael had been as ſtrong as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his people; that without Gods ſpeciall commandment (they then wanting the written Word) they ſhould have ſought with <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> and that we now for all wars, muſt have a word from Heaven, as if we had not Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Will in his Word, as at that time Iſrael behoved to have in all wars, <hi>Judg. 18. 5. 1 Sam. 14. 37.

But becauſe God gave not them an anſwer to fight againſt <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> therefore we have no warrant now to fight againſt a forraign Nation, invading us; the conſequence is null, and therefore this is a vain Argument, <hi>The Prophets never reprove the people for not performing the duty of defenſive wars againſt Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Kings.</hi> Ergo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>There is no ſuch dutie enjoyned by any Law of God to us;</hi> For the Prophets never rebuke the people for non-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the dutie of offenſive wars againſt their enemies; but where God gave a ſpeciall command, and reſponce, from his own <hi>Oracle,</hi> that they ſhould fight: And if God was pleaſed never to command the people to riſe againſt a Tyrannous King, they did not ſin where they had no commandment of God: but I hope we have now a more ſure word of prophecie to inform us. 5. The <hi>Prelate</hi> conjectureth <hi>Moſes</hi> his miraeles, and the deliverance of the people, by dividing the Red Sea, was to forbid, and condemn, defenſive wars of people againſt their King; but he hath neither Scripture, nor Reaſons to do it. The end of theſe miracles, was to Seal to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> the Truth of Gods calling of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> to deliver the people, as is clear, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. compared with <hi>Chap. 7. verſ.</hi> 8, 9, 10.

But this is not practiſed in Scripture: <hi>Ergo,</hi> It is not lawfull. It followeth it. Shew me in Scripture the killing of a Goaring On who killed a man; the not making battlements on an houſe; the putting to death of a man lying with a Beaſt; the killing of ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Prophets, who tempted the people to go a whoring, and ſerve another God, then <hi>Jehovah:</hi> I mean, a god made by the hand of the Baker, ſuch a one as the excommunicated Prelate is known to be, who hath Preached this Idolatry in three Kingdoms, yet <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.

               <p>THis Queſtion conduceth not a little to the clearing of the doubts concerning the Kings abſolute power, and the ſuppoſed ſole nomothetick power in the <hi>King.</hi> And I thinke it not unlike to the queſtion, whether the Pope and <hi>Romiſh Church have a ſole and peremptory power of exponing Lawes, and the Word of God?</hi> We are to conſider that there is a twofold expoſition of Lawes, one ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative in a Schoole way, ſo exquiſite <hi>Iuriſts</hi> have a power to expone<note place="margin">A twofold ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Lawes.</note> Lawes. 2.

               <p>For this Publicke, the Law hath one fundamentall rule, <hi>Salus po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puli,</hi> like the King of Planets the Sunne, which lendeth Star-light to all Lawes, and by which they are exponed; whatever interpretation ſwarveth either from fundamentall Lawes of policy, or from the Law of Nature, and the Law of Nations, and eſpecially from the<note place="margin">A Rule to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone Lawes.</note> ſafety of the publick, is to be rejected as a perverting of the Law: and therefore, <hi>Conſcientia humani generis, the naturall conſcience of all men, to which</hi> the oppreſſed people may appeale unto, when the <hi>King</hi> exponeth a Law unjuſtly, at his owne pleaſure, is the laſt rule on earth, for exponing of Lawes. Nor ought Lawes to be made ſo obſcure, as an ordinary wit cannot ſee their connexion with funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall truths of policy, and the ſafety of the people, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſee no inconvenience, to ſay that, The Law it ſelfe is <hi>Norma &amp; regula judicandi,</hi> the Rule and directory to ſquare the Iudge, and that the Iudge is the publicke practicall interpreter of the Law.</p>

               <p>3, The King is either the ſole interpreter of Law, in reſpect, he is to follow the Law as his Rule, and ſo he is a miniſteriall interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Law, or he is an interpreter of the Law according to that ſuper-dominion of abſolute power, that he hath above the Law.

Whence it is cleare, that the people and Princes put on the Law its true ſenſe and meaning, for <hi>Ionathans</hi> taſting of a little honey, though as it was againſt that ſinfull and precipitate circumſtance a raſh oath, yet it was not againſt the ſubſtance and true intent of the Law, which was the peoples ſpeedy purſuite of the enemy.

The Pope and <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> cannot put on the Scripture, <hi>Ex plenitudine poteſtatis,</hi> what ever meaning they will, no more then they can, out of abſolute power, make Canonicke Scripture. Now ſo it is, that the King by his abſolute power cannot make Law no Law.</p>

               <p>3. This is the difference between Gods Will, and the will of the<note place="margin">Argum. 3.</note> King, or any mortall creature. Things are juſt and good, becauſe God willeth them, eſpecially things poſitively good (though I conceive it hold in all things) and <hi>God</hi> doth not will things, becauſe they are good and juſt, But the creature, be he King, or any never ſo eminent, doe will things, becauſe they are good and juſt, and the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:119219:150"/>
Kings willing of a thing, maketh it not good and juſt: for only Gods will, not the Creatures will, can be the cauſe why things are good and juſt. If therefore it be ſo, it muſt undeniably hence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the <hi>Kings</hi> will maketh not a juſt Law to have an unjuſt and bloody ſenſe: and he cannot, as <hi>King,</hi> by any abſolute ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominion over the Law, put a juſt ſenſe on a bloody and unjuſt Law.</p>
               <p>4. The advancing of any man to the Throne and Royall dignitie, putteth not the man above the number of rationall men: But no ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall man can create, by any act of power, never ſo tranſcendent or boundleſſe, a ſenſe to a Law, contrary to the Law.

               <p>The ſtate of the queſtion is much perverted, for theſe be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent queſtions, Whether the <hi>Kingdom</hi> may dethrone a wicked and <hi>Tyrannous Prince?</hi> And whether may the <hi>Kingdom</hi> take up arms againſt the man who is the <hi>King,</hi> in their own innocent defence: For the former is an Act offenſive, and of puniſhing, the latter is an Act of Defence.</p>
               <p>2. The preſent queſtion is not of Subjects onely, but of the Eſtates, and Parliamentary Lords of a Kingdom; I utterly deny theſe as they are Iudges, to be ſubjects to the King; for the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, Whether is the King, or the repreſentative Kingdom greateſt, and which of them be ſubject one to another: I affirm, Amongſt Iudges as Iudges, not one is the Commander or Superiour, and the other, the commanded or ſubject.

                  <hi>Majeſtatis, of intire power and Soveraignty; ſome Kings by pactions or voluntary agreement, between King and people.</hi> But I judge this a vain diſtinction: For the limited Prince, ſo he be limited to a power onely of doing juſt and right; by this is not a Prince <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grae Majeſtatis</hi> of entire Royall Majeſtie, whereby he may do both good, and alſo play the Tyrant; but a power to do ill, being no wayes eſſentiall, yea, repugnant to the abſolute Majeſtie of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> cannot be an eſſentiall part of the Majeſtie of a lawfull King; and therefore the Prince limited by voluntary and poſitive paction onely, to rule according to law and equity, is the good, lawfull, and entire Prince, if he have not power to do every thing juſt and good in that regard, onely he is not an intire and compleat Prince. So the man will have it lawfull to reſiſt the limited Prince, not the abſolute Prince; by the contrary, it is more lawfull to me to reſiſt the abſolute Prince, then the limited, in as much, as we may with ſafer conſciences reſiſt the Tyrant, and the Lyon, then the juſt Prince and the Lamb.

We owe fear and honour as due, to be rendred to the man who is <hi>King,</hi> becauſe he is a <hi>King,</hi> not becauſe he is a man; for it is the higheſt feare and honour due to any mortall man, which is due to the <hi>King,</hi> as <hi>King.</hi> 11.

But Cavaliers reſiſt the inferior Iudges as men, and have killed divers members of both Houſes of Parliament: but they will not ſay, that they killed them as <hi>Judges,</hi> but as Rebels. If therefore to be a Rebell, as a wicked Man, and to be a Iudge, are differenced thus: then, to be a Man, and to commit ſome acts of Tyrannie; and to be the ſupreme Iudge and King, are two different things. 12. Mr. <hi>Knox, Hiſt. of Scotland, l.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">Pag. 141.</note> The Congregation, in a letter to the Nobilitie, ſay: <hi>There is great difference betwixt the Authoritie, which is Gods Ordinance, and the Perſons of thoſe who are placed in authoritie. The Authoritie, and Gods ordinances can never doe wrong; for it commandeth that Vice and wicked men be puniſhed, and Vertue, with vertuous men and juſt. be maintained: But the corrupt Perſon placed in this Authoritie, may offend, and moſt commonly doe contrary to this Authoritie: and is then the corruption of Man to be followed, by reaſon that it is clothed with the name of Authoritie?</hi> And they give inſtance in <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Saul, who were lawfall Kings, and yet corrupt Men.</hi> And certainly, the Man, and the Divine authoritie, differ as the Subject and the Accident; as that which is under a Law, and can offend <hi>God;</hi> and that which is neither capable of Law, nor ſinne. 13.

               <p>Doct. <hi>Ferne, Sect. 9. pag. 58. The diſtinction of perſonall and legall will, hath place in evill actions, but not in reſiſtance, where we cannot ſever the perſon, and the dignitie, or authority, becauſe we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſiſt the power, but we muſt reſiſt the perſon who hath the power.</hi> Saul <hi>had lawfully the command of Arms, but that power he uſeth unjuſtly, againſt innocent</hi> David. <hi>I ask when theſe Emperours took away lives and goods at their pleaſure; was that a power ordained of God? No, but an Illegall will, a Tyranny, but they might not reſiſt: nay, but they cannot reſiſt: for that power and ſoveraigntie imployed to compaſſe theſe illegall commandments, was ordained and ſettled in them. When</hi> Pilate <hi>condemned our Saviour, it was an illegall will, yet our Saviour acknowledgeth in it</hi> Pilates <hi>power, that was given him from above. Anſw.</hi> 1. Here we have the diſtinction, denyed by <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſts,</hi> granted by D. <hi>Fern;</hi> but if when the King commands us to do wickedneſſe, we may reſiſt that perſonall will, and when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth us to ſuffer unjuſtly we cannot reſiſt his will, but we muſt reſiſt alſo his Royall perſon. What? Is it not ſtill the King, and his perſon ſacred, as his power is ſacred, when he commandeth the ſubjects to do unjuſtly, as when he commandeth them to ſuffer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly? It were fearfull to ſay, when Kings command any one act of idolatry, they are no longer Kings; if for conſcience I am to ſuffer unjuſtly, when <hi>Nero</hi> commandeth unjuſt puniſhment, becauſe <hi>Nero</hi> commanding ſo, remaineth Gods Miniſter. Why? But when <hi>Nero</hi> commandeth me to worſhip an Heathen God, I am upon the ſame ground to obey that unjuſt will in doing ill: For <hi>Nero</hi> in commanding Idolatry, remaineth the Lords Miniſter, his perſon is ſacred in the one commandment of doing ill, as in inflicting ill of puniſhment. And do I not reſiſt his perſon in the one, as in the other? His power and his perſon are unſeparably conjoyned by God in the one, as in the other, 2. In bodily thruſting out of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>z<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zah</hi> from the Temple, theſe fourſcore valiant men did reſiſt the Kings perſon, by bodily violence, as well as his power. 3. If the power of killing the Martyrs in <hi>Nero,</hi> was no power ordained of God, then the reſiſting of <hi>Nero,</hi> in his taking away the lives of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> was but the reſiſting of Tyranny: And certainly, if that

We are not to be ſubject to all powers <hi>in concreto,</hi> by the Text; for we are not to be ſubject to powers lawfull, yet commanding active obedience to things unlawfull. Now ſubjection includeth active obedience of honour, love, fear, paying tribute, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of need force, ſome powers muſt be excepted. 5. <hi>Pilates</hi> power is meerly a power by <hi>divine permiſſion,</hi> not a <hi>power ordained of God,</hi> as are the powers ſpoken of <hi>Rom. 13. Gregori. mor. l. 3. c.</hi> 11. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaith, <hi>This was Satans power given to Pilate, againſt Chriſt.

                     <hi>Pilates</hi> power to crucifie Chriſt, was no Law-power given by God to <hi>Pilate</hi> as a Iudge.</note> Chriſt is anſwering <hi>Pilate, John 19. 10. Knoweſt thou not, that I have power to crucifie thee?</hi> This was an untruth. <hi>Pilate</hi> had a command to worſhip him, and beleeve in him; and whereas <hi>Ferne</hi> ſaith, <hi>Sect. 9. pag. 59. Pilate had power to judge any accuſed before him:</hi> It is true, but he being obliged to beleeve in Chriſt, he was obliged to be perſwaded of Chriſts innocency; and ſo neither to judge, nor receive accuſation againſt him: and the power he ſaith, he had to crucifie, was a <hi>Law-power</hi> in <hi>Pilates</hi> meaning, but not in very deed any Law-power; becauſe a Law-power is from Gods regulating will in the fifth Commandment; but no creature hath a lawfull or a Law-power to crucifie Chriſt. 2. A Law-power is for good, <hi>Rom. 13. 4. A power to crucifie Chriſt,</hi> is for ill. 3. A Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power is a terrour to ill works, and a praiſe to good. <hi>Pilates</hi> power to <hi>crucifie Chriſt,</hi> was the contrary. 4. A Law-power is to execute wrath on ill-doing, a power to crucifie Chriſt is no ſuch. 5. A Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power conciliateth honour, fear, and veneration to the perſon of the Iudge, a power to crucifie Chriſt, conciliateth no ſuch thing, but a diſgrace to <hi>Pilate.</hi> 6. The Genuine Acts of a lawfull power, are lawfull Acts; for ſuch as is the Fountain-power, ſuch are the Acts flowing therefrom; good Acts flow not from bad powers, neither hath God given a power to ſin, except by way of permiſſion.</p>

               <p>Aſſertion 1. Patient ſuffering of wicked men, and violent reſiſting are not incompatible, but they may well ſtand together: So this conſequence is the baſis of the argument, and it is juſt nothing. To wit, Servants are to ſuffer unjuſtly wounds and buffeting of their wicked Maſters, and they are to bear it patiently; <hi>Ergo,</hi> Servants are in conſcience obliged to non-reſiſtance.

But if they ſay, he would not reſiſt, and yet might have done all theſe lawfully, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe be lawfull meanes, and reſiſtance with the ſword un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull; becauſe, <hi>He that taketh the ſword, ſhall periſh by the ſword.</hi> Let me Anſwer then, 1. They leave the argument from Chriſts example, who was thus farre ſubject to higher powers, that he would not reſiſt, and plead from the unlawfulneſſe of reſiſtance; this is <hi>petitio principii.</hi> 2. He that taketh the ſword without Gods warrant, which <hi>Peter</hi> had not, but the contrary, he was himſelfe a Sathan to Chriſt, who would but councell him not to die; but there is no ſhadow of a word to prove that violent reſiſting is unlawfull, when the King and his Iriſh cut-throats purſue us unjuſtly; onely Chriſt ſaith, when God may deliver extraordinarily by his Angels, except it be his abſolute will, that his Son ſhould drink the cup of death, then to take the ſword, when <hi>God</hi> hath declared his will on the contrary, is unlawfull; and that is all: Though I doe not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion but Chriſts asking for ſwords, and his arreſting all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the ground, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18. 6. backward, is a juſtifying of ſelfe-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. But hit herto it is cleare by <hi>Chriſts</hi> example, that he onely was commanded to ſuffer. Now the ſecond caſe in which ſuffering falleth under a Commandement, is indirectly and comparatively, when it commeth to the election of the witneſſe of Jeſus, that it is referred to them, either to deny the truth of Chriſt and his name, or then to ſuffer death, the choiſe is apparently evident, and this
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:119219:165"/>
choiſe that perſecuters referre us unto, is to us a Commandement of God, that we muſt chooſe ſuffering for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and refuſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt Chriſt: but the ſuppoſition muſt ſtand, that this alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native is unavoydable, that is not in our power to decline either ſuffering for Chriſt, or denying of Chriſt before men; otherwayes no man is to expect the reward of a witneſſe of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> who having a lawfull poſſible meanes of eſchewing ſuffering, doth yet caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into ſuffering needleſly. But I prove that ſuffering by men of this world, falleth not formally and directly under any divine po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Law, for the Law of nature, what ever <hi>Arminians</hi> in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, or this <hi>Arminian</hi> excommunicate think with them, (for<note place="margin">Conſeſ. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrant.</note> they teach that God gave a Commandement to <hi>Adam,</hi> to abſtaine from ſuch and ſuch fruit with paine and trouble to ſinleſſe nature) doth not command ſuffering, or any thing contrary to nature as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<note place="margin">Suffering not commanded of God formally.</note> is ſinleſſe: I prove it thus, 1. What ever falleth under a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Commandement of <hi>God,</hi> I may ſay here, under any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of <hi>God,</hi> is not a thing under the free will and power of others, from whom we are not diſcended neceſſarily by naturall ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, but that men of the world kill me, even theſe from whom I am not diſcended by naturall generation (which I ſpeake to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>Adam,</hi> who killed all his poſterity) is not in my free will, either as if they had my common nature in that act, or as if I were acceſſory by counſell, conſent, or approbation to that act, for this is under the free-will and power of others, not under my owne free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will: <hi>Ergo,</hi> that I ſuffer by others is not under my free-will, and cannot fall under a Commandement of God: And certainly, it is an irrationall Law, (glorified be his name) that God ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <hi>Antipas</hi> either formally to ſuffer, or formally not to ſuffer death by theſe of the Synagogue of Sathan, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 13. becauſe if they be pleaſed not to kill him, it is not in his free-will to be killed by them; and if they ſhall have him in their power (except God extraordinarily deliver) it is not in his power, in an ordinary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, not to be killed. 2. All theſe places of Gods word, that recommendeth ſuffering to the followers of Chriſt, do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand formally that we ſuffer; <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſuffering falleth not formally under any Commandement of God; I prove the Antecedent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if they be conſidered, they prove only that comparatively we are to chooſe rather to ſuffer, then to deny Chriſt before men, <hi>Mat. 10, 28, 32. Revel. 2. 13. Mat. 10. 37. Mat. 16. 24. c.</hi> 19. 29.

Suffering ſimply according to ſubſtance of the paſſion (I cannot ſay action) is common to good and ill, and to the wicked, yea to the damned in hell, who ſuffer againſt their will, and that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be joyned according to its ſubſtance as an act of formall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ſubjection to higher powers, Kings, Fathers, Maſters, by force of the fifth commandement, and of the place <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1, 2.<note place="margin">Patience in ſuffering is commanded, not ſuffering it ſelf formally.</note> Which according to its ſubſtance, wicked men ſuffer, and the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in hell alſo againſt their will. 4.

a law) is a chymera, a dream, and <hi>repugnantia in adjecto,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I utterly deny that reſiſtance paſſive or ſubjection paſſive, doth formally fal under either commandment of God affirmative, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, onely the unlawfull manner of reſiſtance by way of revenge, or for defence of Popery and falſe Religion, and out of impatient tolleration of Monarchy or any Tyranny is forbidden in Gods word, and certainly all the words uſed <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. as they fall under a formal commandement of God, or words of action, not of any Chymericall paſſive obedience, as we are not to reſiſt actively Gods ordinance, as his ordinance, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. 2. that is, to reſiſt God actively. 2.

A certaine <hi>Galilean</hi> made the <hi>Galileans</hi> beleeve that they ſhould not pay tribute to <hi>Strangers,</hi> and that they ſhould call none Lord, but the God of heaven, as <hi>Ioſeph.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Antiq. Iudaic. l. 20. c.</hi> 2. and <hi>De bell. Iudaic. l. 7. c.</hi> 29. yea and <hi>Hieron. Com. in 3. Tit.</hi> ſaith, At this time the ſect of the Galileans were on foot. It is like the Jews were thought to be <hi>Galileans,</hi> and that their liberty purchaſed in Chriſt could not conſiſt with the order of maſter and ſervant, King and ſubject. And to remove this, <hi>Paul</hi> eſtabliſheth Magiſtracie, and commandeth obedience in the <hi>Lord;</hi> and he is more to prove the office of the Magiſtrate to be of <hi>God,</hi> then any other thing; and to ſhew what is his due, then to eſtabliſh abſoluteneſſe in <hi>Nero</hi> to be of <hi>God;</hi> yea to me, every word in the Text ſpeaketh <hi>limitedneſſe of

No miniſter of God for good, &amp;c. can be a power to which we ſubmit our ſelves on earth, as next unto God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controlment. 5. That paſſive obedience falleth formally under no commandement of God, I prove thus: All obedience lyable to a divine commandement, doth commend morally the performer of obedience, as having a will conformed to Gods morall Law, and deformity betwixt the will of him who performeth not obedience, involveth the non-obedient in wrath and guiltineſſe. But non-paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſubjection to the ſword of the Judge doth not morally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him that ſuffereth not puniſhment, for no man is formally a ſinner againſt a morall law, becauſe he ſuffereth not the ill of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; nor is he morally good, or to be commended, becauſe hee ſuffereth ill of puniſhment, but becauſe he doth the ill of ſin. And all evil of puniſhment u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And 2. It neceſſarily hence followeth, that an act which is phyſically an act of offending my brother, yea even to the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of his life is often morally and legally an act of lawfull ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: an offending of another neceſſitated from the ſole invention of ſelf-defence is no more but an act of innocent ſelf defence: if <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> with his men had killed any of <hi>Sauls</hi> men, in a ſet battel, <hi>David</hi> and his men onely intending ſelf defence, the waren <hi>Davids</hi> part was meere defenſive, for phyſicall actions of killing, indifferent of themſelves, yet imperated by a principle of naturall ſelf-defence, and clothed with this formall end of ſelf-defence, or according to the ſubſtance of the action, the act is of ſelf-defence. If therefore one ſhall wound me deadly, and I know it is my death, after that, to kill the killer of my ſelfe, I being onely a private man, muſt be no act of ſelf-defence, but of homicide, becauſe it cannot be imperated by a ſinleſſe dictate of a naturall conſcience, for this end of ſelf-defence, after I know I am killed. Any mean not uſed for preventing death, muſt be an act of revenge, not of ſelf-defence, for it is phyſically un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſutable for the intended end of ſelf-defence. And ſo for a ſervant buffeted, to buffet againe, is of the ſame nature: the ſecond buffet not being a conducible meane to ward the firſt buffet, but a meane to procure heavier ſtroakes and poſſibly killing, it cannot be an act of ſelf defence, for an act of ſelf defence muſt be an act deſtinated <hi>ex naturarei,</hi> onely for defence, and if it be known to be an act of ſole offending, without any known neceſſary relation of a mean to ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defence as the end, it cannot be properly an act of ſelf-defence.</p>

For though<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I be not abſolute Lord of my owne goods, and ſo may not at my ſole pleaſure give tribute and expend monies to the hurting of my children, where I am not by Gods Law or Mans Law obliged to pay tribute; and though I be not an abſolute Lord of my members, to expoſe face, and cheeks, and back to ſtripes and whips at my owne meere will, yet have
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:119219:168"/>
we a comparative dominion given to us of God in matters of goods, and diſpoſing of our members, (I think I may except the caſe of mutilation, which is a little death) for buffets, becauſe Chriſt no doubt to teach us the like, would rather give of his goods, and pay tribute, where it is not due, then that this ſcandall lay on the way of Chriſt, that Chriſt was no loyall ſubject to lawfull Emperors and Kings. And 1 <hi>Cor. 9. Paul</hi> would rather not take ſtipend, though it was due to him, then hinder the courſe of the Goſpel. And the like is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. where the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were rather to ſuffer loſſe in their goods, then to goe to Law before Infidel Judges, and by the like to prevent greater inconveniences, and mutilation, and death; the Chriſtian ſervant hath that dominion over his members, rather to ſuffer buffets, then to ward off buffets with violent reſiſtance. But it is no conſequent that innocent ſubjects ſhould ſuffer death of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, and ſervants be killed by maſters, and yet that they ſhall not be allowed by the law of nature to defend themſelves, by re-offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when onely ſelf-defence is intended, becauſe we have not that dominion over life and death. And therefore as a man is his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers murtherer, who, with froward <hi>Cain,</hi> will not be his brothers keeper, and may preſerve his brothers life, without loſſe of his owne life, when his brother is unjuſtly preſerved; ſo when he may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his owne life, and doth not that which Natures Law alloweth him to doe, rather to kill ere he be killed, he is guilty of ſelf-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; becauſe he is deficient in the duty of lawfull ſelf-defence. But I grant to offend or kill is not of the nature of defenſive warre, but accidentall thereunto, and yet killing of cut-throats ſent forth by the illegal commandement of the <hi>King</hi> may be intended, as a mean and a lawfull mean of ſelf-defence. 2. Of two ills of puniſhment, we have a comparative dominion over our ſelves, a man may caſt his goods in the ſea to redeeme his life. So for to redeeme peace, we may ſuffer buffets, but becauſe death is the greateſt ill of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, God hath not made it eligible to us, when lawfull ſelf defence is at hand; But in defending our own life againſt Tyrannicall power, though we do it by offending and killing, we reſiſt no ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, onely I judge killing of the King in ſelf-defence not lawfull, becauſe ſelf-defence muſt be national, on juſt cauſes.

Now to be diſobedient to a juſt power ſummoning a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor, is to hinder that lawfull power, to be put forth in lawfull Acts, for the Judge cannot purge the land of blood, if the murtherer flee. 3.

It is no Anſwer that D. <hi>Ferne</hi> and other Royaliſts give, that <hi>Eliſha made no perſonall reſiſtance to the King himſelfe, but onely to the Kings cut-throat, ſent to take away his head.</hi> Yea they ſay, <hi>It is lawfull to reſiſt the Kings cut-throats.</hi> But the text is cleere, that the violent reſiſtance is made to the King himſelfe alſo, for he addeth, <hi>Is not the ſound of his Maſters feet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him?</hi> And by this anſwer, it is lawfull to keep Townes with iron gates and barres, and violently to oppoſe the <hi>Kings cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throats,</hi> comming to take away the heads of the <hi>Parliaments</hi> of both Kingdomes, and of Proteſtants in the three Kingdomes.</p>
               <p>Some Royaliſts are ſo impudent, as to ſay that there was no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence here, and that <hi>Eliſha</hi> was an extraordinary man, and that it is not lawfull for us to call a King the <hi>ſon of a murtherer,</hi> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Eliſha</hi> did: but <hi>Ferne ſect. 2. pag.</hi> 9. forgetting himſelfe, ſaith from hence, <hi>It is lawfull to reſiſt the Prince himſelfe, thus farre, as to ward his blowes, and hold his hands:</hi> But let <hi>Ferne</hi> anſwer, if the violent binding of the Princes hands, that he ſhall not be able to kill, be a greater violence done to his Royall perſon, then <hi>Davids cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the lap of</hi> Sauls <hi>garment;</hi> for certainly, the Royall body of a Prince is of more worth then his cloathes. Now it was a ſinne, I judge, that <hi>ſmote</hi> Davids <hi>conſcience,</hi> that he being a ſubject, and not in the act of naturall ſelf-defence, did cut the garment of the Lords Annointed. Let <hi>Ferne</hi> ſee then how he will ſave his owne princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, for certainly hee yeeldeth the cauſe for me; I judge that the perſon of the King, or any Judge, who is the Lords Deputy, as is the King, is ſacred, and that remaining in that honourable caſe, no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject can without guiltineſſe before God, put hands in his perſon, the caſe of naturall ſelf-defence being excepted: for becauſe the Royall dignity doth not advance a King above the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of men, and the Throne maketh him not leave off to bee a man, and a man that can do wrong; and therefore as one that doth manifeſt violence to the life of a man, though his ſubject, he may

be reſiſted with bodily reſiſtance in the caſe of unjuſt and violent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion. It is a vaine thing to ſay, <hi>Who ſhall be judge betweene the King and his ſubjects? The ſubject cannot judge the King, becauſe none can be judge in his owne cauſe, and an inferiour or equall cannot judge a ſuperiour or equall.</hi> But I anſwer, 1. This is the Kings owne cauſe alſo, and he doth unjuſt violence as a man, and not as a King, and ſo he cannot be judge more then the ſubject. 2. Every one that doth unjuſt violence as he is ſuch, is inferiour to the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and ſo ought to be judged by ſome. 3. There is no need of the formality of a judge in things evident to natures eye, ſuch as are manifeſtly unjuſt violences: Nature in acts naturall of ſelf-defence, is judge, party, accuſer, witneſſe, and all; for it is ſuppoſed the Judge is abſent, when the Judge doth wrong.

All power of warre that the King hath is cumulative, not privative, and not diſtructive, but given for the ſafety of the Kingdome, as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King cannot take from one particular man the power of the ſword for naturall ſelf-preſervation, becauſe it is the birth-right of life; neither can the King take from a community and Kingdome a power of riſing in Armes for their owne defence: If an Armie of <hi>Turks</hi> ſhall ſuddenly invade the Land, and the Kings conſent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe cannot be had (for it is eſſentially involved in the office of the King as King, that all the power of the ſword that he hath, be for their ſafety) or if the King ſhould as a man refuſe his conſent, and interdict and diſcharge the Land to riſe in Armes, yet they have his Royall conſent, though they want his perſonall conſent, in reſpect that his office obligeth him to command them to riſe in Armes. 2.

                  <hi>King</hi> command them ſo to doe; this is like the Court-faith. 2. The Kings power of warres is for the ſafety of his people; if he deny his conſent to their raiſing of Armes till they be deſtroyed, he playeth the Tyrant, not the King, and the law of Nature will neceſſitate them, either to defend themſelves (ſeeing flight of all in that caſe is harder then death) elſe they muſt be guilty of ſelf-murther. Now the Kings commandement of not riſing in Armes, at beſt is poſitive and againſt the nature of his Office, and it floweth then from him as from a man, and ſo muſt be farre inferiour to the naturall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, which commandeth ſelf-preſervation, if wee would not be guilty of ſelf-murther, and of <hi>obeying men, rather then God.</hi> So <hi>Althuſius Polit. c. 25. n. 9.

The ground of the preſent wars againſt the King <hi>(ſaith D.</hi> Ferne, <hi>ſect. 4. pag. 13.)</hi> is falſe, to wit, that the Parliament is coor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate with the King, but ſo the King ſhall not be ſupreme, the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments conſent is required to an act of ſupremacie, but not to a denyall of that act. And there can no more (<hi>ſaith</hi> Arniſaeus de jure majeſtatis, c. 3. in quo conſiſtat eſſen. majeſt. c. 3. n. 1. and c. 2. anjur. majeſt. ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par. &amp;c. n. 2.) be two equall and coordinate ſupreme powers, then

If we regard the derived and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive power in Parliamentarie acts, they make but a totall and compleat ſoveraigne power, yet ſo as the ſoveraigne power of the Parliament being habitually and underived, a prime and fountaine power, (for I doe not here ſeparate people and Parliament) is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect without the King, for all Parliamentarie acts, as is cleare, in that the Parliament make Kings. 2. Make Lawes, raiſe Armies, when either the King is minor, captived, tyrannous, or dead, but Royall power Parliamentarie without the Parliament is null, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is eſſentially but a part of the Parliament, and can work no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſeparated from the Parliament, no more then a hand cut off from the body, can write; and ſo here we ſee two ſupremes coor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Amongſt infinite things there cannot be two, becauſe it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volveth a contradiction, that an infinite thing can be created, for then ſhould it be finite; but a royall power is eſſentially a derived and created power and ſupreme, <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> onely in relation to ſingle men, but not in relation to the Communitie; it is alwayes a creature of the communitie with leave of the Royaliſt. 2. It is falſe, that to an act of Parliamentarie ſupremacie the conſent of the King is required, for it is repugnant that there can be any Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie judiciall act without the Parliament, but there may be without the King. 3. More falſe it is, that the King hath a negative voice in Parliament, then he ſhall be ſole Judge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Parliament, the Kings Creator and Conſtituent, ſhall be a cypher.</p>

And when the King defendeth not ſubjects againſt their enemies, all fellow-ſubjects, by the law of Nature, of Nations, the Civill, and cannon Law, have a naturall priviledge to defend one another, and are mutuall Magiſtrates to one another, when there be no other Magiſtrates. If an Army of <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi> would come upon Britaine, if the King were dead, as he is ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy dead in this juncture of time, when he refuſeth to helpe his ſubjects, one part of Britaine would help another: As <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> King of <hi>Iudah</hi> did right in helping <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo the Lord had approved of the warre. If the left hand be wounded, and the left eye put out, nature teacheth that the whole burden of naturall acts is devolved on the other hand and eye, and; ſo are they obliged to helpe one another.</p>
               <p>

               <p>11. <hi>Meroz is under a curſe, who helpeth not the Lord,</hi> one part of a Church another. A woe lieth on them that are at eaſe in <hi>Zion,</hi> and helpeth not afflicted <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> ſo farre as they are able.</p>
               <p>12. The law of Gratitude obligeth us to this: <hi>England</hi> ſent an Armie to free both our ſoules and bodies from the bondage of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and the fury of the French, upon which occaſion a Parliament at Leith, Anno 1560. eſtabliſhed Peace and Religion, and then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they helped us againſt a faction of Papiſts, in our owne boſome; for which we take Gods name in a prayer, ſeeking grace never to forget that kindneſſe.</p>
               <p>13. When Papiſts in Armes, had undone <hi>England</hi> (if <hi>God</hi> give them victory) they ſhould next fall on us, and it ſhould not be in the Kings power to reſiſt them. When our enemies within two dayes journey are in Armes, and have the perſon of our King, and his judgement, and ſo the breathing Law of the two Kingdomes under their power, we ſhould but ſleepe to be killed in our neſt, if we did not ariſe and fight for King, Church, Countrey, and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>

                  <hi>Object.</hi> By theſe and the like grounds, when the Kings Royall Perſon and life is in danger, he may uſe Papiſts as ſubjects, not as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts in his owne naturall ſelf-defence.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Hell and the Devill cannot ſay, that a thought was in any heart, againſt the Kings perſon: He ſleeped in Scotland ſafe, and at Weſtminſter in his owne Palace, when the Eſtates of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, would not ſo much as take the water-pot from his bed-ſide, and his Speare; and Satan inſtilled this traiterous lye, firſt in Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, then in Papiſts. 2. The King profeſſeth his maintenance of the true Proteſtant Religion, in his Declarations, ſince he tooke Armes; but if <hi>Saul</hi> had put Armes in the hands of <hi>Baals Prieſts,</hi> and in an Armie of <hi>Sidonians, Philiſtims, Ammonites,</hi> profeſſing their quarrell againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> was not to defend the <hi>King,</hi> but their <hi>Dagon</hi> and falſe gods; cleere it were, <hi>Sauls</hi> Armie ſhould not ſtand in relation of helpers of the Kings, but of advancers of their owne Religion.

One being a ſinfull man, ſhall ſooner ſin and turne a <hi>Nero</hi> (when he may goe to hell, and leade thouſands to hell with him <hi>gratis</hi>) then a multitude of ſinfull men, who have leſſe power to doe againſt Law: and a tyrannous killing of innocents, and a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Lawes, Liberties and Religion, by one who may <hi>by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> and <hi>without reſiſtance of mortall men,</hi> doe all ill, is more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and hurtfull, then diviſion and fraction incident to <hi>Ariſtocracy.</hi> 4. <hi>Caeſar is great, but Law and reaſon is greater:</hi> by an abſolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy all things are ruled by will and pleaſure above Law; then this government cannot be ſo good, as Law and Reaſon in a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the beſt, or by many. 5. Under abſolute <hi>Monarchy</hi> a free people is, <hi>actu primo,</hi> and in themſelves inſlaved, becauſe though the <hi>Monarch</hi> ſo abſolute ſhould kill all, hee cannot be controlled; there is no more but flight, prayers and teares remaining, and what greater power hath a Tyrant? none at all, ſo may we ſay.

Now if he have no abſoluteneſſe of Majeſty, he cannot confer ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours out of a principle that is none at all, <hi>unum quodque ſicut eſt, ita operatur,</hi> and if the people confer honours, then muſt Royaliſts grant that there is an abſolute Majeſty in the people, why then may they not derive Majeſty to a King? and why then do Royaliſts talk to us of Gods immediate creating of Kings, without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veening action of the people?</p>
               <p>4. By this abſolutneſſe of Majeſty, Kings may play the Tyrant as <hi>Samuel</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. foretelleth <hi>Saul</hi> would do. But I cannot beleeve that Kngs have the ſame very officiall abſolute power, from whence they do both acts of grace, goodneſſe and juſtice, ſuch as are to expone Laws extemporally in extraordinary caſes, to confer honours upon good and excellent men of grace to pardon offenders upon good grounds, and alſo-doe acts of extreme Tyrannie: For out of the ſame fountaine doth not proceed both ſweet water and bitter. Then by this abſoluteneſſe, Kings cannot doe acts of goodneſſe, juſtice and grace, and ſo they muſt doe good as Kings, and they muſt doe acts of tyrannie, as men, not from ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluteneſſe of majeſty.</p>
               <p>5. Inferiour Magiſtrates, in whom there is no abſoluteneſſe of Majeſty, according to Royaliſts, way, may expound laws alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporally, and doe acts of juſtice, without formalities of civill or municipall laws, ſo they keep the genuine intent of the Law, as they may pardon one that goeth up to the wall of a City, and diſcovereth the approach of the enemie, when the watchmen are ſleeping, though the Law be, <hi>That any aſcending to the wall of the Citie ſhall die.</hi> Alſo the inferiour Judge may make Judges and Deputies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himſelfe.</p>
               <p>6. This Diſtinction is neither grounded upon Reaſon or Lawes, nor on any Word of God. Not the former, as is proved before, for there is no abſolute power in a King to do above, or againſt law; all the officiall power that a King hath, is a Royall power to do good, for the ſafety and good of his ſubjects, and that according to law and

                  <hi>Royaliſts</hi> will have all <hi>Kings</hi> ſo abſolute, as it is ſin and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to <hi>God</hi> to reſiſt any) that all <hi>Kings</hi> have a divine law to kill all their ſubjects; ſurely, then it were better for the <hi>Church</hi> to want ſuch nurſe-fathers, as have abſolute power to ſuck their blood: and for ſuch a perpetuall permiſſive Law continuing to the end of the world, there is no word of God. Nor can we think that the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of one Princes heart, can be a ground for God to make a Law ſo deſtructive to his <hi>Church</hi> and all mankinde: ſuch a permiſſive Law, being a poſitive Law of God, muſt have a word of Chriſt for it, elſe we are not to receive it. 2. <hi>Arniſaeus cap. 4. diſtru.

For if Gods permiſſive Law warrant a Tyrant to kill two innocent men, it is tyranny more or leſſe, and the Law diſtinguiſheth not. 3. This permiſſive Law is expreſſely contrary to <hi>Gods</hi> Law, limiting all Kings <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 16, 17, 18. How then are we to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that God would make an univerſall Law contray to the Law that he eſtabliſhed before <hi>Iſrael</hi> had a King? 4. What <hi>Brentius</hi> ſaith is much for us, for he calleth this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Law a licence, and ſo to uſe it muſt be licentiouſneſſe. 5. <hi>Arniſaeus</hi> deſireth that Kings may uſe ſparingly the plenitude of their power, <hi>for publique good; there muſt be (ſaith he) neceſſity to make it lawfull to uſe the plenitude of this power juſtly; therefore Ahab ſinned, in that he unjuſtly poſſeſſed Naboths vineyard, though he ſinned ſpecially in this, that he came to the poſſeſſion by murther, and it was peculiar to the Iewes, that they could not transfer their poſſeſſions from one tribe to another.</hi> But if it be ſo, then this power of abſoluteneſſe is not given, by permiſſive Law, by which God permitted putting away of wives, for the object of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive Law is ſinne, but this plenitude of power may be juſtly put forth in act (ſaith he) if the publique good may be regarded: I would know what publique good can legittimate Tyranny and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the innocent, the intentions of men can make nothing intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecally evil to become good. And 6. How can that be a permiſſive Law of God, and not his approveing Law by which Kings create inferiour judges? for this is done by Gods approving will. 7. It is evident that <hi>Arniſaeus</hi> his minde is, that Kings may take their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects vineyards, and their goods, ſo they erre not in the manner, and
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:119219:205"/>
way of the act, ſo be like, if there had not been a peculiar Law that <hi>Naboth</hi> ſhould not ſell his vineyard, and if the King had had any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique uſe for it, he might have taken <hi>Naboths</hi> vineyard from him, but he ſpecially ſinned (ſaith he) <hi>in eo maxime culpatur, &amp;c.</hi> that he took away the mans vineyard by murthering of him, therefore ſaith <hi>Arniſaeus c. 1. de poteſt. maj. in bona privato.</hi> 2. that by the Kings Law 1 <hi>Sam. 8. There is given to the King, a dominion over the peoples ſons, daughters, fields, vineyards, olive-yards, ſervants and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>But 1. This law of the King then can be no ground for the Kings abſoluteneſſe above Law, and there can be no permiſſive Law of God here, for that which aſſerteth the Kings Royall Dominion over per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and things, that muſt be the Law of Gods approving, not his permiting evil, but this is ſuch a Law as <hi>Arniſaeus</hi> ſaith.</p>
               <p>2. The text ſpeaketh of no Law or lawful power, or of any abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of King <hi>Saul;</hi> but of his wicked cuſtome, and his rapine and Tyranny, <hi>He will take your ſons, your daughters, your fields, and your vineyards from you. Saul</hi> took not theſe through any power of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion by Law, but by meere Tyranny.</p>
               <p>3. I have before cleared that the ſubjects have a propriety, and an uſe alſo, elſe how could we be obliged by vertue of the fift com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement to pay tribute to the King, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 7. for that which we pay, was as much the Kings before we payed, as when we have paied it.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Arniſaeus</hi> ſaith all are the Kings in reſpect of the univerſall ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, that the King hath in governing and ordering all to the univerſall end, the good of the Common-wealth, for as univerſall nature careth for the conſervation of the ſpece and kind, ſo doth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular nature care for the conſervation of individuals, ſo do men care for their private good, and the King is to refer every mans private goods, to the good of the publick, but the truth is, this taketh not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way propriety of goods from private men, retaining onely the uſe to private men, and giving the dominion to the King, becauſe this power that the King bath of mens goods, is not power of dominion, that the King hath over the goods of men, as if the King were <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus,</hi> Lord and owner of the fields and monyes of the private ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but it is a power to regulate the goods for a publique uſe, and
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:119219:206"/>
ſuppoſeth the abuſe of goods, when they are Monopolized to, and for private ends. 2. The power that the King hath over my bread is<note place="margin">What domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King hath over the goods of the ſubject.</note> not a power of dominion, ſo as he may eat my bread, as if it were his own bread, and he be Lord of my bread as I was ſometimes my ſelf, before I abuſed it, but it is a dominion unproperly, and abuſively ſo called, and is a meere fiduciary, and diſpenſatory power, becauſe he is ſet over my bread not to eat it, nor over my houſes to dwel in them, but onely with a miniſteriall power as a publique, though a honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſervant and watchman appointed by the community, as a mean for an end to regulate my bread, houſes, moneys, fields for the good of the publique.

becauſe nature teacheth to repel violence by violence, ſo it be done without deſire of revenge and malice.</p>
               <p>2. This is proved from the nature of a promiſe or covenant, for <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov. 6. 1. My ſon, if thou be ſurety for thy friend, if thou haſt ſtricken thy hand with a ſtranger, 2. Thou art ſnared with the words of thy mouth, &amp; art taken with the words of thy mouth.</hi> But whence is it that a man free is now ſnared as a beaſt in a gin or trap? Certainly <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith it is by a <hi>word</hi> and <hi>ſtriking of hands,</hi> by a word of promiſe and covenant. Now the Creditor hath coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive power, though he be an equall or an inferiour to the man who is ſurety, even by Law to force him to pay, and the Judge is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to give his coactive power to the Creditor, that he may force the ſurety to pay. Hence it is cleare that a Covenant maketh a free man under the coactive power of law to an equall and to weaker, and the ſtronger is by the law of fraternity to help the weaker, with his coactive power, to cauſe the ſuperiour fulfill his covenant. If then the King (giving, and not granting, he were ſuperiour to his whole Kingdome) come under a covenant to them, to ſeek their good, not his owne, to defend true Proteſtant Religion, they have power to compell him to keep his covenant, and <hi>Scotland</hi> (if the King be ſtronger then <hi>England,</hi> and break his covenant to them) is obliged by Gods law, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 11. to adde their forces and coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive power to help their brethren of <hi>England.</hi>

It is high preſumption in the Pope, to challenge to himſelf, the Title or Right of Chriſts univerſall Vicar on earth, by Divine right. The Pope, the Biſhop of Rome, hath no more by Divine right, (what he may have by poſitive Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call right, is not pertinent for us now to examine and diſcuſſe) no higher priviledge (except it be in extent) then the meaneſt Biſhop of the world in his Dioceſſe.</hi> And amongſt all proofes, he paſſing by Scriptures, which ſhould prove, or improve a Divine right, he will content himſelfe with one proofe of <hi>Cyprian, de unitat.

               <p>2. The <hi>Popes ſupremacie,</hi> by Papiſts, is expreſly reckoned amongſt unwritten Traditions, and ſo there is no neceſſitie that the right of it be proved from Scripture.</p>
               <p>3.

The doctrine taught by this Prelate, ſo Popiſh, &amp; hints, yea are more then evidences of groſſe Poperie in this book, and his other Pamphlet againſt Presbyteries; And his deſire that the Controverſie concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Popes ſupremacie, and others, were <hi>determined with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the judgement of the Fathers:</hi> doe cry, that he is but a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>Papiſt.</hi> For why will he ſubmit all other controverſies to the <hi>judgement of the Fathers?</hi> Why not to the Prophets and Apoſtles?

               <p>
                  <hi>P.

If this be their mind, the King is in a poore caſe. The principal authority is in the Deligate, and ſo the people is ſtill Iudge, and the King their Deputy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The <hi>P. Prelate</hi> taketh on him to write he knoweth not what, this is not our opinion. The <hi>King</hi> is <hi>King,</hi> and hath the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples power not as their Deputy.</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe the people is not principall Iudge, and the <hi>King</hi> ſubordinate. The <hi>King</hi> in the executive power of Lawes, is really a Soveraigne above the people, a Deputy is not ſo.</p>
               <p>2.

               <p>2. This is no more a reaſon for a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> then for a <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy,</hi> for we can reape the fruites of no government, except we ſubmit to it.</p>
               <p>3. We muſt ſubmit in <hi>Monarchy</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to ſome poſſible and accidentall inconveniences.</hi> Here be ſoft words, but is ſubverſion of

               <p>4. Are they only <hi>posſible and accidentall?</hi> but make a Monarch abſolute, as the <hi>P.

               <p>P. Prelate, They inferre, 1. They cannot without violation of a Divine ordinance, and breach of faith reſume the authority, they have placed in the King. 2. <hi>It<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Theſe nameleſſe Authors cannot inferre that an Oath is broken, which is made conditionally; all authority given by the people to the King is conditionall, that he uſe it for the ſafety of the people, if it be uſed for their diſtruction, they breake no faith to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume it, for they never made faith to give up their power to the King upon ſuch tearmes, and ſo they <hi>cannot be ſaid to reſume what they never gave.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. So the <hi>P.

roote out the <hi>bloody Iriſh,</hi> and in juſtice ſerve them, as they have ſerved us.</p>
               <p>3. This ordinance of the people giving lawfull power to a King, for the governing of the people in peace and godlineſſe, <hi>is Gods good pleaſure, and hath juſt reaſons and cauſes.</hi> But that the people make over a power to one man, to act all the inconveniences above na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, I mean the bloody and deſtructive inconveniences, hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of God, or reaſon in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P. Prelate.</hi> The reaſons of this opinion are, 1. If Power ſoveraigne were not in one, he could not have ſtrength enough to act all neceſſary parts and acts of government. 2. Nor to prevent diviſions which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend multitudes, or many indowed with equall power; and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors ſay, They muſt part with their native right entirely, for a greater good, and to prevent greater evills. 3.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I know none for this opinion, but the P. Prelate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.<note place="margin">Soveraigne power in the King, but not power of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie.</note> The firſt Reaſon may be made rhyme, but never reaſon: for though there be not abſolute power to good and ill, there may be ſtrength of limited power in abundance in the <hi>King,</hi> and ſufficient for all acts of juſt Government, and the adequate end of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is, <hi>ſalus populi,</hi> the ſafetie of the people. But the <hi>Roya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt</hi> will have ſtrength to be a Tyrant, and act all the Tyrannicall and bloody inconveniences of which we ſpake, <hi>an eſſentiall part of the power of a King;</hi> As if weakneſſe were eſſentiall to ſtrength; and a <hi>King</hi> could not be powerfull as a <hi>King,</hi> to doe good, and ſave and protect, except he had power alſo as a <hi>Tyrant</hi> to doe evill, and to deſtroy and waſte his people. This power is weakneſſe, and no part of the image of the greatneſſe of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> whom a <hi>King</hi> repreſenteth.</p>
               <p>2. The ſecond Reaſon condemneth <hi>Democracie</hi> and <hi>Ariſtocracie;</hi> as unlawfull, and maketh Monarchie the only Phyſick to <hi>cure</hi> theſe; as if there were no Government an ordinance of <hi>God,</hi> ſave only ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Monarchie, which indeed is no ordinance of <hi>God</hi> at all, but contrary to the nature of a lawfull <hi>King,</hi> Deut. 17. 3.</p>
               <p>3. That people <hi>muſt part with their native right totally,</hi> to make an abſolute Monarch; is, as if the whole members of the Body would part with their whole nutritive power, to cauſe the Milt to ſwell;
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:119219:218"/>
which would be the deſtruction of the Body.</p>
               <p>4. The people cannot diveſt themſelves of power of defenſive Warres, more then they can part with Nature, and put themſelves in a condition inferior to a ſlave, who, if his maſter, who hath power to ſell him, invade him unjuſtly, to take away his life, may oppoſe violence to unjuſt violence. And the other Conſequences are null.</p>

Divines ſay, that by men in ſacred Orders Chriſt doth rule his Church mediately, in thoſe things which primely concerne ſalvation; and that by Kings their ſcepter and power, he doth protect his Church, and what concerneth externall pompe, order and decencie. Then, in this latter ſenſe, Kings are no leſſe the immediate Vicegerents of Chriſt, than Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons, in the former.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Becauſe <hi>Kings</hi> hold their Crownes of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as Mediator and Redeemer, it followeth by as good conſequence, <hi>Kings</hi> are ſubmediators and under-Prieſts, and Redeemers, as Vicegerents. <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>King,</hi> hath no viſible Royall Vicegerents under him.</p>
               <p>2.

               <p>3. I underſtand not what the <hi>P. Prelate</hi> meaneth, <hi>that the King</hi>

the King here, to make him onely keep, or preſerve the Prelates Maſſe-Clothes: they intended indeed to make the <hi>King</hi> but the Popes ſervant, for all they ſay and do for him now.</p>
               <p>4. If the <hi>King be vicegerent of Chriſt</hi> in preſcribing Laws for the externall ordering of the worſhip, and all their decent ſymbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall Ceremonies: What more doth the Pope, and the Prelate in that kinde? He may, with as good warrant Preach and Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the Sacraments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P. Prelate.</hi> Kings have the ſign of the Croſſe on their Crowns.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Ergo, <hi>Baculus eſt in angulo.</hi> Prelates have put a croſſe in the Kings heart, and croſſed Crown and Throne to, Really. Some Knights, ſome Ships, ſome Cities and Burroughes, do carry a croſſe; are they made <hi>Chriſts vice-gerents</hi> of late? By what antiquity doth the Croſſe ſignifie Chriſt? Of old it was a badge of Chriſtians, no Religious Ceremony; and is this all. The <hi>King</hi> is the vicegerent of <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> The Prelates we know, adore the Croſſe with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worſhip: ſo muſt they adore the Crown.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P. Prelate.</hi> Grant that the Pope were the Vicar of Chriſt in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things, it followeth not: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Kings Crowns are ſubject to the Pope; for Papiſts teach, that all power that was in Chriſt, as man, as power to work miracles, to inſtitute Sacraments, was not tranſmitted to <hi>Peter</hi> and his ſucceſſors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a baſe conſequence, Make the Pope head of the Church: the King, if he be a mixed perſon, that is, half a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and Chriſts Vice-gerent; both he and Prelates muſt be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the head. Papiſts teach, that all in Chriſt as man, cannot be tranſmitted to <hi>Peter,</hi> but a Miniſteriall Catholike Headſhip (ſay <hi>Bucanus</hi> and his fellows) was tranſmitted from <hi>Chriſt</hi> as man, and viſible head, to <hi>Peter</hi> and the Pope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P. Prelate.</hi> I wiſh the Pope, who claimeth ſo neer alliance with<note place="margin">The P. Prelate prayeth for the Pope.</note> Chriſt, would learn of him to be meek and humble in heart; ſo ſhould he finde reſt to his own ſoul, to Church and State.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ſame was the wiſh of <hi>Gerſon, Occam,</hi> the Doctors of <hi>Paris,</hi> the fathers of the Councels of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil;</hi> yet all make him <hi>head of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The Excommunicate Prelate is turned Chaplain to Preach to the Pope: the <hi>Soul-reſt</hi> that Proteſtants wiſh to the Pope is, <hi>That the Lord would deſtroy him by the Spirit of his mouth, 2 Theſ.</hi> 2. 8. But <hi>P. Prelates,</hi> This wiſh is a Reformation of accidents,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:119219:220"/>
with the ſafety of the ſubject, the Pope, and is as good as a wiſh, That the Devill remaining a Devill, may finde reſt for his ſoul, all we are to pray for; as having place in the Church, are ſuppoſed members of the Church. The Prelate would not pray ſo for the Presbytery, by which he was ordained a Paſtour, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. though he be now an Apoſtate: It is gratitude to pray for his lucky father the Pope. What ever the Prelate wiſh, we pray for, and beleeve, that deſolation ſhall be his Soul-reſt, and that the venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Lord, and of his Temple, ſhall fall upon him, and the Prelates his ſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P. Prelate.</hi> That which they purpoſe, by denying Kings to be Chriſts Vice-gerents, is to ſet up a Soveraignty Eccleſiaſticall in Presbyteries, to conſtrain Kings, repeal his Laws, correct his Satutes, reverſe his Judgements, to cite, convent, and cenſure Kings; and if there be not power to execute, what Presbyteries decrees, they may call and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the help of the people, in whom is the underived Majeſtie; and promiſe, and ſwear, and covenant to defend their fancies, againſt all mortall men, with their Goods, Lands, Fortunes, to admit no diviſive motion; and this Soveraign Aſſociation maketh every private man an armed Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> You ſee the Excommunicate Apoſtats tuſles againſt the<note place="margin">The Power of Presbyteries Miniſteriall.</note> Presbytery of a Reformed Church, from which he had his baptiſm, fiath, miniſtery.</p>
               <p>1. We deny the <hi>King</hi> to be the head of the Church.</p>
               <p>2. We aſſert, that in the Paſtors, Doctors, and Elders of the Church, there is a Miniſteriall power, as ſervants under Chriſt, in his authority, and name, to rebuke and cenſure Kings; that there is <hi>revenge in the Goſpel againſt all diſobedience, 2 Cor.</hi> 2. 6. and 10. 6. <hi>The rod of God, 1 Cor. 4. 21. The rod of Chriſts lips, Iſai. 11. 4. The Scepter and Sword of Chriſt, Revel.</hi> 1. 16. and 19. 15. <hi>The Keyes of his Kingdom, to binde and looſe, open and ſhut, Matth.</hi> 18. 17. 18. and 16. 19. 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 1, 2, 3. 2 Theſ. 3. 14, 15. 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 19. and 5. 22. and 5. 17. And that this power is committed to the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of Chriſts houſe, call them as you will.</p>
               <p>3. For reverſing of Laws made for the eſtabliſhing of Popery,<note place="margin">P. Prelates de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Kings to be ſubject to the Goſpel and Diſcipline of Chriſt.</note> we think the Church of Chriſt did well to declare all theſe unjuſt grievous decrees; and that woe is due to the Iudges, even the Queen, if they ſhould not repent, as <hi>Iſai.</hi> 10. 1. And this P. muſt ſhew his teeth in this, againſt our Reformation in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:119219:220"/>
he once commended in Pulpit, as a glorious work of Gods right arm. And the Aſſemble of <hi>Glaskow,</hi> 1637. declared, That Biſhops though eſtabliſhed by Acts of Parliament, procured by Prelates onely, Commiſſioners, and Agents, for the Church, who betrayed their truſt, were unlawfull, and did ſupplicate, That the enſuing Parliament would annull theſe wicked Acts. They think God pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledgeth neither King, nor others from Church-Cenſures: the <hi>P. Prelates</hi> impriſoned, and ſilenced the Miniſters of Chriſt, who preached againſt the publike ſins, the blood, oppreſſions, unjuſtice, open ſwearing, and blaſphemy of the holy Name of God, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing of Idolaters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in King and Court.</p>
               <p>4. They never ſought the help of the people, againſt the moſt unjuſt ſtanding Law of authority.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>They did never ſwear and covenant, to defend their own fancies,</hi> For the Confeſſion and Covenant of the Proteſtant Religion, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in Latin to all the Proteſtants in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> being termed a fancie, is a clear evidence, That this <hi>P. Prelate</hi> was juſtly excommunicated for Popery.</p>
               <p>6. This Covenant was ſworm by King <hi>James,</hi> and his houſe, by the whole Land, by the Prelates themſelves. And to this fancy, this <hi>P. Prelate</hi> by the Law of our Land was obliged to ſwear, when he received degrees in the Univerſitie.</p>
               <p>7. There is reaſon our Covenant ſhould provide <hi>againſt diviſive motions.</hi> The Prelates moved the King to command all the Land to ſwear our Covenant, in the Prelaticall ſenſe, againſt the intent thereof, and onely to devide, and ſo command. Iudge what Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion Prelates are of, who will have the Name of God prophaned by a whole Nation, by ſwearing fancies.</p>
               <p>8. Of making private men Magiſtrates, in defending themſelves againſt cut-throats. Enough already: Let the <hi>P. Prelate</hi> anſwer if he can.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P. Prelate.</hi> Let no man imagine me to priviledge a King from the<note place="margin">Pag. 65.</note> direction, and juſt power of the Church, or that like <hi>Uzzah</hi> he ſhould intrude upon ſacred actions, exviordinis, in foro interno conſcientiae, to Preach or Adminiſtrate Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Uzzah</hi> did not burn Incenſe, <hi>ex vi ordinis,</hi> as if he had been a Prieſt, but becauſe he was a King, and Gods anointed. Prelates ſit not in Councell and Parliament, <hi>ex vi ordinis,</hi> as tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Lords. The Pope is no temporall Monarch, <hi>ex vi ordinis;</hi> yet
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:119219:221"/>
all are intruders. So the P. P. <hi>will licence Kings</hi> to adminiſter Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, ſo they doe it not <hi>Ex vi ordinis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P. P. Men in ſacred Orders in things intrinſecally ſpirituall, have immediatly a directive and authoritative power, in order, to all what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, although miniſteriall only, as related to Chriſt; but that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them no coercive civill power over the Prince, <hi>perſe,</hi> or <hi>per ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidens,</hi> directly or indirectly, that either the one way or the other, any or many in ſacred Order, Pope, or Presbytery, can cite and cenſure Kings, aſſocîate, Covenant or ſweare to reſiſt him, and force him to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Scepter of Chriſt. This power over man God Almighty uſeth not, much leſſe hath he given it to man, <hi>Pſ. 110.</hi> His people are a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling people, <hi>Suadenda non cogenda religio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſ. 1. <hi>Paſtors have a miniſteriall power</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in ſpirituall</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall power of Paſtors what.</note> 
                  <hi>things, but in order to Chriſt, ergo</hi> in order to others it is not miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, but Lordly. So here a Lordly power Paſtors have over <hi>Kings,</hi> by the <hi>P. P.</hi> way. We teach it is miniſteriall in relation to all, becauſe Miniſters can make no Lawes as Kings can doe, but only as <hi>Heralds,</hi> declare <hi>Chriſts Lawes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. None of us give any coercive Civill power to the Church, over either <hi>Kings,</hi> or any other, it is Eccleſiaſticall; a power to rebuke and cenſure was never civill.</p>
               <p>3. A religious Covenant to ſwear to reſiſt, that is, to defend our ſelves is one thing, and a lawfull Oath, as is cleare in thoſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that did ſweare <hi>Aſa's</hi> Covenant, without the authority of their owne King, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 9, 10, 11, 12. and to ſweare to force the King to ſubmit to <hi>Chriſts</hi> Scepter is another thing; the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery never did ſweare or covenant any ſuch thing: nor doe we take Sacrament upon it, to force the <hi>King.</hi> Prelates have made the King ſweare, and take his Sacrament upon it, that he ſhall roote out Puritanes, that is Proteſtants, whereas he did ſweare athis Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to roote out Heretickes; that is, (if Prelates were not traiterous in adminiſtring the Oath) <hi>Arminians and Papiſts,</hi> ſuch as this P. P. is knowne to be; but I hold that the Eſtates of <hi>Scotland</hi> have power to puniſh the <hi>King,</hi> if he labour to ſubvert Religion and Lawes.</p>
               <p>4. If this Argument, that Religion <hi>is to be perſwaded, not forced, which.</hi> P. P. uſeth, be good, it will make much againſt the <hi>King</hi> for the <hi>King</hi> then can force no man to the externall profeſſion, and uſe of the ordinances of God, and not only Kings, but all the people ſhould be willing.</p>

<pb n="431" facs="tcp:119219:222"/>
The King is priviledged from all Church power. Let the P. P. ſee to it; I ſee no inconvenience for reciprocations of ſubjections in two Supremes; and that they may mutually cenſure and judge one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>

                  <hi>Object.</hi> Not in the ſame cauſe; that is impoſſible. If the King ſay Maſſe, ſhall the Church judge and cenſure the King for intruſion? and becauſe the King is alſo Soveraigne and Supreme in his kinde, he may judge and puniſh the Church for their act of judging and cenſuring the King; it being an intruſion on his prerogative, that any ſhould judge the higheſt Judge.</p>

<pb n="432" facs="tcp:119219:223"/>
this, why they are ſervants in executing Gods will in Diſcipline, and in puniſhing what the Holy Ghoſt by his Apoſtles and Elders de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, when any contemne the Decree concerning the <hi>abſtinence from blood, things ſtrangled, &amp;c.</hi> Act. 15. rather then when they puniſh murther, idolatrie, blaſphemie, which are condemned in the Word preached by Paſtors of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and farther, this objection would have ſome more colour (realitie it hath not) if <hi>Kings</hi> were only to execute what the <hi>Church</hi> miniſterially in Chriſts name, commandeth to be done in Synods: but <hi>Kings</hi> may, and doe command Synods to conveen, and doe their duty, and command many duties never Synodically decreed; as they are to caſt out of their Court apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtare Prelates, ſleeping many yeares in the Devils armes, and are to command Trencher-Divines, neglecting their flock, and lying at Court, attending the falling of a dead Biſhop, as Ravens doe an old dying horſe; To goe and attend the flock, and not the Court, as this <hi>P.

               <p>3.

               </p>
               <p>4. Superſtition maddeth men; but it followeth not, that true Religion may not ſet them on work to defend ſoule and body againſt Tyrannie of the Crown, and Antichriſtian Mitres.</p>

Becauſe what ever Law enjoyneth paſſive obedience no way but by Lawes; that muſt injoyne alſo the King actively to command no other way but by Law: for to be governed by Law, eſſentially includeth, to be governed by the Supreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, only by Law. 2. An act of Regall governing, is an act of Law, and eſſentially an act of Law; an act of abſolute Prerogative is no act of Law, but an act above Law, or of pleaſure looſed from

               </p>
               <p>Theſe two Acts, for my part I acknowledge, ſpoken rather in <hi>Court-expreſſions,</hi> then in <hi>Law-termes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Becauſe perſonall vertues cannot advance a limited Prince (ſuch as the Kings of <hi>Scotland, Poſt hominum memoriam,</hi> ever were) to be an Abſolute Prince: Perſonall graces make not <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> abſolutely <hi>ſupreme Judge over all perſons and cauſes;</hi> nor can King <hi>James,</hi> advanced to be King of <hi>England,</hi> be for that, made more King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and more ſupreme Iudge, then he was, while he was onely King of <hi>Scotland.</hi> A wicked Prince is as eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially ſupreme Iudge, as a godly King.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="436" facs="tcp:119219:225"/>2. If this Parliamentary figure of ſpeech which is to be imputed to the times, exalted King <hi>James</hi> to be Abſolute in <hi>Scotland,</hi> for his perſonall indowments, there was no ground to put the ſame on King <hi>Charls.</hi> Perſonall vertues are not alway Hereditary, though to me the preſent King be the beſt.</p>
               <p>3. There is not any Abſoluteneſſe above Law in the Act. 1. The Parliament muſt be more abſolute themſelves. King <hi>James</hi> 6. had been divers yeers before this 18. Parl. King of <hi>Scotland;</hi> then if they gave him by Law an Abſoluteneſſe, which he had not before, then they were more Abſolute. Theſe who can adde Abſoluteneſſe, muſt have it in themſelves, <hi>Nemo dat quod non habet,</hi> if it be ſaid, <hi>King James had that before the Act, the Parliament legally declared it to be his power, which before the Declaration, was his power.</hi> I anſwer, All he had before this Declaration was, to <hi>govern the people according to Law and Conſcience,</hi> and no more; and if they declare no other Prerogative Royall to be due to him, there is an end, we grant all. But then this which they call <hi>Prerogative Royall</hi> is no more, then, a power to govern according to Law, and ſo you adde nothing to King <hi>James,</hi> upon the ground of his perſonall vertues, onely you make an oration to his praiſe in the <hi>Acts of Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. If this Abſoluteneſſe of Prerogative, be given to the <hi>King,</hi> the ſubjects ſwearing obedience, ſwear, That he hath power from themſelves, to deſtroy themſelves: this is neither a lawfull oath, nor though they ſhould ſwear it, doth it oblige them.</p>
               <p>6. A Supreme Iudge, is a ſupreme father of all his children, and all their cauſes; and to be a ſupreme Father, cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to a ſupreme Iudge: but contrary it muſt be, if this ſupremacy make over to the Prince, a power of devouring as a Lyon, and that by a regall priviledge, and by office, whereas he ſhould be a father to ſave; or if a Iudge kill an ill-doer, though that be an act deſtructive to one man, yet is it an act of a father to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. An act of ſupreme and abſolute <hi>Royaltie</hi> is often an act of deſtruction to one particular man, and to the whole Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. For example, when the King out of his Abſolute Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, pardoneth a murtherer, and he killeth another innocent man, and out of the ſame ground, the King pardoneth him again, and ſo till he kill twenty (for by what reaſon the Prerogative giveth one pardon, he may give twenty, there is a like reaſon above Law for all.) This act of Abſolute <hi>Royaltie,</hi> is ſuch an act of murther, as if
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:119219:225"/>
a ſhepherd would keep a Woolf in the fold with the ſheep, he were guilty of the loſſe of theſe ſheep. Now an act of deſtroying, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be an act of judging, far leſſe of a ſupreme Iudge, but of a ſupreme Murtherer; 7. Whereas he is called <hi>Abſolute Prince, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Judge, in all Cauſes, Eccleſiaſticall and Civill.</hi> It is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, 1. That the Eſtates profeſſe in theſe acts, not to give any<note place="margin">How the King is ſupreme Iudge in all Cauſes.</note> new Prerogative, but onely to continue the old power, and that onely with that amplitude, and freedom, which the King and his Predeceſſors did enjoy and exerce of before: the extent whereof, is beſt known from the Acts of Parliament, Hiſtories of the time, and the Oaths of the Kings of <hi>Scotland.</hi> 2. That he is called Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Prince, not in any relation <hi>of freedom, from Law, or Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive above Law;</hi> whereunto as unto the <hi>norma, regula, ac menſura poteſtatis ſuae, ac ſubjectionis meae,</hi> He is tyed by the Fundamentall Law, and his own Oath, but in oppoſition to all forraign Iuriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or principalitie above him, as is evident, by the Oath of <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie</hi> ſet down, for acknowledging of his power in the firſt Act of Parliament 21.

So the <hi>King</hi> cannot judge in all Eccleſiaſticall Cauſes, that is, he cannot, <hi>Quoad actos elicitos,</hi> preſcribe this Worſhip: for example, the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> not the <hi>Sacrament of the Lords Supper.</hi> Therefore the <hi>King</hi> hath but <hi>Actus imperatos,</hi> ſome Royall Politicall Acts about the Worſhip of God to command <hi>God</hi> to be Worſhipped according to his Word, to puniſh the ſuperſtitions or neglectors of Divine Worſhip; therefore cannot the King be ſole Iudge in matters that belong to the Colledge of Iudges by the Lawes of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Lords of Seſſion onely may judge theſe maters.

And further we affirme, that whoſoever denyeth unto them aide, their counſell and comfort, while as the Princes and Rulers vigilantly travell in execution of their Office, that the ſame men deny their helpe, ſupport and counſell to God, who by the preſence of his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant craves it of them.</hi> From which words we have cleare:</p>
               <p>1. That to <hi>reſiſt the King</hi> or Parliament, is to reſiſt them, <hi>while as they</hi> are <hi>doing the thing that appertaineth to their charge, and while they vigilantly travell in the execution of their office.</hi> But while King and Parliament doe acts of Tyranny againſt Gods Law, and all good Lawes of men, they doe not the things that <hi>appertaine to their charge and the execution of their Office;</hi> ergo by our confeſſion, to reſiſt them in Tyrannicall acts is, not to reſiſt the ordinance of God.</p>
               <p>2. To <hi>reſiſt Princes and Rulers, and ſo inferious Iudges, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them counſell and comfort, is to deny helpe, counſell, and comfort to God.</hi> Let then <hi>Cavaliers,</hi> and ſuch as refuſe to helpe the Princes of the Land againſt <hi>Papiſts, Prelates,</hi> and <hi>Malignants</hi> know, that they reſiſt <hi>Gods ordinance,</hi> which rebellion they unjuſtly impute to us.</p>
               <p>3. Whereas it is added in our Confeſſion, that <hi>God by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Lieutenant craveth ſupport and counſell of the people.</hi> It is not ſo to be taken, as if then only we are to ayde and helpe inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Iudges and <hi>Parliaments,</hi> when the <hi>King</hi> perſonally requireth it, and not other waies.</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe the <hi>King</hi> requireth helpe, when by his Office he is obliged to require our helpe and counſell againſt Papiſts and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants, though as miſled, he ſhould command the contrary: ſo if the Law require our helpe, the <hi>King</hi> requireth it <hi>ex officio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. This ſhould expreſly contradict our confeſſion, if none were
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:119219:228"/>
obliged to give helpe and counſell to the <hi>Parliament</hi> and Eſtates, except the <hi>King</hi> in his own perſon ſhould require it, becauſe Art. 14. it is expreſly ſaid, That to <hi>ſave the lives of innocents, or repreſſe Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, to defend the oppreſſed,—not to ſuffer innocent blood to be ſhed;</hi> or <hi>workes pleaſing to God, which he rewardeth.</hi> Now we are not to thinke in reaſon, if the <hi>King</hi> ſhall be induced by wicked Counſell, to doe tyrannicall workes, and to raiſe Papiſts in Armes againſt Proteſtants, that <hi>God</hi> doth <hi>by him as</hi> by his Lieutenant, require our helpe, comfort and counſell, in aſſiſting the <hi>King</hi> in acts of Tyranny, and in oppreſſion, and in ſhedding innocent blood; yea our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion tyeth us to deny helpe and comfort to the King in theſe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked acts, and therefore our helpe muſt be in the things that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to his Royall Office, and duty only; otherwiſe we are to <hi>repreſſe all tyranny,</hi> art 14.</p>
               <p>4 <hi>To ſave the lives of innocents, to repreſſe Tyranny, to defend the oppreſſed,</hi> are by our confeſſion good workes, well pleaſing to <hi>God,</hi> and ſo is this a good worke, <hi>not to ſuffer innocent blood to be ſhed, if we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>1. It is a wonder that inferiour Judges ſhould be formally Iudges, in ſo far as they act conforme to the will of a mortall King, and not in ſo far as they act conforme to the will of the King of Kings, ſeeing the judgement they execute is the King of Kings, and not the Iudgement of a mortall King, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 19. 6.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Royaliſts</hi> cannot indure the former diſtinction as it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the King, but they receive it with both hands, as it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to inferiour Iudges; and yet certaine it is, that it is as ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary for a King being a ſinfull man, to act ſometimes as the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of God, and ſometimes as an erring and misinformed man, no leſſe then the inferiour Iudge acteth ſometimes according to the Kings will and Law, and ſometimes according to his owne private way; and if we are to obey the inferiour Iudge as the Deputy of the King, what ſhall become of his Perſon, when Cavaliers may kill him at ſome <hi>Edge-hill?</hi> for ſo they mock this diſtinction, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the King in regard of his Perſon, and of his Royall Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and for this point our Confeſſion citeth in the Margin. <hi>Rom. 13. 7. 1 Pet. 2. 17.

               <p>All Polititians ſay, The King is a limited Prince, not abſolute; where the King giveth out Lawes, not in his own name, but in the name of himſelfe, and the Eſtates judicially conveened.</p>

               <p>QUeſt. 1. <hi>Whether all Governments be but broken Governments, and deviations from Monarchie?] Anſw.</hi> It is denyed; There is no leſſe ſomewhat of <hi>Gods</hi> authoritie in Government, by many, or ſome of the choiſeſt of the People, than in <hi>Monarchie:</hi> nor can we judge any <hi>Ordinance of Man</hi> unlawfull: for we are to be <hi>ſubject to all, for the Lords ſake,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 13.

               <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>Whether is Royaltie an immediate iſſue and ſpring of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</hi>]<note place="margin">How Royaltie is the firſt and naturall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> 
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No; For man, fallen in ſinne, knowing naturally he hath need of a Law and a Government, could have, by reaſon, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed Governors, one or moe; and the ſupervenient inſtitution of <hi>God,</hi> comming upon this Ordinance, doth more fully aſſure us, that <hi>God,</hi> for mans good, hath appointed Governours: but if we conſult with Nature, many Iudges and Governors, to fallen Nature, ſeeme nearer of blood, to Nature, then one only: for two, becauſe of mans weakneſſe, are better then one. Now Nature ſeemeth, to me, not to teach, that one onely ſinfull man ſhould be the ſole and onely Ruler
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:119219:234"/>
of a whole Kingdome. <hi>God,</hi> in his Word, ever joyned with the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme<note place="margin">Many Rulers over a great multitude, more naturall than one.</note> Ruler, many Rulers, who, as touching the eſſence of a Iudge, (which is, to rule for <hi>God</hi>) were all equally Iudges: ſome reſerved Acts, or a longer cubite of power, in regard of extent, being due to the <hi>King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queſt. 3. <hi>Whether Magiſtrates, as Magiſtrates, be naturall?] Anſw.</hi> Nature is conſidered, as whole and ſinleſſe, or as fallen and broken. In the former conſideration, that either man ſhould ſtand in need of any, to compell him with the ſword to doe his duty, and not oppreſſe; was no more naturall to man, than to ſtand in need of <hi>Lictors</hi> and <hi>Hangmen,</hi> or <hi>Phyſitians</hi> for the body, which in this ſtate was not in a capacitie of ſickneſſe or death: And ſo Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Parents and Husbands was only naturall, in the latter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> as <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> are two wayes conſidered; 1. According to the knowledge of ſuch an Ordinance; 2. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the actuall erection of the practice of the office of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates. In the former notion, I humbly conceive, that by Natures light, Man, now fallen and broken, even under all the fractions of the powers and faculties of the ſoule, doth know, that promiſes of reward, feare of puniſhment, and the coactive power of the Sword, as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid, are naturall meanes to move us, and wings to promote obedience, and to doe our duty. And that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> is naturall: But, in the ſecond relation, it is hard to determine, that Kings, rather then other Governours, are more naturall.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 4. <hi>Whether Nature hath determined, that there ſhould be one ſupreme Ruler a King, or many Rulers in a free Commnitie? Anſw.</hi> It is denyed.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 6. <hi>Whether every free Commonwealth hath not in it a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie of Majeſtie, which it may formally place in one, or many?] Anſw.</hi> It is affirmed.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 6. <hi>Whether abſolute and unlimited power of Royaltie, be a ray and beame of Divine Majeſtie, immediately derived from God?] Anſw.</hi> Not at all: Such a creature is not in the world of <hi>Gods</hi> cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation: Royaliſts, and flatterers of Kings, are parents to this prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious birth. There is no ſhadow of power, to doe ill, in <hi>God:</hi> An abſolute power is, eſſentially, a power to do without or above Law, and a power to doe ill, to deſtroy: and ſo it cannot come from <hi>God,</hi> as a Morall power, by inſtitution; though it come from God by a
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:119219:235"/>
flux of permiſſive providence: but ſo things unlawfull and ſinfull come from God.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 7. <hi>Whether the King may, in his actions, intend his owne Prerogative and Abſolutenes?] Anſw.</hi> He can neither intend it as his neareſt end, nor as his remote end. Not the former: for if he fight, and deſtroy his People for a <hi>Prerogative,</hi> he deſtroyeth his People, that he may have a power to deſtroy them, which muſt be meere Tyranny, nor can it be his remote end; for granting that his ſuppoſed abſolute Prerogative were lawfull, he is to referre all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Power, and all his actions to a more noble end, to wit, to the ſafetie and good of the People.<note place="margin">To reſiſt the Will, is not to reſiſt the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Queſt. 8. <hi>Doe not they that reſiſt the Parliaments power, reſiſt the Parliament? And they that reſiſt the Kings power, reſiſt the King? God hath joyned King and Power: who dare ſeperate them?] Anſw.</hi> If the <hi>Parliament</hi> abuſe their power, we may reſiſt their<note place="margin">Pag. 9.</note> abuſed power, and not their power Parliamentarie. Mr. <hi>Bridges</hi> doth well diſtinguiſh, in his Annot. on the [<hi>Loyall Convert</hi>] be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Kings power,</hi> and the <hi>Kings will.</hi> 2. The Reſiſters doe not ſeparate <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Power;</hi> but the <hi>King</hi> himſelfe doth ſeparate his lawfull Power from his Will, if he worke and act Tyrannie, out of this principle, Will, Paſſion, Luſt; not out of the Royall princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Kingly power: So far we may reſiſt the one, and not the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 9. <hi>Why, if God might work a miracle in the three Childrens reſiſtance active; why doth he evidence omnipotencie in the paſſive obedience of theſe Witneſſes? The Kingdome of Iudah was Chriſts birthright, as man, and Davids ſonne: why did he not, by legions of Men &amp; Angels, rather vindicate his own fleſh and blood, than triumph by non-reſiſtance, and the omnipotencie of glorie to ſhine in his meere ſuffering?] Anſ. Who art thou that diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt with God?</hi> He that killeth with the <hi>jaw-bone of an Aſſe, thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">It is no good conſequence: Chriſt and the Apoſtles uſed not violent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to ſpread the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, <hi>ergo,</hi> ſuch reſiſtance is unlawfull.</note> and he that deſtroyed the numberleſſe <hi>Midianites</hi> by <hi>only three hundred,</hi> ſhould no more put the three Children to an unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fact in the one, if they had by three men killed <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and all his Subjects, than in the other. But nothing is ſaid againſt us in a Sophiſme <hi>à non-cauſa pro cauſa;</hi> except it be proved, <hi>God</hi> would neither deliver his <hi>three Children,</hi> nor <hi>Chriſt</hi> from death, and the Iewes from bondage, by miraculous reſiſtance, becauſe reſiſtance is unlawfull. What? patient ſuffring is lawfull; <hi>Ergo</hi> reſiſtance is
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:119219:235"/>
unlawfull. It is a poor conſequent, and a begging of the queſtion, both muſt be lawfull to us. And ſo we hold, of ten lawfull meanes fit to compaſſe <hi>Gods</hi> bleſſed end, he may chooſe one, and let goe nine: ſhall any inferre, <hi>ergo,</hi> Theſe other nine meanes are unlawfull, becauſe <hi>God</hi> choſe a mean, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Becauſe it ſhould be more honour to God, if they had, by ſuffering patiently the ſword of <hi>Midian,</hi> glorified <hi>God</hi> in Martyrdome. So <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who could have wrought miracles, might have wrought Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the ſword, and deſtroyed <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Emperors,</hi> the oppoſers of the <hi>Lambe:</hi> and they did reforme by ſuffering; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the ſword is unlawfull in Reformation. It followeth not. The meane <hi>Chriſt</hi> uſed, is lawfull; <hi>Ergo,</hi> all other meanes that he uſed not, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, It is vaine Logick.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 10. <hi>Whether is the Coronation of a King any other thing but a Ceremonie?] Anſ.</hi> In the <hi>Coronation</hi> there is, and may be, the<note place="margin">The Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the King, <hi>in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creto,</hi> is more then a <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie.</hi>

                  <hi>Ceremonie of a ſhout</hi> and an Acclamation, and the reaching of a Scepter in his right hand who is made <hi>King;</hi> and the like: But the Coronation <hi>in concreto,</hi> according to the ſubſtance of the act, is no <hi>Ceremonie,</hi> nor any accidentall ingredient in the conſtitution of a <hi>King;</hi> 1. Becauſe <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould have performed a meere ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all action on <hi>Saul,</hi> when they made him <hi>King,</hi> which we cannot ſay: for as the Peoples act of <hi>Coronation</hi> is diſtinctive, ſo is it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive; it diſtinguiſhed <hi>Saul</hi> from all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and did conſtitute him in a new relation, that he was changed from no <hi>King,</hi> to be a <hi>King.</hi> 2. The people cannot by a <hi>Ceremonie</hi> make a <hi>King;</hi> they muſt really put ſome honour on him, that was not on him before.
