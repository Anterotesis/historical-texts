            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Or the Frozen Age: Or the Metamorphosis of
the Riuer of Thames. 1621.</head>
            <l>IT was the time when men wore liquor'd bootes,</l>
            <l>When rugged Winter, murdred hearbes &amp; rootes:</l>
            <l>When as the Heauens, the Earth did all attire</l>
            <l>With plashes, puddles, pooles, blacke dirt &amp; mire.</l>
            <l>Then at that time (to poore mens care and costs)</l>
            <l>A Christmas came to Towne, betwixt two Frosts.</l>
            <l>Then in the num Colde month of <hi>Ianuary,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>When as the Sunne was lodg'd in moyst <hi>Aquary:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>When <hi>Boreas</hi> (all with Isickles bedight)</l>
            <l>Worse then a Barber, 'gan to shaue and bite,</l>
            <l>Turning <hi>Thames</hi> streames, to hard congealed flakes,</l>
            <l>And pearled water drops to Christall cakes.</l>
            <l>Th'adulterate Earth, long hauing play'd the whore,</l>
            <l>In bearing and in breeding bastards store,</l>
            <l>As Drunkards, swearers, leachers, Cheating knaues,</l>
            <l>Punkes, Panders, base extortionizing slanes,</l>
            <l>Rent-raising rascals, Villaines, Theeues, Oppressors,</l>
            <l>Vainglorious proude fooles, Gen'rall all transgressors,</l>
            <l>For which foule whordome, Heauen did think it meet,</l>
            <l>To make the Earth doe pennance in a<note n="*" place="margin">The Snow.</note> sheet.</l>
            <l>That punishment no sooner past and gon,</l>
            <l>But straight a Colde freeze coate she did put on.</l>
            <l>Which (though herselfe were senceles, what she ayles)</l>
            <l>It made her poorest bastards blowe their nayles.</l>
            <l>Whilst many of her Rich broode did agree,</l>
            <l>To make their stony hearts as hard as shee.</l>
            <l>The liquid <hi>Thames</hi> each where from shore to shore,</l>
            <l>With colde bak'd Paste, all pastycrusted o're.</l>
            <l>When in a Month no Waterman could share,</l>
            <l>The single benefit of halfe his Fare;</l>
            <l>When a whole Tearme would not affoord a Boate,</l>

            <l>But all his Conscience wayted on his Fee:</l>
            <l>He walk'd along, and look'd a scaunt on her,</l>
            <l>And put his bounty off with a demurre.</l>
            <l>The third a Broker<note n="*" place="margin">An vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable Broker.</note>, a base Houndsditch hound,</l>
            <l>That euery Month takes Eight-pence in the pound:</l>
            <l>He look'd on <hi>Charity,</hi> but nothing threw her,</l>
            <l>And vow'd that all his Life, he neuer knew her.</l>
            <l>A world of people more did thrust and throng,</l>
            <l>Yet none Relieu'd her as they past along:</l>
            <l>Vntill at last (as she was like to Dye)</l>
            <l>The Maisters of an Hospitall past by<note n="*" place="margin">Too good to bee true.</note>;</l>
            <l>They stay'd, and did compassionate her Case,</l>
            <l>And straight prouided her a Lodging place.</l>
            <l>There was a Vs'rer<note n="*" place="margin">Too true to bee good.</note>, with his Purse fast shut,</l>
            <l>Did rayle at her and call'd her Idle slut:</l>
            <l>And said she to <hi>Virginia</hi> should be Shipt,</l>
            <l>Or to <hi>Bridewell</hi> be sent, and soundly whipt.</l>
            <l>But at the last (to many a mizers Griefe)</l>
            <l>Shee in an Hospitall did finde Reliefe:</l>
            <l>And whether shee be dead, or like to dye,</l>
            <l>Those that Relieue her better know then I.</l>
            <l>But once againe, Ile turne me to my Theame,</l>
            <l>Of the conglutinated Frozen streame:</l>
            <l>Vpon whose Glassie face both too and fro,</l>
            <l>Fiue hundred people all at onee did goe.</l>
            <l>At <hi>Westminster</hi> there went three Horses ouer</l>
            <l>Which safely did from shore to shore recouer,</l>
            <l>There might be seene spic'd Cakes, and roasted Pigs,</l>
            <l>Beere, Ale, Tobacco, Apples, Nuts, and Figs,</l>
            <l>Fires made of Char-coles, Faggots, and Sea-coles,</l>
            <l>Playing and couz'ning at the Pidg'on-holes:</l>
            <l>Some, for two Pots at Tables, Cards, or Dice:</l>
            <l>Some slipping in betwixt two Cakes of<note n="*" place="margin">Witnesse my selfe.</note> Ice:</l>
            <l>Some going on their businesse and affaires,</l>
            <l>From the Bank-side to Pauls, or to Trig-staires.</l>
            <l>And some there were (which I almost forgot)</l>
            <l>That thought the frozen streames were too too hot,</l>
            <l>'Twas safer for them (they did vnderstand)</l>
            <l>To walke vpon the water then the land.</l>
            <l>Some trod the Thames as boldly as the ground,</l>
            <l>Knowing their fortunes was not to be drownd.</l>
            <l>And sure the honest Riuer is so true,</l>
            <l>It will not rob the Gallowes of his due.</l>
            <l>The Begger's follow'd men in troopes and flockes,</l>
            <l>And neuer fear'd the Constable or Stockes,</l>
            <l>The Cage, and whipping-post were idle bables,</l>
            <l>And lawes they count no more then <hi>Esops</hi> fables.</l>
            <l>This was a time when th'weakest went to'th'wall,</l>
            <l>When hackney Coaches got the deuill and all.</l>
            <l>Though thousands others want and sorrow seeles,</l>
            <l>Yet still with them the world did runne on wheeles.</l>
            <l>And sure more Coaches and Carroches,<note place="margin">A running whirling time.</note> went</l>
            <l>In one day to the Tearme and Parlament:</l>
            <l>Then there past Wherries in a month and more,</l>
            <l>'Twixt <hi>Essex, Middl'sex, Kent</hi> and <hi>Surry</hi> shore.</l>
            <l>And though for two mon'ths time, that fell together,</l>
            <l>Of Windes, Raine, Snow, and bitter Frosty wether.</l>
            <l>Though Water-men for number multiplies,</l>
            <l>Neere twenty thousand with their families;</l>
            <l>Yet this vnto their praise I'le truly speake,</l>
            <l>(Though many of their states are meane and weake)</l>
            <l>All this hard time,<note place="margin">Truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst poore men is more rare, then honesty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the rich.</note> not one amongst them all,</l>
            <l>Did to dishonesty, or theeuing fall;</l>
            <l>Therefore this commendations is their due,</l>
            <l>Though they are poore men, yet they still are true.</l>
            <l>I doubt not but a many Trades there bee,</l>
            <l>That hold their heads more higher farre then we.</l>
            <l>Yet if but eight weekes they had such poore dealing,</l>
            <l>They would fall neere to begg'ry, or to stealing.</l>
            <l>I dare affirme, that Water-men this Frost</l>
            <l>(Amongst them) twenty thousand pounds haue lost:</l>
            <l>And all that losse of theirs, was no mans gaine,</l>
            <l>But toyle and dirt by land, with cost and paine.</l>
            <l>And Gentlemen, as glad of Boates there are,</l>
            <l>As Water men will be to haue a fare.</l>
            <l>Thus was this Tearme, worse then the worst vacation,</l>
            <l>To those that vse a watry Occupation;</l>
            <l>Whilst Trades by land did dayly purse vp Chinke,</l>
            <l>Bakers for bread, and Brewers for their drinke:</l>
            <l>Tapsters for Pots and Cans, with nick and froath,</l>
            <l>Mercers for Stuffes, and Drapers for their Cloath:</l>
            <l>Vintners for drunken heads, Cutlers for swords;</l>
            <l>Sergeants for Fees, and Lawyers for good words:</l>
            <l>And in this gnashing age of Snow and Ice,</l>
            <l>The Wood-mongers did mount so high their price:</l>
            <l>That many did to lye a bed desire,</l>
            <l>To saue the charge of Wood, and Cole, and Fire.</l>
            <l>Amongst the Whores there were hot commings in,</l>

            <l>And what the neede of nature did require.</l>
            <l>So farewell Frost, if <hi>Charity</hi> be liuing,</l>
            <l>Poore men shall finde it, by the rich mens giuing.</l>
