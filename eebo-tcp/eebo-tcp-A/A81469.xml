            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

which are dearer to him then his Life, are indeavour'd by this wicked
and falſe Declaration (made by the Houſe of Commons) to be blaſted, and
Himſelf rendred to His people and to Poſterity, the moſt odious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable
of Men, and the moſt tyrannicall of Kings, whilſt He himſelf is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in cloſe priſon, and in likelyhood kept ignorant of what is ſaid, or
working againſt Him; Or if He (for His further vexation) have notice of
what He is accuſed, all meanes of clearing Himſelf, and vindicating. His
honour are debarred Him; His Papers of the Tranſaction of Affaires
kept from Him; the acceſſe of any of His Secretaries, or His Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
or Counſell of Law not admitted.</p>
            <p>The Houſes when they impeach the moſt capitall Offenders even of
high Treaſon, in ſuch Caſes the ſuppoſed Delinquents are allowed Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts
of their Accuſations, Counſell in the point of Law, and a convenient
time for the publiſhing of their Anſwer; and this was afforded unto the
<hi>Earle of Strafford,</hi> the <hi>Arch-Biſhop of Canterbury,</hi> and is now to the <hi>ſix Lords</hi>
impeached of high Treaſon; &amp; is a Juſtice not denyed to Traitors &amp; Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers?
But how it can be afforded to the King, I cannot ſee, ſince He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
can make no addreſſe whereby to obtain it, and no man elſe may upon
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:117629:5"/>
Paine of death make any Addreſſe unto him to receive his directions.</p>
            <p>This certainly may be a ſufficient motive to any man, nay to all men, as
it hath been to me, in this diſtreſſe and oppreſſion of the King, to ſet down
what is in their knowledge and reaſon toward the confuting of thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
Aſperſions caſt upon him by this Declaration, untill God ſhall give
the King means by his own full and perfect Anſwer to blow back the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous
and infectious vapours into the faces of that prevalent Party (that
with Art and Terrour carried this Declaration) to their perpetuall infamy
and ſhame: And in the interim, I ſhall deſire that this may be received
but onely as a preparative to keep the mindes of men from being too much
carried away with one ſtory untill the other Tale be told.</p>
            <p>THe Scope of this Declaration is expreſſed to be, to ſet down the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
for theſe enſuing Reſolutions.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That they will make no farther Addreſſes nor Applications to the King.</item>
               <item>2. That no Application nor Addreſſes be made to the King by any Perſon
whatſoever, without the leave of both Houſes.</item>
               <item>3. That they will receive no more any Meſſage from the King, &amp; do enjoyn
that to Perſon whatſoever do preſume to receive, or bring any Meſſage from the
King to both or either Houſe of Parliament, or to any other Perſon.</item>
               <item>4. That the Perſon or Perſons that ſhall make breach of this Order, ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
the Penalties of high Treaſon.</item>
            </list>
            <p>So that it may be juſtly expected that this Declaration ſhall lay down
unto the people whom they intend to ſatisfie, ſuch Reaſons as may juſtifie
the ſaid Votes, with the Conſequences and proceedings thereupon.</p>
            <p>And the way to make plaine the ſtrength of their Argument, is, to ſet it
down plainly, which muſt run thus;</p>
            <p>A King having committed thoſe crimes which are ſet down in this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
the Houſes may remove from the Government, impriſon Him,
and debar all Addreſſes to him and from him, as they have done.</p>
            <p>But King CHARLS hath committed theſe crimes; and ſo the Houſes
may proceed againſt Him, as they have done.</p>
            <p>When a clear Anſwer ſhall be made unto this Argument, the debate will
be brought unto a ſhorter iſſue, and the people before whom the ſeene now
lieth, will have an eaſie way to frame a Judgement, whether they ought to
be ſatisfied with the proceeding of the Houſes, [as is pretended by this
Declaration,] or whether they ſhall not have juſt cauſe to deteſt and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
both their Declaration and their Proceedings.</p>
            <p>The Anſwer briefly is, That both Propoſitions are falſe; The firſt, that
a King doing thoſe things laid down in this Declaration may be removed
from the Government, impriſon'd, &amp;c. by the Houſes.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, That King <hi>Charls</hi> hath done the things alleadged in this
Declaration; But becauſe the ſecond Propoſition is that which this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
endeavours cheifly to infer and make good, This Anſwer ſhall
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117629:5"/>
firſt inſiſt upon the truth or falſehood of the matters of fact; viz. <hi>Whether
the King have done the things ſuggeſted?</hi> And afterward ſhew briefly, the
Impiety, danger, and Treaſonableneſſe of the firſt; viz. <hi>That ſubjects may
upon Suggeſtions, if true as they are falſe, depoſe their King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE entrance into this Declaration is in theſe Words; <hi>How fruitleſſe
our former Addreſſes have been to the King, is well known unto the World.</hi>
It is willingly left unto the Judgement of the World to whom they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,
whether the Addreſſes of the Houſes [whilſt their Addreſſes were
made unto the King in ſuch dutifull and ſober manner as Subjects, yea even
the Houſes themſelves ought to addreſſe themſelves unto their King] were
fruitleſſe, when ſo many things have by the King been this Parliament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended
unto, as have enforced them to acknowledge in ſome of their
Publike Declarations, That the King hath granted more for the liberty and
eaſe of his people, then had been granted by any of his Predeceſſors; I think
with truth it might have been ſaid, then all of them; and it will not be amiſs
to ſet down ſome of them; The high Court of Star-Chamber; The high
Commiſſion, and five Courts more of Juſtice, all eſtabliſhed by Law (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be for the eaſe of the people, but apparently much to the leſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Authority of the Crown) have been wholly aboliſhed; an Act
for a trienniall Parliament; another for the taking away of the Kings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
Power of diſſolving this, without the Conſent of the Houſes; an
Act for regulating the power of the Councel Table, according to their own
deſires; an Act for the taking away the Biſhops Votes in Parliament; an
Act for the bounding and limiting of Forreſts; others for the reſtraining
of the King to lay Impoſitions, to levy Tonnage and Poundage,
or to Preſſe Souldiers without conſent of Parliament. All theſe with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more have been <hi>the fruits of their former addreſſes unto the King;</hi> And
now if they finde any ſtop or refuſall in what they propound, it is not for
that the Kings inclination and readineſs to gratifie his people is leſſened or
alter'd; but it is that they have altered their mannerly and dutifull wayes of
their Addreſſes, and now will force by Armes and Victories what they had
wont to petition for. And for the matters deſired, whereas before there
was in them a pretence of the Kings honour and ſafety, and of the Subjects
eaſe and liberty, in the Propoſitions now inſiſted upon, it is cleerly apparent,
That the King is by them unthroned; The Soveraignty taken from Him,
and placed in themſelves; And the Subject (which if they would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
themſelves with the above ſpecified Conceſſions, ſhould have been
the happieſt and freeſt people of all the Subjects in Chriſtendom) ſhall (if
the King ſhould condeſcend to their late demands) become Slaves in their
Liberties, Lives, and Properties, by being left to the arbitrary and lawleſs
Power of them, their fellow Subjects; and this is ſo beleived by all men but
themſelves and their Adherents, even by their brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which
hath adminiſtred unto them juſt grounds of their diſſenting from them; as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117629:6"/>
ſhall be made apparent before this diſcourſe be ended.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whereas they ſay next, That</hi> they could not have confidence that words
ſhould prevaile more with Him then Sighs and Groanes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let the world judge whether theſe men at eaſe and inveſted with all
Power and Authority, are more likely to be moved with ſighs and groans,
cries of Fathers, &amp; Mothers, &amp; Children, &amp;c. or the King who is debarr'd
the ſociety of the Queen his moſt dear Wife; his Children baniſh'd or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
reſtraint; His Friends ruin'd, deſtroyed, and perſecuted; and ſome for
their love and Loyalty to His Perſon, hang'd, drawn, and quarter'd; and
all in danger of it, that ſhall in any ſort indeavour to ſerve him; Himſelfe
diveſted of all manner of comfort either for His body or Soul; beſides the
tender ſenſe that he muſt needs have of the miſeries of his people: muſt
not the World conclude the King not only to be void of all naturall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and all bowels of compaſſion, both towards Himſelf, and all that
are neareſt and deareſt unto Him, but to want alſo common ſenſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
if He ſhould not imbrace all meanes that with honour and
conſcience He might, for the ſpeedieſt ſettlement of the diſtracted and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
condition of himſelf, and His Kingdomes?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is then ſaid, that</hi> they were never forced to any Treaty, and yet they have
made ſeven times application to the King, notwithſtanding their great ſucceſs in
overthrowing all His forces, ſo that he fled in diſguiſe to the Scots.</p>
            <p>It is true, that they ſo well laid their buſineſſe, that at the firſt they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
themſelves of the power of all the Kingdom both by ſea and land;
of the City of <hi>London;</hi> and of the Kings Cuſtoms; of his Revenue; of His
Magazins; and of the abuſed hearts of his people; whereas the King wanting
every thing but a good cauſe, hath from the beginning only ſtruggled to
ſubſiſt: But let not Succeſſe againſt the King be vanted of; Succeſſe is not
alwaies a Proof of a good Cauſe, God hath often puniſh'd his Church by
the power of Infidels, and made wicked men the Scourge wherewith he
hath chaſtiſed his Children, and then caſt the rod into the fire, and lifted up
the heads of his afflicted Servants.</p>
            <p>Whereas they ſay, <hi>That they have made 7. times applications unto the King
for Peace,</hi> Their own conſciences (I mean ſo many of them as have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
the Curtain) do tell them, That ſo many times they have offended
God, and abuſed the World with deteſtable Hypocriſie, by making ſhew
of that which was never in their thoughts: And all the ſaid Treaties which
they ſpeak of, were ever with thoſe unreaſonable, unconſcionable, &amp; diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Propoſitions, that they well knew that their Intentions of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
of a War could run no hazard by ſuch Propoſals for Peace; yet who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
ſhall peruſe all thoſe ſeverall Treaties which are with great exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ſet down in their own Books (and printed by their own Order) of
Exact Collections, will to be able judge of the difference of Spirits then
walking; In them inſtead of Reaſons, it will be found that improbable fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117629:6"/>
fears and jealouſies, and the advantage of their preſent Condition, have
been the ground of their Propoſals; And on His Majeſties part there will
be clearly ſeen, a bowing and ſtretching to a Compliance with them, to the
utmoſt that could ſtand with his Conſcience, Safety, and Honour: To theſe
Volumes of theirs, I refer the Reader, that ſeeing both ſides, he may frame
unto himſelfe a Judgement where the fault lies, if their Addreſſes have
been fruitleſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To countenance no more their former Treaties, and the Conditions
propoſed in them, they further ſay,</hi> That in all their former Addreſſes the
Commiſſioners of <hi>Scotland</hi> agreed with them, and joyned with their Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
in attending the King.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In which Affirmation they do not uſe the ingenuity and clearneſs which
the Houſe hath in former Parliaments uſed to do, in that which they pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
unto the Kingdom; for although it be true, that the Commiſſioners
of</hi> Scotland <hi>agreed to the ſending of the Propoſitions unto the King at</hi>
Newcaſtle, <hi>yet in their publike printed Declaration of their ſaid conſent,
bearing date the 25. of</hi> June 1646. <hi>they declare their want of ſatisfaction in
many particulars; in ſo much as they ſay, That</hi> ſome of the particulars are
inconſiſtent with the word of God, and others wherein they remain unſatisfied: yet
notwithſtanding ſo great was their deſire to ſee an end of this bloody war, &amp; the
eaſing of thoſe heavy preſſures under which both the Kingdoms groaned, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thoſe Conſiderations they conſented to many materiall parts of thoſe Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
&amp; to make no let, but to give way to the ſending of ſuch other particulars, as
they were ſtill unſatisfied in the matter, for the reaſons formerly preſented in their
Papers unto the Houſes. <hi>And this their Aſſent they declare to be with ſeveral
proviſo's, as will appear by their ſaid Anſwer; The laſt of which, is, that</hi> it is
not their Judgement that every particular of theſe Propoſitions is of ſo great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
to the Kingdoms, that Peace and War ſhould depend thereupon.</p>
            <p>Now let it be impartially judged, whether it be an ingenious manner of
proceeding, to ſet down a perfect conſent, &amp; to conceal the conditions, and
proviſo's, upon the which the <hi>Scots</hi> declare their conſent, is grounded.</p>
            <p>But that which is moſt remarkable concerning the <hi>Scots,</hi> is, that having
thus artificially inſinuated to the people their former concurrence with
them, now when they make their Declaration to the Kingdome, for the
ſtating truly of the whole buſineſſe, and the reaſon for having no more
to do with the King, grounded upon the Kings laſt Anſwer concerning the
four Bils, they remember not in this their finall Declaration, the diſſent
of the <hi>Scots;</hi> nor their unanſwerable Reaſons for their ſaid diſſent; nor the
Proteſtations of the ſaid <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> delivered unto the King in the name
of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> declaring their diſſent to thoſe Propoſitions;
for the not yeilding whereunto, the King is not only by theſe Votes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
in effect, and another government without Him ſet up by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
but His Royall Perſon uſed with greater ſeverity, &amp; inhumanity, then
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117629:7"/>
theeves, and murderers are in the common gaols; for to them it is permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to have the comfort of Phyſitians for the body, and of Divines for
their ſouls, whereas to the King there is no meanes left to aske them.</p>
            <p>The reaſon why they conceal this diſſent of the <hi>Scots,</hi> is, for that they
would have the Kings refuſall of the Bils, to be aſcribed only to his <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe,</hi>
and to his <hi>perſiſting in his wonted wayes</hi> (as they call it;) but would
not have the people thinke that the King had many of his mind; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
if the truth might appear, it would be found, that few beſides that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
party in the lower Houſe, and Army, with the Sectaries depending
on them, that hold not their Propoſitions moſt unreaſonable, and their
uſage of the King moſt deteſtable.</p>
            <p>Further, if the former aſſent, and concurrence of the <hi>Scots</hi> with them,
be uſed as an argument for the countenancing, and better juſtifying of their
former Treatiſe and Propoſitions; their preſent diſſent, and their unanſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
reaſons ſet down in their Declaration againſt the four Bils, againſt
their deniall of the King a Perſonall Treaty, and againſt his want of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
together with their ſolemn Proteſtation grounded upon them, in the
name of the whole Kingdome, ought in reaſon at leaſt to put a ſtand upon
mens judgements untill all tales be told; and not be carried away by a
Declaration of the ſingle Houſe of Commons, without the concurrance
of the Peers; and not paſſed unanimouſly in that Houſe, but by the power
of a prevalent party.</p>
            <p>For whoſoever ſhall conſider the former brotherhood, and ſtrict union
betwixt the Houſes and the <hi>Scots;</hi> and how ſubſervient they have been
unto them, and their affaires; how they have twice entred this Kingdom,
The firſt time by their invitement, The ſecond time by their moſt earneſt
ſolicitation and hire; and how the <hi>Scots</hi> chooſe rather the adherence to
them, then unto their owne native King; how far they gratifie them by
delivery of him into their hands; and how they were become brothers in
Intereſts, in Armes, in Covenant; whoſoever ſhall conſider this ſtrict
conjunction, cannot but thinke that the <hi>Scots</hi> have ſome great reaſon of
Conſcience, Intereſt, and Honour, for their preſent deſerting of them in
theſe their new demands, and rigorous way of proceeding with the King.</p>
            <p>The nation hath ſeldom been charged with want of prudence or dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in their actions; &amp; the Houſes have found (as to them) great juſtneſs,
and punctuality in their proceedings; by comming in according to agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and by going out according to promiſe; but now finding not onely
their Covenants and Agreements cluded, but the very grounds and true
ends for which they ſay they entred into Covenant, and joyntly took up
Armes, viz. <hi>The reformation and conformity in Religion, the defence of the
Kings Perſon, honour, and juſt greatneſſe, with the Laws, and Liberties of the
Kingdom, &amp;c.</hi> If they now find that the ways which the now prevalent par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
do purſue, are deſtructive to them all, and diametricall oppoſite to theſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:117629:7"/>
ſettlements which they have alwayes declared to intend; as if inſtead of
conformity in Religion there ſhal be brought in, &amp; tolerated a multitude of
Hereſies and Sects; If inſtead of the Kings honour, ſafety, and greatneſſe,
they that have had more then a hundred Kings, ſhall ſee Monarchy inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be levelled, and the perſon of their native King, worſe uſed then a
thief, or murtherer in a Gaole; If they ſhall ſee all Law, Liberty, &amp; proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Subject, endeavoured to be ſettled under the arbitrary tyrannicall
Power of a prevalent party, and an over-awing Army; If all theſe things
be, who can wonder if the <hi>Scots</hi> have changed their way, and concurrence,
when they find all thoſe Principles upon which they were engaged, to be
totally changed.</p>
            <p>It hath therefore been wiſdom in this Declaration, to mention the <hi>Scots</hi>
former concurrence, and to paſſe by their preſent diſſent, the cauſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they knew will not indure the ſearching.</p>
            <p>They then ſay, <hi>the King never made any offer fit for them to accept:</hi> It ſeems
the <hi>Scots</hi> are of another mind, who declare their judgements to be, that
<hi>his offers from Carisbrooke-Caſtle might have given ſatisfaction.</hi> But ſince they
will never remember any thing, but that which is for their advantage, it
will be fit to put them in mind of ſome petty ſlight offers, that by the King
have been made unto them, leaving aſide his generall Requeſt unto them.
<hi>That they would ſet down together all ſuch means as would give them ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whereunto they ſhould recive a gracious and ſatisfactory anſwer, to all that
they could juſtly or reaſonably deſire;</hi> but this being in <hi>January,</hi> 1642. time
may have worne it out of memory: But they may remember his offers
from <hi>Holdenby,</hi> from <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> and from <hi>Carisbrooke-Caſtle,</hi> In them
He offered the <hi>ſettling of Religion in the Presbyterian way</hi> (which was that
which themſelves had Voted) <hi>for three years, and then to be fully ſettled as
ſhould be agreed on by their owne aſſembly of Divines, only with the addition of
twenty to be nominated by Himſelf,</hi> to the end that before a full and finall
ſettlement all reaſons might be heard, yet no doubt might be raiſed of
carrying any thing by plurality of Votes, ſince thoſe nominated by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
were four times the number.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He hath offered,</hi> to put the whole power of the Kingdom both by ſea and land
into their hands, during the whole terme of His Reigne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And for the civill Government, he hath offred them,</hi> the nomination of all
thoſe Ministers by whom the Kingdome is to be governed.</p>
            <p>He hath offred, <hi>a generall pardon &amp; an Act of oblivion;</hi> which is an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
point, if that be true which Sir <hi>Edw. Cooke,</hi> Judge <hi>Jenkins,</hi> and all the
books of Law do tell us; or that the Army have not changed their minds,
who a few moneths ſince did declare, that <hi>no Indempnity could be ſafe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Royall aſſent, and that they would not be ſatisfied with any other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He hath offred 400000. <hi>Pounds, to be pay'd in the ſpace of one year and an
halfe, for the payment of the arrears of the Army:</hi> But all theſe trifles are not
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:117629:8"/>
worthy to be remembred, although their memory doth ſerve them better,
when they come to make up the Catalogue of theſe falſe and ſcandalous
reproaches, wherewith they revile their King, the Lords Anointed.</p>
            <p>But whereas they ſay, That the <hi>Kings offers are not fit for them to accept;</hi>
in that certainly they declare the truth, if they make their own unlimited
aimes, and ambitions, the meaſure of what is fit for them; for they will no
wayes content themſelves, with ſuch a narrow and unlimited Soveraignty
as our former Kings have had, reſtrained in our Laws, in our liberties, &amp; in
our proprieties; but they <hi>pro arbitrio</hi> wil levy what forces they pleaſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
limitation of number, or diſtinction of perſons, or quality; raiſe what
moneys they pleaſe, for the ſupport of this their military dominion; and
make what lawes they liſt, without any other aſſent but their own, and
remain everlaſtingly a <hi>repreſentative</hi> of the people, whether they will or
not; ſo that really making their aimes and intentions the meaſure of what
is fit for them to accept, no offers or conditions can be fit for them, that
ſhall not eſtabliſh them in a more abſolute power and dominion then ever
any King of <hi>England</hi> had; or any King of Chriſtendome hath; or the Grand
Seignior himſelfe doth practice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They then ſay,</hi> They cannot ſee how it ſhould be expected, that a new engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
could prevaile on Him, or engage Him more, then the ſolemn Oath at His
Coronation, with ſeverall other vowes, proteſtations, and imprecations, ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
broken by Him, during His whole Reign.</p>
            <p>Let it be calmly conſidered of, whether this be a modeſt, and decent
way of a Houſe of Commons, thus upon generals to charge their King as
a perjured man, whom they have ever profeſſed they would make <hi>a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
King;</hi> eſpecially when their ſaid charge is as falſe in the matter, as
ſhamefull in the manner; for they are not able to fix upon the King any
one particular, wherein He hath broken His Oath or Proteſtation, when
the truth of the fact, and circumſtances, ſhall be truly ſet down on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe
of the King, as well as their falſe relations of the ſaid fact, with their
inferences, ſtrains, and malitious gloſſes thereupon, and doubtleſſe if the
King were not highly punctuall, &amp; religious in the obſervance of the ſaid
Oath, He would not ſuffer thoſe miſeries &amp; hazards which He doth, rather
then infringe it.</p>
            <p>But let the breaking of Oaths &amp; Proteſtations, be with equality looked
upon; let the obligation of their naturall Allegiance, the Oathes of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
and Allegeance, without taking whereof they cannot be Members of
their Houſe; Let the ſolemn Proteſtation taken by them at the beginning
of this Parliament, in which they did <hi>promiſe, vow, and proteſt in the preſence
of God, with their life, power, &amp; eſtate, according to the duty of their Allegeance,
to maintain, and defend His Majeſties Royall Perſon, Honour &amp; Eſtate;</hi> which,
how well it hath been performed, let their own conſciences tell them.
Let their Solemne League and Covenant taken with their hands lifted
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:117629:8"/>
up to God <hi>never to depart from that bleſſed union &amp; conjunction, as they ſhall
anſwer it in the preſence of God, the Searcher of all hearts, at the dreadfull day of
judgement,</hi> how they have kept it, let their brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi> tell them; &amp;
M. <hi>Martin</hi> who ſtiles it, <hi>an Almanack of the laſt year,</hi> &amp; out of date; and the
Anſwer of the Scots Declaration, that termeth it <hi>abſurd, &amp; hypocriticall;
humane, &amp; ſo alterable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let them remember all theſe, and their often repeated Proteſtations of
making the King <hi>a glorious King,</hi> and conſider their preſent uſage of His
Perſon, &amp; their endeavours by this Declaration, of rendring Him infamous
to the world, and to all poſterity.</p>
            <p>Let them likewiſe conſider that their preſent animoſity againſt the
King, is cheifly becauſe they cannot make Him conſent to be perjured. He
hath ſworn to maintain the Laws; to protect His Subjects; to defend
the Church; to maintain the Religion eſtabliſhed by the Laws; to uphold
the juſt rights inherent in the Crown, or legally thereunto annexed; and
becauſe He will not conſent to be perjured in them all, (which He muſt
be, if He ſhould conſent to their demands) He muſt be declared <hi>unworthy
to governe;</hi> and (as hath been ſaid by ſome among them) <hi>not worthy to live;
be cloſe impriſoned,</hi> and <hi>debarred of all comforts of life.</hi> God in his due time
will be Judge between them and the King, and ſo will be all ſober and
diſintereſted men.</p>
            <p>Then they ſay, <hi>That the King in His publick Speeches and Declarations,
hath laid a fit foundation for all tiranny, by this moſt deſtructive maxime or
principle, which He ſaith He muſt avow, That</hi> HE OWETH AN ACCOUNT
OF HIS ACTIONS TO NONE BUT GOD ALONE; AND THAT
THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT JOYNT OR SEPARATR
HAVE NO POWER TO MAKE OR DECLARE ANY LAW.</p>
            <p>For the firſt part of this Maxime, the King avoweth but that which
the Law of God and the Law of <hi>England</hi> avoweth; and what all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs
and States of Chriſtendom, that have Soveraign &amp; Supream power
will avow; and would puniſh as high and capitall offenders, any that
ſhould avow the contrary. As for the ſecond clauſe, the King hath often
declared, That He doth not pretend to the making of Laws ſingly of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
but by the advice and conſent of the two Houſes: neither can the
Houſes joynt or ſeparate, nor He with the conſent of either Houſe alone,
make a Law, but there muſt be a concurrence of all three: The two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
firſt to conſent and pray, and then the King maketh it a Law, by his
declaring the Royall aſſent by <hi>Le Roy le veut.</hi> As for the declaring of
the Law, that it is the interpreting of the Law <hi>in dubiis &amp; obſcuris, vel ſi
aliqua dictio duos contineat intellectus:</hi> If the words of the Law be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and obſcure, or may bear two ſenſes; the Iudges in their Courts may
interpret and declare the meaning of the Law, and the ſame is done in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
upon Writs of Error; but that is in the high Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:117629:9"/>
before the King and the Lords, and not before the Commons, who
are no Court: But this Declaration muſt not be underſtood of plain and
cleer caſes, nor to the overthrowing of the literall ſenſe, nor of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of the Law; otherwiſe to declare and to make a Law, were all one
in effect.</p>
            <p>But not to enter upon any moot Caſe, or conteſtation of a Law point,
Let it be judged, whether upon this Maxime, it be a ſober or dutifull
expreſſion, that the King hath <hi>laid a foundation for all tiranny;</hi> but eſpecially
whether from this charge any juſt or colourable ground may be laid, for
the juſtifying of their Votes, or their preſent proceeding with the King.</p>
            <p>They then ſpeak of the Articles for the intended match with <hi>Spain,</hi>
which were treated of 25 yeers ſince by King <hi>James;</hi> And likewiſe of the
Articles of the match with <hi>France,</hi> which certainly ſhould be without
their <hi>cognizance,</hi> for the Houſes of Parliament have declared often, <hi>the
the making of peace and war, and the marriage of the Kings Children, belong
wholy to the King;</hi> And it is well known that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> inpriſoned
a Member of the Houſe of commons, for preſuming to ſpeak in that Houſe
concerning Her marriage. And the Articles of the marriage with <hi>France,</hi>
were likewiſe agreed by King <hi>James</hi> before His death; but howſoever, it
is a great audacity in the Houſe of Commons, ſingly, (after more then 20.
yeers, and many intervenient Parliaments that would never preſume to
meddle with the Kings marriage, nor the treaty thereupon) now to draw
arguments from thence, whereby to diſ-affect the people to the King; but
that they wil leave no corner unſwept, nor action unſtrained, whereby they
may render the King leſſe beloved.</p>
            <p>And as for keeping a continued correſpondency with <hi>Rome,</hi> or having
<hi>an Agent</hi> of His there (as is alleaged in this Declaration;) it is moſt falſe.
The Queen perhaps may have had and maintained ſome perſon there, for
ſuch things as ſhe held neceſſary for Her, in point of Her devotion; &amp; it is
well-known, that concerning the affairs of the Princes of Chriſtendome,
from no place ſo perfect knowledge and intelligence could be got as from
<hi>Rome;</hi> &amp; Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> (that were wiſe Princes, &amp; no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts)
were of that minde, and were at no ſmall charge to hold correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
from time to time with every eminent perſon of that Court, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the leave of the Houſe of Commons, being a body not well modell'd
for ſecrecy, conſiſting of near five hundred perſons; But the hatred to the
<hi>Pope</hi> &amp; <hi>Rome</hi> is ſuch, that it was thought the very naming of them, would
reflect with ſome hatred upon the King, which was that which was only
aimed at.</p>
            <p>Then they come to plant their maine piece of battery, or indeed
rather to worke in their Mine, whereby they would blow up the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of His Majeſty, in order to the making of Him <hi>a glorious King;</hi>
by calling to minde, and reviving the paſtages in the Parliament, the ſecond
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:117629:9"/>
year of His Reign, concerning the death of his Royall Father as they
terme it; whereas in all their impeachment againſt the Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
they did never ſo, much as accuſe him, or lay to his charge the
death of King <hi>James;</hi> but only called that which he had done, an audacious
Action; &amp; voted that he ſhould be accuſed only of <hi>a miſdemeanor of ſo high
a nature, as might juſtly be called, &amp; ſo was deemed by the ſaid Commons to be,
an Act of a tranſcendent preſumption, &amp; dangerous conſequence;</hi> &amp; for ſuch,
tranſmitted it to the Lords. But now conceiving it would be much for their
turn, to have it inſinuated &amp; let into the people, that amongſt the Articles
of their Declaration againſt the King, one was touching the death of His
Father, for ſo they ſtile it, viz. <hi>The proceeding and paſſages of Parliament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the death of His Royall Father,</hi> the paſſages whereof ſhall be truly
related in the ſubſequent Narration.</p>
            <p>King <hi>James</hi> fell ſick in the ſpring 1625. and His ſickneſſe began with an
ordinary tertian intermittant Ague, which is not held mortall, eſpecially
in the Spring; but the King having a full body, &amp; hard to be ruled or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by his Phyſitians in His ſickneſſe, His tertian turned into a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
feaver, whereof he dyed.</p>
            <p>In the time of His ſickneſſe, certain plaiſters and poſſet-drinks were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
&amp; given to Him, ſuch as are ordinarily uſed to be given by women
in the country; for that men ſeldome apply themſelves to Phyſitians in
ordinary Agues, but to ſuch received and known medicins as are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
uſed; and theſe were ſaid to be given by the Duke of <hi>Buckinghams</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement,
and prepared in his lodgings, without the direction or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Phyſitians, untill after they had been adminiſtred unto the
King: After almoſt two years (there having been in the interim a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and nothing ſtirred in the buſineſſe) the Duke of <hi>Bukingham</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
much diſtaſted the Houſes, and they being highly incenſed againſt
him, a ready ear was given to all complaints, that might afford any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
of queſtioning of him and his actions; And there were ſeverall
Articles by way of impeachment exhibited againſt him to the Houſe of
Peers; and among them, one was touching the Dukes adminiſtring of
drinks and plaiſters, without the conſent or knowledge of the Phyſitians;
&amp; many Phyſitians and others were examined, and it was with great vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
preſſed, that there might have been an accuſation of Treaſon drawn
up againſt him thereupon.</p>
            <p>But when the ſaid Article came to be Voted in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and the caſe and evidence had been truly ſtated before them by <hi>Sir
Dudley Diggs,</hi> who, with Maſter <hi>Wansford</hi> and others, had the managing
of that Article of their charge, the Houſe did hold it fit that he ſhould
not be impeached of Treaſon (the evidence indeed not bearing it) but only
of <hi>a tranſcendent preſumption,</hi> as is truly ſet down in their Declaration; but
if there had been any the leaſt ground, or evidence of any wicked inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:117629:10"/>
in the Duke to deſtroy the King, or any Symptoms that the Kings
death had been cauſed or haſtned by thoſe things that were given; or that
the ſaid drinkes and plaiſters had beene of any noxious or hurtfull quality;
it is well known, that the deteſtation againſt the Duke at that time was
ſuch, that He would not have been forborn, if the evidence would have
born an impeachment of Treaſon; &amp; many preſſed it far, alledging that
without an accuſation of Treaſon, they could neither remove the Duke
from about the Kings Perſon, nor from ſitting in the Houſes of Peers, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which it was thought they would hardly prevail againſt the Duke;
but the evidence falling ſhort, it was carryed in the Houſe for an impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
only of <hi>Miſdemeanor, &amp; a tranſcendent Preſumption,</hi> &amp; not of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
And of theſe particulars ſome now ſitting among them, (if they had
had ſo much ingenuity, or had not been reſtrained with fear) might have
informed them; And they might have been likewiſe pleaſed to remember,
that it was proved before them, that the King was embowel'd and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baumed
publiquely, &amp; no Symptomes appeared, but that He dyed natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
of His Sickneſſe.</p>
            <p>And this their Declaration (although it be ſet out with ſome ſtrains and
aggravations) conteineth little more then is here declared; concluding in
theſe words: <hi>That it is an offence and miſdemeanor of ſo high a nature, as may
be juſtly called, and is by the ſaid Commons deemed to be, an Act of tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
preſumption &amp; of dangerous conſequence.</hi> So that by their own charge
nothing is laid down againſt the Duke, but <hi>a miſdemeanor &amp; an adventurous
Act,</hi> unto which they confeſſe in this Declaration, that he put in His Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
the 8. of <hi>Iune;</hi> and the ſaid Anſwer doth yet remain upon record in
the Journall book of the Houſe of Peers: And certainly it had been much
more fair and ingenious, to have likewiſe ſet down the Anſwer, and not
to have publiſhed only the Accuſation, and concealed from the world the
Dukes Anſwer, ſince they doe acknowledge that they knew of the Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer;
but it ſhould ſeeme that made not for their purpoſe; If the Anſwer
had been weak and impertinent, doubtleſſe they would not have paſſed
by that which would have added ſtrength to their own ſuggeſtion; but
finding the Anſwer ſuch as formerly had diſcouraged them any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to ſtir in the buſineſſe, they have judged it fitter to paſſe it by; for
it muſt be known, that after the Parliament which they ſpeak of to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
&amp; in which this impeachment was exhibited againſt the Duke, there
was (before the Duke was ſlain) another Parliament, in the which the Duke
fat in the Houſe of Peers; but the Houſe having ſeen the Dukes Anſwer,
thought it not fit to revive their former accuſation, but have let it lie aſleep
almoſt this 20. yeers, untill their malice, and deſire to blaſt their King, hath
awakened it.</p>
            <p>In all their Declaration there is not one word reflecting upon the King,
but that He cauſed not (as they ſay) the Dukes preſuppoſed <hi>miſdemeanor</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:117629:10"/>
(which they, to make the ſtory ſeeme more odious, call the <hi>Kings death</hi>)
to be legally perſecuted; in which many amongſt them muſt needs conceal
their knowledge, that upon the breaking up of the Parliament, there was
by the Kings then Atturney Generall, a Bill exhibited in the Star-chamber
(which is the ſupream Court where all high crimes and miſdemeanors are
judged) and that at the inſtance of the ſaid Duke, who ſaid he would not
have that cauſe which ſo highly concerned him, to lie buried, but that he
would acquit himſelf of that foul Aſperſion, though it ſhould be with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of his life; But his imployments to the Iſle of <hi>Re,</hi> and death following
not long after, gave an end to any further proſecution.</p>
            <p>So that having in their own Declaration not charged any thing againſt
the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> more then <hi>miſdemeanor and high preſumption;</hi> nor
the leaſt reflection upon the King, but only of not cauſing the ſaid <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanor</hi>
of the Duke to have been legally proſecuted, which was hindred
by the Dukes death, and the impediments formerly ſet down; the ſole
end and ſcope of inſerting this particular in their Declaration is evident to
be, to make the King odious, as judging that nothing could more incenſe
the world againſt Him, or make His ſufferings leſſe commiſerable, then to
have it inſinuated unto the people, that among many Articles againſt Him,
one is concerning the <hi>death of His Father;</hi> which how groundleſſe ſoever,
yet they think that it may in the <hi>interim</hi> amuſe the people, and poſſeſſe
them with prejudice againſt the King, and not make them have that ſenſe
and compaſſion of Him, &amp; deteſtation of His wicked uſage, as otherwiſe
they would have.</p>
            <p>And certainly amongſt all thoſe artifices which have been uſed againſt
Him, to alienate the hearts of His people from Him, &amp; to render Him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
to the world, this is one of the moſt falſe, malitious, and ſubtle; &amp;
which can have no other drift, but by the deteſtableneſs of this aſperſion, to
allay the deteſtableneſſe of their proceeding towards Him, which certainly
no age can parrallel of Subjects towards their King.</p>
            <p>Touching the buſineſſe of <hi>Rochell,</hi> it is true that the King was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
to lend ſome of His Ships to the French King; He was newly
Married unto that Kings Siſter, and entred into a new ſtrict League and
Allyance with that Crown, being then at difference with <hi>Spain;</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
there might be many ſecret reaſons of State, for the Kings obliging
the French King at that time, which may be altogether unknown unto
the Houſes of Parliament, for that it was the doctrine of thoſe times,
that all things belonging to peace or warre, or the marriage of his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
did ſolely and ſingly belong unto the King; neither neede He
conſult with His people therein, unleſſe He craved their aſſiſtance
in Parliament by way of Subſidy, or ſupply; and it is ſtrange they ſhould
now interpoſe by way of charge, in buſineſſe paſſed more then 20. years
ſince; but that they leave no corner unſought, from whence it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:117629:11"/>
any think may be raked to make the King odious, as the aime in
this particular is to do in two kinds; firſt, by adding ſtrength unto that falſe
&amp; wicked aſperſion of the Kings unfirmneſſe in the Proteſtant Religion:
ſecondly, by nouriſhing that diſtaſt which they have with great induſtry &amp;
artifice raiſed in thoſe of the Reformed Religion in <hi>France,</hi> &amp; other places
againſt Him.</p>
            <p>It is true, that Counſell pleaſed not many; &amp; the uſe that was made of
thoſe ſhips was diſtaſtfull; which the King, and the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi>
(on whom the councell of that action, and the blame was chiefly caſt) to
ſhew that there was no intention by the loan of thoſe ſhips, to lend a hand
to the deſtruction of the Proteſtants; endeavoured to redeem that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap,
by actually entering into a war with the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> for which
one of the cheif reaſons was (although there were likewiſe other diſtaſts)
the wrong imploying of thoſe Ships (which the King had lent) contrary
to the Kings intention, and the intimation of the French, how they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to make uſe of the ſaid Ships; &amp; it is fit likewiſe to be known, that
this buſineſſe was firſt treated in King <hi>James</hi> his time.</p>
            <p>And that it was contrary to the Kings intention, may appear by his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent
actions: for He avowedly ſent a fleet, and an Army to the Iſle
of <hi>Re,</hi> under the command of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and to be adviſed
by <hi>Mr. de Soubize,</hi> how thoſe forces might be beſt imployed for the releif
of <hi>Rochell,</hi> &amp; thoſe of the Reformed Religion: And although the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Iſle of <hi>Re</hi> proved not ſucceſſefull; yet the intention and not the
ſucceſſe, is to be looked upon; &amp; the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> purſued this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of relieving <hi>Rochell,</hi> and the Proteſtants; &amp; to that end a new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and a new Fleet was prepared, &amp; he in perſon was gone to <hi>Portſmouth,</hi>
ready to ſet ſail for the ſaid enterpriſe, when by the hands of <hi>Felton</hi> he was
ſuddainly ſlain; &amp; thereby thoſe ſuccours were retarded; whereby leaſure
was given to the French ſo to fortifie &amp; block up all the acceſſes to <hi>Rochell,</hi>
that the relief thereof was rendred impoſſible; which yet notwithſtanding
was attempted by the Kings ſaid Fleet and Army, under the Conduct of
the Earl of <hi>Lindſey,</hi> though without ſucceſſe.</p>
            <p>So that certainly no good argument can be drawn from hence, either
of the Kings diſaffection to thoſe of the Reformed Religion, or to have
willingly intended their hurt; much leſs can there well be drawn from
hence any thing to juſtifie them in their preſent proceedings againſt the
<hi>King,</hi> which they themſelves ſet down to be the ſcope and intent of this
their Declaration.</p>
            <p>Let it be judged of by any ſober man, if it be not an audacious expreſſion
of Subjects towards their King, to ſay, <hi>we can fully ſhew how by Him</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell
<hi>was betrayed;</hi> beſides that it is moſt falſe, for how could the King
betray <hi>Rochell,</hi> which was not in His Power? Or can it be beleived, that
they that have forborn nothing that they could imagine might turne to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:117629:11"/>
His diſhonour, would conceal any thing that might caſt any Aſperſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Him in this of <hi>Rochell?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for that plot preſuppoſed to be many years ſince deſigned, of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in an Army of <hi>German Horſe,</hi> to have compelled the Subjects to have
ſubmitted to an arbitrary Government; they might have remembred, that
thinking thereby to have raiſed a hatred againſt the King, they have publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
this Aſperſion in ſeverall of their Papers, and Declarations; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
upon the breach of the Treaty at <hi>Oxford May</hi> 18. 164<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
His Majeſty made anſwer, as appears by His Declaration printed and
publiſhed by their own Order, in the ſecond volume of their Orders and
Ordinances, Pag. 109. wherein He ſaith, <hi>That he eſteemes his condition more
miſerable then any of his Subjects, when he ſees a few factious perſons have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
that power, as to publiſh to all his people in the name of both Houſes of
Parliament, a charge, which comming forth with a ſemblance of ſuch Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
may much worke with them againſt Him; and yet do not (which is certainly
becauſe they cannot) tell any one proof or particular, either whence, whether, or
when, or by whom, or by whoſe deſigne thoſe horſe ſhould have been brought;
they confeſſe it is many years ſince, and it ſeemes it is ſo many, that theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
are worn out of the memory of man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now what a ſtrange Impudency and malice muſt it appear to all equall
men, that being challenged, and provoked by the King, even with ſcorn
and deriſion, to inſtance in any one of the above ſpecified particulars if
they could, they doe now again revive the ſame aſpertions, without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſatisfaction, by the producing of any one proof, or giving inſtance in
any one particular; eſpecially when it is well known unto the world, that
ſuch perſons as they themſelves had whiſpered to be the men that were
imployed in the ſaid deſigne, have been highly imployed in their ſervice,
and nothing would have been kept from them, if any thing might
have been found to the Kings prejudice; but it was thought fit by them,
that this ſhould be now concealed, ſince it is apparent, that the chief end
of this Declaration, is, to accumulate all things that they conceive may
aſperſe the King, or make Him odious; for thoſe men might have told
them the miſtery of that buſineſſe; for that the Parliament having Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a war for the recovery of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and given way for the raiſing
of 10000. foot in <hi>England</hi> to ſerve Count <hi>Mansfeild</hi> in that imployment,
it was in diſcourſe how to furniſh them likewiſe with horſe; which was
thought could no where fittingly be done but in <hi>Germany;</hi> but the King
of <hi>France</hi> denying paſſage to Count <hi>Mansfeid,</hi> all that buſineſſe came to
nothing.</p>
            <p>Then they ſpeake of the <hi>torturing of our bodies by cruell whippings, cutting
off eares, racks and pillories, &amp;c.</hi> They might have added hanging, drawing,
and quartering, and hanging in chaines; for all theſe have been done in the
Kings Reigne, but executed upon Traytors, theeves, ſeditious and impious
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:117629:12"/>
libellers, by eſtabliſhed Courts of Juſtice, and according to the knowne
courſe of the Laws which were made by former Kings (his Predeceſſors)
with the conſent of Parliament; for they are not able to produce any one
Law made in the Kings reign, tending to blood or cruelty: how many
have been made for the eaſe and enlargement of the Liberty of the people,
they have often themſelves confeſſed them to be more then by any of his
Predeceſſors: And ſhall the doing of Juſtice according to the Laws, by his
Judges and Miniſters of Juſtice, be charged upon him as acts of cruelty? ſhal
the burning of theeves in the hand, or rogues in the forehead or ſhoulder,
or what Mr. <hi>Gregory</hi> doth at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> in the due execution of legall ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
be ſtiled cruelty? for ſuch have been all theſe <hi>whippings, rackes, &amp; pillories,</hi>
which they ſpeake of; And they are challenged to inſtance in one drop of
blood drawn by his Majeſty, or any one Act of cruelty committed by Him
in his whole raign, or by his Judges or Miniſters whom He hath not left to
the Juſtice of the Law.</p>
            <p>For it will not be denied, that from the 3. of November 1640. untill
the 12. of Jan. 1641. when he was driven from <hi>London,</hi> all His Judges
were wholly left unto them; many of them being impeached of Treaſon;
and Judge <hi>Berkley,</hi> whom they thought the moſt criminall, arraigned
for Treaſon, who made a defence ſo honeſt, and ſo able, that they were
forced to wave their legall Triall of him, and to pick his purſe by
their arbitrary power. Was there ever ſo ſtrained a malice, eſpecially if
they looke how themſelves have proceeded? not to ſpeake of thoſe
multitudes that have been ſlaine in the War, how many of the Kings
honeſt loyall Subjects have they murthered in cold blood, by no Law
but their owne arbitrary power? with how many new Treaſons have
they enſnared the ſubject, by the ſingle authority of ſome haſty and
angry Ordinances, notwithſtanding that the Law telleth us, what
ſhall be Treaſon and nothing elſe, but by Act of Parliament? what cruelty
hath been uſed in point of impriſonments, where many have dyed
for want, or ill uſage? and how many perſons of quality, both Divines
and others, hath been by them ſent a ſhip-board, and kept under deck?
and ſeeing a perſon of quality, and a Judge of great years and reverence,
out of heat and indignation, ſent to <hi>Newgate,</hi> a priſon for Rogues, Thee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves,
and Cutpurſes? how many Gentlemen and Peers did they Vote to
death, and loſſe of their whole eſtates, and to be excepted from pardon
and mercy, without ſummons, hearing, tryall, or conviction? how many
Noblemen, Gentlemen, Judges, and divers of great age, have they
forced out of <hi>England</hi> to begge their bread in ſtrange Countries, not
allowing them one penny out of great eſtates (which they have ſeized)
to keep them from contemptible poverty, notwithſtanding that the
Law alloweth to the higheſt Traytors, a conveniency for food and
raiment for themſelves and family? And yet theſe men have had the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:117629:12"/>
face to fix upon their King theſe odious markes of cruelty, when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deny, but in his reigne there hath been leſſe blood by attainder, and
fewer confiſcations, then in any ſuch ſpace of time ſince the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>the lording over mens ſouls.</hi> The Laws for the government of the
Church (not eſtabliſhed by this King, but by his Father and Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>)
were put in execution with ſo much mildneſſe and moderation,
that they can ſcarcely inſtance in the puniſhment of any Separatiſts or
Sectary, if his Recuſancy (for the Law maketh them Recuſants as well as
Papiſts) hath not been accompanied with ſome crime, or ſome ſcandalous
or ſeditious preaching, or writing againſt the preſent government; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they may remember, and ſee in the new book of entries, 5. <hi>Paſchae,</hi>
35. <hi>Eliz. fol.</hi> 252. that <hi>Pendry</hi> for publiſhing two ſcandalous books againſt
the Church Government, was indicted, arraigned, attainted, and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at <hi>Tyburn:</hi> And let their preſent <hi>lording over mens ſouls</hi> be conſidered;
their ſending ſo many learned and pious men a begging, by depriving them
of their livings; impriſoning their perſons; <hi>their lording over their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi>
by new, illegall, and trayterous Oaths; by forcing of <hi>the Covenant,
to the ruine of many hundreds, who otherwiſe were without exception, both
Miniſters and Lay-men; being conſciencious men; men of parts, and great
learning,</hi> as is ſet downe in the preceding words of the Anſwer to the
<hi>Scotch</hi> Declaration of the 4. of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1648. But nothing can by them be
done amiſſe: that Axiome of the Law <hi>le Roy ne fait tort,</hi> is now with the
Crown and Soveraignty, (which they have uſurped) applicable onely
to them. But all the Kings actions, though never ſo legall, juſt, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
muſt by them have the appellations of <hi>tyranny, cruelty, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They then ſay that <hi>they were worſe then ſlaves, for they were prohibited by
Proclamation to ſpeake or hope for another Parliament.</hi> They ſhould have
done well to have ſpecified the year and date of the ſaid Proclamation,
and to have ſet down the very words contained therin; for it is ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
a thing, that the people ſhould be forbidden by Proclamation, to
<hi>hops,</hi> that no rationall man can chooſe but ſuſpect it to be that which
civility is loath to tearme it, how foule ſoever their pen be againſt their
King.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>ſearching of cabinents, cloſets, &amp;c.</hi> It is ſet down to be after
the diſſolution of the Parliament; ſo that that ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt
(never to be forgiven) of breaking the Priviledges of Parliament, is not
charged, and any other ſinne will not be found; for it is lawfull and
uſuall for the Juſtice or Councell of the King, to <hi>ſearch the cloſets, and
cabinets</hi> of ſuch as they have good cauſe to ſuſpect of practiſes, and
correſpondency, to the prejudice of the King or Kingdome; neither
have the Kings or Queens letters or cabinets, nor the diſpatches of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:117629:13"/>
and forraign States, been free from their inquiſition and ſearch;
nay ſome ſuch ſearches have been made by them for Letters and Jewels
upon women not of the meaneſt ranke, as is indecent to put them in mind
of.</p>
            <p>They then reckon up a long liſt of <hi>Monopolies, and Patents of Soap, Pins,
Leather, Sugar, &amp;c.</hi> Whether the ſaid Patents were legall, or illegall,
there can from thence no juſt fault be laid upon the King; He is in point
of Law to be adviſed by His Atturney, and His learned Councell; And
there cannot in all the particulars ſpecified, any one be inſtanced in,
which He did of Himſelfe, without the Certificate of the Referrees,
of the legallity of ſuch Grants, wherein never Prince was ſo pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
as He hath been, and it is conceived that it may be with truth aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that in His whole Reign He hath not paſſed by Patent any one Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly,
without reference, and certificate in writing, that it might be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Law.</p>
            <p>But beſides, upon complaint this Parliament, all grievances have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed;
all doubtfull Patents cancell'd; care had for the preventing of
the like for the future; all referrees and patentees left to juſtice; and all
puniſhed, but ſuch as the injuſtice of the Houſes have protected.</p>
            <p>Then they come to that which they call <hi>the compendium of all oppreſſion
and cruelty, viz. The Ship-money:</hi> When Princes are involved in great wants
and neceſſities, they are forced to thoſe things which at other times they
willingly forbear to preſſe; So it was here; The King by His Wars with
<hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> was brought into great neceſſitys; and conſulting how
He might by lawfull wayes releive Himſelfe. He was adviſed to this courſe
of <hi>Ship-money</hi> by His Atturney Generall <hi>Noy,</hi> (as is ſaid) who was by all
men eſteemed a great Lawyer, and had been a great propugner of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
liberty: The King herein asked the opinion of His Judges, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Councell; And both the Judges (the major part of them) &amp; His Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
did ſet it under their hands to be lawfull; theſe are the Kings proper
councel with whom he is to conſult in point of Law, &amp; are ſworn to adviſe
Him faithfully; But ſome, and particularly Mr. <hi>John Hamden,</hi> not ſatisfied
with the extrajudiciall opinion of the Judges, came to a legall tryall upon
the Caſe in the <hi>Exchequer Chamber;</hi> &amp; after a fair hearing and learned ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
on both ſides, Judgement paſſed for the King. If the ſaid Judges
and learned Councel (who are ſworn to do equall juſtice betwixt the King
and the Subjects, &amp; to Councell the King faithfully) have erred and done
amiſſe in both, the greater hath been their fault and offence; But
herein where lieth the Kings tranſgreſſion? For did he not leave the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
upon complaint of the Houſes, to their Juſtice? and were not the ſaid
Judges many of them impeached of high Treaſon? &amp; Judge <hi>Berkley</hi> arraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
thereupon for high Treaſon? and made ſo learned and able a defence,
that they were forced to withdraw any further proſecution of their
<pb facs="tcp:117629:13"/>
impeachment againſt him. It ſeems they forget that which they declared
for Law at the beginning of this Parliament, (viz. that <hi>the King can do no
wrong, Le Roy ne fait tort</hi>) upon the very ground of this Caſe; And that
the reaſon why the Law ſuppoſed that the King could doe no wrong,
was, for that the Judges and Miniſters that did the wrong, were reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable
for the wrong doing; and the perſons wronged, were from
them to be repaired in point of their dammages: But it ſeemeth they are
of old <hi>Ployden's</hi> minde, that when the buſineſſe concerneth themſelves,
the Caſe is altered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They then ſay,</hi> The King ſummoned this preſent Parliament, in hope to
have Aſſistance against the Scots.</p>
            <p>He had little reaſon to hope for any aſſiſtance againſt the Scots, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as he did, who had called them in; and that from ſome Scots them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from <hi>Newcastle,</hi> whilſt he was at <hi>Yorke,</hi> He had gotten notice of
the particulars, wherewith divers Lords of the Engliſh with the King
being ſtartled, they ſent to the Scotiſh Lords at <hi>Newcastle;</hi> to have right
done them upon a Secretary of theirs, who had ſaid to ſome Engliſh
priſoners whom the Scots had taken at <hi>Newborn,</hi> That their comming in
had not beene, but by the invitation of the Engliſh; and had ſpoken a
little too boldly of ſome truths that ſhould have beene concealed,
and this divers at <hi>Westminster</hi> cannot but remember.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They then ſay, that</hi> it was impoſſible to quaſh thoſe pernitious Councels
without questioning the Authors; Whereupon the King ſhewed Himſelfe ſo
paſſionately affected to ſuch malignant Councellers &amp; their Councel, that he
would ſooner deſert or forcc his Parliament, and Kingdom, then alter His
courſe, or deliver up his wicked Councellors to Law and Justice.</p>
            <p>Our paſſions (eſpecially that of revenge and malice) do not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
us of our ſenſes and reaſon, but often bereave us of ſhame and
honeſty: For beſides that they know that the King hath more then
thrice in his publique printed Anſwers declared, That He would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
no man of what quality or nearneſſe ſoever unto Him, from any
legall Tryall according to the Law; He did leave unto their Juſtice
the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> all the Judges, and
whomſoever they would accuſe; inſomuch that they examined and
committed the Queenes Confeſſor; and examined the Ladies of Her
bed-chamber. And their Sergeant at Armes preſumed ſo far, as to come
into the Kings withdrawing-roome next unto His Bed-chamber,
to cite and ſummon Perſous of greateſt quality and nearneſſe unto
Himſelfe; inſomuch that out of ſhame the King hath bin forced to
withdraw Himſelfe into his bed-chamber, notwithſtanding that the
Law ſaith, that <hi>a Lord cannot in the Kings, preſence ſeize his ſlave or villian
that hath rnn from him.</hi> And from the third of <hi>November</hi> 1640 untill
the 10. of <hi>January</hi> 1641. when the King was driven out of <hi>London,</hi> then
<pb facs="tcp:117629:14"/>
was no man, Counſeller, Judge, or Perſon of what quality ſoever,
exempt from their Juſtice.</p>
            <p>And to ſhew how willing He was to ſatisfy them; that Hee would
not interrupt or hinder the courſe of Juſtice, He gave way to that which
ſome Princes would rather have adventured a War then have conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
unto; which was his giving leave to His privy Counſell (that
had bin ſworn to keep ſecret whatſoever paſſed in Councell) to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
upon Oath of what had paſſed in his own Preſence &amp; moſt ſecret
cabinet Counſell, againſt one of their own fellows in a capitall Cauſe;
which is likely hereafter to cauſe him to be ſerved with caution; when
men ſhall not know how ſoon they may be queſtioned for that which
they do adviſe, which is in effect againſt themſelves; for if one ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cuſed
of Treaſon, the reſt likewiſe may be queſtioned for Concealment.</p>
            <p>They ſpeak of <hi>ſome that fled fearing to be queſtioned;</hi> certainly they had
great reaſon ſo to do, when their proceeding was ſuch, as not to be guilty
but only to be accuſed, was certain ruine, or impriſonment for many
yeers, divers having languiſhed two or three years in Priſon; &amp; the Arch
biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was almoſt fonr yeers in priſon before he was put
to death And ſuch as obſerved the proceedings with the earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>
would not willingly (how innocent ſoever) fall into their hands, if it
were to be avoyded; for they may remember how by the procurement
of ſome amongſt them, tumults &amp; multitudes ſurrounded the Houſe of
Peers, crying <hi>Justice, justice, and they would have the Traytors head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They may remember their poſting up of 59. Members of the honſe of
Commons, that would not give their Votes to the Bill of Attainder of
the Earl: If they have forgotten it, their own Hiſtoriographer Mr. <hi>May</hi>
may put them in minde of it; They may likewiſe remember that at the
ſame time upon an empty Tun rolled from a Tavern doore, a liſt of the
Lords names whom they called <hi>Malignants,</hi> was read in the midſt of
that rabble in the Palace yard; and although the Houſe of Peeres then
repreſented theſe violences to the Houſe of Commons, they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
obtein their aſſiſtance to ſuppreſſe them, or to declare againſt them;
and they may remember whether it was not ſaid amongſt them, <hi>that
they ſhould doe ill to diſcountenance their freinds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other ſide, let it be remembred how many Counſellers who
have bin Actors in all the pretended Exorbitancies of the Star-chamber,
Councel-table, &amp; high Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſiion, being once become perſons in whom
they might confide, were left unqueſtioned; Let them remember that
when they expelled all ſuch Monopolers as they judged affectionate to
the King, whether they left not ſome others of their favorites ſitting
amongſt them untill this day? But for that it would be too long to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
in many things of this kinde, as having imployed the moſt infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Projectors and Catchpoles in their ſervice: they ſhall only be put
<pb facs="tcp:117629:14"/>
in minde of one particular of an eminent Member of their Houſe, who
would have preſented a Petition ag<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inſt a great Counſellour, who was
much favored by Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> and others, who having gotten notice of the
Contents thereof, would never permit it to be read in the Houſe; but
the ſaid party having worn out three Copies in his pocket, engroſſed
it in parchment; but ever when he ſtood up to ſpeake, Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> or ſome
other appointed to watch him, interrupted him with ſpeaking to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the Houſe (which are alwayes to have the precedency;) &amp; this for
many months together, inſomuch as the ſaid petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could never be read.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>the Kings deſerting of His Parliament,</hi> it hath bin ſo often an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
that it is a shame to repeat it; only this ſhall be added, that
the King did not deſert his Parliament, but was forced in great haſte
to fly for the ſafety of his Perſon, which would the next day have bin
in great hazard of being ſeized. And although this preſent houſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
be not charg'd w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> any ſuch intention (ſuch reſolutions paſſing few
hands, and that there are very few left there now that were truſted with
that ſecret) yet it hath bin confeſſed, and is under the hand of a perſon
that hath bin very active in their ſervice, and who ſhould have bin a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
Actor in it.</p>
            <p>Then followeth that thread-bare buſineſſe of <hi>bringing up of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Army,</hi> ſo often objected, and ſo often ſcorn'd by thoſe that knew
the miſtery of it; which if the King had endeavour'd to have won to His
ſervice, and full adherence, He had done like a wiſe and prudent Prince;
neither had there bin any cauſe for the concealing, or not avowing of
any ſuch endeavour, if it had bin ſo; For it is well known by whom
that army was endeavour'd to be ſeduc'd from the kings ſervice &amp; from
the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> who was their Generall; nor was the Earl ignorant
therof, neither would he have fai'ld in his proofs, having it in his thoughts
ſpeedily to have impeached ſeverall perſons of high Treaſon, for tampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
with the ſaid Army; as is well known not to a few ſitting ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them at <hi>Weſtminster;</hi> but they by their diligence got it by the
hand, by impeaching him a day or two before his impeachment againſt
them was ready, which coſt him his life.</p>
            <p>Beſides, they know the perſon that ſtarted this hare among them hath
often clear'd the king, that it was impoſſible that the K. ſhould know of
the propoſition of <hi>the bringing up the Army,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was his own motion, &amp;
was by ſome rejected as a thing too high, &amp; not liked by others, for that
he would have the cheif command of the Action, which would not be
condeſcended unto; whereupon out of diſcontent, he went immediately
and made his diſcovery to the lower houſe, without ever ſeeing the king;
but there had been ſome ſpeech before of a petition to be procur'd from
the Army (which was publiſhed) &amp; what knowledge the King might
have of preferring ſuch a petition, is not known to the writer of this
<pb facs="tcp:117629:15"/>
anſwer: but the party that firſt gave the houſes notice of this buſines hath
often ſworn, that all he ſaid concerning the King in this buſineſſe, was in
relation to the ſaid petition; but that the King could never have nor had
notice of the propoſition of <hi>bringing up the Northern Amy;</hi> for that being
his own motion, he preſently (ſeeing it diſapproved, eſpecially his having
the cheif Command and Conduct of the Action) revealed it, before the
King could poſſibly have knowledge of it, which party is yet living, and
certainly will avow as much.</p>
            <p>But preſuppoſing the King ſhould have gotten knowledge of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(which doth in nothing appear, (the King ſeeing the great tumults,
&amp; the great hazard that his own perſon was in, as well as the freedom of
Parliament; might He not have reaſon by His own Army, raiſed by Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and payed by His own moneys. (as it had bin for many moneths)
endeavored to have ſecured His own ſafety, and the freedom of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitting any ſuch crime, as meriteth to be depoſed, or u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
as now He is?</p>
            <p>Let it be compared with that which the now prevalent Party in the
houſes have don, who ſeeing themſelves like to be over-awed by the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
party, &amp; finding no other means not to be overborne, thought it
fit to have recourſe unto the preſent Army of Independents &amp; although
the then houſe of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons had voted a petition of the ſaid Army to be
burnt, &amp; ſuch to be enemies of the State, as ſhould adhere thereunto; yet
the army was drawn up towards <hi>London,</hi> &amp; the houſe forced to ſequeſter
eleven of their moſt eminent members; &amp; when the City or Apprentices
had reſtored the ſaid 11 Members, (as they had in former times don the
five Members) the Speaker, &amp; all ſuch as had deſerted the parliament, &amp;
had fled to the army, were by force again reeſtabliſhed; &amp; the new Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
M. <hi>Pelham</hi> was unchaired, and all that party were driven away, ſome
forced to fly, others were impeached; &amp; the now prevalent party poſſeſſed
themſelves again of the houſes, &amp; the power they now have of depoſing
the King, &amp; keeping of Him Priſoner. There is a great dfference betwixt
what they have really don by this army, for the turning upſide down the
Parliament; and what was ever ſpoken of, of the Northern Army. But
Succeſſe and Power will make the ſame things (though acted) commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
in thoſe that prevail, which they will have capitall in thoſe who
never paſſed further then diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They then begin to ſpeak of</hi> the tyrany towards Scotl. &amp; Ireland &amp;c.
<hi>For that of</hi> Scotland (<hi>which is formerly anſwered) I ſhall only ad the ful
ſatisfaction which the Kingdome of</hi> Scotland <hi>received by their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment,
expreſſed by a petition made ſince the Kings laſt coming
from</hi> Scotl. viz.: That Whereas The Kings moſt ſacred Majesty's royall
zeal, &amp; conſtant reſolution of maintaining the true Religion &amp; preſerving
the laws &amp; liberties of theſe kingdoms is ſo undoubted, that to call it in que-
<pb facs="tcp:117629:15"/>
&amp;c. could not be construed in any, but an unchristian distrustfulnes &amp; in us
his Ma. Subjests of this His aucient &amp; native kingdom the height of diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
&amp; ingratitude, if we ſhould harbor any ſcruple or thought to the contrary
having ſo many real &amp; recent evidences of his Royall goodnes, justice &amp; Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dom,
in ſetling &amp; establiſhing the trne Religion &amp; the Laws &amp; Liberties of
this His kingdom, to the full ſatisfaction of all his good ſubjects. And never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles
prerceiving by his Ma'. Declarations &amp; other printed papers, that
foul &amp; malicious aſperſions are cast on his Ma. tending to be and his ſacred
perſon, &amp; deprave his royal Govern', &amp;c. we conceive our ſelves bound in du<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty
to almighty God (by whom we have ſworn to defeud &amp; maintain the perſon
greatnes, &amp; authority of our dread Soveraign, Gods vicegerent, to the utmost
with our means &amp; lives, in every cauſe which may concern his honor, as may
apear by that which by the warrant of the Act of the generall Aſſembly, we
have all ſworn &amp; ſigned) &amp; to our king &amp; country, and to that we ow to our
honor &amp; reputation, to repreſent to your L<hi rend="sup">ps</hi>. the deſires we have to expreſſe,
&amp; make known to his Ma. &amp; all the world, that we are fully ſatisfied, and
perſwaded of his Majeſties royal zeal &amp; reſolution, &amp; that malice &amp; detra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ction
cannot prevail to make the leaſt impreſſion in our loyal hearts, of jealou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſie,
or distrust: And therfore we have taken the boldnes humbly to petition
your L<hi rend="sup">ps</hi>. That as his Majeſty hath graciouſly condeſcended (in his letter to
your L<hi rend="sup">ps</hi>. printed by your warrant) for ſatisfaction of his good ſubjects, to ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>preſſe
his Royal goodnes, &amp; deſire, that all grounds of jealouſy may be kept
and removed out of the hearts of his good Subjects of this Kingdom: So it
may pleaſe your Lordſhips to think vpon ſome courſe, that his Majeſty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally
may be cleered, and aſſured of our constant affection, &amp;c. and
that we are not ſo unthankefull to God, or to his Vice-gerent, nor ſo little ten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der
of our own honor and credit, as to forget ſo ſoone that duty, incumbent to
us by ſo many obligations, and ſo often promiſed by us in our foreſaid ſolemn
Oathes, which are publiſhed to the view of the whole World, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>As for the Rebellion in <hi>Ireland</hi> they make uſe of this to the ſame end
they do of all things elſe in their Declaration. That knowing that horrid
rebellion to be ſo deteſtable to all men (as it juſtly deſerveth) they would
fain draw part of the hatred of it on the king, although it be with never
ſo improbable or falſe pretext<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And they think in the meane time that it
will ſerve the preſent turn, of making the king odious, till He may have
means to cleer it by His anſwer (which they never intend to afford Him,
untill they have eſtabliſhed their tyranny) and then they will not care to
be fought againſt with papers. But their Declaration in this point of <hi>Ing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
[beſides that the points conteined in it have been ſo often anſwered
in print] doth ſo confound all times, all actions, either in the War, or
whileſt there was a Ceſſation; and all the circumſtances and reaſons,
which may juſtify ſuch actions at one time, as might be blameable at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
that the anſwere muſt be applyed to the generall Scope of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
which is, to inſinuate unto the world, that the King did abet
<pb facs="tcp:117629:16"/>
and favour the Rebellion; which not only the Kings many Declarations,
but his reall and effectuall actions do evince of falſehood, and deteſtable
malice; For He did wholy put the Iriſh buſineſſe, and the proſecution of
the buſineſſe, into the hands &amp; management of the two Houſes; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to an act of parliament, giving them power to raiſe men &amp; mony,
and all other neceſſary proviſion for that war, notwithſtanding that they
had ſubtilly inſerted into the preamble of the ſaid Act, a clauſe debat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Him and His ſucceſſors from the power of levying men by way of
preſſe, without conſent of Parliament; although it had beene alwayes
uſed by His Predeceſſors. But ſuch was their art by the inſerting of the
ſaid Clauſe, that they would either gain the diſclaiming of that power
to preſſe men or elſe would render the King odious, by publiſhing his
refuſall to doe that, which by the Houſes was thought neceſſary for the
ſuppreſſing of that horrid Rebellion: This artifice hath been ſince uſed
by clogging moſt Bills (which would be plauſible to the people) with
ſome clauſe or parentheſis of great prejudice unto the King which He
hath been often forced to paſſe by, to avoid the diſtaſte which the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
of thoſe plauſible Bils would have brought upon Him; &amp; ſo He
did in this.</p>
            <p>Beſides this his concurrence in all that was deſired of him; being
at <hi>Yorke,</hi> &amp; having ſome beginning of power he offered to have paſſed
in perſon into <hi>Ireland,</hi> for the ſubduing of thoſe Rebells; and to let the
world ſee, that He deſired rathet ro imploy thoſe forces againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> then by them to raiſe the leaſt jealouſie of raiſing a war in
<hi>England;</hi> But this His Majeſtyes offer was by the Houſes rejected; and
the King did then ſee that the forces and the moneys that were levyed
by his conſent, and Commiſſion, were in part imployed againſt Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
to ſtrengthen &amp; pay the forces that were deſigned to march againſt
Him; whereby the War of <hi>Ireland,</hi> (which had beene moſt proſperous
under the wiſe and faithfull Conduct of the Marq. of <hi>Ormond,</hi> for which
the Houſes ſent him publique thanks, &amp; a preſent) began to be very du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious
by their neglect, &amp; their applying of the moneys &amp; forces preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for <hi>Ireland,</hi> againſt the King; &amp; ſo by degrees the Engliſh Armies in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> were reduced to thoſe great ſtreights for want of pay &amp; provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
by the ill Conduct of the Houſes; that after many ſollicitations both
to the King and Parliament, by which little or no releife was obteined;
there was a neceſſity of coming to a ceſſation of Armes for one yeare;
which was done by the adviſe of the Councell of <hi>Ireland;</hi> &amp; at the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
petition of the Lords, &amp; of the cheif Officers of the Army, (of whom
the Lord <hi>Inchiquin</hi> was one) as appeares by their own booke of Exact
Collect. <hi>page. 344. To.</hi> 2. where likewiſe the neceſſity of the ſaid ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
is at large ſet downe: And the King ſeeing Himſelfe much over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd,
&amp; like to be overborne by the Rebels in <hi>England,</hi> was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb facs="tcp:117629:16"/>
to make uſe of the forces offered Him from <hi>Ireland,</hi> who were there
ready to ſterve; which certainly would have beene a great imprudence in
Him not to have done; and is as great an impudence in them to charge
this as a fault or crime upon the King, to aſſiſt Himſelfe of His own
Subjects for His defence: when they (at ſo great an expence to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom)
have hired in a forraign Nation (the Scots) to ſubdue Him.</p>
            <p>Next they alleag concerning the proclamations, <hi>That though they decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that the Rebels in Ireland stiled themſelves, the King &amp; Queens Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
yet they could not obtain a proclamation against them in divers moneths;
&amp; then alſo but 40 Copies might be printed &amp;c.</hi> The firſt perfect adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement
of the Rebellion of <hi>Ireland,</hi> came to his Majeſty &amp; Counſell in
England from the Lords Juſtices (Sir <hi>William Parſons,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace</hi>)
and Councell of <hi>Ireland;</hi> wherewith they ſent the draught of ſuch a
Proclamation as they conceived beſt for the ſuppreſſing thereof; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
thoſe Rebells did pretend that what they had done was for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the King, and not without ſome authority from him, it was by the
ſaid Lord Juſtices Letters deſired, that 20 copies of thoſe Proclamations
might be ſent over, ſigned by the Kings own hand, (whereas the uſuall
courſe was to ſend over only one ſo ſigned) that (beſides thoſe which
they were there to print, and publiſh after the uſuall manner) they might
ſend ſome of the Originals ſo ſigned, to ſome of the chiefe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells
to manifeſt the falſhood of the ſaid traiterous pretence.</p>
            <p>And though Proclamations which the King Signes either for <hi>England</hi>
or <hi>Ireland</hi> never uſe to be printed, yet it was now for better expedition
held fit by his Majeſty, &amp; the Lords of his Councell, (whereof divers of
thoſe now ſitting in the houſe of peers at <hi>Westminst.</hi> were then preſent)
that thoſe 20 proclamations his Majeſty was to ſigne, ſhould be printed;
and the Secretary being directed to cauſe it to be forthwith diſpatched,
did accordingly preſently ſend a warrant to the Kings Printer, to print
about 40 Copies, and to ſend them to him for his Majeſties ſervice; and
to deliver out none to any other, for that thoſe were to be Originals for
the Kings ſignature only, &amp; to be by them reprinted in <hi>Ireland,</hi> according
to the uſuall courſe. And to have any copies of them diſperſed in <hi>England</hi>
before they were proclaimed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> (where they were principally of
uſe) as it was never practiſed, ſo it was conceived it might have bin of
ſome prejudice; for that the ſaid Iriſh Rebels (who had forged the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
falſe pretence) might (if they had gotten any Copy thereof before
they had bin proclaimed in <hi>Ireland</hi>) have divulged ſome other traiterous
fiction, to have rendred the Proclamation of leſſe credit with their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
&amp; ſo have fruſtrated the good which His Majeſty and his councell of
both Kingdoms did hope that proclamation would have effected. And
whereas it is alleaged as a fault, that there were but 40 of thoſe Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
ſent into <hi>Ireland;</hi> it is well known to the Lords of the Councell
<pb facs="tcp:117629:17"/>
now ſitting at <hi>Westminster,</hi> that it was twice as many as was deſired.</p>
            <p>And whereas they ſay, that <hi>the Iriſh Rebels called themſelves the King
and Queens Army;</hi> It is the conſtant practice of all Rebels at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to countenance their Rebellion with the pretence of the Kings ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
and that they take Armes againſt the oppreſſions of evill Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
and Miniſters that ſeduce the King: The like was done by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
at the beginning; who only pretended to remove <hi>Malignants</hi> and
<hi>evill Councellors</hi> and to bring <hi>Delinquents</hi> to puniſhment; and then their
war was in the name of <hi>King and Parliament,</hi> as ſome of their own have
not of late forbore to put them in mind. But now it is to remove the
King from the government, and to ſettle another of their own making,
<hi>without the King or against Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the disbanding the Iriſh Army, although the King had great
reaſon to demur upon it; yet ſuch was his deſire to gratify them, that
He condeſcended unto it; &amp; themſelves conſented that they ſhould take
any forreign imploiment whatſoever; but afterward would not give way
to the tranſporting of them; &amp; by that meanes much ſtrength was added
to the Iriſh Rebellion; all which they themſelves cannot deny. And upon
ſuch malicious falſe inferences as theſe, depend all or moſt of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced
Accuſations in this their Declaration.</p>
            <p>They ſay, <hi>the king refuſed to give Commiſſions (though often asked by the
Houſes) to the Lord Brooke, &amp; the Lord Wharton.</hi> The king knew well how
little reaſon he had to truſt either of them. The Lord <hi>Brooke</hi> was often ſo
indiſcreet, as to profeſſe openly and often, that <hi>he was wholy Antimonar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall,</hi>
and once in the hearing of ſeaven or eight,) for which he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by ſome of his diſcreeter friends yet ſitting among them) &amp; it may
be eaſily reduced to their memories; beſides his other faults, which ſhall
not be remembred, becauſe he hath given an account of them. For the
Lord <hi>Wharton;</hi> the King was not then ignorant of his ſeditious and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous
wayes againſt him, after ſo many obligations of the Kings put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him &amp; his friends, which he hath ill repaid by his actions; &amp; hath ſince
had a more profitable and gainfull Trade at <hi>Westminster,</hi> then he could
have had in any martiall imployment, to which it ſhould ſeem his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
diſpoſition doth not much incline him.</p>
            <p>They then ſay, that <hi>they need not tell the world how the Scots entred this
Kingdom with a powerfull Army.</hi> It were indeed much to their honor &amp;
loyalty to have it concealed; for it was by their invitations and negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and upon ſo hard termes and conditions, that the Anſwer to the
Scotiſh declarati<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſet out the 4 of <hi>Ja.</hi> 1647 ſaith, that <hi>their Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſioners
would by no means have brought them, but that they could get no better.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They then ſpake of <hi>the L. Digby's attempting the Country with unuſuall
arguments of armed troops:</hi> It was conceived that they had long ſince bin
aſhamed of that ridiculous tale of the L. <hi>Digby's</hi> raiſing war againſt the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:117629:17"/>
King (for ſo their impeachment runneth) with a Coach and ſix Horſes.
Next they ſay, <hi>he adviſed the King to retire Himſelfe to ſome ſafe place.</hi> If he
had done ſo, it had been good and honeſt Councell; but it was not any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to the King, but his opinion only written in a private lettter to his
brother <hi>Sir Lewis Dives</hi> what he judged ſafeſt for the King, being forced
to fly out of <hi>London</hi> for feare of M. <hi>Skippon's</hi> great march, which was to
be the next day to convoy the accuſed Members to <hi>Westminster.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now followes the Negotiations with <hi>Denmarke,</hi> and the ſtory of a <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of the Lord Digby's hiring of a Skipper to be pilot to a fleet preparing in Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke;</hi>
which fleet proved to bee the Cow-fleet that uſeth to bring cattell
out of thoſe parts into <hi>Holland,</hi> And for the Lord <hi>Digby's</hi> man, as hee never
had any name, ſo the truth is that hee had no man with him at that time, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of <hi>England</hi> only with a Dutch Gentleman in his company; neither
is their own word of Truth in the whole ſtory. And for <hi>the Kings ſolliciting
for Ammunition and Succours from his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle of Denmarke,</hi> it were to have bin
wiſhed that His ſolicitations had bin as ſucceſſefull as they are juſtifiable.</p>
            <p>And touching <hi>the letter ſaid to be written unto the King of Denmarke;</hi> it is
very likely indeede, that the King would have invented ſuch a ſcandall <hi>to
His own ſhame, and the reproach of His Mother</hi> if he had not had ſome grounds
for it; And yet it is true that they may ſay in the name of the Houſe, that it
<hi>never entred into their thoughts;</hi> Buſineſſes of that nature are ſecretly laid, and
carryed on by a few: But there are ſome at <hi>Westminster</hi> that know what
paſſed in that buſineſſe, and by whoſe loyalty the motion of it was quaſhed
in the bud: And when his Majeſty may be heard, or His Accuſations may be
admitted of, Hee will be eaſily drawne to give them and the world ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in this point; it were to be wiſhed that they would give as good ſatisfaction
for their malice in inſerting this particular in their Declaration, in ſo unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly
and undecent termes towards their King, ſtiling it a <hi>falſe and ſcandalous
charge, and ſuch an Act as they beleive was never a more unworthy one done
by any Prince, to the ſhame of His own Mother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They then adde another breach of Truſt, That <hi>the King had ſent away
with the Queene the anciene Jewels of the Crowne,</hi> Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>may I not
diſpoſe of my own as I pleaſe?</hi> The jewels were His own, bought with His own
money, or with the moneys of His Anceſtors, and not with the moneys of
the Crowne; neither doe they produce any entaile of them upon the Crown;
And certainly in the preſent condition whereunto they had reduced Him,
Hee could never have juſter cauſe to ſell or pawn them, then that which they
themſelves ſet downe, for Armes and Ammunition for His own defence and
preſervation.</p>
            <p>The King, <hi>they ſay,</hi> once ſent a ſpecious Meſſage of renewing a Treaty, but his
meſſenger was instructed to manage a bloody maſſacre in London, which was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned
by vertue of a Commiſſion of the Kings ſince publiſhed.</p>
            <p>Hereof they give us no more proof but that they ſay it; and for the bloody
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:117629:18"/>
maſſacre intended, it is a moſt falſe and malicious ſlander; there being
no other Deſigne but to protect His owne Loyall Subjects in <hi>London;</hi> and
to reduce His Rebels; which certainly was more juſtifiable for Him
to doe, eyther as their King, or as an Enemy in open Warre, then their
barbarous murthering of <hi>Tomkins,</hi> and the reſt, only for endeavouring of
their duties.</p>
            <p>And for the Commiſſion they ſpeake of, it was ſuch a one as not only in
time of war Hee might thinke fit to doe, but might legally have done it in time
of Peace.</p>
            <p>Touching the <hi>Kings march to Brainford,</hi> the Reaſons thereof have been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
declared in print, to the ſatisfaction of all indifferent Readers.</p>
            <p>But thoſe barbarous cruelties they ſpeake of to bee committed by the King,
are moſt falſe; for there was not one man ſlaine but in the heate of War, and
the King gave to all his Priſoners their lives and liberties, only upon engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
not to take Armes againſt Him for the future; which engagement they
traitrouſly and falſly broke, being thereof abſolved by ſome of their wicked
Miniſters, as ſome of the ſaid Priſoners (being afterwards taken againe) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed.</p>
            <p>The reaſon why the King changed His minde from ſtaying at <hi>Windſor,</hi>
and advanced to <hi>Brainford,</hi> was for that whileſt their Commiſſioners were
ſent to him to <hi>Colebrooke,</hi> that very night information was brought, that
they were advanced with their Army and Ordinance towards Him, and
they take it very ill that Hee would not ſtay at <hi>Windſor</hi> till they came to
take Him.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>denying to receive their Petitions,</hi> they give no inſtance of it in any,
neither will it bee proved I beleeve, that ever it was done, unleſſe the Petition
were to be delivered with an Army at the heeles of it, or by ſuch a perſon as
the King, by name, had declared <hi>Traitor,</hi> and excepted from Pardon.</p>
            <p>They then begin to ſpeake of the Queen, upon whom (if they could) they
would willingly caſt ſome aſperſion, as well as upon the King. But becauſe
there are many particulars ſcatteredly ſet downe in this Declaration concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
her Majeſty, they ſhall in this Anſwer be ſet down here together, that
the cleerer Judgement may be made of them.</p>
            <p>They ſay firſt, That <hi>by that time the queenes pious Deſigne to advance Popery
was ready for the Byrth.</hi> That Deſigne was moſt induſtriouſly examined by
them, and they had before them in the Houſe of Commons Sir <hi>Kenelme
Digby, Mr. Montague,</hi> and divers others; and upon the narroweſt ſifting of
that Buſineſſe, they thought it then fit to proceede no farther in it; But now
they make uſe of it to caſt Aſperſions upon the king and queene, when they
could finde no cauſe to puniſh the chiefe Actors in the ſaid Buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, they ſay, That</hi> there was a great Deſigne amongst the Papists for
a generall maſſacre in Ireland and England, and that a great Royall Perſon had
a hand in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:117629:18"/>
It is to be wondered at, that they ſhould on a ſuddain become ſo modeſt,
as not in plain words to name (the Queen, whom they had formerly
impeached by name (with all Her titles) of high Treaſon, and ſought
Her life; And now they would ſlily inſinuate into the people, that ſhe
had a hand in ſo execrable a Deſigne, as to maſſacre all the Proteſtants of
two Kingdoms; And that upon information given unto the late Lord of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> without a telling by whom the ſaid information was given,
or when; neither ſet they down by whom the ſaid maſſacre ſhould have
bin acted, or by what Plot; It is to be thought that it ſhould have bin
performed by the ſame hands that ſo many of the Peers, and of the Houſe
of Commons ſhould have bin ſlain, had it not bin prevented by the Tai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors
diſcovery in <hi>Moorefeilds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, they ſay <hi>That the king confeſſeth He had ſent the Queen to Holland.</hi>
It ſeemeth that ſhe was an obedient Wife, and He a carefull Husband of
Her, when He ſaw that moſt barbarous and inhumane uſage of Her, that
Her very Bed-chamber could not be priviledged, but her Nurſe, and her
Confeſſor muſt be examined againſt Her.</p>
            <p>They adde, That <hi>with the Queen He ſent the</hi> Jewels <hi>of the Crown.</hi> In whoſe
hands could He better truſt His own goods, which He ſaw likely to be
taken from him, as his Houſes, Furniture, and whole Revenue, and that
of the Queen and Prince had bin by them? Neither could He expect that
His Jewels ſhould have bin ſafer then his liveries for His Guards have bin
of late; And certainly his Jewels were better diſpoſed of, if they were
pawned for Powder and Ammunition, then His Guard's Coats that are
ordered to be ſold outright for fire and candles for Souldiers at
<hi>Whitehall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then they ſay, <hi>the Queen many moneths before Her voyage to Holland, was
going beyond the Seas, had not their Motion to the King ſtayed Her,</hi> It ſeemeth
then that the King was willing to gratify them, although it were with
the croſſing of the queen's deſires; and that the King's ſending of Her
afterward into <hi>Holland,</hi> was not untill ſhe could not remain any longer
amongſt them with Safety or Honour; For they themſelves doe beleive
that the King could have bin very well pleaſed to have enjoyed Her
Company.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the particulars that they ſet downe concerning the queene, in
which there is little remarkable but their deteſtable malice; for were it to
bee expected that the queene; bred up a Roman Catholick, and by Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
and the Kings Oath, to enjoy the uſe of her Religion in ſuch ſort
as was agreed, ſhould not looke to enjoy it? Eſpecially her carriage ever
ſince her coming into <hi>England</hi> having beene with that Prudence and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
that the great Officers of her Court, and moſt of the Ladies
of her Bed-chamber, have beene Proteſtants, enjoying daily the uſe of
their Religion in Her Court, without beeing preſſed by her to the leaſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:117629:19"/>
Act, in waiting upon Her or otherwiſe, that might offend or ſtrain their
Conſciences. But that a Princeſſe of ſo high Extraction as the blood of
<hi>France,</hi> &amp; Daughter of the great <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and their Kings Wife,
that never had done any perſon wrong, but obliged all whenſoever it
was in Her way, ſhould finde ſuch uſage from Subjects; as to have all
malicious falſe Libels countenanced againſt Her; to be queſtioned for Her
life, only for the aſſiſting of Her Hnsband; to be forced to fly the Kingdom;
to have all Her Revenue taken from Her; and now as though ſhe had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
a generall maſſacre, to be rendred odious by this malicious Libell,
authorized by the name of the Houſe of Commons, it cannot but be held
a moſt inhumane and barbarous proceeding, as indeed it is, by all the
World but themſelves.</p>
            <p>Touching <hi>the Letters written to the Pope,</hi> King <hi>James</hi> ſent His Sonne (then
Prince) into <hi>Spain,</hi> being about 20. years of age; and inſtructed Him, and the
Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> that waited upon Him, in all things touching the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation
of the Prince's marriage, which was then in Treaty for a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Spain.</hi> And of all that paſſed, the Prince gave the King His Father
almoſt daily advertiſment by expreſſes; and He received from Him like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
directions upon all emergent occaſion, neither ſent He any Letter to
the <hi>Pope,</hi> without His Fathers privity and allowance. King <hi>James</hi> likewiſe
Himſelfe at the ſame time did write Letters to the <hi>Pope,</hi> which He publique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
avowed, ſaying, The Pope was a Temporall Prince, and He would
write unto Him upon any occaſion in ſecular Affairs, as freely as He did to
the great Magor, or to the great Turke, when He wrote againſt him in
point of controverſies in Religion, He would then (He ſaid give him thoſe
Appellations that the Cauſe required, but in His letters miſſive, He would
give Him thoſe Reſpects and Civilities that befitted one temporall Prince
towards another. And certainly King <hi>James</hi> was no Papiſt, although He
were no freind to Sectaries and Separatiſts but had written more in the
defence of the Reformed Religion, and to the diſpleaſing of the <hi>Pope,</hi> then
all the Princes of Chriſtendom had done ſince the Reformation, and when
He dyed, ſcarcely left a wiſer man behinde Him. But they are brought to
great ſtreights, when they are driven to take in the Fathers grave (dead 25.
years paſt) to finde matters for their malice againſt the Sonne.</p>
            <p>For the Letters ſpoken of to be <hi>written to the Pope, on the behalfe of the
Duke of Lorraign,</hi> I muſt confeſſe I want Information in the point of the
fact, But if it were ſo, He could not have written for a Prince that was nearer
allyed to Him. And whereas it is ſaid, that <hi>in requitall an Army to invade En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland
muſt be raiſed by Him,</hi> It is a very unlikely Story, that the Duke of
<hi>Lorraign</hi> ſhould be in condition to raiſe an Army to invade <hi>England,</hi> But if
He could afford His Kinſman Auxiliaries, or any other ſupplyes, He ſhould
he much to blame if He did it not.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Kings offer to the Scots of the plunder of London, if they would advance, or
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:117629:19"/>
of 300000. pounds, and foure Northern Counties only to stand neuters:</hi> Beſides the
ridiculouſneſſe to conceive any ſuch offers could be made, they doe not ſo
much as offer at any kinde of proof but follow their rule held throughout
in all this their Declaration; <hi>audacter accuſare, aliquid haeret, accuſe boldly, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
will stick.</hi> They have all the Kings Letters and Cabinets; and it is not
likely that any ſo great tranſaction could only have been verball: But if the
King ſhould have made this impoſſible offer, or any other, ſhould He not
have done like a prudent and good Prince, to have called His own Subjects
from the adherence to His Rebels, to their own Loyalty and Duties, though
it ſhould have bin by out-bidding of them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>After the Kings returne from Scotland, the great quantity of fire workes found
in Papists houſes:</hi> No naming where, nor when, nor by whom the Papiſts
ſhould have ſubdued the kingdom, only with granadoes and fire-works with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any foote or horſe, but thoſe that about that time they had diſcovered to
be kept under ground; O how contemptible is it for a Houſe of Commons to
abuſe the kingdom with ſuch ſquibs?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then they ſay,</hi> Morters with great peeces of Battery were mounted againſt the
City; and ſuch Officers placed in the Tower, as were not only ſuſpected by them,
but by the whole City, who durſt not abide in their houſes, as by their ſeverall Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions
is manifest.</p>
            <p>They doe not ſay that one gun was ever ſhot, and they know that no
one man did for feare forſake his houſe: nor any one Act of injury or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtility
committed towards them. As for the Lieutenant of the Tower, they
would confide in none but ſuch as a few factious men of the Houſe (who had
conſpired with a great party in the Citty) did appoint; The King to give
them ſatisfaction removed Sir <hi>Tho. Lunsford;</hi> then put in a Gentleman of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
honeſty and worth, and of great fortune (<hi>Sir John Byron</hi>) againſt
whom no exception could be taken, but that he was not of their party; againſt
him (when no other pretence could be found) they alleaged, that if a Perſon
were not put into the Tower, in whom the Merchants might confide, there
would be no more money brought into the Mint: And although a hundred
thouſand pounds caution were offered on the behalfe of <hi>Sir John Byron,</hi>
yet nothing would ſatisfie, unleſſe the Tower were put into ſuch hands as
they pleaſed to nominate, and it was publiquely avowed that if it were not
ſpeedily done, they would ſeize it by force; and to that purpoſe they cauſed
multitudes every day to come to the Houſe whileſt that buſineſſe was in agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>And as for the Petitions, they know that they were all of their owne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king;
and whoſoever Petitioned without their Order, or not ſuteable to their
ſenſe, were ſeverely puniſhed; as in the Petition of <hi>Kent,</hi> and many others,
only ſuch as they had ordered to be delivered to the Houſes; and when they
had no reaſon to uphold their demands, they then made uſe of tumults, and
ſeditious and threatning Petitions in ſtead of other Arguments; theſe they
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:117629:20"/>
ever countenanced and ſupported; as they did in this caſe of the Tower, when
they cauſed Petitions to be delivered, deſiring to know the names of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
Lords that obſtructed the buſineſſe of the Kingdome, and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to aſſent to the Votes of the Commons, and they would right them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by the remedy next at hand (by which they meant their ſwords and
clubs in their hands) and thereby forced the Votes of the Lords, as it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
was done by the Apprentices at <hi>Pelham's</hi> Parliament; inſomuch that
that which had bin voted by 42. Lords, for the not removing of <hi>Sir Iohn
Byron</hi> from his Lievetenancy of the Tower, was now carryed by 16. or 17.
votes only; (contrary ro the orders of the houſe, that ſuch things as upon the
queſtion had beene once ſetled, might not again that Seſſions be put to the
queſtion) And by the threats of their Petitions; the noiſe and tumults at the
doores by the multitudes; the intimation of danger from the Houſe of
Commons, and from the enraged People, which they feared would not
be in their power to prevent: and by the Lords of the Party, who moſt
boldly (contrary to the eſſentiall freedom of Parliament, relying upon their
friends at the doore) voted all ſuch as ſhould continue to diſſent from the
Houſe of Commons, to be Enemies of the State; whereupon moſt of the
Biſhops and Lords (fearing to be reformed by the remedies next at hand)
held it wiſdome to withdraw themſelves: only 14. of above fourty (that had
formerly voted the contrary) withdrew themſelves; and ſo the Lords of the
Party over-ruled it; And this narration will appeare to be true by the
Booke of the Houſe of Peers, if they have not ſince thought fit to expunge
it. So that it is thought very ſtrange, that the wiſdome of the Houſe of
Commons (by calling to minde the uſe that they have made of Petitions)
ſhould give cauſe to have the memory of ſuch ſhamefull proceedings to be
revived.</p>
            <p>They then ſay <hi>that from this time the track of open force began to appeare.</hi> They
firſt inſtance the Kings charging ſome of both Houſes of Treaſon; the Kings
deſiring to have ſome tryed by due courſe of Juſtice (never before denyed to
any King, and in their owne remembrance practiſed, and by the Houſe of
Peeres allowed) muſt now be accounted a Crime, and an Act of open force
in the King: but forget how many of their Members the Army hath impeached
and forced to fly.</p>
            <p>They then ſpeake of <hi>the bloody Tragedy intended by the Kings comming to the
Houſe of Commons, if the affections of the City had not prevented it.</hi> If there had
been <hi>any bloody tragedy intended by the Kings coming to the Houſe.</hi> it would
have been the ſame day put in execution, before the City could have prevented
it. But they may remember if they pleaſe, the teſtimony of Cap. <hi>Aſhley,</hi> taken be
fore a Committee of both Houſes at <hi>Grocers-Hall,</hi> if it bee not ſuppreſſed;
wherein hee declared, That the King at the upper end of <hi>Weſtminster-Hall,</hi>
before he went up the ſtayres to the Houſe of Commons, charged all thoſe
that accompanied Him (except ſome few ordinary Servants) <hi>not ſo much as
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:117629:20"/>
to come to the staires, nor to offer violence or injury to any Perſon upon pain of
their lives.</hi> Further, the King in that point did let himſelfe downe ſo low to
give them ſatisfaction, as was never done by any King towards His Subjects;
but nothing but the diſ-throning of Himſelfe, and leaving the Soveraignty,
<hi>is fit for them to accept.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They ſay, that <hi>the King entred a Protestation into the Councell booke, that His
calling of them a Parliament, did not make them ſo;</hi> And therein He ſaid very
true, that His calling of them a Parliament doth not make them a Parliament,
(that can be only done by His Writ) no more then His calling them no
Parliament, doth make them to be no Parliament. But it is true, before His
reſtraining of himſelfe, hee could when hee pleaſed have diſſolved them;
But if they have committed Treaſon or Felony; and that that which their
Oracle Sir <hi>Edw. Cooke,</hi> Mr. Solicitor, and that reverend old <hi>Eleazar</hi> Judge
<hi>Jenkins</hi> doe ſay, be true, That Treaſon and Felony do ſuperſede all priviledges
of Parliament; And although a Corporation cannot commit Treaſon, yet
every perſon of the Corporation may; and if one, then ten, if ten, then a
hundred, and ſo all: And if that Houſe have had the ill lucke to commit Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
or Felony, (although the King by reaſon of His reſtraint ſhould not
diſſolve it) yet it may become <hi>Felo de ſe,</hi> and may deſtroy it ſelfe: And it is
much doubted whether the King can raiſe them from the dead.</p>
            <p>Then they come to their <hi>standing amazed at the Kings ſolemn Protestation of
having never any thought of bringing up the Northern Army; or levying of forces
to wage war againſt his Parliament; or to invade the rights of his Subjects; or
bringing in of forreign forces.</hi> They ſhould have done well to have ſet downe
the date of the ſaid Declaration; as likewiſe the particulars wherein He hath
ſatisfyed His ſaid Proteſtations; and not to have kept themſelves ſtill upon the
fraud of generalls; nor confounded the times before they had entred into
Armes, with the times after the King had proclaimed them <hi>Traitors</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells;</hi>
times and circumſtances, do often juſtly alter Councells, and make thoſe
Actions neceſſary and good, which without them might have appearance of
blame: But if the particulars ſhall be ſet down with the times and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
the falſhood, as well as the malice will appeare, of their ſo often reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
reproaching their King, with breach of Oaths and proteſtations.</p>
            <p>They doe farther then charge the King, that <hi>He endeavoured to get out Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
Powder, and Shot out of his own stores; and they have a letter to that effect
to Sir Iohn Heyden:</hi> They ſay likewiſe that <hi>Hee did attempt to have forced
Hull in an hustile manner.</hi> Two ſuch faults in the King as doe marvailouſly
juſtify their reſolutions and uſages of him, which they ſet down to be the
Scope of this Declaration: In the one, the King would have imbezel'd His
own proper goods; and in the other, He would have come into his own Town,
had not the Traitor <hi>Hotham</hi> kept him out for which they have given him ſuch
a reward, as others may juſtly expect, if their repentance and the Kings good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
doe not prevent it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:117629:21"/>
It was not long (<hi>they ſay</hi>) before the King proclaimed them Traitors and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,
and ſet up his Standard against the Parliament, which never King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
did before Himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Herein they are miſtaken, for the King did not ſet up his Standard againſt
His Parliament; His Parliament was never named at the ſetting up of His
Standard; but it was ſet up againſt thoſe whom Hee had firſt proclaimed
<hi>Traitors</hi> and <hi>Rebels,</hi> which hath bin often done by the Kings of <hi>England;</hi> And
ſo did His Majeſty now againſt an Army marching toward Him, to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
His Perſon; and that within few dayes after gave Him a battell, and did
their beſt to have ſlain Him under the command of the Earle of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> with
whom they had all ſworne and proteſted <hi>to live and dye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that which they ſay, that <hi>never any King before ſet up His Standard
againſt his Parliament;</hi> it is true, for no King ever needed a Standard againſt
His Parliament; for that at their pleaſures they could diſſolve it with
a breath; and ſo might his Majeſty have done now, had not His goodneſſe
and unprovident deſire of gratifying them reſtrained Him, by aſſenting unto
that Act for the continuance of this preſent Parliament: which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
proteſted in one of their Declarations, <hi>they would never make uſe of to
the Kings diſſervice, but only to the ends for which it was granted, viz.</hi> to be a
ſecurity for the rayſing and paying of moneys; which how they have perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
let the world judge.</p>
            <p>it is then ſaid, <hi>the King called a mock-Parliament at Oxford;</hi> It is true that
the King having declared the Members ſitting at <hi>Westminſter</hi> to be <hi>Traitors</hi>
and <hi>Rebels;</hi> and Treaſon, as themſelves have often acknowledged, diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
all Priviledges, Qualifications, Capacitie, or abilities to act as a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
the King was enforced to call to His Councell and Aſſiſtance, His
loyall Members of both Houſes, that had bin wrongfully, or by force and
tumults driven from the Houſes at <hi>Westminster;</hi> and to require of them in His
ſo great diſtreſſe their helpe and advice: but it is conceived that they
will not be able to ſhew, that the King ever ſtiled it his <hi>Parliament,</hi> but <hi>an
Aſſembly of the Members of the Lords and Commons convened at Oxford.</hi> And
for that which they inſtance of private letter, intended only for the ſight of
the Queene His Wife, they will faile of the end for which they produce it,
which is, to withdraw the affections of His faithfull Servants (which they
call <hi>His own Party</hi>) from Him by telling them, that <hi>they may perceive what
reward they may expect, when they have done their utmost, and ſhip wrack't
their faith and conſciences to His will and tyranny:</hi> But his party (as they terme
it) which are His faithfull and loyall Subjects, as they have already moſt
of them loſt their Eſtates and Fortunes for their Conſcience and Loyalty to
Him; ſo they will ſacrifice their lives willingly for His ſervice and reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And as for that by-name of <hi>a mock-Parliament,</hi> which they give unto
that Aſſembly; They may remember that there was double the number of
Peers more then remained at <hi>Westminster;</hi> and for the Members of the Houſe
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:117629:21"/>
of Commons, they much exceeded in their Eſtates and Fortunes all thoſe
that were left behind them. They may likewiſe remember that they have
not wanted their by-names in print; as <hi>the Jugles,</hi> &amp; <hi>Hocas-pocuſes at Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter;</hi>
and by ſome who have ever adhered to them, have been ſtiled a
<hi>Linſey-wolſoy-Parliament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and their own Army in their Declaration, have
called them a <hi>Parliament ſwayed by a factious prevolent party, that governed
by an arbitrary tyrannicall Power.</hi> Theſe things I muſt confeſſe are ſet down
by me (that have been a Member of the Houſe of Commons) with great
grief, remembring the reſpect and reverence which in former times was
born unto that Houſe, and now changed into ſo great Scorn and Deriſion
as weekly comes forth in print.</p>
            <p>They then adde, <hi>His often breach of truſt with the Proteſtants of</hi> France,
Scotland, Ireland, <hi>and</hi> England, <hi>with all other His unjuſt oppreſſions; and His
often endevours to enſlave them by German, Spaniſh, Lorraign, Iriſh, and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,
and other forrein forces.</hi> Thoſe other forces muſt certainly be of <hi>Turks,
Swedes,</hi> or <hi>Polands;</hi> for they have particularly recited almoſt all other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
when now in all this their Declaration, (except ſuch from <hi>Ireland</hi>
who were His own Subjects, and who were bound in duty to come to the
ſuccour of their King, being invaded by a forreign Nation, called in by
them to conquer Him) they have not been able to inſtance in ſo much as
one Company of Foot, or Troup of Horſe of forreigners, that He hath
called in, but they hope by this great noiſe of reciting ſo many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to fill the ears of the People, and to abuſe them; as they did by the
ſpeaking of the death of His Father; of the reproaching of His Mother:
of His bloudy Cruelties, His oppreſſions, and Tyranny; His breach of
Truſt, of Oaths, and Proteſtations; and with thoſe odious names, and a
bold Accuſation, (to which He ſhould not have means to anſwer) to make
ſomething ſtick with the people, whereby to alienate their Hearts from
Him; and to allay the deteſtableneſſe of their moſt inhumane and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
proceeding with Him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They then ſay,</hi> neither do we wonder He ſhould forget His Vows and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations,
that He would never conſent to a toleration of the Popiſh Religion, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolition
of the Laws then in force againſt Recuſants, yet about the ſame time He
wrote Letters to the Queen, and the E. of <hi>Ormond,</hi> that He would conſent to the
taking away of all penall Laws againſt Papists both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching the Letters to the Queen, and the Marqueſſe of <hi>Ormond,</hi> they
are all printed by their Order; and according to the information I have
credibly received, by thoſe Letters it will appear, that the penall Lawes
touching Recuſants were not to be taken away; and the favours intended
to the Papiſts were with ſuch limitation, as they think fit to conceal.</p>
            <p>Beſides, there is a wide difference betwixt a toleration of Popery, and
the not putting in execution the penall Lawes; and ſo there is betwixt the
aboliſhing of the penall Lawes, and a temporary forbearance of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:117629:22"/>
of them, which hath been practiſed by Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> and
His Majeſty; but never in ſo high a degree, as by themſelves toward the
Sectaries and Separatiſts (who by the Law are Recuſants as well as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts;)
yet they have made uſe of them in their ſervice, without diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of any Sect, Schiſme, or Hereſie; inſomuch that at <hi>Plymouth</hi> they
made uſe of ſome Turks in their ſervice out of the Gaole, that had been
condemned as Pyrats. And let them remember of what a compoſition
their new model'd Army is, by whom they have carried through their
Rebellion; and how carefull they are now to uphold the liberty and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of them, under the name of <hi>tender Conſciences.</hi> Yet it muſt be a Crime
in the King, for the ſaving of His Crown, to encourage His own Subjects
to be loyall unto Him; and to aſſiſt Him againſt his Rebels, by promiſing
them ſome favour againſt the rigour and extremity of the Lawes. There
is no Religion, or Nation, Engliſh, Welch, Iriſh, Scottiſh, French, Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,
Dutch, Germans, Turks, whoſe ſervice they have not uſed to
depoſe their Soveraign, as it is now apparent, although at firſt they all
fought for the King and Parliament: And if He ſhould have made uſe of
them for His juſt defence, or ſhall do for His juſt reſtitution, His doing ſo,
would be much more juſtifiable before God and man then what they have
done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They then ſay, that</hi> notwithſtanding that both Houſes, and the Scotch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
did declare, that they did hold a perſonall Treaty was not ſafe, yet the
Houſes now yeelded to that; <hi>that is, to a perſonall Treaty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They might have remembred that the Scots in their Papers do ſet down
why at that time they held a perſonall Treaty at <hi>London</hi> not ſafe; <hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the King had ſeveral Armies on foot, &amp; many ſtrong garriſons then;
neither was it known what party, or correſpondency He might have in
<hi>London;</hi> all which conſiderations were now ceaſed; and that therefore at
preſent they held a perſonal Treaty (and that to be with the Houſes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>) moſt neceſſary. And thus with their Art in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
of Times, they labour to abuſe the World; and to make ſhew as
if they had yeilded to all that which the Scots now deſired; whereas they
would not treat with the King but in the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> and not with the
Houſes, as the Scots Commiſſioners deſired, but with their Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
And whereas the Scots deſired that <hi>the King might be free and at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi>
they would have Him ſtill their Priſoner.</p>
            <p>They further ſay, <hi>that all this was yeilded unto, upon condition that the King
would ſign but four Bils, which they judged not only just and honourable, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
even for the preſent Peace and Safety during ſuch a Treaty.</hi> Hereby
they would inſinuate that they deſired the four Bils but for ſecurity during
the Treaty; whereas they know that thoſe Bils were to be made Acts of
Parliament, and ſo perpetuall Laws; unleſſe they intended that the Treaty
ſhould be everlaſting.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:117629:22"/>
As for the <hi>juſtneſs, honourableneſs,</hi> and <hi>neceſſity of the ſaid four Bils;</hi> If they
have vouchſafed to read the <hi>Kings</hi> Anſwer (which was not of ſuch impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
whether they did or no, their reſolution being taken before; that if
the <hi>King</hi> would not undo Himſelfe, they muſt undo Him, which is ſaid to
have been the ſpeech of a Member of that Houſe) if they had read the <hi>Kings</hi>
Anſwers, they would have found that the <hi>King</hi> had convincingly made it
appear, that this their way of proceeding (beſides the unreaſonableneſſe of
the Bils themſelves) was irrationall, impoſſible, and muſt be ineffectuall to
the making of Peace, for which this Treaty was pretended to be; To which
might be added, that it would have been invalid.</p>
            <p>It was irrationall; for that it is contrary to the nature of a Treaty, that
the chief Subject matters of the Treaty ſhould be firſt aſſumed.</p>
            <p>It was impoſſible; becauſe the <hi>King</hi> was deſired to paſſe theſe Acts by
Commiſſion under the great Seale, and not by His preſence in Parliament,
whereas there is no ſuch thing as a great Seale, but a mock-Seale of their
owne making, of which Sir <hi>Edw. Cooke,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sollicitor,</hi> and the above-named
reverent Judge, as well as three Statutes, have likewiſe delivered their
opinion.</p>
            <p>It muſt of neceſſity be ineffectuall; for no Peace could be concluded
without the Conſent of the <hi>Scots;</hi> and they in the name of that Kingdome
proteſted againſt their Bils, and manner of proceeding; and like rationall
men they declared, that they could not but wonder, that it could be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
that the <hi>King</hi> having ſo often refuſed the ſaid Bils, for the procuring
of a Peace, ſhould now condeſcend unto them, only for the procuring of
a Treaty.</p>
            <p>Invalid it muſt needs be; for it is well known, that impriſon'd Princes
(eſpecially by their own Subjects) can do no valid Act to the prejudice of
themſelves, much leſſe of their Succeſſors; beſides it is well known what
the doctrine of the above ſpecified Authors and the Law is, touching
conſtraining of the <hi>King</hi> by force. There ſhall no more be ſaid of the
manner of their condeſcending to ſuch a condition'd Treaty (which they
inſinuate to have been <hi>a gracious proceeding</hi>) only I will ſet down what a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
man ſaid of it, &amp; then ſpeak to the matter of the Bils by them deſired:
That the <hi>King</hi> was uſed like a man that had had his horſe, moneys, ſword,
cloak, and cloak-bagge violently taken from him; and the men that had
rob'd him (ſo that he would promiſe not afterward to proſecute them)
were content to treat with him about reſtoring him ſome part of his
goods; but he ſhould firſt give his conſent that they might keep his horſe,
his money, his ſword, and his cloak; but for his cloak-bagge, his nightcap,
his ſlippers, and his ſhirts, they would treat with him; And becauſe he
would not yeild to thoſe conditions, they ſtript him of his cloaths, bound
him, and caſt him into a ditch.</p>
            <p>For the matter of the Bils they ſay nothing, not ſo much as to inſinuate
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:117629:23"/>
what they were, and of them there will be a Tract apart; only two or
three words ſhall be ſaid to let the world ſee, that there were never ſo
ſhamefull propoſals made by any Subjects to their King; eſpecially upon
His refuſall to yeild unto them, to lay the ground for His depoſing, and
impriſoning.</p>
            <p>1. If the King ſhould have condeſcended to the ſetling of the <hi>Militia</hi>
according to the Bill offered by them, He ſhould have deveſted himſelf and
the Crown for ever, of the means of protecting his Subjects, the Law, or
the Church, and thereby have been abſolutely perjured, by breaking His
Oath of Coronation; he ſhould have left his Subjects meer Slaves to their
abſolute power, by giving way that they might levy what men they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
without diſtinction of Perſons, Quality, or limitation of Numbers; and
under the pretext of paying the men ſo levyed, might raiſe what moneys
they pleaſed, without reſtraint either in the manner or proportion. And
having already (as they pretend) the Legiſtative power in their hands
without the King; it is much wonderd that they ſhould preſſe for any more
Bils then this; for hereby alone they ſhould be the moſt abſolute Princes
in Chriſtendom, their Wils being the only Laws, and a ſetled Power to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
their Will.</p>
            <p>2. But it ſhould ſeem being hereby become Princes, they would not
want that noble Power of Soveraignty, of conferring of Honours; They
had once this Parliament nominated a liſt of Perſons whom they intended
to have made Dukes, Earls, and Barons; and now they would hook in that
Power by a Bill. It may be ſaid they intend it not without the King: That
is but an illuſion, for if they ſhal by Bil make ſuch Perſons Peers, as they wil
pretend have by their fidelity and courage preſerved the State; they have
already declared, that the King ought to give His Conſent to ſuch Bils as
the two Houſes offer unto him; and in this rewarding of ſuch <hi>Heroes,</hi> as
have been the preſervers of their Country, they will not take a Denyall.
And for their ſupplying their new Lords with Eſtates and Revenues for
their new callings, that is but giving the Eſtates of ſome of the loyall Lords
(whom they call <hi>Delinquents</hi>) to thoſe their new Lords; which is done in a
morning by an Ordinance, as firmly as if it were by Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>3. In their third Bil, of having all Declarations &amp; Proclamations of their
Treaſon and Rebellion to be revoked, they do not pretend a generall Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
or Act of Oblivion; but they wil have a Juſtification of all their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and proceedings; and all the blame and bloud of the War to reſt upon
the Kings head, and his Adherents; and that they as Traytors and Rebels
have forfeited their Lives and Eſtates, wherewith they will enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
So that the King muſt not only pardon, but juſtifie them whom He
hath ſo often declared to have been Traytors, and in his conſcience belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
them to be ſo (although he be willing to forgive and forget all that
is by paſt) but muſt leave in the hands of their mercileſſe Enemies, thoſe that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:117629:23"/>
His conſcience telleth Him have been and are innocent loyall Subjects; and
can be charged with no Crime, but that they have ſerved Him faithfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Obligations by the Law of God, the Law of the Land,
their Oathes, and naturall Allegeance. Inſomuch that they are not content
that the King ſhould be poor, and without any Power or Authority; but
as they labour in this Declaration to render Him odious to His people, ſo
they would make Him infamous to all Poſterity, by delivering His faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
true ſervants and Friends (that have ſuffered ſo much for Him) to to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
ruine and deſtruction.</p>
            <p>4. Their fourth Bill, <hi>is,</hi> for the further Declaration of the Act for the
continuance of this Parliament, as is pretended; but in effect it is a further
ſettling and confirming of it; And certainly if there did any ſhame remain,
they would bluſh to move the King in any thing concerning this Bill; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
upon what grounds the King was induced, or rather conſtrained to
grant it; &amp; how they have ſolemnly proteſted by their Declaration of the
19. of <hi>May 1642. That they would do nothing by vertue of that gracious Act,
which otherwiſe had not been fit to have been done.</hi> But what uſe have been
made, and ſtill is, of the ſaid Act, (beyond the Intention in the preamble of
the ſaid Bill expreſſed) to the diſſervice of the King, and deſtruction of the
Kingdome, let the world judge.</p>
            <p>Now ſince the Kings not condeſcending to theſe four Bils, is that which
they themſelves ſet down in this Declaration to be the formall and reall
Cauſe of their making theſe Votes, and conſequently of depoſing and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoning
the King, (For all the other particulars are but Aggravations and
Accumulations of faults, which they ſay they have hitherto borne) but this
the Kings preſent denyall of their Bils, is that which without Scorn and
Contempt to themſelves, and ruine to the Kingdome, they may not ſuffer;
and therefore have taken their preſent reſolutions, to have no more to do
with the King, but to ſettle the Kingdomes without Him.</p>
            <p>The caſe lyeth then plainly before the indifferent Reader, whether the
refuſing of four ſuch Bils, ſo deſtructive in the matter to Monarchy; ſo
enthrawling of the People to all ſorts of Slavery; and in the manner ſo
compulſory, ſo irrationall, and ſo impoſſible, be a juſtifiable Cauſe for
Subjects to depoſe their King, to impriſon His Perſon, to defame Him to
the World, and to deny Him all means of Vindicating His Innocency and
Honour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But now they ſay,</hi> having made this laſt ſo juſt and honourable application,
they cannot but conclude, that by not aſſenting unto it, He hath forgotten not only
His duty to the Kingdome, but alſo the care and reſpect which He owes to, Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and His own Family.</p>
            <p>How juſt and honourable the ſaid Application hath been, hath been
formerly ſhewed, of which it may be with truth averred, that leaving aſide
the wickedneſſe in the matter, no ſtory ancient or modern can parallel it
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:117629:24"/>
(for the undutifulneſſe and impudence of it) in Subjects towards their
King.</p>
            <p>To conclude, they ſay, <hi>that for theſe few of many reaſons, they cannot repoſe
any more trust in Him; but have made thoſe former reſolutions.</hi> Certainly they
have done ill to paſſe by their many reaſons; for theſe few have been much
too weak to ſupport ſo great a weight, as the wickedneſs of their depoſing
their King, and the uſing of Him as they do: and it is to be beleived, that
they would make uſe of the beſt of thoſe reaſons, having ſo great ſtore out
of which to make their choice.</p>
            <p>In the next place they ſay, <hi>They will notwithſtanding indeavour to ſettle the
preſent Government, as may beſt ſtand with the Peace of the Kingdome.</hi> It is
likely indeed to be a righteous Government, and to laſt long, that a preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
party in the Houſe of Commons ſhall ſettle without the King, and
againſt all Law.</p>
            <p>WHAT hath been hitherto ſaid, hath been to ſhew how free the <hi>King</hi> is
from the Aſperſions endeavoured to be caſt upon him by this Declaration;
together with the great malice and falſhood of it. Firſt, many things in
matter of fact are moſt untrue; as that the <hi>King</hi> ſhould have a hand in the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion; That there was a Deſigne of a generall Maſſacre of all the
Proteſtants in <hi>England;</hi> That the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> fleet that came into the <hi>Downes</hi>
1629. was to enſlave the Subjects, &amp;c. with many more ſuch ridiculous
falſhoods.</p>
            <p>Other things are perverted by falſe application of the facts, as that the
Horſe that were ſpoken to be raiſed in <hi>Germany,</hi> were for the enſlaving of
<hi>England;</hi> whereas the truth is, that if that deſigne had gone forward, (as it
did not) it had been to recover the <hi>Palatinate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In other things were the facts untrue, by concealing part of the truth
and the circumſtances, which do clearly juſtifie the ſaid fact; The Malice
and Fraud of the Declaration is made moſt apparent; as when they ſpeak
of <hi>ſlitting of noſes, branding of faces, cutting off eares,</hi> the facts were true; But
they conceal that all theſe things were done by courſe of Juſtice againſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
Malefactors; And ſo that which they ſhould have called Juſtice,
they now bring for an inſtance of Cruelty.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it is remarkable that all the greivances complained of through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the <hi>Kings</hi> whole Reigne, though wholy redreſſed according to their
own deſires; yet they are recharged, and the redreſſes not ſpoken of. So
likewiſe are all the Objections which they have formerly made, either of
the paſſages of the War, or concerning the Treaties; although they have by
the <hi>King</hi> been formerly fully anſwered, yet they obtrude upon the people
all the ſaid objections, and conceale from them the <hi>Kings</hi> ſatisfactory An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers;
and all this in ſo venomous and ſpitefull a language, that it is plainly
to be ſeen, that their end is to make differences irreconcileable, and the
<hi>King</hi> odious, that they may have the more colour to deſtroy Him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:117629:24"/>
It will now be neceſſary to ſpeak a few words of their other Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>viz.</hi> that a King that ſhould be culpable of thoſe Crimes ſuggeſted in
this their Declaration, may be proceeded againſt, as they do now proceed
with the King; for to that end they have written this Declaration, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining
the reaſon of their Reſolutions and Proceedings.</p>
            <p>This poſition is worſe and more dangerous then their preſent Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for that by Gods goodneſſe may ſoon have an end, but this Poſition is a
ſource, a ſeed-plot and nurcery of perpetuall Rebellions. So much hath
been written by all ſorts of Chriſtians againſt this damned Maxime, that
here it ſhall be very briefly ſpoken of, and onely ſhewed, that it is full of
Impiety, Perjury, and Treaſon.</p>
            <p>Impiety, towards God, who hath in his holy word ſo often commanded
obedience to <hi>the Powers by him ordained over us,</hi> and hath prohibited Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<hi>upon pain of Damnation;</hi> and that to Heathens, Tyrants, and Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of his Church, even to that monſter of mankind, <hi>Nero.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Perjury, by breaking ſo many Oathes, Proteſtations, and Covenants, of
bearing unto the King true faith and allegeance, of defending His Perſon
and Honour, with all His juſt Rights and Dignities.</p>
            <p>Treaſon, the levying War againſt the King, the adhering to His ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
the indeavouring to alienate the hearts of the Subject from the King,
to remove the King from the Government, or to impriſon His Perſon, to
ſubvert the Lawes, to indeavour to change the government either Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
or Civill, to reforme the King by force, and many other things are
by the Lawes, and Acts of Parliament (and not by Ordinances) declared
to be Treaſon, and moſt of them ſo confeſſed by themſelves this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be ſo; and for the pretence of ſome of them, the Arch-biſhop
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> loſt their lives. And here I ſhall
leave that damned Poſition, that Subjects may depoſe their lawfull heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
King, (for ſo the King is in effect) upon ſuggeſtions of His failings, or
any other cauſe whatſoever.</p>
            <p>It remains yet to ſpeak ſomething of the Scope of their ſo bitter railing,
and reviling of the King with ſo foul a pen, as Tyranny, Cruelty, betraying,
breach of Oaths, &amp;c. which is to make Him odious; for anſwer whereunto
there ſhalbe only offered unto the world and them, ſuch truths of the King
and his Deportments, as the fierceſt of His enemies ſhall not deny. He is
known to be a Prince of a moſt pious life, which He daily ſheweth by His
conſtant practice of all Acts of devotion, as Prayers, Sermons, and frequent
receiving of the holy Sacrament. No blood hath been drawn by his Anger
or Revenge; no noble Family diſhonoured by His Luſt; no Debauchery or
Exceſſe hath received encouragement by His Example; no Oathes or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneſſe
have been heard to come out of His mouth; His prudence, ability &amp;
invincible courage and induſtry, are not unknown to themſelves; nor His
patience and compoſedneſs of minde, in the higheſt afflictions and wrongs
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:117629:25"/>
that have ever almoſt befallen any King; and laſtly, his goodneſſe and cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
in deſiring to put all by-paſt Injuries into perpetuall oblivion.</p>
            <p>Let theſe His known and undenyable vertues, beſides His Royal De<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="4 letters">

               </gap>
Aſperſions that have been raked together againſt Him; and then let it be
judged, whether it will not be an ill change for the people, to leave the
ſubjection and Government of ſuch a Prince, to put themſelves under the
Tyrannie and Arbitrary Power of ſuch a Parliament, and ſuch an Army.</p>
            <p>One thing more ſhall onely be offered to the conſideration of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
whether if the Houſes ſhould condeſcend to a Peace, upon no more then
what the King offereth, beſides all the Conceſſions He hath granted this
Parliament, and what He hath offered from <hi>Holdenby,</hi> from <hi>Hampton Court,</hi>
and <hi>Carisbrook Caſtle</hi> (before cited,) the Engliſh Nation ſhould not be the
freeſt and happieſt Subjects in <hi>Europe.</hi> And whether if they continue under
the preſent uſurped Power of the Houſe of Commons, and the Army, (for
the Lords ſerve now onely to be ſubſervient unto them) they ſhall not be
the moſt miſerable of all people; by having their Religion, Lives, Liberties,
and Lawes changed, and to be diſpoſed of by the Wils and Arbitrary Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of their fellow-Subjects.</p>
            <p>It is againe deſired (as it hath been in the beginning of this Anſwer) that
what is herein ſet down, may onely ſtay mens judgements, and put them
into a deliberation; untill the King (who hath perfect knowledge and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of all the particulars, which in many things are wanting to the
Writer hereof) ſhall Himſelfe ſet forth His full Anſwer; which is not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be long; for that thoſe who have the worſt opinion of the Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of the Houſe of Commons, cannot ſuppoſe them to be ſo irrationall
and barbarous, as not to let the King have a ſight of this their Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and to afford Him all neceſſary means of making and publiſhing His
Anſwer.</p>
