            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Exceptions againſt <hi>William Rogers's</hi> Cavils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>TO excuſe himſelf from prevarication, where he ſaith, he hath cited my Fathers Teſtimony, <hi>All together, as it lay, Word for Word, and not by parts and pieces</hi>; he would evade the matter by ſaying, (<hi>pag.</hi> 19. of the ſaid <hi>ſixth part</hi>) that he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it <hi>part</hi> of a diſcourſe, which I grant him: But yet he gives this <hi>part</hi> of a Diſcourſe as an entire Teſtimony, calling it <hi>par.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 88. <hi>A Teſtimony, this Teſtimony,</hi> and <hi>the ſaid Teſtimony,</hi> not <hi>part</hi> of a Teſtimony; and in the next page, the Title is, <hi>The Teſtimony of the ſaid</hi> Iſaac Penington, which I urged againſt him in my <hi>Complaint,</hi> as an additional demonſtration of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairneſs, and he in his <hi>Rejoynder</hi> takes no notice of.</p>
            <p>He goes on in the ſame <hi>page,</hi> ſaying, he began <hi>at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a Paragraph, and ſo quoted about</hi> 8 <hi>or</hi> 10 <hi>Sides, without adding or diminiſhing a Word.</hi> (Why did he not tell us ſo before in his <hi>third Part</hi>; if he had no deſign of impoſing upon his Reader?) This is far from taking <hi>All as it lies,</hi> to take the middle and leave both ends, which did more immediately explain the ſenſe of the whole: And ſo his Reader would have ſeen at firſt had he expreſſed himſelf as he doth now. He would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a very unfair, dealer between man and man, that had bargained to take a Commodity all together as it lay, and yet ſhould cull out the middle. Surely the middle lies not next to hand. No, no, <hi>William,</hi> all thy Sophiſtry will not turn this off: It is too manifeſt an untruth.</p>
            <p>Again, why ſhould he take ſo much pains, to Copy our 8 or 10 Sides word for word, and at laſt leave off at the laſt Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, if he did not apprehend that Sentence would marr his Cauſe? What, could he take ſo much pains with thoſe 8 or 10 Sides, and be at laſt ſo ſpent, he could not afford to give us two
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101437:3"/>
or three Lines more, which wound up the reſt, and belonged to it? Thy <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding Reader</hi> thou appealeſt to, muſt be a very ſoft natured man, to believe thou waſt without guile herein.</p>
            <p>He ſaith, <hi>page</hi> 20.
<q>We put no conſtruction on his Fathers words; but left the Reader free without endeavouring to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any ſenſe relating to theſe words: and yet his weakneſs (if not wickedneſs) is ſo great, as to declare that my <hi>Dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> (which in reality was <hi>none</hi> at all) was not genuine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
In contradiction whereto, he but a few lines before, to manifeſt that no <hi>perverſion</hi> can be proved againſt him, quotes this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of his out of his former Book, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>Our end in citing this Teſtimony <hi>(to wit, my Father's)</hi> is that the impartial Reader may conſider whether the ſaid Teſtimony hath any coherence with that part of the Book of Government, which is objected againſt by us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
Now if citing a Teſtimony for a certain <hi>end,</hi> implies not a <hi>Deduction</hi> or <hi>Inference</hi> therefrom, I am weak indeed. What, oppoſe him to <hi>R. B.</hi> and yet make no Deduction at all? Say, <hi>J. P.</hi> ſaies thus, and <hi>R. B.</hi> thus, and no Inference in all this? Nor is it probable he would beſtow the Copying of Eight or Ten ſides upon us, without drawing any conſequence at all.</p>
            <p>And now I am upon this Subject, let me examine him yet further, and ſee whether I cannot produce more inſtances, that he hath made a <hi>Deduction,</hi> and a falſe one too, from the ſaid Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. And firſt I betake my ſelf to his <hi>Title-page</hi> of his <hi>third part,</hi> which I referred to in my <hi>Complaint,</hi> to make my Charge good. It runs thus:</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>The third part of the Chriſtian-Quaker,</hi> &amp;c. manifeſting that there is but two ſorts of Government owned by the Children of the Light, or Chriſtian-Quaker. One is, the outward Government, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The other is, the inward Government of Chriſt (who alone is Lord over the Conſcience) which is not repreſented by perſons (viſible by carnal eyes) inveſted with power from him to execute outward Laws, Preſcriptions, Orders, Edicts or Decrees in an outward form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, viſible as aforeſaid. And for the <hi>better Illuſtration</hi> of our meaning, an Anſwer to a part of <hi>R. Barclay</hi>'s Book of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is cited; to which is added <hi>a Teſtimony given forth in Print in the Year</hi> 1660. <hi>by</hi> Iſaac Penington <hi>the Younger.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:101437:3"/>From whence theſe Three Conſequences naturally flow.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Printing a Teſtimony for <hi>better Illuſtration,</hi> ſhews that that Teſtimony was to make ſome <hi>Illuſtration.</hi> Now if no <hi>Deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> or <hi>Inference</hi> were drawn therefrom, nor that it had no refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to make good his foregoing Poſition, how could it be ſaid to <hi>Illuſtrate</hi> at all?</p>
            <p n="2">2. If this Allegation of <hi>W. R</hi>'s be repugnant to my Father's ſenſe delivered in that Teſtimony, and he have laboured to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate the contrary, my charge of his <hi>Deduction not being ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine,</hi> and of his <hi>traducing, abuſing, miſ-repreſenting,</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting</hi> my Father's words, will ſtand the Teſt. Which that it is ſo, give me leave to repeat three paſſages out of the ſaid Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, whereof two of them were over-look'd, the laſt cited by <hi>W. R.</hi> himſelf. The words are theſe:</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thus the Apoſtles and other Miniſters of Chriſt, had likewiſe in the Spirit the care of the Churches, and Authority in the Lord by his Spirit to</hi> Govern <hi>the Spirits of his people</hi>—Again, <hi>Every one feeling a meaſure of the Spirit in himſelf, is thereby taught to own and Subject to a greater meaſure of the ſame Spirit in another</hi>; (ſee <hi>part</hi> 1. <hi>page</hi> 238. of my Father's Works.)</q> This is far from <hi>W. R</hi>'s Poſition, that the <hi>inward Government of Chriſt is not repreſented by perſons viſible by carnal eyes,</hi> becauſe he <hi>alone is Lord over the Conſcience,</hi> as if the Government were out of Chriſt's hands, when his Spirit and Power acts through his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. But alike truly may it be urged, that becauſe God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to <hi>teach</hi> his people himſelf, which <hi>John</hi> ſaw fulfilled when he told the Churches, <hi>Ye need not that any man teach you, but as the ſame anointing teacheth you,</hi> 1 John 1.27. therefore no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (viſible by carnal Eyes) are inveſted with power from him to <hi>teach,</hi> he being the Biſhop and Shepherd of the Soul: and ſo exclude the Office of <hi>Paſtors and Teachers,</hi> as entrenching upon Chriſt's Prerogative.</p>
            <p>Yet does <hi>W. R.</hi> himſelf (<hi>part</hi> 3. <hi>page</hi> 94.) bring in my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaying, <hi>And every Member is to wait in the meaſure of the Spirit which he hath received, to feel the going forth of the ſame Spirit in him that teacheth and Governeth; and ſo to</hi> Subject <hi>not to man, but to the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. From whence two things are obſervable (which contradict the ſcope of <hi>W. R.</hi>'s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, and manifeſt the wrong uſe he would make of my Father's Writings.) The <hi>firſt</hi> is, That the Spirit ſo goes forth in ſome, as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101437:4"/>
in them to teach and <hi>Govern</hi>; and <hi>Secondly,</hi> Thoſe that <hi>Subject</hi> to men thus qualified (which is far from denying any are ſo) Subject not to <hi>man,</hi> but to the <hi>Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. A Third conſequence which occurrs from the premiſes is, that notwithſtanding his endeavouring, <hi>page</hi> 22. to ſuggeſt my wronging him, becauſe I tell him, his <hi>Title-page imports, that the drift of that part of his Book is to tye up all to an inward Government of Chriſt, excluſive of any outward form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Order or Diſcipline:</hi> yet that from thence the ſame is very obvious. For what elſe can be the meaning of thoſe words, <hi>That the inward Government of Chriſt is not repreſented by perſons (viſible by carnal eyes) inveſted with power from him, to execute outward Laws, Preſcriptions,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in an outward form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>; if he did not intend under the Notion of inward Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Chriſt, to exclude all manner of outward form of Government, Order or Diſcipline, except he would have it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by perſons inviſible to carnal eyes.</p>
            <p>Nor have I done with him yet upon this Subject, for I muſt a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d one Inſtance more to prove he hath made Deductions and Inferences, from that which he Cited of my Fathers, which thought it be pretty long, am willing to give my Reader, for a further taſte of my Adverſaries falſe covers, and in order to my own Vindication. It begins thus:</p>
            <p>
               <q>Having now done with the Citation of what was writ in Anſwer to the aforeſaid Book of Government, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that in the Firſt Section, the Author wrote of a ſort of Perſons that would needs be <hi>Innovators,</hi> and given to change, and introducing new Doctrines and Practices, not only dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, but contrary to what were delivered in the beginning; and in <hi>page</hi> 13. ſeems reflectingly to treat on ſuch kind of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as this, <hi>I muſt ſtay till I be convinced,</hi> as if ſuch lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage was knockt down in the beginning: and as may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be taken from the ſcope of the ſaid Book, to reflect on ſuch among the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> who are not ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly affected with the outward form of Government under the Notion of Church Government, pretended to be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd amongſt them, as the Author or Approvers of his Book were: <hi>We think it neceſſary to cite a Teſtimony publiſh'd in Print, by</hi> Iſaac Penington <hi>the Younger,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:101437:4"/>If in all this there be no <hi>Deduction,</hi> when he gives ſuch a large account why he thought it neceſſary to cite my Father, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing him and Friends in the beginning, to what is received now amongſt Friends, then I confeſs I am to ſeek for the Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology of the word. Nay, doth he not tell us that his firſt Motive was, conſidering the Author wrote of a ſort of Perſons that would needs be Innovators, and introduce new Doctrine to what was in the beginning? But what then? what is that to us? or how doth it concern us, if <hi>W. R.</hi> hath made no <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction</hi> or <hi>Inference</hi> with relation to my Father's ſenſe for or againſt it, but hath left his Reader free, without <hi>putting a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction on it?</hi> which is not conſtent with telling us, that upon ſuch and ſuch Conſiderations he thought neceſſary to cite it: for this is a manifeſt declaring the conſtruction he would make of it.</p>
            <p>Another Conſideration he draws from <hi>page</hi> 13. of the ſaid Book, upon which he thought neceſſary to cite my Father's words, or at leaſt ſome of them, is, That <hi>his Author</hi> (as he alledgeth) <hi>ſeems reflectingly to treat; as if ſuch kind of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as,</hi> I muſt ſtay till I be convinced, <hi>were knocked down in the beginning.</hi> Well, what of all this? What have we to do with his <hi>Author,</hi> if there be no reference made thereto, in citing part of my Fathers words, of his allowing or diſallowing ſuch kind of Language? But then why was it brought here, as one of the Inducives to the Citation? Is not this manifeſt Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>William?</hi> Doſt thou not apparently thwart thy ſelf? Was not thy <hi>third part</hi> writ to another end, than thou wilt own in thy <hi>Sixth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he goes on with a Third Conſideration, oppoſing <hi>ſcope</hi> to <hi>ſcope,</hi> and telling us <hi>the ſcope of the ſaid Book,</hi> ſeeming to be to <hi>reflect on ſuch among the people called Quakers, who are not ſo zealouſly affected with the outward forms of Government under the Notion of Church-government, we think it neceſſary to cite a Teſtimony,</hi> &amp;c. Entituled, <hi>The Authority and Government, which Chriſt excluded out of Church,</hi> &amp;c. And what, no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction in all this neither? Doth he not hereby endeavour to inſinuate my Father's ſenſe in thoſe daies concurred not with the <hi>zealouſly affected perſons now adaies?</hi> eſpecially when we conſider that after he hath promiſed to take it <hi>all together, word for word, and not by parts and pieces here and there</hi>; yet he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101437:5"/>
left out the moſt remarkable paſſages, which could no waies admit of, but directly impugned ſuch a conſtruction, as he (notwithſtanding his endeavouring now to palliate it) ſought to wreſt therefrom.</p>
            <p>Yet further on this occaſion, I would ask him one Queſtion, <hi>Whether he himſelf be one of thoſe</hi> zealouſly affected perſons to the outward forms of Government, under the Notion of Church-Government, <hi>or no?</hi> For if he be not, he hath no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to take it ill of me, that I inferred he would <hi>tye up all to an inward Government of Chriſt, excluſive of any outward form of Government, Order or Diſcipline:</hi> and if he be, he hath an ill way of ſhewing it, when he would make Friends in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be of another mind. O the changeableneſs of this man, one while one way, another while another way; (like the fooliſh Woman) pulling down his Houſe with his own Hands! O that he could ſee whither he is run, through ſpurning at counſel, and be warned for the future!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But ſuppoſe</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>page</hi> 20.) <hi>I had not-worded my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo cautiouſly, as to have ſignified only a part of his Father's diſcourſe,</hi> &amp;c. Why hadſt thou ſo done, and ingeniouſly have confeſſed it, I would never have trod upon thee. But what if the caſe be otherwiſe, and that thy deſign was to traduce, and now thou art pinched, wouldſt ſeek a hole to creep out at, muſt not I tell thee, thy way is hedged up, and this and the other paſſage makes againſt thee. It would be well for thee, thou couldſt at length learn to diſtinguiſh between weakneſs and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, ignorance and premeditated abuſe.</p>
            <p>He adds, <hi>Might not all publick Preachers or Writers by the ſame Rule be reflected on, when they have quoted by way of Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony or Illuſtration a part only of another's Teſtimony? Anſw.</hi> Yes, if they affirm that <hi>part</hi> to be the <hi>whole,</hi> and to be taken <hi>all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as it lies, and not by parts and pieces,</hi> and wreſt that part as an inſtance of their oppoſition to their Brethren they are in unity with. The like Anſwer may ſerve for his Marginal Note, where from my citing but <hi>part</hi> of my Father's Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and not declaring 'tis only a <hi>part</hi> (ſaith he, but is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken) though I never ſaid 'twas the <hi>whole,</hi> he would prove me <hi>worthy of worſe reflections, than,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>I gave him.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:101437:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>I do alſo acknowledge that ſome paſſages of my Fathers, quoted even by <hi>W. R,</hi> do make againſt <hi>W. R,</hi> nor do I wonder at it, he being not the firſt Adverſary by many, that hath given occaſion to be beaten with his own weapon.</p>
            <p>What he terms, <hi>page</hi> 21. <hi>undeſerved reflections,</hi> as if I and others had our <hi>Educations at</hi> Billingſgate <hi>among the Scolds,</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn as frothy, envious and unſavoury; who though I had a juſt diſreliſh of the man's unworthineſs, yet wrote thoſe lines in great calmneſs and ſerenity of mind, and was never ſcurrilous to him in my language; nor yet ſharp, but where my matter ſpoke for me. And better were it for him to clear himſelf of my Charge of <hi>dealing fallaciouſly, ſurreptitiouſly, and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,</hi> than to term it <hi>Billingſgate</hi> language, which I believe he never heard there.</p>
            <p>In the ſame page he quibbles at my ſaying, <hi>He leapt over ſome leaves Explanatory of the reſt,</hi> as if it were Non-ſenſe, but it is true enough, for the beginning ſhews the occaſion of what followed, and ſurely a <hi>Queſtion</hi> and the firſt part of an <hi>Anſwer,</hi> muſt needs be <hi>explanatory</hi> of the reſt of the <hi>Anſwer</hi>: as well as that it did not become one who promiſed to take it <hi>all, as it lay,</hi> to begin his quotation with the latter part of the <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Surely by this means his quotation, whatever he pretend (ſee <hi>page</hi> 21.) <hi>cannot reaſonably be termed Explanatory of what did precede,</hi> but what did precede might open that which did ſuc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
            <p>Now to that laſt clauſe of my Father's, which he left out, he (after he hath told me he made no Deduction from it, of which let the unbyaſſed judge) urgeth in excuſe, that the <hi>words are</hi> Prophetical, <hi>ſignifying what</hi> will <hi>come to paſs, not what</hi> was <hi>come to paſs,</hi> page 21. and adds in the next page, <hi>Since the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of my citing his Father's words, was only in relation to a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe touching what had been, I ſhould have ſhewn my ſelf very impertinent, to quote his words</hi> Prophetically <hi>ſpoken.</hi> O <hi>William,</hi> this is a falſe gloſs in God's ſight, and I fear thou belyeſt thy own Conſcience herein: for how can it be ſaid to <hi>Propheſie</hi> what <hi>ſhall</hi> be, any more than to tell what <hi>hath</hi> been? The words are theſe, <hi>And the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity being thus kept, all will come into one</hi> outwardly <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo at length, as the Light grows in every one, and as every one grews into the Light,</hi> &amp;c. which is as much as to ſay, This is the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tendency and effect of keeping the Unity, both where it

               <hi>hath been</hi> as well as where it <hi>is</hi> kept. And what Prophecy is there in all this? Cannot he diſtinguiſh between a conſequence upon a thing premiſed, and a prediction, or foretelling a thing to come from the Mouth of the Lord? But he would fain have it ſo, which if it were granted, would neither help his cauſe, nor leſſen his guilt, in leaving out the laſt Sentence, when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to give us <hi>all together word for word</hi>: For how ſhall that (which he terms a <hi>Prophecy</hi>) be fulfilled, if the means be rejected and withſtood? How ſhall <hi>all come into one outwardly alſo at length,</hi> if the <hi>diverſities of adminiſtrations, gifts and operations</hi> (which jar not, are not contrary though various; for the ſame fountain cannot ſend forth ſweet water and bitter) I ſay, how ſhall it be effected if theſe <hi>Diverſities</hi> muſt be urged, as oppoſing the breaking forth of <hi>that day (W. R</hi> ſayes, <hi>He ſhould rejoyce to ſee) wherein we might all ſo be led by the appearance of Chriſts ſpirit in us, under his Government,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as that this oneneſs might be witneſſed among all the Families of Gods people?</hi> See <hi>par.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 83. To what end ſhould theſe things be propheſied of, if none are to preſs after the mark, or that diverſities of Gifts, wrought by the ſame Spirit, hinder this work? What is this but to ſay, the Spirit of God, through bringing forth theſe diverſities of Gifts and Operations in the body, obſtructs that <hi>oneneſs,</hi> which his <hi>Soul ſhould rejoyce to ſee?</hi> O Confuſion! O Darkneſs, that may be felt!</p>
            <p>I wave the reflection and Marginal Note that followes, <hi>pag.</hi> 22. on <hi>G.

            <p>Now to come to his <hi>Obſervations on what is Written in Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to my Mother</hi> M.P. which he toucheth very lightly, and wholly waves my <hi>Poſtſcript,</hi> which ſummed up the thing.</p>
            <p>He begins <hi>pag.</hi> 23. thus,
<q>The Title Page imports, <hi>That I have ſuggeſted that</hi> Mary Penington <hi>did ſhun ſuffering for Truth.</hi> 'Tis a very falſe Repreſentation of what I have ſaid concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning her: For there cannot be a ſhunning of Suffering for Truth, unleſs one ſhun that Suffering which Truth requires, which <hi>I never did charge</hi> Mary Penington <hi>with.</hi>
               </q>
And yet in <hi>pag.</hi> 5. he ſaith,
<q>Witneſs his (<hi>viz. G. F</hi>'s) advice to <hi>Mary Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington</hi> to ſecure Worldly Eſtate from the Spoiler, when 'twas likely to be ſeized for obedience to Chriſts Commands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:101437:6"/>
What is Suffering <hi>for Obedience to Chriſts Command,</hi> no Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>for Truth?</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But hear him once more at the letter end of <hi>pag.</hi> 23. and <hi>pag.</hi> 24.
<q>We cannot forſake the Aſſembling of our ſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and in purſuance of Chriſts command we cannot ſwear, <hi>and in BOTH THESE our Teſtimony for Truth is concerned:</hi> And therefore I cannot but conclude, that as it related to avoid Sufferings, by reaſon of obedience to Chriſts Command, <hi>George Fox</hi>'s Counſel to her was not juſtifiable in him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
Here's ſtrange work, ſay and unſay, give and take; one while, <hi>I never did charge</hi> Mary Penington <hi>with ſhunning that Suffering which Truth Requires</hi>; another while, <hi>Suffering for not Swearing, is Suffering for Truth, as well as Suffering for Meeting:</hi> Even now, <hi>It was a very falſe Repreſentation to ſay, he ſuggeſted</hi> M. P. <hi>did ſhun Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for Truth</hi>: Anon, <hi>He cannot but conclude, that as it related to avoid Sufferings by reaſon of obedience to Chriſts command,</hi> G. F<hi>'s Counſel to her was not juſtifiable in him.</hi> O whither doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice and envy carry men? What blindneſs is happned to him, thus to grope at Noon-day? and ſo palpably to lay himſelf open to the laſh of every half-ſighted Reader?</p>
            <p>But to return to <hi>pag.</hi> 23. where he ſaith, <hi>G. F's Paper of Queries reflects ſo far as Queries could, on ſuch as ſecured any part of their Eſtates from the Spoiler.</hi> What upon any Conſideration whatever? Conſult them again. (Or did thy <hi>Credible Friend in Truth</hi> inform thee ſo: Bring out thy Informer, and let us know) Did he imply 'tis in no Caſe lawful to ſecure an Eſtate from the Spoiler, without any limitation what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever? What, not from a Thief, nor from a man that claims by a falſe Title? For he told us but a Line or two above, that my Mothers Suffering was not a Suffering for Truth in his account; and conſequently he could not mean that. But then he muſt needs wrong <hi>G. F.</hi> exceedingly whoſe words in thoſe <hi>Queries</hi> (as himſelf ſets them down, <hi>par.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 24.) are,
<q>All you that do make away or over your Eſtates for fear of the Spoilers in time of Perſecution, <hi>for the ſake of Chriſt and his Goſpel, and the Worſhip of God,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
And to this effect he ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>preſſeth himſelf over and over in thoſe <hi>Queries.</hi> So that if he ſhould ſee he hath overſhot himſelf, and would recal his words again: Yet he ought (as <hi>Tho. Lawrence</hi> told him) to explain how much Goods may be hid, what ſort of Goods, who may
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101437:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
do it, and in what caſes it may, in what it may not be done, or he confounds things.</p>
            <p>Yet to open the thing more plainly, I will take the pains to repeat the ſubſtance of that part of my <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> in my <hi>Complaint,</hi> which handles this matter, that thou mayeſt ſee <hi>G. F.</hi> allows not in one, what he diſallowes in another, as</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>My Mother was not the perſon under Proſecution for the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Nor did ſhe go to ſecure her Eſtate from any Proſecution againſt her upon that account.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>It was a Trapan; and the occaſion not from any ſuppoſed Offence of my Fathers; relating to Religious Worſhip, but a Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem to the Eſtate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>My Mother ſecured not my Fathers Eſtate, but her own, in order to ſave the right of Poſſeſſion in her own hands, from any ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal ſeizure; which was her ſole property, and not ſeizable for my Fathers pretended Offence, which is no ways parallel to any ones making over their own proper Eſtate, to ſhun ſuffering for their own particular Teſtimony in Meeting to Worſhip God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This he never touches upon, nor endeavours to invalid, but jumbles things confuſedly together to darken the thing; for this ſhewing what <hi>G. F.</hi> ſmote at, and ſtating your two Caſes, as they are, ſerved not his turn. And now I am paſt wondring that I find him an unfair Adverſary, for he hath inured me to expect no other.</p>
            <p>He adds,
<q>Whereas <hi>Mary Penington</hi> hath accuſed me, that I have Aſperſed Innocent Servants of the Lord, and have brought forth nothing to prove that I have ſo done; I return it as a falſe Charge, unbecoming the Pen of one that pretends to an Innocent and Righteous Converſation, as ſhe doth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Their being manifeſt to her Conſcience in the ſight of God to be his Faithful Servants (had ſhe no other ground for what ſhe ſaith) is an undenyable proof with her, that they are no <hi>Lyars, Double-minded men, Forgers of Falſe-Certificates,</hi> &amp;c. with many other Scandals caſt upon ſuch, whom <hi>W.

            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:101437:7"/>I muſt alſo tell him, that though he be offended at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof given him under the Inſtances of <hi>Ham,</hi> &amp;c. (of which he treats largely from <hi>pag.</hi> 5. to 9.) yet they are very pat, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their force ſtill: Nor will his flinging dirt on <hi>G. F.</hi> in a thing he cannot prove, but brings Certificates under the hands of ſuch as are parties againſt him, take off the edge of the blow. For if <hi>Ham</hi> was not to take advantage of a real weakneſs againſt his Father, even before his Brethren (though <hi>Noah</hi> being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with Wine, did what was unſeemly) how can <hi>W. R.</hi> be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed in expoſing the pretended failings of an Elder or Elders, (whom he ought to <hi>entreat as Fathers,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.1.) to both Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Adverſaries: For let him ſay what he will, that'twas never his <hi>Practice, Order or Advice to publiſh it amongſt Prieſts, pag.</hi> 8. Yet it is plain from the Book it ſelf, and objections he obviated, not to be ſtarted by any Friend, that it was deſigned to go abroad among <hi>Foes</hi> as well as <hi>Friends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to the inſtance of <hi>Davids</hi> care to conceal <hi>Saul</hi>'s death (who was his Enemy, and had loſt his condition God ward) from the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſed,</hi> leſt they ſhould inſult over <hi>Iſrael</hi>; it anſwers the matter in hand, notwithſtanding his labour to evade it, and extenuate his offence. And how <hi>W. R.</hi> whatever Name he arrogate to himſelf, can be a <hi>Chriſtian-Quaker,</hi> while he endeavours thus to beſpatter the people he joyns himſelf to, and would be taken to be one of, and not a falſe Brother, to me ſeems a Paradox. For if the <hi>Quakers</hi> are ſo and ſo with thee, <hi>Be ſeperate, go out from among them, renounce the Name</hi> Quaker, <hi>aſſume another Name to thy ſelf</hi>; and do not keep with them; Meet with them as one of them, and call thy ſelf a <hi>Quaker,</hi> yea a <hi>Chriſtian-Quaker</hi> too; and yet ſay, they are not Gods <hi>Iſrael.</hi> O this is ſhameful among men! and they will be ready to ſay, <hi>It is an ill Bird that bewrays his own Neſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 9. <hi>That</hi> Saul <hi>acknowledged his ſin, and prayed that his ſin might be taken away,</hi> &amp;c. Thereby rendring him a better man than <hi>G.

(the laſt place where any mention is made of <hi>Saul,</hi> before that of his falling upon <hi>Mount Gilboa</hi>) and then thou wilt ſee he had ſo provoked the Lord, and was ſo much another man to what thou rendreſt him, that the Lord would not Anſwer him either <hi>by Dreams,</hi> or <hi>by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim,</hi> or <hi>by the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101437:8"/>
Prophets,</hi> ſo that he ſought to a <hi>Witch,</hi> and the Anſwer <hi>Samuel</hi> made, gives no Character of <hi>Saul</hi>'s acceptance with God, but foretells his overthrow. What Repentance was there in all this? O <hi>William,</hi> had <hi>G. F.</hi> made ſuch a lame and falſe deduction, wouldſt not thou have made work with it; <hi>But thy Folly muſt be made manifeſt.</hi> And ſeeing thou inſiſts ſo on 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.24, 25. I am to tell thee, it makes not at all for thee, nor gives any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Gods accepting <hi>Saul</hi> again; but only that through his importunity <hi>Samuel</hi> was prevailed with to turn again after him and Worſhip the Lord, that <hi>Saul</hi> might not be diſhonoured be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Elders of the people, as <hi>v.</hi> 30, 31. nay the laſt verſe of that Chapter, and the firſt of the next do imply the contrary.</p>
            <p>And for a further juſtifying himſelf in publiſhing pretended miſcarriages to the World, he urgeth that <hi>Paul</hi> did the like by <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>ſaid unto him before all men, if thou being a Jew,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>pag.</hi> 5. But how doth he underſtand that word <hi>all men</hi>? Was it not <hi>all that Auditory,</hi> before whom the offence was given? And was it not fitting he ſhould do ſo? Is this parallel to <hi>W. R</hi>'s Caſe? Doth this juſtify publiſhing Offences in Print among Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, not otherwiſe privy to it? Beſides he cannot prove that that Auditory conſiſted of a mixt number of Believers and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. It might, for ought he knows, be only an Aſſembly of ſuch as were at leaſt convinced, and the miſcarriage being ſo publick, the reproof ought to be ſo too. Again, where did he meet with that Tranſlation <hi>all men</hi>: My Bible hath it <hi>them all,</hi> nor is the word <hi>Men</hi> in the <hi>Greek</hi>; it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> before all, or them all; which very thing ſhews clearly, that he did not go to ſow Diſſention among the Churches, or hinder the paſſage of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Miniſtry among Unbelievers, that had no knowledge of the offence, and ſo not lyable to be ſtumbled or hurt thereby; for then it had been ſuitable to <hi>W. R</hi>'s caſe and practice.</p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>Thomas Criſp</hi> and himſelf have publiſh'd that as <hi>Edward Burroughs,</hi> which, though each of them hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in Print ſince, and that I publickly required them to make it good; yet neither of them hath either confeſſed their fault, or made good their Allegation herein, I muſt needs tell him as I did <hi>T. C. That it greatly detects the meanneſs of his Spirit, and ſhews the little regard he hath to deal juſtly and equally with thoſe he oppoſeth:</hi> ſo unfair an Adverſary is he.

Beſides that it is an injury to the memory of <hi>E.

            <p>To Conclude, As this work is a work of Darkneſs, ſo is the <hi>peace</hi> that attends it, and which he ſo much boaſts of, the <hi>peace</hi> which is obtained when the <hi>ſtrong man Armed keeps the Houſe</hi> (or rather when he re-entreth with <hi>ſeven worſe Spirits</hi> then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) from which <hi>peace,</hi> the Lord keep all that have not ſinned out their day.</p>

The reſt is made up moſtly of bitterneſs againſt <hi>G. F.</hi> and an eſpouſing <hi>J.S.</hi> and <hi>J.W</hi>'s Cauſe; who are men I believe,

he would not have been concerned in or for; nor taken notice of, had they not run out from Truth. For what ſhould make him, that hath ſo long been Luke-warm and unfaithful, and not look'd upon (by Faithful Friends who well know him) as a Friend for years, be ſo vigorous to ſtand by theſe men, were it not that their way is broad enough to receive him, though the Truth is too ſtrait for him!</p>
            <p>Yet how he can be a proper Advocate for their Cauſe, who would have a <hi>liberty</hi> (while in the profeſſion of the Truth) <hi>to pay Tythes, Marry with a Prieſt, and uſe the language Truth diſowns,</hi> while <hi>J. S.</hi> and <hi>J.W.</hi> have endeavoured to inſinuate the contrary, as their Doctrine and Practice, I confeſs I ſee not, unleſs that to oppoſe Truth be a COMMON CAUSE.</p>
            <p>And whereas he is ſo bitter, Prophane and flouting, ſpeaking of <hi>Foxonians,</hi> G. F's <hi>Laws,</hi> G. F's <hi>Orders,</hi> which he terms, <hi>The High Hedge or Wall, your Idol,</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>page</hi> 2, 3, 7. and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; it would be well he would exhibit to the World a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of thoſe Laws, Orders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that we may ſee whether they are things that are <hi>Honeſt, Juſt, Pure, Lovely, of good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> and whether there be <hi>any Vertue or praiſe in them,</hi> Phil. 4.8. (or the contrary): for then they deſerve no Epithites of Reproach and Obloquy, which he is very liberal of throughout his Book: as where he brands the proceedings and tender Admonitions given to <hi>J. S.</hi> and <hi>J. W.</hi> in order to reclaim them, and bring them to a ſight of their decline, with the Nick-name of <hi>Popery, Impoſition, Pope's Bull,</hi> &amp;c. adding that <hi>many bleſs God; ſome of them have no power to Mulct or corporally puniſh.</hi> (See <hi>page</hi> 9, and 10.) which are as black and malicious Charges as he can well caſt, rendring Friends obnoxious to the Government, and bereft of humanity, and that from a man, that can have the face to call himſelf a Quaker too, as <hi>page</hi> 11. O the impiety<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>! O the Obduracy, and Treachery of theſe men, that while they aſſume the name of Quaker, would proſtitute the Cauſe of Truth to the fury of its Adverſaries! Surely <hi>their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is fierce, and their wrath is cruel,</hi> Gen. 49.7.</p>
