         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Advice that is given
here, is of two ſorts; one
is general, and regards all
ſorts of Perſons of whatſoever Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
they are, without medling
with their particular Employments
and Actions; the other is particular,
and conſiders what ordinarily oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs
in the Affairs of the World.</p>
            <p>It is cettain, both the one and
the other will not be unprofitable;
and the Methods of inſinuating it
into the Minds of the Reader, will
not be diſagreeable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:38480:3"/>
It is a Father that gives Advice
to his Children to make them wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of the Name and Family from
which they come; and it is for that
Reaſon that all the Counſels deſign
to inſpire them with Sentiments of
Honour and Probity.</p>
            <p>It is a Father that throughly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands
the World, and deſires
that his Children ſhould be truly Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
and Religious, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
for an affected and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Devotion; and who deſires at
the ſame time, that their Religion
ſhould not hinder them from having
all the Qualities requiſite to make
them eſteemed and beloved of all
they converſe with.</p>
            <p>It is a Father that joining the
Light of Religion with that which
a long and conſummated Experience
in the Affairs of the World hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb facs="tcp:38480:3"/>
him, makes uſe both of the one
and the other, to make his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to be diſtinguiſhed by their
Chriſtian and their Moral Virtues.</p>
            <p>All that he ſpeaks to them, is to
ſubdue the Irregularities of their
Minds and Manners, and to teach
them to lead their Lives contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in all the Troubles that their
Employments and Buſineſs may give
them. His manner of ſpeaking
conciſely and in few Words, he thinks
to be the beſt means to make an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
upon their Minds, and the
Truth is laid naked, and embraced for
its own ſake; in effect it is made
more familiar, being coucht in few
Words, and makes a more lively and
natural impreſſion upon the Mind.</p>
            <p>I know that the Book which
Monſieur <hi>Hoquette</hi> hath writ upon
the ſame Subject, has been receiv'd
<pb facs="tcp:38480:4"/>
with a general Applauſe; and that
all Men of Wit, Learning, and
Probity, have had it in great eſteem;
heretofore I have read it with Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and found it ſo well and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately
writ; that I muſt affirm,
that I have ſeen nothing of that kind
for its ſolidity and compoſure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
to it; I have yet an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
and advantagious Idea of it
in my Mind: But it is ſo long ſince
that Book has been writ, that it is
now ſcarce to be found, and I thought
that a little Novelty would not be
diſpleaſing. I add, that there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be too much written upon this
Subject, becauſe it is ſo generally
profitable; and if I have had the
ſame end that Monſieur <hi>Hoquett</hi>
had, I have certainly made uſe of
different means to come to that end.</p>
            <p>I have but an imperfect, though
<pb facs="tcp:38480:4"/>
a noble Idea of his Book ſo that I
cannot make any advantage of what
he has writ, and much leſs can I
make uſe of what he has thought.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monſieur le Count de Buſſy
Raboutin,</hi> to name him is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to praiſe him; he is ſo well
known by his Merit, that all the
Learned, without conteſt, place him
in the number of thoſe that have
made themſelves the moſt admired
and diſtinguiſhed by their Writings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monſieur Raboutin,</hi> I ſay, has
writ a Diſcourſe to his Children,
which has been receiv'd; it is enough
to ſay, like his other Works. But how
Elegant and Excellent ſoever his
Book may be, I hope I may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to ſay, that he hath not ſaid
all that may be ſaid of the Subject,
but ſomething new of my own
Thoughts may be added. Moreover
<pb facs="tcp:38480:5"/>
the Method I have uſed in treating
of this matter is ſo different from
his, that I could not chuſe but pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
my Thoughts upon this Subject.
My little Work was ſcarce begun, but
his appear'd in the World, but that
did not make me change my Deſign,
but I follow'd my own way, and at
length have arriv'd at the end I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>

is to be perſwaded, that a quiet life paſſed in

                  <p>MY Dear Children, I know a Man of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
who paſſes for an Inſolent and Proud
Man with thoſe that do not know him; and I
aſſure you that never Man was leſs ſo than he;
his fine Liveries, his ſplendid Equipage, and
number of Servants, and his high looks do him
wrong; when a Man is acquainted with him,
he finds him upon all occaſions very civil, fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar,
and obliging, and one half Hours Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
gives the lie to all theſe appearances, and
deſtroys all the prejudices a Man has entertain'd
of him. I ſpeak not of this Man, but to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
in you ſuch Qualities, that you are not
proud but of your Birth, good Behaviour and
Merit; and that theſe Advantages ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be maintain'd by your Civility and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance
with all the World; and that this

therefore the Advice I have to give you upon
this point, is, that you always preſerve, as you
do, ſuch an outward Deportment as they ought

to have that are well Born, and that it always
be accompanied with a civility that appears

                  <p>I ſhall conclude this Article with the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Father of the Church, that ſays, that
it is not Death that is terrible, but the Opinion
that a Man has of it: And he adds, that to
die is not to be feared, but to live in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
fear of Death is that which makes it ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible;
this Fear is not cauſed but by the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of our Life, and is never found in a

this diſcreet Man who never ſpoke a Secret,
upon a ſudden becomes like the Servant in <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi>

This Perſon becomes an Echo which

                  <p>Friends ought to keep the ſame Silence, and

that by imprudence or Revenge they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
