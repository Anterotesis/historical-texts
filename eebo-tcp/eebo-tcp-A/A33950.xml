            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>BUT stay refined Soul! oh! Why so fast?</l>
               <l>Stop her you Clouds; the Worl'ds in no such haste</l>
               <l>To be undone: 'Tis hardly break of day,</l>
               <l>And will She set so soon; so soon away?</l>
               <l>You bright Intelligences, doth she stay</l>
               <l>To hear your rowling Musique by the Way</l>
               <l>Set to her charming numbers; Wherein she</l>
               <l>Distill'd the Quintessence of Poesie?</l>
               <l>Or doth she bayte at the Chrystalline Skye?</l>
               <l>We'l on the Wings of adoration flye</l>
               <l>And follow her, and leave this gloomy shade</l>
               <l>Which doth our sad Horizon thus invade;</l>
               <l>Now She hath snatch'd with her all Vertue's light,</l>
               <l>And left the World invol'vd in endlesse Night.</l>
               <l>She, who in Tragique buskins drest the Stage,</l>
               <l>Taught Honour, Love, and Friendship to this Age;</l>
               <l>Is gone to act her Part in bright attire,</l>
               <l>With Scenes of Glory, in th' Angeli<expan>

                  </expan> Quire.</l>
               <l>She Taught the World the sweet and peaceful Arts</l>
               <l>Of blending Souls, and of compounding hearts;</l>
               <l>Without th'ingredients of reserv'd intents,</l>
               <l>Hypocritics, and windy complements.</l>
               <l>She taught a Way, and that a glorious one,</l>
               <l>Not how to gain, but be above a Throne:</l>
               <l>Self-conquest is more glory, than to ride</l>
               <l>In <hi>Roman</hi> Triumphs, with <hi>Aemilian</hi> Pride.</l>
               <l>Her inward Pomp, through her Fleshy Shrowd</l>
               <l>Did like the Sun oft glitter thorough a Cloud.</l>
               <l>Her Vertues were in Conversation drawn,</l>
               <l>And shew like Arras, through transparent Laun.</l>
               <l>But ah! her Friend, that in her Bosom came,</l>
               <l>Lay wrapt in Spices, in a purer Flame</l>
               <l>Than that the <hi>Phaenix</hi> dyes in. Now she's gone!</l>
               <l>Here, <hi>Plato!</hi> here's thy wish't for Vision!</l>
               <l>When she put off her Clay, thou might'st have seen</l>
               <l>Vertue undrest, just like a Naked Queen.</l>
               <l>Thou would'st not then contemplate any more</l>
               <l>Thy Dusky vain <hi>Idea,</hi> nor would'st pore</l>
               <l>On such fictitious Bliss; but here should'st ply</l>
               <l>The summe of thy Divine Philosophy.</l>
               <l>But is she gone, said I? It cannot be;</l>
               <l>She who espous'd all Immortality:</l>
               <l>But read her Lines, you'd think that such a Soul</l>
               <l>Could her Imperious Destiny controul:</l>
               <l>That so Sublime, so brave a Mind, could soon</l>
               <l>Vault o're that Fate, that rules below the Moon.</l>
               <l>Ah! t'must not be! <hi>Death</hi> vizards Humane Glory,</l>
               <l>And writes a period to the finest Story.</l>
               <l>This Prodigie of Nature now is gone,</l>
               <l>And left Us wrapt in Admiration</l>
               <l>That she could dye; as we 're before to see</l>
               <l>That such Perfection in her Sex could be.</l>
               <l>As for her Name, let that b' inshrin'd above</l>
               <l>In some Bright Temple, of Caelestial Love;</l>
               <l>Whither our Winged Thoughts may often stray,</l>
               <l>As Soaring Pilgrims Adoration pay.</l>
               <l>And whilest her Sparkling Soul is Orb'd in Light,</l>
               <l>And reads her old <hi>Ideas</hi> in more bright</l>
               <l>And fair Impressions, in th' <hi>Aetherial</hi> Mind,</l>
               <l>Than those brief Copies that she left behind:</l>
               <l>We will commit her ever Sacred Dust</l>
               <l>Not to the Marble's, but <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Trust.</l>
               <l>And <hi>Poets</hi> Ghosts shall from <hi>Elizium</hi> come,</l>
               <l>To hear Bright Angels warble in her Tomb</l>
               <l>Her high-born Songs; which hence shall Envy fan,</l>
               <l>And Soaring Fame shall be her Guardian.</l>
               <l>Instead of Tapers, where shall ever burn</l>
               <l>Th'inflamed Hearts of Lovers in her Urn.</l>
               <l>And since our short-wing'd Pray'rs are come too late,</l>
               <l>And she must bow to th' Tyranny of Fate;</l>
               <l>Her Noble Thoughts, that fixt on bravest Theams,</l>
               <l>Shall vapour forth in Sublimated Streams</l>
               <l>Of Honour; Which Heroique Breasts shall draw,</l>
               <l>Whose Swords and Pens must give the World a Law.</l>
               <l>Her Sacred Dust, calcin'd by Time, shall be</l>
               <l>The Richest Filings of high Poesie.</l>
               <l>And from her Brain, and Muses Tears, shall spring,</l>
               <l>Posies for each chast Lovers Wedding Ring.</l>
               <l>Her all disperst, at last shall meet in one,</l>
               <l>And shine a Glorious Constellation.</l>
