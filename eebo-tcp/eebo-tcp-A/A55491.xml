            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p n="3">3. What is it to deny the power of godlineſs? <hi>Anſw</hi> Not verbally ſo much as really and actually, not with the lip, but with the life, not in word but in work: when men deſtroy in practice what they hold out in profeſſion, as <hi>Tit. 1. 16. but in works they deny him,</hi> which they dare not do perhaps with their mouths; and as he, 1 <hi>Tim. 5. 8. hath denied the faith,</hi> that is, in not making proviſion for his family, though he ſtill maintain a profeſſion of the Faith.

               <p>Becauſe 1. of the <hi>Cuſtom</hi> of a Religious Education. The bringing up of ſome in commonly-received truths doth ſo accuſtom the mind to them, that they know not how to deny them. See 2 <hi>Kin. 12. 2. Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſh</hi> was a hopefull Prince while that good Prieſt <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoiadah</hi> was alive, but when he was dead, and his head laid in the grave, <hi>Jehoaſh</hi> diſcovered himſelf what he was; thus children, ſervants, pupils, under a good Parent, Maſter, Tutor, ſeem to be Religious: But a Swine is a cleanly creature while it grazeth in a fair green meadow or field; but if once it get out, it ſhews its Swiniſh nature by wallowing in the mire: ſo eating doth uſually ſo accuſtom the palate to ſome kinde of meat, that it cannot but receive that food. <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas</hi> had religious education under their good old Father <hi>Eli;</hi> therefore they ſacrificed ſtill, though all <hi>Iſrael</hi> rang of their lewdneſs. See 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 13. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>2. Becauſe of the <hi>Clamour</hi> of a natural conſcience if awake (though never ſo ignorant and injudicious) which doth egg on to Religion: now conſcience muſt

If any man will be my diſciple</hi> (in power as well inform, in truth as well as in title) <hi>let him deny himſelf:</hi> An hard Leſſon! Its an hard matter to deny a friend, if he be importunate; an harder to deny a dear wife that lies in the boſom, if ſhe be earneſt; hardeſt of all, to deny a mans ſelf, if ſelf be earneſt. Now becauſe holineſs and happineſs are attained with ſo much difficulty, therefore ſome take on them the form of godlineſs, and are reſolved to deny the power of it. The Form is eaſie, but the power is hard and difficult.</p>

While <hi>Paul</hi> was a Phariſee, a Formal Profeſſor, he was quiet, but now when he was turned on Chriſts ſide, every Tavern rings of <hi>Paul,</hi> every tongue talks of him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully. There was a man (as I have read or heard) that was huſpled (as we ſay) in Court for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hear Sermons out of his Pariſh Church: While (ſaid he) I was a drunkard, ſwearer, &amp;c. I was quiet: and if this be the fruit of gadding to Sermons, fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well Religion, ſaid the poor Wretch. But to give you a better inſtance, we read of a Fellow that pretended

to be a Diſciple of Chriſt, but when Chriſt told him, <note n="o" place="margin">Mat. 8. 19, 20.</note> 
                  <hi>The Foxes have holes, the birds of the ayr have neſts, but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head:</hi> we read not one word more of him. There was another man, <note n="p" place="margin">Mat. 19. 16. 22.</note> that asked Chriſt the <hi>way to eternal life,</hi> when Chriſt bad him <hi>ſell all, &amp;c. the young man went away ſorrowfull</hi> at that hard ſaying; which yet was a command of conviction, not of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. <hi>Antigonus</hi> ſaid, If a man knew the Cares that attend a Crown, he would not ſtoop down to take it up, though he found it in the way, walking. Surely ſome know the hatred that the power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is attended with, and therefore are reſolved againſt it: Truth it ſelf hath ſaid, <hi>Mat. 10. 22. Ye ſhall be hated of all men for my names ſake;</hi> therefore they go away, and ſay, with thoſe on another ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, <hi>Joh 6. 60. This is an hard ſaying.</hi>

               <p>3. It is <hi>aſſaulted</hi> with Satanical temptations; The Devil knows, the power of holineſs will bring to everlaſting happineſs, and therefore out of pure ſpite he aſſaulteth ſuch a ſoul. <note n="q" place="margin">Mat. 16. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>The gates of hell,</hi> that is, the power and policy of Satan (for power and policy were in the gates, where the perſons in Judicatory were wont to meet and ſit) may aſſail, though <hi>not prevail. Pharaoh</hi> muſtered up his Army, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> was gone out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and were marching towards <hi>Canaan.</hi> Pyrats will not ſet upon an empty Pinnace, but a Merchants Ship laden with gold and ſilver, and rich commodities from the Indies. A Thief will not break into an empty barn, but into an houſe furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with good houſhold-ſtuff, and money. Now carnal men are told of this, and therefore they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved againſt the power of godlineſs.</p>

                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:63963:9"/>
3. For both together. Some have a form of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, but deny the power thereof.</p>
               <p>Becauſe of 1. The <hi>Wofull</hi> depravation of mans cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted nature. It is agreeable to mans naughty heart to have a form, and to deny the power of godlineſs. He hath in him ſo much imperfect goodneſs as that makes him to receive the Form of holineſs, and yet withall ſo much predominant badneſs, as makes him to deny the power of holineſs. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12. 2. a double heart. An heart in ſhew for God and goodneſs, an heart indeed for ſin and Satan, as that man of ſin is rightly called Antichriſt; the Praepoſition <note n="r" place="margin">

               <p>2. The <hi>Wily</hi> diſpoſition of Satan, who is very bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to water and cheriſh the ſeeds of Formality of godlineſs, and of enmity againſt the power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. He was a glorious Angel by Creation, and is become an ugly Devil by his defection, and being fallen from heaven, he maligns the happineſs of poor ſouls. He is therefore content that men ſhould carry Gods Livery on their backs, ſo that they will wear his favour in their boſoms. He is content that men ſhould be Gods ſervants in ſhew, ſo that they will be his ſlaves indeed. Thus it was with <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> 
                  <note n="s" place="margin">Act 5. 1. 2, 3, &amp;c.</note> who ſeemed to be as forward and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Chriſtians as the beſt, but out of baſe fear and diffidence, leaſt they ſhould want in their old age, kept back part of the price, being ſaid therefore to be filled with Satan: this is that ſpirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 3. that works effectually in the children of diſobedience.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63963:9"/>
The heart is the Fort-royall, and if he can keep that, he cares not much for the outworks.</p>
               <p>3. The <hi>Wiſe</hi> diſpenſation of God, who doth juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſh a number of men that live within the pale of the Church, giving them up to <hi>Satan,</hi> and to their own naughty hearts to be deluded with new forms, that he might avenge himſelf on them for neglecting the ſeaſons of grace, and rejecting the blood of Chriſt tendred in the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Theſ. 2. 11. He gave them up to ſtrong deluſion.</hi> Rom. 1. 18. <hi>who hold</hi> (im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon and impound) <hi>the truth in unrighteouſneſs.</hi> God doth this holily and juſtly, but man unholily and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly.</p>
               <p>Information. 1. There is a godlineſs not only in words <note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 1.</note> and complements, but in deed and in truth. There is good coyn, though ſome bad. There is a faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. a Love without diſſimulation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 9. wiſdom without hypocriſie, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 17. an obedience from the heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 17.</p>
               <p>2. The goodneſs and excellency of Religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the worſt of men will have the form of it. That muſt needs be good (it was wont to be ſaid) that <hi>Nero</hi> perſecuted; and godlineſs muſt be good, when vile men aſſume the form of it. There was ſure ſome worth in <hi>Samuel,</hi> in whoſe mantle and likeneſs the Devil appeared: Gold and ſilver are pretious things becauſe they are counterfeited. Wiſdom is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal thing, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 7. and wiſdom is good with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 11. and it is ſad alſo without it. Men may hate in heart to be reformed in their life, when yet they take Gods Covenant in their mouths, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 16, 17.</p>

3.

ver. 4. <hi>and yet have a form of godlineſs.</hi> Such were thoſe Iſraelites who are called Rulers of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and people of <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> Iſa. 1. 10. to 16. Such were they mentioned, <hi>Jer. 7. 9, 10.

Its good therefore to try whether we be not the men and women having but a Form.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, I muſt premiſe theſe Rules or Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is not ſimply ſinful to have a form. All ſhews of Religion are not unwarrantable, but where there is no ſubſtance. Though all is not gold that gliſters, yet true gold will gliſter. A man cannot carry a candle in a Lanthorn (except a dark one) but the light will be ſeen through the horns of it. There is a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Proverb, Three things cannot be kept in, <hi>viz.</hi> a Cough, Fire, and Love, to which you may well add grace, of which ſhews are not only allowed but commanded, <hi>Matth. 5. 16. Let your light ſo ſhine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Phil. 2. 16. holding forth the word of life,</hi> as the Admiral-ſhip holds out its Lanthorn behind, that the reſt of the Fleet in a foggy day or dark night, may ſteer their courſe accordingly, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 9. that ye ſhould</hi> ſhew <hi>forth the praiſes</hi> (or vertues) <hi>of him.</hi> But to be a ſhell without a kernel (as they ſay of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifax-nuts)</hi> that is naught.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I deny not but there may be ſome Reality even in Formality, as to the third ground, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 20. there was a real cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the Spirit of God, though by an inferior and common operation; and a real effect, joy, though it was but temporary; and a real
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63963:11"/>
ſubject, an hearer, a rational creature. Indeed a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of a man hath no life, though it ſeem to ſee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but compariſons run not (as they ſay) on four feet. Real (I ſay) in oppoſition to imaginary, not to hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical.</p>
               <p>I confeſs it is very hard to diſtinguiſh between the form and power of godlineſs. The Tares mentioned <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. were ſo like the Wheat in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, that it was no eaſie matter to diſtinguiſh them; therefore Chriſt would not have them pulled up; True Balſom cannot (at leaſt for a while) be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from counterfeit, <hi>Iſ. 1. 25. and take away thy Tin.</hi> Tin (we know) is ſo like to Silver, that ſome are deceived therewith; ſo is the form like to the power. There is a likneſs between a <hi>Briſtol</hi> and an <hi>Indian</hi> Diamond, yet a skilful Jeweller can diſtinguiſh; if I fall ſhort, impute it to want of skill, not of will.</p>
               <p>The Characters now are branched into Negative and Affirmative. 1. Negative, which are five in Number. He hath but a form of godlineſs, where there is</p>
               <p n="1">1. No <hi>Senſe</hi> of the burden of ſin, or of Gods wrath, or the woful condition of man by nature. If he never felt any trouble of mind, any affliction of ſpirit for a ſtate of unregeneracy, or for ſome ſpecial corruption, he hath but a form; I know that <hi>Matthew</hi> without any trouble of ſpirit (that we read of) was called from the receit of Cuſtom; and God opened the heart of <hi>Lydia</hi> without ſenſible pangs; and <hi>Timothy</hi> (it's thought) ſuckt in grace together with his mothers milk; but this is not Gods ordinary way. The Lord himſelf humbled <hi>Adam,</hi> Gen. 3. before he preached the Goſpel, the promiſed ſeed to him. <hi>Peters</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63963:12"/>

Therefore the Spirit is called <hi>the Spirit of bondage,</hi> Rom, 8. 15. becauſe it is the work of the Spirit to convince a ſinner of his bondage to ſin, Satan, and Gods wrath, before he becomes a Spirit of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. No <hi>Serving</hi> the Lord in private and ſecret. Good <hi>Joſhua</hi>

To prove <hi>Job</hi> an Hypocrite, it was charged (though falſely) on him, that he did reſtrain Prayer before God. A true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian hath ſecret ſins to bewail, and ſecret mercies to beg, and there Chriſt is held (by the Soul) in the Galleries <note n="b" place="margin">Cant. 7. 5.</note>. What is Prayer but a friendly confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, a familiar talk with God? Now thou canſt pray (thou ſaiſt) in the Church, but no Prayer at all in thy houſe, in thy cloſet. When did Jeſus Chriſt ſee thee upon thy knees in ſecret? Thou art a meer ſtranger to God, and com'ſt not at him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. No <hi>Seeking</hi> the Lord for himſelf, but for a mans own ſelf. <hi>Iſal. 9. 13. neither do they ſeek the Lord of Hoſts, with</hi> Hoſ. 7. 10. <hi>nor ſeek him (the Lord) for all this.</hi> I dout not but they prayed, and ſought the Lord (that plough was not to ſtand ſtill) but it was for themſelves. <hi>Zach. 7. 5, 6.

               <p>Thus of the Negative Signs; I come now to the Affirmative; but I muſt take notice of one Character that is obnoxious to juſt Queſtion. It hath been preached within a mile of an Oak, that, <hi>They who are againſt forms of Prayer, have but a form of godlineſs:</hi> An uncharitable, unſcriptural, unſavoury expreſſion, a very falſe mark.

1. Lament and bewail with tears of blood, that ſo many living in the boſom of the Church have but a Form of Religion, as, thoſe that do deny Original Sin, who yet, with <hi>Nepthali</hi> give goodly words, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. 21. and by good words and fair ſpeeches deceive the hearts of the ſimple, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 18. I would be loth to be uncharitable, but I aſſure you, I have not ſo much charity to think, that they who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Original Sin, have ſuch experience of their naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hearts, and ſuch acquaintance with the Scriptures that they talk of. They are ſtrangers to the power of godlineſs, that are ſtrangers to the power of Original corruption. 2. Civil honeſt men, that are deadly Enemies to the power of Religion, whoſe character you may find in <hi>Prov. 30. 13. There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet not waſhed from their filthineſs,</hi> from excrementitial filth, <note n="u" place="margin">T. C.</note> as the word ſignifies. 3. That upſtart Generation of late <hi>Quakers,</hi> who have the knack of railing and reviling Gods Miniſters and people; See <hi>Jam. 1. 26. If any man among you ſeeem to be religious and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this mans Religion is in vain.</hi> 4. Profane men, who carry the black brand of ſin and Hell in their face and forehead, who profeſs themſelves to be Chriſtians (and take it in ſnuf if they be reputed otherwiſe) when they live like Pagans: <note n="w" place="margin">Qui profitentur ſe Chriſtiaons cum ſint nequiſſimi, opere et ſenſu perverſi. <hi>Ambr.</hi> in loc.</note> Some think my Text to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of theſe. 5. Formal Profeſſors, that pray in the Church for holineſs and purity of living, yet prate againſt piety and purity, and live in all unholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and impurity. As he ſaith in another caſe, <hi>Joel 3. 14. Multitudes, multitudes, in the valley of Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;</hi> So multitudes, multitudes, (of them that have
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63963:21"/>
but a Form of Devotion) in the valley of viſion, in the Church and Land, where preaching hath been vouchſafed ſo long; This is a Lamentation, and and ſhall be for a Lamentation, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 19. 14.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Beware of them who have but a Form of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, confide not in them. The cloſe of the verſe in my Text is, <hi>from ſuch turn awy.</hi> The old <note n="x" place="margin">Devita.</note> 
                  <hi>Latin</hi> hath it, ſhun them—converſe not with them, in a needleſs and familiar manner, or thus, be averſe to them; for a Biſhop (and ſo every Chriſtian) muſt not only <note n="y" place="margin">Non ſatie eſt vitare ſed eos averſari, imo iis adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſari. <hi>A Lap.</hi>
                  </note> ſhun ſuch, but ſet themſelves againſt ſuch. By this it is evident, that <hi>Paul</hi> doth not only ſpeak of future time, but ſhews, that <note n="z" place="margin">Eſti.</note> in that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Age ſuch kind of Formaliſts (whom he doth here decipher) ſhould not be, nay, were not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſtore enough. <hi>Phil. 3. 2. Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the Conciſion.</hi> It's ſaid three times beware, as if we could not be too wary; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Lawyers Maxim, <note n="a" place="margin">Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dans cautel a non nocet.</note> Abundance of Caution doth no harm at all. Beware therefore of Dogs, that though they have a form of Religion, yet are covetous, <hi>v.</hi> 2. with <hi>Iſ. 56. 10.—greedy Dogs,</hi> that can never have enough. Beware of evil workers, that (Judaizing) ſeem to be zealous for the Law, when their lives are bad, or <note n="a" place="margin">Gro.</note> are not converſant <hi>bona ſide</hi> in the Goſpel, the work of the Lord, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of the Conciſion,</hi> who urging the Ceremonial Law, conſtraining others to be circumciſed, <hi>Gal. 6. 12. to cut off the fore-skin of the fleſh,</hi> when themſelves were cutters and renters of the Churches of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And the rather are we to be cautious of ſuch;</p>
               <p>Becauſe 1. Of the <hi>Reſemblance</hi> between the Form
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:63963:22"/>
and the Power of Religion, and therefore more apt to be deceived. <hi>Matth. 7. 15. Beware of falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets which come to you in ſheeps clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Simiae imitantur ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines ſicut lupi canes, quibus ſimiles ſunt. <hi>Cyp.</hi> ad <hi>Job.</hi>
                  </note> Apes are ſomewhat like Men, and Wolves like Dogs, Silly Souls are much taken with ſuch ſhews, as children with gauds and gugaws. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 23. Which—have a ſhew of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in will-worſhip and humility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Becauſe of the <hi>Rottenneſs</hi> of ſuch, who not only fail us, when we have moſt need, like water-brooks in Summer, <hi>Job</hi> 6. 15. but hurt us the more. <hi>Prov. 25. 19. Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is like a broken tooth and a foot out of joynt.</hi> A bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken tooth doth but pain a hungry man, chewing a piece of bread or meat; a diſlocated leg hinders a man from flying in time of danger, and if he make an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay, he is more tormented. They that have been ſeemingly our greateſt friends, have really proved our greateſt foes. None are ſorer perſecutours, then Formal Profeſſors; our Stories tell us, the husband hath carried a fagot to burn therewith his wife. Therefore liſten to that grave ſerious and ſeaſonable counſel, <hi>Mic. 7. 5. Truſt ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide, keep the door of thy mouth from her that lyeth in thy boſom. For the ſon diſhonoureth the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the daughter riſeth up againſt her mother.—a mans enemies are the men of his own houſe.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, This may comfort true <hi>Nathanaels</hi> in whoſe ſpirit there is no predominant guile, who (through free grace,) have the Form and Power of Godlineſs too, in ſome meaſure. I would not have my Sun ſet in a cloud. Let this Cordial be boxed up againſt the time of trouble and reproaches of ungodly men. Whatſoever venom graceleſs men ſpit in their faces, yet they may rejoyce in this, that they are not in this black Bill, but their names are written in Heaven, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 20.</p>
