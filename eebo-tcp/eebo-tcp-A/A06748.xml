            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Towne of Maydſtone, who being vnmaryed, played the naughty packe, and was gotten with
childe, being deliuered of the ſame childe the .xxiiij. daye of October laſt paſt, in the yeare of our
Lord. 1568. at .vij. of the clocke in the after noone of the ſame day being Sonday. Which child
being a man child, had firſt the mouth ſlitted on the right ſide like a Libardes mouth, terrible to beholde,
the left arme lying vpon the breſt, faſt therto ioyned, hauing as it were ſtumps on the handes, the left leg
growing vpward toward the head, and the ryght leg bending toward the left leg, the foote therof grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the buttocke of the ſayd left leg. In the middeſt of the backe there was a broade lump of fleſh in
faſhion lyke a Roſe, in the myddeſt whereof was a hole, which voyded like an Iſſue. Thys ſayd Childe
was borne alyue, and lyued .xxiiij. houres, and then departed this lyfe. Which may be a terrour aſwell to
all ſuch workers of filthynes &amp; iniquity, as to thoſe vngodly liuers. Who (if in them any feare of God be)
may mooue them to repentance and amendement of lyfe, which God for Chriſtes ſake graunt both to
them and vs. Amen. Witneſſes hereof were theſe, William Plomer, Iohn Squier Glaſier, Iohn
Sadler Goldſmith, beſides diuers other credible perſons both men and women.</p>
