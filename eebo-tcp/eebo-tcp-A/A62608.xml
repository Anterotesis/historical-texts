            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE design of this <hi>Psalm</hi> is to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
the goodness and justice of the
Divine Providence, notwithstanding
the prosperous estate of the wicked
and the afflicted condition of good
men many times in this World. And
in the first place, the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> whoever he was, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>David</hi> or <hi>Asaph,</hi> lays down this for a most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Truth, that God is good to good men: <hi>Of a
truth God is good to</hi> Israel,<note place="margin">V. 1.</note> 
               <hi>to such as are of a clean heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet for all this he tells us, that at some times
he was under no small temptation to question the
truth of this <hi>Principle,</hi> when he beheld the promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
dispensation of things here below; that the
wicked are often prosperous, and good men expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to great calamities in this life; as if God either
neglected human affairs, or had a greater kindness
for the workers of iniquity than for pious and good
men: <hi>As for me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. 2.</note> 
               <hi>my foot had well nigh slipp'd, for I was
envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, he says, was a very great stumbling block
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98144:4"/>
to good men, and tempted them to doubt of the
Providence of God:<note place="margin">V. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Therefore his People return hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them; and
they say, doth God know, and is there knowledge in the most
High?</hi> This Sentence is somewhat obscurely ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
in our <hi>Translation,</hi> so as to make the sense of it
difficult, which is plainly this, <hi>Therefore his people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
hither,</hi> that is, therefore good men come to this,
in the greatness of their affliction, and in the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their soul, to question God's knowledg and
care of human affairs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold,</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. 12.</note> say they, <hi>these are the ungodly, and yet they
are the prosperous in the world, they increase in riches:</hi> To
what purpose then is it for any man to be Religious
and vertuous? <hi>Verily, I have cleansed my heart in vain,
and washed my hands in innocency:</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. 13.</note> In vain have I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
after purity of heart and innocency of
life, since so little good comes of it; nay, so far
from that, that I have been in continual trouble and
affliction: <hi>All the day long have I been plagued, and chast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
every morning.</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. 14.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Such thoughts as these often came into his mind,
and gave him great trouble and disquiet: But he
presently corrects himself: <hi>If I say I will speak thus,
I should offend against the generation of thy Children,</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. 15.</note> that
is, I should go against the sense of all pious and
good men, who have always believed the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98144:4"/>
of God notwithstanding this Objection:
Which at last he tells us he had raised on purpose to
try if he could find the solution of it: <hi>I thought to
know this, which was grievous in mine eyes:</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. 16.</note> And then
he resolves all into the unsearchable wisdom of the
Divine Providence, which if we fully understood
from first to last, we should see good reason to be
satisfied with the equity of it:<note place="margin">V. 17, 18.</note> 
               <hi>When I go into the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary
of God, then shall I understand the end of these
men? How thou didst set them in slippery places,</hi> &amp;c. This
satisfied him, that whenever the secret design of God's
Providence should be unfolded whether in this World
or the other, how strange and cross soever things
might seem to be at present, yet in the issue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
it would appear, that neither are bad men so
happy, nor good men so miserable, as at present they
may seem to be.</p>
            <p>So that upon a full debate of this matter the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist</hi>
concludes, that these Objections against Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
do spring from our ignorance, and short and
imperfect view of things; whereas if we saw the
whole design from beginning to end, it would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be very reasonable and regular. <hi>Thus my
heart was grieved;</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. 21.</note> 
               <hi>so foolish was I and ignorant, and as a
beast before thee.</hi> And in regard to himself he tells
us, that he saw great reason to acknowledge God's
tender care over him in particular, and that he could
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98144:5"/>
find no security or comfort for himself, but in God
alone:<note place="margin">V. 23.</note> 
               <hi>Nevertheless I am continually with thee; thou hast
holden me by thy right hand: Thou shalt guide me with thy
counsel, and afterwards receive me to glory;</hi> as if he had said,
I am sensible of thy constant presence with me, and
care of me; and do entirely depend upon thy gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
and direction, not doubting but that my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
troubles and afflictions will have a happy and
glorious issue.</p>
            <p>And at last he breaks out into a kind of exultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and triumph for the mighty consolation which
he found in the firm belief of the <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
of God, as the great stay and support of his
soul in the worst condition that could befall him;
in the words of the <hi>Text, Whom have I in heaven but
thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee.</hi>
If a man were to chuse a happiness for himself, and
were to ransack Heaven and Earth for it, after all
his search and enquiry he would at last fix upon God
as the chief happiness of man, and the true and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rest and center of our souls. This then is the plain
meaning of the <hi>Text, That nothing in the world but God
can make man happy: Whom have I in heaven but thee?
and there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That man of himself is not sufficient for his own
happiness is evident upon many accounts: Because
he is liable to so many evils and calamities, which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98144:5"/>
he can neither prevent, nor remedy: He is full of
wants which he cannot supply; compassed about
with infirmities which he can only complain of, but
is not able to redress: He is obnoxious to dangers
which he must always fear, because he can never suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
provide against them.</p>
            <p>Consider man by himself, and from under the
conduct and protection of a superior and more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
Being, and he is in a most disconsolate and
forlorn condition: Secure of nothing that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys,
and liable to be disappointed of every thing that
he hopes for: He is apt to grieve for what he cannot
help, and perhaps the justest cause of his grief is that
he cannot help it; for if he could, instead of grieving
for it he would help it: He cannot refrain from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
a great many things which he would fain have,
but is never likely to obtain, because they are out
of his power; and it troubles him both that they are
so, and that he cannot help his being troubled at it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus man walketh in a vain shew, and disquieteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in vain;</hi> courting happiness in a thousand shapes,
and the faster he follows it the swifter it flyes from
him. Almost every thing promiseth happiness to us
at a distance, such a step of Honour, such a pitch of
Estate, such a Fortune or Match for a Child: But
when we come nearer to it, either we fall short of
it, or it falls short of our expectation; and it is hard
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98144:6"/>
to say which of these is the greatest disappointment.
Our hopes are usually bigger than enjoyment can
satisfie, and an evil long fear'd, besides that it may
never come, is many times more painful and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
than the evil it self when it comes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In a word, man is born to trouble as the sparks fly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</hi>
He comes into the world naked and unarm'd,
and from himself more destitute of the natural means
of his security and support than any other Creature
whatsoever, as it were on purpose to shew that he
is more peculiarly the care of a Superior Providence:
And as man, of all the Creatures of this lower world,
is only made to own and acknowledg a Deity; so
God in great wisdom hath so order'd things, that
none of the other Creatures should have so much
need of Him, and so much reason to acknowledg
their necessary dependance upon him. So that the
words of <hi>David</hi> are the very sense and voice of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
declaring to us that Mankind is born into the
World upon terms of greater dependance upon the
Providence of God than other Creatures: <hi>Thou art he,</hi>
says <hi>David</hi> there to God, <hi>that tookest me out of the womb,
thou madest me to hope,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 22. 9, 10, 11.</note> or thou didst keep me in safety,
<hi>when I was upon my mother's breasts: I was cast upon thee
from the womb, thou art my God from my mother's belly: Be not
far from me, for trouble is near:</hi> Trouble is always near
to us, and therefore it is happy for us that God is never
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98144:6"/>
far from any of us: <hi>For in Him we live, and move, and
have our being.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when we are grown up, we are liable to a
great many mischiefs and dangers, every moment of
our lives; and, without the Providence of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
insecure, not only of the good things of this
life, but even of life it self: So that when we come to
be men, we cannot but wonder how ever we arriv'd
at that state, and how we have continued in it so long,
considering the infinite difficulties and dangers which
have continually attended us: That in running the
<hi>gantlope</hi> of a long life, when so many hands have been
lifted up against us, and so many strokes levell'd at
us, we have escaped so free, and with so few marks
and scars upon us: That when we are besieged with
so many dangers, and so many arrows of death are
perpetually flying about us, to which we do so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ways lie open, we should yet hold out <hi>twenty, forty,
sixty</hi> years, and some of us perhaps longer, and do still
stand at the mark untouch'd, at least not dangerously
wounded by any of them: And considering likewise
this fearful and wonderful frame of a human Body,
this infinitely complicated Engine; in which, to the
due performance of the several functions and offices
of life, so many strings and springs, so many recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
and channels are necessary, and all in their right
frame and order; and in which, besides the infinite
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98144:7"/>
imperceptible and secret ways of mortality, there
are so many sluces and flood-gates to let Death in
and Life out, that it is next to a miracle, tho we take
but little notice of it, that every one of us did not dye
every day since we were born: I say, considering the
nice and curious frame of our Bodies, and the innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
contingencies and hazards of human Life, which
is set in so slippery a place, that we still continue in
the land of the living we cannot ascribe to any thing
but the watchful Providence of Almighty God, <hi>who
holds our soul in life, and suffers not our foot to be moved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the same merciful Providence of God we owe,
that whilst we continue in life we have any comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
possession and enjoyment of our selves and of
that which makes us men, I mean our Reason and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding:
That our Imagination is not let loose
upon us, to haunt and torment us with melancholick
freaks and fears: That we are not deliver'd up to the
horrors of a gloomy and guilty mind: That every
day we do not fall into frenzy and distraction, which
next to wickedness and vice is the sorest calamity,
and saddest disguise of human nature: I say, next to
wickedness and vice, which is a wilful frenzy, a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
not from misfortune but from choice; whereas
the <hi>other</hi> proceeds from natural and necessary causes,
such as are in a great measure out of our power; so
that we are perpetually liable to it, from any secret
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98144:7"/>
and sudden disorder of the Brain, from the violence
of a Disease, or the vehement transport of any Passion.</p>
            <p>Now if things were under no government, what
could hinder so many probable evils from breaking
in upon us, and from treading upon the heels of one
another? like the Calamities of <hi>Job,</hi> when <hi>the hedge
which God had set about him and all that he had was broken
down and removed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that if there were no God to take care of us, we
could be secure of no sort, no degree of happiness in
this World; no not for one moment: And there
would be no other World for us to be happy in, and
to make amends to us for all the fears and dangers,
all the troubles and calamities of this present life: For
God and another World stand and fall together:
Without <hi>Him</hi> there can be no Life after this; and
if our hopes of happiness were only in this Life,
Man of all other Beings in this lower World would
certainly be the most miserable.</p>
            <p>I cannot say that all the Evils which I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
would happen to all, if the Providence of
God did not rule the World; but that every man
would be in danger of them all, and have nothing
to support and comfort him against the fear of that
danger. For the nature of man, consider'd by it self,
is plainly insufficient for its own happiness; so that
we must necessarily look abroad, and seek for it
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98144:8"/>
somewhere else: And who can shew us that good
that is equal to all the wants and necessities, all the
capacities and desires, all the fears and hopes of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
nature? Whatsoever can answer all these must
have these following Properties,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> It must be an all-sufficient good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It must be perfect goodness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It must be firm and unchangeable in it
self.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It must be such a good as none can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
us of, and take away from us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It must be eternal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> It must be able to support and comfort us
in every condition, and under all the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
and adversities of human Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> It must be such a good as can give perfect
rest and tranquillity to our minds.</p>
            <p>Nothing that is short of all this can make us hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py:
And no Creature, no not the whole Creation,
can pretend to be all this to us. All these Properties
meet only in God, who is the perfect and supream
Good; as I shall endeavour, in the following Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
more particularly to shew; and consequently,
<hi>That God is the only happiness of Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> God is an all-sufficient Good. And this does
import <hi>two</hi> things; Wisdom to contrive our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98144:8"/>
and Power to effect it; for neither of these
without the other is sufficient, and both these in the
highest and most eminent degree are in God.</p>
            <p>He is infinitely <hi>Wise</hi> to design and contrive our
happiness; because he knows what Happiness is, and
how to frame us so as to be capable of the happiness
he designs for us; and how to order and dispose all
other things so, as that they shall be no hindrance
and impediment to it.</p>
            <p>He perfectly understands all the possibilities of
things, and how to fit means to any end. He knows
all our wants, and how to supply them; all our
hopes and desires, and how to satisfy them: He
foresees all the dangers and evils which threaten
us, and knows how to prevent or divert them, if
he think fit; or if he permit them to come, how to
support us under them, or to deliver us out of them,
or to turn them to our greater benefit and advantage
in the last issue and result of things.</p>
            <p>His Wisdom cannot be surprised by any accident
which he did not foresee, and which he is not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
provided against. The wisdom of men is but
short and imperfect, and liable to infinite errours and
mistakes: In many cases men know not what is safest
and best for them, nor whether <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
most to their happiness: Nay it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
that those very means which the wisest men
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98144:9"/>
chuse for their security do prove the occasions of their
ruine, and they are thrown down by those very ways
whereby they thought to raise and to establish them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>Especially if God breath upon the Counsels of
men, how are their designs blasted? How are they
infatuated and foil'd in their deepest contrivances,
and <hi>snared in the work of their own hands?</hi> When <hi>it is of
the Lord,</hi> the wisdom of the greatest <hi>Politicians</hi> is
turned into foolishness: For <hi>there is no wisdom, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
nor counsel against the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Divine wisdom, being founded upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
knowledge, is thereby secur'd against all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
of errour and mistake. God perfectly
knows the natures and the powers of all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and therefore can never be mistaken in the
use and application of them to any of his purposes:
So that none of his designs of love and mercy to
the Sons of men can miscarry for want of good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance,
or wise conduct.</p>
            <p>And as he is perfectly <hi>wise</hi> to contrive our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
so is he infinitely <hi>powerful</hi> to effect it, and to
remove out of the way all the obstacles and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of it. We may understand many times what
would conduce to our happiness, but may not be
able to compass it; but nothing is out of the reach
of Omnipotency: Many things are difficult to us,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98144:9"/>
but nothing is too hard for God: Many things are
impossible with us, but <hi>with God all things are possible.</hi>
For He is the fountain and original of all power, from
whom it is deriv'd and upon whom it depends, and
to whom it is perfectly subject and subordinate: He
can do all things at once, and in an instant, and with
the greatest ease; and no created power can put any
difficulty in his way, much less make any effectual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance;
because Omnipotency can check, and
countermand, and bear down before it all other
Powers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So that if God be on our side, who can be against
us? We may safely</hi> commit our Souls into his hands, for
he is able to keep that which is committed to him. <hi>He can
give us all good things, and deliver us from all evil,
for</hi> his is the Kingdom and the glorious Power. <hi>Though
all Creatures should fail us, we may rely upon God,
and live upon his All-sufficiency for our supply; and
may say with the</hi> Prophet, Though the Figtree should not
blossom, neither Fruit be in the Vine; though the labour of
the Olive should fail, and the Fields should yield no meat;
though the Flock should be cut off from the Fold, and there
should be no Herd in the Stalls; yet would I rejoice in the
Lord, and joy in the God of my Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As God is an All-sufficient Good, so He <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
is perfect Goodness. He is willing to communicate
happiness to us, and to employ his Power and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98144:10"/>
for our good. He made us that he might
make us happy, and nothing can hinder us from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so but our selves. Such is his goodness, that <hi>he
would have all men to be saved, and to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the truth:</hi> And when we have provoked him
by our sins, <hi>he is long suffering to usward, not willing
that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance:</hi>
For <hi>he delighteth not in the death of a sinner, but rather
that he should turn from his wickedness and live.</hi> So that
if any of us be miserable, it is our own choice; if we
perish, our destruction is of our selves: For as the
<hi>Wiseman,</hi> in one of the <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Books, says excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently,
<hi>God made not death, neither hath he pleasure in the
destruction of the living: But men seek death in the errour
of their life, and pull destruction upon themselves, with
the works of their own hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So great is the goodness of God to mankind, that
he hath omitted nothing that is necessary to our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.
He design'd it for us at first, and to that
end he hath endued us with powers and faculties
whereby we are capable of knowing, and loving,
and obeying, and enjoying <hi>Him</hi> the chief Good.
And when we had forfeited all this by the wilful
transgression and disobedience of the first Parents of
mankind, and were miserably bruised and maimed
by their fall, God of his infinite mercy was pleas'd
to restore us to a new capacity of happiness, by send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98144:10"/>
his only Son to suffer in our nature, and in our
stead; and thereby to become <hi>a Propitiation for the sins
of the whole World,</hi> and <hi>the Author of eternal Salvation to
them that believe and obey him:</hi> And he hath likewise
promised to give us his Holy Spirit, to enable us to that
Faith and Obedience which the Gospel requires of us,
as the necessary conditions of our eternal Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> God is also a firm and unchangeable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
Good. Notwithstanding his infinite Wisdom, and
Power, and Goodness, we might be miserable if God
were mutable. For that cannot be a happiness which
depends upon uncertainties, and perhaps one of the
greatest aggravations of misery is to fall from hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
to have been once happy and afterwards to
cease to be so: And that would unavoidably happen
to us, if the cause of our happiness could change<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
the foundation of it be removed. If God could be
otherwise than powerful, and wise, and good, all
our hopes of happiness would be shaken, and would
fall to the ground. But the Divine nature is not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to any change: As he is <hi>the Father of lights,</hi> and
<hi>the Author of every good and perfect gift,</hi> so <hi>with him is no
variableness, neither shadow of turning.</hi> All the things
of this World are mutable, and for that reason, had
they no other imperfection belonging to them, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make us happy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> God is such a good as none can deprive <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:98144:11"/>
us of and take away from us. If the things of this
World were unchangeable in their nature, and not
liable to any decay, yet they cannot make us happy;
because we may be cheated of them by fraud, or
robb'd of them by violence: But God cannot be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from us. Nothing but our Sins can part God and
us:<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 35.</note> 
               <hi>Who shall separate us,</hi> saith the <hi>Apostle, from the
love of God? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution,
or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</hi> We may be
stripp'd of all our worldly comforts and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
by the violence of men; but none of all
these can separate us from God:<note place="margin">v. 38, 39.</note> 
               <hi>I am persuaded,</hi> as
the <hi>Apostle</hi> goes on <hi>with great triumph, that neither death
nor life; nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers; nor
heighth, nor depth, nor things present, nor things to come,
nor any other Creature, shall be able to separate us from
the love of God which is in Christ</hi> Jesus, <hi>our Lord. Nor
any other Creature:</hi> Here is a sufficient induction of
particulars, and nothing left out of this Catalogue
but one, and <hi>that</hi> is <hi>Sin,</hi> which is none of God's <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
but our own: <hi>This</hi> indeed deliberately consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to, and wilfully continued in, will finally part
God and us, and for ever hinder us from being happy.</p>
            <p>But if we be careful to avoid this, which only
can separate between God and us, nothing can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
us of Him: The aids and influences of
his Grace none can intercept and hinder: the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98144:11"/>
joyes and comforts of his Holy Spirit none can
take from us: All other things may leave us and
forsake us: We may be debarr'd of our best
friends, and banish'd from all our acquaintance;
but men can send us no whither from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God: Our Communication with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
cannot be prevented or interrupted: Our
Prayers and our Souls will always find the way
thither from the uttermost parts of the Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> God is an Eternal God: And nothing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/>
but what is so can make us happy. Man having
an immortal Spirit, and being design'd for an
endless duration, must have a happiness propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable:
For which reason nothing in this
World can make us happy, because we shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
and remain after it: When a very few years
are past and gone, and much sooner for any thing
we know, all the things of this World will leave
us, or else we shall be taken away from them,
<hi>But God is from everlasting to everlasting: He is the
same, and his years faile not:</hi> Therefore well
might <hi>David</hi> fix his happiness upon God alone,
and say, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and
there is none upon Earth that I desire besides thee:
When my heart faileth, and my strength faileth,
God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for
ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:98144:12"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> God is able to support and comfort
us, in every condition, and under all the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
and adversities of human Life. Outward
afflictions may hurt our Body, but they cannot
reach our Soule; and so long as <hi>that</hi> remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wounded
<hi>the spirit of a man can bear his infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>
God is intimate to our Soules, and hath se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
wayes whereby to convey the joyes and
comforts of his Holy Spirit into our hearts, under
the bitterest afflictions and sharpest sufferings:
He can enable us by his Grace <hi>to possess our soules
in patience,</hi> when all other things are taken from
us: When there is nothing but trouble about us,
He can <hi>give us peace and joy in believing:</hi> When
we are <hi>persecuted, afflicted,</hi> and <hi>tormented,</hi> He
can give us that ravishing sight of the Glories of
another World, that stedfast assurance of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Blessedness, as shall quite extinguish all sense
of present sufferings: How did many of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
<hi>Christian Martyrs,</hi> in the midst of their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and under the very pangs of death <hi>rejoyce
in the hope of the glory of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are none of us but may happen to fall
into those circumstances of danger, and of bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
paines and sufferings, as to have no hopes of
relief and comfort but from God; none in all
the World to trust to but <hi>Him</hi> only: And in the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98144:12"/>
greatest Evils that can befall us in this life, He
is a sure refuge and sanctuary; and to repeat the
words of the <hi>Psalmist</hi> after the <hi>Text, When our
heart failes, and our strength failes, God is the
strength of our hearts, and our portion for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now what would any of us do in such a Case,
if it were not for God? Human nature is liable
to desperate straits and exigencies: And he is not
happy who is not provided against the worst that
may happen. It is sad to be reduced to such a
condition, as to be destitute of all comfort and
hope: And yet men may be brought to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity,
that if it were not for God they would
not know which way to turn themselves, or how
to entertain their thoughts with any comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
considerations under their present anguish.</p>
            <p>All men naturally resort to God in extremity;
and cry out to him for help: Even the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
and Atheistical, when they are destitute of
all other comfort, will run to God, and take hold
of him, and cling about him. But <hi>God hath no
pleasure in fooles;</hi> in those who neglect and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pise
him in their prosperity, though they owe
that also entirely to him; but when the evil day
comes, then they lay hold of him as their only
refuge: When all things go well with them,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98144:13"/>
               <hi>God is not in all their thoughts;</hi> but <hi>in their affliction
they will seek him early: Then they will cry Lord,
Lord;</hi> but <hi>he will say to them in that day, depart
from me ye workers of iniquity, for I know you not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here will be the great unhappiness of such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
that God will then appear terrible to them,
so as they shall not be able, when they look up
to him, to abide his frowns: And at the same
time that they are forc'd to acknowledge him, and
to supplicate to him for mercy and forgiveness,
they shall be ready to despair of it:</hi> Then, <hi>those
terrible threatnings of Gods Word will come to
their minds,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 1. 24. 25. &amp;c.</note> Because I called, and yet
refused; I
stretched out my hand, and no man regarded: But
<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> set at nought all my counsel, and would have none
of my reproof; I also will laugh at your calamity,
and monk when your fear cometh; when your fear
cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as
a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh
upon you: Then shall they call upon me; but I will
not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall
not find me: For that they hated knowledge, and
did not chuse the fear of the Lord: They would
none of my counsel, they despised all my reproofe:
Therefore shall they eat the fruit of their own ways,
and be filled with their own devices: The ease of
the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fooles
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98144:13"/>
shall destroy them. <hi>To which I will add that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Passage in the</hi> Prophet, <hi>concerning the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
and obstinate</hi> Jews, They are a People of no
understanding,<note place="margin">Isa. 27. 11.</note> therefore he that made them will not
have mercy on them, and he that formed them will
shew them no favour. <hi>And men are miserable
Creatures indeed, when God their</hi> Maker <hi>doth
abandon them, and hath so far hardened his heart
against them, that he can have no pity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly</hi> and lastly, which is consequent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/>
all the rest, God is such a Good as can give
perfect rest and tranquillity to our minds. And
that which cannot do this, though it had all the
Properties before mentioned, cannot make us
happy. For he is not happy who does not think
himself so, whatever cause he may have to think
so. Now what in reason can give us disquiet, if
we do firmly believe that there is a God, and
that his Providence rules and governs all things
for the best; and that God is all that to good
Men which hath now been said of Him? Why
should not our minds be in perfect repose, when
we are secure of the chief Good, and have found
out that which can make us happy, and is willing
to make us so, if we be not wanting to our selves,
and by our wilful obstinacy and rebellion against
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98144:14"/>
him do not oppose and frustrate this design?</p>
            <p>If a considerate Man were permitted to his
own choice, to wish the greatest good to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
that he could possibly devise; after he had
searched Heaven and Earth, the result of all his
wishes would be that there were just such a
Being as we must necessarily conceive God to be:
Nor would he chuse any other Friend or Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour;
any other Protectour for himself or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
for the whole World, than infinite Power
conducted and managed by infinite Wisdom and
Goodness; which is the true Notion of a God:
After all his enquiry he would come to the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist</hi>'s
conclusion here in the Text, <hi>Whom have I
in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth
that I desire besides thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vain Man is apt to seek for happiness else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
but this proceeds from want of due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration:
For when all things are well weigh'd,
and all accounts rightly cast up and adjusted, we
shall at last settle in <hi>David</hi>'s resolution of that
great <hi>Question, What is the chief Good of man?
There be many,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ps. 4. 6, 7, 8.</note> says he, <hi>that say, Who will shew
us any good?</hi> that is, men are generally inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
after happiness, but greatly divided in their
Opinions about it: most men place it in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
enjoyments of this World, but <hi>David</hi> for
his part pitches upon God, in whom he was fully
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98144:14"/>
convinc'd that the happiness of man does consist:
<hi>There be many that say, who will shew us any good?
Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon
us: Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than
in the time that their Corn and Wine increased.</hi> The
great joy of the men of this World is in a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Harvest, and the abundance of the good
things of this life: But <hi>David</hi> had found that
which gave more joy and gladness to his heart,
the favour of God and the <hi>light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance:</hi>
This gave perfect rest and tranquillity to
his mind, so that he needed not to enquire any
further: For so it follows in the next words, <hi>I
will both lay me down in peace, and rest, for thou,
Lord, onely makest me to dwell in safety:</hi> The <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>
word signifies <hi>confidence</hi> or <hi>security:</hi> Here,
and no where else, his mind found rest, and was
in perfect ease and security.</p>
            <p>I shall now only make two or three <hi>Inferences</hi>
from this Discourse, and so conclude.</p>
            <p>First, This plainly shews us the great unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
and folly of <hi>Atheism,</hi> which would
banish the belief of God and his Providence out of
the World: Which as it is most impious in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of God, so is it most malicious to Men;
because it strikes at the very foundation of our
happiness, and perfectly undermines it. For if
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98144:15"/>
there were no God, man would evidently be the
most unhappy of all other Beings here below;
because his unhappiness would be laid in the very
frame of his nature, in that which distinguishes
him from all other Beings below him, I mean in
his Reason and Understanding: And he would
be so much more miserable than the Beasts, by
how much he hath a farther reach, and a larger
prospect of future evils; a quicker apprehension,
and a deeper and more lasting resentment of
them.</p>
            <p>So that if any man could see reason to stagger
his belief of a God, or of his Providence, as I
am sure there is infinite reason to the contrary;
yet the belief of these things is so much for the
interest, and comfort, and happiness of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
that a wise man would be heartily troubled
to part with a Principle so favourable to his quiet,
and that does so exactly answer all the natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
and hopes and fears of men, and is so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
calculated both for our comfort in this
World, and for our happiness in the other. For
when a man's thoughts have ranged and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as far as they can, his mind can find no
rest, no probable foundation of happiness but
God onely; no other reasonable, no nor tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<hi>Hypothesis</hi> and <hi>Scheme</hi> of things for a wise
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98144:15"/>
man to rely upon, and to live and die by. For
no other Principle but this, firmely believed, and
truly lived up to by an answerable practise, was
ever able to support the generality of Mankind,
and to minister true consolation to them under
the calamities of life, and the pangs of death.</p>
            <p>And if there were not something real in the
Principles of Religion, it is impossible that they
should have so remarkeable and so regular an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
to support our minds in every condition, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so great a number of persons of different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of understanding, of all ranks and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
young and old, learned and unlearned,
in so many distant Places, and in all Ages of the
World the Records whereof are come down to
us: I say so real, and so frequent, and so regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
an effect as this is, cannot with any colour of
reason be ascribed either to blind Chance, or
meer Imagination, but must have a real, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
and uniform cause proportionable to so
great and general an effect.</p>
            <p>I remember that <hi>Grotius,</hi> in his excellent
<hi>Book of the Truth of the Christian Religion,</hi> hath
this observation, That God did not intend that
the Principles of Religion should have the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
evidence that any thing is capable of, and
such as is sufficient to answer and bear down all
sorts of captious Cavils and Objections against it;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98144:16"/>
but so much as is abundantly sufficient to satisfie
a sober and impartial Enquirer after Truth, one
that hath no other interest but to find out Truth,
and when he hath found it to yield to it: If it
were otherwise, and the Principles of Religion
were as glaring and evident as the Sun shining at
Noon-day, as there could hardly be any vertue in
such a Faith, so Infidelity would be next to an
impossibility.</p>
            <p>All that I would expect from any man, that
shall say that he cannot see sufficient reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the <hi>Being</hi> and the <hi>Providence</hi> of God, is this;
that he would offer some other <hi>Principles,</hi> that he
would advance any other <hi>Hypothesis</hi> and <hi>Scheme</hi>
of things that is more agreeable to the common
and natural Notions of men, and to all Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
of things in the World; and that does bid
more fairly for the comfort and happiness of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
than these Principles of the <hi>Being</hi> of a God,
and of his watchfull <hi>Providence</hi> over the children
of men, do plainly do: And till this be clearly
done, the Principles of Religion which have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
been received by Mankind, and have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in the World in all Ages, cannot fairly be
discarded, and ought not to be disturbed and put
out of Possession. And this, I think, puts this
whole matter upon a very fair and reasonable Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue,
and that nothing more needs to be said con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:98144:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> from what hath been said, in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
Discourse, it naturally follows, That God is
the only Object of our trust and confidence, and
therefore to him alone, and to no other, we ought
to address all our Prayers and Supplications <hi>for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and grace to help in time of need.</hi> But now, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Doctrine and Practise of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Psalmist</hi> here puts a very odd and strange
Question, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee?</hi> To
which they give a quite different answer from what
the <hi>Psalmist</hi> plainly intended, namely, that God was
the sole Object of his hope and trust, and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Him alone he relyed as his onely comfort and
happiness: But to this Assertion of the <hi>Psalmist</hi> the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can by no means agree: They un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
this matter much better than the <hi>Psalmist</hi>
did, namely, that besides God there are in Heaven
innumerable <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> in whom we are to
repose great trust and confidence, and to whom
also we are to address solemn Prayers and Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
not only for temporal good things, but for
the pardon of our Sins, for the increase of our
Graces, and for eternal Life: That there are in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
particular <hi>Advocates</hi> and <hi>Patrons</hi> for all exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies
and occasions, against all sorts of dangers
and diseases, for all Graces and Vertues, and in a
word for all temporal, spiritual, and eternal Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings;
to whom we may apply our selves, without
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98144:17"/>
troubling God and our Blessed Saviour, who also
is <hi>God blessed for evermore,</hi> by presuming upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
occasion to make our immediate Addresses to
Him: For as they would make us believe, though
<hi>Abraham</hi> was ignorant of it and <hi>David</hi> knew it
not, the blessed Spirits above, both Angels and
Saints, do not onely intercede with God for us for
all sorts of Blessings, but we may make direct and
immediate Addresses to them to bestow these
Blessings upon us: For so they do in the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> as is evident, beyond all denyal, from
several of their <hi>Prayers</hi> in their most publick and
authentick <hi>Liturgies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They would indeed fain palliate this matter by
telling us, that by these direct &amp; immediate Addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to Angels and Saints to bestow Grace and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life upon them, they mean no more but only
to pray to them that they would be pleased to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede
with God for these Blessings to be bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon them by their Mediation: But if they
meane no more, why do they say more then they
meane? Why do they use such expressions as to the
common sense and understanding of Mankind do
signify a great deal more than they say they mean;
such expressions, as they themselves do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
if they be understood according to the most
obvious sense of the words, would render them
guilty of flat Idolatry? Especially when they know,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98144:17"/>
that they are charged with Idolatry upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
and since to cleare themselves of it they
will not alter their Prayers, they justly lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the suspition of it.</p>
            <p>And yet admitting what they say in this matter
to be true, and that by these expressions in their
<hi>Prayers</hi> they intend no more but the solemn In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
of Angels and Saints that they would
intercede with God to bestow these Blessings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them for the sake of their Merits, and upon
their Mediation: yet this surely is a great deal
too much, and cannot be done without a high en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment
upon the <hi>Office</hi> of the onely <hi>Mediatour
between God and man, the Man Christ Jesus:</hi> But
let them not deceive themselves, <hi>God is not mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
The Lord our God is a jealous God,</hi> and <hi>He
will not give his Glory to another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have not yet instanced in the grossest part
of their <hi>Superstition,</hi> not to say downright Idolatry,
in this kind; I mean, in their extravagant worship
of <hi>the blessed Virgin</hi> and <hi>Mother of our Lord;</hi> whom
they blasphemously call the <hi>Queen of Heaven;</hi>
and whom by a new style, unknown to the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
and <hi>Primitive Antiquity,</hi> they think to dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
with the <hi>modish</hi> Title of <hi>our Lady;</hi> as if
that could be any addition of honour to <hi>Her,</hi>
whom the <hi>Angel</hi> declared to be <hi>blessed among
Women:</hi> Who, if she know any thing of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98144:18"/>
of Her Worshippers here below, with what
disdain and indignation, do we think She heares
those infinite <hi>Prayers</hi> that are made to Her, and
that <hi>Sacrilegious</hi> Worship which is given Her in
that Church, and which makes both pages of
their Religion; and which for the frequency of
it, both in their publick and private Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
is very much beyond what they give to
God and Christ? As if there were <hi>none in
Heaven but She,</hi> nor <hi>any thing upon Earth</hi> to be
worshipped in comparison of <hi>Her Image.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay so far have they carryed this extravagant
Folly, and how much farther they would have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
it, had not the <hi>Reformation</hi> given a check to
it, God only knows: so far, I say, have they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in this Folly, as, in that famous <hi>Book</hi> of their
<hi>Devotions</hi> called <hi>our Ladyes Psalter,</hi> not only to
apply to Her some part of this <hi>Psalm</hi> out of which
I have taken my <hi>Text,</hi> beginning it thus, <hi>How good
is God to</hi> Israel, <hi>to them that worship his B. Mother?</hi>
But they have likewise profanely <hi>burlesqued,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
afford it a better terme, this whole <hi>Book</hi> of
<hi>Psalms,</hi> applying to <hi>Her</hi> almost the highest things
that are there said concerning <hi>God</hi> and our <hi>Blessed
Saviour. Heare, O Heavens, and give eare O Earth,
and be ye horribly astonished,</hi> to see the best and
wisest Religion in the World transform'd into Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition
and Folly; and to see the most learned
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98144:18"/>
Persons in that Communion set themselves in good
earnest to justify all these follyes and absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
by a grave and groundless pretence to <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly</hi> and <hi>Lastly,</hi> This shews us how neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
the favour of God is to every mans happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
And there is but one way to gain his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and favour, by becoming holy and good
as He is: Then may we rejoice and glory in God,
as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> here does, and say, <hi>Whom have I in
heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I
desire besides thee.</hi> A wicked man dreads God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all things in the World, and he has great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to do so: <hi>For he is not a God that hath pleasure
in wickedness, neither shall evil dwell with him: The
foolish shall not stand in his sight, he hateth all the
workers of iniquity.</hi> When by sin we depart from
God, we forsake our own happiness: <hi>Salvation is
far from the wicked,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 119.</note> says <hi>David.</hi> And againe, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
after the <hi>Text, They that are far from thee shall
perish, but it is good for me to draw near to God:</hi> Now
by holyness and goodness we draw near to <hi>Him,</hi>
who alone can make us happy.</p>
            <p>It is certainly the common interest of mankind
there should be a God, because we cannot possibly
be happy without Him: But then it is no mans
interest to be wicked, because thereby we make
<hi>Him</hi> our Enemy <hi>in whose favour is life,</hi> and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98144:19"/>
upon whom all our hopes of happyness do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend.</p>
            <p>To conclude, if we would have God for our
Happiness, we must be sure to make Him our Friend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and then we may promise to our selves all those ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
which the Friendship of so great and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
a Patron can give us: And there is but one
way to establish a firm Friendship between God
and us, and that is, by doing his Will, and living in
obedience to his Laws: <hi>Ye are my friends,</hi> saith our
Blessed Lord, <hi>if ye do whatsoever I command you: This
is the love of God,</hi> saith <hi>St. John, that we keep his
commandments:</hi> And to love God is the way to be
made partakers of those glorious <hi>things which God
hath prepared for them that love Him: such as eye
hath not seen, nor eare heard, neither have entred into
the heart of man:</hi> Which God of his infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
grant we may all at last be made partakers
of, for his mercies sake in <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi>
To whom with Thee O Father, and the
<hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> be all honour and glory, domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and power, both now and for ever.
<hi>Amen.</hi>
