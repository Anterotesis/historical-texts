            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

A treatise which though at the first it seeme very hard and vnpleasaunt, yet whosoeuer wyll vouchsafe the dyligent reading thereof shall reape thereout no lesse commoditie then a body repleate with hewmours recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth by the medicinable purgacion.

For otherwyse by night &amp; day she will morne, sighe, tattle, and murmure. There are thrée thinges that suffer not a man to abyde in his owne house. Smooke, Rayne, and an euil wyfe. She: sayth she (meaning by some of hir neighbors wyues) goeth better apparreled, and is better estemed of all men. But I am most miserable in all places where I come, and therefore am despised and contempned of all men. She will onely be loued &amp; lawded. Affirming the loue of an other to be the hatred of hir: And the prayse of another, she suspecteth to be hir disprayse. You must loue all that she loueth, and hate all that she hatethe. She will haue the vpper hand and ouercome, but she can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abyde to be ouercomen. She will not be maystred, but she aspyreth to mayster. She wold haue power to doe all thinges and would want nothing.</p>
            <p>If she be fayre, she will easily be loued. If she be foule, then is she not easily liked. But it is hardly kept which of many is desyred. And it is greuous to possesse that which no man will vouchsafe to haue. One soliciteth the fayre with liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all gifts and rewards, an other wooeth her by brauerie. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother by witt and pollicie, a nother with merry conceyts, and one way or other she is caught, which is so on all sides beseadged. An Asse, an Horse, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bedd, a garment, a cuppe &amp; a glasse, are prouid first and then bought. But the wyfe is scarcely séene so soone, but that she doth some wayes offend before she be maryed. And yet howsoeuer it happen, they must be had. Whether she be foule, filthie, sicke, folish, proude, wilfull, or what fault soeuer she haue, (but onely for fornication) a wiefe maye not be put away from her husband.

Here vpon also God is called inflexible or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable. Not for that he can not be pleased or appeased, or for that by his prouidence he setteth necessitie vpon things. But bicause his foresights and ordinances are vnuariable, infallible, and most certayne. Neyther is there any thing (comparing it to the eternall and prouident regard of the diuyne vnderstandyng) that can be thought casuall, or that changeth by happe.

That as well by the terror of punishment, as by the loue of those ioyes we might be induced to eschue and hate sinne. Also there are set down two (as it were) entyer parts of rightuousnesse.

For a man must marke who did it, by what helpe, or assis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance hée dyd worke, in what place, what tyme, to what purpose, and in what manner it was done. But for asmuch as the action taketh his proper kinde by thende or purpose where vnto it tendeth, therefore worke it selfe is of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stáunce of the action. And therefore when the ende and the worke are termed circumstaunces, it is not to be vnderstode of the principall ende or action, in that that it is properly, but it is ment by some ende adioyned, and by some proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie applyed about the worke or action. Of these circumsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces this one. Is of greatest consideration. That is to saye: To what ende any thinge is done. And therefore to the more vnlawfull, or wicked, ende, or purpose, any thing be done, the fault is so much the more agreuated. And if any man pretend his worke to sundry ends or purposes whiche are forbydden, the more, and the more peruerse that these endes be, so much greater is the enormytie of his sinne. As if any man doe steale to the end and purpose that hée maye maynteyne delyghtes, banquitinge, and whoredome, yea, or to attayne thereby worldely promotion.

But the wicked (sayth hée) yea, although hée reigne, is yet the seruant of as many maisters as he hath vices.

               </p>
               <p>Thyrdly, bicause it kepeth man back from glory. For the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> penytent shall not enter vntill, through Christ his merites and mercy, he be restored to the purenesse which he had in baptisme.</p>

Yea and it happeneth often tymes that the sinner being penite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t doth yet (by the dreggs and reliques of his old accustomed sinnes) become more cold in his affections, more ready to the lothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somenesse of good thinges, darker in his vnderstandinge, weaker to doe well, and much more frayle and féeble to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the euill. And therefore Augustyne in his eleuenth booke <hi>de ciuitate dei</hi> doth say: Our mynde (sayth he) in the which reason and vnderstanding naturally haue residence, doth become vnable and weake (by certein cold and darkesome vices) not onely to cleaue to the fruicion of God but also to beare and abyde that vnchangable light. Untill suche tyme that beinge from day to day healed and renewed, it maye be made capable of such great felycitie. Whereby it is manifest how foolyshely they behaue themselues which foreslowe their conuersions and saye that after a certayne tyme they wilbe altogither conuerted yet remayninge the meane while in their vices and wickednesse. For they doe not rightly weighe into how many daungers, perrilles, &amp; hurtes, they fall in the meane tyme. And therefore sinne doth alwayes hurt many men.</p>
               <p>First, him which sinneth.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               </p>
               <p>Secondarily, the neighbours and all the church of god.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Bicause in the meane while the neighbour thereby taketh offence, and the church it selfe, which is an armye to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Deuill, is (by a certayne kynde of meane) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

also diminyshed, and weakened, by him which is wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conuersant and occupied.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it hurteth also those that are dampned. Bicause <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the more that discend into hell the greater horror, howling, and tormentes there are. For that prouerbe hath there no place whiche sayth: <hi>Solatium est misero, socium habere mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seriae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly it hurteth (by a certayne meane) the blessed in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> their habytations. By meane of subtraction. For the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more copyous that the number of the blessed is, the reward accidentall is thereby made the greater, by the happy socyety, one of them gloryinge in an others feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie.</p>
               <p>And lastly, the sinner doth incurre many euills and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> by relapse into his olde vices. For his faultes are made the greater, and so more hardly to be forgeuen. As Ieremy witnesseth saying: Now vyle art thou made by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning<note place="margin">

More preuayled the encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing euill then the vncustomed goodnesse. Lastly euen the sinner himselfe beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth more impotent to ryse. And thus behold (my welbeloued) how many and how vnspeable euill thinges a man doth incurre by sinning. And suerly if thou doe not amend thy liefe by reading and knowing these hurts, and daungers whiche come by sinne. If thou doe not detest and abhorre sinne, if thou doe not walke in pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of lyfe before God, then shalt thou bée vnexcusable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproued of great faultes by thyne owne vertues.

how truly Augustine spake in his twelfe booke <hi>De ciuitate del:</hi> saying: Synne hurteth nature. And by that meanes it is contrary to nature.

This is the way of the chosen, the vnspotted way, the way of all vertue, leading (by the trauayle of repentance) vnto euerlasting rest and quyet. And of this way the Psalmist sayth: Blessed are they whose<note place="margin">Psal. 118.</note> wayes are vncorrupted, and which walke in the lawes of the Lord their God. And therevpon Iob sayde: I kepte the<note place="margin">Iob. 21.</note> way of the lord, and did not decline from it. As also Ieremie<note place="margin">Hiere. 6.</note> sayde: Aske which is the good way, and walke therein, and you shall fynde a refreshing for your soule. But now: there is another way of the reprobate, a darkesome way, (that is to say) a wicked and vngodly way, which lacketh the light of true vnderstanding, &amp; is not guyded with the light of grace. But is obfuscate and darkened with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cloudes of passions and concupise<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, peruerting &amp; ouerthrowing all iust iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp; leadeth to the dungeon of infernal darknesse.

For in this slippery and damnable way, (which séemeth good vnto the wicked, although the end thereof doe leade vnto death) men fal from the highest, vnchaungeable, and moste blessed God, vnto a chaungeable, frayle, and vayne apparaunce of goodnesse, from the state of grace and saluation, vnto the state of gylte and condempnation, from a spirituall lyfe, to a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall lyfe, and in the ende, from the right waye to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernall pryson.

               <p>The Apostle Paule in his seconde Chapiter to the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathyans<note place="margin">Of three sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry sortes of trauaylers in these pathes.</note> sayeth: I am fastened to the Crosse in Christ.

               <p>And surely this is the holesome doctrine of christian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. That for the transgression of our forefathers, all ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kind was depryued of their pleasant habitation in the terrestiall Paradyce, and throwne out into this world, as into a vale of miserie, into a place of banishment, and a countrey far from our natiue residence. To the end that through the bloud of Christ Iesu, we might in this worlde shewe the fruites of true repentaunce, and incessantly bewayle our owne cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, vntil we may be thought worthie after this life, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the place of rest, or euerlasting kingdome prepared for the elect children of God.</p>

of the fruite prohibited, but wee muste returne therevnto agayne by humilitie, obedience, contempnyng of the visible goodnesse, and by brideling our carnall appetytes. And therefore in this lyfe we are called Trauaylers or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring men, bicause as the Apostle sayth: We haue not here<note place="margin">Hebr. 13.</note> any certayne residence, but we must séeke for it in the world to come.

Neyther yet that hée busie hym selfe to entermedle with thinges done by other men whome hée passeth by in his iourney, but that holding the kings highe way, and neyther declining on the righte haude nor on the lefte hande, and being contented with necessarie foode &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, he make hast, &amp; incessantly trauayle with all possible spéede to drawe néere vnto his iourneys end. So ought eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Christian to consider that he is but a trauayler or a way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring man in this present lyfe, and therefore let him so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his whole conuersation, that hee obtayne the felicitie which is to come, and to attayne to the heauenly and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting kingdome of God. Yea let him direct all his steps vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the glorie of God, fulfilling his holy commaundementes, and by such vertuous degrees, let him aspyre vnto the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly habitation. For héere vnto the Apostle Paule doeth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horte<note place="margin">Cor. 7.</note> vs saying: it remayneth that they which vse the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifites of this world, should bee as though they vsed it not.

But bicause it happeneth oftentymes that a trauayler séeing sundrie straunge things in his way, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted therewith, and stayeth to behold such things, or to seeke and inquire of nouelties, whereby he foresloweth his <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

Therefore there is a playner and more perfect way whereby we may goe to the countrey of the chosen. Which is: that a man doe goe not onely by the wayes and meanes alreadie declared, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the heauenly habitation, but furthermore that hée doe not regarde, care for, or séeme to sée, anye impediment, stoppe, or let, in his way. But rather passe by them and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise them as things which appertayne not vnto him. And such trauaylers or wayfaring men are they which care no more for the prayses and commendation of this world, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they doe for their disprayses, no more for prosperitie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for aduersitie, for ryches, then for pouertie. Finally, which doe not (worldly) set their myndes on any of the thinges which delight men in this lyfe, but doe (mortifyedly) set lighte by them all, as by most vayne trifles and toyes.

But the way is straight and the gate narow which leadeth to euerlasting life, and fewe there be which fynde it out. These wordes procéeded from our sauiour Christ, and are reported by his Euangelist saint Mathew. And what could haue bin spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more terrible then these wordes? or what soundeth more thundringly in our eares?

                  </gap>erie many doe walke in the voyde open way to damp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Whereby he doeth ensinuate also that right fewe shal be saued, and verie many dampned. The which he doth more euidently set downe in another place saying: Many are called, but fewe are chosen. Therefore who would not<note place="margin">Math. 22.</note> feare, yea and tremble to heare these wordes, if he be of the faythful, and haue obteyned a liuely beliefe in Christ Jesus? For the faith and true dutie of a christian is such and so mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall, so great and yet so difficult, that although we certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know by the testimonie of Gods spirite the certaintie of our saluation in Christ, yet should euerie wayfaring man in this worlde doe verie well to feare and forecast least hée in respect of infirmitie of fleshe should fall and offende, and so
<pb facs="tcp:3025:86"/>
consequently should doe well to walke in dread and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence before the Lord God. For as we are bound to beleue that after this transitorie lyfe we shall be brought before the Tribunall seate of Christ, the euerlasting God, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallyble, dreadfull, and moste iuste iudge: there to receyue from him eyther euerlasting paynes of hell fyre, or the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting ioyes of heauen: euen so if we behold the same with a cleare and lyuely fayth, it were wonderfull if euer wee should be frée from trembling and dread. But the malice and necligence that is in vs doeth blynde our hartes. For if we were to passe through a field or place full of théeues, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in fewe passengers or wayfaring men had escaped, who were he that would not feare excéedingly to light in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of corporall death? But now we passe and walke dayly through a fielde of this wicked worlde, replenished with all kynde of diuilish temptations. Wherein (as is abouesayde) verie fewe in comparison doe escape dampnation. Neyther yet doe we feare but laugh, playe, sporte, and banquet. Yea we are throughly replenished with a vayne and moste pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous securitie or carefulnesse. But (my welbeloued) let it not bee so, let it not (for Gods sake) beé so amongest vs. Let vs not so superficially heare the wordes of Christ, least we neglect, yea and loose our selues in vnrecouerable, vntol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, and eternall distruction. Let vs rather profoundly, and cunningly, fulfill the wordes of our sauiour, thinking al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes vpon that which is written: Sanctifie the Lorde of<note place="margin">Esay. 8.</note> Hostes, for he is your feare, and your terrour. And agayne:<note place="margin">Prou. 13.</note> Be thou all day in the feare of God, &amp; thou shalt haue wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to hope in the latter day.

Who wil not magnifie and feare thy holy name, bicause thy
<pb facs="tcp:3025:87"/>
iudgements are manifest? But before I wade any further, let me say a little of the wordes before rehearsed of our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ui<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ur Christ. For he sayth that the way is narow &amp; the gate straight, which leadeth to saluation. Or rather (as I take it) he sayth that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way is verie narow, &amp; the gate very straight. For in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he demaundeth interrogatiuèly, how straight is the way. &amp;c. It is to be vnderstood y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he ment very straight and narow. But he plainly affirmeth that the way is broad and spatious which leadeth to euerlasting dampnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And by the wordes before rehearced, the vnderstanding hereof is made manifest. For as I haue a little before alledged, there are two kyndes of wayes which men walke in. One bright &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, (the which is the way of the chosen, which fearfully and carefully serue the Lord God) &amp; that is the straight and narrow way. For as much as knowledge and vertue are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes occupyed about hardest things. (As I will hereafter more playnly declare.) And there is another vitious &amp; dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some way, which is the way or lyfe of the reprobate, the which is accoumpted broad and spatious, bicause it is an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie matter to declyne from the rules of reason, or to faynte from the right lyne of vertue, and to omit the diuine lawes of Gods commaundements. And yet about this poynte the Philosophers had some question: not altogither vnprofitable héere to be rehearsed. For whereas by their opinion, reason coueteth alwayes to the best things, &amp; vertue (by Damas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenes opinyon) is accordyng to nature consenting vnto rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: yea and by Tullyes, or rather by Augustines and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siles opinion, there are certayne sparkes or séedes of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues borne and bredde in vs, it might séeme thereby that vertue were verie easie and light to be followed. Whervn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I would answere that God surely hath put in vs by rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration wil to follow vertues wherby (by grace) they might séeme light and eas<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

For there are almoste vnnumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble impedimentes of vertues which doe dayly happen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, as well by the meanes of our owne fleshe, as also by the world and the diuell.

and the world also doeth present many (nay to many) offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and lets from doing well &amp; vertuously. So that it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie harde alwayes to kéepe in the meane and middle of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and neuer to decline to any of the vitious extreames. But yet (as Dyonisius teacheth) vertue it selfe, or the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therof procéedeth of an entire and vniuersal cause, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all the circumstances of vertue it self doe concurre.

And Christ made answere in the first of Luke, saying: stryue ye to enter or goe in by the narow gate.

And furthermore for the better vnderstanding howe straight and narow the way is which leadeth to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, marke we the words of Gregorius saying: The straight and narow way wherin euerie man is constrained to walk, (which doth carefully regard the fulfilling of Gods commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Then if we déeyely and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually consider that it is for Gods loue that we doe such thinges as we take in hand, we shall then thinke nothing to be hard or difficulte.

Yea they desyre and reioyse to be vncessantly occupyed and conuersant in the prayses of God, and walke in the streight &amp; narrowe way with great delight and pleasure. Herevpon it is that Gregorius wytnesseth saying: loue is as strong as death. For (sayth he) euen as death doth kyll the corporall body, so the loue of God dothe (through the hope of eternall lyfe) kyll in vs the loue of temporall delightes.

But if you marke my wordes well, you shall perceyue, that since euerie man which loueth the worlde doeth thereby become an eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie vnto God, it falleth out also that the contempt of thys world is of necessitie vnto saluation. Wherevpon some cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious mynd might in<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>erre that all secular people which are maryed and therby doe loue eche other, should (hereby) stand in state of condempnation. Wherevnto I answere that loue is to be taken diuers wayes, as well in Philosophie, as also in diuinitie. For both Plato &amp; Pythagoras did exhort theyr schollers and sects to dispyse the world. But to come vnto a more perticuler distinction.</p>
               <p>First the world is taken for the Element of earth, or for the whole globe and compasse of this earthly habitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And so it is taken in the Gospell where Christ spake vnto his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles saying: Goe you out into the whole world and preach the Gospell to all creatures. And the Philosophers doe say that the least Starre of the fyrmament is bigger then the whole world.</p>
               <p>Secondarily, it is taken for the whole regyon of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and their myxtures. Wherevpon it may be that the Apostle sayd: The fygure of this world doth passe ouer. And to that sence the Prince of Philosophers sayde. This world
<pb facs="tcp:3025:95"/>
(sayeth hée) must be adioyning vnto the cources of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er powers. That the whole vertue and power thereof may thereby be gouerned.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the worlde is taken for the whole corporall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce created<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And so Plato in his booke <hi>de Timaeo,</hi> doth séeme to bring in the s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nsible world.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the world is taken for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole vniuersal thing, in the which visible and vnuisible separate and materyall substances are comprehended. And thereof this text may be ment: The world was made by him. Yea so also the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher sayeth: Nothing is without the world.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, by the world is taken for men remayning in thys world, or for all mankynd. Whervpon it was that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle sayde: Let all the whole worlde be subi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>cte vnto God. And Christ him selfe sayde: This Gospell of the kyngdome shall be preached and declared in the whole world.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, the world is taken for the chosen and predestinate vnto saluation. Whervpon we read: So God loued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world that he gaue his onely begotten sonne. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, the world is taken for the peruerse and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. Wherevpon our sauiour sayde vnto the Iewes: you are of this world. But I am not of this world (that is to say) of the number of vngodly men, leading a vayne and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lyfe. Of which number you are your selues. And agayne he sayde vnto his Apostles: Bicause you are not of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> world, but I haue chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. And in this sence y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world is most commonly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in scriptures, especially in the Gospell and Epistles of Saint Iohn.</p>
               <p>And last of all, a father of the Church which hath written a treatise of the vanitie of this world, doeth take this word: The world for the changeablenesse of mans conuersation in this lyfe. Since then the holy scriptures doe bid the worlde to be contempned and hated, according to that saying: Loue you not the world nor those which are therein.</p>
               <p>Therefore by this word: The world we must vnderstand
<pb facs="tcp:3025:95"/>
worldly and vayne creatures bent vnto transitorie and not vnto heauenly things. Yea and there with must we compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend earthly substance, and such thinges as the worldlings doe most accoumpt, as temporal prosperitie, carnal delights, to be praysed and honoured, and to become rich and clyme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lofte. For all these sensible and temporall things are to bée contempned and hated. Not as touching their verie beyng, but bicause they hynder and stoppe vs in the way, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slow our iourney vnto the heauenly kingdome. And we must contemp<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e and hate them, least we doe cleaue and stick fast in the myre of them. As they doe which sette theyr chiefe end and felicytie in frayle and transitorie things, séekyng, louyng, wyshing, and desiryng them more then they doe God.</p>
               <p>Therefore whensoeuer wée sée any man to prosper excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly in this world, and to leade a voluptuous conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on accordyng to his appetite, let vs neither estéeme nor mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie him. Let vs not affect such kynde of lyfe, nor greatly set by (but rather dispyse) suche a man. I meane not that wée shoulde hate hym in nature, nor dispyse his person absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but hys vyces, and him selfe, in so much that by them he is eloygned and estranged from God.</p>
               <p>Wherevpon the Psalmist sayeth of the iust man: The<note place="margin">Psal. 14.</note> wicked was brought to naught in his sight. But suche as feare God, hee glorifieth. Aristotle in hys Ethyckes hath this sentence: Magnanimytie is full of contempt, for it setteth light by those which lyue vylely.</p>
               <p>All this notwithstanding, we ought to bestow the affects of charitie and godly compassion vpon those which are wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and vniust, accordyng to their necessitie. Yea and muche the more bycause we sée them to be wrapped and enfolded, yea blynded and muffled to reioyce, florish, and exalte them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in this worlde. And therevpon Hierome sayeth: wée more weigh &amp; marke sinners to be most wretched, when we perceyue their faultes to be lefte vnpunished. Yea both hée and Ambr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

Now therefore let vs well consider how it comes to passe that the contempt and hatred of this world is of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie to saluation. For vnlesse it had bene by some maner of meanes necessarie to saluation, the Apostle Iohn had not sayde: if any man loue the world, the charitie &amp; loue of God<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>. Ioan. 2.</note> the father is not in him. It is therefore to be sayd, that there are two kyndes of hating and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the world, speaking generally thereof.</p>
               <p>The first whereof is: that the world and such things as are therein should be contempned and hated, for as much as they doe directly hynder and withhold vs from God. That is to say, least they be loued more then God, or contrarie to his will and commaundements. And least any man should take felicitie in them, and cleaue wholly vnto them contrarie to the lawes of God in holy scriptures contayned. Least he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre earthly goods before heauenly goods, and least hée set the temporall prayses and honours of this lyfe, before the celestial ioyes prepared. And finally, least he loue and estéeme this present lyfe more then the lyfe to come. And for these reasons the hating and dispising of the world are necessarie vnto saluation. So that euerie man is bound (in that sort) to hate &amp; dispise the world, as wel single men as maryed folke. The which lesson I iudge to be verie difficult vnto suche as dwel and remayne in this world. Now the second kynde or maner of dispising and hating the world, is executed by the ful and absolute aband<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ning &amp; denying of all worldly things. As if any man dispising and throwing from him the ryches and delightes of this lyfe, should choose to serue God in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and more priuate lyfe.</p>
               <p>So that (in this sence) to hate and dispise the world, is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly<note place="margin">He meaneth not Monkes nor Fryers I trust.</note> to refuse &amp; cast of all temporall things, seculer pomps, yea worldly maners and dignities, and so to dispise all the vanities of this lyfe that we may walke in the righte way
<pb facs="tcp:3025:96"/>
by the assistance of Gods grace and holy spirit. And whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer doeth thus, he is sure to displease and offend worldly men. For euen as lykenesse of things is a cause of loue and well pleasing, so vnlikenesse is the originall cause and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of hatred, and withdrawing of myndes and affections. Herevpon the Apostle asked this question: Doe I (sayth he) séeke to please men? If I should yet please men, I should not be the seruant of Christ. And lykewyse the Psalmist sayeth: God hath broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in sunder the bones of such as séeke to please men. They were consumed bicause god dispised the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Is not this a most horrible and dreadfull worde? For what can bée more fearefull then to bée dispised of God? since Salomon<note place="margin">Eccle. 7.</note> sayeth: Consider the workes of God, since no man can ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him which God dispiseth.

Yea and that by the desire of so contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>platyue and holy meditations, thou mayest with all thy hart and mynde be giuen ouer vnto him. All which can not come to passe vnlesse thou dispise all corporal delightes, all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vanities, and all thine owne desires. As Cassianus affyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth saying: our affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s (saith he) are neuer perfectly kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the desire of eternal things, neither is our vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng euer sharpened vnto the perfect contemplation of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly thinges, vntill the cares and desires of the fleshe bee perfectly bridled in vs. My (welbeloued) if thou wilt be rich, and a possessor of infinite goods and treasures, giue eare then vnto the counsell of Ambrose. He that wil (sayth he) possesse God, let him first renounce the world, that God may be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him a blessed possession and heritage. For looke how much thou dye vnto y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> world, so much lyfe thou gaynest with God. And the more that thou lyue as to this worlde, so muche the more thou dyest vnto God.</p>
               <p>To conclude, whosoeuer loueth the world, doeth loue an enimie, imbraseth a Traytor, and dandleth in his lappe an vnspeakeable daunger.</p>
               <p>Wherevpon Augustyne sayde: if this world delight thée, thou shalt alwayes be vncleane.

For the thinges which are séene are temporall, but the things which are not séene are eternall. By these wordes of Paule it appeareth that the trybulations of the chosen (although they be longe, bytter, and gréeuous) yet by regarde of the celestyall glory and reward to come, they are lyght and but of small conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newaunce. For the reward to come is vncomprehensible &amp; euerlasting. But now is he a perfect and most pure louer of God, which loueth him not by beholding this reward, nor reuerenceth him not for desire of his owne profite, nor wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipeth him for reward of mutuall consideration towardes himselfe: But which purely (for the very incomparable good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, loue, and worthynesse of God) doth all that he can to his honour with all dilygence. For the better obteyning of

which perfection, and for the full purchasing of so great sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie in Gods loue, let vs yet euen by the beholding of the infallible promyses of God, goe stoutly forewarde to doe any thing that may be most pleasant, most perfect, and moste ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable vnto him. And let vs contempne the world and the gallantnesse, delight, pompe, prosperities, and vanities ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, taking in hand to walke in the way of perfection, in the fulfilling of Gods word, and in a vertuous and right religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous lyfe. For since the eternall God, is a most frée goodnesse, a most feruent charitie, and a most plentifull rewarder, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a man of reasonable vnderstanding wil confesse that the more he refuseth and layeth aside for his sake, the more sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely that he renounce him selfe, the more he dispose him selfe to the obtayning of Gods giftes, and the more wholly, perfectly, and entyrely that he offer him self vnto him, euen so much the more will God also she we him selfe the more aboundant in mercies to him, the more soundly and swéetly he will breath his holy spirite into him, the more familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he will be conuersant with him, and the higher wil he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alte him in glorie, multiplying his giftes of grace in this present lyfe, and dooblyng his rewards of glorie in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> world to come. Whervpon it is written in holy scripture: if a man doe direct his harte vnto God, he shall drawe his breath and spirite towardes him selfe. And here vpon the holy, true, and mercifull God hath promised not onely a blessed and exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent glorification, in the heauenly kingdome, but also a most plentuous and liberall reward in this present lyfe, to suche as dispise the world for his sake. Saying in his holy gospel: Whosoeuer leaueth father &amp; mother, his brethren or frends, or his possessions for my names sake, he shal receyue an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth folde, &amp; shall possesse euerlasting lyfe. And what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth he by these wordes: He shall receyue an hundreth fold?

Beholde what an vnspeakable dignitie this is, &amp; how they are honored of God, which for his honor do forsake all things. And thervpon Gregorie sayth: whosoeuer béeyng styrred with the prick, or goade of godly zeale, doeth forsake such things as he héere possesseth, shall vndoubtedly obtayne there a height of iuditiall dignitie, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he may come to iudge with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> iudge, bicause by consideration of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudgement, he did chaste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> himself willingly with pouertie.

And so shalt thou become a right riche man aboue all them that loue this world. For Hierome sayeth: those onely are to be accompted true ryches, which make vs aboundant in all vertues.

who peraduenture yet hast not obserued the holy precepts in all poyntes from thy youth bywardes.

Of whom Salomon sayeth: the number of fooles is infinyte. And the holy fathers haue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweared thys kynde of obiection at large.</p>
               <p>For there is great difference in iudgement betwéene that which is requyred to the conseruation and mayntenance of the first vndeuidable substance, and that which is requisite to the conseruation and mayntenance of the forme or lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.

               <p>For I pray thée tell mée, if thou shouldest altogither giue ouer the world, and giue thy selfe to a holy and solitarie life, should the world therfore fayle?

               <p>Christ spake (as his Euangelist John rehearseth in the<note place="margin">Of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of the worlde by the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Christ.</note> eight Chapiter) saying: I am the light of the worlde.

                  </gap> Leo did right Clerkely affyrme, saying: The
<pb facs="tcp:3025:105"/>
whole vyctorie of our Sauiour whereby hee ouercame both the worlde and the diuill, was begunne and finyshed in true humilitie.</p>
               <p>Furthermore as Bernard witnesseth, Christ did alwayes choose those things which were most greuous vnto <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>esh and bloud, and which did most declare hum<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>tie. For he chose a poore mother, of whom he was contented to be borne in the middest of the colde winter, in the middest of darke night, in a strange place, and in a homely Cribbe. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was borne he was wrapped in a fewe torne cloutes, and layde in the Oxe Maunger. Yea moreouer when of him selfe he was ryche and aboundant, or rather the verie true, highest, and omnipotent God, he became poore for our sakes. And so poore that he sayd: The birdes of the ayre haue their neasts, &amp; the Fores their dennes, but the sonne of man hath not where to hide his head. And how many persecutions he suffred &amp; endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red<note place="margin">Math. 8.</note> by the Jewes is sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly testified by the Euangelists. For some saide vnto him: Hee hath a diuill, and the man is<note place="margin">Iohn. 10.</note> madde. Some called him glutton, bibber of wine, and friend<note place="margin">Math. 11.</note> to the Publicans. Some sayd that by Bekebub chief prince of the diuils he cast out wicked spirites. Other sayde: How is this man from God, and we know that hee is a sinner. Will he kill him selfe. Sometymes they would stone him, some other whyles throwe him downe headlong, and at last they betrayed hym, and put him to a moste vyle kynde of death. But in all these thinges what dyd the innocent Lambe of God, the sonne of the euerlastyng Father? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth hee was patient, hée restored good for euill, he spake wordes of saluation and health euen to the vnthankefull people, he prayed for them which crucifyed him, like a shéepe hee was ledde to the Slaughter, and he lay still and helde his peace lyke a Lambe in the Shéepshearers hands.

<pb facs="tcp:3025:106"/>
wounded for our offences. And therefore stretched out vpon the Crosse. Yea his hands and féete were pearced with hard nayles vntill all his bones might be numbred. And thus it was expedient that Christ should suffer and enter into hys glorie. Then if we desire to bee christians and of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber chosen to be saued, what remayneth for vs to doe? euen that we follow and imitate Christes pouertie, humilitie, and patience. That we chastise our owne bodies by the true fruites of repentance. That we crucifie our fleshe with all the vyces and concupiscenses thereof. That we make haste to walke in the narrow path with all feare and carefulnesse. That we be not ouercome with euyll, but let vs vanquishe the euill with goodnesse. Let vs not rendre euil for good vnto any man. Let vs not pampre and cherish our fleshe in myse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable delights. Nor let vs geue place to any lightnesse, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nytie, or toyes. Whosoeuer can obserue these poyntes, he <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>yspyseth the world happyly, he ouer commeth himselfe lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably, and he learneth of Christ what it is to be méeke and humble of heart. For aboue all thinges we must founde all our conuersacion in true humylitie. Wherevpon Leo, spake grauely sayinge: All the dysciplyne of christyan lyfe doeth not consist in cunning wordes, in sharpenesse of wytte, in dysputacion, nor in vayne desyrs of glory and prayse, but in the true and voluntary humilitie which our Lorde and Sauiour Jesus Christ dyd choose and teache (as the stou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test kynde of defence) euen from the wombe of his mother vnto the deathe of the crosse.</p>
               <p>Whereby it appeareth also how trwe it is that Cypryan sayeth: All the lyfe of man, (if hée lyue lyke a chrystian, and according to the Gospell) is a crosse and a martyrdome. As also Chrysostome trwely sayeth: No man may well be termed a chrystian, vnlesse he be conformed vnto Chryst in maners and conuersacion. Wherefore (my beloued) if wée knowe that Jesus Christ is our sauiour and Lorde, let vs blushe and bée ashamed if wée bée not founde conformable vnto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3025:106"/>Let vs be abashed to lyue, carnally, delycately, &amp; su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pteously. To ioy &amp; tryumphe in mens prayse &amp; fauour. To séeke cheifly our owne commodytie and preferment. And to walke puffed vp with a vayne and a proude hart. For our lyfe is in the myddest betwéene the Angels and Beastes. If we liue accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleshe, we are to be compared vnto Beastes. But if we lyue according to the spyrite, we are made fellowes with Angells. And if we yéeld to spyrituall sinnes and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, as pryde, ambition, vayne glory, and wicked vany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, we are now coopled vnto Diuills rather then vnto brute Beastes. Especially since that spirytuall vyces (speaking in Genere) are much greater and more gréeuous the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> carnall vyces are. But wouldest thou knowe who were rightly to be termed a christian? He is truely a christian (sayth Augus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine) which sheweth mercy to all men, which is not moued nor disquyeted with any iniurye, which féeleth another ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s payne or greife as if it were his owne. Whose table is not shut from any poore or néedy. Which is accoumpted of small glory or estimatian before men, to the end he may be glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before God and his Angells. Which dispyseth earthly thinges to obteyne heauenly. Which succoreth thée myse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and afflicted, and is moued to compassio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by other mens teares. Therefore let vs clense our selues from all blottes and blemyshes both of fleshe and spirite. And let vs imy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Christ our King by a wary and a frutefull lyfe, abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and despysing all wrath, all indignation, stoutenesse and fleshelynesse, that being altogither conuerted, we maye be made as little babes agayne.</p>

But dost dayly kéepe company with such as vnhappyly wallowe &amp; toumble in those enormyties, yea if thou doest become a fellowe vnto them, eating, drinking, and walking with them?

Flée from this world which is the enemye to thy soule, conuerte thy selfe wholy and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to the Lord thy God, leaue and forsake (for his sake) all the goods and delights of this lyfe, and he will geue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thée all the treasures and abundaunces in the kingdome of heauen</p>
               <p>Our Sauiour sayth in the seuenth Chapiter of Mathew:<note place="margin">The world is to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned because it is hard (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in) to attayne saluation.</note> He which heareth the word of God and doth it not, is lyke vnto a foolyshe man which buylt his house vpon the sande. The floodes came and the wyndes blewe, and burst into y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> house, &amp; the rewyne thereof was great. The holy fathers doe compare this world to a great and ragyng Sea, which is tossed with tempestes. And is passed with great daungers and many difficultyes.</p>
               <p>Agayne behold the Lorde GOD (with whome all thinges doe consist in an vnchangeable eternytie) as the highest thinge to be séene or beheld vpwardes. And the world it selfe as the lowest thynge downewardes. Then consider (saye they) lykewyse the mynde of man placed as it were in the myddest béetwene them both. The which (by the crcellence of manes condition) doth floate aboue the chaunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenesse of this world and yet hath not attayned the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaungeablenesse
<pb facs="tcp:3025:109"/>
of the diuyne nature. Then if mans minde should chaunce through loue &amp; gréedy desire of these thinges which passe downwards, to drown it selfe therin, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it wilbe ouerthrowen with sundry waues, and beinge (as it were) deuided from it selfe, wil quickly be dyssipate and destroyed.</p>
               <p>But so much the easier it wilbe to gather it altogether on a heape &amp; to preserue it, if it rayse vp it selfe with an earnest thought and desire, forsaking those base and earthly places vntill at last it become altogither vnchaungeable by attey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto that highest, &amp; most excelent immutabylity. Againe when a mans minde doth declyne downewardes by the loue which it hath to earthly thinges, it suffereth shipwracke in the floodes of this world. And being myxed or myngled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest the changeable thinges, doth flowe away with the streame. Yea &amp; it is by a kynde of twofould daunger, tossed &amp; retossed. For both it is in perill to be drowned by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> déepe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection it beareth to the lower parts, and againe by conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne wall working of the waue in multytude of affections, it is meruelously dyssypate and dysseuered. But if it rayse it selfe vpwardes from the loue of this present lyfe by the desire that it hath vnto eternytie, and doe gather together all his thoughtes and cogitations, then doth it (as it were) swym alofte in the floode, and doth spurn and kycke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye all traunsitory thinges as fylth or wéedes swymming lose in the water. Therefore let the mynde of man (as it were) so repose it selfe in safety, by raysing it selfe aboue and on it selfe towardes God and by retorning to it selfe, in it selfe, that by the considerations aforesayd it (béeing raysed aboue the world) maye behold the perylles a farre of and reioyse that it hath by any meanes eskaped them. And this it is to go into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Arke of the hart and the spyrituall Shippe. By helpe whereof we maye happyly eskape the waues of this worlde wherewith we are tossed alwayes. Then spurne from thée and despyse these transitorye and frayle thinges, and behold thou arte swoome and eskaped
<pb facs="tcp:3025:109"/>
out of this great dyluge of roaring waters. Consider déepely and medytate the heauenly Sacraments of thy redemption, together with the benefytes of the diuine goodnesse bestowed vpon thée, and thou art alredy entred into the Arke of thy hart and the Shippe aforesayde. Againe this world is most conueniently compared vnto a large féelde full of crewell théeues and robbers. In the which many are kylled and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and very few eskape at any tyme vnwounded or not sore hurt. Yea &amp; that which is worst, they which walke com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in this field doe betray eche other into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hands of those théeues. That is whilest one of them doth leade another into the fall of finne, whereby he falleth into the diuells handes. And thou (my welbeloued) if thou wouldest be afeard to walk in such a féelde replenished with théeues who might endaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger thée with temporall death, how darest thou then walke through this wycked worlde, wherein so many enemies are suborned by wycked spyryts, and so many stumbling blockes are layed to make thée fall into euerlasting fyre?</p>
               <p>Agayne this world is compared to a wood set on fyre wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (in maner) all the trées are burnt and destroyed. For we maye dayly behold howe the loue and charytie of God is waxed colde in mens hartes, how the loue of the world hath preuayled, howe the fyre of concupyscence, the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentnesse of pryde, and the flame of couetousnes are kynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. In such sorte that (almost) euerye man séeketh to shyfte for himselfe. And neuer séeketh Christe Jesus nor those thinges which pertayne vnto his glorye. Men are carefull for worldly sustenaunce, and not for the purenesse of the soule, nor the cleanennesse of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hart. Yea they doo rather séeke to avoyde the dysco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities of this present lyfe, then to eskape the bytter and eternall tormentes of hell fyre. And howe then darest thou chuse but be carefull how to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kape out of this woode? yea and that with spéede least thou be burned and consumed with the fyre of vyce &amp; lewdenesse?

the enemyes may aproch and assault it on euery syde. So that it is now no safe dwelling therein. But we must flye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to some stronger place of defence. For if we doo rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider our owne frayltie, how prone we are to euyll, and how slow to goodnesse, we shall fynde it requisite to séeke some safer resting place for our soules, wherein we may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eschew and auoyde all occasions of sinnes.</p>

Although these wordes be lytterally to be expounded by the Church which is the vniuersall Spouse of Christ, yet may they also be vnderstoode by euery faythfull soule and mynde which is also the perticuler Spouse of Christ. For as Sainct Augustine sayth: euery soule is eyther the spouse of Christ, or the diuells concubyne. And therefore the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet saying: Forget thy people and thy fathers house, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, despise these earthly thinges in respect of God and for his sake.

Yea make thy selfe ryche of spirituall ryches, and adorne and decke thy selfe with all grace and vertue. For the more perfectly that thou contempne worldly thinges, so much the more thou shalt be replenyshed with heauenly treasure. As Gregory sayth: He doth very well withdraw his loue from the creatures, which doth onely with the eyes of his hart and vnderstanding, beholde the excedinge bright bewtie and louelynesse of the Creatour. So that (my deare and chrystian brother) if thou doo so, the kyng of kynges, the lorde of lordes, the onely begotten sonne of GOD, wyll ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly desyre thy coomelynesse. That is, thyne inward coome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynesse, thyne inward reformation, the bryghtnesse of thy wysedome, and the feruentnesse of thy loue.

thée being so fayre and louely. He will blesse thée with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly light and the true fruites of the holy Ghost. He will assocyate thée vnto him for euer. So that thou mayest enioye him thy fill most swé<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

Then let vs (for gods sake) by the beholding of so great profit, and by the desyre and affection whiche we ought to haue vnto so greate nobyli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, learne to contempne euen from our hartes this moste vayne, varyable, néedye, frayle, &amp; intysing world, which with draweth vs from God.

                  </gap> saying: A reasonable soule created to the lykenesse of God, maye be occupyed in all thinges, but it cannot be replenyshed, satysfied, nor fulfilled.

               <p>And agayne he sayeth: When God the Lord shall come to iudge, the world shall pytiously roare and crye. One Tribe shall shocke and iustle agaynst another.

The reprobate which are to be dampned séeing these thinges, shalbe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with a horryble feare, they shall mourne and languish for vexacion of spyrite and say: We haue erred from the waye of truth and the light of righteousnesse hath not shy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in vs. We haue ouerweryed our selues in the waye of iniquytie. Wherefore (my welbeloued) let vs learne and chuse (with the chosen of God) to abhorre the delightes of
<pb facs="tcp:3025:113"/>
the world, to bringe forth the true fruites of repentaunce, to serue God with dew reuerence, feare, and purenesse of hart, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to encurre wylfully so great callamyties. For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer doth dyligently and profoundly reuolue &amp; ponder these paynes and tormentes of hell fyre, he shall vndoubtedly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre all sinne, all vanitie and prayse of this wicked world. For what a thinge is it to be for euer enclosed in the pryson of hell, in the myddest of vnquencheable fyre, in a moste fylthie stinckinge and lothesome lake, there to be vnspeake ably tormented, and with innumerable paynes to bée af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flycted, without any least hope of deliuerie? For Gregorie sayth, there shalbe in hell vntollerable colde, vnquenchea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fyre, a worme alwayes gnawing, a stynche alwayes smellynge, palpable darkenesse, the skourge euer stryking, the ougly spyrites alwayes gréeuing, the confusion of sinnes, the desperacion of all goodnesse, the hate and detestinge of all that is good and ryghteous, an vnremedyable turning backe from the highe heauenly maiestie, and an irecupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble turning towardes all euill and frayltie.</p>
               <p>For although in hell there be the prycke of payne and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyshement, yet there is no corection nor amendement of will and consent. Synce the reprobate shalbe so accused with their owne iniquinye, that righteousnesse neuerthelesse shall not by any meanes be of them embraced, loued, or desired. But what néede we to heape to gether somanye wordes of proofe of this matter? Doe thou thy selfe imagnne to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold (with the eyes of fayth and vnderstanding) a lake full of all myserie, yea most brymfull of all desperation, trouble, crying, and howlyng, boyling, with a most skalding fyre, and abundantly replenyshed with most sorowfull soules, and then consider what a thinge it were to be for euer gréeued and tormented therein to walke contynually in the blase of such flamyng fyres, to be racked and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vncessantly, and to be perpetually afflycted with the most horryble socyetie of the dampned, and the moste ougly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and shapes of the Diuills? For this is it which in the

booke of Job is called the Tenebrous land ouerwhelmed with the thycke cloudes of death. The land of myseryes &amp; darkenesse, where the shadow of death, and no order, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall horrur doth enhabyt. For ouer and besides other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit paynes of hell, there is also troublesome, paynefull, and vnestymable dysorder co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tineually.

Wherefore let vs come forth &amp; forsake this broade &amp; ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> way of these world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynges leading vnto destruction and vnhappinesse, and let vs embrace and followe the streyght waye, lyuing fruitefully, fearefully, &amp; reuerently before y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Maiesty of the highest God.</p>
               <p>Yt is written in the lxxxiii. Psalm: How louely &amp; delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full<note place="margin">The glorye of the blessed is a principall meane to make vs to contempne this world.</note> are thy Tabernacles O Lord god of vertues? my soule doth eagerly desire and faynte in the Court of God. And as the doctors and Fathers of the Church haue agréed, the loue and charytie of God is the lyfe of the soule. So that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loue and charytie, nothing is pleasing, nor acceptable before God. Neither can it profite any thing at all towards the obteyning of the heauenly felycitie. Then all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, our thoughts, affections, speaking, doing, or suffering, cannot be acceptable in the sight of God, vnlesse it procéede from charytie, eyther by way of allurement, by way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, or by way of direction. Wherevpon it folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that such as doe bewayle, confesse, and repent, their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déedes onely for feare of payne, for seruyle dreade, they doe not therefore obtayne forgeuenesse. For euery good déede, ought to be done for the zeale of iustice and righteousnesse, and for Godly charytie, but not for feare. Thereof the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saied: If I speake with the tonges of Angels and of men, and yet haue not charytie in mée, it shall nothinge profit mée.

By this dread is vnderstoode and ment the seruyle feare which onely and principally dothe respect the punishment and correction. Of the which sainct Iohn sayeth: There is no feare in perfect charitie. Then si<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ce we might be enduced (as hath béen beforesayde) to the contempt of this world by the consideracion of death, iudgement, &amp; the paines of hell, yet ought we much more &amp; by much stronger reason to be enduced therevnto by the consideracion contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion and loue of the perpetuall blessednesse &amp; glory of the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen. The which is of a certayne infinit dignitie, since it is an immedyate frewition of that vnmeasurable, good, holy, and glorious God. Wherefore as this frewition is altogether supernaturall, we can neuer atteyne therevnto but by super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall meanes. As thankeful thanksgeuing, Fayth, Hope, Charitie, &amp; the other gyftes of the holy Ghost. And the more perfectly and plenteously that these meanes doo dwel &amp; abyde in vs, so much the more vehemently we despise all worldly &amp; temporal things &amp; plainly perceue their, vanitie, vylenesse, &amp; doo Yea we doo so much y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faster, more affectionately, more abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, more swyftly &amp; vncessantly, aspyre, go fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, approch, or rather runne outryght towards y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the heauenly Paradyse &amp; habitacion Embrasing &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting all the helpe, fauour, &amp; assystance of gods holy spirit more redyly and more chearefully.

Chapter of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastes.<note place="margin">The disquiet labour and troubles of this worlde enduce the contempt of the shame.</note> God hath giuen wisdome, knowledge, and reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to the man that is good, and to the sinner, affliction, &amp; su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous care. We haue alreadie treated suffitiently of the contempt of this world, as well on Gods behalfe as on our owne. Now then it shall not be amisse to speake thereof by regard of the world it selfe, the which if it be well considered, it conteineth in it selfe whereby to be contempned and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pised. And first this one thing commeth to memorie, that the louers of this world are tossed and retossed with sundry troubles, disquiettes, afflictions and labors, in such sorte that it ministreth more payne and bytternesse then delight and quietnesse in all things whereof men hope to haue consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For whilest they are withdrawen or turned back from the highest and most simple goodnesse, (in whom onely true peace, and true ioy doe abound) they disperse them selues in temporall and earthly things. And being not perfectly esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in any one thing, they are caryed about vniuersally. Whereby they are affected with manifolde passions and thoughtes, as now with delight, then with dollor, now with loue, then with hate, now with desire, then with disdayne, now with longing, and then with loathing. For they haue not the skill to bring things vnto an equall measure by the iudgement of reason and discretion, nor to be in a kynde of tranquilitie in euerie occurrent, but (lyke vnto bruit beastes) they follow the force and sway of their pangs and passions, accordyng to the impulsiue motion of their sensualities and lustes. Whereby it falleth out most commonly that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer continue long in one disposition. And besides these consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations (accordyng to the Philosophers opinion) a man which delighteth in contemplation and speculation, hath (in him selfe) sufficient matter and cause of good delight. Synce he is filled with speculation, and reioyseth in heauenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations, (that is to say) in scientiall and sapientiall points
<pb facs="tcp:3025:116"/>
of knowledge, in the which he is spiritually delighted. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doeth he séeke or require delightes in sensuall things out of him selfe. But the vnlearned, the carnall, and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men doe not taste any such delight, neither haue they sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely the matter or materiall cause of delight and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation within them selues. Therefore they séeke to reioyce in outward things wherein they stumble (not alwayes vpon pleasaunt and prosperous successe but) oftentimes vpon hard and ouerthwarte accydentes, which makes them most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to endure griefe and disquyet of mynde. And by good reason should that man which is deuout and spirituall, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne in him selfe wherewith to be spiritually delighted in God, yea euen in aduersitie. But the worldlings and the vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious men haue now wrath, then sadnesse, now enuy, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, &amp; sometymes sodayne feare (which be most paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and bitter passions) whereby they doe not onely wound and weaken their soule, but many tymes also they fret their mynde and waste their corporall strength. For somewhiles they are (as it were) resolued into vayne myrth, puffed vp with vayn hope, &amp; stretched out into vayn desures, &amp; straight wayes agayne they reioyce in that which ought to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sadde, and ware sorowfull for that which might giue them greater cause of comforte, gaping for that which were to bée s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

But the spirituall ryches (saith hée) are loathed when they are not yet had nor possessed, and that is of suche as haue not yet tryed them. Whych may peraduenture bee a cause (my welbeloued) that thou arte the lesse allured and entysed vnto the diuyne, sacred, and most sincere delyghtes of spirituall conuersation, and that thou makest the lesse haste therevntoo, bycause thou haste not (as I gesse) yet tryed them. But giue eare vnto thys holy father Gregorie, make haste, yea post hast, to attayne vnto a perfecte spyrytuall lyfe, leauyng the worlde and all the concupiscences thereof.</p>
               <p>And I hope that thou shalte taste howe swéete the Lorde is, for greate is the multitude of his delectablenesse.</p>

               <p>And to conclude, accordyng to the olde Prouerbe, who is so honoured, that hée is not sometymes troubled? who is in suche estymation, that hee is not also sometymes in trybulation? And who sitteth on hyghe that is not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte vnto vanytye.

               <p>And all thynges that héere doe excell, are more vexed with griefe then they are reioysed wyth honour, and more dooth the fall of dampnation threaten and affrighte them, then theyr hope to attayne euerlastyng blessednesse can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforte them.

but suche an one as feareth not Gods iudgement? it is a great securitie of mynde and quyet of conscience, to reteyne nothing that hath in it any seculer concupiscense. Yea and it is a vyle and miserable bondage, to be altogither troubled in worldly affayres, and to leaue God forgotten Although vnto many worldly men it seemeth gréeuous to be occupyed or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. So that the lesse it be occupyed and affected obout god, so muche the more it is powred out and bestowed in vayne and earthly things. Agayne Bernard sayeth: the insatiable loue of riches doth much more torment men with desire, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vse therof can recomfort them when they haue obteined it. For there is labor and payne in gettyng of them, feare and dread in possessing them, and much sorow and griefe in forgoing them. Yea golde doth most gréeue him which hath greatest aboundance thereof.

And let such reioyse in temporall things as haue not the skil to desire heauenly and euerlasting treasures.</p>
               <p>It is written in the holy word of God: Watche you (for<note place="margin">The losse of tyme or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spending of spirituall pro fits, enduce the contempt of the world.</note> you know not when the Lord commeth, ouer night, at myd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, or in the gray morning) least whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he commeth sodeyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he fynde you sléepyng.

And therevpon Chryst sayed: How hard it is<note place="margin">Mark. 10.</note> for them that are ryche to enter into the kingedome of God? For ryches being ones possessed, are very hardly des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pysed. And earthely thinges (beinge ones gotten) are more stryctly beloued, then they are coueted before they be had. So that they which altogither apply the multiplyinge of ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, doo neclect to séeke the ioyes of the worlde to come.</p>
               <p>And whyles they doo not medytate and déepely consider the soundenesse of eternitie, they loue and estéeme this banish<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>To conclude, how much more the louers of this world doo forgett GOD, euen so much the more also are they of him abandoned and forsaken, and so much the more theyr harts shalbe hardened. Wherevpon it oftentymes happeneth that they loue nothinge effectually which pertey<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

And whiles they neuer looke vp to sée from whence they be fallen, nor feare the punishmentes to come, they waxe ignoraunt how much they are to be lamented.</p>
               <p>For the more that they cleaue vnto vayne and euyll things, the lesse they acknowledge the good things which they haue lost.

But he which fyxeth his harte in things present, neuer weying nor consideryng the punyshmentes to come for the wicked, but is puffed vp with false ryches, and reioyseth when he hath more cause to be lamented, he is subiecte vnto many mischiefes. Synce there can be no truer nor ryghter my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie, then false and vayne tryumphyng. Yea and euerye man doeth so much the more outwardly reioyce, as hée doth inwardly the lesse remember him selfe. These sentences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alleaged I haue gathered out of Gregorie, wherby thou mayest playnely perceyue how perillous a thyng it is (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for suche as professe reformation) to apply our affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vnto these earthly things. But peraduenture thou doest purpose to vse ryches without abuse, and to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaunt amongest worldlyngs, but not worldly and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly, and to eate and drynke amongest them without ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otte or banquettyng. And fynally to vse the fauour and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of men without tryumphyng or glorying therein.</p>
               <p>Surely if thou couldest performe this, it were a great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. But hardly can the best and most perfect continue therein. And howe seldome it is séene, marke thy selfe by these wordes of Gregorius: It is commonly sée<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

For the bodie of the riche glutton is melted and dissolued into delightes, and hys hearte is opened vnto vayne ioye.

O how the Diuils doth reioyse to sée them all now in the synke and filthynesse of their sinnes. Men cleaue vnto worldly thinges, and in worldly thinges they are wyse, but they neyther care for God nor for his commaundementes, neyther are they asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed when they heare his moste terryble iudgementes.

Or suffer the wordes which he hath spoken of the iudgement to come and of the euerlasting paynes, to be falsified? God forbyd that we should so thynke. Furthermore whosoeuer is ouercome with the loue of earthly thinges, he is not delyghted in God. But no man can long abyde without some delectation.

And therefore such as are not delighted in spyrituall things, doe powre themselues out vnto worldly solace. And so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently are ouerwhelmed in the multytude of sinnes and vyces. Wherevpon Saint Augustine sayth: Blessed is he O Lord which loueth thée. For he which loueth not thee, loueth the world, is seruaunt and bounde vnto sinne, he is neuer quyet, neuer in safetie, but is dystracte and dyspersed in the varyable cares, vanityes, and pompes, of the world. And whosoeuer doth contempne the volupteousnesse of this world, and thereby eskaye the snares of the Diuill, shalbe most happy in that his soule is delighted in such thinges, as cannot be blotted or defiled with any vncleannesse, but is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately clensed &amp; purged with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cleannesse of truth.

But as longe as we delight in the deceyptfull tast of iniquity, so long we shall thinke it most sower and bytter to faste of equitie. And to whome the world séemeth swéete &amp; sauorye to him Christ séemeth bytter and sower. Yet hauing tasted the spyrite of God, all fleshe shall (as it were) dote and playe the foole. Agayne whosoeuer doeth with his whole mynde serue and please this world, is thereby enfected with a manyfold de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formytie of vyces.

Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it séemeth doubtfull that through seruyle feare and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayned fayth, his contrycion procéedeth by the onely beholdyng of his owne onely refuge. And that it is not true contrycion, but a terryfing of the spyrite. But he which will soundly and perfectly repent, must first be sorye for his faulte, bicause it is filthy transgression and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syue vnto GOD. Yea and a dyshonour vnto the diuine sanctitye and Maiestie. Wée reade in the Machabes: That Antyochus dyd repent, and yet obteyned not mercy. The Apostle doth wryte the lyke of Esau: He found not<note place="margin">2. Mac. 9.</note> (sayeth he) place for repentaunce, although he sought it wyth teares. Therefore let no man deceyue hymselfe<note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> wyth vayne hope or solyshe perswasyones. For as Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome sayeth: This I hold for certayne and doe thynke moste true, that hée hath no good ende which ledde alwayes an euyll lyfe.

in the vanityes of the world. The death of Saintes is most pretious in the sight of the Lorde, but the death of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners is most abhomynable. The sinner shalbe persecuted with this reuenge, that dying he shall forget himselfe, and both lyuing and dying he forgat God As. Augustine confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth saying: He cannot dye euill, which lyued well. Nay skarce can he dye well, which lyued euyll. And yet wée must not dispayre of any sinner. But they are to be exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and styred to repentaunce euen in the last gaspes. For some tymes percase it happeneth (although very seldome) that he which in tyme of health did neglect repentaunce, shall yet by repenting then obteyne mercy. But he is a most arogant foole which passinge ouer his lyse in health doth put his soules health vnto that ploonge of peryll. But let vs doe that which is more sure and sase. That is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and amende whyles we be sounde and in health, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing most faythfully with the Prophet: Cast me not out (O Lorde) in myne age, and leaue me not nor forsake me not,<note place="margin">Psal. 70.</note> when my strength and power fayle me.

                  </gap>yne essence or being is quod &amp; quo (that is to say) the very thing it selfe, &amp; the thing wherby all thinges are in this blessed vysion.</p>
               <p>Furthermore this vision is more then most worthy and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together supernaturall, the which all the chéefe Phyloso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers dyd thinke impossible to be put in any mynde created, no not in theyr separate substaunces. So that to obtayne the same, we haue néede of many supernaturall gyftes, meanes, and helpes,. As first that there may be geuen vs from God a blessing euen grace making vs gratefull and acceptable, the which doth bedecke and adorne perfectly the very essence or being of the intellectuall and reasonable nature. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs fyt to deserue eternall lyfe, and to be conioyned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the supernaturall diuinytie. Furthermore the loue and charytie whereby god &amp; the first being, or essence, is loued, is spirytually, supernaturally, purely, fréely, and fully distylled into vs from the holy Ghost. And with it, hope and fayth also. This charytie and loue doth (as it were) counterpayze him that hath it, with the loue of the whole vnyuersallitie. So that yet it maketh him loue God more then all thinges that euer were created. Yea the least dram of this loue and charytie doth make God to be loued aboue the whole world. And otherwyse man should not be in state of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
               <p>For according to the holy Fathers, whosoeuer hath thys charitie and the grace before rehearsed, he hath also the giftes of the holy ghost, and all the other vertues conuected vnto charytie and conioyned vnto perfect grace. Yea the more he profiteth in this grace and charytie, so much the higher doeth he growe in good gyftes and vertues.</p>
               <p>To conclude, the excelencie and worthynesse of these su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall good thinges is suche and so greate, that it can hardly be comprehended or expressed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3025:127"/>For no naturall perfection, no bewtie, no coomlynesse, nor no bryght shyninge lyght, can be thought equall vnto it. No the heauenly lyghts doo not so much, nor so well adorne and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>No the seuen Planettes doe not so muche adorne the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Spheres or Cyrcles, as the gyftes of the holy ghoste dooe adorne and bedecke the powers of the soule. The v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyuersallytie of the Starres dothe not so muche adorne and set foorth the eighth Sphere or Fyrmament, as the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersallytie of verteous actions dothe dignifie, adorne, and perfect, the Soule. For euen as by the Philosophers opinion, true felicitie consisteth rather in action, then in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde forme, euen so in diuinitie also more vertue and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection consisteth in exercise of godly actions, then in profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or aparaunce. And the more noble that the outwarde aparaunce be, the more noble should the action and execucion be also. Therefore since the forenamed gyftes and treasures of grace, be habytes or outward tokens of so great highnes and excelence, doth not the christian soule séeme vnto thée to be most noble, gallaunt, and godlyke, which is occupyed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in the exercyse of those habytes, and which is so spiritually, supernaturally, and godly conuersant? yea which doth so perfectly worship and reuerence God, whose conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacion is altogether in heauen? For surely here vpon it hath bene wrytten, that such a soule: is the daughter, the beloued, and the spowse of God, priuie to his heauenly secretes, most familiar with him, conformable in affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and the entyrely beloued heyre of God, the coheyre with Christ, which behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding gods glory with face dyscouered, is tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sformed into the same likenesse, from one brightnes to another.

<pb facs="tcp:3025:127"/>
God. But whatsoeuer it knoweth may please God, that doth it with all earnest affection embrase. To conclude, euen as by the Philosophers traditions euery motion hath his dignitie, name, &amp; prospertie from the ende wherevnto it tendeth, euen<note place="margin">Terminus ad qué.</note> so the action is dignified by the worthinesse of the obiect and matter about the which it is occupyed.

And to the ende thou mayest the more earnestly couet the same, I wyll say some what of the vylenesse, peruersenesse, and deformitie, of the sinfull soule. The which beinge by deadly sinne turned and withdrawen from God, is spiritually deade, and doth nothing acceptable vnto God, nor profitable towardes the atteyninge of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting lyfe. It preferreth these transitorie, sensible, worldly, &amp; most vile things which seeme good, before y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> highest, eternal, most perfect, infinite, &amp; vnchangeable true God, beinge omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, and more then most glorious aboue all other. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it doth highly dishonor God. Yea it proposeth vnto it selfe an ende and terminacion in frayle and vayne thinges. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it fynally rest in the creator, but is altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to him, caring not at al to cleaue vnto him, to be sub iect vnto him, nor to obey him. It is made like vnto the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked spirits, attended with vices, hateful to god, dispised of his angels, &amp; vncessantly doth wound, hurt, defile, &amp; make it selfe damnable. For y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> more that any man be delighted in earthly, transitory, and carnal things, the more wickedly &amp; vylely he liueth, and the more vnhappy he is.

carefull to obey God, and to giue him his due reuerence in all thinges. To conclude we are chiefely lykened vnto god by vertuous actions, and holy affections vnto diuyne cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rytie. But by p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ges, vanyties, and vyces, we are made most vnlyke vnto him. For simylitude and lykenesse are cause of loue, as dissimilytude and vnlykenesse are cause of rancor and hatred. Yea the perfection of any creature (especially of a reasonable and intellectuall mynde) is to be proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately made lyke vnto his creator. Then the more lofty that we become through vertue, so much the lyker and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beloued we are vnto God. Yea so much the fayrer and more comely we are inwardly adorned. But the more that we sinne, the more vnlyke, odyble, and ilfauored we séeme vnto our God. Which out of all doubt is a most myserable and vnworthy thing. Therefore we sée there is greate dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwene y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vertuous and vytious soules. And as by the Phylosophers opinion, a man which spendeth his tyme in contemplation is most pleasing vnto the gods, euen so by the same doctryne, a man which giueth himselfe vnto vyces, and naughtynesse, is tenne thousand tymes more abhomynable then the brute Beastes. As may also playne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare by the diuersitie of theyr rewards. For god doth place and constytute the vertuous, in the firie heauen, giuing himselfe vnto him for reward, &amp; communicating all thinges vnto him by an immediate &amp; most blessed kinde of vnion with him himselfe. But he dothe put from him the vycious for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore, delyuereth him ouer vnto wickyd spirites, placeth him in hell, and iudgeth him to euerlasting paynes. Iudge and discerne therefore betwene these two (my welbeloued) and chuse and obserue that which séemeth best vnto thée. Doo not so embase and make thy selfe vyle, that thou become a bondman to sinne &amp; to the diuill. Do some little thing for the loue of god. And do not thou neglect y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dignities, holines, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynesse, &amp; godlynes, before rehearsed, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rytches, delightes, and honours of this most shorte and vncertayne lyfe. But lyue before the highest God, fearefully and waryly.

Furthermore, if thou doo well consider how the sonne of God for thy sake was hanged vpon the crosse, with his armes stretched out, how for thy sake he was mocked and taunted in a white and purple garment, nay rather, how he was strypped naked, and naked raysed vp on the crosse, and there sundry wayes derided and mocked.

Now it is certeyne that temporall thinges are directed, and ordered, vnto, and by the spirituall thinges, as vnto theyr ende and onely skope. But thend and terminable skope is loued and desyred one waye and the meanes and degrées whereby we atteyne to the ende, are loue &amp; desyred another way. For the ende is of it selfe &amp; by it selfe to be desyred &amp; loued. As (for example) health, in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie of Phisicke. But the meanes and degrées to attayne vnto thinges, are to be desyred and loued, in that they are profitable or auaileable to the attayning of the ende or skope which we séeke to gett. That is to saye, that by them the ende may the more conueuiently be obteyned. Then let the case be this, that ryches are finally ordeyned for the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all proceding &amp; profit of our soules. And therewithall ioyne that the profit and perfection of our soules doth concist in the action of vertue. That is to saye, essencially in the actes of faythe, charitie, and wysedome, (meaning the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placion and loue of diuine thinges) and dystributiuely in the actions of the morall vertues.</p>
               <p>Then shall we fynde that ryches are so much to be thought lawefull, so much to be desyred, and so much to be loued, as they are profitable and necessary for the sustentacion and sobre nourishment of our bodies, and for the néedefull and decent clothing of our membres. By the which vse the soule is made apt for the actes of contemplacion and diuine loue.</p>
               <p>But if they be further desyred, then fall we truely into couetousnesse, which is an vnordinate appetyte and desyre to temporal thinges and vanities.

sorte of sinnes and offences. Whereby all grace &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie is taken away, and the sinner doth spiritually dye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, vnlesse he conuerte vnto the feare of God. Whereby it appeareth consequently, that he shall hardlye eschue and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde these gréeuous and greatest offences, which doeth not dayly accustome him selfe to eschue the least faults &amp; trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions.

Yea they take away the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentnesse of charitie, and doe hynder and let the increase of grace in vs. Wherevpon the holy fathers affyrme: He that is negligent in small things, doth by a little and a little fall and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

For otherwyse thy fruites are deade before the face of God. Whose voice whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the shéepe heareth not, he strayeth and wandereth. Now it is a gréeuous sinne and offence more to cleaue and stick vnto, to be more deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and affected, in the create, frayle, and vayn things of this world, then God him selfe. Whervpon Hierome sayeth: A mynd dedicated vnto God should as well beware of the least as of the greatest offences. Knowing that accompt must bée rendered of euery idle word. And therefore Gregorie sayth: He that taketh not héede of the least, falleth into the greatest offences. Then such as doe dayly follow vanities, laughyng, bablyng, sportyng, dallying, wandring here and there, and accustomyng them selues to all lightnesse, and in the meane whyle doe very seldome or neuer repent or amend, how can they choose but become culpable also of greater enormities?

And by whose god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aduyce, he may be instructed, kindled by his exhortations, and helped by his assistant prayers. For the frendship of such being founded on godlinesse and honestie, is of great force and efficacye before God. Wherevpon the auntient fathers sayde: that the fraudes and temptations of the diuill are by no worldly meanes more repulsed nor defended, then by the socyetie of a zealous friende vnto whom a man may laye open his harte and mynde. Least the power of the diuil being secretly shutte therein, doe infecte and vtterly distroy it. And therevpon it is written: A faythfull friend is a strong<note place="margin">Eccle. 6.</note> protection. And he which hath founde such an one, hath a great treasure. There is no comparison to a faythful friend, neyther can the weight of Gold nor siluer counterpeyse hys fayth. A faythfull friend is a medicyne of lyfe and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie, and suche as feare the Lorde shall fynde suche friendes.</p>
               <p>And in another place hee sayeth: Blessed is hee which fyndeth a faythfull friende. For since man is naturally a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing creature which defireth company, it is naturall (say the<note place="margin">Eccle. 35.</note> Philosophers) that he should be helped. And since man is not a good iudge ouer him selfe, it is expedyent that hee open his griefe and conscyence to some other more méete to iudge thereof. Therefore harken vnto counsell, and bee not ruled by thyne owne sensuall appetyte. But endeuour thy selfe to eschue all familyaritie &amp; societie of wanton worldlings, for that is greatly hurtfull to thy soule.</p>
               <p>God is a spirite (as it is written in the fourth Chapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note place="margin">It is good to pray and sing Psalmes.</note> of John) and they which worship him must worshipp<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

                  <pb facs="tcp:3025:133"/>
yet those actions of vertues which are immedyately (and without any interim) done and exercysed about God, ought to be done and exercysed with a greater reuerence and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular zeale. Now prayer, singing of Psalmes, and adminy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string of sacramentes are actions of vertue pertayning vnto Gods honor. And therefore they are to be executed with all diligence and perfection. Wherevnto first is requyred the obseruation and kéeping of the diuyne prec<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

And agayn: Cursed are they which declyne from thy commaundements. Therfore first the conuersation must be made conformable vnto the prayer, and nexte the harte must be vnyted vnto God by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten proofe and continuall attentyuenesse. For of suche as are backewarde and doe not attende, the Lorde spake by Esaye<note place="margin">Esai. 29.</note> saying: This people honoreth me with their lippes, but their harte is farre from mée. And the wyse man sayde: Before<note place="margin">Eccle. 18.</note> prayer, prepare thyne harte and soule, and be not lyke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a man which tempteth God.

               <p>Furthermore, for as much as there are thrée sundry effects in prayer, (that is) acceptation with God, obtayning of that we craue, and a certayne swéete refection of mynde which be féeleth that prayeth, the before named attentiuenesse shal be sufficient to the former two of these affectes. But vnto the third, there is requisite a continuall and mightie attentyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. For according to Basilles wordes. Euen as the taste of the mouth doth discerne and taste euerie morsell or péece of the bodily sustenaunce, whilest it cheweth and gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, euen so the inwarde taste of the soule oughte in prayer and singyng of Psalmes to marke and taste the sence of euerye worde and sentence. And that
<pb facs="tcp:3025:134"/>
the forenamed actions and dueties may be perfectly dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and executed, there is required a great warynesse and watchfulnesse of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> nor payne comparable vnto hartie prayer. But such prayer and singing of Psalmes is of great (and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedyng great) efficatie towardes the obtayning at Gods handes of all things which we doe healthfully requyre. And there vpon Christ sayd: True worshippers and prayers, shal worship and pray to the father in spirit and veritie. And Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sille sayeth: the diuyne helpe is to be craued, not <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ackly, nor with a mynde wandring here and there, for suche an one shall not onely fayle to obtayne, but further shall styrre and prouoke God to anger. For it is requisite in tyme of prayer to behaue our selues purely, and stoutly. Stoutly, that wée may reuerently and ioyfully attend the Lord our God. Not sloughfally nor sléepily gaping and yawning, neither whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peryng and muttering, and cutting of our words in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest, but with a stout and couragious sounde (as best becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth) let vs pronounce our desires before the holy Ghost. Then purely also, that we thinke vpon none other thing but the Psalme or prayer which wée sing or say. For the holye ghost will not acceptably receyue that which is profered, if we neglecte that which is due vnto him. And pray not nor sing not ouer hastily. In praying and singing of Psalms we haue two especiall things to marke and attend. That is our owne myserie, and Gods mercie. To the ende that by the consideration of our owne myserie, imperfection, frayltie, and malice, we may be prouoked vnto true humilitie. And by the consideration of Gods mercy, goodnesse, and loue, we may be induced to a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Yea and that wée may desire to please God onely, and bee more delighted in the sence, then in the gallantnesse of the wordes, and more in deuotion, then in warblyng with the

Plato sayeth: It is not the parte of a Philosopher to studie about the pleasures &amp; delightes of meat, drinke, &amp; venerie. A Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher doth think it dishonor to be brauely apparelled or dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, &amp; is content with suche clothing as may serue his neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie vse. A Philosophers intention is not about y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body, but furthest from it, and is wholly occupyed about consideration of the soule. The mynde and soule of the Phylosopher doth dispise and disdayne the bodye, and flyeth from it, that it selfe may bee wholly occupyed in and about it se<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>fe. For out of our bodyes procéede thousandes of impediments vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to contemplation, whilest we are busied for the necessarie su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentation therof. A Philosophers meditation, is the loosyng and separation of the mynd from the bodie. It is a rediculous thyng for a man that all his lyfe tyme dyd prepare hym selfe vnto death, if then when it commeth, hée bée trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled or molested therewith. If thou perceyue any man to shrynke at death when it commeth, say boldlye hée was no Phylosopher. As often as the mynde or soule is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured by the bodye vnto these worldely and chaungeable thynges, it is seduced and sore troubled. But as often as the mynde or soule is exercysed by it selfe in speculation, it is straight wayes transferred into sinceritie and immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</p>
               <p>The bodie and the mynde beyng both in one, nature <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> yet commaund the bodie to be gouerned, to serue, and to bée subiecte. But it commaundeth the mynde or soule to rule and beare dominion. True Philosophers doe abstayne from all things that are corporal, &amp; are not gréedy louers of mony and riches. These sentences Plato affirmed. Now Socrates (by Saint Hieromes testimony) dyd vtterly contempne ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Dyogenes forsaking all these worldly pompes, dyd chuse to lyue in hys Tunne. Tullye and Seneca haue <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

ryches and voluptuousnesse. Then if these men being one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enduced by naturall reason, and onely for the attayning of naturall felicitie and scyence, did thus contempne all vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ledde such a strickt and hard lyfe, of how great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnation are Christians culpable, which being instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the doctryne of the gospell and very lawe of God, to whom the onely begotten sonne of God him self did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally come, and made him selfe an example for them, are not yet ashamed to lead a wanton, vayne, and delycate lyfe, are blotted and blemished with carnall markes, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Salomon in the xxix. of his Prouerbes sayeth: Our<note place="margin">Of the vanitie &amp; wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of this present lyfe.</note> dayes are as woundes vpon the earth, and yet there is no death. And Augustine in his thirtenth booke and tenth Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter De ciuitate dei, sayeth: From the tyme that any man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynneth to be in this mortall bodye, hee doeth incessauntly trauayle to dye. For therevnto tendeth all his mutabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in all hys lyfe (if it may bee called lyfe) that hee ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to that ende that death may come. For all men are néerer vnto death after a yeare finished, then they were before it begonne, to morrowe, then to day, to daye, then yesterday, and euen anon, then now.</p>
               <p>For all the while we lyue, some little space of our lyfe is taken away. And that which remayneth doth dayly become lesse and lesse. So that the whole course of this our lyfe, is nothyng els but a recourse vnto death. And in this course no man is suffred to stay nor to linger and goe softelyer then his fellowes. But all men are drouen on with equal steps and paces, and are all conceyued alyke to their ende. Neyther doeth he which dyeth soonest, passe ouer the day faster then an other whose lyfe lasted longer. But hauyng eche of them equall momentes and tymes to passe ouer equallye, that one had hys ende and determinate tyme set nearer, and that other further of.</p>
               <p>For it is one thing to haue lyued longer, and another thyng to haue gone or procéeded slower or quicker.</p>
               <p>And therfore whosoeuer doth the longer linger his dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he dye, he went notwithstanding neuer the more slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but he had the longer iourney to performe. Yea and if it should be accompted that a man doth begin to dye (I meane to bee dead in déede) from the fyrst moment that death clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med hys ryghte in thys our exyle, (whych is euen from
<pb facs="tcp:3025:137"/>
our swadlyng clontes) then all this lingryng and detrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of tyme, should in accoumpt be no tyme at all. For what other thyng doe we accomplysh in our dayes, houres, momentes, and tymes, then that thys lyfe beyng consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, death (which all that whyle was in hande) may bée fulfilled. Of these things Augustyne speaketh largely in the Chapiter before rehearsed, and the Chapiter next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. But of the infinyte euilles and myseries of thys present lyfe, he treateth more playnely in hys xx. booke and xx. Chapiter of the same worke saying: As touching our first originall beginnyng, all mankynde was in damnable estate as well witnesseth thys our lyfe (if it bée a lyfe) so full of such and so excéedyng great euilles. For what els betokeneth the horrible depth of our ignorance, from whence all errour spryngeth? the which dyd receyue all Adams chyldren into a darkesome corner, so that a man can not from it bée delyuered without payne, sorowe, and dread? yea the inordynate loue which we beare to so many thynges giltye of vanitie, whereon so many cares doe ryst, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perturbations, so many languyshings, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

Furthermore, Augustine in his booke entituled De miseria mundi, doth plainly treat saying: Take héed to thy self least being wrapped in the snares of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuill, thou become a pray to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter which ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth and séeketh whom he may deuour.

So that beyng vnable to hold it vp falling, we fall with it percompany. Yea is not this our lyfe lyke vnto death, since therin doe abound so many dolors, lamentations, sighes, and so great miseries? one man being gréeued w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> loffe cryeth out. Another co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually bewayleth the barenesse of his ground.

Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is growen a little, he beginneth to hunger, thirst, &amp; to bée weary. To conclude, man hath alwayes two sundry torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts which (by turnes) doe vexe him continually. The which are: feare &amp; sorow. If A man be well, he feareth, &amp; if he be euil at ease he soroweth. What is he whom the prosperitie of thys world hath not deceiued? Or who is it y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hath not ben gréeued with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> aduersitie therof? the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> behold man what great afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thou doest suffer in this world, which thou so much este<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest. Wherin (in very déed) there are nothing but false &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiptful voluptuousnes, &amp; true (yea vndoubted) calamitie. No safetie of myrth and ioye, but a tormentyng feare, a gréedie couetousnesse, and a fruitlesse lamentation. And who is he which can number or accoumpt all the euilles and discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of this lyfe? For to ouerpasse with scilence those euilles which doe commonly oppresse all men (that is to say secret sorowes, and especiall griefes whereof all men may fynde them selues giltie) let a man but call to mynde what euylles hee hath both sustayned and committed from hys youth vpwardes, let him but set before hys eyes the tymes passed, and diligently consider howe many vayne labours he hath vndertake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, how often he hath swet in vain for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue of this wretched world.</p>
               <p>How often he hath founde deceyptfull issues of hys most earneste trauayles, and let hym then ponder that after
<pb facs="tcp:3025:138"/>
long troubles he hath yet obteyned no rest, and he shal quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know what accoumpt is to be made of this world.</p>
               <p>O myserable man then what doest thou, or whether goest thou? whiles thou art in this world, thou doest but iust and roonne in a Tyltyearde. Wherein thou findest an enemie which is to strong for thée, whome thou neyther canst sée nor yet eskape from him. He entyseth thée with tryflyng toyes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereby to robbe and despoyle thée of the ioyes of heauen.</p>
               <p>Yea and thereby to put into thée, the very tormentes of hell. His lackye lyeth close hidden in the way, couered with earth which is the diuells concubyne and lenunan. The enimy of mankynde doth behold the manners and naturall enclynaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of euery man, and vnto what vyce they be most prone, &amp; those he setteth before theyr faces, which may most aptly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure and betray theyr myndes. And whiles he maketh them gaze at the gaynes of glystryng gold, they neuer sée the perill of theyr perdicion, but lyke fooles being deceiued with the delightes, which they sée and carnally doe loue, they neuer marke how they fall hedlong into damnacion. And bicause all men are voyde of vnderstandinge, they perishe perpetually. Wherefore if the world doe please and delight thée, beware the deceyptfulnesse thereof. Remember that as Salomon<note place="margin">Iacob. 14.</note> sayeth: Lamentacion and dolor doo come in the ende of ioyes and merymentes. For all mans pleasantnesse is bytter and sowre in the ende. When a man reioyseth in the world be reioyseth not in God.</p>
               <p>But yet alas how many ther be which reioyse in the world, &amp; neuer reioyse in God? To reioyse in the worlde, is to boast, tryumphe, and glory, in iniquitie, vanitie, ryches, honor, outwarde coomlynesse, fylthy conuersacion, &amp; vayne pastimes with vnfreutefull and leuds communicacion. Which is in effecte, to purchase sorowe and lamentacion. For no man can embrace Christ and the world bothe attones. Many men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing Christ, doe prayse him, loue him, and rendre thanckes vnto him whiles they be in theyr worldly prosperitie. But if aduersitie light vpon them they cursse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; blaspheme him.
<pb facs="tcp:3025:139"/>
Such men serue god for profit and not for loue. Unto whom the Lord God may iustly saye: For your owne benefit and commoditie you haue obserued my commaundementes, and not bicause you loued me with a pure entent. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doest thou extoll thy selfe in vanitie (O man) is not thy body (as the Preacher sayth) dust and asshes? Art not thou<note place="margin">Eccle. 10.</note> thy selfe of earth, and shalt soone be resolued againe into earth? Looke into the Sepulchres of the greatest Prices, and sée if any other thing doe there remayne but bones and dust?

Sainct Augustine dothe moste deuoutely propounde in his bookes before named. And finally he wryteth in a certeyne Sermon saying: Attende and marke, O myserable Soule of sinfull Man, that horryble houre in which thou shalt depart from the body.

And if that knowledge be worth the learning, whereof commeth certeyne and great commoditie, none can be compared with the Scyence of well dying, the fruite whereof is comfort, and lyfe neuer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3025:140"/>And as this knowledge is most perfect &amp; worthie learninge, so haue you taken a verye méete and conuenient tyme for the atteyninge of it, which is youth the flower of your age, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it selfe strengthe and habilitie to learne any Scyence, and leauing tyme to practise that is well learned. For as none other science profitable (being lyberall) is sodenly lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, neither is it enough to byd a man though he be wytty, sodenly to drawe a figure in Geometrie, make a proporcion by Arithmiticke, be a good sowldier, ingenier or other lyke, (for he may say he lacketh tyme, teaching, and exercise to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne such knowledge,) euen so is the science of dying wel, to be learnid with tyme, meditacion, and exercise. And who so sayth to a sicke man not practised herein, be content to dye, &amp; forgo this mortal life, may here of him againe I know, what it is to lyue by experience, but to dye I haue not learned, and the lesson is not so easie as you thinke it.

            <p>And now somewhat to satisfie your desyre, and to entre into this treatie, which I entende not to make longe, I wyl kéepe this ordre, Fyrst to shew that vnto a Christian man, Death is not to be fledde, but rather to be desyred, or at the least well to be taken, no plague, but <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

And thirdly tell how those lettes may be remoued, and our opinion somewhat changed, to thincke of Death and lyfe as they are without preiudice that men commonly bringe with them. To the heathen not knowing GOD, nor the vertue of the lyfe to come, the first parte, that Death is not to be fledde, shonnid, and terrible, is a lesson harde, or rather vnposs<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

<pb facs="tcp:3025:142"/>
and that not onely men, in whome naturally courage is, but women and children, whose weake sexe and tender age de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared more playnely what true and hartie loue is able to worke, which as it brought Christ downe from heauen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to earth, so being truely rooted in man it is able to draw him from earth into heauen, without respect had to him selfe, or any thing that is his.</p>
            <p>And thus much spoken of the first parte doth now make the waye open to bring in the second, for it may be sayde, if there be any meanes to take away the feare of Death, and diminish the desire of lyfe, who should atteyne to the same so soone as christian men. And sith we be all of that number, howe commeth it then to passe that so fewe are contented to dye, and many so affrayde thereof, that neither them selues will thinke of it, nor willingly heare other speake of it. To the which question, although I might in fewe woordes aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, and say that there lacketh in vs that lyuely and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect loue of God and the lyfe to come, which should be in vs and was in them of whome I spake. Yet to make this point more playne (for it is lesse to saye all then to touche eache parte of all) I finde thrée causes especiall that make men desirous to liue and lothe to dye.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The one is our weakenesse which séemeth to haue some excuse, bicause nature desireth the conceruacion of it selfe, &amp; abhorreth dissolucion which both taketh away our being, and also bringeth with it great gréefe and paynes, which men sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in other and flying in them selfe, feare Deathe, whose seruants and messengers they are.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The second cause is, either the lacke or the small quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of fayth in vs, whereby we beleue not, or fayntly beleue the meruailous promises of incomparable blysse promised by GOD vnto his faythfull, after this transitory and present lyfe.</p>
            <p n="3">3 But the greatest cause is the third, which is a loue and swéetenesse conceaued of this lyfe, the goods and commody<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the same, wherewith who so is possessed, it can not
<pb facs="tcp:3025:142"/>
be auoided, but vnto him the very reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of death which taketh fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him that he loueth, must be sower &amp; bitter, as the scripture saith. To say somewhat to these thrée things which maketh lyfe swéet &amp; death sower, is the third part of my mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which I promised to entreate of.</p>
            <p>And for the first, which is a naturall weaknes inge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dering of it selfe the feare of death, we can not say it hath no power in vs mortal men, sith Christ our patron being more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man confessed to haue some féeling of it in him selfe. But if we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was weak to make vs strong, who gaue the onset, &amp; made the conquest of death &amp; weaknes, &amp; that not for him selfe, but for vs, &amp; in our nature, saying afterwarde to vs, be bolde &amp; feare not, I haue made a conquest of the world, And y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he hath by taking on him our nature, meruelously ioyned &amp; incorporated vs vnto him, so that by grace &amp; participacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is true in vs, which by perfection of nature was true in him, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fynde we that this weaknes remayneth not as before in his force, but is inforced &amp; cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teruayled by a stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth geuen vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides our selues, which bicause we should firmely beleue, not to be imagined or onely in words, but true &amp; in déedes, God hath shewed it by the example of thousandes of his martirs, not flying as before is said, but desiring death, not fearing but conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning it, triumphing in torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quering in weakenes, not saying, sad &amp; heauie is myne hart vntil death be past, but I desire to be in the féeling to begin to lyue, swéete is the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, colde is the fire, dul is the axe, for what is ther in death dreadful vnto a faythfull &amp; christian man, is it the dissolucion of the bodie? that a christian man desireth? who is able to say I long to be dissolued: is it that death bringeth an ende of life &amp; being heare? that is not much to him that knoweth he hath an other lyfe to come, in comparison of which this is no lyfe but death, no ioy but sorow, no ease but trauayle, no quiet but misery. So that either there is in deade very smal &amp; weake faith in vs to beleue gods promises infallibly made to all his. Or if we doo assuredly beleue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the greatest feare in that behalfe is past, for he that loseth his lyfe temporall, fyndeth
<pb facs="tcp:3025:143"/>
eternal, goeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> labour to rest, from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sea into the hauen, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> weaknes to strength, from sicknes to health, from death to lyfe, from sinne to iustice, from sorow, heuines, &amp; paine, to the place where there is no gréefe nor sighinge, those former parts are then past. Let the heathen feare to dye, who may truely say, I know not whether I goe, nor what is ordeyned for me, to what ende the gods haue created me, whether it be good or no, who are borne in sin, &amp; not new borne in holines, who haue neither teaching or knowledge of life, neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis of the same. But a christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man being taught y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> death is the entre to lyfe, that he is ordeyned to lyue with Christ, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to be partaker of his glory, regenerat &amp; sanctified by him with promis of blisse inestimable, if he after all this retorne to the same loue of lyfe &amp; feare of death y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gentil, what doth he then else, but practise to be come a gentil &amp; heathen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, selling away his enherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce for lesse then a messe of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cing his priuiledge whervnto he is singularly and especially called.</p>
            <p>But as we haue sayd before, weaknes may be a great cause to make a man feare death, &amp; lack of beléefe a greater, but yet are they not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greatest, for perfect loue ouerco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth weaknes increaseth &amp; reuiueth faith, wher loue is whole &amp; sounde, the rest is soone recouered, if it be lost, or increased if it be decat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But if loue be either deuided betwene god &amp; this world &amp; lyfe present, or wholly tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god vnto things tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, How should a man be content to parte fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he loueth, and séeke that he careth not for, sithe it is so true, saying, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> where the man loueth, he lyueth, and vnpossible is it, that who so is delited here &amp; possessed with the loue of this lyfe, should wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly heare of death, which can onely be welcome to them, that therby desire to be with Christ, whom they loue better then the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues or this lyfe, &amp; so can be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to leaue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better, their welbeloued for the best beloued, or y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they estéeme light they entirely and tenderly loue: For if it be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked what is the thing of such force y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is able to make a man content to forsake his goods, his liuing, him selfe and his life if we will answere truely and in fewe words, we must say

            <p>Sith the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loue is of such force, as y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> same is able to bereue a man not only of his goods &amp; treasure, but also of his lyfe and that by his owne will and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent, the right waye to learne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentidly to receaue death when god sendeth it, is to learne to employ wel &amp; fasten our loue wher it should be &amp; is due, that is vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god, and the lyfe to come, louing that onely for it selfe, and other things so much and so farre, as we neither change nor remoue y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> out of his place, which lesson if it be not onely beleued but practised, maketh the lyfe godly and comfortable, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death easy.

            <p>Isaac byd his sonne go hunt, prouide &amp; gett him meat, that he might blesse him before he dyed. The lycke co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in Iacob, Tobias, Dauid, &amp; sundry other whome we finde not onely neuer to haue shunned death, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentedly to haue receaued it. The loue they bare vnto God &amp; his will in their lyfe, kept the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from disorderid loue of the world, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon sinnes &amp; vices, which men for worldly thinges co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit, &amp; being not troubled with conscience &amp; remorce therof, sawe no cause to shunne &amp; to feare death. And as this loue of god, &amp; his wil, encreased in the new testament, where the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghost, the spirit of loue, was &amp; is more ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiously powred in to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> harts of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right beleui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g.
