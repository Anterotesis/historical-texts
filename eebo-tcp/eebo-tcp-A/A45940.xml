            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Alſo the Right Honourable the Houſe of Peers, were pleaſed on the 10<hi>th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> 1678, to paſs a Bill for the confirming the ſaid Letters Patents; but that Seſſion ended before the ſaid Bill was read in the Houſe of Commons.</p>
            <p>Whereupon many of the Creditors of the Goldſmiths (amongſt others, the Plaintiff Mr. <hi>Williamſon</hi>) deliver'd up their Securities for their Debts to the Goldſmiths, and the Plaintiff accepted of an Aſſignment from <hi>Vyner,</hi> in lieu of his 1000 <hi>l.</hi> Debt, purſuant to the ſaid Letters Patents, of a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable part of the Annual Sums ſo granted; and which Sums were accordingly paid in the Reigns of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and the late King <hi>James</hi> the Second, to <hi>Lady-day</hi> 1683.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1683"/> And in regard no Tallies or Monies could afterwards be obtained, upon due and repeated Application for that purpoſe,</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1689"/> The Plaintiff Mr. <hi>Williamſon,</hi> in <hi>Hillary Term,</hi> 1689, did commence his Suit in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> by way of <hi>Monſtrans de droit,</hi> (as had formerly been very often practiced) thereby ſetting forth his Title as Aſſignee under Sir <hi>Robert Vyner</hi> to the ſaid 60 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> (being his proportionable part of the ſaid Annual Sum ſo granted by the ſaid Letters Patents) and prayed that the Arrears thereof might be paid unto him; and that the future growing Sums might alſo be paid according to the ſaid Letters Patents</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1690"/> Unto which Suit the then Attorney General (now Lord Chief Juſtice of the Common Pleas) had ſeveral Days and Terms given him to plead, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, as he ſhould think beſt for the Crown; and at laſt a Demur being by him put in thereunto;</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1691"/> The Cauſe had a long Agitation, and was argued for about two years, by the then Mr. Attorney, Mr. Solicitor, and others of the King's Council for the Crown, and alſo by Council for the Plaintiff, Mr. <hi>Williamſon</hi>; and the Court after long deliberation, and view of the Precedents and Book Caſes, produced and cited on both ſides, in <hi>Hillary Term,</hi> 1691, gave Judgment for the Plaintiff, That the Letters Patents were good, and bound the Revenue; and that the Plaintiff ought to be paid the Arrears of the ſaid 60 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> and the growing Duty for the future.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the then Attorney General on the behalf of His Majeſty, brought a Writ of Error, Returnable before the then Commiſſioners of the Great Seal, who thereupon Ordered all the Judges to be attended with Copies of the Proceedings, and that they ſhould give their Aſſiſtance at the Argument of the Cauſe: And after the Cauſe had been long and many times Argued by Council at the Bar, at laſt the Judges Aſſiſtants, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and ſolemnly Argued the ſame, and were all of Opinion, (except the Lord Chief Juſtice of the Common Pleas) That the Letters Patents were good in Law, and that the Plaintiff had a good Title; and that the Judgment given in the Exchequer was good, and ought to be affirmed; And that the Plaintiff Mr. <hi>Williamſon</hi> ought to be Paid his Arrears, and the future Duty according to the ſaid Letters Patents and Judgment. But the Lord Chief Juſtice of the Common Pleas was of opinion that although the Grant or Letters Patents were good in Law, yet that the Plaintiff had not taken a proper Remedy, and that the Court of Exchequer had no Juriſdiction in this Cauſe. And the Right Honourable the then Lord Keeper, (now Lord Chancellor) having publickly Argued the ſaid Cauſe, and being of the ſame opinion, as to the Juriſdiction of the Court,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1696"/> for that and ſeveral other Reaſons offered by his Lordſhip, was pleaſed to Reverſe the Judgment.</p>
            <p>Upon which Judgment of Reverſal, the Plaintiff Mr. <hi>Williamſon</hi> hath brought this Writ of Error in the Houſe of Lords, and humbly hopes their Lordſhips will be pleas'd to Reverſe the Judgment given by the Lord Chancellor, and affirm the Judgment given for the Plaintiff in the Court of Exchequer. Conſidering,</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. That the Plaintiff is a Purchaſer upon a full and valuable Conſideration from Sir <hi>Robert Vyner</hi> the Patentee, having delivered up the Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he had for his Debt, and accepted the 60 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> in lieu thereof.</item>
               <item>II. That the Court of Exchequer (who are always exceeding careful of the Revenue, and the King's Intereſt, being more immediately bound thereunto by their Oaths, then the reſt of the Judges are) upon mature and great deliberation, and ſearch and view of many ancient Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, did ſolemnly Adjudge and Declare the Law to be, That the Letters Patents were good, and that the Plaintiff had taken a proper Remedy, and ought to be Paid his Annuity, and the Arrears thereof.</item>
               <item>III. That all the Judges called to the Lord Chancellors Aſſiſtance (except the Lord Chief Juſtice of the Common Pleas) upon ſeveral Days ſolemn Arguments and Debate, gave their opinions for the Plaintiff, in affirmance of the Judgment in the Exchequer; and that the ſaid Letters Patents were good, and ought to be complied with, in Paying the ſaid Annuity; and that the Plaintiff had taken a proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to Recover the ſame.</item>
               <item>IV. Even the opinion of the Lord Chief Juſtice of the Common Pleas was, (as is humbly conceived) that the Grant and Letters Patents were good, and Conveyed a Legal Right and Title to the Patentee, yet that this Right was without a Remedy, for that the Court of Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer had no Power over the King's Money, when it was brought into the Receipt, their Power being over it, as was Alledged, <hi>in Tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu,</hi> before Paid in, and only to enforce the Payment thereof; when as a Right and Title without a Remedy, (and no other Legal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy was pretended to be pointed out to the Plaintiff) ſeems contrary to all Laws, and to the Rules of Juſtice and Reaſon. And indeed it would be a hard thing to ſay that the Court of Exchequer can Relieve the King againſt the Subject, and not Help and Relieve the Subject, when he produces a Legal Title againſt the King. This hath not been the Practice of that Court, for near the laſt 200 Years.</item>
               <item>V. The Objections ſo much inſiſted upon, That the Lord Treaſurer is Superior to the Barons, and therefore not to be commanded by them, to Pay Moneys; And that in caſe the Barons can diſpoſe of the King's Money, it may weaken and prevent the Publick Security, when the Neceſſities of the State require it to be otherwiſe Imployed; are thus Anſwered, That although the Lord Treaſurer is a greater Perſon, yet he and all the Subjects are inferior to the King's Courts. That the Barons ſend this Command, as they are a Court of Juſtice, and in the name of the King himſelf; ſo that it is the King by His Writs, and not the Barons, that Command the Lord Treaſurer in this Caſe: The Barons have no Power to diſpoſe of the King's Money, but where they have a Warrant under the Great or Privy Seal (as in this caſe by the Grant and Letters Patents they have) for the doing thereof, ſo that the Court of Exchequer in this caſe, only takes care that the King's Grant and Letters Patents be made effectual, and that the Officers of the Crown do their Duties for that purpoſe, as by the ſaid Letters Patents they are enjoyned to do.</item>
               <item>VI. This Cauſe in conſequence muſt affect all Perſons Claiming under the Crown, or having any Talleys or Orders upon or Payments out of the Exchequer; for all thoſe will be made much better or worſe, by the Judgment of the Lords in this Caſe.</item>
