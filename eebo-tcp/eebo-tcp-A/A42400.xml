         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Warning to all Prieſts &amp; People; the Lord
is burthened with your iniquities, the
Lord God will overthrow your table of
Idols, and the imagination of your hearts
ſhall be confounded; the Lord God will
call to an account your Abomination, and the workers
of iniquity ſhall be confounded; the Lord is going about
to ſearch all hearts; the Dominion of the ungodly, ſhall
be overthrown, and the wiſdom of God revealed to the
ſimple, &amp; the prudence of the Serpent brought to nought;
the ſubtil ſhall be confounded in their own ſnares, and
the wiſdom of the eternall God ſhall ſtand for ever; the
pure in heart ſhall ſee God and live for ever, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterous
Woman ſhall be confounded: Long hath the
Heritage of the Lord layen waſt, through the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Harlot; but now ſhall the innocent judg the
Whore, her reward ſhall be doubled and her pride
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52064:3"/>
brought to nought, and the Merchants of the earth ſhal
howle over her, their profeſſion ſhall be taken away; the
abominations of all hearts is known to the Lord, their
wiſdom is accurſed: The bitter Root ſhall be removed,
and the Plant of the innocent ſhal ſtand, and the wiſdom
of God ſhall guide the pure; the Eternall Plant of the
Lord ſhall live for ever. Minde the wiſdom of God to
guide your mindes; the Light of Chriſt that ſheweth
ſin and evill, by it to be guided, til the imaginations of
your hearts be deſtroyed, and ſubtilty ceaſe, and the
dead ſhall riſe, and wiſdom ſet up. In ſtead of the Lord
you have obeyed ſubtilty, and the Lamb layen ſlaine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the abomination of your hearts: Now ſhal the Lord
ariſe and call to an account the heathen, and the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
that hath been ſlain ſhall judge the Whore, and
reward her double. The Righteous ſoul of <hi>Lot</hi> was grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at the abomination of Sodome; the Lord alone de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
him, by the wiſdome of God he was preſerved,
and the whole world was overthrown. Abide in the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God, O ye ſimple, that the innocent may be
preſerved, and the power of God known to confound all
your enemies, the luſt of the fleſh, and the pride of life;
that the bands of iniquity may be looſed, and the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
ſet free, and the Lamb upon his Throne. The Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the Lord hath long laine waſt, the ſeditious ſeed
of the Devill hath ruled. No longer will the Lord bear
with your abomination, he will confound your wiſdom,
and bring to nought your pride, the ſimple ſhal confound
your wiſdome, and your ſhame ſhall be made manifeſt
to all that dwel in the light of the Lamb; your deceit is
known to the pure God; he ſhall confound your wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and bring to nought your pride, the workers of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquities
ſhall be blaſted, and their Pathes conſumed;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52064:3"/>
and the Throned in the hearts of the innocent; he that
denies God ſhal be aſhamed in the day of his power,
when he comes to reckon with all fleſh; the Potentates
of the earth ſhal be confounded, and their glory brought
to nought. In the preſence of the Lamb can they not
ſtand, for the Lord alone ſhall be exalted; O ye bubbles:
why do ye rebell againſt God? why is your hearts exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
againſt the innocent that calls for purity? the light
of the Lamb diſcovers the deceits of your hearts, and
wil judge you in ſecret when you rebel againſt God the
pure God ſees you all, nothing is hid from the Lambs
preſence; his preſence is pure and holy, and no unclean
thing can ſtand before him; wherefore return to the
Lord, dwell in that which diſcovers ſin; then ſhall the
wiſdome of God be made manifeſt, &amp; his power known
to cleanſe your hearts, and to make manifeſt the works
of the Devill to be the enemy of your ſouls, that long
hath been exalted above the innocent, and the pure God
hath not been known; your wiſdom hath been exalted, &amp;
the innocent burdened, and the Lambs Power not known;
Pure is God, and wil bear your iniquities no longer, your
Tables of Idols ſhal be overwhelmed, and the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſhal raign: In the Day of the Lords Power ſhall his
enemies be made his Foot-ſtoole, and the worker, of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
ſhall be confounded; and over all ſhall the Lamb
raign; he ſhall bring to confuſion the counſel of your
hearts, and the builders of Babel ſhall be deſtroyed.
Bleſſed is that man that feares the LORD, by his
wiſdome ſhall he be guided. Dwel in wiſdome all ye
ſimple of the Lord, til Purity is Throned, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Lord is ſeen to confound your wiſdome, that
hath been exalted againſt God, that the Lamb may judg
and bring to nought the haughtineſs of man: And all
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52064:4"/>
that hath been exalted againſt the innocent; The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> God hath born your iniquities, long and patient hath
the Lord been, but now the innocent ſhall reign, the
whole earth ſhall witneſs his Power, and the wiſdom of
God ſhall be made manifeſt, the haughtineſs of man ſhal
be confounded; the Lord ſhall guide the hearts of the
ſimple, and dwel with them of low degree; the Ceaders
ſhall be cut down, and the plant of the Lord ſhal ſtand,
and his wiſdome ſhall guide the heart of the innocent,
who dwels in the Light of the Lamb, by it to be guided;
the exceeding wiſdom of God wil dwel with the poor,
and the rich ſhall be ſent empty away; he that is abaſed
ſhall be exalted, he dwels in the hearts of the lowly, and
the lofty to him is not known; he that waits on God
for wiſdom, ſhall renew his ſtrength, and the pure in
ſpirit ſhal ſee God and live; the proud he beholdeth a far
off, therefore ſhal your haughtineſs be judged of the
Lord, and innocencie shall overſpread the Nation, and
the Lamb shall be Throned for ever in the hearts of the
obedient: Obey God all ye Ceaders, let the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of your hearts be confounded; your shame shal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to all men; the Lord shall eſtablish the heart of
the innocent, who by him is guided; the eternall God
is wiſdome, and his Peace is end loſs; and Purity shall
poſſeſs the hearts of thoſe that fear him; his glory shall
never decay, his Plant of renown shall ſtand for ever:
The Root of the Devil shall be abaſed, that proceedeth
from the luſt and concupiſcence of man that was by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi>
fall, the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> maketh deſolate: The reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the Lord is pure, and purity poſſeſſeth the
light of the Lamb; the lambs purity is peace, and the
worlds glory is shame; therefore be ashamed you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
beaſts, and minde the light of the lamb you to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52064:4"/>
guide, that your bodies may be cleanſed from dead
works, to ſerve the living God, and ceaſe from vanity,
and obey the living God, who hath given every one a
Talent; the Lord ſhall be clear of your blood at the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
day, when a reckoning ſhall be made with all fleſh,
to conſume his enemies who hath trodden on the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and lent his ear to the wicked, by it to be guided,
while the Heritage of the Lord hath lain waſt; therefore
ſhal the Lord conſume his enemies, and bring to nought
their wiſdome, and the Lamb shall be throned in the
hearts of the ſimple for ever &amp; ever. <hi>Bleſſed is the man
that fears the Lord, he ſhall be as a Lanthorn to his pathes.</hi>
