            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A SATYR AGAINST <hi>The Pen-men and Speech-men of the Times.</hi>
            </head>
            <l>Now every Scribler does the preſs invade,</l>
            <l>And what was a Diverſion's grown a Trade.</l>
            <l>Some Poets born with five lame Feet for measure,</l>
            <l>And two bald Rhymes, think to give Reader pleasure:</l>
            <l>So with Ear tickling, and deceitful cadence,</l>
            <l>Supply the great defect of Wit and Sence.</l>
            <l>Some who for Verſe ne'r ſcratcht Pate, laugh at thoſe,</l>
            <l>That help out Sence with Rhyme, and in looſe Proſe,</l>
            <l>Vent yet more wretched Stuff themſelves; howe're</l>
            <l>With this advantage, that it does more appear</l>
            <l>In Prose; for where the Work's in measure wrought,</l>
            <l>The Rhyme oft hides the meanneſs of the thought.</l>
            <l>But now we have ſeen the manner, to the Men,</l>
            <l>And to the weighty Subject of each Pen.</l>
            <l>Here a brave Knight with hundreds at his heels,</l>
            <l>Through many a Street, Lane, turnings, windings, wheels.</l>
            <l>Lord Mayor at <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> thither he would reach,</l>
            <l>In pain till he's delivered of a Speech.</l>
            <l>There is grave form and ſtudied Oration,</l>
            <l>He ſhews first his Concern for the whole Nation.</l>
            <l>Then for the City his continual care,</l>
            <l>Tells them what are their dangers, what his fear,</l>
            <l>Requires Guards twice as many as before,</l>
            <l>For the <hi>Duke'</hi>s landed, and with him three more.</l>
            <l>But ſome who did the well-penn'd Speech obſerve,</l>
            <l>Believ'd it might a Comment well deſerve.</l>
            <l>Comment as well as Speech came both to light,</l>
            <l>But ſuch the Care and Intereſt of our Knight:</l>
            <l>Speech had its Anſwer, but <hi>Hawker'</hi>s Priſoner ſent,</l>
            <l>Though it explain'd but Acts of Parliament.</l>
            <l>Some ſay the <hi>Author</hi> deserv'd <hi>Hawker'</hi>s pain,</l>
            <l>For laying open City's Tricks of gain.</l>
            <l>For what had he to do with Sheriffalty,</l>
            <l>Or little ſecret Theſts by Livery?</l>
            <l>A ſawcy Slave, and ſo indeed he was,</l>
            <l>To oppoſe City's-Cheats with Stature-Laws.</l>
            <l>Yet ſome there are yet of another mind,</l>
            <l>For thoughts of men agree not like their kind.</l>
            <l>Theſe think 'tis ſtrange; if every one had right,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Author</hi> nor <hi>Hawker</hi> Priſoner, but the Knight.</l>
            <l>Here a bold Knave Succeſſion ſhall decide,</l>
            <l>And baniſh Princes with every ebbing Tide;</l>
            <l>And boldly tell you in his Speech or Song,</l>
            <l>(Call't which you pleaſe) to whom the Crown belongs.</l>
            <l>And as the Villain ſcans his Intereſts o're,</l>
            <l>'Gainst one, a point or two of Faith ſhall more</l>
            <l>Than a juſt Right by a thouſand years made good,</l>
            <l>And a continued Line of Royal Blood.</l>
            <l>But now leſt ill opinion ſpread too faſt,</l>
            <l>Another with his Rhymes to Preſs makes haſt,</l>
            <l>And thinks by them to give a helping hand</l>
            <l>To the great Right, which of it ſelf can ſtand;</l>
            <l>Sets forth his vertues, and many a mighty deed,</l>
            <l>As though thoſe vertues did his Verſes need.</l>
            <l>Both Fools alike, though each his due 'tis fit,</l>
            <l>This has leſs malice, but as little wit.</l>
            <l>Others who ſeek their Fortunes to increaſe,</l>
            <l>Which they could never do in Times of Peace,</l>
            <l>When ſcurvy Law and Juſtice bear the ſway,</l>
            <l>And give no countenance to Sword to pray,</l>
            <l>Seek to diſtract the Peoples minds with fear,</l>
            <l>Of Evils great, but know not when, nor where,</l>
            <l>Till they have drain'd their little Senſe ſo far,</l>
            <l>That themſelves though they know not why, cry War:</l>
            <l>For well thoſe Cannibals, too well they know</l>
            <l>The miſchiefs that from ſuch diſtractions flow;</l>
            <l>For though the Bar with private Difference rings,</l>
            <l>They know the Sword alone decides for Kings;</l>
            <l>And very well the Slaves remember too,</l>
            <l>How great that way ſome men but lately grew.</l>
            <l>But why ſhould States to ſuch protection give,</l>
            <l>Who by that only that ruines others, live?</l>
            <l>But ſtay, here's that make all their labours vain;</l>
            <l>The King's return'd, and in full ſtrength again;</l>
            <l>He by his health removes our loyal fear,</l>
            <l>Well may our Knight remove his needless care.</l>
            <l>Fires, Healths and Bells ſpake welcome in all parts,</l>
            <l>But none like that which ſpake all loyal hearts.</l>
            <l>Part of their Goods their joy conſumes, you read</l>
            <l>In that, that all the reſt is his at need.</l>
            <l>Well knew th' Almighty, enemy of ſtrife,</l>
            <l>The high Importance of the Sacred Life,</l>
            <l>The high Concern oft to both Church and State,</l>
            <l>And therefore kindly did avert the Fate.</l>
            <l>Pitileſs death! that with one ſtroke alone,</l>
            <l>Three Kingdoms had and their ſweet hopes undone;</l>
            <l>And juſt it was that we who liv'd in You,</l>
            <l>Great Sir, ſhould have one life, and die then too.</l>
            <l>Ceaſe then ye Scriblers, Preſs and Town t'infeſt,</l>
            <l>And Cautious Knight ſet thoughtful heart at reſt;</l>
            <l>For he who has ſo long our ſafety been,</l>
            <l>In this new life aſſures us oft agen,</l>
            <l>Our Laws free courſe, our Fortunes ſafely ours,</l>
            <l>Whilſt as we ought, we honour higher Powers;</l>
            <l>For ſure where Subjects Kings juſt Rights deny,</l>
            <l>Themſelves compel and cauſe the Tyranny.</l>
            <l>And what ſhould we but Fools and Knaves appear,</l>
            <l>If whilst' gainst <hi>Rome'</hi>s Religion we declare,</l>
            <l>Abhor their Principles, their Maxims damn,</l>
            <l>Our ſelves ſhould practiſe what we judge in them?</l>
            <l>Since our Faith's Theory teaches better things,</l>
