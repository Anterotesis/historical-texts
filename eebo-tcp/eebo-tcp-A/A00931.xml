            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>¶ TO THE RIGHT VVorshipfull, Sir VVilliam Cordell Knight, Maister of her Maiesties rolles: as much health, wealth, and happinesse as heart woulde wishe.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Wo yeares (right wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull) and somewhat more are now expired, since I, vpon the appearing of a blasing Starre in the South west, the 10. of Nouember 1577. presented vnto you a generall doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine touching that matter. Which worke if it shall please you at your leasure to conferre with the euents that haue insued, you will say that the translation was necessarie, and the publishing not vnprofitable.</p>
            <p>A learned and expert man commorant and abiding in this Citie, comparing the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects following that Comet, with the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations aforegoing, &amp; finding them strange, wonderfull, and memorable, thought it not amisse to commit a matter of such impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the consideration of his natiue Countrie, in a breefe treatise called by the
<pb facs="tcp:2428:3"/>
name of <hi>(A view of euents &amp;c.)</hi> wherin he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciphereth such issues within the compasse of one yeare, namely, from Nouember 1577. to Nouember 1578, as are not superficially, but aduisedly to be noted. Which woorke of his worthie the reading, because I am sure your worshippe hath seene and perused, (as no booke can escape your hands, if it sauour of learning and iudgement) I passe ouer with a bare remembrance.</p>
            <p>So (Right Worshipfull) the late Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake which happened the 6. of April, about 6. of the clocke in the Euening 1580. to the astonishment of the inhabitants of this Citie dispersed in sundrie places for their recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, set me (as many more) a musing: and tossing a thousand thoughtes in my head, I founde in my selfe a quicker inclination to wonder at Gods workes, than to write the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of mans wit. Staied neuerthelesse at last, it was my lucke, looking among such bookes as I haue, not manie in number, nor great in value, to light vpon a discourse so fit for the time, that I thought I should high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honour God, and doe great good to this lande, if I vndertooke the translation of the same.</p>
            <p>Persuaded herevnto in the ende, I did mine endeuour, with all diligence, to bring my businesse about: and still finding, as I went forwarde, the worke both weightie and worthie: besides that, so apt for this our age, as if it had bene penned of purpose vpon our late Easter Earthquake: I lost no labour, and
<pb facs="tcp:2428:3"/>
spent no time, till I had done my taske, which growne to some bignesse, as your worship seeth, I finished in fewe daies space, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the same to be presently printed.</p>
            <p>Perfourmed therefore, I am bolde, vpon hope of your wonted fauour, to make it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatorie vnto your worship: the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the generall doctrine of Blasing stars, of my rude translation, was published two yeares past vnder your protection: and this of Earthquakes, of the same Authours pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and my homely Englishing, doth not craue choice of a newe Patrone.</p>
            <p>Which that it will please you to accept, with no lesse encouraging countenance, than you haue vouchsafed my former trauelles: though I suspect not the contrarie, yet to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you it is my bounden dutie. Praieng al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God to lengthen your worships life, with increase of health, strength, wealth, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, &amp; whatsoeuer may make you fortunate: and when the date of your dwelling here on earth is don, to garnish you with the garland and garment of glorie, in heauen his owne habitation: where you may, to the fulfilling of all perfect happines, behold the face of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, by whose bloud all true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers are put in possession of that vnspeakable bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse.</p>

And as for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sort of men, it passed their capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie and knowledge to reach to the cause of such a secret: nay shall I tell you, naturall Philosophie setteth downe no sure ground or determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate sentence in this doubtfull mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

            <p>Now, because they worshipped many Gods, and therefore ignorant vnto what one God aboue the rest to dedicate their seruice, they proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that by not naming any one cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine God, all their Gods should be honored: least by choosing one speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to celebrate, &amp; so taking one for another, the people should be delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the God that wrought the wonder not a whit exalted.

Unto which opinion <hi>Plinie</hi> long ago gaue assent, supposing that nothing more than the windes, nay the winds alone to be cause of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes: and that the earth is neuer wont to quake, but when the sea is so calme, and the aire so still, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ships can saile, nor birdes flie: all the winds being gotten into cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine veines, holes, and caues of the earth, and there mooue by there se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete rusling.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not vnknowne to the learned, that in the kind of moouing and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king there is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: for the earth may quake ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waies. Now it is <note n="*" place="margin">Earthquakes some more dangerous &amp; dreadfull, some lesse perillous and fearfull.</note> a dangerous and fearefull Earthquake, when as the earth is rowled to and fro like a waue of the Sea: or when it beareth it self wholy to one side as it shaketh. Contrariwise it is not so perillous, when with quaking, the frames of houses and buildings cracke with shrinking: and when the earth swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth at a sudden, and anon falleth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: as also, when houses méeting together, ratle &amp; knocke one against another, by reason of interchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able moouing, the one resisting and withstanding the other. Such an Earthquake, and yet not lightly to be thought vpon, happened of late in this famous <note n="*" place="margin">Where he was Preacher at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, before he was called to be Bishop.</note> citie of <hi>Mentz,</hi> in the

For as the reuerend Father saith of such Earthquakes as he hath last na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that some are more dangerous, some lesse perillous: setting downe the manner of both: so say I in like case: for there was no such violent moouing, no such terrible shaking, no such ruinous renting, either of houses or Churches, no such ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing of Mountaines, &amp;c. that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny generall calamitie (God be than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked) did insue.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T remaineth that wée consider, what good or ill is foreshewed to insue or followe after Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes: a thing which all in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner haue desired to know and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, but none haue certainly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: many demanded the question, but few geuen the onset to make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere. As for me, I cannot but bée persuaded, that Earthquakes, how soeuer nature put to her hande as a ioynt worker in their generation, are not to be thought trifles, or to come to passe of <note n="*" place="margin">Something is ment by the happening of Earthquakes, though it passe our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie to comprise.</note> nothing: but hauing in them an hidden meaning and secret reason, foreshewe somewhat to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe either good or bad: a huge mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of examples left in writing to verifie this matter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:2428:17"/>And principally, to begin with the chéefest, that euerlasting trueth of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, our Sauiour Jesus Christ, the maker and Lord of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie creature, yea of nature it selfe, he (I say in whome all treasures of wisedome and knowledge are repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) affirmeth, that <hi>There shall bee Earthquakes, and all these thinges</hi> (saith he) <hi>are the beginnings of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, &amp;c.</hi> Giuing vs to note by an vndoubted coniecture, that before the last day of this worlde, there shall be Earthquakes, which are foretokens of vniuersall woes to come vpon all the worlde, and specially vpon the wicked, whose torments shall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeding sharpe and gréeuous.</p>
            <p>And thus we are taught euen out of Gods worde, that Earthquakes happening vnto vs, not simplie of custome, but of purpose, do signifie somewhat to insue, <note n="*" place="margin">Earthquakes are denuntia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and threatnings of gods wrath against vs.</note> &amp; denounce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs the wrath of almightie God, therewithall admonishing vs to amende our euill life, to reforme our wicked conuersation, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
<pb facs="tcp:2428:18"/>
in the spirite of the inwarde man, and to be heauenly minded: otherwise such sorrowes are like to light vpon vs, as shall turne to our most miserable ouerthrowe and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable destruction: and here vpon it came to passe, that when our Lord Jesus Christ was crucified, the earth quaked and trembled.</p>
            <p>But of what sorrowes to come are Earthquakes foretokens? First, to beginne, of <note n="*" place="margin">Warres<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stilence the effectes of Earthquakes.</note> warres, whereby it is most certaine pestilence and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine are ingendered: pestilence by the aire poisoned with the stinch of dead carcasses lieng vnburied: fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine by reason of husbandrie, when plough landes lie vnmanured: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides other calamities full of feare, horror, and desolation.</p>
            <p>Uerie<note n="*" place="margin">The Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the wordes aboue written.</note> religiously haue the Saints of God alwaies thought of Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, albert the wisedome of this worlde, which is foolishnesse before God, dreame of naturall causes. And surely, such as are well affected, and haue in them any féeling or taste of
<pb facs="tcp:2428:18"/>
Gods gratious spirit, after the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of an Earthquake, will say with the Prophet <hi>Dauid, Come and behold the workes of the Lord,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging in heart, that the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of God follow the righteous, as peace and plentie, tranquillitie of minde, with other his good graces: contrariwise, his curses pursue and chase the wicked, as warre and scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, horrour of conscience, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite tribulations.</p>
            <p>We <note n="*" place="margin">Reasons of comparison, to proue that Earthquakes are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to be referred to naturall causes.</note> sée that the rainebow appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the cloudes euery yeare at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse times: touching the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof reasons (I grant) may be giuen: but we knowe that the raine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowe being appointed by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, hath continued euer since it was first made, as a witnesse to the world that God will neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy it againe with water, for the trueth of which worde and promise, he hath left vs the rainebowe.</p>
            <p>Of Eclipses we know, there may be naturall causes alledged: but let vs remember that he, which in their
<pb facs="tcp:2428:19"/>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:2428:19"/>Of Earthquakes also and other visions of fire, there may naturall reasons be brought: but as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie can be decided by no wiser moderator than Christ our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and the Prophetes his forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: so is it our partes to take their authoritie for truth, and not to hunt after the vaine speculations of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie. <hi>Before the end of the world come</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>iniquitie shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, there shalbe rumors of wars, there shalbe <note n="*" place="margin">Earthquakes reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of signes that shall be seene before the end of the world.</note> Earthquakes, there shalbe famine &amp; troubles: all which if they be but the beginnings of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, alas what calamities will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe?</hi>

            <p>To rehearse the examples, which are alreadie touched, and more pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetically or effectually handled, than I can by skill comprise: it were su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous.

            <p>Let vs be resolued, that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth nothing now, but the day of our visitation.

            <p>Nowe, because it is manifest, that many wonders haue their cause and originall euen of nature, in such sort &amp; manner, that the very course of nature, doeth throughly teach, as well the set seasons, as also the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed places of such wonders: (For it hath pleased GOD to leaue vnto this course of nature, <note n="*" place="margin">God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ethsafe to vse the ministerie and seruice of Nature, in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie thinges y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> come to passe.</note> whose ministerie and seruice he voucheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe to vse oftentimes in naturall things, her conditions &amp; qualities, her operations and workings: and hée suffereth nature to beare rule ouer naturall things, and naturall thinges to incline and yéelde vnto

nature, himselfe winking thereat, and looking vpon as it were through a lattesse:) Herevpon it is possible, that a man may by certeine coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and ghesses gather, or by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine causes and reasons attaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the knowledge both of the times and places when and where the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of such and such things, séeme they neuer so strange and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, shall come to passe.</p>
            <p>To confirme this, I bring for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample <note n="*" place="margin">Some Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers faile not in the prognostica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teliing of things to come.</note> Astronomers skilfull and cunning in their profession, who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times know before hand, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shewe likewise the seasons &amp; effects of Eclipses, neuer failing in their prognostications: and yet there are some that holde opinion, that an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse is a meruellous matter, and such a thing in déede as is monstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, strange, and contrarie to the common course of nature. Howbeit, there is no cause why wée should wonder thereat more than néedes, as though it were a rare thing and not to be beléeued: seing it is a plaine

case, that the very naturall eiesight of man doth behold and comprehend as well the causes as the signes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing aboue him, as hée doth the firmament of the Heauen, and the Spheres of fire and aire.</p>
            <p>The Scripture in déede affirmeth, that * <hi>The stars of heauen were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed<note place="margin">Starres dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> times, the daies, and the yeares, so that vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them dependeth a necessarie do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> to be signes for the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence &amp; discerning of seasons, times, daies, and yeares.</hi> Which to be true and credible, we finde by vse and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome. For we sée, that by them the husbandman doth giue a ghesse what shall follow: and by the set seasons of the yeare vnderstandeth what hée should do by day, and what by night, learning in like manner at what time it is best plowing, sowing, and reaping, which benefit he hath chéef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by being cunning in the change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and wandering course &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of the Sunne and Moone.</p>
            <p>By <note n="*" place="margin">The Sphere of fire &amp; aire haue a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guitie or neerenesse.</note> the Sphere of fire also, &amp; of the aire, by reason of the néerenesse each to other, it is giuen vnto them of the countrie to coniecture this and

that: whiles (as we know) flames of fire in the aire, lightnings and thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, windes and raine, haile and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tempestes haue their issue from thence: the foreknowledge of which things is greatly in vse among hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen, shepherds, and mariners. These signes and appearances as they are naturall, and their causes naturall, so their effects being natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall may be forknowne of certentie. For the knowledge of the one is the knowledge of the other.</p>
            <p>But to come to <note n="*" place="margin">Wonders su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall are wonders in deede, and come not of causes natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</note> wonders super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, of which kinde are all such wonders as are to be counted very wonders in déede, the matter perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture goeth farre otherwise: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that as the causes of such won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are aboue our reach, euen so the effects and operations much more. Againe, all wonders, though super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, are not like, but diuerse: this also ouerthroweth the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of man. For the more diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, the more doubtfulnes. If this be so, who will not confesse, that the
<pb facs="tcp:2428:30"/>
effects and operations of such won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are vncerteine, both at what time, and in what place they shall come to passe? Concerning which matter, because some effects happen sooner, and some later, no certeintie able to be knowne, there can be no infallible and perfect rule giuen.</p>
            <p>But to touch some signes &amp; won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders appearing in the Heauens, this is a flat truth, that such were séene the very same yeare that <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was destroied, <note n="*" place="margin">Sometimes the effectes of wonders doe followe after, &amp; sometimes they happen at the instant: so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full &amp; vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine: this is proued by examples.</note> the effects whereof were prolonged a yeares space. So in <hi>Genua,</hi> at what time a spring there very straungly bubbled bloud, the citie it selfe was assaulted of the <hi>Sarracens,</hi> taken, and wonderfully afflicted. In <hi>Lucania,</hi> what time it rained iron, the very next yeare fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Souldiers of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie were all slaine, with their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Crassus,</hi> in <hi>Parthia,</hi> and not one mothers sonne left aliue. So, a litle before the time that <hi>C. Caesar</hi> was murthered, it was founde true by proofe, that his horses would eate no
<pb facs="tcp:2428:30"/>
prouender, but pining themselues, there fell teares from their eies so plentifully, that it was wonderfull to behold. So, after the sightes and visions which <hi>Daniel</hi> saw in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and told the meaning of them, there followed an ouerthrowe of the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire, and the famous vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie of <hi>Alexander.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By all which examples, as also by certeine wonders appearing at <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna</hi> in <hi>Austria,</hi> not many yeares past, we are taught, that there can no vndoubted <note n="*" place="margin">The doctrine touching the time &amp; place, where won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders worke their effects, is doubtfull.</note> doctrine be set downe touching the time when, &amp; the place where, the effectes of such wonders should come to passe: although the busie heads of the Heathen, no lesse vainely than superstitiously, haue dealt in that matter.

            <p>And hereof it is, that we are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinly assured, many wonders here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore to haue happened, wherof <note n="*" place="margin">Many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders haue happened in the worlde which neuer came to our knowledge.</note> we are ignorant: and better knowne vnto others than vnto vs: which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though wée had béene able, vppon knowledge to report, yet for tedious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse sake it were néedelesse to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate them in this place.

And thus (I say) may Physicians foretell something to come, not to any maner of person, but to such as haue not their perfect health, but are euill affected, and apt to fall into one or other strange infirmitie and sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
            <p>Euen so, by Ephemerides or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations manie things are foretold concerning the qualities of seasons, &amp; touching the Eclipses of the Sunne and Moone: howbeit none otherwise than when such causes woorke their force in the <note n="*" place="margin">The aire sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sunne Moone and Starres.</note> aire wherewith we are incompassed, and according to the inclination whereof, be it good, be it bad, be it wholesome, be it noysome, will we nill we, we are ruled and

Contrariwise, if they perceiue in the diseased such séemelinesses as set foorth the state of a sounde man, they are coniectures of recouerie and health. The like we may read in the particular progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stications of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and in the seconde booke of <hi>Cornelius Celsus,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating of Physicke.</p>

            <p>To applie this to our purpose, when wée sée such wonders in the worlde, as are strange and fearefull, when we sée them often in such ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as hath not béene in former times, it is an vndoubted token that the worlde is not well, but infected with certein sore sicknesses, and like shortly to die, or else to fall into great daunger: so much the rather, because signes and wonders, monstrous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances,
<pb facs="tcp:2428:35"/>
and strange sightes, haue their generation herehence, <note n="*" place="margin">From whence strange sights &amp; monstrous shapes, &amp;c. haue their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and being.</note> either because particular nature faileth, or through the default of the matter it selfe which resisteth, or else by reason of the weaknesse of the agent or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker. Which is thought to be a token that the worlde is sicke after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a man, who is therefore called a little worlde.</p>
            <p>Herevnto may be also added, that woonders of this sort, specially such as appeare fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen, or (to speake plainer) that are meteors and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, doe happen, when nature is somewhat disordered, as when the generation of cattell, the fructifieng of trées, the coniunctions and moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings of starres come to passe, but not altogether at their due and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie times: neither doe these im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions kéepe alwaies one and the selfe same place, nor yet holde one proportion still in respect of the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent (as I may say) the matter wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are made happening to and fro.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:2428:35"/>By that therefore which we haue already declared it is doubtlesse, that such signes and wonders as we haue last named, doe prooue vnto vs, that <note n="*" place="margin">The more strange sights and appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the more strange signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications and meanings.</note> straunger and rarer sightes appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring haue their significations: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the sicknes of this world, and the néerenesse thereof to death: and to be tokens so much the rather of these things, by how much more often they happen. As truly we sée in these times of oures, which in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are therefore called <hi>The last daies,</hi> wherin shall be the end of this worlde, foretold by signes and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to be at hand, by the deadly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases which they denounce to the worlde, as meanes to bring vpon it the last consummation &amp; finall end.</p>
            <p>For it cannot be denied, that <note n="*" place="margin">Wonders haue beene seene, euen since the very beginning of the world, in a manner.</note> such signes haue béen séene euer since the creation of the world almost, in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie countries &amp; nations, of diuerse people, either to the destruction of some, or to the ouerthrowe of all, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as many as viewed them with their eies. In time, the whole world,
<pb facs="tcp:2428:36"/>
by reason of the partes thereof cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie and ill at ease, began day by day to be sicker and sicker, because of the miserable maladies and pittifull issues which followed after the sight of such straunge wonders: so that by litle and litle it is like to faile &amp; to decay, and the whole bodie thereof in short space to perish, séeing that there are but a fewe members or partes thereof, beside the heart, but haue both felt and séene the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and ruines which haue come to passe, after the appearing of certeine straunge signes and wonders in all places, not onely in our forefathers daies, but also within the compasse of our memorie.</p>
            <p>The case standing thus, we must néedes graunt this, when all the members of the bodie are smitten with sicknes, that <note n="*" place="margin">For the heart cannot safely consist with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie and due seruice of the inferiour me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:2428:36"/>
these so many and horrible wonders chancing in our age, doe certeinly foreshew. For, the truth it selfe, by a foreknowledge of things to come, speaketh of these and the like signes, prophesieng of the end of this world, and saieng, <hi>There shall be signes in the Sunne and in the Moone, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, séeing that this worlde may well be compared vnto <note n="*" place="margin">The stare of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> worlde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to the state of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> for what reasons and considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> 
               <hi>Aegypt,</hi> in sundrie considerations, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde cases, it commeth to passe, that as in old time there were sights and wonders séene, whereby the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe of <hi>Aegypt</hi> was threatened should come: so in this last end of the world signes &amp; tokens are strangely séene in the foure elementes, which giue vnderstanding to all the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the earth, that the end is at hand. Now, for that we sée in these our daies, such signes and tokens multiplied, how can we doubt that the end of the world is nie? Special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because we sée things that haue increased, diminish: and things that flourished, vanish: and at length die
<pb facs="tcp:2428:37"/>
and come to an ende.</p>
            <p>Which <note n="*" place="margin">The chaunge of this worlde set downe by contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of other countries.</note> alteration of the world, and the diminishing thereof we shall perceiue to be come, if we thinke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the daies of old, and consider with our selues, how many countries, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Islands, in so few yeares haue perished and come to naught: &amp; how all the elements are growne out of course, quite contrarie to their first nature, and being meruelously chaunged in themselues, kéepe not their accustomed condition and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie in due time and season, as at the first: &amp; that the earth hath lost much of her wonted fruitfulnes, how pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully so euer it be plowed, as wée haue plentifully declared in our <note n="*" place="margin">A worke so intituled and named, and of this Authors owne writing.</note> Catholikes dedicated to the right re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, and <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand:</hi> which to repeate againe in this place, were labour superfluous.</p>
            <p>It must therfore be confessed, that these so sundrie &amp; straunge wonders happening in our daies, foretell vs, that the end of the world approcheth, and prophesieth against it some la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable

            <p>Now, because I thinke there is
<pb facs="tcp:2428:38"/>
not a man so shamelesse, that will gainesay this, it néedeth not that I vse many words in this matter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that we haue discoursed at large hereof, in our <note n="*" place="margin">Workes of his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piling and so named, as is declared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</note> 
               <hi>Centuries</hi> and <hi>Catholikes.</hi> It resteth therefore that we make answere in this place, to the obiection of some, which demand the question, not so necessarily as cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously: At what day and houre the end of this world shalbe, whereof the scriptures of God haue so profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spoken? Although I make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that it is not vnknowne to me, that some there are which haue taken in hande to tell by account of yeares, when the end of this world shalbe: of which sort some haue said, that foure hundred yeares, some that fiue hundred yéeres, some that a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeares should passe and runne out, betwéene the ascension of the Lord, and his last comming to iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, before the world should be at an end: yet notwithstanding, I <note n="*" place="margin">They are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed and put to silence, which by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of yeares gather the certeine end of the world.</note> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie that there is any man able to know, or to shewe, either the houre,
<pb facs="tcp:2428:39"/>
or the day of the end of this world: as also I hold opinion, and certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue, that there is not a man liuing, that knoweth the ende of his owne life, as the scripture testifieth, vnles he be instructed and taught from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue by some singular reuelation.</p>
            <p>And therefore, vpon this certeine beléefe I boldly affirme, that the end of this worlde hath alwaies béene, &amp; euer shalbe, altogether vncerteine: and that it is not for mortall men (as the Lord saith) to knowe the times and the seasons, which the Lord hath put in his owne will &amp; power: yea, that man cannot comprehende the same by any naturall knowledge, as the trueth it selfe prooueth, saieng: <note n="*" place="margin">All y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of this world quite cut off in man, by the testimonie of Scripture.</note> 
               <hi>Of that daie or houre no man knoweth, no not the Angels of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, nor the Sonne, but the Father: because the day of the Lorde</hi> (as the Apostle saith) <hi>shall come like a theefe in the night. For when they shall say peace and quietnes, then shall sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den destruction come vpon them, as the sorrowe of a woman in trauell,

and they shall not escape.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which words we are warned, that the last ruine and ende of this worlde shall come so suddenly vpon men, that when the state of thinges séemeth to be amended, and growne from worsse to better, famine turned into plentie, warre into peace, pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence into securitie: then, euen then, in the twinkling of an eie, it shall be consumed with fire. Beholde a spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle in <hi>Sodom.</hi> And this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as I take it, why the Lord doth exhort vs euerie where to watch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that as <note n="*" place="margin">An argument or reason drawne from the lesser to the greater.</note> no man is certeine of the ende of his owne life, so much more ignorant and doubtfull of the ende of the whole worlde. <hi>Take heed</hi> (saith our Sauiour) <hi>watch and pray, because ye know not when the time shall be. For you knowe not when the Lord will come, in the euening, or at midnight, or at the cockcrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or in the morning, least when he commeth suddenly, he finde you sleeping.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is Gods will, that as well the
<pb facs="tcp:2428:40"/>
ende of our owne life, as also the end of the world, should be hidden from vs, that we might euermore be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thereof, and setting our mindes vpon it, be readie at his comming. For <note n="*" place="margin">An allusion made to the example which Christ himselfe vseth in the Gospell.</note> the suspicion which the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the house hath of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the théefe, is very profitable, though it kéepe him waking, when peraduenture otherwise he woulde fall asléepe. And surely, if it were good for vs to knowe this secret, woulde the Lord haue made such a short an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to his Disciples, when they put out the question to him their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster? For they helde not their peace in the presence of him, but put foorth their demande, saieng: <hi>Lorde, wilt thou at this time restore the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Israel?</hi> But he spake to them againe, and said, <hi>It belongeth not vnto you to know the times, which the Father hath put in his owne power.</hi> This answere had they, not asking the question of the houre, or of the day, or of the yeare, but generally of the time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:2428:40"/>Uaine therfore are such, séeme they neuer so wise and learned in the eies of the world, which make their vaunt that they know the end of their owne life, &amp; are <note n="*" place="margin">The shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesnes of some which vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no sure ground will warrant y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> certeintie of things most vncerteine.</note> not ashamed to professe, though seduced by signes of birdes flieng, by opinions of the weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, by the doctrines of Magicians, and such like sinister meanes, that they can tell when the world shall be at an ende. But is not these mens laboure lost, whiles they goe about to reckon and cast account, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares are to come, before the worlde shall ende? Séeing we haue heard, euen from the mouth of truth it selfe, that it is not in vs, nor for vs to knowe it, and that it passeth our abilitie, whatsoeuer wée are, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine to the certeintie of a secrete, which God the father hath reserued vnto himselfe alone.</p>
            <p>And here I can not sufficiently muse at * <hi>C. Lactantius,</hi> and diuerse<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lactantius</hi> and others of his opinion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued, for their precise computations.</note> others not a fewe, men I confesse déepely learned in matters touching the Church, and verie well practised

the doore:</hi> we sée that there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth nothing else but this, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard our owne safetie: namely, <note n="*" place="margin">The mutuall seruice &amp; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties required of vs, and thought most conuenient for vs to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute in these latter daies of the worlde.</note> to exhort one another by all meanes that we may, not to abuse the good grace of almightie God, not wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to winke, when we sée such great store of light, but to haue our eies o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and to behold the strange sights and wonders, which we haue séene euen within the compasse of our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie: knowing for a certeintie, that these and such like are as it were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations made vnto vs from al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, whereby he calleth vs to repentance, and therefore not to be contemned, as nothing pertinent or belonging vnto vs.</p>
            <p>For it is as true as the Gospell, that God is long suffering, excéeding patient, and full of forbearance, doing what he can by these signes and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to soften the hardnesse of our heart: and he had rather shew vs the terrors of his iudgements, and the threatnings of his right hand, than laie the same vpon vs in his venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
<pb facs="tcp:2428:43"/>
Let vs not flatter our selues, because we are Christians, therefore God will forgeue vs though we doe not repent. No no: he <note n="*" place="margin">Herein appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth how iust and vnparciall a iudge God is, in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his punishments.</note> spared not the Angels, but when they had trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed, he thrust them downe into hell; and therefore doubtles he will not spare or forbeare vs in our sins. Againe, let vs not deceiue our selues, supposing peraduenture that such sorrowes as are to come, are not so horrible, as we haue set them out in this behalfe. For God himselfe hath foretold and said it should be so, who neither doeth lie, nor can lie, swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with an othe, that it should so come to passe: <hi>Verily verily I say vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, heauen and earth shall passe, but my wordes shall not passe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither let vs, to be bréefe, cocker our selues too much, &amp; become care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, because the woes wherof we are forwarned will not come yet, it will be long first ere they take effect.

               <hi>Alas wretches, what meane you to runne vp and downe from place to place after the vanities of this worlde?

            </p>
            <p>And therefore, to returne thither from whence I haue straied, let vs wey with carefull consideration, and in weieng, let vs tremble at the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full end of this world, and hauing the day of our owne death continually before our eies, let vs hasten, as much as we may, to amend our life missed. Let vs not neglect the time, because our good God forbeareth vs vile offenders, and his anger com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth forth but slowly to take venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: for this slownesse shalbe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compensed with gréeuousnes of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
<pb facs="tcp:2428:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and his lame legge (if I may so speake) shall neuer leaue, till it haue ouertaken the swift running sinner. This is doubtles, that how much the longer God looketh for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendement at our handes, and we regard it not, so much the more grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous shall his iudgement be against vs: which to be so, the Scripture by many examples hath not slenderly proued.</p>
            <p>Now, if we thinke (which thought be farre from vs) that <note n="*" place="margin">The danger of this cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is set forth in a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the Gospell, by our Sauiour himselfe, to shew what a shrewd sinne securitie is.</note> it will be long ere the end of this world come, and therevpon euery one of vs set at naught the consideration of our own falles, who are more miserable? Are we not (I beséech you) suddenly smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with death, and our soules taken out of our bodies, we looking for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lesse, whiles we very willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in the pleasure of our mindes, are well content to tarrie in this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken worlde, and determine with our selues of matters of long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance? But who are happie? Euen they that alwaies haue before their

eies, either their owne death, or the ende of this worlde, and that make hast to be found in a readines when that houre commeth.</p>
            <p>Let vs therefore be mindfull one with another, that we walke in the middes of the snares of the Diuell, and in consideration thereof let vs alwaies <note n="*" place="margin">The furniture which <hi>S. Paul</hi> setteth downe by parcels in the 6. chapter to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

Alas, let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the words of our Sauiour, saieng, <hi>Verily verily I say vnto you, the houre is come, when all that are in their graues shall heare the voice of the Sonne of God, and they which haue done well, shall come forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the resurrection of life: but they which haue done ill, into the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection

            </p>
            <p>Nowe therefore let vs take our choice, &amp; determine with our selues what to doe in this life, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our desertes, we may either reioice with the godly, or be tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the wicked worldes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end. <note n="*" place="margin">Whole some admonitions, if we haue the grace to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe them: which y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Lord God grant vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs.</note> If rewardes will not win vs to béecome better, let punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments make vs affraide to waxe worsse: and if it be not in our power to despise this present world, and to ceasse from the custome of sinning: yet let vs at the least doe what we can to redresse our selues by righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes.

<pb facs="tcp:2428:48"/>
promise &amp; purpose, the times when, and the places where Earthquakes haue happened, as I find them truly recorded in Chronicles, which I haue searched diligently: to report iustly to the people of this land, that <note n="*" place="margin">This is not the first time that God hath spoken vnto vs by Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes.</note> God hath spoken vnto vs manie yeares past, euen by such meanes as of late he vsed, wherein his long suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance appeareth, vpon the which I counsell no man ouer boldly to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume, by securitie in sinning, least iudgement and confusion fall vpon him suddenly. And first we will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne at London the Metropolis of this land, &amp; by degrées of yeares pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede to declare what Earthquakes haue chaunced in other cities and shires of this our natiue countrie.</p>
            <p>It is recorded in the Scottish Chronicles, that in the reigne of king <hi>Eugenius,</hi> it rained bloud at Yorke, that in sundrie places trées were blasted, and thereby withered and died: but (O wonder!) that the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket place, or rather <note n="*" place="margin">Many houses swallowed vp and sunke in Cheapside by a gaping of the earth.</note> Cheapeside in London did open and gape, so that a

great hole appearing in the earth, manie houses were swallowed vp and sunke: neither is it to be thought that no harme, in such an excéeding daunger, happened to the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. Thinke we, the same God, who wrought that wonderful worke in this Citie, was not able with the late Earthquake to haue done the like here in London? Yes, yes, his almightinesse is perpetuall, his will remaineth vnchangeable, &amp; his arme is not shortened.</p>
            <p>Againe, in the time of king <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> the Conqueror, in the yeare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the birth of Christ 1077. there hapned in March a <note n="*" place="margin">A generall Earthquake ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole realme of England.</note> generall Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake throughout all England: and in April next &amp; immediately follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a terrible blasing starre appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the horror of the beholders. Although this Earthquake now na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, shooke the foundations of all this land: yet, in so much as there is no mention made that it chaunced in other countries, therby we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that being inferiour vnto this
<pb facs="tcp:2428:49"/>
our late Earthquake in vniuersali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, (for so farre as I can vnderstand, both by trauellers beyond the Seas, and by strangers borne, it is suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that it was generall, and that the whole frame of the worlde trembled therewithall, farre greater harmes happening there, than here, the Lord be thanked) it could not import or foreshew such a plague as this threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth against vs, nor include in it so secret a meaning. The Lord in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie deale with his people, for in iudgement none shalbe able to abide his presence.</p>
            <p>Againe, in the time of the said king <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, in the veare after the birth of Christ 1084. there chanced an Earthquake, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was but <note n="*" place="margin">A particular Earthquake and yet super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall: the reason may be read in the rehearsall of the historie.</note> particular, yet may it séeme to bée supernaturall. For, at such time as king <hi>William,</hi> among all other cruelties executed vpon English men, pulled downe whole townes, villages, churches, and other buildings, thirtie miles compasse, to make thereof a forrest,
<pb facs="tcp:2428:50"/>
which at this day is called by the name of New forrest, it pleased God, beside the lamentable outcries of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted people ringing about the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants eares, to giue a token by the earth, which at that instant shooke and rored, of his indignation against that vnnaturall destroier for his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed dealing.</p>
            <p>As for him, who by his power might presume somewhat further than a priuate man, I thinke he was not so mercilesse a spoiler, but that in this our age there may be founde, millians I feare (I would to God I did lie) which excell him by many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées. For the worlde is growne vnto this abhomination, in these dayes, that <note n="*" place="margin">The craftiest man accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the wisest, as the worlde goeth nowe a daies.</note> the craftiest man is counted the wisest, and he that hath most circumuentions in him to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoote his brother, is had in estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As for simplicitie and plaine dealing, it is so little thought vpon, as if it had neuer béene in the world. No maruell then, though God by vniuersall signes sent throughout all
<pb facs="tcp:2428:50"/>
corners of the earth, foreshewe the sharpnes of his sworde, wherewith he meaneth to come girded, &amp; wound vs in his wrath, our iniquities are so outragious, so manifold, and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable.</p>
            <p>Againe, in the reigne of King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> the first of that name, in <hi>Ianuarie,</hi> in the yeare of our Lord 1165. there hapned a meruellous Earthquake, in the Isle of <hi>Elie,</hi> in <hi>Northfolke,</hi> in <hi>Suffolke,</hi> and other places, the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie whereof was such, that with the trembling of the same, men had not the power to stand vppon their féete: buildings also were sore sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and stéeples so rocked, that the belles knolled therewithall.</p>
            <p>And in the reigne of King <hi>Henrie</hi> the second of that name, at <hi>Oxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hale</hi> within the Lordship of <hi>Derling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> in the yeare of our Lord 1179. the <note n="*" place="margin">These exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples may be loking glasses for vs, if we had any grace.</note> earth did lift vp it selfe on high like a mightie towre, and continuing so from nine of the clocke in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning till the euening, it fell downe at length, with a horrible noise: &amp; swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb facs="tcp:2428:51"/>
vp with the sudden and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent sinking of the same, left a déepe pit in place thereof, as a witnesse to the posteritie of that strange won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. These documentes or lessons as they are not vsuall, so ought they not negligently to be thought vpon: and therfore, woe to the wicked, that are growne so senseles and voide of fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that no iudgement of God can soften their stonie hartes.</p>
            <p>To procéede in our examples, for we meane to tell you of later Earth quakes, some in the daies of our grandfathers, our fathers, and our owne. On Monday the wéeke before Easter 1185. in the reigne of the said King <hi>Henrie</hi> the second, there happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note n="*" place="margin">The second general Earth quake that I reade to haue happened in England.</note> a generall Earthquake tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughout all England, yea such a one, as the like had not beene heard of in this realme, since the beginning of the world. This Earthquake was so violent, that stones which were couched fast in the earth, and driuen in with rammars, were remooued out of their places, buildings of lime
<pb facs="tcp:2428:51"/>
and stone ouerturned, houses of tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber shaken in shiuers: and among the rest, the great Church of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colne</hi> was rent from the toppe to the bottome. After this Earthquake there followed a vniuersall Eclipse of the Sunne, and such terrible thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, lightening and tempestes, that both men and beasts were destroied, houses burned vp, and much harme done very lamentable to report.</p>

there happened in diuerse places of England, and namely about Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, in the yeare of our Lord 1247. a terrible Earthquake, wherewith (as in such chaunces is commonly séene) houses went to wracke, &amp;c.
