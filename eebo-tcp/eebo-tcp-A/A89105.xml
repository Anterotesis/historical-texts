         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
MESSAGE
OF
John Lambert Eſq,
In ANSWER to the
PROCLAMATION.</head>
            <p>I Have not been ſo long verſed in the Intereſt and Concern of this State, (in whoſe greateſt
Affairs (ſince a Commonwealth was imagined, and accordingly framed by an Army) I have
deſerved the name of a Second) as to ſtartle at the ſound of a Proclamation, and quit my
hopes and deſigns, or ſurrender at the firſt Summons, which ſcares none but Cowards and men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided:
I ſee 'tis oftentimes the fortune of Greatneſs and Ambition to be clouded and eclipſed,
as 'tis likewiſe the more eximious and conſpicuous luſtre of ſuch grandeur to redeem and recover its
ſelf from its ruines and obſcurity. The great <hi>Marius</hi> taſted of this viciſſitude while he lurked in the
Fens of <hi>Minturnae,</hi> and yet a more popular perſon great <hi>Rome</hi> afforded not.</p>
            <p>Shall I gratifie by the meanneſs of a never yet dejected Spirit, the impoſſible intrigues of my Rival?
and muſt I and my Fame be, proſtituted to the pleaſure and <hi>Lubet</hi> of a Treaty victory? Shall I diſarm
my minde, and abandon my ſelf and my Friends (whoſe number and courage lackt but its proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of wiſdom,) and kneel at a Bar, that have paſſed the Pikes and defy'd Artillerie? Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
let as much reproach ſtick on my Atchievements in the Camp, as on my wives Feats in the
Bed.</p>
            <p>Of how much and great importance the very Name of a General is, this laſt half year hath am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
informed the Nation: and can it be rationally thought that I will forgo that Title, and become
a private perſon, further then this my preſent retirement? I know I am deſigned a Sacrifice to the
<hi>Peoples Liberty,</hi> whom the interruption and violation of this preſent Parliament moſt highly diſpleaſeth.
But am I thereforc onely to be blamed? why not <hi>Fleetwood, Whitlock?</hi> all the burthen muſt (it ſeems)
reſt upon my ſhoulders, that have more then I can well bear already on my head? or elſe is it but a
fetch, and a ſpecious pretence, thereby utterly to diſable and weaken my intereſt in the Army, and ſo
to make room for a new Gameſter.</p>
            <p>Well, my Fates, (for I ſcorn to whine with my Friend <hi>Desborow)</hi> do you pardon me. I diſdain
mercy, 'tis a word not befitting a great minde; if I have betrayed or ſlighted the good and common
benefit of three Kingdoms, I have undone my ſelf, and ſo may others, and thats ſome part of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to my Country. Yet, why may there not be a lucky reſerve, and a fortunate aftergame for
me, while I have the long <hi>Legs</hi> of the Anabaptiſts inſtead of Fortunes <hi>Forelock</hi> to hold by.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> and I are now in the ſame predicament (ſaving my inviolable Liberty, that <hi>Noli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
tangere,</hi> for all Generall <hi>Moncks</hi> fierceneſs) my comfort is the <hi>Ananias's</hi> will not purchaſe my eſtate,
no more then the Presbyters will Sir <hi>George</hi>'s, and I do not know who elſe will or can, for the
Cavaliers have no money, and beſides are no ſuch good <hi>State-Husbands:</hi> Well, adieu, Fare ye well,
if any one enquire after me, I am in the purſuit of Sir <hi>Thomas Midleton.</hi>
