            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
RIGHT HONOURABLE
CHARLES
E. of Shrewsbury, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have ever been ready to own all Obligations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
from any Man; but being favour'd by so
great and good a Man as your Lordship, I think it
so much to my honour, that I cannot but be proud
of it, which makes me take the first occasion to publish my
Gratitude, and boast of your Patronage. Nor have I any
other end in making bold with your Lordships Name be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this Trifle. I would not be so unreasonable to desire
your Lordship to defend the weakness of my Writings: I
have been by long sickness made very unfit for that Task.
A man ought not to hope to Please the world very much,
who is not at ease, and somewhat pleas'd himself: Tho I
have no reason to complain of the reception of this Play.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62059:3"/>For my own, but much more for my Countrys sake,
I rejoyce that there is a <hi>TALBOT</hi> still left to sustain
the Honour of that Illustrious Family; so able, so sincere,
and so disinterested a Minister; so real a Lover and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourer
of his King, equally faithful in his Services to him,
and true to the Interest of his Country. (Nor can any
one be faithful to the first, who is not true to the latter);
for in effect they are but one; and they can never be odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
enough who endeavour to divide it.</p>
            <p>We still have a <hi>Talbot</hi> who is a firm Friend to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi>
and a just Enemy to the <hi>French;</hi> and I doubt not, my
Lord, but you will live by your Counsels and Actions to
become as terrible to them as any of your brave Ancestors
have been. I dare not be too forward in your just Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations,
Praise being not the end that a man who is
truly great ever aims at; nor does an ingenuous Man delight
in it: To such the conscience of doing well is the only satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
But one thing out of the abundance of my heart
I cannot restrain my self from observing in your Lordship.</p>
            <p>The most important business of this world, the Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Youth (which ought to be put into the hands of the
ablest, wisest, most learn'd and vertuous men, who have no
other interest but the bettering of mens minds; and because
of the great trouble of the Office, it ought to have great
Rewards and Dignities affix'd to it by the publick) is for
want of those encouragements put upon such mean, weak,
or corrupt persons, that it is the greatest task of a mans life
to break loose from his Education, and shake off the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
he contracted by it; which none but a great <hi>Genius</hi>
ever does<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The rest, tho of the highest rank, swallow eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb facs="tcp:62059:3"/>
thing unchew'd, and take every thing unexamind from
their first Dry-Nurses in Petticoats to their last in Square-Caps:
Women begin with them, and young Priests end
with 'em, who are sure to bring 'em up to the interest of the
Clergy, tho it be never so much against that of the Laity.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship, by strength of Understanding, and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
Enquiry, early perform'd this great Task, and freed
your self from those Principles instill'd into you in your
Youth; which would have made you incapable of being
a good Subject and a great Patriot in your riper age; and
have since became so eminent in both characters, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man that heartily loves the constitution of our <hi>English</hi>
Government, has a profound Respect and Veneration for
your Lordship.</p>
            <p>Nor will your share of Honour deserve to be less in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
than that of the bravest of your Ancestors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> since none
could ever more freely adventure Life, Estate and Honour
for their Countreys Freedom than your Lordship did. And
it appears to me to be much a greater Glory to be highly
instrumental in the Redemption of ones own, than in the
Conquest of another. And I beseech your Lordship pardon
this interruption of your business or diversion, from him
who is, without any mixture of fawning, most sincerely,</p>
            <closer>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>

            <l>SOme of our Authors special Friends will say,</l>

            <l>And for a new, shall find a damn'd old Play.</l>
            <l>He on a <hi>Spanish</hi> Plot once writ before,</l>
            <l>And some the Priest with great impatience bore;</l>
            <l>But tho the Party took it much amiss,</l>
            <l>They had not the good breeding then to hiss.</l>
            <l>Our own Sir <hi>Roger</hi> on the Stage appears,</l>
            <l>And why should not a foolish Priest of theirs?</l>
            <l>On that foundation then he built, 'tis true,</l>
            <l>But like <hi>Drake</hi>'s Ship, 'tis so repair'd 'tis new;</l>

But to prevent much Brutal Hiss and Stamp,</l>
            <l>Send out the fiercest Champion of your Camp:</l>

            <l>You might have better Words, were it not plain</l>
            <l>The gentlest usage of you is but vain;</l>
            <l>E'n take your course, our Poet bid me say,</l>
            <l>If all of you be such dull Fools to pay</l>
            <l>For being displeas'd, come and Hiss every day.</l>
            <l>If good the Play, your Hisses will be vain;</l>
            <l>If bad, no Claps its weakness can sustain.</l>
            <l>If this be lost, he's not of all bereft,</l>

            <l>He's sure by this his Friends he shall not lose,</l>

Charm'd me. Hah, what Madness is this to fall in Love with one I know not!

Ha Madam, that was a subtil way of discovering your passion, but it will not
serve in my case. But I must find some means to let him see my face, and if
he like it, so, if not, mercy on me, I dare not think on what must follow.</p>

               <p>Put on thy Hat <hi>Hernando,</hi> thou hast been too long my Fathers good
Servant, not to be my Companion, and art to have the next Commission that

            <sp>
               <speaker>Hern.</speaker>
               <p>Not when that folly allows you nothing of your self. Doat upon a Wench,
jealous, vex'd, and disquieted for a Wench!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Luscin.</speaker>
               <p>Speak with more Reverence of a Wench, why from <hi>Mexico</hi> to <hi>Iapan,</hi>
is there such a joy, such a comfort as a Wench: What do Kings War
for but for power, and power for what? To have what Concubines they please,
there's the end. What do we Officers fight for, but for Money and a little
Honour, to get a Wench? what have Priests, Bishops and Cardinals profits and
Dignities, but to procure Wenches? Is there a man in <hi>Spain,</hi> Lay or Spirititual
without a Wench, who has Wit or Money enough to get one? And then to
speak thus irreverently of one!</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Hern.</speaker>
               <p>Pardon me Sir,—I wou'd have a Wench to please me, but not to
trouble me.</p>

               <p>Of all our Art and Industry, our toyl and hazard, Woman's the sweet

over Women?</p>

               <p>A Gentleman may have a little innocent lust, or so, but to fall in love,

            <sp>
               <speaker>Hern.</speaker>
               <p>Oh sye Sir; Your true Lover sighs and pines, and seeks out shady
Groves, and murmering Brooks, and tells his mournful tale, with Arms a cross
to Eccho, and never thinks his Mistriss is a Woman, but a Goddess.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Luscin.</speaker>
               <p>No where but in Romances, why there's no diversion or conversation
in <hi>Madrid,</hi> but with a Curtezan. The men are too grave (not to be uncivil and
saydull) and the honest Women are lockt up; besides none in <hi>Spain</hi> are so well
bred as your Curtezans, <hi>Hernando,</hi> no more.</p>

this <hi>Levia,</hi> and she is wavering, there are others as handsome in <hi>Madrid,</hi> see her
no more</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Luscin.</speaker>
               <p>Pain is but a relishing bit, to make us taste our pleasure better; she
has made me jealous, which spurs up my restive Love, that wou'd have Jaded
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62059:7"/>
otherwise whilst she lov'd only me, I cou'd have lov'd another, but now she
loves another, I can love none but her.</p>

               <p>In Affairs of Love, he that shews most Love is most civil; and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
show it more than by eagerness and haste: Treaties of Conjugal Affection are
always short and pithy. A word to the wife: <hi>Don Bernards D' Alcantara</hi> would
make <hi>Donna Belliza</hi> his Spouse, and enjoy her Person incontinently: hah, Widow,

could take a blow from any man. I fear I've been too rash, and am undone.

            <stage>Spoken by Mrs. <hi>Bracegirdle.</hi>
            </stage>
            <l>MEthinks I hear some Ladies nicely wise,</l>
            <l>(I do not mean the vertuous, but precise)</l>
            <l>Cry down us <hi>Spanish</hi> ones, and call us light,</l>
            <l>Who entertain our Lovers at first sight.</l>
            <l>But Ladies think, were you like us confin'd,</l>
            <l>Alas! you'd soon be of another mind.</l>
            <l>You at the first fair game before you eye,</l>
            <l>As fiercely as unhooded Hawks would fly.</l>
            <l>Though Nature largely does for us provide,</l>
            <l>Yet all its beauteous store, we're forc'd to hide,</l>
            <l>Which but by dangerous stealths is never spy'd.</l>
            <l>You can your Faces every where expose,</l>
            <l>And throw your piercing Darts against the Beaux:</l>
            <l>But we are wiser yet than you; for we</l>
            <l>Ne're wait a second opportunity.</l>
            <l>You shall for Months your amourous glances cast,</l>
            <l>And bring it but to Scandal at the last.</l>
            <l>We never spread our loving Nets in vain,</l>
            <l>We soon come to a point, and ease the pain:</l>
            <l>Your Beauties you so oft in publick show,</l>
            <l>That Gallants of your Faces weary grow.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:62059:33"/>So that before you're known, you are enjoy'd,</l>
            <l>And Sparks, before they come to taste, are cloy'd.</l>
            <l>To feed their Pride, not Love, some have a train</l>
            <l>Of flutt'ring Slaves, to grace their stately Reign;</l>
            <l>Their sickly appetites are so diseas'd,</l>
            <l>They make men jealous, and themselves not pleas'd.</l>
            <l>We're seldom seen, and but by those we like,</l>
            <l>And when the Iron's hot, ne're fail to strike.</l>
            <l>But though we're wiser, you are happier still,</l>
            <l>As if we had no Souls, we have no Will:</l>
            <l>For our Tyrannick Countrey thinks it fit,</l>
            <l>To Kindred or to Husbands we submit.</l>
            <l>Whene're we are discover'd by ill chance,</l>
            <l>A life is forfeit for a single glance.</l>
            <l>Your Sisters or your Daughters safely stray,</l>
            <l>And with a Groom or Parson run away:</l>
            <l>On this affront the Kinsmen never think,</l>
            <l>But as they use to do, hunt on and drink.</l>
            <l>For every Favour a poor <hi>Spanish</hi> wife</l>
            <l>Bestows on her Gallant, she ventures life.</l>
            <l>The wanton <hi>English</hi> ones need never fear,</l>
            <l>By their good men they're ever held most dear,</l>
            <l>And none such hands over their Husbands bear:</l>
            <l>The Husband none so closely does embrace</l>
            <l>As the sweet Gallant who supplies his place.</l>
            <l>VVell—</l>
            <l>Though on the Stage we <hi>Spanish</hi> women be,</l>
            <l>Elsewhere we can use <hi>English</hi> Liberty.</l>
            <l>Now for the <hi>Poet,</hi> I ha' nought to say,</l>
            <l>Has cast himself upon you, and ye may</l>
