         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Colonel BUTLER,
A MEMBER of the House
of Commons in Ireland.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Honoured and Worthy Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Generous Incouragement,
which you were pleas'd to
give to <hi>all my Auctions of
Books,</hi> and the Extraordinary and
Unmerited Kindnesses I receiv'd at
your <hi>Hands,</hi> when in <hi>Ireland,</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden
me to trouble you with
this <hi>Dedication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confess it may justly seem un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of the Acceptance of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of so <hi>Great Honour and Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
as you are known to be: Nor
can any thing less than your <hi>own
Goodness,</hi> find an Excuse for this
Presumption: But having had such
large Experience of the Excellency
of your Temper, and of the <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of your Soul,</hi> I should be unjust
<pb facs="tcp:59888:3"/>
to your Character, if I did not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
own, that you measure the
Tokens of Gratitude by the <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of your Friend,</hi> and not by the
Value of the thing presented.</p>
            <p>Give me leave then, <hi>Worthy Sir,</hi>
to inscribe your Name to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Sheets, as a Great Patron
of Learning, and a Generous Friend
to an <hi>injur'd Stranger,</hi> who came
to promote the Interest of Learning
in your Country.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Kindness</hi> you were pleas'd
to Vouchsafe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>unto me, and the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
you express'd for my Welfare,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
me that you will not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
to be my Patron in defending
my self in Print in <hi>England,</hi> seeing
I could not have the opportunity
of doing it in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I must indeed own that <hi>your Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
and Courage</hi> Entitles you to be
the Champion of such as are enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in a more <hi>Masculine Quarrel</hi> than
the <hi>Scuffle betwixt</hi> Patrick Campbel,
<pb facs="tcp:59888:3"/>
               <hi>and my self.</hi> Yet you know Sir,
that the Greatest Captains, after
the Campaign is over, do sometimes
divert themselves by seeing a <hi>Mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fight
on the Stage.</hi> This, Sir, has
something more in it, as being a
<hi>real piece of Injustice</hi> first committed,
and then defended by my Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
who has arm'd himself with
<hi>Impudence and Malice,</hi> and manages
his Attacks by Fraud and Forgery;
as I have made sufficiently clear in
the following Sheets.</p>
            <p>I confess, Sir, the Entertainment
you will meet with here, is not
answerable to that <hi>Hospitable and
Generous Treatment I was honoured
with at your House;</hi> and that I am
not capable of gratifying your Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity
with such excellent pieces
of my <hi>own drawing,</hi> as you were
pleased to feast my Eyes with, when
I beheld with wonder, <hi>the effects of
your happy Pencil!</hi> Yet, Sir, I dare
say, that I present you here with <hi>an</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:59888:4"/>
ORIGINAL; which, tho' drawn
by an unskilful Hand, has something
very surprizing in it; <hi>such Features,
such a mixture of Hypocrisie and double
dealing cover'd over with a false Varnish
of Religion,</hi> that I question much,
Whether <hi>Patrick</hi> may not pass for a
<hi>Iudas Redivivus?</hi> And were my
Pen able to keep pace with your
Pencil; or had I the Art of temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my Colours, drawing the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to the Life, and observing due
Proportion, I doubt very much,
Whether <hi>Africa</hi> could shew any <hi>such
Monster,</hi> as I should here present
to the publick View?</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Worthy Sir,</hi> I must beg your
Pardon for daring to offend the Eye
of such a <hi>Curious Artist</hi> as your self,
with such a deformed piece. It
were indeed unpardonable, did I
not know that by one Glance of
the Eye upon your own Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Eminent Vertues, you will
immediately race out those foul
<pb facs="tcp:59888:4"/>
Idea's which the <hi>fight of Patrick</hi> may
impress upon your Imagination.
<hi>Contraries expos'd to the View at one
and the same time, do mightily illustrate
one another;</hi> and therefore when you
see his <hi>Picture,</hi> and reflect upon your
own, you will find great Cause to
bless him who hath made the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction.
<hi>Pardon me Sir,</hi> I don't
think your Vertues need any such
foyl to set them off; for they are
such, as when <hi>compar'd</hi> with those
which render the Enjoyers of
them Amiable in the Eyes of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
will undoubtedly give you the
Preference amongst Thousands; but
I must break off, lest <hi>my Affection
should offer Violence to your Modesty;</hi>
and lest it should be said, I only
<hi>commend my self in extolling my Patron:</hi>
I must indeed own that the <hi>Honour
of your Friendship</hi> is one of those things
that I value my self most upon, and
esteem my self happy in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
by <hi>Patricks Enmity,</hi> which gives
<pb facs="tcp:59888:5"/>
me this Opportunity of letting the
World know, that Collonel <hi>Butler
is my Friend:</hi> Or, if that be a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation
to you, that you are an
Encourager of Learning, and a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector
of those that Endeavour to
promote it.</p>
            <p>I shall add no more, but beg <hi>your
Pardon for prefixing your Name to such
a Trifle.</hi> You know Sir, that how
meanly soever it be perform'd, it
was absolutely necessary for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of my Reputation, which <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick
Campbell</hi> has so unjustly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to destroy; and seeing it is
usual with Authors to attone for
their own Defects, by chusing an
<hi>Honourable Patron,</hi> I hope Sir, you
will indulge me the same Liberty.
May you Live long, to be an Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to your Country, and the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of His highest Esteem,</hi> who is,</p>

been thrown upon me about <hi>the</hi> 2d. <hi>Spira,</hi> and
the multitude of things I have Printed; both
which are here accounted for, and I think I may

            </p>
            <p>As to my <hi>Scuffle with Patrick Campbel,</hi> (a <hi>Dublin</hi>
Bookseller) I found my self obliged to publish
all the Circumstances of it to the World, that I
might not be wanting to my <hi>own Reputation on

sufficient to stop the Mouths of all Cavillers.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second Part</hi> of my Book is Intitled (what

try what he <hi>cou'd do by Women,</hi> since he durst
not face me himself, or <hi>Answer my Challenge in
Print:</hi> and therefore I publish <hi>Dorinda</hi>'s <hi>Billet</hi>
with my <hi>Dublin Scuffle,</hi> as it seems to be part of
it.</p>
            <p>Had I been caught in the Snare (as my <hi>inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Friend</hi> further observes) there's no reason
to doubt but <hi>Patrick</hi> wou'd have blaz'd it on the
House-top. 'Tis true, the <hi>Billet</hi> was really
sent me, (and my Answer directed to St. <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>'s
<hi>Coffee-house on Cork-hill,</hi> where it lyes still
for any thing I know to the contrary) but
wou'd it save my Life, I cou'd not tell who sent
it, nor cou'd I ever guess at the Author; but <hi>I
know my Innocence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and therefore am not <hi>afraid
or asham'd</hi> that the World should see <hi>Dorinda</hi>'s
<hi>Billet, and what an Enemy I was to her Assignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
which is writ as if she were acquainted with
me, the better <hi>to allure or fright me to her wanton
Arms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Third Part</hi> of my Book, which I call
my <hi>Conversation in Ireland,</hi> 'twas necessary to
add it to my <hi>Scuffle with Campbel, and the Irish
Dorinda,</hi> that the World might see (by my
<hi>Method of Living</hi> in that Country) what little
reason I gave <hi>Patrick,</hi> to sucffle with me; or to
the <hi>Irish Dorinda,</hi> to tempt me to her lewd Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Account of my Conversation</hi> was really sent
in a Letter to a <hi>Lady of High Birth;</hi> and the
Answer to it is a Letter of her own Writing;
but who she is, I having promis'd to conceal her

it from me: Tho', wou'd she <hi>honour</hi> me so far,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59888:7"/>
as to let me tell who she is, it would add
greatly to the sale of my Book, and perhaps oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
<hi>several Impressions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> But this is a Favour
I can't expect. However, to make my <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation</hi>
as agreeable as I well cou'd, I've intermixt
it with <hi>particular Characters</hi> of the most Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Persons I convers'd with in the Kingdom
of <hi>Ireland;</hi> but more especially in the City of
<hi>Dublin:</hi> And if in these Characters I've been
too lavish in any one's Praise, or have <hi>describ'd
some Persons what they shou'd be, rather than what
they are,</hi> 'tis excusable sure; for who knows but
these, by seeing <hi>how charming Vertue wou'd make</hi>
'em, may endeavour to practise it?</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, If these ben't <hi>Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sons</hi> sufficient
for publishing <hi>my Conversation in Ireland,</hi> I might
add one more; and that is,—<hi>I publish it to please
my self;</hi> Why may not I have my Humour, as
well as others? I promis'd my <hi>Summer Rambles</hi>
for the Diversion of the Gentlemen in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
who incourag'd my Auctions; and this <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation</hi>
is a part of 'em: And, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> if that
<hi>Honourable Lady</hi> to whom 'tis directed (or your
selves) do but cast a favourable Eve upon it, I
have my end: And, who knows what success I
may have? For the World is at present much
upon the search after <hi>Voyages and Travels;</hi> to
which <hi>Rambles</hi> being something a-kin, they are
I hope coming in fashion too; and I may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
to offer at something of that Nature, since
I have <hi>cross'd the Sea half a dozen times; visited</hi>
America, <hi>and been four Months together on the
Ocean.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>William Cornwallis</hi> saith of <hi>Montaign</hi>'s <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>says,</hi>
That it was the likeliest Book to advance
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59888:7"/>
Wisdom, because the <hi>Authors own Experience</hi> is
the chiefest Argument in it: And indeed, shou'd
every Man write an <hi>History of his Life, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
as well his Vices as Vertues,</hi> and have them
with simplicity related; how useful wou'd this
prove to the Publick! But this may rather be
wished for, than expected, since Men have ever
preferr'd their <hi>own private Reputation</hi> before the
real good of themselves or others. But now,
if contrary to the mode of <hi>such Travellers</hi> as lose
their Thoughts in the open Air where they were
conceiv'd, I have with more Diligence register'd
mine: It was out of no Opinion they <hi>deserve a
longer Life,</hi> but to prevent Idleness. The chief
thing I seek in publishing this <hi>Dublin Scuffle</hi> and
<hi>Conversation in Ireland</hi> (next to clearing my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
with respect to <hi>Campbel, Dorinda,</hi> and
other Enemies) is by my Pen to find Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for a Spirit that wou'd <hi>break the Vessel,</hi> had
it nothing to work upon. To those that are
angry at my <hi>frequent Digressions,</hi> I answer here
(with the ingenious <hi>Montaign</hi>) that <hi>Constancy</hi> is
not so absolutely necessary in <hi>Authors as in Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands;</hi>
and for my own part, when I have my
Pen in my Hand, and Subject in my Head, I
look upon my self <hi>as mounted my Horse to ride a
Iourney;</hi> wherein, although I design to reach
such <hi>a Town by Night,</hi> yet will I not deny my
self the Satisfaction of going a Mile or two out
of the way, to <hi>gratifie my Sences with some new
and diverting Prospect.</hi> Now he that is of this
rambling humour, perhaps will be pleas'd with
my <hi>Conversation,</hi> (which is little else than a
hasty digression from one thing to another.)
However<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in this I have (as I said before) the
honour to imitate the <hi>Great Montaign,</hi> whose
Umbrage is sufficient to protect me against any
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59888:8"/>
one age of Criticks; and 'tis well it is so, for,
<hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I am very sensible that 'tis safer to
make 50 Challenges at <hi>Sword and Buckler, long Sword
and Quarter-staff,</hi> than to play one <hi>Author's Prize</hi> on
the Bookseller's Stall; for the one draws but Blood,
but by the other a Man is drawn and quarter'd.
<hi>To appear in Print is worse than hanging;</hi> for the
Torture of the Halter is but an Hour or so; but
he that lies on the <hi>Rack in Print,</hi> hath his Flesh
torn off by the Teeth of Envy and Calumny,
though he meant no body no harm. Nay, some
of my Brethren themselves are turn'd <hi>Demi-Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi>
and call every thing <hi>Stuff,</hi> that has not
their own Name to it. There's <hi>P. C. T. F.</hi>
and <hi>two or three more ill-natur'd Fops,</hi> if an Angel
should send a Copy to Phil—they would call
it <hi>Stuff,</hi> except they had a share in it. But I
shall meet with them elsewhere; and would
have these ill-natur'd Criticks take notice, <hi>that
I wear my Pen as others do their Sword,</hi> and for that
same end too; and don't care <hi>one Rush</hi> whether
thy approve or condemn what I write. It is
not their Judgment that I value, and therefore
think it <hi>below my Regard,</hi> any otherwise than to
vindicate my self from their Calumnies.</p>
            <p>Thus Gentlemen, have I given ye a distinct
Account of the <hi>Three Parts of my</hi> Dublin <hi>Scuffle,</hi>
with the true Reasons for my publishing of it.
As to the <hi>Two Letters and Verses</hi> that lead the
<hi>Van,</hi> they came to me with no other Direction
than, For <hi>Iohn Dunton;</hi> at the <hi>Raven</hi> in <hi>Iewen-street;</hi>
and I think I can do no less in point of
Gratitude and Civility to their Authors, than
to print 'em as an <hi>Introduction to my Scuffle,</hi> with
this Assurance, That you have 'em in the very
Dress they came to me in. The <hi>Letters and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59888:8"/>
Verses</hi> will I presume speak for themselves; but
for my <hi>own Performance</hi> I shall say nothing. I
must own you have hitherto used me with much
<hi>Civility,</hi> which makes me the less apprehensive
of any danger now; <hi>but come what will,</hi> I'm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to stand to your Courtesie, and shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways

ON THE
Dublin Scuffle.</head>
            <div type="introduction">
               <p>I Hope (Sir) you will not esteem it an <hi>unci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Address,</hi> if I put you in mind of the
<hi>Scuffle</hi> you promis'd us; I can tell you
that we are all in <hi>mighty pain</hi> for it;
and truly, unless you <hi>speedily deliver us,</hi> shall be
apt to conclude you have <hi>given up the cause.</hi>
You can't imagine what advantage the <hi>Scotchman</hi>
makes of the Interval; I met him accident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the other Day at <hi>your Friend Dick</hi>'s, where
his chief business was to traduce and revile you,
and indeed, I believe he had went on with his
shew, if I had not started the <hi>Scuffle in your Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication;</hi>
When I told him, we expected it here
in a Month, I found it <hi>stung him to the very Soul;</hi>
he put himself instantly into his Natural Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
of <hi>Rubbing and Scratching,</hi> and in my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
made as many wry Faces, as he us'd to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59888:9"/>
do formerly at the <hi>Buckling on of his Pack;</hi> and
verily, I was not wanting to give him now and
then a lift.</p>
               <p>But after all, you must send it away with the
utmost expedition; all your Friends, <hi>Nay, the
whole Town</hi> earnestly expect it from you,
and truly in my Judgment you cannot come off
of it now, without a manifest Injury both to
your <hi>Interest and Reputation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here's <hi>poor Dorinda</hi> too; What can
you imagine <hi>She</hi> thinks of the Matter? I'll
warrant you he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that our <hi>City Dames</hi> resent the thing so very ill, that
if they should once find her out, I would not be
in her Coat for his <hi>whole Pack;</hi> and for <hi>Niff Naff</hi>
himself too, if after all they should find that he
had any singer in the <hi>Contrivance,</hi> he had best be
sure to keep a <hi>strong Padlock upon his Trouses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, but I have sent you a <hi>few Irish
Rhymes</hi> too, which you may either commit
to the Flames, or some empty place in your
Book, as you shall think 'em worthy. You
know <hi>Irelands but a barren Country for such sort

                              <hi>has met with from all Lovers of Books,
that encouraged me to bring to this Kingdom
of</hi> Ireland, <hi>a General Collection of the most
valuable Pieces in</hi> Divinity, History, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
Law, Physick, Mathematicks,
Horsemanship, Merchandize, Limning,
Military Discipline, Heraldry, Musick,
Fortification, Fire-works, Husbandry,
Gardening, Romances, Novels, Poems,
Plays, Bibles and School-Books, that have
been Printed in <hi>England</hi> since the Dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Fire in <hi>London</hi> in 1666, to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Time.</p>
                           <p>In this <hi>General Collection</hi> you'l find that
many a good Book has lain asleep, as not
being known, and when a Book is not
Publish'd, it cannot be nourished by the
favourable Acceptance of the World: I
might Instance in Mr. <hi>Turner</hi>'s <hi>History of
the Remarkable Providences which have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
in this Age,</hi> of which there is near a
Thousand disposed of in <hi>London,</hi> and scarce
Twenty of 'em Sold in <hi>Ireland,</hi> though by
viewing the Contents of this Work (which
are given <hi>Gratis</hi> at <hi>Dick's Coffee-House</hi> in
<hi>Skinner-Row</hi>) 'twill evidently appear there
is not a more useful Book.</p>
                           <p>Now Gentlemen, as <hi>Books are the best Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture
in a House,</hi> so I see no Reason why
others with my self, should not think their
<hi>Variety</hi> the most excusable Prodigality;
and therefore as the good success <hi>Auctions</hi>
have met with, with my <hi>Natural Love to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59888:14"/>
Travelling</hi> (as appears by my Venture of
this Nature to <hi>New-England, Holland,</hi> and
other Parts, in the Year 1686.) put me
upon this Undertaking, so I hope you will
give it incouragement in some proportion
to my great Expence in Purchasing and
bringing over so large a <hi>Collection;</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
Gentlemen, as this Sale is designed for
your Profit, as well as my own, so it seems
of right to Challenge your Protection,
which if it receives, I shall not value what
<hi>some little prejudic'd People</hi> can do to discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
it: I design by this no Reflection on
my <hi>Brethren in this City,</hi> for to do 'em Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
they acted generously, and gave me
all the Countenance I could expect (all
save <hi>Patrick Campbell,</hi> who grins at my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.)
Though had they not,
<hi>Learning and Knowledge</hi> are such real things,
they need no other props to support them,
but what is cut out of themselves; and a
better <hi>Medium</hi> to effect it, than by reading
Books, I know not. And though there
be a Complaint that the World seems op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
with Books, yet do we dayly want
them; if it were not so, what is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that many of great Estates can hardly
make <hi>their Minds or Thoughts stretch to a
Geometrical Measuring of their own Lands?</hi>
but surely he that has Money in his Pockets,
and will starve his Brains, (when so many
new and valuable Pieces are brought to his
Door) <hi>deserves to be posted;</hi> for what can

goodness of this Collection, so to his Care
and Fidelity (my Health calling me to
<hi>Wexford</hi> to drink the Waters) is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Charge of the whole Undertaking,
And I think I need add no more, for tho'
it has been Customary to Usher in Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings
of this Nature, with insignificant
and tedious Commendations, which serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only to tire the Readers Patience, and
stagger his Belief, and may perhaps be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
now upon a <hi>Collection</hi> which might
justly Challenge the Precedence of what
has ever been Exposed to Sale in <hi>Ireland;</hi>
yet being resolved to proceed in <hi>quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Methods</hi> to what has been formerly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
I'll manage the whole with that Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
and Sincerity, as shall leave no room
for Exception: For as Gentlemen come
here supposing to buy a <hi>Pennyworth,</hi> so I
do assure 'em I think it unjust to advance
the Rate upon 'em by any <hi>Vnderhand-Bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:
And for every Penny I get that way, I
will restore a Pound;</hi> neither did I suffer any
of my <hi>scarce and valuable Pieces</hi> to be <hi>cull'd
out</hi> from the rest (tho' importun'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
by several Gentlemen, and Booksellers)
that all might have <hi>equal Treatment,</hi> and
the greater Reason to attend my <hi>Auctions.</hi>
And I am very willing that the Ingenious
and Learned should be their own Judges
in this matter, not doubting but upon an
Impartial view of my <hi>Three Catalogues</hi>
                              <pb n="7" facs="tcp:59888:16"/>
(of which this is the first) they will find
not only such <hi>Variety of New Books</hi> as were
never before in <hi>Ireland</hi> (and <hi>scarce ones</hi> no
where else to be purchased) but such Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosities
in <hi>Manuscripts and Pamphlets</hi> (of

                     <p>I Have receiv'd the Kindness of yours,
by which I perceive that neither <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of Place,</hi> multiplicity of Business,
nor variety of Diversions, and some times
<hi>Distractions,</hi> are able to divert the stream of
solid Friendship, but that you have <hi>still a
Minute to spare</hi> in remembrance of your
old Acquaintance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I</hi> am glad to find you have Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to go on with your <hi>generous Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking</hi>
of imparting to <hi>Ireland</hi> so many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
Pieces of Learning. <hi>I</hi> don't know
why some of 'em may not be accounted
<hi>Phoenixes,</hi> as being reviv'd since the Fire
of <hi>London,</hi> or rather sprung up from its
Ashes.</p>
                     <p>Time was when <hi>Ireland</hi> was famous for
Learning, and hence it came to be said of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59888:17"/>
a certain Great Man, whose Name does
not now occur to me.</p>
                     <q>Ivit ad Hibernos Sophia mirabile claros.</q>
                     <p>But <hi>I</hi> am afraid the Case is much alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
since. <hi>Slavery and Popery</hi> have had so long
and universal a Possession of that Countrey,
that the Spirits of the Native (or Wild <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish</hi>
at least) are much degenerated, so
that we may now apply to them as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Reverse,
<q>Vervecam in Patria crassoque sub aere Nati.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>If your Design may be any way subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient
to restore Learning among them, you
will have Cause to <hi>value your self upon it
while you Live.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But my Friend, <hi>I</hi> perceive by your
Fears of a SCUFFLE, that you will
find it more difficult to Conquer their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices,
at least of some of them, than <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard
Strongbow</hi> found it to make a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
of their Nation; but <hi>I</hi> hope you are
so much a <hi>Philosopher</hi> as to prepare your
self before-hand for cross Emergents, that
you don't lose Courage on their approach.</p>
                     <p>Never was there that <hi>Great or Good</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
yet in the World which did not meet
with Opposition, and if yours happen to
be singular in this Respect, it will be as
remarkable a Passage, as many that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
in the <hi>Irish Story.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:59888:18"/>
You know <hi>I</hi> am no pretender to the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Prophecy,</hi> but methinks I foresee a
<hi>Storm</hi> coming upon you. My Reason is
this, Whatever the Honesty of your Design,
and the fairness of your way of dealing may
be, and which I persuade my self the <hi>Irish
Climate will never be able to alter;</hi> yet you
must expect that those of your own Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
will look upon you as an Interloper,
or perhaps a Fore-staller and Ingrosser: If
you can Convey Learning to <hi>Ireland</hi> thro'
their <hi>Channels,</hi> so as there may be some
<hi>Gold-Dust</hi> left for themselves at the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
you may perhaps 'scape pretty well;
but if otherwise, I am much mistaken if
you don't experimentally find the falshood
of that old saying, That <hi>Ireland</hi> entertains
<hi>no venemous Creature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I cannot but applaud your Honesty in
promising not to <hi>advance the Prices upon
Gentlemen that come to buy, by Vnder-hand
Bidding.</hi> To do otherwise, is not only to
Act two different Parts with the Satyr in
the Fable, but according to the Northern
Proverb, <hi>To Play both the Thief and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,</hi>
and I wish you had left more of that
sort of Honesty amongst some of your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
at home. We have not so much of
it our selves, as to send <hi>such a Cargo</hi> of it
at once to our Neighbours; the worst I
shall wish those Gentlemen, who practise
the contrary Method, is, that they may
never have any other Buyers, but their
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59888:18"/>
own <hi>Vnder-hand Bidders,</hi> for that is the
likeliest way to reform them.</p>
                     <p>But though I am Confident you will be
as <hi>good as your Promise in this Matter,</hi> yet all
your Honesty will not be Armour of Proof
against a Weapon you have put into the
Hands of your Enemies, which is, that
you Promise a <hi>Penny-worth</hi> to those that
will buy at your <hi>Auction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Proposal is indeed as charitable as
that of Selling below the Market-price to
the <hi>starving Poor,</hi> but you know those who
practise this Method, have as many Curses
from the Ingrossers of Corn, as <hi>Blessings
from the Starvlings</hi> whom they save from
Death.</p>
                     <p>Learning, I do verily believe, <hi>runs low in</hi>
Ireland, generally speaking; and no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it should, when they have not <hi>Books at
moderate Rates,</hi> and therefore your <hi>bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Design</hi> to the Publick, will not be able
to atone for the Injury which some Persons
will be ready to apprehend from you in
their Private Affairs. If you Sell a better
Penny-worth than they, you must expect
their Envy; and the Consequence of that,
is all that's unjust and mischievous.</p>
                     <p>But let none of these Things discourage
you, <hi>go on with your good Design</hi> of disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
those Books in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that are fitted
for their Instruction and Diversion; <hi>Profit
and Pleasure ought to go Hand in Hand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:59888:19"/>
I would not frighten you, by represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only the black side of the Cloud. I
hope you will meet with some <hi>fair weather;</hi>
try if you can invite the Muses in your
<hi>Summers-Ramble,</hi> to make a visit once more
to the <hi>Irish Par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>assus, and to disperse the
Liberal Arts amongst the Kerns.</hi> What Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is it, that a People who are generally
so fair of Body, should not have better
Means to cultivate their Souls.</p>
                     <p>You are very well furnish'd with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Materials for so good a Work, if they
fall into charitable Hands.</p>
                     <p>You are accustomed to <hi>Rambling,</hi> to use
your own Term, though some would have
the Ambition to call it <hi>Travelling;</hi> and if
as other Travellers do generally drop Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
in those Countreys which they visit,
you drop Learning too, it will be a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Advantage.</p>
                     <p>I must take leave to dissent from one of
your Propositions, <hi>That Books are the best
Furniture in a House,</hi> and I believe you will
be of my Mind too, when you know what
it is; and I will tell it you frankly, that I
think a <hi>Good Wife is better;</hi> but both of
'em do well together. I could the
more readily have pardon'd your Mistake,
if you had not known the Truth of what I
say, by both sides of Experience, but of this
enough. It would seem by you that <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
thought them equal, seeing he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
<hi>the Queen of Sheba</hi> with part <hi>of his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59888:19"/>
Library,</hi> for if we may believe <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>rester Iohn,</hi>
she was one of his Concubines, that pass'd
for a sort of Wife in those Days, and from
their Bed it is he pretends to derive his
own Original. This must needs Enhance
the Value of Books (and the Stationers
Trade) seeing they were the noblest Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
that the wisest of Princes could think
on, to make to the wisest of Queens.</p>
                     <p>Had that Prince happened to live when
Printing was Invented, he had certainly
been a great Incourager of the <hi>Booksellers-Trade</hi>—He
who knew the sweets of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Understanding, and press'd others
so earnestly to the pursuit of it, would
have thought himself very Happy in such
a proper and easie Method of acquiring and
diffusing it.</p>
                     <p>Yet such is the unhappy Genius of too
many in this Age, that they Care not how
empty their Brains be, so they can but <hi>Stuff
their Bags,</hi> or their Bellies—Covetousness and
Sensuality are equally Enemies to Learning.
The Miser laughs at those, who spend their
Time and Strength in search of the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers-Stone,</hi>
the Grand <hi>Elixir,</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram
Potabile,</hi> whilst he has the <hi>Aurum Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabile</hi>
under a sure Guard of <hi>Locks and Bars.</hi>
The Sensualist doth in the same manner
Ridicule those, who Abridge themselves
of Sleep and other Conveniencies, in the
pursuit of Knowledge. He thinks the best
Ornament for the Head is <hi>a fine Hatt and a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59888:20"/>
flanting Wigg;</hi> a good Complection owing
to the Bottle, is preferrable in his Sense, to a
Pale Face, the usual Reward of Study. He
had rather be taught how to cut Capers
with his <hi>Heels,</hi> than enabled to Judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Truth and Error with his <hi>Head.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These are some of the principal Reasons,
why Learning makes so <hi>little progress</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
many, who by Providence and
Nature are furnish'd' with Opportunity
and Ability to acquire it.</p>
                     <p>Your Instances of the value put upon
Books, by <hi>Plato, Arch-Bishop Vsher, and
King Iames</hi> I, are pertinently brought in,
and may they be as perfectly copied.
Knowledge is without doubt, the most va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
of all sublunary Treasures. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
was certainly of that Opinion, when
he said, that <hi>a poor and wise Child was better
than an old and a foolish King.</hi> Wisdom
had something more Charming in his Eyes
than any thing the <hi>Crown and Scepter</hi> could
afford; whence we may rationally infer,
that <hi>Solomon</hi> would have preferr'd the Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
of those that should have brought him
a <hi>Cargo of good Books,</hi> to the Industry of his
Richest Merchants, that brought him Gold
and Silver from the <hi>Indies,</hi> which some
Modern Authors understand by <hi>Ophir.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Thoughts of this may be enough to
support you against the <hi>Cavils</hi> of those,
who may happen to oppose you. Seeing
the <hi>Native result of your Voyage to</hi> Ireland,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59888:20"/>
is to make good Books common there at a
moderate Rate, for which others would
exact upon their Customers.</p>
                     <p>I shall conclude this long Letter with
this one Remark, That your Fancy soars
too high, and your <hi>Mind is too nimble for
your Body.</hi> To talk of compleating your
Ramble in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to visit <hi>Scotland, France,</hi>
and <hi>Italy,</hi> and to be in <hi>London</hi> by <hi>Christmass
next,</hi> is somewhat too much for <hi>Pegasus</hi>
himself; for you have known him some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
play the Jade. I find you are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
oblig'd to go to <hi>Wexford</hi> for your Health,
whence I am afraid you will be induc'd to
alter your Project. For if your <hi>Body won't
keep pace with your Mind, you must send your
Thoughts upon the Ramble, and spare the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kass:</hi>
However I approve of your return to
<hi>London</hi> by <hi>Christmass,</hi> for at that Time we
have generally as good Cheer in <hi>England,</hi>
as you will find any where else.</p>
                     <p>Give me leave to adde one Word, as to
<hi>your Conditions of Sale.</hi> If the Conditions
of your Chapmen be as Fair, you have
Reason to expect all possible Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but I am afraid you will find <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
Observation hold as true in <hi>Ireland</hi> as
in other Kingdoms, where the Buyers do
usually say of the Merchandize, <hi>It is naught,
it is naught,</hi> but when they have once got
it into their Possession, they will be sure to
boast of their Penny-worth. I have no
more to adde, but pray you to make haste
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59888:21"/>
Home, and in the mean Time fortifie your
self against the Distemper of the Countrey,
by its own natural Product, I mean a <hi>good
Freeze Coat, lin'd with Vsquebaugh:</hi> but
don't linger too long, least our minc'd Pyes
be all eat before you get over, for I look
upon them to be a more proper Cordial for
a <hi>true English Stomach.</hi> But I shall exceed

thinking that the Room where Gentlemen
had found such fair Usage in my <hi>Auction,</hi>
would give a <hi>Reputation to his, takes
it over my Head,</hi> (and Mr. <hi>Wild's</hi> too, as
he had the Promise on't, when my Sale
was done) Pressing <hi>Dick</hi> to the Bargain by
those moving Arguments <hi>of a double Price,

Twice,</hi> either to my self, or to Mr.
<hi>Wilde,</hi> to whom he promised the Refusal.
<hi>Gentlemen,</hi> This was odd Treatment, but
because <hi>my stay in</hi> Dublin won't permit
me, to do my self Justice, I chose rather
to quit my Right, then contend for't; but
had <hi>Dick</hi> considered how far <hi>the Rules of
Civility</hi> to me, and Gratitude to Mr. <hi>Wilde,</hi>
should have sway'd with him, (Mr. <hi>Wilde</hi>
not only being the Proprietor of the
Shelves, that stood in the Room, but also
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59888:23"/>
the first that brought an <hi>Auction</hi> thither,
that had kept several there, and was the
means of bringing Mr. <hi>Thornton's</hi> formerly,

on these Things, his Eyes had been Proof
against the <hi>double Price</hi> (that <hi>Dick</hi> in his
Letter tells me, <hi>Patrick</hi> had agreed to give
him) and the <hi>Scot</hi> might have gang'd

                           <p>I shall be glad to see <hi>Patrick acquit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi>
but I much doubt it, when I consider,
the <hi>dark usage I had in Turner</hi> (of which

you see what the <hi>Scotchman ITCH'D</hi> to be
at; and to add to his Favours, <hi>he now takes
my Room over my Head;</hi> which I must tell
him, resembles a Man I once met in my

different Titles, Turning</hi> Hodder <hi>into</hi> Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
Cumpstey <hi>into</hi> Whaley, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as his Customer wanted) with as
much Dexterity as the Suttler in King
<hi>Iames</hi>'s Camp, who drew <hi>Ale out of one
end of the Barrel, and Beer at the other.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that's said here, is designed as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
on any other of my <hi>Brethren in
this City,</hi> for to do 'em Justice (as I said
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59888:24"/>
in my first Letter) they <hi>acted generously,</hi>
and gave me all the Countenance I could
expect; all save <hi>Niff-Naff</hi> (the <hi>Proud
Loon</hi> of <hi>Skinner-Row</hi>) who formerly
Grin'd, and now Barks at my Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
But when I came to <hi>Ireland,</hi> I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to <hi>fight with Beasts at</hi> Ephesus; and
if he proceeds as he has begun, we shall
<hi>Scuffle</hi> in earnest; but if we do (as good
Luck is) such is the Impenetrability of
<hi>Innocence,</hi> and my just Undertaking, that
he can do me no Harm: For I bless God,
my Name and Reputation stands much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
him, but he Labours (<hi>though 'tis yet

the Venom he spits at me, that 'tis easie

you, what <hi>Persuasion</hi> he is of, seeing he
has so very little either of <hi>Iustice or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,</hi>
but at present he's the Chief, if
not the only Enemy I have; His <hi>Private

Questions: And now my Hand's in <hi>at ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Questions,</hi> I'll ask <hi>Patrick</hi> how he
rested <hi>on Sunday Night?</hi> For he was visiting
the Press by seven on <hi>Monday</hi> Morning,
sent his Spyes by eight, <hi>and his honest
Drudges</hi> were on the Stool of Repentance
by nine, and by ten (with Cap in Hand)
were at <hi>down-right asking my Pardon for
Composing Reasons they durst not Print;</hi> this
again makes me ask, Whether <hi>Campbel</hi> did
not <hi>privately see my Reasons</hi> before they
went to the Press, and a Printed Copy of
them after it was told me the Title was
distributed? And whether he did not <hi>pay
the Printers for Composing them,</hi> they being

me in that Matter? And if so, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                           </p>
                           <p>Gentlemen, being <hi>fall'n amongst Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
I</hi> shall ask a Question or two about the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59888:26"/>
                              <hi>Dublin-Booksellers;</hi> as, Are they a <hi>forgiving
Company? (for they are so in</hi> London) <hi>and
can they Pardon a kneeling</hi> Patrick, <hi>for some
little Lye in way of Trade?</hi> and which he has
own'd to 'em; sure they may, when he's
<hi>a Saint of their own Countrey; I</hi> have more
Questions to ask, and from thence could
descend to others Particulars; <hi>but I'll spare</hi>
Patrick <hi>for his late Iustice, in detecting the
Thieves that robb'd</hi> my <hi>Ware-house;</hi> and if
<hi>I</hi> knew of one more Vertue he had, I'd
proclaim it on the House-top, and to make
it the more observed, <hi>I</hi> would afterwards
<hi>blaze it in the</hi> London-Gazette: For Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
as I'm a true Friend where <hi>I</hi> take
a Fancy, so <hi>Patrick shall find me as fair an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy;</hi>
sure <hi>I</hi> am, did Gentlemen know my
great Charge in <hi>Removing to</hi> Patt's, the <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio's,</hi>
and Buyers, which <hi>I</hi> lost upon that
Occasion, they'd say <hi>I treat</hi> Patrick <hi>with a
World of tenderness;</hi> all that I've said yet,
is but <hi>self-Defence;</hi> and though this Feud
should end with <hi>a bloody Nose</hi> (for <hi>Dick</hi>
suspects it began with one) yet I'll still be
so just to <hi>Patrick,</hi> as not to belye the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.
Gentlemen, to convince you of this,
I'll venture at <hi>no Buts nor Hints of Things,</hi>
(Buts and Hints, when they are no more,
are the worst sort of Murthering a Man)
but what <hi>I</hi> can (and will when he answers
this) prove at length, on which I'll be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
a few Annotations, as a <hi>Key to the

Thus Gentlemen have I given you the

or the een, <hi>alias</hi> only, Mon of Coonshence,
(<hi>as the Geud Man at the</hi> Bible <hi>has call'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi>)
but what I'll Prove, and Reply to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Day, if there be Occasion.</p>
                           <p>Gentlemen, <hi>Though I have been thus thrust
out of my Room to make way for St.</hi> Patrick <hi>and
his</hi> Auction; I hope, you will allow me
to say something of my own, though your
<hi>general Acknowledgment</hi> of the fair Dealing
you had in it, seems to render this Work
unnecessary; for you all know, I begun <hi>my
Sale on a just Foundation,</hi> did not interfere
with any Man's <hi>Auction</hi> (there was none
mentioned in <hi>Dublin</hi> till I came) nor did
I take <hi>any Mans Room over his Head;</hi> or
had I innocently done such a thing as that,
upon Notice given by the injur'd Person,
(<hi>such as</hi> Patrick <hi>has had over and over</hi>) I'd
have flung up the Bargain at first Word:
And I may speak the freer in this Matter,
as 'tis a Thing I have done in <hi>London; and
as I begun my</hi> Auction <hi>on a just Foundation in</hi>
Dublin, <hi>so the Books I sold were as fairly bought
in</hi> London; I took Advantage of no Mans
Ignorance, as Mr. <hi>Wilde</hi> knows, in getting
in the whole Venture; of this he can
give you several Instances, but that of Mr.
<hi>Sh—n</hi> might suffice for all; and as my
Books were honestly bought, and the <hi>Sale
begun on a right Foundation,</hi> so I have had
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59888:27"/>
a Blessing on the Undertaking; and tho'
<hi>I fight with Beasts at</hi> Ephesus, whilst I've a
Cordial in my own Breast, I shall fear
nothing; the Truth is, I was ever more
afraid of my Self then of all the World, <hi>a
Man cannot fly from himself (every Man car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
an Executioner in his own Breast</hi>) so
that a Man's Conscience (in some Sence)
is the only Friend or Enemy he has in the
World.</p>
                           <p>Gentlemen, had I <hi>begun my</hi> Auctions (<hi>or
carried them on</hi>) by other Means then is
here mentioned, I should own it <hi>a piece
of Impudence</hi> to desire <hi>your Company a
third Time;</hi> or had I pretended Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to you, and yet play'd the Knave
with <hi>Dick</hi>—(for I did not take his Room
from Week to Week, as he falsly Asserts,
<hi>but for as long as my Sale lasted,</hi> as several
Witnesses will Depose upon Oath) 'twou'd

but though I am <hi>able to stand the
Test with the same Allowance that every Man
would wish for himself under the like Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,

as well as other Men (two of a

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59888:28"/>
wonder if I had not, <hi>for I have Printed Six

                           <p>Or else such <hi>narrow Souls as are wholly

I know not of one Enemy I have in the

but Gentlemen, if I find out more, you
shall know the Names their God-fathers
gave them; but 'twill be Time enough to

and then I'll surely do it, in a <hi>Farewel

                           </p>
                           <p>Now Gentlemen, if my Friend <hi>Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell</hi>
thinks himself injur'd by these Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
<hi>the Press is open,</hi> to him I mean,
but not to me (as he has order'd it) But
<hi>if I have a clear Stage, I desire no Quarter
from him,</hi> for I have yet so much by me;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59888:28"/>
which will keep Cold, as would make a
PEDLAR Sweat, or as stout a Man as the
great <hi>Campbell.</hi> But Gentlemen, <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
makes Cowards of us all, and for that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
Campbell <hi>will scarce give you the Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of a Paper War.</hi> No, <hi>Patrick</hi> is a great
Man, and to scorn my Charge (as in Ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdays
<hi>Flying Post</hi>) is the easiest way to
Answer it; <hi>the truly Valiant dare face their
Danger,</hi> but I doubt my Enemy won't
meet me with any Weapon but his old
one of <hi>Niff-Naff,</hi> for fear his Defence in
Print, should move me to new Discoveries,
or <hi>to fall to Writing of Ears; but if he hangs

let him do it while I'm here, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
it with his <hi>right Name, as I will my
Reply with</hi> John Dunton; for 'tis a pitiful
Cowardize that strikes a Man in the dark,
or like <hi>T. W.</hi> bites a Man by the Heel,
and then like a Serpent creeps into his
Hole again, for want of Courage to abet
his Actions. <hi>I never in my whole Life was
the first Agressor in any Quarrel, but when I
am justly provok'd, I wear my Pen as others
do their Sword; and if</hi> Campbell <hi>Replies

                              <hi>But whither does my just Resentment carry
me?</hi> Yet Gentlemen, I hope you'll Pardon
it, for when at any Time I go out of the

than over-sight; there be Pieces in</hi> Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,

you to it, you will find daily in my Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Bills that I have yet divers good Books,
as <hi>Doctor</hi> Barrow's <hi>Works,</hi> Josephus <hi>History
in</hi> English, Rawleigh <hi>the best Editiion,</hi> Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's
<hi>Political Works, and many others I han't
Time to mention.</hi>

                              <pb n="31" facs="tcp:59888:29"/>
You will also find, I have several Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<hi>Law Books</hi> in all Volumes, such as
the <hi>Irish Statutes in Folio, and the Year Books
of the best Edition,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>I have also in this <hi>Third</hi> Auction, <hi>A Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of scarce Pamphlets</hi> on most Subjects,
and when my Catalogue of <hi>Manuscripts</hi> is
Publish'd (it containing great variety of
Curious Subjects never yet in Print) I
shan't doubt the <hi>Company of ingenuous
Persons,</hi> but this being my last Sale for
the Year, 1698. and my Time of Imbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quing
for <hi>London</hi> being very soon, I can
allow but <hi>Two Days after the Auction is end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
for the taking away what you Buy in
it.</p>
                           <p>To Conclude, I told you in my <hi>first Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that I thought it unjust to advance the Rate
upon you by any Vnder-hand Bidding, and
for every Penny I got that way, I'd restore a
Pound;</hi> which was not said to serve a turn,
for I have been true to my Word, as a
Worthy Member of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
(who has been a great Encourager
of my <hi>Auction</hi>) has done me the Honour
to Declare; and as <hi>honest Dobbs,</hi> a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

my <hi>Auction,</hi> can Testifie; but surely Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,

                     </opener>
                     <p>I Am sorry that I have happen'd to be
<hi>too true a Prophet.</hi> I told you in my
Last, that I foresaw you would meet with
<hi>Opposition,</hi> and that too from those of your
own Way of Business, but I could scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have thought that any Man who calls
himself a Christian, would have attempted
it in such a mean and scandalous Method.</p>
                     <p>Your <hi>Adversary</hi> may perhaps have <hi>read
the Ten Commandment;</hi> but it would seem
he hath altogether forgot the Last, or at
least to put it in Practice; seeing he had
so little Conscience as fraudulently to take
<hi>your Auction-Room over your Head.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
he may think 'twas but a just Repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zal
to over-bid you, on pretence that you
had under-sold him, which though it had
been so, is contrary to the Law of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
which forbids <hi>Rewarding Evil for
Evil.</hi> But I don't see the least pretence
he had for it. You were not the first that
set up an Auction in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and it seems
<hi>Patrick Campbel</hi> resolved you should not be
the last, seeing he follow'd your Example,
and slily <hi>bought you out of your Room,</hi> but
had that been dispos'd of by way of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
too, I am apt to think, you would
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59888:31"/>
have been able to Cope with him, either
for Purse, or in offering a fair Price.</p>
                     <p>By what I can perceive, <hi>your Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
Courage and Christianity are both of a
Piece.</hi> He was resolv'd to fight you, but
that he might assure himself of the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
he would first disarm you, or at least
make sure of the longest Weapon. Like
another <hi>Guy Faux,</hi> he undermin'd your <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction-house;</hi>
and then, like an <hi>Almanzor,</hi> he
Huffs and Braves you.</p>
                     <p>Truth did never yet of it's own Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
affect a <hi>lurking-Hole,</hi> but has always
Courage enough to stand the Test. Had
<hi>Patrick</hi>'s Practise been open and fair, He
would never have hinder'd it's being Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
in Print. There were other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
to be taken for vindicating his Fame,
than <hi>threatening your Printers,</hi> and out-bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
you there too: Had you advanc'd any
Falshoods, the Law was open; but <hi>Patrick</hi>
thought it safer to Silence the Press. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Cock is stout on his own Dunghil,</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick
<hi>Claims a Priviledge to Crow at</hi> Dublin,
but he cannot hinder you to Answer him
at <hi>London,</hi> so as you may be heard beyond
St. <hi>George's Channel;</hi> and I am apt to
think he will take no great Pleasure in
hearing the Story related.</p>
                     <p>I am glad to find you retain <hi>your Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,</hi>
and are not to be frighted into any
thing that's <hi>Sneaking</hi> by your Adversaries
big Looks or Words. <hi>Your natural Temper

                           </gap>ffords you Strength enough to bear up against
greater Attacks than those;</hi> and if it want a
Support, you know it is to be found in
him who always Patronizes a Just Cause.
Though you be now at a distance from
your <hi>well-furnish'd Closet,</hi> there's no want
of proper Helps in your present <hi>Auction</hi>-Room.
<hi>Brooks</hi>'s <hi>Remedies against Satan's
Devices,</hi> may be a proper Book for you to
consult on this Occasion. I am glad to
hear that <hi>my former,</hi> has contributed any
thing to fortifie you against this Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
I am of Opinion, your Adversary
will have no occasion to Triumph, when
he casts up his Accounts, either with <hi>his
own Conscience</hi> (if it be his Custom to keep
a fair Reckoning there) or when he comes
to count his Gains by his <hi>Envious Auction,</hi>
which fastens the brand of foul Guilt upon
him. But it seems <hi>Patrick</hi> has a Mind to
be the <hi>sole Bookseller</hi> and <hi>Auctioneer</hi> in <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi>
at what Rate soever.</p>
                     <p>I am much surpriz'd at the <hi>meanness of
his Temper in talking of lending you Forty
Shillings,</hi> which to be sure he knew you
could not want, when you brought such
a <hi>Cargo of Books</hi> with you, though you had
not had a good Estate in <hi>England</hi> to depend
upon. I question very much, whether
<hi>Patrick</hi>'s <hi>Estate</hi> be able to ballance yours,
and I am satisfied he cannot be a better
Husband than you are known to be; nor
more Industrious in his Calling; but
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59888:32"/>
                        <hi>Malice and Covetousness</hi> in one Man, (and
indeed they are seldom to be found asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
are enough to <hi>transform him into a
Monster,</hi> and by your Character of <hi>Patrick,</hi>
I can form no other Idea of him, but that
he is one of the worst sort. <hi>His Pretensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to Conscience</hi> on the one Hand, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
no Conscience of depriving you of
your <hi>Auction-Room,</hi> and bespattering your
Reputation on the other, are very becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Man who can <hi>sell one Book for two, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
different Titles.</hi> So that <hi>Patrick</hi> it seems
<hi>is a Saint on one side, and a Devil on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi>
and can shew himself in various
Shapes, as occasion requires: I am Glad you
were aware of his Tricks, and did not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
him to <hi>Gull your Library,</hi> though there's
no doubt, his disappointment in that, is one
of the Chief Causes of the base Treatment
you meet with at his Hands.</p>
                     <p>I am very well pleas'd, that the <hi>other
Dublin-Booksellers</hi> behaved themselves with
more Candour and Generosity towards
you, and that the whole Mass was not
corrupted by <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Envy.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Questions</hi> you propose to him, and
the odd hints you give of his Practice, I
hope are founded upon good Information:
otherwise, I would not advise you to Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
them; lest they be <hi>thought Envious,</hi>
and may detract from your own Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
instead of painting him in his true
Colours; but if the Things be known,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59888:33"/>
and that the divulging of 'em are necessary
for your own Vindication, I have the less
to say against it. <hi>It is fit an Hypocrite should
be discovered to the World, that he may be
render'd uncapable of deceiving more.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I cannot however approve of your <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
Reflections,</hi> for you know there are
Good and Bad in all Countries; and it
may perhaps be ill resented, if ever you
should attempt an <hi>Auction at</hi> Edinburgh,
as you seem to Design.</p>
                     <p>It's true, you have Provocation enough
from <hi>Patrick</hi> to display his <hi>Personal Faults,
for I perceive he is not so open hearted as you
are,</hi> but works like a Mole under Ground,
and undermines you with very much Art.
Were his Industry and Management right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
applied, he would deserve a Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation;
but as it is otherwise, the more
Industrious and Dexterous he is, the more
he discovers his Wickedness. <hi>Your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
him when he does well, gives an Air
of Ingenuity and Truth to the whole of your Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation;</hi>
and I am verily persuaded, that
if any part of it be a Lie, it's none of your
making—And seeing you offer to prove
the Truth of every Thing, if <hi>Patrick</hi> dares
to contradict it, I must needs say, it's a
fair offer, but inauspicious for <hi>Patrick;</hi> for
go which way it will, he's like to come
off with the Loss. If he does not Answer
you, he seems to own the Truth of your
Charge; so that were he of my Temper,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59888:33"/>
                        <hi>he would rather Venture to try it out with you,</hi>
for he can but come off with loss at last.</p>
                     <p>I am glad you have so many <hi>Witnesses
to prove the fairness of your Proceedings,</hi> for
they are as many to fasten the Guilt upon
<hi>Patrick</hi> and <hi>Dick;</hi> and therefore I plainly
see through the Reason of <hi>Patrick</hi>'s un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingness
to engage you in Print; he is
better at the <hi>short Dagger of Calumny and
Reproach behind your Back, than at fair Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
Face to Face; he's for underhand Buying,
and underhand Fighting:</hi> Yet he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that <hi>Guy Faux</hi> was at last blown
up by his own dark Lanthorn.</p>
                     <p>I must Confess, that your having Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>so many Books as you mention,</hi> is very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary;
and it had been a Miracle, if
you could have escap'd <hi>without Reflections</hi>
from one or other upon that very Account;
and therefore you have Reason to bear with
the <hi>common Fate of those of your Trade, who
Print for Authors of different Iudgments;</hi>
wherein you have scarcely had a common
Share, for I dare venture to say it, that
there are <hi>few of the Calling,</hi> but have more
Enemies than your self. I never heard of
any you had before, and therefore you
have Reason to boast, if you have but one
or two in Three Kingdoms.</p>
                     <p>I must needs approve your Design of
<hi>Printing your Defence</hi> when you come to
<hi>England,</hi> since <hi>Patrick</hi> it seems has the <hi>sole
Priviledge of the Press in</hi> Ireland; but if
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59888:34"/>
you do, be sure to keep within due bounds,
and don't make use of all the Advantage,
which <hi>the goodness of your Cause</hi> puts in your
Hand, though I think you have little need
of this Caution; you have promised your
<hi>Adversary generous Treatment,</hi> and I never
yet knew you worse than your Word.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Patrick</hi> don't Reply, it must be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he cannot, for that <hi>Advertisement</hi>
which you mention of his in the <hi>Flying
Post,</hi> is sufficient to shew that he would
if he could; and if that be the Issue, then
you have Reason to Crow over him in
<hi>England,</hi> as he Insulted you in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
But one Thing I would advise you against,
be not two Voluminous. There are but
few, who will be at the Pains to read a
<hi>large Relation of a particular Quarrel;</hi> and
therefore, I would advise you to set Bounds
to your Fancy. Your Credit is well enough
Establish'd in <hi>England,</hi> and I don't find that
you have done <hi>any Thing to lessen it in</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
so that a short Defence will serve. Nay
I am of Opinion, that a <hi>plain Narrative of
Matter of Fact,</hi> will be Apology enough for
your Self, and Punishment enough for <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick
Campbel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Copy of your Letter to the Printer,</hi> is
so fair and generous, that nothing can be
said more, to prove that your Adversary
has neither <hi>Candour nor Courage;</hi> if he don't
allow the Printer to accept your offer; but
by what I can guess of the Mans Temper,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59888:34"/>
you are neither to expect that, nor any
thing else that is fair from him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
therefore a <hi>Victory</hi> over such an Adversary
is scarce worth the contending for.</p>

                           <p>WHEREAS in the Flying Post
Reprinted at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
<hi>November</hi> the 7th 1698. There is a
Lying Advertisement, subscribed by <hi>Rich.
Pue.</hi> (who is made the <hi>Cats Foot</hi> by <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick
Campbell</hi>) without either Sense or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence,
which runs thus: <hi>Whereas it is
Published by Mr.</hi> Richard Wilde, <hi>in Mr.</hi>
John Dunton<hi>'s Advertisement of the second
of</hi> November, <hi>That the</hi> Auction-Room
<hi>was taken over his Head,</hi> &amp;c. This indeed
Mr. <hi>Wilde</hi> has not only Published, but is
ready to prove by several Witnesses, as
he has already done to Mr. <hi>Pue</hi>'s Face:
To this Mr. <hi>Pue</hi> (according to his usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Modesty) answers, <hi>That the Report is
False and Malicious, for Mr.</hi> Wilde <hi>is not
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59888:36"/>
the Person that did take the</hi> House: Mr.
<hi>Wilde</hi> never said he did; nor had <hi>Dick</hi>
wrong'd me (if he had also added (when
his Hand was in) nor Mr. <hi>Dunton</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
for I took only the <hi>Auction-Room:</hi>
But this is either according to <hi>Dick's Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding;</hi>
or else one of <hi>Patrick's</hi> Jesui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Equivocations to creep out at: The
Sense of which is, <hi>That the</hi> Auction-Room
<hi>was not taken over Mr.</hi> Wilde's <hi>Head, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is not the Person that took the House:</hi>
Now where the Coherence of this is, he
that knows can tell. But though Mr.
<hi>Wilde</hi> did not take the House, yet Mr.
<hi>Pue</hi> promis'd him the Refusal of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction-Room,</hi>
when my <hi>Auction</hi> was done,
which <hi>Dick</hi> has not only own'd, but told
Mr. <hi>Campbel</hi> as much. To this <hi>Dick</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
wisely says <hi>nothing,</hi> because he has <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>
to the Purpose to say. As to my
self, he tells <hi>two Notorious Vntruths:</hi> One
is, That I took his <hi>Auction-Room</hi> only from
<hi>Week</hi> to <hi>Week;</hi> whereas I took it during
the whole Time of the Sale of my <hi>Three
Auctions,</hi> paying 5<hi>s. per</hi> Week while I
kept it. This I can prove by <hi>two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
upon Oath.</hi> The other Untruth is,
That I gave him notice the beginning of
<hi>October,</hi> that I should have done by the
end of that Month; whereas he himself,
not long since, confess'd before several
Witnesses, That I <hi>took it during the whole
Sale of my</hi> Auctions, and that I never Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leas'd
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59888:36"/>
him. This he did so lately, he
can't forget it: And he that will put his
Name to so Notorious a Lye, and <hi>know it
to be so,</hi> (which is <hi>Dick</hi>'s Case,) may
well be suppos'd to scruple nothing.—As
to what he says of <hi>Patrick</hi>'s <hi>being so
Cautious of taking the Room over my Head,</hi>
it is like a Man's asking his. Fellow whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be a Thief. And for his saying, that
<hi>Campbel scorns my Reflections;</hi> I believe
'tis the wisest Course he can take; for I
am sure it is far easier to <hi>scorn 'em,</hi> then
answer 'em. But though he scorus 'em,
<hi>Vnderstanding Men</hi> will see what weight,
as well as what Truth there is in 'em: To
whose Impartial Judgment I submit 'em.

was Necessary and Just, and <hi>Patrick</hi>'s pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59888:38"/>
your Publishing <hi>your Reasons</hi> in
Print, according to his usual sly Manner,
is Argument enough to prove that he durst
not refer his Cause to the Determination
of the Publick; and indeed I do not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at it, for Injustice may well be asham'd
to show its Face. Besides, it seems its
<hi>Patrick's Character, to work like a Mole under
Ground; for though he Loves to Act Vnjustly,
he does not Love to Appear so.</hi> It's the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a Hypocrite to wear a Rough Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to deceive.</p>
                     <p>It was the next, and the only Course
left you, to Publish <hi>your Advertisement,</hi>
that <hi>Patrick</hi> might a little appear in his
Colours, and in the mean Time to Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
<hi>your Reasons in Writing,</hi> was an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of true <hi>English</hi> Courage, to Face
your Adversary <hi>with such Weapons as you
could come at,</hi> when your Cowardly Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
had depriv'd you of any other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he knew he durst not engage you on
Equal Terms.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>His Publishing a Reflection upon you in the
Reprinted Flying Post,</hi> was another Effect
of his dastardly Temper, seeing he would
not allow you the same Liberty; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Mr. <hi>Wilde's Advertisement</hi> against
<hi>Campbel</hi> and <hi>Dick</hi> was very proper and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary;
nothing could more effectually
vindicate your Honesty, and prove your
Adversaries falshood, and unfair way of
Dealing; and I doubt not, but the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59888:38"/>
would take it, as a sufficient Proof of
it.</p>
                     <p>Your <hi>own Answer too</hi> was highly necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and in my Opinion very pertinent:
You therein expose <hi>Patricks and Dicks Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical
Equivocations to the Life,</hi> and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Mr. <hi>Wilde</hi> seconded the Truth of your
Assertions, by his Advertisement, and that
you so boldly offer to prove the Truth of
what you Assert in yours, its next to prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Patrick a Liar on Record.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I am far from questioning the Truth of
what you have from Time to Time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
me of as to the <hi>Dublin Scuffle,</hi> and
should have believ'd it on your own Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
I have not known you so long, but
that I am very well satisfied, you were
never taken for a Liar at home, and I have
no Reason to think you have chang'd your
Temper by going to <hi>Ireland.</hi> However,
your Prudence and Caution is commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

justifie my own Innocence; and to bring
him, if possible (according to the Scotch
Phrase) <hi>to the stool of Repentance. I</hi> am
pleas'd, to hear your Lordship is not angry
at my Intention herein; and as the <hi>Speaker
of the House of Commons,</hi> has done me the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
to desire a sight of my first Draught,
in Manuscript; so your Lordship has
likewise been pleas'd to Honour me, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59888:40"/>
a sight of the same, in Print; <hi>which
as it obliges me to Publish nothing but real
Truth;</hi> so it encourages me to hope, That
the <hi>Publishing</hi> my <hi>Dublin Scuffle,</hi> will bring
<hi>Campbell</hi> to a sense of his Error. <hi>I</hi> have
only to beg your Lordship's Pardon for this
Presumption, and to assure your Lordship,
that <hi>I</hi> am,</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>I Was sufficiently Satisfied by your Last,
that your Justice, in relation to the
Controversie betwixt <hi>Patrick Campbell,</hi> and
your Self, was undeniable; and therefore
the further Testimonies which you have
now sent me of it, are <hi>ex Superabandanti;</hi>
but I confess, the Quality of 'em is such,
that you ought not to have omitted them;
especially when you had seemingly trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress'd
the <hi>Rules of Good Breeding</hi> so far,
as to trouble such an Eminent Person as
the <hi>Lord Bishop of Clogher,</hi> with a Letter
on that Subject.</p>
                     <p>It was indeed a necessary Piece of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
and an Acknowledgment due to
the <hi>Bishop's Character and Personal Merit,</hi> to
return his Lordship Thanks for the Incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59888:41"/>
he had given to your Auction,
and it was no less than Justice to the <hi>Clergy
of Ireland,</hi> to own their Generous Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the Countenance they gave to
your Undertaking; but I cannot altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
approve of your troubling that Great
<hi>Prelate,</hi> who has the Charge of so many
Weighty Affairs upon his Shoulders, with
such a Minute Affair as you <hi>Scuffle with
Patrick Campbel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But seeing his Lordship was so kind as
to take your <hi>Presumption in good part,</hi> and
has been so condescending as to give you
such a <hi>generous Testimony of the Fairness of
your dealing in your</hi> Auction: I cannot but
admire the Excellency of his Lordships
Temper, and applaud your successful
boldness.</p>
                     <p>You and your Friend Mr. <hi>Wilde</hi> have
Reason to Value your selves upon the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of a Person of so great Worth,
which to be sure will give a <hi>Reputation</hi> to
your Management with all Men of Sense
and Honour; for I cannot but think, that
the <hi>Testimony of a Bishop and Privy Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,</hi>
will infinitely out-weigh the Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of a <hi>Pedlar</hi> turn'd <hi>Bookseller,</hi> and his
Tool a <hi>Coffee-man.</hi> Besides, the Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which his Lordship has for his Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Piety, makes it evident, that he
look'd upon your Design as very subservi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to the Interest of Learning in that
Kingdom; seeing he gave so much Incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="55" facs="tcp:59888:41"/>
What you say of bringing <hi>Patrick</hi> to the
<hi>Stool of Repentance,</hi> has something of an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety
in it, except you suppose him to
have been <hi>Cock-Baud</hi> to your <hi>Dorinda,</hi> for
that Pennance is not (as I am inform'd)
injoin'd in his Countrey upon any but
those who are guilty of <hi>Vncleanness</hi>—But
perhaps, because <hi>Patrick</hi> may have a
<hi>Dorinda,</hi> which he may Love as himself;
you may think that he ought to mount
the <hi>Stool of Repentance</hi> for h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r <hi>Billet Douxes.</hi>
If this be your meaning, I wish you had
let it alone, for I am afraid if that Custom
should take Place, it might bring a great
many of your Acquaintance in <hi>England</hi> to
stand in a <hi>White Sheet</hi> for the Faults of
their She-Friends; and I know you are so
good natur'd, that you would not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wish them so much harm.</p>
                     <p>It's true, that you for your own Part
have been happier than many. <hi>Your first
Wifes Vertue put Her beyond the reach of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicion,
and that of your second is Vnattack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;</hi>
but though you and they have been
mutually happy in one another, so that
you had no occasion for a <hi>She-Friend,</hi> yet
you ought to consider that there are many
of your Acquaintance that have not had so
good a Fate.</p>
                     <p>However, as to your Adversary <hi>Patrick,</hi>
whether he deserve the <hi>Stool of Repentance</hi>
for his own personal Crimes or not, I
know not; but this I am sure of, that if
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59888:42"/>
the Character given of him be true, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
an <hi>Advancement of as Publick a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
and something like the other too;
for as the <hi>Stool of Repentance</hi> in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
is rais'd so high, that the Criminal
who is plac'd upon it may be seen by all
that are in the Church; he seems to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
to be elevated above his Brethren <hi>in
a Publick Market-place,</hi> with a Hole for his
Head, and one for each Hand, and to have
the Title Page of <hi>Hodder transform'd into
Cocker,</hi> &amp;c. Nail'd over his Head.</p>
                     <p>But to return to your <hi>Scuffle.</hi> Your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
that Affair to the <hi>Lord Bishop of</hi>
Clogher, <hi>and the Speaker of the</hi> House of
Commons, seems to be a very good <hi>Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matur;</hi>
but at the same Time, it is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
upon you to take Care, that there
be nothing in it, <hi>too mean to deserve such a
License,</hi> and that may be unfit for one of
your Business and Reputation to divulge;
for though, I doubt not, but you will <hi>keep
Religiously to Truth;</hi> yet you know that all
the Truth is not to be spoken at all Times,
and somethings may be <hi>too Trifling</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the View of the Publick; therefore
peruse every Thing carefully before it be
Printed off. You see I make use of my
<hi>wonted Freedom</hi> with you, as becomes one
who is</p>

                           <p>THough my <hi>Three Auctions</hi> are now

left, so I design to try your generous Bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a <hi>Fourth Time,</hi> which I'll call my
<hi>Farewel Sale.</hi> It shall begin the following
<hi>Monday</hi> at Three in the Afternoon at <hi>Patt</hi>'s
<hi>Coffee-House</hi> in <hi>High-street,</hi> and shall end
<hi>December</hi> the first, neither will I exceed
that, resolving (God-willing) to Embark
for <hi>London December 5th.</hi> 'Tis true I have
Books enough to continue the Sale much
longer, but <hi>Native Countrey</hi> has Charms in
it, and I am very desirous to be at home:
And therefore <hi>December 5th, I shall bid you
all Farewel:</hi> for though when my <hi>Fourth
Sale</hi> is over, I shall still have Quantities
left, yet all that is then remaining <hi>I'll lump
to the Booksellers of</hi> Dublin (to whom you
must give <hi>higher Rates,</hi> of which the Sale
of the <hi>French Book of Martyrs,</hi> is a late In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance)
or if we can't agree, the same
Ship that brought 'em hither, will be able
to carry 'em back.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Conditions</hi> of this last Sale are, That
whatever is bought till <hi>Thursday</hi> Night, be

what has been bought in my <hi>Three past Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi>
'tis expected they should be all fetcht

<hi>Patrick</hi> will <hi>Publickly own the Publick Injury

<hi>Patrick Campbel,</hi> and forget his <hi>Taking my

                           <p>WE whose Names are hereunto Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,
being all of us Present at
Mr. <hi>Iohn Dunton</hi>'s <hi>Three Auctions</hi> in <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi>
and having seen the Management
thereof every Day; do hereby <hi>Attest,</hi>
That as all was carried on and Managed
with the greatest Candour and Sincerity
imaginable, by Mr. <hi>Dunton,</hi> so the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of those Gentlemen that bought his
Books, have acknowledged in our hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
That they had all the fair Dealing
that they could desire: And we can more
particularly affirm, That Mr. <hi>Dunton</hi>'s
<hi>Demeanour during his whole</hi> Auctions, has
been such, as has given Content to all
Gentlemen there: For whereas in other
<hi>Auctions</hi> it is common to have <hi>Setters</hi> to
raise the value of the Books, in Mr. <hi>Dunton</hi>'s
Auction we are sure there was none, <hi>from
the beginning to the end: Mr.</hi> Dunton ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
absolutely declar'd against it, <hi>as not
fair nor honest.</hi> And we do further At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,
to our certain Knowledge, That in
all his Concernments, with the <hi>Printers,
Stationers, Binders,</hi> and others (which
was very considerable) he paid every
one, not only to a <hi>Penny,</hi> but even to a
<hi>single Half-Penny,</hi> so very exact and scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59888:44"/>
he was of wronging them. And
as to the <hi>several Places</hi> where the said Mr.
<hi>Dunton</hi> lodg'd, he not only paid his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
according to Agreement, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
gratify'd 'em for any Trouble that
was extraordinary, by <hi>Sickness,</hi> or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
And that in all his said Lodgings,
his way of Living was so inoffensive and
blameless, that he was (as <hi>Caesar</hi> would
have had his Wife) not only <hi>free from
blame, but from all Suspicion</hi> of it. And as
to the <hi>Controversie</hi> he has had with Mr.
<hi>Patrick Campbel,</hi> we do hereby Attest,
That Mr. <hi>Campbel</hi> was altogether the
Aggressor; for though Mr. <hi>Campbel</hi> had
us'd Mr. <hi>Dunton very Barbarously</hi> at his
first coming over, yet Mr. <hi>Dunton</hi> took
no notice of it, till <hi>Campbel</hi> had <hi>Taken his</hi>
Auction-Room <hi>over his Head, by offering a
double Price</hi> (as <hi>Dick</hi> the Coffee-man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
in our hearing) and yet even then
Mr. <hi>Dunton</hi> was so fair, as to offer to
close his <hi>Auctions</hi> in <hi>one Weeks Time</hi> more,
provided he might tarry in it so long,
though he had then <hi>Two Hundred Pounds
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>orth of Books</hi> to Sell, and that he would
<hi>Lump</hi> the Remainder; which <hi>Campbel</hi>
absolutely refused. And notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such his refusal, yet we do Attest,
That Mr. <hi>Dunton</hi> has been so favourable
to the said <hi>Campbel,</hi> that he has not rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
those ill Things of him which he
might have done; and which he was urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59888:45"/>
by <hi>several Persons</hi> to do. Nor is there
any thing Mr. <hi>Dunton</hi> has said of him,
but what to <hi>our Knowledge</hi> he has divers
Witnesses to prove it, if there be occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

                     <p>I Am sorry to find that <hi>Patrick is not yet
reduc'd to Reason,</hi> though I think there's
no great Cause to wonder at it, for I am
apt to think his <hi>Reason and Religion,</hi> are
much of a Piece. I am glad however,
that his Malice proves Toothless, or that
at best it is <hi>worn to the stumps.</hi> It is but
just, that dishonesty should be unsuccess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
though many Times we see the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
Providence order it otherwise, for a
while at least.</p>
                     <p>Your <hi>Farewel Sale</hi> demonstrates your
Courage and Honesty, in that you durst
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59888:46"/>
Appeal to the <hi>Publick, and</hi> Patricks <hi>own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi>
for the Justice of your Cause. The
offer you made him of suppressing your <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
Narrative or Character of him,</hi> if he
would publickly own the Injury he did
you, is highly Generous; considering how
much you had been a loser by it. There
are few Men, but would have <hi>demanded
Restitution as well as Repentance,</hi> but I don't
find that <hi>Patrick</hi> is so good a Christian as
to offer you either; and therefore, I think
no Man can justly blame you for exposing
him in his own Colours to the View of the
World, according to your Promise: But be
sure to keep a steady Hand; for though I
am of Opinion, you can scarcely miss such
ugly and course Features; yet, you know
the Proverb, <hi>Give the Devil his due,</hi> includes
a good Lesson of Morality in it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I hope you will represent him no
worse than he really is. I must needs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
tell you, that unless you be satisfied in
your own Conscience, that it is necessary
to do this for the Defence of your own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
you will run a <hi>great hazard of
breaking the Ninth Commandment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Proposals</hi> you make to your Buyers
in your <hi>Farewel Sale,</hi> are Just and Reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and a Proof at the same time that you
design'd no Injury to your <hi>Brethren the
Booksellers</hi> by your <hi>Auction,</hi> seeing you are
willing to let them have <hi>Lumping Penny-worths
at Last,</hi> that they may be Sharers
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59888:46"/>
in the Profit of your Book-Adventure, as
well as others.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Attestation</hi> of your Friends, it
was kind in them to offer it, and necessary
for you to have it. I question much whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Patrick</hi> can produce the like Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
in any Respect.</p>
                     <p>Your <hi>Precaution</hi> in this Matter is very
commendable, for you have thereby in
my Opinion stop'd the Mouths of all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villers,
as to <hi>every Part of your Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
since you arriv'd in</hi> Dublin; and in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>

by this <hi>Attestation,</hi> that <hi>Patrick</hi> was the

Publishing of this, and some other of the
most <hi>remarkable Passages of</hi> Patrick's <hi>Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,</hi>
were enough to blacken him, and
to vindicate you in the Eyes of all Honest

Sale</hi> are now ended, yet I have
still quantities of Books left, which (for

Rates;</hi> (the Sale to begin <hi>Tuesday De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi>
the 13th in the Morning, and to
end the same Evening.) Gentlemen, I
shan't sell these remaining Books by <hi>way
of Auction,</hi> but at such easie Rates as shall
be agreed upon <hi>between</hi> Mr. Wilde <hi>and the
Buyer.</hi> 'Tis true, when I consider, I had
no Setter in any of my <hi>Four Sales,</hi> I could
not have thought that any would have been
<hi>so Vnjust as to Buy what they won't Pay for;
but I was mistaken!</hi> But (to the Honour of
the <hi>Tribe of</hi> Levi) no Clergy-man in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
has treated me in this Manner: I
mention this, that the World may see I
design'd no Reflection on those <hi>Learned
Gentlemen,</hi> in my Advertisement of <hi>Iuly</hi> the
9th, for though the Enemies of my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
wrested my Words to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
yet nothing was ever further from
my Thoughts; for besides that I my self
have the <hi>Honour</hi> to be the <hi>Son of a Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>

telling you (a <hi>second Time</hi>) that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
I have with an excessive Charge
brought over the best Collection of valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Books that ever was exposed in this
Kingdom, and have treated both in my
Catalogues, and otherwise, my Brethren
in this City, and the rest of Mankind,
with the greatest Respect and Civility;
and been so just to them, as not in the
least to employ any Setter (in any of my
Four Sales) but wholly to submit my
large Venture to the <hi>Mercy, Candour, and
Generosity</hi> of the Bidders: Yet after all this
Fair Play for their Money, I understand,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59888:48"/>
such hath been the Practice of some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
(from some of whom better usage
might be expected, considering their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
in the World) as maliciously and
ignorantly to discourage those Worthy
Gentlemen and Clergy-men that were
disposed to furnish themselves with Good
Books. Gentlemen, this usage is unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
any thing of a Christian, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> who by his setting up for a Bante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
contrary to Christianity, spoils his
Neighbours fair Market; making good
what <hi>Solomon</hi> so long ago observ'd, <hi>It is
naught, it is naught, saith the Buyer, but
when he is gone, he boasteth.</hi> This is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to give Notice to the World, That as
I Act upon the Fairest and Justest Bottom
that can be, in this last Sale, which I call
the <hi>Packing Penny,</hi> so I am resolved to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
my Proceedings; and in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
if I can have but good Proof, that
either without Doors, but more especially
at my Sale, of any Persons, that shall take

                        <pb n="73" facs="tcp:59888:50"/>

of Passion, for that may be a snare
laid to gain an Advantage against you,
either by an Action at Law, or blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
your Reputation.</p>
                     <p>I approve your Diligence and Ingenuity
in promoting the Sale of your Books, but
am sorry you have met with such as Buy
and don't Pay. I am glad to find howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
that though you had so much unfair
dealing from others, you have found the
Clergy Just in their Bargains, and that
you vindicate your self from having refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
upon them in your Advertisement of
<hi>Iuly 9th.</hi> This is a Time, when every
Man, that has any value for the Christian
Religion, should be very tender in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
on the Clergy; and indeed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Conceal their real Faults, than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
them on the House-tops; and much
less utter groundless Suspicions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> against
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59888:51"/>
them. You are oblig'd particularly both
by Parentage, and the Profession of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
you make, to be very careful in this
Matter; and therefore, I am glad to find
you so sensible of your Duty in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect—The
old Barbarous Verse of <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteri
nati raro solent esse Beati,</hi> is as far from
Truth as good Latin: Though those who
are Enemies to the Order, may please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with the Reflection, the common
Experience of Mankind demonstrates the
falshood of it; for if the number of Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
Children be compar'd with those of
others, and their Morals, Religion, and
Success in the World, laid in the Ballance
with those of the Children of other Ranks
of Men, it will appear to have been a
meer Forgery of those who were against
the Marriage of Priests of Old; and lick'd
up and improved by such, who if not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,
are at least Crafty under-hand Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to the Christian Religion.</p>
                     <p>I wish from my Heart that all Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
themselves took more Care to obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
this Reflection, by a careful looking
after their own Practise, and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
Education; and then the Injustice
of it would be more apparent. And I am
sorry to find, that tho the <hi>Irish</hi> Clergy
have been just to their Bargains, that yet
any one of 'em should have taken indirect
Measures to injure you in your <hi>Auctions,</hi>
but they are earthen Vessels as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59888:51"/>
Therefore I would advise you not
to be sharp in your Resentments upon
them. Some of your Books might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
be disrelishing to them, but that was
their fault. Your design was to serve the
Interest of Learning in general, and not to
please every Mans humour, which you
knew was impossible.</p>
                     <p>You Vindication of those concern'd in
your <hi>Auctions</hi> from having any share in
what you Printed against <hi>Campbel,</hi> is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and just—and no less can be said of
Mr. <hi>Wilde</hi>'s Advertisement' concerning
the design of an <hi>Auction</hi> of his own, and
publickly avowing <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Injustice to
you, which makes it so notorious, that
I think there is the less need of your Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
much more about it. I am</p>

                     <p>I Have received yours with the Copy of
Mr. <hi>Campbel</hi>'s Letter, proposing a
Meeting and Reference.</p>
                     <p>Sir, This <hi>Proposal of</hi> Campbel's is cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and Picquant enough, and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
what I always thought, that he is
a Crafty Intriguing Man. It carries an
Air of Religion and Ingenuity at first
view; but by the Railing mixt through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
and the Reslecting Conclusion, he
does not seem ever to have design'd any
Meeting with you; for if he had, there's
Reason to think he would have propos'd it
in fairer Terms, and not have aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Matters to incense you, if he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59888:53"/>
an Amicable Accommodation.</p>
                     <p>This may partly justifie the sharpness of
your Reply, and serving him in his own
Coin, by proposing such Terms of Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as you might reasonably think he
would never comply with: For I find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
less would serve your turn than Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Repentance; and he tells you plainly,
that he was not willing either<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> to Print or
Write himself a Liar. So that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to reconcile you. This, if <hi>Patrick</hi>
be conscious of his Guilt, argues an obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy
inconsistent with Christianity. Yet
I cannot wholly approve your Conduct,
nor Policy in your Reply. Had you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of a Meeting without any thing of
ripping up Sores, or telling him the Preli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries;
you might possibly have had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an opportunity of bringing him to a
Sense of his Fault, or of having further
Evidence against him; and indeed I see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that can excuse your oversight in
this Matter, but that Letter to Mr. <hi>Wilde</hi>
giving an Account of <hi>Patricks</hi> further ill

to Embark for <hi>England,</hi> yet I
here send a Messenger to tell you, I'll
wait an hour (to shake Hands with you)
if you'll confess the Wrongs you did, or
there were <hi>any hopes of your Penitence:</hi> And
isn't it strange, that <hi>Patrick Campbel,</hi> who
is so Religious, as to say Grace over <hi>a dish
of Coffee,</hi> should have no Qualms after
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59888:57"/>
slandering his Neighbour, or refusing to
pay his debts? I say debts, for I sent
your Account <hi>fairly stated</hi> (and prov'd you
owe me a round Sum) without receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your Answer to it. Then with what
Face, (but you suppos'd I was Ship'd off)
could you tell <hi>Bently, I was your Debter, and
refus'd to meet you before a Magistrate, or at
the</hi> Keys <hi>in</hi> High-street, where I waited
for you above an Hour? But tho' you
durst not appear then, I'm now waiting in
the Boat for you, in hopes you'll appear
at last, and to engage you to it, (if you'll
ask Pardon) I'll even here receive you
<hi>with open Arms.</hi> 'Tis true, you have given
great Provocation, and had I not been ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of you, I had long since sent you the
<hi>Length of my Sword, or as you're beneath my
Notice, some Porter to have broke your Pate.</hi>
Sir, put on your Sword, (<hi>if it be not in
trouble</hi>) and let me see your Face; for your
private slandering is very sordid, and I
am sure deserves to be soundly drubb'd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for by backbiting of me you still sneak your

Injuries:</hi> I confess, I am not so hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as this comes to, yet I forgive <hi>Patrick</hi>
with all my Heart; but Sir, I think it my
duty to Print the <hi>Scuffle</hi> you engag'd me

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59888:57"/>
so that to <hi>forget and forgive you too,</hi>
will but encourage, you to abuse others,

For save a—from the Gallows, and

<hi>burn the Scuffle,</hi> if you'll come hither, and
shake hands, and tell the World (when I

for it. 'Tis reported of St. <hi>K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

That she sucked the invenom'd Wounds of a
Fellow who had impudently wrong'd her:</hi> I don't
pretend to such flights as these; but if
you'll come to the Boat (<hi>and remember 'tis
the last Offer</hi>) and own your Errors,
I'll be more your Friend than ever I was
your Enemy: And though <hi>Pickance</hi> (the
Master of the <hi>Diamond</hi>) waits for his
Ships Crow, yet if you'll do me Justice,
I'll return to <hi>Dublin</hi> a second time, to
<hi>drink your Health,</hi> (in the first place) and
another to honest <hi>Gun, Servant, Bently,</hi>
and the rest of our Learned Brethren;
and by coming thus to Confession, you'll
cease being <hi>a Trouble to your Friends,</hi> and a
scandal to your self: But if you will not
repent, as a wounded <hi>Roman</hi> said upon <hi>a
set Challenge,</hi> the <hi>Scuffle must appear,</hi> and
shall be followed (if you dare answer it)
with the <hi>History of your Life,</hi> from the

you me that) the very hour you Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                              <pb n="88" facs="tcp:59888:58"/>
But my <hi>Scuffle</hi> is just, and without your

it; for truly, St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> I have a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Regard to my Honour than my Life:
And tho' my Arms should fail me to fight,
(they are the words of this Noble <hi>Roman</hi>)
yet my Heart still encourages me to <hi>dye

appear, and our Ship is under Sail; but if
you repent at last, (<hi>and I'll press you to it

him,</hi> and of his disappointing you again,
though the Appointment was of his own

you as much surfeited with the <hi>Scuffle,</hi> as
I am with hearing of it, you would have
given over long e're now. I don't think
it worth your while to <hi>buy</hi> Patrick's <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
at so dear</hi> a Rate, as to take so much
Pains for it. If he were truly <hi>sensible of

and how great soever his Hypoeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie

                     <p>You have, I think, over-done it, in solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing

thing, for they that know a Liar will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

however to <hi>follow Peace</hi> as much as you

that there's no hopes of Cure. <hi>Take care

Waves to deal with, within as well as
without, when you <hi>Cross the Main.</hi> You
have sufficiently prov'd him to be an ill
Man, and his declining to meet you, and
to offer what he could say in his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
seems to be <hi>a Tacit acknowledgment
of the Guilt</hi>—Nay, I may say a direct pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
it on the House-Tops, seeing he
durst not refer the <hi>Trial of his Debt</hi> to his
own Friend—and refus'd to come to a
hearing, though so often and so publickly
invited to it. All I have more to adde is,
that you <hi>have come off Conquerour,</hi> have
choak'd <hi>Patrick</hi> with one Lie upon the

qualms of Conscience before now, but
those I am afraid are reserved to another
time, and for his <hi>greater Punishment.</hi> In

to make a <hi>discrect use of your Victory,</hi> don't
discover your own Weakness in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing

                        <salute>SIR,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>YOU had in my last an Account of
the Pains Mr. <hi>Servant</hi> took to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
<hi>Patrick</hi> and I, I also sent ye my <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel-letter</hi>
to <hi>Campbel</hi> occasioned by his <hi>False
report</hi> that I durst not meet him. I next
told ye of a <hi>Second Parley</hi> I had with him,
and his Reason for not coming to the
<hi>Keys</hi> in <hi>High-street,</hi> tho 'twas a place of
his own appointment. I likewise sent you
a Letter <hi>Mr. Wild</hi> received; wherein, as I
formerly gave you the Sentiments of some
Clergy-Men upon my <hi>Scuffle</hi> with <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick;</hi>
so you there saw the Opinion of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59888:61"/>
the Citizens of <hi>Dublin</hi> upon this Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
having proceeded thus far in the <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of the</hi> Dublin <hi>Wrangle,</hi> This Letter
is, to conclude the <hi>Scuffle</hi> so far as I was
concern'd with <hi>Patrick.</hi> But the <hi>Dublin-Scuffle</hi>
did not end here, for I had no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
silenc't the <hi>Scotch Loon,</hi> but I was At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tackt
by other Enemies (perhaps some
that were set on by <hi>Patrick;</hi> for being foil'd
himself, he was willing still to be <hi>gnashing
his Teeth</hi>) who these new Enemies were,
you shall know in my next Letter, and
when you have answered that, I'll send ye
a Copy of <hi>my Last-Farewel to my Friends in</hi>
Dublin, <hi>that stood by me in ev'ry Skirmish,</hi>
and in this (as I formerly promis'd) I shall
Point at my worst Enemies; I mean those
that snarl'd at the <hi>second Spira,</hi> have been
very zealous to cut my Throat (<hi>for Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
slandering is of that Nature</hi>) or which
is worse, have Bought what they won't pay
for: And with this <hi>Farewel</hi> (to both Friends
and Enemies) I design to <hi>conclude my Scuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle;</hi>
and you'll say 'tis Time, for <hi>Patrick</hi> is
now Sick on't, and <hi>calls out for help;</hi> I mean
having done me what Mischief he can him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
he is now setting the Lawyers <hi>a Scuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
too,</hi> and next Term <hi>Iohn Dunton</hi> and
<hi>Patrick Campbel</hi> are to be the <hi>Grand Scuffle</hi>
(in the four Courts) amongst the Lawyers.
But Sir, I as little fear his Law, as he minds
the Gospel; and to convince ye of this, I
no sooner heard that <hi>Patrick had a Warrant
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59888:61"/>
for me,</hi> and was resolv'd to turn our <hi>Paper-War
into a Law-suit,</hi> but I sent to his <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
the following Letter,</p>
                     <floatingText type="letter">

SIR,</p>
                     <p>I Sent the forgoing <hi>Letter and Advertisement</hi> to
Mr. <hi>Brent,</hi> by my Friend Mr. <hi>George Larkin,</hi>
who was present with me when I sent Mr. <hi>Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi>
Word, I was then at Mr. <hi>Powels,</hi> ready to
obey his Warrant (for hearing he had a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
I was zealous to have it Executed) and to
make good my Charge against him; but <hi>Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi>
durst not appear; but notwithstanding that,
and the <hi>frequent Overtures</hi> I made of meeting
him at other Places (as Mr. <hi>Servant</hi> and others
are able to testifie) he tells <hi>Dick</hi> (as thinking
I was now Embark'd) that at the Arrival of
<hi>next Post,</hi> he intended to Write against me;
hearing by Chance of this, I sent him (<hi>though

and I not going at the Time I expected, to shew
I had <hi>no Malice against</hi> Dick, I went to bid him
Farewel; and he generously tells me, That at
the Arrival of the next Post, (<hi>that is, when I
am gone, and you think I shan't hear your Abuses</hi>)
you Design to Write against me, not consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that <hi>all the Town will fling Dirt in your Eyes,</hi>
(to use the Words of a Gentleman who heard
of it) for slandering an Innocent Person, who
when he was present, you durst not look in the

shews the badness of your Cause, and what lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

you according to your Folly,</hi> and that before I
Publish the <hi>Scuffle</hi> you have engag'd me in. Sir,
In the <hi>Dublin Scuffle,</hi> if I am treated in this Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly
Manner, shall be Printed a Key to explain
what is meant by <hi>Cocker, Cumpstey,</hi> and the
darker Passages: To which shall be added, a true
Copy, (which I have by me) of what the Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers
of <hi>Dublin</hi> Charge you with: And if you
have <hi>Courage to Answer this,</hi> you may expect a
Rejoynder, including the <hi>Ludicrous Passages</hi> of
your whole Life: (For I have Materials enough
for that Purpose) neither is the Account you
sent in Answer to the Debt you owe me, less
false or ridiculous than your other Actions; for
you make your self Debtor but for three <hi>Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
when I can produce a Letter under your
<hi>Hand,</hi> declaring you owe for seven; does my
great Civility (<hi>ungrateful Man as you are</hi>) of

of the other two?</p>
                           <p>Thus have I fairly told you what I will do,
and what the World will say, if you belie me
after I am gone: And have as fairly answer'd
the Account you sent me: Wherein my Lawyer
shall prove (<hi>since you durst not meet me whilst I
was here</hi>) that you are still about Forty Shillings
in my Debt. When your <hi>Cowardly Reflections</hi>
appear, I have order'd this to be Printed; but

SIR,</p>
                     <p>BY this <hi>Advertisement</hi> (Publish'd after I left
<hi>Ireland</hi>) you may observe Three Things.
<hi>First,</hi> Patrick's <hi>Noble Education,</hi> how finely
he Writes and Spells, for I have not alter'd a
Letter from the Copy my Friend sent me.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly, His great Cowardice,</hi> in not daring
to Publish this till I left <hi>Dublin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And Thirdly, His great Honesty</hi> in handing
privately to the World a Paper, <hi>fill'd with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Lies</hi> (as I have prov'd already, so
need not do it again) but as base as he was in
Printing such <hi>notorious Lies,</hi> when I was n't or
the Spot to disprove 'em, yet I must own to his
Honour (<hi>for he has not a Vertue, but I blaze it
abroad with greater Pleasure then I do his Vices</hi>)
that he did not Publish 'em openly, but only
caused three of 'em to be Printed off, to shew
to some particular Friends, or perhaps (as my
Friend observes) to his <hi>Beautiful Wife, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
her she had Married a Wit.</hi>

                        <salute>SIR,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>I Am Sorry that you are <hi>still haunted with Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
in</hi> Ireland, where the World hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
thought there were none. It seems <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59888:64"/>
is a Man of Interest as well as Intrigue,</hi> when
you are no sooner rid of one of his familiar
Spirits, but you are straight ways attack'd by
another; <hi>Patrick has gnash'd his Teeth,</hi> as you
word it, so long, that I wonder his Grinders are
not worn to the stumps by this Time. You
tell me you <hi>design speedily to conclude your Scuffle,</hi>
which is very well, but I am sure it had been
much better you had never begun it, or at least
that you had giv'n it over sooner. You say,
that he now <hi>threatens you with the Law,</hi> which
if he do, you are like to be a good Booty to the
Gentlemen of the <hi>Long Robe,</hi> and I dare say,
they will not <hi>turn you out for Wranglers</hi> so long
as the Cash holds; and therefore I hope <hi>Patrick</hi>
and you will be both better advis'd. I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it is only a <hi>Copy of his Countenance,</hi> for he
will be as unwilling to be Expos'd before the
<hi>Bench,</hi> as to come to the <hi>Stool of Repentance,</hi> and
in that Sense I doubt not but its true, that <hi>you
fear his Law as little as he Minds the Gospel.</hi> It's
unhappy for <hi>Patrick,</hi> that he fell upon such an
Adversary, as is <hi>ready to Answer him at all Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons.</hi>
I must needs commend your Courage,
though perhaps it had been more Prudent, and
some will say more Chirstian too, if you had
rather put up the Wrong, for there's a great
deal of Truth in that North-Countrey saying,
<hi>That its the second Blow makes the Fray.</hi> However
your own Conscience is the best Judge of your
Circumstances, and to that I leave you, as to
this Matter; but thus far I think I may venture
to say, that it is no ill Policy in you to make <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick</hi>
sensible of the Advantages you have against
him, that way too; if he have a mind to <hi>change
the Scene.</hi> It was both Generous and Christian
to offer a personal Conference, and to <hi>stand the
Test of his Warrant</hi> with which he threatned you
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59888:65"/>
and his declining it, is an Argument of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
highly defective in both Respects.</p>
                     <p>Your <hi>Letter to him from on Board,</hi> I think
(all things considered) was needful enough,
and I perceive your Pen was <hi>nothing blunted, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
you had wrote so much;</hi> your Threats
are terrible, like those of an <hi>Almanzor,</hi> and I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
you had a mind to convince <hi>Patrick</hi> of the
Truth of what you have formerly asserted, that
you <hi>Wear your Pen as others do their Sword;</hi> all
that I can say to you further on the Matter, is
this, That seeing you are engaged, be sure ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to give over, or else <hi>let your Thrusts be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and your Blows keen; for Boxing and Caning
is <hi>Porters way of Fighting,</hi> and I would not have

                     <p>Thus have I sent Remarks upon <hi>Patricks</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Warrant, your Answer to it, and the
Letter you sent him whilst under Sail, I shall
next adde (for I now Answer two of your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
together) that I perceive by <hi>yours on the
Road,</hi> that you have left a <hi>Correspondent behind
you in</hi> Dublin to observe <hi>Patricks</hi> Motions; by
the Account you give me of his <hi>Printing, and
not Publishing his Advertisement,</hi> I perceive your
Letter from on Board, had some, though not all
the desir'd Effect upon him. His Printing after
you were gone, is a <hi>clear Proof of his Cowardice,</hi>
his uttering such manifest Untruths, is the like
of his Falshood, and his forbearing to Publish
them seems to argue his being <hi>Conscious of his
own Guilt.</hi> Whatever Proof it might be to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
his Beautiful Wife she had Married a Wit,</hi> it
could be none that she had Married either a Wife
or an Honest Man. As to your Remark on his
<hi>Education,</hi> that might have been spar'd, perhaps,
it was none of his Fault that it was not better,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59888:65"/>
and therefore he ought not to be upbraided
with it, except it proceeded from his own neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.
His <hi>Malice</hi> is indeed very remarkable, in
designing to Publish such a <hi>false Libel</hi> against
you, and particularly in reflecting upon those
you ordinarily Convers'd with, for it appears
plain enough by what I have heard from you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that you had the <hi>Honour to Converse with
those that were far above</hi> Patricks <hi>Merit, as being
some of the greatest Note in Church and State,</hi> but
any Excuse is better than none. I am glad how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
that your <hi>Scuffle</hi> with <hi>Patrick</hi> is ended at
last, both for your sake and my own, for to be
plain with you I have enough of it, and I am
sure, whether you think so or not, you have
too much. I am</p>

                     <p>I Told ye in my last from <hi>Chester,</hi> I had done
Scuffling with <hi>Patrick Campbel;</hi> but sure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
I am still fighting with Beasts at <hi>Ephesus:</hi>
For no sooner was my Scuffle with <hi>Patrick</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
over, but I was surrounded on every side.</p>
                     <p>First, <hi>F—(a meager sort of an Animal</hi>)
threatens a Token (<hi>in</hi> English <hi>a Warrant</hi>) to
fright me to a Compliance with unreasonable
Rates for Binding; but <hi>F</hi>—saw he was in
the <hi>Wrong-Box,</hi> and found it his Interest to be
Friends with me.</p>
                     <p>I was no sooner deliver'd from this Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
but <hi>a Young Stripling</hi> summons me before
the Lord <hi>Mayor</hi> of <hi>Dublin;</hi> he could not but think
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59888:66"/>
he was too rash, and therefore had no stomach
to argue before a Magistrate; So honest <hi>Servant</hi>
(a true Lover of Peace) gets us both to the <hi>Bull</hi>
in <hi>Nicholas-street,</hi> where the Lad saw his <hi>Error,</hi>
and we parted Friends; and I'le say that for
<hi>TOM</hi>—<q>That tho' he is <hi>a little hasty,</hi> yet he's
a very honest Fellow, was very faithful in the
Post I set him, and (<hi>writing an Extraordinary
hand</hi>) tis fit for a good place, which he can't
miss of in <hi>Dublin,</hi> for he might be trusted with
untold Gold.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I must leave <hi>Nelson</hi> to speak of the <hi>Brass</hi>
in <hi>Copper-Alley,</hi> who is another Beast I am yet
to fight with; This Fellow serves me with a
<hi>Token</hi> (I told ye the <hi>English</hi> of it before) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord <hi>Mayor</hi> I must go, I was more ready
to go then he was to have me, for there need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
nothing to plead for me, but the <hi>bare state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my Case;</hi> when his <hi>Lordship</hi> heard my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
he did me the Honour to say (Mr.
<hi>Wilde being then present</hi>) that I had made my
Adversary <hi>a very just Proposal—My Proposal
was,</hi> that one of his own Trade, and one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in the same Agreement, should end the
Controversie; so that all that <hi>Brass got by his
Token</hi> was to be hiss'd at by Honest Men, and
to be thought (if it could be) a little more
Impudent then heretofore; Sir, you'll find his
Picture in the following Letters; but more at
large (excepts he Repents) in my <hi>Summer-Ramble</hi>—</p>
                     <p>I next encountr'd a <hi>Female Devil</hi> (a Woman,
a thing in Petticoats) her Contrivance was to
C—d her. Husband; and to tempt me to this
Wickedness, she sends me a <hi>Billet Doux,</hi> (a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
of which you shall have hereafter) and calls
her self <hi>Dorinda,</hi> had her <hi>Billet</hi> taken Effect, her
<hi>Smiles</hi> had been more fatal than <hi>Patricks Frowns;
but God preserv'd me in this Temptation.</hi>

of it; and how have I found out <hi>a weak Brain,
a strong Temptation, or something or other</hi> to exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
the Offence. Yea, an intent of assaying
the World my self, hath disposed me to the pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
yea, almost to the Entertainment of his

that I have been well nigh blown up in

kept together. I therefore thought the <hi>best

Prospecetive</hi> to see the World in its genuine and

A Man must play the Cunning <hi>Astronomer,</hi>

<hi>Earthly things are a very Mist;</hi> before a Man comes
at it, he may see the Dimensions of a Fog, and
perhaps look over it, but when once invellopt
and clouded within it, his sight is limited to a
small extent. Gentlemen, such thoughts as
these made me retreat to that <hi>Countrey-like Seat</hi>
where (after <hi>Scuffling</hi> a while in <hi>Dublin</hi>) I'm
now going to live again; which being still and
private, and suited to a <hi>studious Life,</hi> is (next to
my <hi>Wife</hi>) the <hi>only thing</hi> on Earth I Love—</p>
                           <p>Gentlemen, having (largely) shewn you,
why I leave the <hi>Hurries of</hi> Dublin, and given my
Reasons for a <hi>Private Life</hi> when I return home;
having also told ye my Thoughts of <hi>Shop-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and of the several Copies I Printed, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
my Enemies will expect here (being faln
amongst Books) that I say something of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Spira,</hi> for though 'tis a Book quite forgot,
yet my Innocence is such (with respect to the
Printing of it) that I dare bring it again on the
Stage; and the rather still, as my <hi>Dublin Enemies</hi>
(and some in <hi>London</hi>) have snarl'd at it with so
much Fury.</p>
                           <p>As to this <hi>Second Spira,</hi> which my Enemies so
nibble at, perhaps the Publishing of <hi>that Relation</hi>
was one of the <hi>most Innocent Actions of my whole
Life;</hi> Gentlemen to prove this, I'll lead you <hi>step
by step</hi> into this Affair, so far as I was concern'd
in't—This Narrative was put into my hands
about <hi>Decem.</hi> 26. 1692. by the Methodizer of it,
who assured me, that he received the <hi>Memoirs</hi>
                              <pb n="122" facs="tcp:59888:75"/>
that composed it, from <hi>a Divine of the Church of</hi>
England, and as a Confirmation of this, he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
into my Hands <hi>a Letter and Preface,</hi> which
are Printed in the said Book (both which he said
was sent to him by the Divine that visited the
Sick Man) wherein the Divine says. <q>
                                 <hi>That ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
examined the Peice now 'tis perfected, with the
Original Notes and Papers which he drew himself, he
finds the Substance and Material Part very faithfully
done;</hi> he further adds, <hi>I dare affirm, that there's
nothing material left out, nor is there any Interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
which are not genuine</hi>—And in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the Methodizer, he begins thus, <hi>Sir, I
had yours with the Manuscript, and having compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it with the Memoires I took, I think you have
done me, and the Case of that miserable Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
a Rigid Iustice</hi>
                              </q>—My way being made
thus plain by these <hi>Attestations</hi> given me by a
Gentleman I had long known to be a Person of
Integrity, <hi>I</hi> procured Mr. <hi>Bohuns</hi> License to the
Book (which I have still by me.) After the Book
was Publish'd; several Clergy-men and others
inquiring of me the <hi>Truth of the Relation,</hi> I went
with them my self to the <hi>Methodizer</hi> of it (for
so he had order'd me to do, if any one enquir'd
about the Truth of it) who gave 'em al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> (<hi>as he owns
in his Preface to this Book</hi>) the very same account he
had given me, and they thereupon did me that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
as to <hi>acquit me of any unfair dealing in the Case,</hi>
and the same thing has been also done by the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodizer</hi>
himself in the <hi>Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth
Editions of this Book;</hi> so that I need add no more
on my own Account, for <hi>what can appear fairer?</hi>
But that no doubt may remain as to my Innocence
in this Matter, I further (and solemnly) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
in the Presence of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                              <hi>the searcher of all
Hearts</hi>) that I ne're thought of the <hi>Second Spira</hi> till
'twas brought to me, and that 'twas all (<hi>every
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59888:75"/>
Page, Line and Syllable of it</hi>) delivered to me as
a <hi>True Narrative.</hi> And 'tis worth Remark (as
it shews the <hi>Generosity of the</hi> London-<hi>Booksellers</hi>)
that but three of 'em quarrel'd with this Book, and
the first was that very Person who (as I can prove)
offer'd to be Partner in it; and that too, after his
going with me to the <hi>Methodizer,</hi> by which he
could know no more of <hi>Spira</hi> then I did, so that
'tis clear if I have Printed a <hi>False Spira</hi> (as I
hope not) that 'tis no more than an older Man
would have done, upon the same Informations
which I received.</p>
                           <p>But to do this Bookseller Justice, there were
several Divines (<hi>as well as he and I</hi>) that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
the Truth of the <hi>Second Spira</hi> (from the
Account the <hi>Methodizer</hi> gave of it) I could name
two that (<hi>from the Pulpit</hi>) advised their Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to read it—'Tis true, this Bookseller tells
you, he afterwards <hi>alter'd his mind</hi> (what the
<hi>Divines</hi> did, I can't say) but what of that? This
no ways affects me, for he would fain have been
concern'd at first (<hi>and to tempt me to it, promises
a Preface to recommend the Book</hi>) and <hi>I</hi> could see
no more into <hi>Futurity</hi> then he, and therefore <hi>I
fell a blushing,</hi> (for his sake, not for my own)
to hear him <hi>Rail</hi> at the Book—Gentlemen <hi>I</hi> real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thought it <hi>Second Spira</hi> had wanted a <hi>Champion,</hi>
this had been the very Man, he was so zealous for a
share in it; but <hi>I</hi> rejecting the offers he made, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of being the last [as <hi>I</hi> might expect] he
was the <hi>first Publick Enemy</hi> it met with.</p>
                           <p>And the next to him was a Man who leers
under his Hat, and may now <hi>see his Sin in his

was] <hi>I think it revenge enough to forgive him.</hi>

                           <p>A Third Slanderer of <hi>Second Spira</hi> [and is all
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59888:76"/>
I met with amongst Booksellers] was a <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Stationer,</hi>
who had no grudge against me
or the Book, yet had the Conscience to send it
to—to serve a Turn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I would explain my
self, (for here we are <hi>Bout-Ship,</hi> as we shall cry
by and by at Sea) but that, He's below himself,
that is not above an Injury, or at least the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
of a little Fellow. I am thus particular
in telling the Enemies to <hi>Second Spira,</hi> and in
Defending my Printing of it, that the World may
see what a <hi>vile thing</hi> Slandering is, (especially the
Private Slanderer.) <hi>The thing is True, but pray say
nothing you had it from me,</hi> is a Wound can never
be Cured,—<hi>'Tis Stabbing a Man behind,</hi>
and is the worst sort of Murther, as it leaves no
room for Defence.</p>
                           <p>And this has been my Fate, for <hi>I</hi> verily think,

to come;</hi> and this makes me yet think that the
<hi>Second Spira</hi> is a true Narrative: <hi>For <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>an't there
been as strange Concealments</hi> (Who'd have thought
that <hi>Overbury's Murder</hi> would have come to light
5 <hi>years</hi> after 'twas done) and <hi>I believe the Methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer,</hi>
a Man of that <hi>Honour &amp; Vertue,</hi> that had he the
least suspition, that <hi>I S, (the Divine which he says
gave him the Notes</hi>) had impos'd upon him, he'd
soon Publish the same to the World, and as a
Christian ought, own his Error in being imposed
upon.—This is what <hi>I</hi> believe of the <hi>Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizer;</hi>
and as for my own share, <hi>my Innocence is
such</hi> (as <hi>I</hi> have here shewn by running through
<hi>all the steps of the Publication</hi>) that if <hi>I</hi> find <hi>Second
Spira</hi> a Lye (tho' 'twere Ten Year hence) I'd be the
first should tell it; and be as zealous for Printing
the <hi>Methodizers Recantation.</hi> But till such Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is made, I shall still believe it as much the true
<hi>Spira,</hi> as his in <hi>Newgate-Street,</hi> who to shew the
honesty of his <hi>little Soul,</hi> calls his Book the <hi>True
Spira,</hi> that mine might be thought <hi>a False One,</hi> or as
is the Relation of <hi>Francis Spira,</hi> whence this <hi>Second
Spira</hi> has its name.—Now <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> what <hi>I</hi>
have here said of the <hi>Second Spira,</hi> being what <hi>I</hi>
am able to swear to, upon all <hi>the Bibles</hi> in the
Kings Dominions, and if my Credit appears hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
Unspotted and Free, and not stain'd with
Base Little and Dishonourable Actions, <hi>I</hi> hope
(to use the words of the Methodizer) <hi>I shall have
that common Charity in this Affair, which every one
would be unwilling to be deny'd, were he in my cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances;</hi>
and you can't go to a <hi>Binder, Printer,
or Stationer,</hi> in <hi>Dublin,</hi> or <hi>London</hi> either, (for <hi>I</hi>
owe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59888:77"/>
may have full satisfaction upon this last head.
But if after all <hi>I</hi> have here said, there is any one
yet so base, as to reflect upon the <hi>Methodizer of
the Second Spira,</hi> or upon my self, for Printing
that Dismal Narrative, <hi>I</hi> have only to tell 'em,
That <hi>I as little matter, as I deserve, their unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Censures.</hi>—<hi>Gentlemen, I</hi> shall only add,
(as to <hi>Second Spira</hi>) that the <hi>Methodizer</hi> never saw
this Apology for Printing of it; for <hi>Truth is ever
the same:</hi> And having said nothing but what <hi>I</hi>
can prove at large, <hi>I</hi> thought it a greater
proof of my Innocence, to <hi>Publish it without his
knowledge:</hi> Neither could <hi>I</hi> have consulted him, if
I would, for he lives 300 Miles from <hi>Dublin;</hi> and
I do declare, in the <hi>Presence of God, Angels and Men,</hi>
that I writ this <hi>Defence of Spira and Farewel Letter,</hi>
with my own hand, whilst <hi>I</hi> liv'd with Mr. <hi>Caw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>
in that City, and that in the presence of Mr.
<hi>Larkin,</hi> who is now going for <hi>England</hi> with me,
and I hope you'll wish us a <hi>Boon Voyage.</hi>—And
I think <hi>Gentlemen, my not consulting with the
Methodizer</hi> in this matter, is enough of it self,
(had I omitted all that I said before) to shew my
Innocence as to <hi>Second Spira,</hi> concerning which,
I have said nothing but what I would say, were I
now taking my last leave of the World, and the
<hi>Irish Voyage,</hi> on which I am just entring, is near
a kin to that <hi>long and awful Iourney.</hi>—But
so much for the <hi>Second Spira,</hi> of which I Sold
about 20000, and when the <hi>Gentleman is known,</hi> I
believe I shall treble the Number.</p>
                           <p>Thus Gentlemen, having in this <hi>Farewel</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

this Learned Prelate, was a Generous Encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of my Undertaking; He is a Person of Great

his own Extraordinary Parts, that soon
after the Thirtieth Year of his Age (which is
the year of Quallification for that Office) he was
made <hi>Provost</hi> of <hi>Trinity College</hi> in <hi>Dublin,</hi> a place
of great Honour and Trust; where he so well
acquitted himself, that in a little time he was
Constituted <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Clogher,</hi> and soon after
that, for his great Accomplishments, was made
One of His Majesties <hi>Privy Councellors</hi> for the
Kingdom of <hi>Ireland.</hi> I might mention his great
knowlege of the <hi>Tongues</hi> and most <hi>Sciences,</hi> but the
bare relating the <hi>Publick Stations</hi> he is in, are
sufficient demonstrations of the Reasons of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
Promotions, and of the great Honour he
did me by <hi>personally</hi> encouraging my undertaking,
and therefore I hope his Lordship will pardon
me for presuming to mention him in this <hi>Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well;</hi>
for I shou'd think my self very ungrateful,
should I leave <hi>Ireland</hi> without making this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
acknowledgement of the Favours I receiv'd
from him. His Lordships Name is <hi>St. George
Ashe.</hi>

                              <p>I should likewise in this <hi>Farewel,</hi> take my leave
of the Reverend Mr. <hi>Iohn Iones,</hi> the most Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
School-master in all <hi>Ireland;</hi> he hath sent
many Scholars to the University of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and
I don't wonder he's so Accomplish'd; for he's
a man of so great a <hi>Soul,</hi> that I found he was
seldom out-bid in my <hi>Auction</hi> for any Book he
had a mind to. He's a very <hi>Studious Person,</hi>
and does not (like some Authors) lose his time
by being busie about nothing; nor make so poor
a use of the World, as to <hi>Hug</hi> and <hi>Embrace</hi> it: I
shall ever acknowledge the <hi>Generous Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
he gave my <hi>Auctions.</hi> In the short <hi>Conferen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of great Piety, and of a most sweet Disposition;
He is free from Vice, if ever any Man was,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59888:80"/>
because he hath no occasion to use it, and is
<hi>above those Ends that make men wicked.</hi> In a
word, Mr. <hi>Iones</hi> is a Person of great <hi>Worth,
Learning,</hi> and <hi>Humility;</hi> Lives Universally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd,
and: his Conversation is coveted by all
that have the happiness to know him.</p>
                              <p>But I take leave of the Reverend Mr. <hi>Iones,</hi>
that I may next shed a few <hi>Tears</hi> on the <hi>Grave</hi>
of the most ingenious Mr. <hi>Davis;</hi> for tho' he
is dead and gone, the service he did my <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
shall live as long as I can <hi>Write</hi> or <hi>Read,</hi>
he was Famous for a School-master, and so E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
for <hi>Preaching,</hi> that his death was lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by all that knew him; and I may truly
say of him, <hi>Vixit post Funera Virtus</hi>—I had
not the happiness of <hi>once hearing</hi> this Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Preacher, and <hi>I</hi> can't say <hi>I</hi> ever saw him;
but <hi>I</hi> am told (by one that knew him well) that
if <hi>I</hi> have err'd in his Character, <hi>'tis that I have
said too little</hi>—But tho' I can't do justice
to his Personal <hi>Merits</hi> (being wholly a stranger
to him) yet Mr. <hi>Wild</hi> tells me, he was a true
Friend to my Undertaking, and therefore at
leaving <hi>Dublin,</hi> I ought to strew some <hi>Flowers</hi>
on his <hi>Herse,</hi> and thank his very <hi>Ashes</hi> for the
kindness he did his <hi>unknown Admirer.</hi>

                              <p>Leaving this Good Man asleep in his <hi>Grave,

Pious Dr. <hi>Iohn Stearn,</hi> Minister of St. <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi>-Church;
He is a most Excellent Preacher,
and as good a Liver; This worthy Divine was
my Friend, not only in buying diverse Books
for his own use, but also in buying for others,
and so far was he from that ungenerous Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
(not to call it worse) of depriving me
of Reasonable Rates, that he would assure the
Bidders <hi>such and such Books were good, and a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyworth</hi>
at such and such Rates, as he inform'd

them of; neither was his <hi>Generous-Bidding for

in a Pulpit. And those that go to this Church

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59888:81"/>
by my Learned Friend the Reverend Mr.
<hi>Searl,</hi> the present Lecturer. But to proceed
to the Character of Dean <hi>Francis:</hi> His <hi>Piety</hi> is
as Remarkable as his <hi>Preaching,</hi> and his <hi>Charity</hi>
as remarkable as either. Mr. <hi>Feltham</hi> says, <hi>A
good Tongue never wanted Ears to hear it;</hi> for my
own share, I must say, that morning Mr. <hi>Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin</hi>
and I heard the Dean, he preach'd in so
<hi>refin'd a manner,</hi> that I could ha' heard him
with pleasure till night, and my Friend (as I
found by the Remarks he made on the Sermon)
could gladly have heard him as long as I. I
wou'd enlarge in the Dean's <hi>Character,</hi> but that
he was a Generous Buyer, and (as the case
stands) I think it proper to say little of the
great Benefactors; so I shall leave the Dean (with
humble thanks for the Favours he did me) to
pay a Visit and <hi>Farewel</hi> to my true Friend, and
great Benefactor, the Reverend Mr. <hi>Searl;</hi> he
was a frequent Buyer at my <hi>Auction,</hi> which I
did not forget to acknowledge both at my <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
and afterwards at the <hi>Curragh,</hi> where (in
my Ramble to <hi>Kilkenney</hi>) I had the good Luck
to meet him, I had now and then the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of spending a few agreeable minutes in
this Gentlemans Company, which <hi>I</hi> thought no
ordinary Blessing, as he was a Person of a tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Humble and Affable carriage—As to his
Preaching, 'tis <hi>Plain, Pure,</hi> and <hi>Edifying,</hi> and
generally without-book: The last Sermon <hi>I</hi>
heard in <hi>Ireland,</hi> was Preach'd by the Reverend
Mr. <hi>Searle,</hi> upon these Words,<note n="a" place="margin">Luke 2.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                                 <hi>For unto you is

<hi>I</hi> thought it the most <hi>Practical and awakening

my leave with this short acknowledgment—</p>
                              <p>And my next <hi>Farewel</hi> shall be to the Reverend
Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> (Chaplain to the Right Honourable
the Earl of <hi>Meath</hi>) this Gentleman was a great
Encourager of my <hi>Auction,</hi> by which means <hi>I</hi>
had the happiness of enjoying his Company of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;
we were together that very time when <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick
Campbel</hi> refus'd to meet me at the <hi>Keys</hi> in
<hi>High street.</hi> The Satisfaction <hi>I</hi> receiv'd in Mr.
<hi>Fishers</hi> company, obliges me to attempt his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.
<hi>He is all that's delightful in Conversation,</hi>
so easy company, and so far from all constraint,
that 'tis a real pleasure to talk with him; he's
a Person of a sweet natural Temper, one that's
<hi>never out of Humour,</hi> and <hi>I</hi> must say, <hi>I</hi> found
his Friendship to be ever <hi>equal</hi> and the <hi>same</hi>—In
a word, 'tis a Vertue to know him, and <hi>a
glimpse of Heaven to hear him Preach:</hi> But dear
Sir Adieu, for the wind is Fair, and <hi>I</hi> must be
gone; but <hi>I</hi> leave your Company with as much
regret as ever <hi>I</hi> did any <hi>Earthly Blessing.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Having taken my leave of the Clergy, my
<hi>next Visits must be to the Layety;</hi> and these must
be very short, <hi>for fear the Ship should Sail</hi> before <hi>I</hi>
finish my Letter.</p>
                              <p>And here <hi>I</hi> shall first take my leave of the
Honourable <hi>Colonel Butler,</hi> a Member of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59888:82"/>
He is a great Lover of Books, and was
a constant and generous Encourager of all my
<hi>Auctions.</hi> His <hi>Affability, Candour,</hi> and <hi>extraordinary
Sense;</hi> but more especially his ingenuity in <hi>Painting
to the Life,</hi> is beyond what <hi>I</hi> ever saw (<hi>in my whole
Life</hi>) but at his House, and in his Person. 'Tis
to this <hi>Honourable Gentleman I</hi> Dedicate my
<hi>Dublin Scuffle,</hi> where (and in my Visit to him)
you have his Character more at large, so with
a <hi>short Farewel</hi> to the Noble Colonel,</p>
                              <p>I shall next pass on to own my great Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
to Mr. <hi>Lum</hi>—<hi>Gradon</hi>

                              <p>Neither can <hi>I</hi> in <hi>this place</hi> forget the many
Favours <hi>I</hi> received from that Worthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<hi>Christopher Vsher</hi> Esq. (a Relation of
that Famous Prelate <hi>Arch Bishop Vsher</hi>) He's a
Person of True Piety, solid Judgment, and
Great Estate, and God has given him a Heart
to do good with it in his Life Time, for he
is very Eminent for his Great Charity, and a
Vast Encourager of Learning; he laid out
several Pounds at my Auction, and almost
daily honoured me with his Presence at my
Sale. <hi>I</hi> could write a <hi>Folio in this Gentlemans
Praise,</hi> but he's as Humble as he's Rich;
so <hi>I</hi> sha'nt inlarge, lest <hi>I</hi> offend his Modesty:
But this hint is enough to shew how wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
he is of that Great Name he bears; and
therefore however he may resent this <hi>Publick
Farewel</hi> (considering his Great Humility) yet <hi>I</hi>
could not think of leaving <hi>Ireland</hi> without pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my thanks to him, not only as he was my
Friend, but one of my <hi>Chief Benefactors.</hi>

Lives universally Belov'd, and justly merits
the Honour he enjoys: He was pleased to cause
several Books to be bought for him at my Sale.
And here <hi>I</hi> cannot omit to add to the rest of my
Benefactors (<hi>in this Farewel</hi>) Mr. <hi>Baron Ecling,</hi>
a Person of Great Honour, and of a <hi>Greatness of
Soul</hi> beyond most that <hi>I</hi> ever heard of: He is such
an <hi>Vniversal Lover of Books,</hi> that very few, if
any, shall escape him, whatever they cost: He
has a <hi>very Large and Curious Library,</hi> yet as
inquisitive still after Rarities, as if he had none:
He is a most Noble Encourager of the <hi>Book-selling-Trade,</hi>
and whenever he dyes, the <hi>Stationers of

what the Publick will sustain thereby.</p>

                                 <hi>I</hi> have also many Thanks to return to Captain

who were great Encouragers of my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.</p>
                              <p>Neither can <hi>I</hi> think of leaving <hi>Dublin,</hi> before <hi>I</hi>
have taken my leave of my Three Printers, <hi>Mr.
Brent, Mr. Powel, and Mr. Brocas,</hi> for they
come into the number of my <hi>Benefactors;</hi> and
I'm told, bought several Books in my Auction;
besides to forget these, would be a little unkind,
not only as they served me (once) at a <hi>Pinch,</hi>
but as they Printed my daily Catalogues: and
'twas only by their Presses, that <hi>I</hi> could now and
then Thunder at <hi>Patrick Campbel,</hi> and defy all my

obliges me to give each of these Printers a
particular Character.</p>
                              <p>And <hi>I</hi> shall first begin with Mr. <hi>Brent,</hi> who,

Honest, Conscientious Man,</hi> and I do think, a
<hi>True Nathaniel,</hi> he's perfect Innocence, yet a Man
of <hi>Letters;</hi> he knows no harm, and therefore
contrives none: And by his frequent attempts
to make <hi>Campbel</hi> and <hi>I</hi> Friends, 'tis clear, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
promoted the <hi>Dublin-Scuffle,</hi> tho the Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it would have furnish'd him with <hi>daily work;</hi>
so that he's what we may truly call a <hi>Religious
Printer,</hi> (and I was going to say) he hates Vice,
almost as-much by <hi>Nature as Grace;</hi> and this I
think is his True Character.</p>
                              <p>

Person is Handsom (<hi>I don't know whether he knows
it or no) and his mind has as many Charms:</hi> He's
the very Life and Spirit of the Company where

upon it: He's a Man of a great deal of <hi>Wit and
Sense</hi> (and I hope of as much Hone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

'tis a pleasure to observe how <hi>handsomly be acquits
himself;</hi> in the mean time, he's neither Scurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous

Printer, as well as a good Companion.</hi>

                              <p>I come next to <hi>Honest Brocas,</hi> the third Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,

                              <p>Mr. <hi>Brocas</hi> is much of a Gentleman, he gave
me a Noble Welcome to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and never grew
less Obliging: He's one that loves his Friend
as his Life (nay, he values Mr. <hi>Wild</hi> beyond it)
and I may say, without offence to the <hi>Printers of
Dublin,</hi> that no Man in the Universe, better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands
the <hi>Noble Art and Mystery of Printing,</hi>
than <hi>Iohn Brocas</hi> in <hi>Skinner Row;</hi> and as a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold

                              <p>And Gentlemen, as your House is Airy, Great
and Noble (and the <hi>Top Printing-House</hi> in all
<hi>Dublin</hi>) so if you keep together, Copies so Croud
in (<hi>from Patrick Campbel, &amp;c.</hi>) you'll soon be
<hi>Aldermen of Dublin,</hi> and in time arrive to the
Honour of <hi>Lord Mayor;</hi> and what a charming

Figure will the <hi>Beautiful Powel</hi> make, when at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

but when <hi>I</hi> come to <hi>Dublin</hi> with another <hi>Cargo of

                              <p>And this (tho' he's going with me) brings me
in the <hi>last place,</hi> to own my Great Obligations
to my Most Ingenious Friend, Mr. <hi>George Larkin,</hi>
whose <hi>Noble Treatment</hi> at his own house, and
Great Readiness to Serve me at all hours, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all occasions, <hi>from the first minute I saw</hi> Dublin,
<hi>to the last hour I staid in it,</hi> shall be kindly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to my dying day.—But I can't in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large,
for Mr. <hi>Larkin</hi> is come to tell me, the
Ship is going to Sail, which makes me Tremble,
for tho' I've crost the Ocean often, yet I still
dread the <hi>Irish Sea;</hi> but my comfort is, Mr.
<hi>Larkin</hi> (like a true Friend) still ventures his
Life with me, and <hi>I can never dye in better Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</hi>

                              <p>Thus have I paid my thanks where I think it due,
and given a <hi>Farewel to all my Friends,</hi> and as I took
my <hi>Leave,</hi> have Characterized my Benefactors,
concerning whom, I have said nothing but the
real Truth; and Gentlemen, I have often wisht,
there were no such thing as a <hi>Complement in the
World,</hi> and therefore I flatter no Man <hi>in these
Characters;</hi> I have no occasion to do it (for my
Auction's ended, and I'm leaving <hi>Ireland</hi>) besides
<hi>I was not born to creep,</hi> neither is it agreeable to
my Temper of mind; but a Man may be grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
sure, without being of a <hi>mean Spirit.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>

But perhaps my <hi>Enemies</hi> will say, I'm thus
large in Praising my Friends, that my <hi>Scuffle</hi>
may Sell the better. I do declare, this is all as false,
as what they said about <hi>Second Spira,</hi> &amp;c. for I
don't write this <hi>Farewel,</hi> or the <hi>Dublin-Scuffle,</hi>
to get a Penny, my Circumstances set me above
it (the <hi>Athenians long since told you, my Raven was
gon to Roost</hi>) neither do I publish it out of Vain
Glory, to be talked of when I'm gone; for as
<hi>Cowley</hi> says, <hi>I'd Live unthought of, and unheard
of Dye:</hi> and my aversion to Shops (and <hi>Private
Dwelling in Iewin-street</hi>) proves I'm of this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour;
but I Publish it purely to do justice to my
self (in the first place) and then to my <hi>Dublin
Enemies;</hi> and (lastly) that the World may see
<hi>How Generous my Friends were;</hi> and who knows,
but my Enemies, by seeing other Mens Vertue,
(<hi>and how charming it makes 'em look</hi>) may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to practice it; but whether they do or
no, I must declare the <hi>Honest Dealings</hi> I had from
'em, is that alone which has put me i'th' head of
a <hi>Second Auction,</hi> so that as soon as <hi>I</hi> get to
<hi>London, I</hi> shall fall to Printing <hi>several Copies</hi> in
order to Furnish out a <hi>New Venture,</hi> with which
<hi>I</hi> shall march directly for <hi>Scotland,</hi> and when

                              <p>Gentlemen, This Rambling Project owes its
Rise to something I found in the <hi>Athenian Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
which being an <hi>Invention of my own</hi> that
has pleased the Age (for 'twas continued
to <hi>Twenty Volumns</hi>) I hope the same by this, for
'twill be as <hi>Pleasant a Maggot,</hi> and I'll endeavour
to make it as Useful.—</p>
                              <p>Gentlemen, If you ask me, How I can think of
<hi>Rambling</hi> thus, having lately Marryed a <hi>Second
Wife?</hi> To this I answer, I am Marryed indeed,—but
'tis to One (to use the words of my first Wife)
<hi>Who knows it her Prudence and Duty, to study my
humour, in every thing</hi> (I mean every thing that
en't sinful) and finding I am for Travelling (<hi>to
shew the height of her Love</hi>) is as willing I should
see <hi>Europe,</hi> as <hi>Eliza</hi> was I should see <hi>America;</hi>
so that, you see Gentlemen, neither my First,
nor my Second Wife, have been
<hi>She-Clogs,</hi>

call'd his Spouse; they were both
pleased as it pleases me, with my <hi>Rambling Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,</hi>
then to be sure (this Temper is so Obliging)
as soon as my <hi>Eye is satisfyed with seeing,</hi> I'll hasten
home to the Dear <hi>Valeria,</hi> Run to meet her with
Devouring Arms; and then Live, and (if possible)
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59888:86"/>
dye together—'Tis true, the Man in
the Gospel <hi>had married a Wife, and he cou'd not
leave her,</hi> but he was not born to Ramble, or he
must have pursu'd his Destiny: Sure <hi>I</hi> am, if
any thing cou'd keep me at home, 'tis a Tender
Wife, such a one as <hi>I</hi> NOW enjoy; for there is
such an Union between us, that we seem but as
<hi>Two Souls Transform'd into One;</hi> and <hi>I</hi> must say,
Were her mighty Tenderness known to the
World, it wou'd once more bring into Fashion
Women's Loving and Trusting their Husbands.
But tho' <hi>Love is strong as Death,</hi> and ev'ry good
Man loves his Wife as himself, yet I cann't think
of being confin'd in a <hi>Narrower Study</hi> than the
whole World. He is Truly a Scholar who is
vers'd in the Volume of the Universe, who doth
not so much Read of Nature, as Study Nature
her Self. Who'd ha' thought I cou'd ever have
left <hi>Eliza?</hi> For there was an <hi>even Thread of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearment
run through all we Said or Did:</hi> I may tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
say, For the Fifteen years we lived together,
there never passed an Angry Look: But (as Kind
as she was) <hi>I</hi> cou'd not think of growing Old in
the Consines of one City, and therefore in <hi>Eighty
Six</hi> I Embark'd for <hi>America, Holland,</hi> and other
Parts: But tho' we parted a while, 'twas by Free
Consent of <hi>FATHER</hi> and <hi>WIFE,</hi> as my Coming
now to <hi>Ireland,</hi> was by Consent of <hi>Mother</hi> and
<hi>Daughter: I</hi> found then that the Arms of Love
were long enough to reach from <hi>London to the
West-Indies;</hi> and to encourage me to Ramble
now, they are as long as ever: What tho <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
France and Italy,</hi> &amp;c. part our Bodies, yet
we have Souls to be sure, and whilst they can
meet and caress, we may enjoy each other, <hi>were
we the length of the Map a sunder:</hi> So, that you
see, Gentlemen, tho' I have Marryed a Second
Wife, yet that I Love her never the less for
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59888:86"/>
Rambling, but (were't possible) a great deal
more, for <hi>Distance endears Love, and Absence
makes it thrive.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>If a Wife don't give me some proof of her
Love (for Fine Words are but <hi>painted Babies</hi> to
play with) how shall I know she loves me at all?
And can she give me a greater Test, then by tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of me, in a Thousand Endearing Letters,
<hi>That to be out of her sight, is to be still the more in
her mind?</hi> When I was in <hi>New-England,</hi> I sent
<hi>Eliza, Sixty Letters</hi> by one Ship, as you'll find in
my Ramble thither.</p>
                              <p>Were <hi>Valeria</hi> and I always together, these
(sort of) Endearments were wholly lost, and
we to seek (for want of a Touch-stone) <hi>whether
we Lov'd in earnest.</hi> So that I think to Ramble,
is the best way to endear a Wife, and to try her
Love, if she has any, which is so rare a thing
(since Women have marry'd for Money) that
for my own share, I'd Ramble as far as <hi>Chin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                       <desc>•</desc>
                                    </gap>,</hi> to
be convinc'd of the <hi>least Scruple.</hi> 'Tis true, for a
Wife to say, as <hi>Eliza</hi> did, <hi>My Dear, I Rejoyce
I am able to serve thee, and as long as I have it, 'tis
all thine</hi> (and we had been still happy, had we
lost all, but one another) this indeed is very
Obliging, and shews she loves me in earnest; but
still there is <hi>something in Rambling beyond this;</hi> for
this is no more (if her Husband he Sober) then
<hi>Richer for Poorer,</hi> obliges her to; but for a Spouse
to cry, <hi>Travel as far as you please, and stay as long
as you will, for Absence shall ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

flight abundantly, as it shews she can part with
her <hi>very Husband</hi> (Ten times Dearer to a Good
Wife than her Money) when it tends to his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.—Since
to Ramble then from my
<hi>Second Wife,</hi> is the best way to express my Love,
and Endears like any thing; I say, considering
this, I'll soon be on my <hi>Scotch Ramble;</hi> and if I

Return Rich in <hi>Valeria</hi>'s opinion, tho St. <hi>Andrew</hi>
Frown as much as St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> I shall think I make

                              <p>Thus Gentlemen, have I fairly prov'd, <hi>That Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
Endears a Wife,</hi> if she's good for any thing, and
that <hi>Rambling</hi> becomes a Duty to him that's well
Marryed: A <hi>Duty?</hi> Ay! Sure enough! For <hi>Valeria</hi>
and I improve our <hi>Separation</hi> to better use than if
we had been together; for by <hi>Absence,</hi> we better fill,
and farther extend the possession of our Lives, in
being parted; <hi>She Lives, Rejoyces and Sees for me,</hi> and
<hi>I</hi> for her, as plainly (for we are still but two Souls
in the same Body) as if I had my self been there—And
<hi>I must say that of</hi> Eliza <hi>too,</hi> We did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
Affection, and carry on two Interests; Her
sympathy with me in all the Distresses of my Life
(both at Sea and Land) make her Vertues shine
with the greater Lustre, <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not my Fortunes; like the Glow-worm (<hi>that
Emblem of True Friendship</hi>) She shin'd to me, even
in the Dark: She has been almost ready to wish
us Unfortunate, that she might give me the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Test of her Love. <hi>My Head, no sooner ak'd, but her
Heart felt it; and had I faln Sick (in her Dying

                                    </gap>en me;</hi> and to requite her Love (for a kind
Wife makes a kind Husband) I'd have parted
with Garment after Garment; stript my self to
my very Skin; yea, <hi>Mortgaged my very Flesh,</hi> to
have served her.—And indeed all our Distresses
of Body and Mind, were so equally divided, that
all hers were mine, and all mine were hers; we
remembred we were <hi>One Flesh,</hi> and therefore
were no more offended with the Words, Failings
or Wants, of each other, than we would have
been, had they been our own; had we Lov'd
at a less Rate, our Pretences to Love had been

meer Banter: <hi>True Conjugal Love, is a step above
House or Land!</hi> Neither durst I ha' marry'd, had
I lov'd <hi>Eliza</hi> less than my Self. But as True and
Great as our Endearments were, I found I cou'd
love as well <hi>Absent</hi> as <hi>Present;</hi> and therefore I as
little scrupl'd the Leaving <hi>Eliza,</hi> as I now do the
<hi>Kind Valeria.</hi>—</p>
                              <p>Gentlemen, I had not troubled you with such
<hi>soft Tender Things,</hi> but to let you see my <hi>Rambling
Now,</hi> (as well as Formerly) is the Effect of <hi>Choice</hi>
and not <hi>Disgust.</hi> If you doubt this,
Read the Character<note n="a" place="margin">Printed for <hi>J. Harris</hi> at the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Britain</hi>
                                 </note> of my First
Wife, and you'll find it confirm'd
with her last Breath.</p>
                              <p>Then, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> cease wondering
that I can Talk of Rambling so soon
after Marrying a <hi>Second Wife.</hi> For
you see (by the Happiness I enjoy in her) that he
that is born under a Rambling Planet, all that
he does to Fix him at Home, does but Hasten his
Travels Abroad.—<hi>I</hi> found it thus when <hi>Eliza,</hi>
liv'd, and the case is the same now: For tho <hi>I</hi> am
married again, and that to a Wife of whom <hi>I</hi> may
say, <q>
                                    <hi>That She fully Vnderstands and Practices all
the Duties of a Tender Wife; so that she seems to
be</hi> Eliza still in a New Edition, more Correct and
Enlarged; or rather my First Wife in a New
Frame: For I have only chang'd the Person, but
not the Vertues.—</q>But for all this present
Happiness, being born to Travel, <hi>I</hi> am e'er
and anon Talking of <hi>Ships, The Marriner's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass,
and Going to Sea,</hi> and cann't be easie an hour
together, without thinking of some <hi>far Countrey.</hi>
If 'twere not thus, <hi>I</hi> had never left Mother,
Daughter, House and Home, to Ramble I knew
not whither, and to see I know not what. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the <hi>Winding Chambers of Nature,</hi> I even then
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59888:88"/>
lay Forming Ideas of <hi>Long' Voyages and New
Worlds:</hi> For ever since I came into Being, to
<hi>Ramble</hi> has been as Natural to me as Eating.—</p>
                              <p>Thus (at parting) have I <hi>Set my Self in a True
Light;</hi> have Thank'd my Friends for their many
Favours, and am pretty even with all my Enemies;
but more especially with <hi>P. Campbel, T. F. and
the Foes to the Second Spira,</hi> &amp;c. And now if <hi>T. F.</hi>
or any one else thinks himself injur'd in <hi>This Scuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle,</hi>
I must tell him, as I did <hi>Patrick, That the
Press is Open. Gentlemen,</hi> If you'd know who I
mean by this <hi>T. F.</hi> I shall answer this, by asking,
Who do you mean by <hi>I N. take thee M.</hi> in the
<hi>Form of Matrimony?</hi> I mean no body but he that
shews his Guilt by Wincing; and whoever that
Person be, I'll Reply to him (as I told <hi>Campbel)
de die in diem,</hi> till I wear my Pen to the Stumps,
'Tis true, <hi>Patrick Refus'd to Answer my Broad
Side, (I</hi> mean my Second Letter in the <hi>Dublin-Scuffle</hi>)
as knowing his own Guilt: And I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<hi>BRASS</hi> will have <hi>more Wit</hi> than to have his
Life Expos'd: But if he has more Courage than
<hi>Patrick</hi> had, and will Answer this with his Name
to it, I shall Treat him as a Generous Enemy.
But if <hi>Brass</hi> (or any one else) offers to murder
my Reputation in a private manner, I shall smell
(as I did before) whence the Malice springs, and
will do my self Justice on <hi>Patrick Campbel,</hi> and
the <hi>Wanton Fop</hi> of <hi>Copper-Alley,</hi> and on a certain
Person who boasts (for 'tis only such are my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies)
he has lain with several Leud Women:
Gentlemen, The Hints I have by me on <hi>These
Heads,</hi> are large enough for <hi>a Second Part of the
Dublin-Scuffle;</hi> which I resolve to Publish, if they
slander me when I am gone, or offer to cleanse
their hands by laying their vile <hi>Practices</hi> at my
Door, which I am clear of, so much <hi>as in thought;</hi>
                                 <pb n="149" facs="tcp:59888:88"/>
Neither cou'd they brand me with an ill thing, <hi>for
the 9 Months I liv'd in</hi> Dublin; for I dar'd 'em

<hi>Black was my Eye:</hi> but when I am shipt off,
and gone too far to disprove their Lies, then to
invalidate my Charge against 'em, they'l per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
call me <hi>Drunkard, Swearer, Sheep-stealer,
Whore-master, Murderer,</hi> and what not? For
<hi>how far will Revenge carry men?</hi> But my comfort

of the foresaid <hi>Monsters;</hi> for they can no more
prove me one than t'other: And therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Lyes they spread, or <hi>Leud Wretches</hi> may be
tempted to swear; and some Evidence (<hi>especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Irish</hi>) will swear through an Inch board;
as was seen in the Case of the Earl of <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
and at other Tryals, yet I defy the worst
their Revenge can utter, <hi>provided I have a fair
hearing;</hi> but that I shall never have, for they
durst not (but in private) slander me whilst I
staid, and when, Gentlemen, I'm gone, rather
than want something to charge me with,
they'l make that exact Justice I did ye all, pass
for a piece of Hypocrisie. But if that be White
and Innocent too, then will they go near to
indict my very <hi>Care and my Caution,</hi> and make
my very <hi>flying Temptations</hi> to be (tho but su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficially)
Criminal. But if my <hi>Conversation</hi>
be Fair and Honest, (the Account of which

not fail to produce as Evidence against me—</p>
                              <p>Gentlemen, of this Temper I found my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
in the <hi>Dublin-Scuffle,</hi> and this is the Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                              <p>Thus (Gentlemen) you see I am prepar'd, for
the worst that <hi>Patrick</hi> (and all his Scoundrels) can

must expect as <hi>abusive Dirt as their foul hands are

they can say or invent, won't at all surprize me;

                        <salute>SIR;</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>I Have received so many of <hi>Your Letters</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
your <hi>Irish Adventures,</hi> that one more
will make them up a <hi>Baker's Dozen:</hi> By your last,
I perceive you are like a True <hi>Game Cock,</hi> being
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59888:90"/>
once Engag'd, there's no <hi>Dis-engaging you</hi> again.
You are so much flush'd with your <hi>Victories</hi> in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> that I perceive you breathe nothing but
Dreadful Threats against your Enemies in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
enough to make them either run away, or
meet you on the Road with <hi>Terms of Submission;</hi>
which (you look so big) I am afraid must be no
less, than to submit to the Will of the Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
and Surrender on Discretion: And to be
free with you, I think 'twill be their <hi>Best Way;</hi>
and if I knew them, would send them <hi>Penny-Post
Letters</hi> a piece to perswade them to it. You need
not make any Apology for not <hi>fig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ting your Way
in Tropes and Figures,</hi> for your Flights are so Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
that I do believe they can be reduc'd
under any of the Rules of our <hi>Common Rhetorick.</hi>
To make a handsome Retreat, is one of the best
Accomplishments in a <hi>Good Captain;</hi> but I don't
perceive yours to be any thing of that nature:
To me, it looks more like the <hi>Sounding of a New
Charge;</hi> and by your Way of <hi>Marching to the
Field, I</hi> can almost Assure you of the <hi>Victory,</hi>
without giving my self the Trouble of Consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Entrails of Birds or Beasts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now to your <hi>Last Farwel</hi> to your Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
in <hi>Dublin,</hi> whether <hi>Friends</hi> or <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Your very first Line is a <hi>Cordial</hi> to the former,
and a <hi>Corrosive</hi> to the latter. <hi>You have Sold
your Venture of Books;</hi> then <hi>Patrick,</hi> I perceive,
has Scuffled with you to little Purpose. If this
be the first Note of your <hi>Retreat,</hi> I can scarcely
imagine what other you can make use of for a
<hi>Triumph;</hi> but this I impute to your Modesty.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Catalogue</hi> of <hi>Your Books,</hi> which you
think fit to exhibit, to shew the World they
were not <hi>Trash,</hi> as your Enemies maliciously al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59888:90"/>
them to be, I am of Opinion you might
have sav'd your self the Labour. Those that
Bought them did not Think them so; Else they
<hi>Reflected upon Themselves, more than your Enemies
did upon You:</hi> And as for <hi>Booksellers</hi> who call'd
them by that Name, it would have passd well
enough under the Notion of the no less True,
than Common Saying, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Two of a Trade
can never Agre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>:</hi>—And as to Others, your
Catalogue is no Vindication: For there are Men
in the World who will 'call the <hi>first and best Book
in your Catalogue, Trash;</hi> I mean the Bible: And
therefore well may others be so call'd: Nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is there any thing more usual amongst de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved
Men, than so undervalue what does not
agree with their own <hi>private Sentiments,</hi> or what
they have not an Interest in themselves.</p>
                     <p>But admitting, that in your <hi>Venture,</hi> there
might be <hi>some Trash;</hi> I would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the World must endure the Pennance to have it
in their Houses and Hands, so that the <hi>Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is General;</hi> and I question very much, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any, or all of your Enemies, are Masters of
so many <hi>Good Books</hi> as were in your Venture?
And whether there be not more <hi>Trash,</hi> in the
Best of their Shops, than you carry'd to <hi>Ireland?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the <hi>Fairness of your Dealing,</hi> in not employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Setters,</hi> and making use of <hi>Trusty Servants;</hi>
it's proper, that you make your Appeal to the
Publick in your <hi>Last Farewel:</hi> But I am affraid,
you have been <hi>too particular</hi> in that matter, which
can scarcely admit of any excuse, but that it
shews the <hi>Goodness of your Nature;</hi> that not so
much as an <hi>Honest Porter</hi> shall miss his due praise
from you. As to Mr. <hi>Wild,</hi> I perceive, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59888:91"/>
to your Character, he is a <hi>Second Millington;</hi>
so that if you were happy in his Assistance, <hi>he
was happy in your Iustice.</hi> Your design of going
to <hi>Scotland,</hi> I cannot say much to; that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
has labour'd under discouragements, as to
Learning, for many Years, tho it does not want
its proportion of Learned Men; and some of
them you know, as the Lord <hi>Bishop of Salisbury,</hi>
to name no more, make a great Figure in the
World, on that Account: But as I am inform'd,
by the constant intercourse they have with
<hi>London</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> they are pretty well furnisht
with Books; and what they buy, is generally of
the <hi>Best Sort;</hi> so that if you go thither, you must
have an Auction well pick'd, for those that buy
Books there, are either the <hi>Chief of the Gentry,</hi>
who are generally Men of Good Breeding, or
the <hi>Richest of their Clergy,</hi> with whom every thing
will not go down, that is greedily coveted by the
<hi>Wits here.</hi>—And besides, there are so many of their
own <hi>Booksellers,</hi> that come hither yearly, that I
question if you will find your account in going thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
except you can afford Extraordinary Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyworths.</p>
                     <p>You talk, <hi>I</hi> perceive, of going to <hi>Rome;</hi> I
hope you don't design to carry <hi>English Books</hi>
there, if you do, you are likely to find a very dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
Market; and for <hi>Latin Books,</hi> such
as they value, the <hi>Continent</hi> can furnish them
cheaper than our Island: But if you will go, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
all the <hi>Trash and Stuff</hi> you can g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t, for that
Auction; the worst that the <hi>London</hi> Booksellers
Shops contains, is good enough for the <hi>Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>re of
Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having done with <hi>Patrick,</hi> and the rest of the
<hi>Scufflers</hi> in <hi>Dublin,</hi> I perceive you now whet
your Pen against <hi>T. F.</hi> and others of the same
kidney in <hi>London;</hi> It's but Just that you should
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59888:91"/>
make Reprisals upon <hi>one to his Face, who has
been so Cowardly as to Attaque you behind your
Back</hi> Envy they say looks Pale, and that seems
to be so much of <hi>T. F</hi>'s quality, that I am affraid
all your <hi>Rhetorick won't be able to make him blush,</hi>
yet I am confident that upon Reading what you
say of him, he must needs have some <hi>Stings
within,</hi> or else his Case is worse than was that
of either the <hi>first or second Spira.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The great Number of Books you have Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
may very well be allowed in part of an
<hi>Apology</hi> for some Trash, and I question whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any of your Adversaries have printed as
many <hi>Good Books,</hi> in proportion, as you have
done. Your Ingenuous Confession, <hi>that you don't
approve of all you have Printed,</hi> ought also to
be allowed as another part of your <hi>defence,</hi>
and I think the practise of some of the Trade
(to print what they can get a Penny by) may
very well be allowed to Compleat it, as far
as the Case will admit of a defence; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whatever <hi>Rigid Casuists</hi> may do, it ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
Book-sellers to hit any such thing in
your Teeth: <hi>Let him that is without Guilt in that
Respect, throw the first stone</hi> at you. But I find
<hi>T. F.</hi> is not the Man that must begin, you
have by <hi>a just Providence hit a Blot in his Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutchion;</hi>
by which, I suppose, you have him at
Command, and can Charge him with <hi>a down-right
Cheat upon the World,</hi> if he be not so wise
as (with <hi>Merry-Andrew</hi> on the <hi>Stage) to Eat
his Pudding and hold his Tongue.</hi> What you say
as to your General Practice in the <hi>Way of Dealing,</hi>
I conceive, to be so Universally known, that
few will offer to contradict you; Nor can any
Man in Justice upbraid, or be angry with you,
for disposing your Stock to the best advantage,
by <hi>Auction or otherwise:</hi> These are but <hi>Snarles,</hi>
                        <pb n="156" facs="tcp:59888:92"/>
and the ordinary effects of Envy in ill Men, who
Grudge to see others thrive better than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                     <p>I come now to your <hi>second Spira,</hi> whereof
you have given such <hi>a full and Satisfactory</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that I am of opinion, no thinking Man
can hence forward Entertain an ill thought of
you upon that Head. If it be a <hi>forgery,</hi> it's
none of your making, or contrivance, nor is
there a <hi>Bookseller</hi> in Town would have Refus'd
the Copy upon the <hi>Like Information.</hi> As to
that Person who dealt so <hi>Basely</hi> with you, and
exclaimed against the Book, tho he was <hi>so Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to be a sharer in it,</hi> your Reproof is so <hi>sharp
and pungent, and yet so true and just,</hi> that if he
have any Resentments within his breast, or were
ever accustomed to <hi>Reflect upon his own ways,</hi> I
should not much wonder that he became a true
Subject <hi>for a second</hi> Spira <hi>himself,</hi> if he allow'd
his own Conscience a free Parley; All that I
can say further is this, that you have laid it
<hi>fairly at the Methodizers Door,</hi> and that of <hi>I. S.</hi>
the <hi>Divine, who gave him the Information,</hi> if they
won't Vindicate themselves, you were not in
that oblig'd to bear them Company. The <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of your self</hi> on this Head, was certainly
Necessary, and you have perform'd it so well,
that were any Friend of mine <hi>engaged in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
of the like Nature,</hi> I could not tell where to
recommend him to a <hi>better Second</hi> than your
self: You needed not have been at the trouble
of such an Asseveration, that this Defence is
the <hi>product of your own Pen,</hi> for I am satisfied
every body that knows you, will be ready e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to believe it.</p>

SIR,</p>
                     <p>I am sorry that to the ill Treatment you have
met with from <hi>Patrick Campbel,</hi> you should have
that of other unjust Men added, <hi>who have Bought
what they won't Pay for;</hi> It is but just the <hi>Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>s</hi> and
they should reckon when you are gone, seeing
they would not come to an account with your
self: <hi>I</hi> am glad however that they cannot plead
<hi>your own Example as a President,</hi> and that no Man
can charge you with any thing you have not paid
for: <hi>Honesty is always Vniform, and the same in</hi>
Ireland <hi>as in</hi> England, and therefore it is that the
Provocations you have met with, have not been
able to make any change upon you, or to influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
you to return <hi>Evil for Evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Your Grateful <hi>Remembrance of your Friends</hi>
that incouraged your Auctions, does in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
bespeak more of the <hi>Iustice of your Temper,</hi>
than of your digestedness of thought. It had
been sufficient to have named some of the most
Eminent, and to have included the rest with an
&amp;c. Neither do <hi>I</hi> know how some of them may
take it, to have their <hi>Characters</hi> published in this
method; <hi>Modesty is a tender quality, and will soon
be offended:</hi> The kindness of your heart must be
your best Apology, and to such as know you, it
will be excuse enough; but you ought to have
remembred, that there's something else in the
old Proverb of <hi>Killing with Kindness,</hi> than a mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
Pleasing: It cannot however be supposed, that
you have any sordid design in these <hi>Encomiums,</hi>
now that your Auctions are over, and that your
<hi>next Ramble</hi> is design'd elswhere, and therefore
all that can be said for it is this, That whereas
some Men are troubled with an <hi>Over-flowing of
the Gall,</hi> you are troubled with the contrary Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper,
if the saying be true, that <hi>jecore Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi>
It may perhaps, be ill taken by those of the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59888:93"/>
                        <hi>Higher sort of your Friends,</hi> that you should joyn
so many of an <hi>Inferiour Rank,</hi> as sharers with them
in your <hi>Valedictory Elogiums;</hi> but <hi>I</hi> see no great
Reason for it: No Man can live without the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
of the meanest Vulgar, and therefore Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
obliges us to <hi>owe no Man any thing but Love.</hi>
But it seems, you have a mind to Supererrogate,
and to owe none of that neither, <hi>but to pay it all
before hand, or on sight: I</hi> must confess, that for
my own share, <hi>I</hi> never could think there was any
thing of Barbarity or want of Cultivation in that
Good Nature of some of the <hi>Indians,</hi> which Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers
ridicule them for, <hi>viz.</hi> That they will
not only enquire, after the Welfare of their
Friends and their Families, but <hi>very kindly ask,
how their Horses and their Dogs do;</hi> which in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
includes this principle of Natural Justice
in it, That we ought to be <hi>Grateful to all sorts of
Creatures, that yield us Lawful Profit or Pleasure:</hi>
And thus <hi>I</hi> bid <hi>Farewel, to your Farewel to all
your</hi> Dublin <hi>Friends.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I come next to your <hi>Project of Rambling,</hi> as to
which <hi>I</hi> must tell you, <hi>That you have Rambled more
with your head in one Year, than you will be able to do
with your Heels in seven;</hi> therefore would advise
you to make use of the <hi>Curb</hi> a little, and not to
be altogether on the <hi>Spur.</hi> You say, <hi>Your Raven
was gone to Roost, a pretty while ago;</hi> and I know
no reason why his Master should Ramble. But if
the <hi>sight of four Kingdoms, and the Marrying of two
Wives,</hi> be not enough to qualify this <hi>Rambling
Humour,</hi> you must rectify your <hi>Geography</hi> a little
better, and not Talk of <hi>Crossing the</hi> Hellespont
<hi>to see</hi> Greece, for you must either Sail by <hi>Greece,</hi>
or travel through it, before you can come at the
<hi>Hellespont,</hi> except you design to take a round,
and to repay the <hi>Czar his Visit;</hi> or if you be for a
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59888:93"/>
nearer cut, Sail down the <hi>Danube,</hi> and fall into
the <hi>Black-Sea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Methinks, the <hi>Good Entertainment</hi> you boast of
at home, should intice you to stay there; <hi>If</hi> Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leria's
<hi>Arms be so Charming,</hi> She shall, if she take
my advice, transform them into <hi>Chains,</hi> and
hold you so fast, that you shall not have leave to
stir; if Love won't oblige her to it, <hi>I</hi> am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
that Fear shall; <hi>And therefore</hi> Valeria, <hi>for
it's to you that I now address my self, Don't trust the
Raven too often abroad; You know that</hi> Noah<hi>'s when
once sent out, never came in again; and for any
thing I perceive, yours has a great mind to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
his; it was beyond the Hellespont where that
was let loose, and I don't know, if yours once pass the</hi>
Dardanelles, <hi>but they may meet, and so ramble on,
and never think of returning to their Roost again;</hi>
Noah<hi>'s has none to return to, except it be an old rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
piece of the Ark on the Mountains of</hi> Arrarat, <hi>or
as some say, of</hi> Armenia; <hi>and I am satisfied, the
Raven in</hi> Jewin-street <hi>has better quarters: If no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else will prevail with him to stay and roost there,
tell him, That</hi> Noah<hi>'s Raven feeds upon Carrion;
and you know very well, by his rejecting</hi> Dorinda's
Billet Doux, <hi>that he hates such entertainment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now <hi>I</hi> return again to your <hi>Husband,</hi> &amp; must
tell him, <hi>He exposes your Vertue too much, first, by
Rambling from you;</hi> and then by giving such a
High Commendation of you, as were enough,
but that you are beyond the reach of <hi>Temptation,</hi>
to endanger you, or at least, to make you <hi>run</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretia<hi>'s
Fate.</hi>—Wherefore <hi>Sir,</hi> Let me tell
you, that as some will charge you with <hi>imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence</hi>
in troubling the World with an account of
<hi>your Happiness in two Wives successfully,</hi> when
there are so many Thousands, that to their grief,
can never say, they were happy in one; if any mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
should befal you on that account, you
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59888:94"/>
must blame your own Imprudence for it.—Had
<hi>Tarquin</hi> never heard any thing of <hi>Lucretia</hi>'s <hi>Vertue
and Beauty,</hi> he would never have tempted her;
and therefore my advice to you is, <hi>To stay at home
and guard your Treasure,</hi> and don't both Fare well,
and cry Roast Meat too. Remember the Old
Saying,

                           <p>SEpt. 5th. 1698.—I Received a Letter sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
<hi>Dorinda,</hi> but am wholly a
Stranger both to <hi>your Person and Meaning</hi>—your
two Hours—your Time and Place—are
<hi>Arabick</hi> to me, who approve of no <hi>Assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations</hi>
but what are Just; and therefore
'tis very certain your Letter was wrong
directed, and should have gone to some of
your Leud Companions, who in your Drink
(<hi>for there are such Monsters as drunken Women</hi>)
or by the likeness of Garb, you mistook
for me—or perhaps you're some <hi>Suburb Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence,</hi>
who would abuse an Honest Man
in <hi>hopes of getting a Penny</hi> to conceal your
Slanders. If this is your Design (as I am
told 'tis usual with common Strumpets)
you are as much <hi>mistaken in my Humour,
as you are in my Person,</hi> and therefore go
about your Business; <hi>for till you're Vertuous
I can't Love ye, and 'tis not in my Nature to
fear any Thing.</hi> But you say you'l be <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
with me, if I fly your Leud Embraces,
and that (if I don't meet you) I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
when 'twill be too late, the slight Value
I have for you:</hi> but (I Thank God) my
<hi>Vertue is Proof against all your Charms,</hi> and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:59888:97"/>
my Innocence such, as I challenge you to
do your worst. But though the <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>
you threaten, no ways affects me, yet
if you carry on your Jest farther, 'twill
be fatal to Mr. S—, as he's the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Person in <hi>Dublin,</hi> that knows me by
the Name of <hi>Philaret,</hi> and must expect
(upon the least Occasion) to bear the
<hi>scandal of being your Friend</hi>—As to your
Care in concealing your Leudness (<hi>for
you say you're afraid of your watchful</hi> Argus)
it no ways obliges me, I should more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
to hear that such a wanton (as your
<hi>Billet</hi> shews you to be) had broke the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
Fetters, and was kneeling to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
for Pardon; though if he denies it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
you have no Reason to Pout; for if <hi>Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
Wives</hi> will C—d their Husbands,
and invent new Fashions (and frisking
Strains) of Disobedience, which their
Holy Ancestors (and for ought we find in
the Word) even the worst of Women ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr'd;
why should not their Husbands,
either send 'em to the <hi>House of Correction,
or suit 'em with new Forms of Discipline:</hi>
To what end else are they to <hi>dwell with 'em
as Men of Knowledge?</hi> Doth this Knowledge,
think ye, import nothing but <hi>Pusillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi>
and Patience? <hi>Is the Husband God's
Vicegerent for nothing? And can he not be a
Saint, unless a Fool too?</hi> But though the
cold Water your Leudness has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Argus</hi> Affection is enough to extinguish
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:59888:98"/>
it, yet <hi>the way to Amendment is never out of
date;</hi> and who knows, if you prove <hi>as
kind a Wife as you have been to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
but <hi>Argus</hi> may be yet Happy. But he
is Flesh and Blood as well as you, and
therefore, except of a Wanton you become
Chaste, he were better Travel than live
with a W—r; if you think of Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
fling your self at your Husbands
Feet; <hi>Tears in your Eyes may carry the Cause,
where a Husband is Iudge?</hi> Without this,
you do but dissemble with God and Man,
neither can <hi>Argus</hi> think you Repent, till
you discover your Leud Haunts, and the
Names of those that have defil'd his Bed;
to act thus, is to shake Hands with your
Master Sin (<hi>which I find is Lust</hi>) and in
some measure to repair the Damage you
have done to Religion by your Whorish
Intreagues. As this will prove your Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
so 'twill make <hi>Argus</hi> forget your
former Leudness, and if he's <hi>a generous
Husband,</hi> never to mention 'em more. And
<hi>Argus,</hi> if she thus repents, prithee receive
her again—for <hi>what knowest thou, O Husband,
whether thou shalt save thy Wife?</hi>
                              <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 16.</note> Neither are these ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Reflections (<hi>my own</hi> Dorin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,
<hi>as you call your self</hi>) for there is no Faith
in Sin, and I ought to slight a Friendship
which can't be true, and would end in the
Ruine of Soul and Body; <hi>Then go and Sin

nor suffer your Aversion to <hi>Argus</hi> to spread
abroad, for a Quarrel Conceal'd, is half
Cur'd—I have only to add, That I wish
you Chaste, and <hi>better Eyes for the Future,</hi>

                     </opener>
                     <p>YOUR Last, with the <hi>Billet Doux,</hi> is
more surprizing to me, than any
thing that happened in your Encounter
with <hi>Patrick Campbel.</hi> I cannot but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail
the hardness of your Fate, that you
should be condemn'd to <hi>Fight with Beasts of
both Sexes:</hi> I find <hi>Ireland</hi> cannot boast of
her being free from the Seed of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
whatever she may say as to her ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
none of those Creatures in Specie;
and were I to choose, I should rather desire
to Inhabit amongst Adders, than <hi>Lewd Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:</hi>
Happy would it be for <hi>Ireland,</hi> if she
could make an exchange of the one for the
other; but so long as the <hi>Popish Clergy</hi> are
suffered to Nestle in such Numbers there,
'tis in vain to hope for it: <hi>Rome</hi> may well be
call'd the <hi>Mother of Harlots,</hi> when it is the
Practice of her Sons, to make as many such
as ever they can.</p>
                     <p>I did not think however, that the <hi>Art
of writing</hi> Billet Douxes, had been so well
understood in <hi>Ireland:</hi> Your <hi>Dorinda seems
to be so very expert in her Trade,</hi> That I fancy
(if there be any thing of Reality in it,
that is to say, if there be not Masculine
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:59888:99"/>
Knavery and Malice at the bottom of it)
She must be some <hi>Abdicated Retainer to our</hi>
London <hi>Play-houses;</hi> or perhaps, the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cast
of some Dead or Reformed Officer,
who having no pay himself, is not able to
retain her: Nay, for any thing that I
know, She may be <hi>the Captain of</hi> Kirk<hi>'s
Troop of Twenty Five, that they say, he had in
that Countrey,</hi> when so many of the Late
King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Atheists were sent to fight
against their Brethren the Papists; for I
can hardly think, a <hi>She-Cit of</hi> Dublin, so
well vers'd in <hi>Ovid de Arte Amandi,</hi> as your
<hi>Dorinda</hi> seems to be.</p>
                     <p>It's true I might Fancy, it were some
<hi>Green-Sickness Nun,</hi> that had gone a Catter-wawling
from her Nunnery, but then it
comes into my mind, that they are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
provided by the Monks and Fryars;
for you have heard, it was an Observation
of <hi>Henry</hi> the 4<hi>th</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> many years ago,
<hi>That the Nunnery was the Barn, and the
Monks the Thrashers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then give me leave to add one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
more, Perhaps it might have been
a Trap of <hi>Patrick</hi>'s laying, and that he had
a mind to try what he could do by Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
since he was not <hi>able to deal with you
by Wit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Had you been caught in the Snare, there
would have been <hi>subject of Triumph,</hi> and
there's no reason to doubt but he would
have Trumpeted your Fame. This can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:59888:100"/>
be accounted Uncharitable, if I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the <hi>true Character</hi> of the Man, for
he that makes <hi>so bold with the last of the Ten
Commandments</hi> (as it appears <hi>Patrick</hi> has
done) cannot be suppos'd to have any
great value for the other Nine: But be
that how it will, <hi>I applaud your Conduct,</hi> and
think you acted the part of an Honest
Man, in returning <hi>such a Sharp and Perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Answer;</hi> and the part of a Prudent
Man, in doing it with those Precautions:
You know I never <hi>Preach up Merit,</hi> and
therefore you will not be offended if I tell
you, <hi>That it was but your Duty:</hi> I am not
unsensible, what many Men in your Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
would have pleaded in <hi>Excuse
of complying with such a Proffer;</hi> but you
knew the danger of yielding to the <hi>Passion
either of Revenge or Lust;</hi> none but Weak
Men and Fools, are Slaves to those Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical
Masters. Besides the <hi>Reward of a
Good Conscience,</hi> your Courage in this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair,
will enhaunce your Value to your
<hi>Family at Home,</hi> or at least, it ought to do so,
if they be not <hi>condemned to perpetual Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I am the more Confirm'd in my
Thoughts, that it was <hi>a Snare</hi> laid for
your Reputation, when I consider <hi>your
way of carrying your self, the plainness of your
Habit, and the influence which your Illness and
late Scuffle must needs have had upon your
outside; and especially, that the Letter was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:59888:100"/>
to your</hi> Auction-Room, for if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
had taken, then there would have
been ground for <hi>Patrick</hi> to have Libell'd
you in the <hi>Irish Flying Post,</hi> and to have
call'd it an <hi>Assignation-Room for Strumpets,</hi>
instead of an <hi>Auction-Room</hi> for Books;
which would have effectually hinder'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Mans frequenting it, who had but the
least value for his Reputation. This is
all I shall say at present, and conclude
with my hearty Wishes, that you may
still continue a <hi>Conquerour over your own
Passions,</hi> as well as over your unjust Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.

                     <p>I Hope you have received <hi>my First,</hi>
which because I think not severe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
I send you a Second. You see I
reject <hi>your Courtship,</hi> as I would shake off
a Toad, or a Snake that should Crawl

that which you proffer'd me under the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

recommend them to your serious Perusal,

Yet I know not but there may be a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

in it, for you see <hi>my Auction affords pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

so generous as to send you them <hi>Gratis.</hi>
You must Pardon me however, if in my
Applications I do something resemble the
<hi>Quack;</hi> that is to say, if I prescribe Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
without seeing the Patient; because
I remember <hi>Solomon</hi> says, <hi>Go not by the
Door of the Harlot, less she intice thee; that
none but Fools follow such, and that the Way
to her House is the Way to Hell and Death.
That the Mouth of a strange Woman is a deep
Pit, and that none but those who are abhorr'd
of the Lord shall fall into it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I wish you would be at the Pains to
Read the <hi>fifth and seventh Chapters of the</hi>
Proverbs. You who are Ladies of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
use to Converse much with your
<hi>Looking-Glass,</hi> and I will assure you, that
there is the best Mirror you can make use
of, it will exactly shew you all your <hi>Spots
and Patches.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I doubt not, but you are troubled with
all the <hi>Infectious Distempers</hi> that attend
those of your Trade; and seeing the best
way to cure Ulcers is to Lance them well,
read this <hi>Treatise of Fornication,</hi> it may
prove of Soveraign use; or if you find it
makes your Wounds smart too much, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the softer Remedy of the <hi>Book of God's
Iudgments against Whoredom,</hi> which being
Historical may please you better perhaps,
and be no less Effectual for working your
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:59888:102"/>
Cure. To make the Pacquet compleat, I
likewise send you another Medicine, call'd
<hi>Concubinage and Polygamy displayed,</hi> which
is an Answer to a Parson, one Mr. <hi>Butler,
who fell out with his Wife, and in with his
Maid,</hi> and therefore muster'd up all the
Arguments he could in Defence of the
more <hi>Genteel Practise of keeping Misses.</hi>
Which you will here find solidly answer'd
and condemn'd, but much more your own
abominable Practise, which seems by your
Letter to be that of a <hi>common Prostitute,</hi>
or next a kin to it.</p>
                     <p>I would offer a <hi>few Arguments,</hi> if it
were possible to reclaim you, and therefore
would pray you to consider that <hi>Vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
dishonours your Body,</hi> makes you despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
in the Eyes of all Men, nay ev'n of
those that haunt you, so that your usual
Reward is an infamous Name, Loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Diseases, Extream Poverty, and an
End suitable to such a vile way of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Then it damns your Soul,</hi> makes you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of receiving any good Advice, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys
the Peace of your Family, if you
have any, brings a Scandal and Disgrace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your Children, reflects shame upon your
Relations, and makes you to be abhorr'd
by all Civil Company.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is against Reason,</hi> for it destroys all
Property, brings a spurious Issue into Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
hinders the Propagation of Mankind,

debases Humane Nature, makes you more
Vile than the Brute Beasts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is against Charity,</hi> not only, because of
the Discord it occasions in Families, but
also because the Children of Whoredom
are many Times murder'd, and continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
neglected, either in their Maintenance
or Education, which is destructive both to
their Souls and Bodies, and upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it was as severely punish'd by the
Canon-Law as Murder.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is against all the Rules of Christianity</hi>—There
being nothing more severely Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
in the Scriptures than Fornication
and Adultery; Persons who continue in
those Practises, being therein declar'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
for the Communion of the Church here,
and of the Saints hereafter; and liable to
Everlasting Damnation: This is so plain,
that I shall not trouble you with quoting
Texts, for you can turn your Eye no

be true, that the Holy Ghost Threatens
<hi>Gods Iudgments upon Whoremongers and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterers,

                     </p>

                     <p>First, <hi>Then in order to the Flying Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
suppress the first Desires of Vncleanness</hi>
that do arise in your Heart. 'Tis easier
(<hi>Dorinda</hi>) to deal with a Spark, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Hold no Dispute against <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>
Temptations to Vncleanness:</hi> To Dispute
with it, is the way to be overcome by it,
hear the Temptation but speak for it self,
and <hi>before you are aware<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> it insinuates it self
into the Bosom of you, and is in your
Heart before you can think it got into
your Head; with an unseen Fire and insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Power, it <hi>melts you into softness,</hi> and
dissolves you into yielding: I say (<hi>Dorinda</hi>)
give it no Consideration, but run away
from it, as <hi>Ioseph did from his Tempting
Mistress.</hi> Had our great Grandmother <hi>Eve</hi>
done so at first with the Devils Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>had she given no Ear to his Words, set
no Eye upon the Fruit, held no Dispute with
him,</hi> but turn'd her self, and gone away
from him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> she had not been the Mother
of so much Sin and Misery, as she hath
been to her Posterity.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Avoid all Things that may exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
provoke to Lust, as Conversation with
Men that are Leud,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Dorinda,</hi> if you

their Words are charming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their
Looks inchanting, <hi>their Kisses killing,</hi> and
their <hi>Glances are Darts to destroy;</hi> there's
Pitch and Birdlime in their Lips and Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and Itch of amorousness of Skin all
over; <hi>you may</hi> (Dorinda) <hi>as well hug a Flame</hi>
without being burnt, as to admit a Leud
Man within your Embraces, and not be
all on Fire with the heat of Lust.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To put many Things together for brevity
sake,</hi> avoid the speaking of any wanton
Words, and if possible the hearing of any
spoken; and be sure write no more <hi>Billet
Douxes,</hi> also the reading of any lascivious
Books or Verses, also the beholding of any
<hi>impure Sights, either of shameful Parts or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>
themselves, or the Pictures of them:
<hi>Avoid also</hi> the being a Spectator of any
<hi>wanton Plays or Shows, Balls, or Dances,</hi> or
other lascivious Revels, which by the
garish Dresses, amorous Words, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
Gestures used therein, do not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct,
but stir up to Uncleanness. These
Things (<hi>Dorinda</hi>) are the great and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Bane of Modesty.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Fly those Vices and subdue those
Passions which encline you to Lust, such as
Drunkenness</hi> (for alas 'tis now become a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine
Vice) <hi>Gluttony, Covetousness, Idleness,
and Curiosity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="223" facs="tcp:59888:106"/>
In the first Place <hi>shun Drunkenness,</hi> for
though the Eye stirs up Lust, 'tis Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness
sets it on Fire; there is but <hi>one step</hi>
(Dorinda) <hi>from excessive Wine to unlawful
Lust. Lot</hi>'s Daughters made their Father
drunk with Wine, and the next News
you hear of him is, that in his Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
he lay with his own Daughters.</p>
                     <p>Again <hi>Dorinda,</hi> if you'd live a Chaste,
Modest Life, you must not <hi>Eat to excess;
Iesurun waxed Fat and Kicked,</hi> that is,
waxed wanton upon his high Feeding; so
<hi>Ier. 5. 8. They were as fed Horses, in the
Morning every one Neighed after his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
Wife</hi>—It is very difficult to Feed
high, and Live chastely; then (<hi>Dorinda</hi>) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
not only the use of all lustful Food,
but all extravagant Feeding on any Meat.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Don't be too much in Love
with Money, <hi>'Tis the Root of all Evil,</hi>
(1 Tim. 6. 10.) There's a huge Power in
Riches to corrupt Chastity, few Women
(if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ut a little amorous) are <hi>Proof against
the blaze of Gold</hi>—How many Women in
<hi>Dublin</hi> (and in <hi>London</hi> too) <hi>prostitute their
Bodies to all Comers, perhaps for a beggarly</hi>

speak) how many Men are there, that
for the <hi>Love of Money</hi> do as it were let
themselves out to hire for Stallions to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the <hi>Lust of some Women;</hi> I suppose ye
have heard of G—<hi>n,</hi> if therefore you're wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to Reform, and to <hi>live chastly,</hi> you must
fly Covetousness.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="224" facs="tcp:59888:107"/>
Again, I'd advise you to avoid <hi>Idleness,</hi>
for Lust (as Bishop <hi>Taylor</hi> observes) <hi>usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
creeps in at those Emptinesses where the Soul
is Vnimployed, and the Body at Ease;</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all Idleness, the Idleness of the <hi>Bed
and Couch</hi> is most hurtful; the <hi>soft Bed</hi> is
the Mother of wanton Thoughts—The
Time when <hi>David</hi> fell a lusting after <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheba</hi>
was in the Evening, after he had
been lolling on his Bed, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 2. And
therefore (<hi>Dorinda</hi>) if you'd live honest,
you must avoid Idleness.</p>
                     <p>In the next Place, I would advise ye
(if you'd live chastly) to <hi>make a Covenant
with your Eyes; have a chaste Eye and a Hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                        </gap>or it is all one (saith Bishop <hi>Taylor</hi>) with
what Part of the Body we commit Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery;
what though I have rejected to C—d
<hi>Argus,</hi> yet if I let my Eye loose, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the Lust of that, I am an Adulterer;
for our Saviour saith—<hi>Look not upon a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to Lust after her;</hi> the Eye is a great
Inflamer of Lust; we read of Eyes full of
Adultery (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 14.) <hi>Ioseph's</hi> Mistress
first cast her Eye upon <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and then she
said <hi>Lye with me,</hi> Gen. 39. 7. Beauty is a
dangerous Thing, therefore when you see
a Handsome Man (especially at Church, if
you ever go there) take heed of <hi>Eying him
too much,</hi> stare not upon him; you may as
well face a Basilisk, as a pretty Face.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Dorinda,</hi> these Directions, if care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
heeded, will be a means to keep you

then,</p>
                     <p>

take Meat <hi>like Medicines,</hi> no more then

(<hi>as on hard Stones, with bare Knees</hi>)
or else by wearing Sackcloth, or Hair

'tis much better to Afflict your self for a
while, than be <hi>lash'd</hi> by Satan forever in Hell.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Meditate on those Things, as
may by poring on them curb your Lust;
and here, <hi>Dorinda,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> Consider the falls of those who
have miscarried in this way, as of <hi>Iane
Shore, Creswel, Nel G—n,</hi> &amp;c. Women fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
in their Generations for Wit and
Beauty; and yet see (<hi>Dorinda</hi>) to what
weakness of Body, and poorness of Spirit
they were brought to by this Sin.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Consider the Constancy of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that have continued Chaste, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
their Temptations to Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness;
the most remarkable one that
I can think-of, is that of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> Recorded
in <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 7, to 13. <hi>He was tempted</hi> to it
by his Mistress, who had some Power to
command him, and many ways to oblige
him, yet he <hi>consented not. He was temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to it,</hi> not by Looks and Glances, Hints
and Intimations, (any of which were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
with too many in these our Days,
to draw them to it) but with downright
Words, she plainly and boldly said to him,
<hi>Lie with me;</hi> and <hi>yet he consented not. He
was tempted to it</hi> by her, not once or twice
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:59888:108"/>
only, (for Tryal of him, as might be
thought) but many times, to shew she
was in earnest; she was often at it with
him, tempting him, she <hi>spake to</hi> Joseph
<hi>day by day, and yet he consented not. He
was tempted to it</hi> by her, not at unseasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
times only, while Company was at
home, whereby they might be discovered
and descryed, but at a time of greatest
seasonableness and opportunity, when he
might act the thing with greatest Secrecy
and Security, when he had business to do
within the House, and <hi>there was none of the
Men of the House there within;</hi> and <hi>yet he
consented not. He was tempted to it</hi> by her,
not only by winning Speech, but by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing
Action; she not only used Speech
to him, but laid hands on him, she caught
him by his Garment, saying, <hi>Lie with me,</hi>
and <hi>yet he consented not.</hi> Here (<hi>Dorinda</hi>) is
an Example of Constancy and Chastity
worthy of your Imitation. Not much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
was that which St. <hi>Hiero<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of a Son of a <hi>King of Nicomedia,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Bed whereon he was tied, by an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure
Curtesan</hi> with all the Arts, and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of Luxury, lest the ease of his
posture should abuse him to a yielding to
her Temptations, bit off his Tongue, and
spit it in her Face. <hi>Dorinda,</hi> if such Chaste
Examples as these be made familiar to
your Mind by frequen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Meditation on

them, they will help you toward the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
over Uncleanness.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Bethink with thy self a while
(<hi>Dorinda</hi>) when thou art under <hi>Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to Vncleanness,</hi> what a business that
Face is, which thou so doatest upon, and
the Consideration thereof, will very much
<hi>allay thy heat, and cool thy desire,</hi> and even
dash thee out of Countenance. For there
is nothing certainly that so much <hi>master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the desire of the Fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>sh, as to think what
that which one loveth, is, after once it be dead.</hi>
And the Experience hereof, we have in
that <hi>Hermit,</hi> who understanding that a
Woman, whom he was too too much ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured
on, was Dead, went by Night to
her Grave, and having opened it, with
the Lap of his Mantle wiped away some
of the filth of the dead Corps, being half
rotten, and when afterwards he found
himself possess'd with any unlawful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
he laid abroad his foul and stinking
Mantle, and said thus to himself; <hi>Go to
now, see what it is that thou dost desire, and
take thy fill of it.</hi> By which means his heat
was cooled, and his Lust quenched.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Seventhly, Dorinda,</hi> consider that
you cannot Act this Sin, but there will be
<hi>Eyes</hi> upon you.</p>
                     <p>First, <hi>The Eye of God</hi> is upon you, <hi>The
Eyes of the Lord are in every Place,</hi> as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>

of any such Fact. And who that

have the Confidence to do any such
thing?</p>
                     <p>In a Fury, or for some politick Purpose,
such a like thing as this may be acted in
the presence of a Man; as it once hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where a <hi>Tarlaquin</hi>
transported with beastly Fury, ran at a
Woman <hi>as she came out of the Stove,</hi> threw

all the Resistance she made, had <hi>carnal
Knowledge</hi> of her in the presence of many
Spectators. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

at any Time, when you come under the
Temptations of Lust, call to mind <hi>Death,
Iudgment, Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> and you will
(by God's Grace) be so wrought on in

And how <hi>Dorinda,</hi> you may perhaps

They that Honour God, will Honour his

                     <p>I Have perused your <hi>second Letter to the</hi>
Irish <hi>Dorinda,</hi> and am of Opinion she
never met with such returns to her Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
before. It's not probable, that she
will trouble <hi>Philaret</hi> any more with her
<hi>Billet Douxes,</hi> and it were to be wished she
never troubled any Body else with them.
You have done <hi>your Part to cure her Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper,</hi>
but that Disease in the Soul is
too often like the Gout in the Body: <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrium

                     <p>You have however discharged your Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

for you have <hi>touch'd on most of the Ordinary

reach a Conviction, she will not grudge
to read the <hi>Treatises</hi> you have recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Mr. <hi>Carr's Antidote against Lust,</hi> 'tis

will further inform her Judgment, and

convince her of the vileness of her Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise.</p>
                     <p>I am glad that you have left behind you
in <hi>Dublin such Proofs of your fair way of deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

rendred the <hi>English Conquest</hi> of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
more Universal and Effectual, than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

                     <p>I have nothing else to say, but that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
when this <hi>Billet Doux</hi> comes to see

not that your <hi>Person and Purse</hi>

                     <p>Your Design of putting it in Print, I
cannot disapprove; it (shews your Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence

Wo are taught from Scripture, that—<hi>Marriage
is honourable in all Men, so is not a
single Life;</hi> in some it is a Snare, and a Trouble
in the Flesh, a Prison of unruly Desires, which
is attempted daily to be broken; <hi>A single Life<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>

                              </hi>
is never commanded, but in some Cases Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
is; for he that (<hi>like Dorinda) cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
must Marry;</hi> and he that can contain, is not
tyed to a single Life, but may Marry very law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully:
<hi>Marriage was ordain'd by God, instituted
in Paradice;</hi> was the relief of a natural Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
and the first Blessing from God himself:
He gave to Man <hi>not a Friend, but a Wife, that
is a Friend and a Wife too.</hi> It is the Seininary
of the Church, and daily bring forth Sons and
Daughters unto God. Our Blessed Lord, tho'
he was <hi>born of a Maiden,</hi> yet she was Vailed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the cover of Marriage, and she was Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to—<hi>A WIDDOWER</hi>—for <hi>Ioseph,</hi> the
supposed Father of our Lord, had Children by a
former Wife. <hi>The first Miracle</hi> that ever Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
did, was to do Honour to a Wedding—Marriage
was in the World before Sin, and
has been in all Ages of the World the greatest
Antidote against it, and although Sin hath sowr'd
Marriage, and stuck the Man's Head with Cares,
and the Womans Bed with Sorrow in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of Children,</hi> yet these are but <hi>throws of
Life and Glory;</hi> and she shall be saved in <hi>Child-bearing,</hi>
if she be found in <hi>Faith and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>—So
that Marriage is the proper Scene of
Piety and Patience, of the Duty of Parents,
and the Charity of Relatives; here Kindness is
expanded, and Love is united, and made firm
as a Center—<hi>Marriage is the Nursery of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
                              <pb n="238" facs="tcp:59888:115"/>
the <hi>Virgin</hi> sends Prayers to God, but she
carries but one Soul to him; but the state of
Marriage fills up the <hi>Numbers of the Elect,</hi> and
hath in it the Labour of Love, the <hi>Delicacies of
Friendship,</hi> the Blessing of Society, and the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Hands and Hearts.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And as Marriage is the Nursery of Heaven,
so 'tis the <hi>Mother of the World;</hi> it preserves
Kingdoms, fills Cities, Churches, and Heaven
it self.—Thus (<hi>Dorinda</hi>) have I shewn that
the state you are enter'd into, is <hi>Divine in its
Institution</hi>—Sacred in its Union—Holy in
the Mystery—Honourable in its Appellative—Religious
in its Imployments—It is Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to the Societies of Men, and Holiness
to the Lord, and is certainly preferable to a

                           <p>But <hi>Dorinda,</hi> as happy a State as Marriage
is, <hi>Argus</hi> and you will be ever disappointed in't,
if it ben't <hi>intirely conducted, and over-ruled by
Religion:</hi> None are Happy in Marriage, but
those that invite Christ to the Wedding, this
you did not do, as is clear by your <hi>Billet Doux;</hi>
but I write to you now, as supposing you a
<hi>True Penitent,</hi> so shall adventure to give ye
<hi>Rules,</hi> for your Happy-Living in a Married-state.
<hi>The Rules</hi> I shall Name, shall be only
those that relate to <hi>Argus</hi> and you, in Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
I an't so foolish to think, that all the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
lies on the <hi>Weaker-Vessel,</hi>

                                 </gap>.</note>
or so Barbarous to expect the
Wife should prove obliging, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Husband be so too—<hi>the Obligation is
mutual;</hi>—and therefore prescribe nothing (in
the following Rules) that I think too bitter for
<hi>Argus</hi>'s swallow—</p>
                           <p>Before I give any <hi>Rules</hi> I premise this, that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>is the Duty of all that intend to Marry, seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:59888:115"/>
to read the <hi>Form of Matrimony,</hi> least when
they come to the Church, they Answer there to
what they had not consider'd before-hand, and
then no wonder if they don't Practice a Duty of
a larger extent then they apprehended. But to
proceed to the <hi>Rules, that</hi> Argus <hi>and you must
walk</hi> by, if you'd be yet happy in your Married-state.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>And the first is, that once a Week you read,
and digest the 5th of the</hi> Ephesians, <hi>from the 22d
verse to the end of the Chapter</hi>—All Scripture is
given for your Instruction; and sure I am, all
that Marry before they Love at the rate here
described, commit a very great Sin, and can't
expect the Blessing of God on their Marriage.—'Tis
the Blessing of God Crowns the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and they that Marry without it (be they
ne're so Rich) are but <hi>two tied together to make
one mother miserable.</hi> All that intend to Wed,
would do well to consider, that they who enter
into the State of Marriage cast a Dye of the
greatest Contingency; and yet of the greatest
Interest in the World, next to <hi>the last throw for
Eternity—Life, or Death,</hi> Felicity or a lasting
Sorrow, are in the <hi>Power of Marriage</hi>—A Woman
indeed ventures most, for she hath no Sanctuary
to retire to from an Evil Husband; she must
dwell upon her Sorrow, and hatch the Eggs
which her own Folly or Infelicity hath produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced;
and she is more under it, because her Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentor
hath <hi>a Warrant of Prerogative;</hi> and the
Woman may complain to God as Subjects do of
Tyrant Princes; but otherwise she hath no Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
in the Causes of Unkindness. And though
the Man <hi>(who Marries a Shrew, or such a Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
as</hi> Dorinda <hi>was</hi>) can run from many Hours
of his Sadness, yet he must return to it again,
and when he sits among his Neighbours, he
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:59888:116"/>
members <hi>the Viper that lies in his Bosom,</hi> and he
sighs deeply, as well he may.</p>
                           <p>It is the unhappy chance of many Men, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
great Inconveniences in a <hi>single Life,</hi> to rush
into Marriage, in hopes to remove their Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and there they enter into Fetters, as the
<hi>Staggs in the</hi> Greek <hi>Epigram,</hi> and are bound to
Sorrow by the <hi>Cords of a Mans, or Womans
Peevishness;</hi> and the worst of the Evil is, they
are to thank their own Follies, for they fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Snare by entering an improper Way;
<hi>Christ and the Church</hi> were no Ingredients in their
Choice; but as the <hi>Indian Women</hi> enter into Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the Price of an Elephant, and think their
Crime warrantable; so many chuse for a Rich-Fortune
(<hi>like</hi> Eriphyle <hi>the</hi> Argive, <hi>prefer Gold
before a good Man</hi>) and shew themselves to be
less than Money by over-valuing That, to all the
Content and Happiness of Life; but I Bless God,
I an't of this sordid Temper, for I don't (nor
never did) think, that the Happiness of a Mans
Life, consists in the <hi>Abundance of what he posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;</hi>
but in Gods giving him a Heart to make
a <hi>Sober-use</hi> of what he lends him (I say lends
him) for we are all Stewards to the Great Lord
of Heaven and Earth.</p>
                           <p>And <hi>Dorinda, as He, or She,</hi> deserve to be
disappointed that Marry for Money, so as very
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> Fool is he, that chuses for <hi>Beauty;</hi> who chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
for one (as a Wit express it) <hi>whose Eyes are
Witty, and her Soul Sonsual.</hi> It is an ill Band of
Affections to tie two Hearts together, by <hi>a little
Thred of Red and White.</hi> These <hi>Dorinda</hi> will Love
no longer, but till the next Ague comes, and are
Fond of each other but at the <hi>Chance of Fancy, or
the Small-Pox, or Child-bearing, or Care, or Time,</hi>
or any thing that can destroy a pretty Fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>But it is the basest of all, when <hi>Lust is the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranymph</hi>
                              <pb n="241" facs="tcp:59888:116"/>
and solicites the Suit, makes the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
and joins the Hands. This <hi>Dorinda</hi> was
your own Case, and is commonly the Effect of
the former Folly; according to the Proverb—At
first for his <hi>fair Checks and comely Beard,</hi> the
Beast is taken for a Lyon, but at last he is turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to a Dragon, or a Leopard, or a Swine.
<hi>That which at first is Beauty on the Face, may
prove Lust in the Manners.</hi> He, or She, that looks
too curiously upon the Beauty of the Body, <hi>looks
too low,</hi> hath Flesh and Corruption in his Heart,
and is judged Sensual and Earthly in his Desires.
Sure I am, no Marriage will prove Happy, that
is not Blessed with <hi>Religious Affections.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Another Thing in which I conceive</hi> Dorinda <hi>and</hi>
Argus <hi>to be equally concerned</hi> (if they'd be Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
in Wed-lock) <hi>is, To avoid as much as possible
all Offences of each other in the beginning of their
new Honey-Moon</hi> (for so I may call it, <hi>Dorinda</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>run</hi> astray) every little Thing can blast an
<hi>Infant-Blossom,</hi> and an unkind Word or careless
Carriage, is apt to give the Alarm at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of this Union—People generally at
first are <hi>watchful, and observant, careful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive,</hi>
and even the smaller failures of Chance
or Weakness, are then Interpreted as want of
Love, and usually affright the <hi>unexperienced
Man, or Woman,</hi> who make unequal Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
and Fancy mighty Sorrows by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions
of any new and early Unkindness—<hi>Plutarch</hi>
compares a <hi>new Marriage</hi> to a Vessel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Hoops are on, every little thing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
the Union of its Parts, but when the
Joints are stiffen'd, and the whole tied toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by a <hi>firm compliance, and proportionate bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
it is then hardly dissolved without Violence
or Burning: In like manner (<hi>Dorinda</hi>) when
once the Hearts of a <hi>Man and Wife</hi> are endear'd
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:59888:117"/>
and hardned by a mutual <hi>Confidence, Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>
and <hi>Experience</hi> (longer then Artifice or
Pretence can last) I word it so, for Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
do not manifest themselves in the <hi>first
Scenes,</hi> but in the Succession of a long Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
there is then no great Danger; and there
are <hi>many things Past, and some things Present,</hi>
which will dash all little Unkindnesses in Pieces.</p>
                           <p>And therefore (<hi>Dorinda</hi>) in the next Place,
I think <hi>Argus and you</hi> should be very careful
(at your first Reconcilation especially) to <hi>stifle</hi>
all little Differences, and to cut them down as
fast as they spring up; for if they are suffered
to grow, they render the <hi>Society troublesome</hi> by
their Numbers, and the <hi>Affections become loose
by an habitual Vneasiness</hi>—Some People are more
vext with a <hi>Fly, then with a Wound;</hi> nor can
Reason be always upon the Guard, in the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
little Accidents of a Family, but <hi>trifling
Troubles,</hi> if often repeated, will be apt to render
you restless, and betray you to Passion; and at
last to beget an indifferency, if not a Disgust
and Aversation.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Lastly, Dorinda,</hi> if you'd (<hi>be happy in Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
and would</hi>) have <hi>Argus</hi> Love ye again, be
extreamly watchful against all curious Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of—<hi>Mine and Thine</hi>—for this has caused
all the Laws, Suits, and Wars in the World.
<hi>Let them who have but one Person, have also but
one Interest;</hi> for when either of them begins to
impropriate, it is like a <hi>Swelling in the Flesh,</hi>
which draws more then its share, and what it
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>eeds on turns to a Bile, and a Sore. <hi>Dorinda
you shine by your Husbands Honour, and will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be darkned if he suffer an Eclipse; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
'tis your Interest, as well as Duty</hi> (if <hi>Argus</hi>
be kind and loving) to contribute to his <hi>case
and welfare; the Vse and Imployment</hi> of what
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:59888:117"/>
Man and Wife possess, should be common to
both their Necessities, and in this there is no
other Difference of Right, but that the Man has
the <hi>Dispensation of all,</hi> and may (as a late Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
expresses it) keep it from his Wife, as a
Governour of a Town may keep it from the
right Owner; he hath the Power, but not Right
to do so.</p>
                           <p>But (<hi>Dorinda</hi>) you have nothing to fear
here, for if <hi>Argus</hi> be a kind Husband, you may
<hi>do with him what ye List; or if</hi> Argus <hi>Rules, 'tis
because you would obey, and in so obeying you Rule
as much as he;</hi> for my own share, I have been
Married twice, and was ever so much for a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Endearment (and against the vile <hi>Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of Mine and Thine,</hi> that I could never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,
except there were Reason for it) of
keeping of <hi>two Purses: No! She that keeps my Heart,

a distrust on one side or other; and sure I
am, <hi>Distrust is the Bane of Love:</hi> And <hi>Dorinda,</hi>
when it once appears (but I hope you'll ne're
more give occasion for't); <hi>farewel to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of Matrimony.</hi> 'Twas such a Trust as this,
I repos'd in my first Wife; and therefore she
loved me to that Degree, that I judged it my
Duty to <hi>settle her presently</hi> in all I had (for
'twas she, and not her Fortune I Married,) <hi>that
I might give at the Rate I loved her;</hi> nay, I was so
desirous to requite her Tenderness, that I was
scarce contented with giving all; but grudged
(as I once told her) <hi>my Fun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>ral Expences, my
very Shroud and Grave,</hi> that I might adde to
her Future Store—<hi>Dorinda,</hi> I need not press
ye to believe this, for Men in their <hi>Last-Wills</hi>
appear just as they are, they here grow open
and plain hearted, and <hi>dare not depart with their
Hands to a Lye;</hi> and as this was my Carriage to
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:59888:118"/>
my First Wife, so 'tis no more than I owe to
This, <hi>or if possible, a greater Tenderness.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thus, <hi>Dorinda,</hi> have I shewn ye (from my own
Experience) how <hi>Argus and you may fall a love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
again, and be yet happy in a Married-state;</hi>
and if ye follow the <hi>Rules</hi> I have sent ye, I shall
think my Labour very well bestowed.</p>
                           <p>And now <hi>Dorinda,</hi> having brought ye to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi>
I leave ye in his tender Arms, where

                     <p>I Have received your <hi>Third to Dorinda,</hi> who
I suppose will scarcely thank you for your
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:59888:118"/>
                        <hi>Good Advice;</hi> if she bestow the Perusal upon it,
which I much doubt. In my Opinion you have
<hi>over-done the Matter, your first was enough, your
second by Consequince too much, and your third must
needs be superfluous.</hi> I am satisfied, <hi>Dorinda</hi> is
of my mind, so that there's two to one against
you. <hi>As many Men, and as few Reproofs as can
be, suits Women of her Temper best.</hi> Did her
Husband know you, I am certain he would think
you deserv'd a <hi>Pair of Gloves, and a Wedding
Dinner,</hi> better than the Parson that Join'd him
and his unfaithful <hi>Dorinda</hi> in the Bands of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;
for I am satisfied, he did not read her <hi>a
Lecture so long by one half;</hi> and If I say, not half
so much to the Purpose neither, there are Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the World will vouch for the Truth of
it.</p>
                     <p>I think the <hi>Method</hi> you took with <hi>Dorinda</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Genuine and Natural, <hi>first to lay before her the
Wickedness of defiling the Marriage-Bed, and then
to endeavour to possess her with honourable Thoughts
of it.</hi> But I am of the mind, she will give an equal
Ear to both, that is to say, she will not hear one
Word of either. If her Husband had been an
<hi>Argus</hi> as you suppose, I can't see how she could
have found out a Place, <hi>secret enough to write her
Billet Doux in;</hi> and I am verily of Opinion,
except he be one of those whom <hi>Iuvenal</hi> calls
<hi>Doctus spectare Lacunar,</hi> he must needs think the
<hi>Peacecks Tail a much finer Ornament than the Rams-Head;</hi>
but perhaps he finds it to be true, what
<hi>Aesop</hi> says, that it is <hi>easier to take a Bag of Fleas
set them a Grazing all day, and gather them into
their Bag at night again, than to keep Guard over an
Vnchaste Woman;</hi> and being over-watch'd, his
Hundred Eyes fell asleep all at once, and so <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda</hi>
took the opportunity of making a Sally.</p>
                     <p>If your <hi>Third Letter</hi> have so much Influence,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:59888:119"/>
as to create in her a better Opinion of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and make her <hi>more faithful to his Bed;</hi>
then he may sleep securely with <hi>Two Hundred
Eyes,</hi> if he had them, and I am sure, it is no
fault of yours, if it does not.</p>
                     <p>I shall not trouble you with <hi>long Remarks upon
your Letter,</hi> only your hint of <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s having
been a <hi>Widdower,</hi> when he was Espoused to the
<hi>Virgin;</hi> puts me in the Head to ask you this
Question, Whether his Hose which they shew
at <hi>Aix la Chappelle, be of the first or second Wives
making?</hi> And in which of their Times it was he
gave the <hi>Hem,</hi> when Playing the Carpenter, which
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has got pent up in a Bottle,
as a precious Relick?</p>
                     <p>I Congratulate the <hi>Happiness of your</hi> Wife <hi>in
so Chaste an Husband;</hi> nor do I see how she can
be quits with you by less than <hi>an Ocean of Love
and Respect.</hi> She had best spit in her Hand and
take fast hold, for if she should drop, you have
<hi>magnified Widdowers so much in the Person of</hi>
Joseph, that all the Virgins in the Town can
do no less than proffer themselves to you to call
out one of their number for your <hi>Third.</hi> Yet I
am not willing to think that any thing of this is
at the bottom of your Plot, I hope you are no
such <hi>designing Man.</hi> I shall take my leave of you,
and heartily Wish, that <hi>every Dorinda may meet
with such a</hi> Philaret. And that all the good
Women in the City, had such Husbands as your
self. I am.</p>

from <hi>a Person in Dublin,</hi> to whom I never offer'd

The occasion of my first going into this Kingdom,
is so well known, and manifestly lawful, that I
shall not so much as hint at it in this place: But how
my <hi>Conversation</hi> has been, while I resided there, is
the task that lies now upon me to set forth in a
true Light; which I will do with such sincerity, that
I will even <hi>dissect my Breast to you;</hi> and at the same
time make (not only <hi>Your Ladyship,</hi> but) the <hi>WHOLE
WORLD</hi> my Confessor: But still, with this Restri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
as far as my frail Nature and weak Memory
will permit me; and where that's defective, if any
where Invention has supply'd it, I hope you'll excuse
it. For <hi>Madam,</hi> you'll find (at least they will that

The first of these Heads, which <hi>respects God,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
all the Duties of Religion; which is a
thing in this Age admits of so many <hi>several Modes
and Forms,</hi> that without some further Explanation,
it is difficult to know what is meant by it. For a

next question is, <hi>Pray what Religion are you of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is a sense of our Duty to God, and the W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to him, according to the best of our Vnderstandings, in
order to the obtaining of a blessed Immortality.</hi> And
this likewise consists in two parts; <hi>First,</hi> in its <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;</hi>
and <hi>Secondly,</hi> in putting those Principles in
<hi>Practice;</hi> For Principles without <hi>Practice,</hi>

They may indeed by a <hi>Profession</hi> of Religion,
deceive others; but without the <hi>Practice</hi> of it, they
more fatally deceive themselves. I will therefore,
Madam, in the first place, shew you what my <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>

whatever their particular Perswasions are. And
conformable to this Opinion, was <hi>my Practice in

Dublin. One Sunday I heard Dr. Stern, another Mr.</hi>
Sinclare, <hi>a third Mr.</hi> Searl, <hi>a fourth Mr.</hi> Boyse, <hi>a
fifth Mr.</hi> Weld, <hi>a sixth the Anabaptist in</hi> Francis-street.
And <hi>when</hi> William Penn <hi>came thither, I went
with the crowd to hear him:</hi> For when I think of
<hi>George Keith</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>William Dobbs</hi> in <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
(Two Persons of Great Sense, and as strict Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice)
I must think <hi>that some Quakers are</hi> Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
and, for ought I know, we contend with 'em
about Words, while we think the same thing: Sure
I am, their <hi>Celebrated Light within,</hi> is what we call
the <hi>Dictates of Conscience;</hi> and if we could but get
'em to <hi>Baptism and the Lord's Supper,</hi> we should
begin to call 'em Brethren. And thus you see, by
my going one <hi>Sunday</hi> to one Perswasion, and a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
to another, <hi>that I can go to Heaven with any
Wind, and with any Name;</hi> and shall think it an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
to go into <hi>Canaan,</hi> tho it were through a Red
Sea.</p>
                  <p>(Madam,) <hi>'Tis true I was born to travel, and am

Length of the Map, and never see you here, yet I

another). <hi>Men go to</hi> China <hi>both by the</hi> Streights <hi>and
by the</hi> Cape. The Good Men of <hi>Ireland (such as
Bishop</hi> King, <hi>and Mr.</hi> Boyse) perhaps, contend about
words, when they heartily think the same thing.
But whatever the Opinions of others are in Polemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

<hi>I am, or should be, an Honest Man;</hi> for Vertue is my
Business; my Writing is my Recreation: (<hi>which

                  <p>In the next place, Madam, I shall give you a <hi>short
Diary of my Practice in</hi> Ireland, with respect to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
but I will first <hi>give you a Relation of a Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
I had with a sort of Atheist I met in</hi> Dublin.</p>
                  <p>I need not tell ye, Madam, That <hi>Atheism</hi> and <hi>Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion</hi>
abounds every where, (<hi>for your last Letter
suggested as much</hi>) and the cause is apparent; for
when Men have given themselves up so long to the
Conduct of their <hi>own Lusts,</hi> that they have Reason
to fear the Justice of God due to <hi>'em for their Sins,</hi>
they would fain hope to secure themselves, by <hi>deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Being:</hi> I can't say this <hi>Lewd Fellow</hi> I met in
<hi>Dublin,</hi> absolutely deny'd the <hi>Being of a God;</hi> (and
I much question whether there be a profest Atheist
in the World;) yet I may say <hi>his Discourses</hi> (as well
as his manner of living) <hi>had so much of Atheism in
'em,</hi> as they made me tremble: I won't insert his
<hi>Atheistical Discourses,</hi> for they are better forgot than
publish'd; but I'll send you <hi>some of the Arguments</hi> I
us'd to refute his Atheistical Notions: Whether they
satisfy'd him or not, I can't say, for he made little
reply: I am sure my design was good; but whether
I argued as I ought, I leave you, Madam, to judge;
<hi>what I advanc'd, was to this Effect,</hi> viz.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>There are two ways for us to attain to <hi>the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God,</hi> (or a First Principle) by whom the
World was made; the one is Natural, the other,
Supernatural: That which I call Supernatural, I
what <hi>God has revealed in his Word, wherein he has
given us the clearest Idea of himself,</hi> as he by whom
all things were made: But because they who deny
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:59888:123"/>
the Being of a God, do generally make <hi>a scoff as
his Word,</hi> I will only insist upon that which is Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.
Nature informs us that there was a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Being, the Author and Preserver of all things:
<hi>This Truth I can see with my Eyes:</hi> when I either
behold the Earth, view the Heavens, or reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my self: When I see such things as are not
made but by a Superior Cause, I am obliged to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
and adore a Being which cannot be
made, and which made all things else. <hi>When I
consider my self,</hi> I am sure that I could not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a beginning; therefore it follows, That a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
like me, could not give me to be; and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
this puts me upon seeking out a <hi>First
Being;</hi> who having had no Beginning, must be the
Original of all other things. When my Reason
conducts me to this <hi>First Principle,</hi> I conclud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
that this Being cannot be limited, because
Limits suppose a Necessity of Production and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance:
And if unlimited, it must be a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
and Incomprehensible Being: And this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
all curious Enquirers from comprehending
what <hi>God</hi> is; <hi>For who can define that which is Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited,
or comprehend that which is Incomprehensible:</hi>
One must be blind indeed, to be ignorant of a First
Principle; but one must be infinite, like him, to
be able to speak exactly of him: For the most that
can be said by us, though it may perhaps content
the Curious, yet it can never satisfie the Rational
Soul.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This, Madam, was the <hi>Substance</hi> of what I spake
on that Occasion; which, as I said before, I leave
to your Censure. And to be yet more free with you,
I have <hi>those awful Thoughts of the Divine Being,</hi> that
I would never think of him, but with the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
Veneration; and therefore always choose to
think of him rather in the <hi>Abstract, than the Concrete;</hi>
for if I think him Good, my finit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> thought is ready
to terminate that Good in a <hi>conceived Subject;</hi> and

                  </p>
                  <p>And this brings me to (what I promisd) an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of my <hi>Practice</hi> in <hi>Dublin;</hi> which I will give
you in <hi>the Form of a Diary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I freely acknowledge, Madam, That the <hi>Sacred
Oracles of the Old and New Testaments,</hi> do sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
instruct us in the Performance of all those Duties
which God requires of us. But tho <hi>the Scriptures
of the Old and New Testaments are the very Word of
God, which holy Men of God spake and wrote as they
were moved by the Holy Ghost, and contain all things
necessary to salvation, and are the standing Sealed Rule
of Faith and Life;</hi> yet I believe that every one has
<hi>some particular Mode of his own,</hi> by which he steers
the Course of his Devotions; especially as to what
he performs in his Closet.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed to my Diary: And here I shall
first acquaint you how I spend <hi>Saturday.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Saturday <hi>is usually a Day of Hurry and Business,</hi>
with the generality of Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as the same winds
up the Week, so do People their Affairs: But for
my own part, I confess, I never affect multiplicity
of Business on that Day; but on the contrary, have
frequently shun'd it, tho' I have observ'd it has of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
fallen to my share upon these Days to have a great
deal; for last <hi>Saturday</hi> I was so taken up with <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justing
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:59888:124"/>
some Controversies that did arise concerning the
Affairs of my Auction,</hi> that I had hardly leisure to
take my Dinner; however they were terminated so
much the more to my satisfaction, by how much all
Parties were brought to acquiesce in my determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
By this you see, Madam, I am no <hi>Sabbata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian;</hi>
but for those that are, I am so far from having
any hard Thoughts of them, that I both pity and
respect them; for I can never believe 'tis <hi>an Error of
Wilfulness, but of Ignorance</hi> only in them: and
whereas I do understand divers of them, at least,
make <hi>a Conscience of keeping both Days,</hi> because they
would be sure to be right; I think I have just reason
to honour them for it, and cannot choose but think
much better of them, than those who totally deny
the <hi>Morality of the Sabbath day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I confess, Madam, I do not remember to have
read any thing material concerning the Controversie
about the <hi>said Days,</hi> and that I am as much at a loss
to know certainly when our <hi>Christian Sabbath begins,</hi>
when there is such a variation in the <hi>Site of Places
and Countries;</hi> and that now we experimentally
find, where 'tis <hi>Day in one place, 'tis Night in another.</hi>
And, Madam, as I know of no Person living, with
whom I can so well satisfie my Scruples, and inform
my Understanding than your self, who are so well
skill'd both in <hi>Polemical and Practical Divinity,</hi> so I
humbly request your Sentiments in this Case, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to make your Practice my own.</p>
                  <p>But, Madam, having told you how I spend
<hi>Saturday,</hi> I am next to inform you how I spend
the <hi>Sabbath:</hi> For in the <hi>Practice of Religion,</hi>
I look upon the Sanctifying of the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> to
be a principal part. Judge <hi>Hales</hi> recommends to
his Children a <hi>very strict Observation of the</hi> Lord's
Day; and tells 'em, That he had always found
that his Worldly Affairs thriv'd either more or less,
(the following Week) as he had kept the Sabbath.
And therefore on <hi>Sunday</hi> I usually took leave of my
Bed sooner than on other Days; and strive to dismiss
as much as I can, all Worldly Affairs out of my
Thoughts; tho I have found 'em, I acknowledge,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:59888:124"/>
                     <hi>(like the Flies that spoil the Apothecaries Ointment</hi>) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
most unseasonably thrusting themselves in.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Publick Worship of God,</hi> being the principal
Duty of this Day, I made it my Practice to bow my
Knees before my Maker in private, before I went
thither, and there beg his Blessing on the Publick
Ordinances; and previous thereto, have us'd to read
some Portion of the Holy Scriptures; being told
therein, that <hi>every thing is Sanctified by the Word of
God, and Prayer;</hi> which is so much the Advantage
of a Christian, that I always thought, never Prayer
rightly made, was made unheard, or heard ungrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
And I believe that Prayer is rightly made, which
is made to <hi>God in the Name of Christ,</hi> in Faith, and
offer'd up with Humility.</p>
                  <p>When I come to the House of God, (<hi>I mean the
place of his Worship, whether it be a</hi> Church, <hi>or a</hi>
Meeting-House) I always keep my self uncover'd
whilst I continue there: For as Holiness becomes his
House, so does a Behaviour mix'd with Reverence
and Godly Fear, in all that wait upon him. And
therefore during the Time of Prayer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>I either Kneel
or Stand up,</hi> (believing the humblest Posture to be
best, when I am invocating the Majesty of Heaven)
and fixing my Eyes upwards, I endeavour to apply
every part of God's Worship to my own Conscience,
<hi>and the present State of my own Soul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I love those Sermons best, that <hi>check my Conscience</hi>
for Sin, and cheer it with applying <hi>Gods Mercy;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
with the Law, and ending with the Gospel;
searching the Wound first, and pouring in the Oyl of
Consolation afterwards: And those I reckon the
worst Preachers, <hi>that sooth M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Men they are good Christians, when they
don't know what 'tis to be Born again.</p>
                  <p>Yet I don't love to be <hi>Pragmatical,</hi> in censuring
of Ministers; I endeavour, like the <hi>Industrious Bee</hi>
to suck Honey from the <hi>Flowers of Devotion;</hi> and
not like the Spider, to convert what was intended
for Nourishment, into Poyson. If any thing
drops from the Pulpit, which I think not so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
I cover it with the <hi>Mantl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:59888:125"/>
strive to remember that which is better: For as the

                     <hi>In the Singing of Psalms,</hi> I labour more to have

                  <p>In the <hi>Summer-time,</hi> I rose early in the Morning,
and walk'd abroad into the Fields, finding those <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casional
Meditations</hi> (that such a walk presented me
with Subjects for) proper to raise my Devotion to
a greater Fervour; <hi>the Beauty of the Creation,</hi> lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me by insensible steps to the Adoration of the
Great Creator; the Source and Fountain of all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies.
My walking along the <hi>Strand</hi> (a Mile
from <hi>Dublin</hi>) gave me <hi>a pleasant prospect of the Sea,</hi>
whose rowling Waves put me in mind of the Power
of Omnipotence, who commands both the Winds
and the Sea, saying, <hi>hitherto shalt thou come, but no
further.</hi>

                  <p>Leaving the <hi>Strand,</hi> I walk'd up a Hill into the
Fields, by the side of <hi>Ballibaugh-lane</hi> (which I
thought one of the best Prospects about <hi>Dublin</hi>) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Heaven, Earth, and Sea, in view</hi> at the same

swiftness of spiritual Bodies, which (though
far from Infinite, yet) have a motion quicker than
the Eye, and swifter than our Thoughts. <hi>Thus by
the things I have seen, I have been led into the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of unseen things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After about <hi>an hours Meditations</hi> in this Nature, my
usual way was to return to my Chamber, unless a
previous Appointment to meet any one about Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
hinder'd me. For though I had given the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of my Auctions</hi> to Mr. <hi>Wilde</hi> (who faithfully

so freed from Business my self, as not to have Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications

After some time <hi>being in my Chamber,</hi> and having

to that Enquiry, was, That I then had hopes of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from my Wife; distance and absence having so
endear'd her to me, that I was never well but when
I was writing to her, or hearing from her. But if
a Packet came, and there was no Letter for me, it
struck me into such a Melancholly (for fear <hi>Valeria</hi>
was ill) that I could hardly reconcile my self to a
good Humor all that day.</p>
                  <p>Madam, perhaps this will make you ask how long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I have been absent from her? Why Madam, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
a Month, but am fallen already to <hi>telling the

                  <p>Methinks Madam, I cou'd pass through an Army
of Beauties untoucht for one Glimpse of the <hi>Dear

you see I was a Man of Business; and that my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
was, to have a general Inspection over all my

                  <p>When I had spent about an hours time at <hi>my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
and had seen every one in their proper Post, I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
either went to visit a Friend, with whom sometimes
I walk'd into the Fields; or else went home to my

in Reading <hi>Montaigns Essays</hi> (for 'tis a Book I va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue

to my Auction,</hi> and crowd my self among the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that went thither to buy <hi>Pennyworths;</hi> and so
cou'd, <hi>unobserv'd,</hi> observe how things went. And
here, to do 'em Justice, I observ'd that several Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
bid like themselves, and as those that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the Worth and Value of the Books they bid
for. And others as much betray'd their Ignorance,
and took no other Measures for their bidding, but
from the bulk of the Book, if 'twas large (whatever
the worth on't was) they bid accordingly. And
yet, to do these Right, if they had but paid for
what they had so bought, I have no reason to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of 'em. <hi>Others</hi> there were, that in their bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
took their Measures from what they heard ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bid before 'em; <hi>and two of these happening to
meet together, wou'd strive so to out-bid each other,</hi>
that they wou'd sometimes raise but an indifferent
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:59888:130"/>
Book to a good Price: And these (<hi>provided still
they paid for 'em</hi>) were very honest Chapmen, and
help'd out those that went too often at an <hi>under
Rate.</hi> But whatsoever any bid, 'twas their own
<hi>Act and Deed;</hi> for I must do my self that Justice,
to assert that I had none of those unworthy ways
that have been used in some other Auctions. I had
not one Setter (to advance the Price, and draw on
unwary Bidders) in any of my five Sales. <hi>For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever

the <hi>future business of the day:</hi> Yet, Madam, as sound

them; but my Experience teaches me, that the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
Thoughts come fresh upon me the next day;
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:59888:130"/>
and how to digest and settle them, was the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
business; the main whereof, next after my

had receiv'd from <hi>England.</hi> My Custom always is,

I retain that of my Wife's to be the first perused,

                  <p>Thus, Madam, I have given you a brief, but <hi>true
Account of my general Method of Living:</hi> And by
such Steps as these (through the help of Divine
Grace) <hi>I strive to climb to Heaven;</hi> and sometimes
find my Soul upon the Wing thither, before I am
aware. There is, methinks, no Object in the World
that's more delightful, than when in a Star-light-night,
I survey the <hi>spangled Canopy of Heaven;</hi> for if
my Mind happen to be o'ercast with Melancholy,
when I look up and view the <hi>glittering Firmament,</hi>
and hope in a short time to soar above those starry
Regions, <hi>methinks I breath already the Air of a New
World;</hi> and all those black Vapors that o'erwhelm'd
my Soul, are fled in an instant: I then scorn this
Transitory World, and all its fading Pleasures, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the Vanity of the one, and the Emptiness of the
other.</hi>
                  </p>

                        </gap>us still my Soul moves upwards,</hi> as all the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Bodies do: But yet, as those Bodies are often
snatcht away to the <hi>West,</hi> by the rapid motion of the
<hi>Primum Mobile;</hi> so by those Epidemical Infirmities
incident to human Nature, I am often turn'd a clean
contrary course; <hi>though my Soul still persists in her
proper Motion.</hi> And I have oft occasion to be angry
with my self, when I consider, That whereas my
bountiful Creator intended my Body (tho'a lump
of Clay) shou'd <hi>be a Temple of his Holy Spirit, my
corrupt Affections shou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d turn it so often to a Bedlam,
and my Excesses to an Hospital.</hi> But as my Sin trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
me, so my trouble for Sin comforts me: And
I believe there is less danger in committing the Sin
I delight in, than in delighting in the Sin I have
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:59888:131"/>
committed. In a word, Madam, I have experienc'd
that the way to God is by my self; and the way to
my self is by my own Corruptions: If I baulk this
way, I err; <hi>If I travel by the Creatures, I wander:</hi>
For the Motion of the Heavens will give my Soul
no Rest, nor will the Vertue of Herbs increase mine;
the height of all Philosophy, both Natu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">

                     </gap> and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
being <hi>to know my self;</hi> and the end of this Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
is to know God, the knowledge of whom,
is the Perfection of Love; God being our chiefest
good, and the Enjoyment of him our highest Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.</p>
                  <p>And now, Madam, having given you <hi>a Specimen
of my way of Living in</hi> Dublin, both on the Sabbath;
and on the Week days. I come in the next place
to give you <hi>a Iournal of my Conversation,</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the Occurrences I met with here; by which
you may see what little occasion I gave for the

to her lewd Embraces.</p>
                  <p>It was in <hi>April</hi> when I came to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and near
Eleven a Clock at Night when I landed; so that it
was with some difficulty that I got a Lodging for
that Night; for which I own my self beholding to
Mrs. <hi>Lisle</hi> (the Widow) at the <hi>Dukes-head Tavern
in Castle-street,</hi> the first Place I drank at in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
I have always <hi>the Vnhappiness of being sick at Sea,</hi>
which, though it be very irksome to bear, yet I find
this good in't, that it <hi>endears the sence of God's Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to me when I come to Land,</hi> and makes me the
more thankful for my Preservation. Which having
perform'd as well as the Fatigue I had been under
would permit, I betook my self to my Chamber, and
<hi>slept that Night without Rocking;</hi> though in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both my Bed and Chamber seem'd to me to have
the same motion that my <hi>fluctuating Cabin</hi> had, the
day before. Being got up the next Morning,
I again renew'd my Thanks to God, for my
Preservation at Sea, and safe arrival at <hi>Dublin.</hi>
And now being <hi>drest as it were in Print,</hi> (for my busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
now was to see and be seen) I marched very <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically</hi>
out of my Lodgings with two (<hi>I can't say a

t'other; and 'tis not long since I had done sowing my
<hi>wild Oats;</hi> and now I am earnestly hunting after
<hi>Gaup-seed.</hi> You wou'd smile, Madam, if you had
the <hi>Picture of your quondam friend at the black Raven,</hi>
like an over-grown <hi>Oaf</hi> newly come to Town, sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and gazing at all the Signs, and every thing

ever and anon, <hi>What call ye this Street?
Who dwells in you great House? Whose fine Coach is that?</hi>
For thus I rambled through every Street, Alley, and
corner of this spacious Town, as you'll find at large
in my <hi>Summer Travels,</hi> where 200 Persons will see
their Pictures, that at present little expect it; but
I leave 'em here, to tell ye the first visit I made in
<hi>Dublin,</hi> was to <hi>Nat. Gun.</hi> a Bookseller in <hi>

                        </gap>ssex-street,</hi>
to whom I was directed by my Friend, Mr. <hi>Richard
Wild,</hi> (whom I had left behind me in <hi>London</hi>)<q>This
<hi>Son of a Gun</hi> gave me a hearty Welcome; and, to
do him Justice, <hi>he's as honest a Man as the World
affords;</hi> and is so esteemed by all that know him.
He is a firm adherer to the established Government,
and a declared Enemy to <hi>Popery and Slavery:</hi> So
far from dissembling, that he knows not how to
go about it; and will speak his Mind, how much
soever it may be to his Prejudice. He understands
<hi>Stenography as well as Bookbinding;</hi> and he himself
is a sort of a Short-hand Character; for he is a
<hi>little Fellow,</hi> but one that contains a great deal.
And as he is a most incomparable Writer of Short-hand,
so he speaks it as well as writes it: and to
compleat his Character, He is a <hi>constant Shop-keeper,</hi>
without earnest Business calls him to the <hi>Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condrah.</hi>
This <hi>Gun</hi> was a constant and generous
bidder at my <hi>Auctions,</hi> where he bought a great
quantity of Books, which he as honestly paid
for</q>

                  <p>At Mr. <hi>Gun's Shop,</hi> I met with Mr. <hi>

                        </gap>,</hi> another
Bookseller, but his principal Business is Binding;
whom I afterwards employed considerably: <q>He is
a very honest Man, but has met with Misfortunes
in the World, by thinking some others as honest
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:59888:132"/>
as himself, who did not prove so.</q> I ask'd
Mr. <hi>Bently,</hi> whether there was not some Eminence
in the City, from whence I might survey it? He
told me there was; and that from the top of the
<hi>Tholsel,</hi> the whole City might be seen; so we went
to the <hi>Tholsel,</hi> where we ascended about <hi>half a score
Stairs</hi> from the Street, which brought us into a <hi>spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

(as they term it here) with free Stone, with
open Banisters on each side towards the Street; its
figure is rather <hi>an oblong than a square:</hi> This is the
Place they call the <hi>Change,</hi> where the Merchants
meet every day, as on the <hi>Royal Exchange</hi> in <hi>London.</hi>
In a corner, at the <hi>South-East</hi> part, is a <hi>Court of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature,
where they keep their publick Sessions for the
City.</hi> Having view'd the lower part, we went up a
large pair of Stairs into a publick Room, which had
a <hi>large Balconey</hi> looking into <hi>Skinner Row;</hi> and from
this Balcony I spoke with my Friend Mr. <hi>Geo. Larkin,</hi>
who was then at Mr. Ray<hi>'s Printing-house</hi> over-against
it. He no sooner saw me, but came over to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate
my safe arrival, expressing himself very joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to see me; and I was as glad as he, we having
a long time had a kindness for each other, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd
by Letter, even when I was in <hi>America.</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
said so much of him, you'll not wonder, Madam,
if I send ye an <hi>Epitomy of his Character,</hi> (intending
to do it more largely in my <hi>Summer Ramble</hi>)<q>He
is of a midling Stature, somewhat gross, of a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine
Complexion, and a hail Constitution both
of Body and Mind; and (which I admire where
ever I find it) he is of an <hi>even Temper,</hi> not elated
when Fortune Smiles, nor cast down with her
Frowns; and though his Stars have not been very
propitious to him, with respect to his outward
Circumstances, (he having had great Losses) yet
he has born all with <hi>such a presence of Mind,</hi> as
shew'd his Losses to be the effect of his Misfortunes,
and not his Faults. His Conversation is extreamly
diverting, and what he says is always to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
<hi>He is a particular Votary of the Muses;</hi> and
I have seen some of his <hi>Poems</hi> that can't be equall'd:
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:59888:132"/>
But there is one thing more peculiar to him, which
is, That whatever he does, <hi>is upon the Account
Civil.</hi>

justly claim the Precedence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>'Twas at the <hi>Tholsel</hi> I met Mr. <hi>Dell,</hi> a Person
whose Understanding and generous Temper, set him
above the <hi>common Rate of Men, and shew him to be

these <hi>Qualifications,</hi> but much more as he was an

and Madam, you can't blame me for this, as she
treats me with that Tenderness, that I think her <hi>my

much. Mr. <hi>Dell</hi> shew'd me a most particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect

wou'd have me go into <hi>Dick's Coffee-house, where I
had been advis'd by</hi> Mr. Wild, <hi>to keep my Auctions:</hi> I
readily agreed to his Motion, and went up, saw it,
and liked it, as proper for my Purpose; <hi>Dick</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me all the Civility I could desire: And I must
say this of <hi>Dick,</hi> (notwithstanding our after Quar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rel)
<q>That he is a Witty and Ingenious Man, <hi>makes
the best Coffee in</hi> Dublin; and is very Civil and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:59888:133"/>
to all his Customers; of an open and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Nature; has a peculiar Knack at Bantering,
and will <hi>make Rhymes to any thing:</hi> He's of a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
facetious Temper, and generally speaking fair
in his Dealing: And had not <hi>Patrick</hi> assaulted him
with the Temptation of a <hi>double Price,</hi> he and I
shou'd never have quarrel'd; and yet for all that,
I must do him the Justice to say, he carry'd it ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy

Apartments,</hi> but I wave 'em here, designing to speak
of 'em in my <hi>Summer Ramble;</hi> however, I'll here
attempt <hi>his Lordships Character,</hi> and hope my honest
Intention herein will something attone for my great
Defects; and the rather still, as his Lordships Merits
are above a <hi>Dryden</hi>'s <hi>or a Cowley's Pen.</hi> I own 'tis
a bold Undertaking, to offer at the <hi>Character of one
of the greatest Men</hi> which our Age has produc'd,
especially for one who has not the Honour of being
<hi>personally known to him;</hi> however, though I can't
perform this Great Task as it ought to be, yet I'll
endeavour at <hi>something so like him,</hi> that any one at

<hi>Galway,</hi> one of the present Lords Justices for the
Kingdom of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Then to proceed (tho' with
a trembling Hand) to his <hi>Lordships Character.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first thing then which is remarkable in him,

                     <q>He is a Person of <hi>strict Morals, and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

he now enjoys, by his great Humility and
Personal Merits. <hi>The Noble Blood that has fill'd his
Veins, has not swell'd his Heart:</hi> He is as humble as
he is great; he seems set by Heaven on such a
conspicuous Place, (as is that of being Lord Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of <hi>Ireland</hi>) on purpose to guide the People
into the Paths of Love and Obedience to their
God and King. In a word, he uses such an oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

in Greatness, is the power it gives to oblige.</hi>
                     </q>
I wou'd go on with his Lordship's Character, but
(as I said before) I find my self unable for this

(for his Lordship's Character leads me to it)
to give some short Account of the <hi>present State of

'em; and in the like manner they return back to
the <hi>Castle,</hi> where the several Courses at dinner are
usher'd in by <hi>Kettle-drums and Trumpets.</hi> I forgot to
tell you (Madam) that in these <hi>Cavalcades</hi> the Coach

                  <p>
                     <hi>Having given ye this short Account of the Chief
Governors,</hi> I shall next proceed to mention some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the <hi>Estate of the Church,</hi> which in all its
Canons are not the same with that of <hi>England;</hi>
not that they differ from it in any points of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
but only in some Circumstances of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
which by a <hi>Convocation</hi> which has been some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
held here, may be alter'd as the present Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies
require: It consists of two Houses, <hi>viz.</hi> The
Upper in which the Bishops, and the lower where
the Inferior Clergy sit; but they have not thought
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:59888:134"/>
it needful to call one since his present Majesty's Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
to the Crown. The most Reverend the
Arch-bishops are four, <hi>viz.</hi> Dr. <hi>Michael Boyl,</hi> Lord
Arch-bishop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> and Primate of all <hi>Ireland.</hi>
Dr. <hi>Narcissus Marsh,</hi> Lord Arch-bishop of <hi>Dublin,</hi>
Primate of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Dr. <hi>William Palliser,</hi> Lord Arch-bishop
of <hi>Cashell;</hi> and Dr. <hi>Iohn Vesey,</hi> Lord Arch-bishop
of <hi>Tuam.</hi> And the Suffragants are eighteen in
Number, of this Number Three are of his Majesty's
Privy-Council, <hi>viz.</hi> The Bishops of <hi>Meath, Kildare,</hi>
and <hi>Clogher,</hi> as also the two Primates. To give you
a short Character of them, take this, what has been
told me by some Judicious Persons, of as well Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters
as others, <hi>That they are Men of such Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Moderation, and Piety, that this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a better Class of Bishops to govern it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Dissenters in</hi> Ireland <hi>are a very considerable
People,</hi> as well for their Number as Wealth; and all
unanimous in an hearty Zeal for our present happy
Government. (And indeed, since my coming hither,
I have not heard of any one <hi>Iacobite in the whole
Kingdom.</hi>) They have several <hi>Meeting-houses,</hi> large
and conveniently order'd within; and these are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
with Sober and Pious Teachers; among whom I
think the <hi>Reverend Mr.</hi> Boyse <hi>may justly be named
as the Chief; one, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> by continual and hard Study
every Day, fits himself with new Acquisitions towards
the happy discharging of his Pastoral Care; which he
expresses with so much Meekness, and force of Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
as make him at once mightily belov'd and follow'd.</hi>
And one thing this Kingdom is extreamly happy in,
That both Perswasions do so well agree, towards
promoting the common good, as more cannot well
be desir'd; a great Advancer of which Union, is
<hi>Mr.</hi> Weld, <hi>a Person of Sobriety, Learning, and solid
Iudgment, and much admir'd and follow'd for his
Preaching.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Quakers</hi> are here in great Numbers also, as
one might easily perceive that would have consider'd
the mighty Throngs of them which crowded about
their <hi>Great speaker and Champion, William Pen,</hi> when
he came hither to hold forth. I cannot hear of any
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:59888:135"/>
Learned Men among them, though some of them
are very Wealthy, and but few of them poor; they
can make use of the <hi>Carnal Sword,</hi> as well as those
who pretend more to it; as you will believe by this
Story of one among them, whose Name I forget;
who, in the late War, when the <hi>Rapparees</hi> came
towards <hi>Edenderry,</hi> near the Bogg of <hi>Allen,</hi> in the
Kings County, he, among other of the <hi>Militia,</hi>
went forth to engage them, and put them all to the
run, except those who were kill'd in the Action;
among them lay one whom the <hi>Quaker thought he
had kill'd,</hi> and rifled his Pockets; but some Months
after, when a great number of them burnt Colonel
<hi>Purefoy's</hi> House, about three Miles from <hi>Edenderry,</hi>
these brisk Sparks took, the Alarm, and making as
considerable a body as they could, march'd to <hi>Pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foys-place,</hi>
where they found many of the <hi>Irish,</hi> who
had made themselves drunk with the Colonels strong
Beer, fast asleep in the Ditches; the <hi>Quaker,</hi> who
never was backward in such Attempts, finds the
same Fellow whom he thought he had formerly
kill'd, half tipsie, and in his Arms; he call'd him by
his Name, saying, <hi>Verily I thought I had of late slain
thee?</hi> but now find my Mistake; wherefore I
purpose to make sure work, and hinder thee from
Rising any more; and so immediately knockt him
down with a <hi>Poll-Ax</hi> which he used always instead
of a Sword; and then cut off his Head. Poor <hi>Teig</hi>
never offer'd at any Resistance, nor endeavour'd
to save himself by flight, but stood to die like a
Fool.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Our Red Letter'd Gentlemen</hi> were never under such
Circumstances here, as now; for all their <hi>Bishops
and Regular Clergy</hi> are banish'd by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which makes it Death to find any of them
return'd again. So that now they are wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
on the Seculars, and every Parish is allow'd
his Priest; but when he dies, there being <hi>none to
Ordain a new one,</hi> it must remain without; and this
will be the <hi>State of the whole Kingdom</hi> in a little
time, when the present set of Priests shall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct.
They have also another Law, That no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:59888:135"/>
shall keep a School, nor any one Native of a
Foreign Education be admitted to dwell in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
so that by these Acts I think it will appear
plain enough, that the <hi>Romish Religion is on its last
Legs in Ireland;</hi> and the present Romanists who
survive their Priests, must conform to the Protestant
Religion, or live and die without the Exercise of
their own. I do not pretend to make my Judgment
upon these Methods; but I think the next Age will
have few People inclinable to any more Rebellions
against <hi>England;</hi> and some of the Papist Lords have
put their Children to be Educated in the Protestant
Faith; and several Gentlemen have lately abjur'd
the Romish.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>These Ghostly Fathers</hi> were to render themselves
on the first day of <hi>May</hi> for Transportation at <hi>Dublin,
Cork,</hi> &amp;c. where their Names were enter'd with
the Magistrate of the Town; ye may guess at the
Lamentations which were made at parting with such
<hi>precious Iewels;</hi> and Masses were said, and Money
begg'd for them, besides what the People volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
gave without asking. One <hi>old Fryar, called Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Kereen,</hi> who had been a famous Exorcist, and
excellent good at helping <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>attle that were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look'd
or bewitch'd, (for some of the vulgar are so
superstitious to believe this) made sale of good
store of <hi>Holy Water,</hi> which <hi>had helpt to cast out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils;
and of several other consecrated Trinckams,</hi> by
which it was said he acquir'd such a Summ of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
as might suffice for his support all his days;
and such were the Tricks play'd by many of them
on their going into Exile, as leaving <hi>Holy Tokens,</hi>
and taking Catalogues of their Acquaintances Names,
to <hi>pray for them all the Days of their Life.</hi> Now these
Kindnesses deserv'd some returns, which they never
fail'd of; though whether they are as good as their
words in remembring them, I leave to their own
Breasts. Before I leave this account of the <hi>State of
Religion in Ireland,</hi> I shall acquaint you with the
manner of <hi>exorcising their Demoniacks</hi> (though for
my part I think the Devil is in the presumptuous
Priest, rather than the melancholy Person) and
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:59888:136"/>
you may judge how sit such Persons are for honest
Society.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The Exorcist, before he goes to work, ought
by way of a preparative, to confess his Sins, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Eucharist; then he begins the Operation
with some short Prayers, and tyes the ends of the
<hi>violet coloured Stole</hi> that he wears, about the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniacks
Neck; who, if outragious, must be tyed
Hand and Foot; then crossing him, and the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standers,
they go to Prayer, and read the 53 <hi>Psalm,</hi>
and after a Prayer or two more, he thus speaks to the
Devil: <hi>I command thee thou unclean Spirit, whoever
thou art, and all thy Companions, that do possess this
Servant of God, That by the Mystery of the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Passion, Resurrection, and Ascension of our Lord
I. C. by the sending the Holy Ghost, and the coming
of our Lord to Iudgment,</hi> thou tell me thy Name,
and the day and hour of thy <hi>Exit,</hi> with some sign;
and that thou obey me the unworth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Minister of
God in all things; and that thou offend not this
Creature of God, or any of the By-standers in their
Persons or Goods. Then he crosses himself, and
the Demoniack on the Fore-head, Mouth, and
Breast, and reads some Gospel, as that of the First
of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> the 16 <hi>th</hi> of <hi>Mark,</hi> or the 10 <hi>th of
Luke;</hi> then falling to Prayer, he begs to be enabled
to cast forth this cruel Devil; then lapping the
Stole about the possessed Parties Neck, and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
him with the Sign of the Gross, he lays his
Right Hand on the Patients Head, and cries out,
<hi>Behold the Cross of the Lord!</hi> (which he shews him)
Fly from it ye adverse Parties: <hi>The Lyon of the
Tribe of Iudah,</hi> the Root of <hi>David</hi> hath overcome:
Then to Prayer again he goes, and begins a new
Exorcism, saying, I exorcise thee, most foul Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
every Incursion of the Adversary, every Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasm,
and every Legion, in the Name of our Lord
J. C. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> to fly from, and be eradicated <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> out of
this Image of God: He commands thee, who bid
thee be plunged from the highest Heavens, into
the lower parts of the Earth: He whom the Sea,
Winds and Tempests obey, commands thee. <hi>Then
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:59888:136"/>
when this does not serve turn, he falls to scold the
Devil after this manner,</hi> Hear therefore, and fear,
thou Satan, Enemy of the Faith, and all Mankind;
thou Introducer of Death, and Destroyer of Life,
Decliner of Justice, Root of all Evils, Fomenter
of Vices, Seducer of Men, Betrayer of Nations,
Promoter of Envy, Source of Avarice, Cause of
Discord, and Exciter of Sorrow, Why dost thou
stay? Why dost thou resist, when thou knowest
the Lord Christ can destroy all thy Power? Fear
him who was sacrificed in <hi>Isaac,</hi> sold in <hi>Ioseph,</hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ain in the Lamb, crucified in Man, and at last tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed
over Hell. Then he <hi>makes the following Cross
in the Forehead of the Possessed;</hi> Be gone you in the
Name of the Father, <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> and of the Son, <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> and
of the Holy Ghost, <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> Give way to the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

                        </gap> sign of the Cross of our Lord J. C.
Then they go to Prayers; and after them another
Exorcism is used like the former, wherein he calls
the Devil many hard Names, and tells him of all
the Rogueries he has ever committed, and bids
him be gone for shame, since all his Tricks are
discovered.</q>

my Design in this Letter (as I said at first)
<hi>being rather to tell ye how I liv'd in</hi> Ireland, <hi>than to
tell ye what I saw or observ'd there.</hi> And in the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of my <hi>Conversation,</hi> with respect to the <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences</hi>
I met with there (for that's the Subject I
am still upon) I am next to tell ye, that having
seen the Castle, and other Rarities, I was the next
Sunday for going to <hi>Church</hi> (the Place where the
<hi>Lords Iustices</hi> usually go) and accordingly thither
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:59888:137"/>
I went in Company with Mr. <hi>Larkin.</hi> After we had
seen the <hi>State in which the Government rides to Church</hi>
(which indeed is very splendid, as I hinted before)
we crowded into the Church, where I endeavoured
to compose my self in the most serious manner I
could, to attend the Service of God performed there.
I do not pretend to retain <hi>whole Sermons</hi> by heart,
but can have a satisfied Conscience in keeping only
in my Memory, a remarkable passage or two that
suits best to the then Edification of my Soul; much
less then, Madam, shall I offer to describe this place
of Divine Worship, or Descant upon the Auditory:
but as 'tis most natural for Mankind, upon the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
of fresh Objects,</hi> to view them at least in a
transient manner; I found it so with my self here,
notwithstanding the Injunctions of God, and my
own Conscience, to keep close to my Devotion;
but pardon me Madam, if I am necessitated to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
I did not behold <hi>one tolerable Face</hi> among all
those that are distinguish'd by the Name of the <hi>Fair
Sex:</hi> So that here I can truly say, <hi>They were no
Temptation to me;</hi> and that I had no occasion <hi>to
make a Covenant with my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>yes:</hi> But for my self,
I could have been heartily content they had had a
certain place of Worship from the Men, assigned
them in the Assembly, as the <hi>Eastern</hi> Churches have,
but for what reason I know not. But this Liberty
(Madam) that I took to gaze, and make Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
was only while they were <hi>singing an Anthem,</hi>
with Vocal and Instrumental Musick, there being
<hi>two pair of Organs</hi> in <hi>Christ-Church;</hi> of which one is
a very noble one. But when the Minister ascended
the Pulpit, I heard him with <hi>great Attention and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light:</hi>
He was a Dignitary of the Church, but his
Name has slipt my Memory. Retiring home from
hence with what convenient speed the Infirmity of
my Body would permit me, I din'd in my Lodging
with my Landlord <hi>H</hi>—a Jolley Man in his natural
Temper, but not very serious in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
I made my Repast as short as I could, (as is
usual with me upon such days) and withdrew into
my Chamber, where I spent the remainder of the
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:59888:137"/>
day in such Acts of Devotion and Meditation as
were usual with me; but I had some more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Impressions upon my Spirits concer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to the Glory of the Divine Name, that some touches
in the Sermon I had heard that day concerning
<hi>Thankfulness for Mercies receiv'd,</hi> were very helpful
to me in the course of this Evenings Devotion.</p>
                  <p>The next Week I went to see <hi>Patrick Campbel,</hi> to
whom (by his Order) I had sent several of Mr. <hi>Turner</hi>'s
<hi>History.</hi> He treated me well enough the first time I
saw him, <hi>giving me my Mornings Draught, and tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me I was welcome to</hi> Dublin: But I said nothing
then of the <hi>Books I sent him,</hi> nor he to me; which
I thought somewhat strange. <hi>The second time</hi>
I went to him, which was the Week following;
after the usual <hi>How-dee's</hi> were over, I expected he
shou'd have took some notice to me of the Books;
which he not doing, I took notice of 'em to him;
and then it was I perceiv'd he had a <hi>Natural Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to Honesty;</hi> for he began to shuffle at the very
mention of 'em. However, resolving to be easie
with him, I took my leave of him for that time.
<hi>The third time I saw him,</hi> he shuffl'd about my Books
at that rate, that a Stranger in his Shop (to whom
I offer'd to refer my Cause) resented it: <hi>And from
that time forward</hi> (only for demanding my own,
and telling him how unfairly he dealt by me) he
became my Enemy. <hi>This, Madam, being the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
with whom I had the preceeding Scuffle;</hi> if by this
you don't sufficiently see his Character, give me
leave to give it you? which I will do impartially,
and without any respect to the <hi>Controversie</hi> I had
with him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>He is, of Stature, rather Tall than otherwise;
<hi>his Hair reddish,</hi> his Speech very broad, like his
Country; <hi>no Schollar, but of good Natural Parts;</hi>
very covetous, and extreamly proud: He had a
very mean beginning (for which no man ought to
blame him, for he cou'd n't help it himself, and
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:59888:138"/>
consequently 'twas none of his fault) <hi>but his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable
Pride makes it necessary that he be often
put in mind on't.</hi> I have heard some Persons say,
that had dealings with him, That they had rather
speak to the Lord Mayor about Business, than <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick
Campbel;</hi> and that he wou'd not look for so
much respect. He cares not to part with Money,
and where he can s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>uffle he will: He is of <hi>Vespasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s
Mind, and thinks no Gain is unsavoury. What
good parts he has, he uses ill, employing 'em for
the most part to circumvent his Neighbour. (Of
which his <hi>taking my Room over my Head</hi> is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable
Instance.) He understands the Doctrin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of Equivocation as well as a Jesuit; and their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesties
are much alike, only the Jesuits are the
fairer Dealers. He pretends extreamly to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and has got many a Penny by the Bargain:
He'll commonly say Grace over a <hi>Choppin of Ale,</hi>
and at the same time be contriving<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach

                  <p>Some time after this, seeing the <hi>Squire of Alsatia

give her her own rate for her Oranges; for you
know, Madam, 'tis below a Gentlemen (and as
such I passd in the Crowd) to stand hagling like a

to be a place very contrary to its owners; for
they on their out-sides make the best show: But
this is <hi>very ordinary in its outward appearance,</hi> but
looks much better on the inside, with its <hi>Stage, Pit,

<hi>Smock-Alley;</hi> which I think is no unfit Name for a
Place where such great Opportunities are given for
making of <hi>lewd Bargains:</hi> Hither I came drest (tho'
I say't) tollerably well; tho' not so much to be
seen, as to see the Follies of the Age; for however
the <hi>Theatre</hi> be applauded by a Modern Gentleman,
for the Representation of those things which so
mightily promote <hi>Vertue, Religion, and Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Government;</hi> for my part, I thought Vice, which
fundamentally destroys all those things, is here, as
well as in other <hi>Theatres, so charmingly discover'd,</hi>
as to make Men rather love than abhor it; like the
Judge, who, on the Bench, discovering, the Arts of
some <hi>Cow-stealers,</hi> to disguise their Beasts by <hi>alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Figure of their Horns,</hi> taught a poor fellow
the Trick, who putting it in Practice, was brought
to the Gallows; However, to give the <hi>Devil his
due,</hi> there are some Actors here, particularly Mr. <hi>Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Husbands,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wilks,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hescot,</hi> Mr. <hi>Norris,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Buckly,</hi> Mr. <hi>Longmore,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Smith,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Schooling,</hi>
no way inferior to those in <hi>London;</hi> nor are the
<hi>Spectators,</hi> by what I saw, one degree less <hi>in Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and Foppery,</hi> than those in another Place.</p>
                  <p>For the Play, Madam, I need say nothing, 'tis
so well known; 'twas pretty to see the <hi>Squire
choused</hi> out of so fair an Estate with so little <hi>ready
Rino:</hi> Yet the Diversion was not so great, but that
the Crowd made me more uneasie; a thing I ever
abominated, and for the most part made it my Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
to shun all my days; in a word, no Church I
was in while at <hi>Dublin,</hi> cou'd I discern to be half so
crowded as this Place. I cannot tell indeed how it
would have been, had they play'd on <hi>Sunday,</hi> as
they do in Popish Countries, and particularly at
<hi>Rome;</hi> where a Stranger once observed, all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
suddenly ran out of the Play-house into the
Church, as fast as they could, which made him at
first think it was a most Religious Place; but when
he came to hear the Fryar Preach, his Words, Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and other Gestures were so Comical, that his
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:59888:139"/>
Wonder ceased; for he thought all the Actors and
Players in <hi>Christendom</hi> were a Fool to him.</p>
                  <p>After spending three or four hours in the <hi>Play-house,</hi>
to see a few Men and Women make Fools of
themselves, I returned home to my Chamber, and
cou'd scarce be reconcil'd to my self, to think how
foolishly I had wasted that time which might have
been spent to better purpose.</p>
                  <p>Madam, I shou'd next acquaint you with a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
Storm</hi> which happened in <hi>Dublin</hi> about the
latter end of <hi>Iuly;</hi> it might indeed be more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
call'd a <hi>Hurricane</hi> than a Storm: It strangely sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
me, though its fury continued not above six
hours; there was hardly a House in the City, where
it had not left some visible Marks of its Rage (es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
in <hi>Christ-Church-lane:</hi>) So that it was mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

safe being in the Fields, than in the City at that
time; the oldest Men alive cou'd never remember
any thing so terrible as this Storm. But to give an
account of the Mischief it did, wou'd be too great a
Digression, I shall therefore reserve it for my <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Ramble;</hi> as I shall also a <hi>Comical Entertainment
made at</hi> Kells <hi>in the County of</hi> Meath, <hi>by one Captain</hi>
Bryan O Brogan, <hi>Son to</hi> Philip O Brogan, <hi>Prince of</hi>
Cavan.</p>
                  <p>Soon after this <hi>Great Storm,</hi> the <hi>Duke of Ormond</hi>
landed at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and from thence went to his
House at <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> where (in my <hi>Summer Ramble</hi>)
I saw his Grace, and had a sight of the Castle, and
other Rarities, by the Interest of Dr. <hi>Wood,</hi> whose
great Civilities I acknowledge in the following Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
About this time the <hi>Dublin Players,</hi> with all
their Appurtinances, stroled down to <hi>Kilkenny;</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which 'twas reported in <hi>Dublin,</hi> that one <hi>Wilks,</hi>
one of the best Actors, had <hi>play'd his last part,</hi> being
kill'd in a Duel; this Report was
so far believ'd, that an Ingenious
Person writ an <hi>Elegy</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Which Elegy I'll insert in my Summer Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> upon him,
which was Printed, and publickly
Sold. This News of his Death
was talk'd with such Assurance,
that though Mr. <hi>Wilks</hi> soon after came to <hi>Dublin</hi>
                     <pb n="342" facs="tcp:59888:140"/>
and shew'd himself alive, they wou'd hardly believe
him. The ground of this Report (as I was told)
arose from this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>That a Country-man seeing a Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
acted in</hi> Kilkenny, <hi>wherein Mr.</hi> Wilks <hi>acted the
part of one that was to be kill'd, thought it was real,
and so reported it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I might next mention the sudden Deaths of the
<hi>Dublin Sheriffs;</hi> the Tragical Story of a Person that
was kill'd by a fall from his Horse; and the <hi>dismal
Accident</hi> of a Child's firing a Garret (<hi>with himself in
it</hi>) with Gunpowder; but shou'd I relate <hi>half the
Occurrences</hi> I met in <hi>Dublin,</hi> I shou'd <hi>swell this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
beyond measure,</hi> so I reserve 'em all for my <hi>Summer
Ramble;</hi> and shall next proceed (that I may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the account of my <hi>Conversation</hi> the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat)
to give a particular Account of the <hi>Vis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ts I
made in Dublin;</hi> for, Madam, as 'tis an Observation,
<hi>That a Man may be known by his Company,</hi> so I think
'tis not incongruous to believe that <hi>an Idea of his
Conversation</hi> may be taken from the Persons to whom,
and the Occasions on which he makes his <hi>Visits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here (Madam) I must first acquaint ye, that
soon after my coming to <hi>Dublin,</hi> Mr. <hi>Norman</hi> the
Bookseller sent one Mr. <hi>Rogerson,</hi> to invite me to his
House; when I came thither, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ound his Business
was to propose the buying of the Venture I had
brought over; in which, though we agreed not, he
treated me very kindly, shewing me all his House,
and therein <hi>his Picture,</hi> done so much to the Life,
that even <hi>Ze<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>From his House he had me to his Garden,</hi> which
though not very large, is to be much admir'd for
the <hi>curiousness of the Knots, and variety of choice
Flowers that are in it;</hi> he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eing an excellent Florist,
and well acquainted with all the <hi>variegated Tapistry</hi>
of Nature, in the several Seasons of the year. Mr. <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
has this peculiar to himself, that whatever he
has in his <hi>Garden,</hi> is the most excellent of its kind:
He has a Room adjoyning to this Earthly Paradise,
to shelter his <hi>more tender Plants and Flowers</hi> from the
Insults of Winter-storms. From hence he carried
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:59888:140"/>
me to a large Ware-house, where he had a <hi>large
Auction,</hi> preparing, as he said, for Sale; though I
heard nothing more of it while I staid in <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Madam, shou'd I give ye this <hi>Gentleman</hi>'s <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,</hi>
I must say, <q>He's <hi>a little squat Man,</hi> that
loves to live well, and has a Spouse who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
preparing good things as well as the <hi>best La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in Ireland;</hi> he has a <hi>hole too much in his Nose,</hi>
which I have heard was occasion'd by a <hi>Brass Pin</hi> in
his Nurses Wastcoat; which when he was <hi>nuzling
for the Diddy,</hi> hapned to run in it; and for want of
a skilful hand to dress it, the <hi>hole remains to this
day,</hi> and yet without <hi>disfiguring his Face.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before I proceed to the next Visit, give me leave,
Madam, being fall'n (<hi>a second time</hi>) among my
Brethren, to spend a few Lines about 'em, among
the many I trouble you with concerning other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
they are not a <hi>Corporation of themselves,</hi> but
mixt with <hi>Cutlers, and Painter-stainers;</hi> and their
present Master is Mr. <hi>Norman,</hi> whose <hi>Character</hi> I
here send ye; with this Addition, that he never
opposed my <hi>Auction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor must I (Madam) forget the extraordinary
Civility of the King's Printer, Mr. <hi>Andrew Crook,</hi>
                     <q>Who is a worthy and generous Gentleman, whose
Word and Meaning never shake hands and part, but
always go together: He is one that is as far from
doing other Men an Injury, as he is from desiring
to be injur'd; and though his Circumstances are
not so great, yet his Soul is as large, as if he were
a Prince, and scorns as much to do an unworthy
Action. He is a great Lover of Printing, and has
a great Respect for all that are related to that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Mystery.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having paid my Respects to the King's <hi>Printer,</hi>
I went next to Mr. <hi>Thornton,</hi> the King's <hi>Stationer,</hi>
of whom I shall say in short, <q>He's a very obliging
Person, has sence enough for a Privy-Counsellor,
and good Nature enough for a <hi>Primitive Christian.</hi>
He treated me when I came to <hi>Dublin,</hi> with a
Bottle of Excellent Claret; and if I live to publish
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:59888:141"/>
my <hi>Summer Ramble, Patrick Campbel</hi> shall know
(though he was afraid to meet him at the <hi>Keys in
High-street</hi>) there is not a better Neighbour, nor
an honester Man in <hi>Dublin.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As I pass'd from the <hi>King's Stationer,</hi> I met with
an honest Gentleman, with whom I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
acquainted in <hi>London;</hi> 'twas my worthy
Friend Dr. <hi>Smith,</hi> of <hi>College-green</hi> near <hi>Dublin;</hi> his
Character is above my Pen, yet I may venture to
say, <hi>He is a Man of extraordinary Sense; and the
only Physitian I durst commit the Care of my Health to,
in the whole Country: He invited me to his House,
and when I came, gave me a hearty Welcome; and for
his Treat, though 'twas very Genteel, yet nothing seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so agreeable to me, as the Doctors Company,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I went next to <hi>Brides-street,</hi> to pay my Respects
to Mr. <hi>Wallis</hi> (a Member of Parliament) and <hi>his
Lady,</hi> with whom I had the Honour to be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(at <hi>Tunbridge</hi>) some years ago; I shall ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the generous Reception I met with here,
neither can I forget to characterize his extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Kinswoman, <q>
                        <hi>whose Wit and Beauty set her above
the rest of the fair Sex, as having nothing in her but
what bears witness to the Perfection of her Mind and
Body</hi>
                     </q>
                     <q>
                        <l>Saint like she looks, a Syren if she sing;</l>
                        <l>Her Eyes are Stars, her Mind is ev'ry thing.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I wou'd say something too of that ingenious Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
who is <hi>Tutor</hi> to Mr. <hi>Wallis</hi>'s <hi>Children;</hi> for I
found (in some Discourses I had with him) <q>That
his <hi>Learning and Knowledge had out-strip'd his years;</hi>
but he's too modest to bear the Character he justly
merits; and to speak of him by halfs, is what I
can't approve of; so I'll wave his Character with
only saying, <hi>The Conversation I found here, was
the most agreeable of any I met in</hi> Dublin.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Durst I here attempt Mr. <hi>Wallis</hi>'s <hi>Character,</hi> I
might say of him (as was said of the Lord <hi>Russel</hi>)
That he's one of the <hi>best of Sons, the best of Fathers,
the best of Husbands, the best of Masters, the best
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:59888:141"/>
of Friends, and the best of Christians;</hi> and his Lady is
no ways inferior to him for Vertue, Wit, and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity.
And her Kinswoman, Madam <hi>More</hi> (not
she that I spake of before, but one I had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to know at <hi>Tunbridge</hi>) is so like her in these
Qualities, that were their Faces alike too, you cou'd
not distinguish one from t'other.</p>
                  <p>In some Conferences I had with Mr. <hi>Wallis</hi> about
my <hi>Welsh Travels,</hi> I told him I found the following
Epitaph on a Tomb-stone in <hi>Conway-Church,</hi> which
for the Remarkableness of it, I inserted in my Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;
'twas this, <q>
                        <hi>Here lies</hi> Nicholas Hooks <hi>of</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
<hi>Gent. the One and Fortieth Child of his Father,</hi>
William Hooks, <hi>
                           <abbr>Esq</abbr> by his Wife</hi> Alice; and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Twenty Seven Children himself:</hi>
                     </q> Which was
a matchless Instance of a fruitful Family. To which
Mr. <hi>Wallis</hi> reply'd, He heard there had been a Troop
in <hi>Ireland, wherein, one Mother had Two and Twenty
of her own Children listed.</hi> Having taken my leave
of Mr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> his Lady, and the rest of his Family,
my next Visit was to Sir <hi>Henry Ingoldsby,</hi> a Member
of the <hi>Privy Council</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and a Gentleman of
near Ninety Years: When I came to his House, I
sent up my Name, and Sir <hi>Henry</hi> order'd his Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to bring me into a <hi>private apartment</hi> where he
was: When I enter'd the Room, Sir <hi>Henry</hi> receiv'd
me in a courteous manner; I told him I presum'd
to wait upon him, to enquire whether my Reverend
Father, <hi>Mr. Iohn Dunton,</hi> was not once his Chaplain?
and that if he was, it must be Forty years ago.
Sir <hi>Henry</hi> did not at first remember it; but sending
to his Lady, she sent word that she did call to mind
such a Person; but 'twas added, my Father did not
live in the House, but us'd to come often to it. I
then ask'd Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> Whether one Mrs. <hi>Marry Hall</hi>
did not live with him when my Father was in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi>
for that in my Father's Will, was this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
<q>
                        <hi>Item, I bequeath unto Mrs.</hi> Mary Hall,
<hi>servant to Sir</hi> Henry Ingoldsby <hi>when I was in</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<hi>Five Pounds, if ever demanded, or she be not
dead, for her friendly Offices to me, during a great
sickness I had in that Kingdom.</hi>
                     </q> I told Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> I
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:59888:142"/>
was not put upon this Enquiry by the Executrix,
but that Providence having brought me to <hi>Ireland,</hi>
(<hi>tho' Twenty Years after my Fathers Death</hi>) I cou'd
not be satisfy'd without enquiring whether this <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Hall were alive or dead:</hi> To which Sir <hi>Henry</hi> did
me the Honour to reply, <hi>It was a Great piece of
Iustice in me,</hi> if I had no Advantage in it my self:
To which I return'd, I had not, any farther than to
see to the Execution of my Father's Will. But as
to this <hi>Mary Hall,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry</hi> told me, he suppos'd
she dy'd at <hi>Limerick,</hi> she marrying thither from his
House, to a Rich, but ill-natur'd Man, which soon
ended her Days.</p>
                  <p>Pardon me (Madam) for the digression of this
Story: I had some Hesitation in my own Breast
about making this Enquiry; I was not satisfy'd
that Conscience oblig'd me to it; but not being sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd
without doing it, I did it; and it yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
to me a <hi>moot Case,</hi> because I was none of
the Executor, I leave it to your Determination,
Whether I cou'd be under any Obligation in that
case or no? This Discourse being ended, I gave
Sir <hi>Henry</hi> an Account of the Reason of my coming
for <hi>Ireland;</hi> with which he was so well pleased, that
he promised to give me and my Auction, all the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
he cou'd; for which I return'd him
my humble Thanks, and so took my leave of
Sir <hi>Henry</hi> for that time.</p>
                  <p>Madam, I dare not presume to give Sir <hi>Henry</hi>'s
<hi>Character;</hi> to describe so great a Man would be a
Theam big enough for my Ingenious Friend,
Mr. <hi>Charles Wormington,</hi> (a Person of <hi>great Modesty
and Worth,</hi> and perhaps, the most <hi>Ingenious Poet in
all Ireland;</hi>) but tho' I shan't presume to <hi>Character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ise
this ancient Knight,</hi> yet I shall say (what every
one does) <q>That he has the Repute of a Person of
Great Honour and Probity; and of that great
Judgment and Experience in Affairs of State, as
renders him worthy of the <hi>Dignity of a Privy. Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor</hi>
                     </q>
which he has been for many years; and tho'
he is now arriv'd to Fourscore,
(<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 90: 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Ten more than the Age of Man</hi>)
yet he enjoys his Health and
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:59888:142"/>
                     <q>Strength to Admiration; which shews him to have
been a Person of <hi>great Temperance,</hi> and perhaps
(on this Account) he has no <hi>Equal in Ireland,</hi>
or it may be, in the whole World.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to proceed in my <hi>Rambles:</hi> Having taken my
leave of Sir <hi>Henry Ingoldsby,</hi> in my way home, I met
with Lieutenant <hi>Downing,</hi> my former <hi>Fellow Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller</hi>
to <hi>New England.</hi> You can hardly imagine,
Madam, how agreeable a thing it is to meet with
an <hi>old Friend in a Foreign Country:</hi> It was some
thousands of Miles off, that we were last together;
and we were equally surpriz'd to meet each other
here: There was in his Company at that time,
Captain <hi>Annesly,</hi> Son to the late Earl of <hi>Anglesey,</hi>
to whom I had the Honour to be related by my
<hi>First Wife.</hi> We stay'd not long in the Street, but
went to drink at the Widow <hi>Lisles</hi> in <hi>Castle-street:</hi>
whither <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> to go, out of a Principle of Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
hers being the first House that receiv'd me in
<hi>Dublin:</hi> After a <hi>Health to the King, (and some others
of our Friends in England</hi>) we
talk'd over our <hi>New-England</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">This American <hi>Ramble is now rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for the Press.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Ramble:</hi> After this I told
the Lieutenant of my Brother
<hi>Aanesley</hi>'s Death; at which he
was highly concern'd. This Discourse being ended,
Captain <hi>Annesley</hi> told me, That the <hi>Earl his Father,</hi>
had writ an <hi>Excellent History of Ireland;</hi> but it was
in such hands as he believ'd wou'd strip it of some
of its choicest Remarks; and (Madam) this is
likely enough; for there are some Men in the
World, which are afraid of following Truth too
close, lest it shou'd dash out their own Teeth. I
then told Captain <hi>Annesley.</hi> I had Printed his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>'s
<hi>Memoirs;</hi> (the Copy of which I purchas'd of
Sir <hi>Peter Pett</hi>) and he cou'd not but think 'em
<hi>genuine,</hi> because of that great Amity which was be
tween the Eail his Father, and Sir <hi>Peter Pett.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To give ye (Madam) the Captains Character,
<q> He is a most accomplish'd Gentleman; not (as a
Wit Observes) that thin sort of Animal that
flutters from Tavern to Play-house, and back again
all his Life; made up with <hi>Wig and Cravat,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:59888:143"/>
one dram of Thought in his Composition; but
a Person made up of <hi>Solid Worth,</hi> as Grave as
he is Witty; Brave and Generous, and shews by
his <hi>humble and courteous Carriage,</hi> that he is, and was
born, a Gentleman: And for the <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> (my
old Fellow-Traveller) I must say he has much
Address, and as great a Presence of Mind, as was
ever seen; he is most agreeable Company, and
perhaps the best Friend <hi>I had in America.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After three hours spent in this Conversation, I
went to Visit Captain <hi>Townley and his Lady;</hi>
as also one Madam <hi>Congreve;</hi> who were all <hi>three</hi>
my Fellow-Travellers in the Coach from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
to <hi>Chester:</hi> 
                     <q>The Captain is a Person of
Great Honour and Worth;</q> and so is his Lady;
but of these I shall say more in my <hi>Summer Ramble;</hi>
but more particularly of Madam <hi>Congreve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In my way home I call'd upon Mr. <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> and
his Wife (stil'd, <hi>The most Ingenious</hi>) <q>Who, tho'
she has Enemies, perhaps as little deserves 'em, as
any Woman in <hi>Dublin;</hi>
                     </q>and tho' I shou'd get ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
by saying this, yet my way is, <hi>to do as I'd bi
done by, and to speak as I find;</hi> but having Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ractarized
the <hi>most Ingenious,</hi> 'tis fit next, that I
speak of her <hi>Lord and Master;</hi> 
                     <q>He's a very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
sober Man, and one of that great Modesty,
that I heard he went Forty Miles to demand a
Debt, which yet he was so <hi>civil and courteous as</hi>
not to ask for when he came there</q>. But it grew late,
so leaving this loving Couple at their <hi>Fine Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidery,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I went next to pay a Visit to Mr. <hi>Lum</hi> in <hi>Castle-street,</hi>
(a Member of Parliament) and one of the
<hi>chief Bankers in Dublin,</hi> whom I made use of, to
remit my Moneys to <hi>London:</hi> 
                     <q>He is a Person of
great Integrity, has a good Estate, and is punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
just and honest in his Dealings. And to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
his Character, He's a Gentleman of Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Sense, which he has the Happiness of being
able to express in words, as manly and apposite as
the Sense included under them. He treated me
with much Candor and Respect, <hi>as long as I stay'd
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:59888:143"/>
in Ireland.</hi> His chief Manager of his Business
Mr. <hi>Purefoy,</hi> was also very obllging, and ready to
serve me upon all Occasions.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Captain <hi>Davis,</hi> who was also a Member of the
<hi>House of Commons,</hi> gave me <hi>a most obliging Welcome
to Dublin,</hi> at the <hi>Garter-Tavern</hi> in <hi>Castle-street:</hi>
If I shou'd attempt this Gentleman's Character, it
wou'd be to his Prejudice; for all that I can say,
will come far short of what ought to be said, For
<hi>Sense, Wit, and good Humor,</hi> there is but few can
equal, and nono that exceed him; and all these
<hi>Qualities are accompanied with great Humility.</hi>
                     </q>
Madam, I had first the honour or being acquainted
with this Gentleman at <hi>Tunbridge Wells</hi> (the same
year Mr. <hi>Wallis, his Lady, and Madam More,</hi>
drank these Mineral Waters) and this occasion'd the
repeating of what <hi>Conversation</hi> we had formerly had
at <hi>Tunbridge;</hi> from this we fell to Discourse of the
<hi>Customs and Manners of the Irish;</hi> the Captain told
me, they were naturally a very generous People,
and so kind to <hi>Strangers,</hi> that they wou'd go Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Miles to set a Man in the right way; and if he
hapned to be benighted, they wou'd give him the
best Entertainment they had, and even <hi>lye out of
their own Beds</hi> to accommodate him. <hi>To this piece
of Generosity</hi> I might add (what was told me by a
another Person) that they will likewise offer him
<hi>the convenience of a Bedfellow,</hi> in case they have a
Daughter capable of serving him: But (Madam) I
will not be answerable for the Truth of this, which
I only relate as what has been told me; and shou'd
it be true, my Opinion is, they carry <hi>their Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
a little too far.</hi> In my further Conversation
with Captain <hi>Davis.</hi> I ask'd him what <hi>Eminent
Writers they had in Ireland,</hi> and especially whether
any of the Fair Sex? To which he reply'd, they had
a very celebrated <hi>Female Poet</hi> (one Mrs. <hi>Taylor</hi>)
who had writ her own Life to a Wonder, when but
<hi>Ten Years of Age.</hi> Madam, I thought these Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Passages worth noting down in my <hi>Iournal;</hi>
but nothing did so much affect me as a <hi>Piece of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siquity</hi>
that the Captain told me he had seen with his
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:59888:144"/>
own Eyes. He had seen a Woman very perfect in
all her Senses (<hi>excepting Hearing</hi>) who said she was
<hi>under Laundress to Queen Elizabeth</hi>'s chief Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress,
and he told me he believed her to be 130
years old, which for a Woman (naturally subject to
more Infirmities than Men) I think to be very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary;
and I believe your <hi>Ladyship,</hi> will be of
my Opinion. I had the Honour of enjoying the
Captains <hi>useful and most pleasant Company</hi> for about
two <hi>Hours,</hi> when Night coming on we parted.</p>
                  <p>The day following (in the Afternoon) I went
to see my Ingenious Friend, Mr. <hi>Thwaits,</hi> his Person
is the very Picture of Mr. <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> to whom
(madam) he is so very like, both in Person and
Address (<hi>Oh what wou'd I give for such a near Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblunce
of</hi> Iris and D—ne!) that I may well affirm,
If you have seen one, you have seen the other:
And having said this, I need not tell you what an
Extraordinary Man he is: <q>Mr. <hi>Thwaits</hi> is a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of a very obliging Tempet, and I believe is as
<hi>generous to Strangers</hi> as any Man in <hi>Dublin;</hi> he
may, without Complement, be called <hi>an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd
Person;</hi> he can do almost every thing, and
tis hard to say, what he does with the greatest
Grace. And as to-Wit, I was really afraid to hold
any Argument with him, for I found he <hi>cou'd say
what he wou'd, and prove what he said;</hi> and in this
too, he resembles the Ingenious <hi>Dangerfield.</hi> In
this alone Mr. <hi>Thwaits</hi> has the Advantage, That his
whole Life has been so unblemish'd, even Envy
her self can't fix a Blot upon him. His Lady is an
Extraordinary Person, worthy of such a Husband;
and they both gave me a very generous Welcome,
worthy of themselves.</q> 
                     <hi>In our Conversation,</hi> I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd,
<hi>That a Good Wife generally, if not always,
makes a good Husband;</hi> which is undoubtedly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Fact: For tho' we suppose the Husband to be
the worst of Men, and one that abuses his Wife in
a <hi>villanous manner;</hi> yet his Spouse, if she be a good
Wife, by her meek and patient suffering under such
Abuses, cannot but some time or other (<hi>as long as
he's a Man</hi>) be overcome by the Patience of his
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:59888:144"/>
Wife, and at last be brought to compassionate her
Wrongs; and in time this Compassion may turn him
to the ways of Vertue: But then she must be <hi>as
well a good Wife, as a good Woman;</hi> for there are
many Pious Women that are far from being good
Wives. She must be one that's of a good Humor, and
always appear so to her Husband; and if in time
this does not make a <hi>Husband</hi> better, he ought to be
herded with the Brutes, and not reckon'd amongst
humane Creatures. And yet after all (Madam) I
am afraid that some such Brutes there are in the
World; but this will make nothing at all against
my Assertion, because there is <hi>no general Rule, but
admits of some Exceptions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My next Visit was to the Lady <hi>Sands,</hi> (Mr. <hi>Thwaits</hi>
Sister) I had the honour to meet her first at Mr. <hi>Shaws</hi>
(a Bookseller on <hi>Corkhill</hi>) where she invited me to
her House (here I had the good luck to meet my
ingenious Friend Mr. <hi>Thwaits</hi> a second time) <q>
                        <hi>My
Lady Sands is a Person of great Piety, and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Sence; and I found in those few Minutes I
had the Honour to enjoy her Company, that her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
is as happy in a tender, disereet and obliging
Wife, as any Gentleman in the Kingdom of Ireland.</hi>
                     </q>
In this Visit I had the Favour of some Discourse
with her eldest Daughter, whose <hi>Beauty, Vertue,
and good Humor is equal to that of the best Ladies in
Dublin.</hi> The <hi>Lady Sands,</hi> Husband is Mr. <hi>Clarksgn.</hi>
Son to Mr. <hi>David Clarkson,</hi> the late Nonconformist,
so deservedly famous for his <hi>learned Works.</hi> This
Gentleman I was formerly acquainted with, and if
I don't mistake, he was in <hi>New-England</hi> in that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
year that I <hi>rambled</hi> thither; but though we had
been <hi>old Acquaintance,</hi> I mist him in this <hi>Visit,</hi> and
never had the Happiness to see him, whilst I was
in <hi>Ireland.</hi> At taking my leave of my <hi>Lady Sands</hi>
she was pleased to send Recommendations by me to
her <hi>Mother-in-Law,</hi> now in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From my <hi>Lady Sands</hi> House I went directly to my
<hi>Auction,</hi> and in my way thither I met the <hi>Ingenious</hi>
Mr. <hi>Wright,</hi> an Ensign in the Army, but a Person of
great Perfections, both of Body and Mind. Madam,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:59888:145"/>
this Gentleman reconciles the <hi>Lyon</hi> and the <hi>Lamb</hi>
exactly; for being a Commission Officer, in the
Field he seems <hi>made only for War, and any where else
for nothing but Love.</hi> 
                     <q>He is naturally brisk and gay,
yet one of a very compassionate Temper; and I
see by him that <hi>Pitty never looks so bright as when
it shines in Steel:</hi> But why do I praise particular
Vertues, when he excells in all? He does nothing
but what looks very handsom, and there is a <hi>Charm</hi>
in the meanest, and something most bewitchingly
pleasant in the most indefensible of his Actions.</q>
He was much surprizd to see me in <hi>Ireland;</hi> for he
was Brother to one that had been my Apprentice,
which was the Original of our Acquaintance: We
met again by appointment that Night at the Tavern,
with one Mr. <hi>Young, a Gentleman of the College,</hi> and
another Gentleman to me unknown. The Ensign
told me, he had that day the Honour of Dining
with her Grace, the <hi>Dutchess of Ormond,</hi> which led
us to discourse of the matchless Vertues of that Noble
Lady, and other Subjects which I now forget.
Mr. <hi>Young</hi> also oblig'd me so far, as to settle a <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Friendship</hi> with me; and I wish I deserv'd
the Honour he did me in that matter; for he's a
Gentleman of <hi>great Humility,</hi> and I believe (<hi>if I
may judge by those few Minutes I spent in his
Conversation</hi>) never read of a Vertue, which he
did not forthwith put into Practice. One part of
our Conversation related to the <hi>Ensign,</hi> who though
the Possessor of so many Excellencies, yet continues
a single Man, which gave us occasion to wonder,
that none of the <hi>Dublin Ladies had ingross'd so rich,
a Treasure to themselves.</hi> We had appointed another
Meeting before I went away, to drink my <hi>Boon Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age;</hi>
but <hi>Wind and Tide</hi> (which stays for no Man)
hurry'd me away; so I was disappointed of my
intended Happiness, and forc'd to be so rude as to
leave <hi>Dublin,</hi> without taking leave of some other
Friends.</p>
                  <p>Having left the Ensign (and my new Friend
Mr. <hi>Young</hi>) I went next to pay my Respects to
the Reverend Mr. <hi>Iohn Boyse,</hi> whose <hi>ingenious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer</hi>
                     <pb n="337" facs="tcp:59888:145"/>
to Bishop <hi>King,</hi> and several others of his curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Composures, have so justly recommended his
<hi>Learning and Piety</hi> to the World. Madam, I have
already sent you this <hi>Gentlemans Character,</hi> and
shall speak further of him in my <hi>Summer Ramble.</hi>
He gave great Encouragement to my Auction, as
well for my own sake (as he was pleas'd to tell me)
as for my Reverend Father-in-law, Dr. <hi>Annesley</hi>'s.
He is now Preaching on the <hi>Four last Things:</hi> His
Subject was <hi>Heaven,</hi> when (Mr. <hi>Larkin,</hi> and) I
heard him; and he Preach'd in such an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
manner on that Subject, as if (with St. <hi>Paul</hi>)
he had been in the <hi>Third Heaven</hi> himself, and was
return'd to relate what he had seen.</p>
                  <p>I next Visited Mr. <hi>Sinclare,</hi> another Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
Minister, in <hi>Dublin.</hi> 
                     <q>He is a most <hi>affectionate
Preacher,</hi> and a Person of a sweet Disposition, and
extreamly obliging:</q> He gave me a hearty welcome
to his House, having been before acquainted with
me at <hi>Bristol.</hi> Some Discourses we had about
<hi>Persecution,</hi> occasion'd him to tell me, that a
Nonconformist Meeting was supprest at <hi>Gallway</hi> by
the Magistrates there, whilst a <hi>Popish Meeting</hi> was
suffer'd to be kept unmolested. He spake very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably
of my <hi>Father-in-law,</hi> Dr. <hi>Annesley:</hi> And
promis'd me, if I came again, I shou'd have all the
Encouragement that he cou'd give me. I heard
him preach on the 30<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> on <hi>Mark</hi> 9.
24. <hi>about Faith,</hi> on which he made an Excellent
Sermon.</p>
                  <p>Nor was my Happiness less in being acquainted
with Mr. <hi>Emlyn,</hi> who is Mr. <hi>Boyse</hi>'s <hi>Assistant.</hi> I
met this Gentleman several times at my Auction;
so that I find he was one of my Benefactors. <q>He's
a very <hi>solid, rational, judicious Divine,</hi> and lives
the Doctrine he Preaches.</q> I heard his Sermon to
the <hi>Society for Reformation,</hi> at <hi>New-Row,</hi> on 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>
2. 30. This Sermon is since Printed, and I wish
(Madam) I cou'd send it to ye; for some that have
read it, say a <hi>better Sermon was never publish'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the Reverend Mr. <hi>Nathaniel Weld,</hi> though I
had no Personal Acquaintance with him, yet I went
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:59888:146"/>
several times with Mr. <hi>Larkin</hi> to hear him; once
more particularly, when he preach'd on the 130<hi>th
Psalm,</hi> about <hi>Forgiveness;</hi> his whole Sermon was
very excellent, but I took more particular Notice
of the following Passages; <hi>We live upon Forgiveness
every day: What Ioy wou'd Forgiveness make in the
black Regions! The Devils nover had the offer of a
Saviour; but we are still in the Land of Hope.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Madam, I have already given you a short Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of this <hi>Pious, Learned, and Excellent Preacher,</hi>
and shall say no more of him here, but in my <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Ramble</hi> I shall give his and his <hi>Brethrens Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters</hi>
at large; for, Madam, to confess the truth
(<hi>tho' I go now and then to hear a Divine of the Church
of</hi> England, as I told ye before) yet that I more
frequently hear the <hi>Dissenting Ministers:</hi> I don't
know how your Ladyship will relish this? for I
don't remember in any Discourses we had in <hi>Dublin
(where I had first the Honour of being known to you</hi>)
that you ever mention'd your going to any Meeting;
but whatever <hi>your Practice or thoughts</hi> are in this
respect,I must acquaint you, that I practise nothing
that I think unlawful; and am very willing (when
your Ladyship has answer'd those <hi>Twelve Hundred
uncommon diverting Subjects that I intend to send ye
in so many distinct Letters)</hi> to defend my <hi>Practice in
this matter;</hi> for (Madam) there are but Thirty
Nine <hi>Articles of the Church of England,</hi> and the
<hi>Presbyterians</hi> (who are a Religious and Conscienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
People) approve of Thirty Six of 'em, and the
rest are (justly) call'd <hi>indifferent;</hi> so that (Madam)
if <hi>hereafter</hi> you'll give me leave to write to ye on
this Subject, I shall endeavour to prove <hi>(in several
Letters)</hi> that my going now and then to a Meeting
is no <hi>unnecessary Separation, or any departing from the
True Church.</hi> (For such I esteem the Church of
<hi>England.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>Madam, having visited the <hi>Nonconformists,</hi> my
next Ramble was to Mr. <hi>Harman,</hi> a young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and Son to <hi>Collonel Harman, (a Member of the
House of Commons.)</hi> In this Visit, my Friend Mr. <hi>Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin</hi>
was with me; where, after mutual Salutations,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:59888:146"/>
(and sitting down by a good Fire) we fell into a
pleasant Chat, first of <hi>Antipathles in Nature;</hi> and
here Mr. <hi>Harman</hi> told us a Story of a Gentleman
that bought a Muff; This Person had a <hi>natural An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy
against Cats,</hi> and therefore desir'd the Furrier,
who sold him the Muff, that it shou'd not be lin'd
with any <hi>Cat-skin;</hi> which the Furrier (who liv'd in
<hi>Essex-street)</hi> assur'd him it was not; upon this the
Gentleman bought it, and design'd to wear it home,
but by that this he came to <hi>Crane-lane</hi> (which was
not above a Bow-shot from the Furriers) the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
fell into a <hi>Swoon,</hi> and was taken up for dead;
but upon the taking away the Muff, he came to
himself again; but fell into a great Rage against the
Furrier, threatning to kill him; which he having
notice of, got out of the way.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Harman</hi>'s Discourse being ended, I next told
the Story of my <hi>Aversion to Cheese</hi> when I was young;
and how my Father's causing me to eat it unknown,
had like to have kill'd me; which <hi>Aversion</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
I afterwards overcame; and now love
Cheese aswell as any Man. We then discours'd of
the <hi>Antipathy that Cats have to Men;</hi> and of their
taking away Mens Breath when asleep, with other
things to that purpose: This led us to talk of <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy,</hi>
and the Wonders thereof; and more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
of Sir <hi>Kenelm Dighy</hi>'s <hi>Sympathetical Powder,</hi>
and the great Cures wrought by it. From hence we
fell to talk of a third Wonder in Nature, viz. <hi>Mens
walking in their Sleep;</hi> of which Mr. <hi>Larkin</hi> gave a
memorable Relation of a House supposed to be
haunted; which was only occasioned by one of the
Gentlemans Daughters, <hi>who walked in her Sleep eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Night;</hi> which was at last discover'd by a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger's
having Courage enough to lie in the Room
said to be haunted: This naturally led us in the
fourth place, to talk of <hi>Apparitions;</hi> and here
Mr. <hi>Harman</hi> ask'd me what I thought of a <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrum</hi>'s
<hi>assuming a Humane Shape?</hi> I assur'd him
they might; and to confirm this, told him the
Story of one <hi>Ioseph Chambers,</hi> who appeard to
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:59888:147"/>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">This <hi>Mary Gossam</hi> is still living.</note> 
                     <hi>Mary Gossam</hi> (with whom I was
well acquainted) in that very
<hi>Night-Cap</hi> which she put upon
his Head when she had laid him
out.</p>
                  <p>This Story of <hi>Chambers</hi> appearing after his Death,
led Mr, <hi>Larkin</hi> to tell another of an <hi>Apparision</hi> he
had seen in <hi>Staffordshire</hi> in his Youth, which he
thought had been a <hi>living Woman,</hi> till he saw it va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish;
adding, That he look'd upon the <hi>denying of
Spirits, and their appearing to Persons after Death,
to be the next degree to Atheism.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After about two hours spent in such <hi>agreeable
Conversation,</hi> we took our leave of Mr. <hi>Harman,</hi>
                     <q>Who is a Gentleman of a fine Presence, and of
a most sweet and affable Temper. He is now in
the <hi>Bloom and Beauty of his Youth;</hi> and his great
Ingenuity and close Application to his Study, do
justly render him the <hi>growing hopes of his Father's
Family,</hi> and may in time to come, render him an
Ornament to the College.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am afraid, <hi>Madam,</hi> I shall tire you with this
tedious Relation of my <hi>Visits;</hi> but I hope your
<hi>Goodness</hi> will pardon me; for 'tis necessary to be
thus particular, that I may silence the lying Tongue
of <hi>Patrick Campbel,</hi> who has had the Impudence to
say, That I kept Company in <hi>Dublin,</hi> with none
but a <hi>Kennel of Scoundrels:</hi> Whereas you see (by the
Visits I made) That I was not acquainted with one
<hi>Scoundrel</hi> in <hi>Dublin,</hi> except himself, and the <hi>Brass</hi>
in <hi>Copper-Allcy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This naturally brings me to acquaint your <hi>Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>
That among those I Employ'd to bind <hi>up Books
for my Auction,</hi> 
                     <q>I had to do with one that I call
Brass, <hi>a Man poor and Proud, unacquainted with
Honour or good Manners;</hi> to supply the want of
which, he is well furnished with Conceit and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence.</q>
Being thus qualified, he was look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by St. <hi>Patrick</hi> as a fit Tool for him; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
chosen for his <hi>Auctioneer,</hi> though he knew not
how to read the Title of a <hi>Latin Book.</hi> But the
Gentlemen of <hi>Dublin,</hi> who had been genteely treated
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:59888:147"/>
with <hi>Wit and Sense at my Auction</hi> by Mr. <hi>Wilde,</hi>
could not bear with the gross Ignorance of a <hi>Brass
Hammer;</hi> so that <hi>Patrick</hi> was forc'd
to discard him in a Weeks time, and
<hi>put a better Man</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Mr. Shaw <hi>of</hi> Cork-hill.</note> in his Place.
This <hi>Brass</hi> knowing the necessity
I was under of having my Books bound in order to
sale, resolves to make me pay a rate for Binding,
not only beyond what was given in <hi>London,</hi> but even
beyond what was given by the <hi>Booksellers of Dublin:</hi>
I found, Madam, I was in his hands, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd
the Proverb, <hi>That he that's in a Boat with the
Devil, must land where he can.</hi> There was a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of having my Books bound, and I was forc'd
to comply with his unreasonable Rates. How this
consisted with <hi>Iustice and Equity,</hi> I leave you to
judge; but those were things <hi>Brass</hi> never troubled
his Head about; for when he brought me in his
Bill, he over-charg'd even his own <hi>unreasonable
Agreement,</hi> which I refus'd to pay; but offer'd to
refer it to one <hi>Mr. Servant</hi> (a Binder in <hi>Golden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane)</hi>
with whom I had made the same agreement
as I did with him; but <hi>Servant</hi> being a very honest
man, <hi>Brass,</hi> refus'd to have the thing decided by
him, because then he was sure 'twould go against
him: And therefore this Fellow (who for his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
I call the <hi>Brass in Copper-Alley</hi>) serves me
with a Token from the Lord Mayor, to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, which I accordingly did; (as I formerly
hinted in <hi>p.</hi> 104. of the <hi>Dublin Scuffle</hi>) and having
told his Lordship what I had offer'd, he was pleas'd
to say, It was a <hi>very fair Proposal I made him,</hi>
and so dismiss'd us both, which was all he got by
his <hi>Two-penny Token.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having done with this <hi>Scoundrel</hi> (to use St. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick</hi>'s
Phrase) I will next give you an Abstract of
Mr. <hi>Servant</hi>'s Character, who, though of the same
Function, is the direct Antipodes to the <hi>Brass</hi> of
<hi>Copper-Alley;</hi> this being as eminent for <hi>Honesty, fair
Dealing, Truth, and Iustice,</hi> as the other is for
<hi>Pride, Conceit, and Ignorance.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Servant</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
does not need a Foil to set it off: <q>For he
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:59888:148"/>
is well known in <hi>Dublin</hi> to be all that I here say.
But I shall add to the good Character he has
already, that I never met with a more scrupu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ous,
or conscientious Man in my whole Life; he's pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
to his word in the smallest matters, and one
that manages all his Affairs with Discretion: Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
and affable in his Conversation, and ready
to do every one what good he can. In short, his
Life is the <hi>Exemplar of a Christians Practice.</hi>
                     </q> But
leaving <hi>Thomas, &amp;c.</hi> hard at work, (for he's a very
industrious Man)</p>
                  <p>My next Visit shall be to Mr. <hi>Iey,</hi> and Eminent
Lawyer in <hi>Dublin.</hi> He was a Benefactor to my
Auction, and my very sincere Friend: And to say
the Truth, whatever the Lawyers are in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
yet in <hi>Ireland they are the best Gentlemen and
the best Christians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From hence, to close the Evening, I went to take
a Dish at <hi>Patt</hi>'s, <q>who is a fair-condition'd Man,
and very obliging to all his Customers: <hi>Loving to
do business without making a noise on't.</hi> 'Twas here
I sometimes met with Mr. <hi>Pitts,</hi> an honest and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
Attorney, a Man of good Worth, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemish'd
in his Reputation, Madam, he talks
finely (dresses his Thoughts in curious Language)
and has good Nature in his very Looks; he is a
true lover of the present Government, and a brave
Assertor of English Liberties, in opposition to Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Slavery.</q> I wou'd say more of the ingenious
<hi>Pitts,</hi> but that I shall meet him again in my <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Ramble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Madam, just as I left <hi>Patts,</hi> I met with my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
and ingenious Friend, Dr. <hi>Wood,</hi> Physician in
<hi>Kilkenny,</hi> with whom, and Dr. <hi>Smith.</hi> I spent some
agreeable Hours, of which expect a fuller Account
in the conclusion of this Letter; and also in my
<hi>Summer Ramble,</hi> where you'll also meet the Discourse
I had with a Gentleman about the Earl of <hi>Meath</hi>'s
<hi>Hunting Pigg,</hi> which will be very diverting.</p>
                  <p>And now Madam, as your <hi>several Directions</hi> to
me inform'd you of the changing of my Lodgings,
so I think it proper here to give you my <hi>Reasons</hi> for
so doing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="359" facs="tcp:59888:148"/>
My first Lodging was at a <hi>Counsellors in Wine-Tavern-street,</hi>
who being in some danger of <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
the Law</hi> (for he had out-ran his own Practice)
left his House, and as 'tis suppos'd, the Kingdom
too. Yet I must say, <hi>'As to his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
he's a Gentleman;</hi> (tho' un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Cloud) and sings (I'll find<note n="*" place="margin">'Tis a Line in a New Song.</note> out
a kinder, a better than she, beyond
any Man in <hi>Christendom:</hi>) and as for
his Lady, she deserves the following Character;
<q>
                        <hi>She</hi>'s <hi>discreet and witty, the best of Wives;</hi> and I
hear, has the Name for being a Beauty;</q> 'tis true,
I never thought her so, but I am no Judge I find;
for she's <hi>bright and fair;</hi> and those that admire a
R—d Colour, <hi>cry, there's no Sun but in her Eyes;</hi>
but as famous as she is for <hi>Beauty,</hi> I must own,
while I liv'd with her, I saw nothing but what was
<hi>Modest and Honourable;</hi> and I shall ever have some
Kindness for Counsellor H—as he was the occasion
of my being acquainted with my worthy Friend,
Mr. <hi>William Wainwright;</hi> 
                     <q>who, tho' he lives a
Batcheler, is a Person of <hi>strict Modesty,</hi> and has the
<hi>symptoms of a good Christian;</hi> for he's sincere in
what he says, and is as <hi>Religious in all his Actions;</hi>
and to crown his Character, he's a Person of great
Humility, and of a <hi>most sweet natural Temper;</hi>
and (Madam) I must say, there's no <hi>Vertue I'd
wish in a Friend,</hi>
                     </q> but I find it in <hi>William Wain-wright.</hi>
He was the first Acquaintance I had in
<hi>Dublin;</hi> and we were so little weary of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that he was one of those that saw me a <hi>Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board</hi>
(when I left <hi>Ireland</hi>) tho' to the hazard of
his Life, for I sail'd in a sort of a Storm.</p>
                  <p>And as I thank H—for bringing me acquainted
with this worthy Gentleman, so I'm oblig'd to him
for the favour he did me in first making me known
tot he vertuous and ingenious <hi>Mrs. Edwards,</hi> whose
Character (Madam) I shall here give you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>She's a Country Gentlewoman, of admirable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of <hi>Body and Mind;</hi> modest to the highest
degree, and of a most agreeable Conversation;
with which, for my own part, I was very much
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:59888:149"/>
delighted; and I am ready to flatter my self, mine
was not altogether ungrateful to her; and how
can you blame me (Madam) to think thus, since
a Lady of <hi>your Quality</hi> has not disdain'd to grant
me the honour of a Correspondence with you.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Apelles,</hi> the famous Painter of <hi>Greece,</hi> when
he was to draw <hi>any curious Picture,</hi> wou'd have se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>celebrated Beauties</hi> before him, that he might
draw an <hi>Eye</hi> from this, a <hi>Mouth</hi> from that, and a
<hi>Meen</hi> from t'other, &amp;c. Had Mrs. <hi>Edwards</hi> liv'd in
the time of <hi>Apelles,</hi> he need not have <hi>hunted about
for Beauties,</hi> for he had found 'em all in this vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Person; so I'll descend (for my general Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
don't set her in a full Light) to a more <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Description</hi> of her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>And I'll begin first with her <hi>Face,</hi> which is neither
oval nor long; her Hair is black, or near it (and
then I need no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> tell ye 'tis charming.) As to her
<hi>Eyebrows,</hi> they are a great Ornament to her Face,
and look as exact as if the Hand of <hi>Art and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
had been at Work. Excellently well propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
is her Nose, not sharp nor big; but gives a
noble Air to her Face. Her <hi>Mouth</hi> little and pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
her <hi>Lips</hi> of a charming Red;</q>
                     <q>
                        <l>And do like to the Twins of <hi>Cupid's</hi> Mother,</l>
                        <l>still kiss, because in love with one another.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Her <hi>Teeth</hi> are even and well set, and look as
white as <hi>Snow.</hi> Her <hi>Eyes</hi> (her tempting Eyes)
full of fire and briskness, and temper'd with an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive
languishing. As to her <hi>Neck and Breasts</hi>
they are the best sized that ever you saw, and of
a <hi>dazling whiteness,</hi> as well as her Arms and Hands
As to her Body, 'tis small, and of a curious shape,
and is supported with <hi>handsom Legs,</hi> as I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
(for I never saw 'em.) As to her <hi>Stature,</hi>
she is of a little pitch; and is so neat, so free, so
disingag'd, that there's few like her; (save <hi>Rachel
Seaton,</hi> whose Picture she is) and Mr.—who
unsuccessfully attempted her Chastity, swears at
her Vertue, and often wishes she had fewer Charms.
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:59888:149"/>
She hath a noble <hi>Air in her Walk,</hi> and has the Dress,
Looks, and Behaviour of a Gentlewoman; and
wants nothing but a Fortune to make her so: In
a word, she has something so <hi>distingushing in her
whole Person,</hi> that when she was single (for you'll
hear by and by she's marry'd) she more distress'd
her Husband's Liberty, than others did with all
their <hi>Art, and more curious Dresses;</hi> so much for
her Person.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>As to her Mind, which is the Charm of Charms
(you know Madam, I ever thought so) she's Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
but not a jot reserv'd; and has more Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in her Heart than Eyes. As to her Wit and
Singing, it so strangely surpriz'd me that day she
went with the Counsellor to <hi>Malhide</hi> (which <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture</hi>
you'll have in my <hi>Summer Ramble)</hi> that I
am hardly yet come to my self; for I cou'd not
conceive how a Female cou'd have
(in that mean Cabin<note n="*" place="margin">At Bally Many.</note> where she
dwells) all the <hi>Politeness and Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments
of a Court.</hi> As to her
Heart I can say nothing, and 'tis not sit I shou'd;
but (Madam) this I'll say (by being a <hi>Platonick
Lover;</hi> for I am the same in <hi>Dublin</hi> as I was in
<hi>London)</hi> she allows me all the Liberty I ask, or
Vertue will give, which can't be much; for I have
a Wife of my own, that's (far) <hi>more charming in
my Eye,</hi> and one I love above all the World; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
I am by <hi>Nature as cold as Ice,</hi> and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
(If I may trust my <hi>Eyes and Ears)</hi> that she's
Chast, so much as in Thought. And as she's very
Innocent, so of consequence very <hi>Charitable,</hi> and
<hi>speaks ill of nothing.</hi>
                     </q> Madam, she has other <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Qualities</hi> I cou'd tell you of, (for this is
but a hasty draught of this Excellent Person) but
here's enough to shew what Mrs. <hi>Edwards</hi> really is,
and what all her Sex shou'd be.</p>
                  <p>And now Madam, who'd think that a Person of
such Vertue, shou'd have any Enemies? But as
<hi>Dryden</hi> says, <hi>The Butt of Envy still is Excellence;</hi>
and she is not without slander, tho' (I had almost
said) she as little deserve, it as Vertue it self;
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:59888:150"/>
but the <hi>very Reflections</hi> she meets with (as well as
her real Vertues) do but add further to her good<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
Character; for 'tis none but <hi>Scoundrels</hi> (I mean
such as wou'd corrupt her Vertue and can't) that
give her an ill word; she's <hi>proof against the blaze of
Gold:</hi> Then no wonder if a <hi>Town-Bull</hi> (such a one
as <hi>A—S—)</hi> shou'd abuse that Vertue he can't de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch:
Such as these reflect on a Woman, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
she's lewd, but because they find her too Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
(too <hi>Platonick)</hi> for their Embraces; 'tis this,
like <hi>Esop</hi>'s Fox, makes 'em cry, <hi>the Grapes are sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi>
But the bad word of a lewd Person is the best
<hi>Encomium</hi> a Vertuous Woman can have; for 'tis by
the Judgment of Sober People that a Reputation
stands or falls; and by all such Mrs. <hi>Edwards</hi> was
highly valued. I am told, that noless a Person than
the Countess of <hi>Meath,</hi> honoured her with a tender
Friendship: The Lady <hi>Davis,</hi> and Madam <hi>Gilbert</hi>
do the same; and she's as kindly receiv'd in
Mr. <hi>Vsher</hi>'s Family: Mr. <hi>Meegee</hi> and his Wife (Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of great Piety) scarce covet any other Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
Mrs. <hi>Brown</hi> at the <hi>Currow</hi> has a particular Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
for her; Mrs. <hi>Persons,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Ware,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Ryley,</hi>
have the like; and wherever she boards, they are
scarce easie a minute without her. Then Madam, I
shan't ask your Pardon (or <hi>Valeria</hi>'s either) for my
giving this tender Character of Mrs. <hi>Edwards;</hi> for
as you are both Vertuous Persons, you'd surely be
angry with me, shou'd I forbear praising what so
much deserves it. Besides, I am mistaken in both
of ye, if your great Innocence don't set you above
suspicion; ('tis only guilty People are Jealous;) or
if it don't (to tell you the plain truth) my Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
is too great to need my concealing my
Thought of her; and the rather still, as her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
has said (in the presenceof Mr. <hi>Larkin)</hi> that
had he ever been Jealous ofher (as he never was
in his whole Life) yet that he shou'd now believe
her Vertuous, <hi>for my having a good Opinion of her;</hi>
which I don't speak out of Ostentation, but to shew
her Innocence, and my own too. Thus (Madam)
you see, by my <hi>Character of Mrs. Edwards,</hi> that
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:59888:150"/>
my Vertue is safe enough; for tho' she's a Woman
(a thing in Petticoate) yet my Love is all <hi>Platomak,</hi>
to all, except <hi>Valarid.</hi> (So <hi>Angels Love, and all the
rest is dross.)</hi> Really Madam, I am such an Enemy
to running astray, that I heathily wish <hi>Adultery

<hi>his own Breast</hi> to damp his consuring me, or that

                  <p>You see (Madam) by these words, that I am a
great Enemy to Complements; nay, I often wish
(as <hi>Valeria says)</hi> that there were no such thing in
the World; and when <hi>I am dead and gone,</hi> I wou'd
willingly come again to contrdict any one that

                  </p>
                  <p>Madam, having given ye <hi>the true Character of
Mrs. Edwards,</hi> perhaps you'll be desirous to know
who 'tis that is blest with so <hi>great Treasure;</hi> which
obliges me to give ye the following Character of
Mr. <hi>Edwards:</hi> 
                     <q>He is a Person of an indifferent
Stature, neither tall, nor short; and tho' no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender
to any extraordinary Perfections, is far
from being contemptible: <hi>He has a Martial Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and a Mind like it,</hi> and will turn his back
to no man in a just Cause, nor receive an Affront
from any. He has not indeed the Politeness of a
Courtier, but <hi>an honest bluntness,</hi> that better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
him: His only fault is, he has been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unkind to his Wife; but he has made her part
of amends, both in a just acknowledgment, and
by an extraordinary fondness since; upon which
she has been so generous to forgive him; and he
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:59888:151"/>
takes it so very kindly,</q> that they are now as <hi>happy
a Couple</hi> as any that live in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having left the <hi>Counsellors House,</hi> (where I came,
acquainted with Mr. <hi>Wainwright,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Edwards,</hi>
whose Characters I have here sent ye) I retreated
for a little Air and Solitude, to <hi>Arbo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r-hill</hi> (a mile
from <hi>Dublin)</hi> to the House of one Mr. <hi>Thomas Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
who with his Wife (an antient couple) seem
to be like <hi>Adam and Eve in Paradise;</hi> he employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself in his Garden (where I have a Nosegay
ev'ry Morning, my Landlady finding I admire
Flowers) and she within doors in making of <hi>Milk-water,</hi>
of which she distills very large quantities.
I think my self obliged to let 'em live as long as
this Paper holds, in Gratitude for those <hi>Parental
Tendernesses</hi> they shew'd me when I languish'd with
the <hi>Bloody-Flux;</hi> (which seiz'd me in this House.)

                     </hi> who had
one night torn me to pieces,
had not the <hi>drawing my Sword</hi> baulk'd his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
                  <p>Madam, <hi>the Reason of my coming to this Country-Seat,</hi>
was my great Indisposition of Body, and being
tyred with the <hi>Hurries of Dublin;</hi> I have in my
<hi>Dublin Scuffle</hi> given ye my thoughts of a <hi>Private
Life,</hi> for I am as great an Admirer of it, as your
<hi>Ladyship is of Gardens;</hi> and I suppose you won't
blame me for it; for the three first Men in the
World were a <hi>Gardiner,</hi> a <hi>Plowman,</hi> and a <hi>Grasier;</hi>
even the <hi>Great Cowley,</hi> that had known what <hi>Cities,
Vniversities,</hi> and <hi>Courts</hi> cou'd afford, broke through
all the intanglements of it; and which was harder,
a <hi>vast Praise;</hi> and retired to a solitary Cottage near
<hi>Barn-Elms,</hi> where his Garden was his Pleasure, and
he his own <hi>Gardiner;</hi> whence he giveth us this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<hi>Doctrine of Retirement;</hi> and may (as <hi>William
Pen</hi> says) serve for an Account how well he was
pleased in his change. The first Work (saith he)
that a man must do to make himself capable of <hi>the
good of Solitude,</hi> is the very <hi>Eradication of all Lusts;</hi>
                     <pb n="365" facs="tcp:59888:151"/>
for how is it possible for a man to enjoy himself,
while his Affections are tyed to things without him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
The <hi>First Minister of State</hi> hath not so much
business in Publick, as a <hi>wise Man hath in Private;</hi>
if the one have little leisure to be alone, the other
hath less leisure to be in Company; the one hath
but <hi>part of the Affairs of one Nation,</hi> the other all
the <hi>Works of God and Nature</hi> under his Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
There is no saying shocks me so much, as that
which I hear very often, <hi>That a man doth not know
how to pass his Time:</hi> 'Twou'd have been but ill
spoken by <hi>Methusalem</hi> in the Nine Hundred Sixty
Ninth Year of his Life; the meaning of all this is
no more than that vulgar saying, <hi>Bene qui latuit,
bene vixit; He hath lived well, who hath lain well
hidden;</hi> which if it be a truth, the World is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
deceiv'd; for my part I think it is; and that
the pleasantest condition of Life is in <hi>Incognito:</hi>
What a brave Priviledge it is to be free from all
Noise and Nonsence; from all envying, or being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyed;
from receiving and paying all kind of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies:
our Senses here are feasted with the, <hi>clear
and genuine Taste</hi> of their Objects, which are all so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisticated
in Courts and Cities. <hi>Charles</hi> V. <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
of Germany,</hi> after conquering four King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> resign'd up all his Pomp to other Hands,
and betook himself to his <hi>Retirement,</hi> leaving this
Testimony behind him, concerning the Life he spent
in that little time of his retreat from the World,
<hi>That the sincere study of the Christian Religion had in
it such Ioys and Sweetness, as Courts were Strangers
to.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus Madam have I sent you the true Reason for
my leaving Counsellor H—, and betaking my self
to a <hi>Private Life;</hi> wherein, not only <hi>Antiquity</hi>
pleads for me, but the Example of <hi>Cowley,</hi> and the
best and greatest Men of the Age.</p>
                  <p>And Madam, as I am charm'd with a <hi>private Life,</hi>
and with every day a green Prospect, so there is a
dainty one adjoyning (Mr. <hi>Orson's</hi> House) my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Quarters; where I often wander up and down
to think <hi>of you, and the Dear Valeria.</hi> I told you
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:59888:152"/>
before, 'twas my <hi>fortune to Travel;</hi> and even in <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
it self, I am not without my Rambles: One I
make to represent <hi>Drapers Garden:</hi> The other <hi>Step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
Fields:</hi> Another St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s <hi>Park:</hi> And when
I pass through <hi>Skinner Row (where the Scuffle was</hi>)
methinks I am in <hi>Cheapside,</hi> and shall soon be at
the <hi>Raven</hi> in <hi>Iewin-street,</hi> the
only <hi>House on Earth</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">As is hinted in the Dublin Scuffle.</note> 
                     <hi>I love,</hi>
Pray Madam let me know if it
stands in the old place; 'tis a
mighty Pleasure for us Travellers, to hear how Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
goe in <hi>England.</hi> But as much as I love the
<hi>Raven,</hi> I thought my self very happy at Mr. <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>'s
(I mean as happy as I cou'd be without <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.)
But how uncertain are worldly Comforts?</hi> For I
had not (Madam) sojourned many days at Mr. <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>'s
House, but I fell sick (as I said before) of the
<hi>Bloody Flux,</hi> the usual distemper of the Country,
and many times fatal; so that I might have <hi>iust
Apprehensions</hi> of a speedy dissolution of my Earthly
Frame, I being at best of no strong Constitution:
To say I had no <hi>fear of Death</hi> at all upon me under
these Circumstances, would savour more of an hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
insensibility of Heart, and Pagan ignorance,
than the Piety and Consideration of a Christian;
but herein an <hi>enumeration of the particulars of my past
Life</hi> was presented to me, and things appear'd with
very different Aspects, but yet not so frightful, but
that through the Divine Goodness, I had hopes left
of the Remission of all my Sins, upon the <hi>sole Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of my Saviour's Merits;</hi> but I dare not be so
presumptuous, as to say, my Faith amounted to an
assurance of my Eternal Salvation: Yet I may say,
I began more seriously than ever, to consider what
I <hi>was; whence I came; and whether I was going?</hi>
For (Madam) as I said before, a <hi>near prospect of
Death</hi> makes the World, and all things in it, appear
with a quite different face from what it did. The
belief I shou'd now dye, made me to think why
I liv'd; where I shou'd be buried, and what wou'd
become of me after Death? I now began to review
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:59888:152"/>
the <hi>whole Course of my Life;</hi> and
whether, if Time wou'd<note n="*" place="margin">See my fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well to Dublin.</note> 
                     <hi>unweave
my Life again to the first thread,</hi> I
wou'd live just as I had done?
<hi>Ah! Madam, the fashion of the World passes away;</hi>
and a sick-bed presently convinces us of the Vanity
of Riches, Honours, Pleasures; <hi>How mean and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
do these things appear in the Eyes of a dying
Man?</hi> They can't help us to a good Conscience;
give a Minutes ease, or save from the Grave: Sure
I am, whilst my Distemper lasted, wou'd any one
ha' given me the <hi>whole World,</hi> I cou'd ha' thought
of nothing but the <hi>Terrors of Death, the certainty of
Iudgment, the Glories of Heaven, the Torments of Hell,
the Comforts of a good Conscience;</hi> and what I must
do to be saved, with the necessity of a good Life;
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> through Mercy I am now recover'd, I hope
to the end of my Life, I shall think of the World
just as I did <hi>when I thought I was leaving it;</hi> and to
this end I desire Death may be much in my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>houghts,
and the remaining, part of my Life <hi>a continual Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
for it.</hi> We read of one, that every time he
heard the <hi>Clock,</hi> cryed, well, now I have one hour
less to live. I wish I cou'd imitate this good Man;
however, I will look upon every day as if it were
my last; that so when <hi>Death comes in earnest,</hi> I may
be ready and willing to dye; and after Death I
doubt not but my Body will rise again; I will
therefore no longer spend my Hours in pampering
of that which will be food for Worms. But I will
not, Madam, enter upon all the <hi>Conceptions and
Idea's</hi> I had in this Sickness, of the future World;
some of 'em being perhaps more the fancy of my
own Brain, than any true Representation of the
thing it self: But it having pleased Almighty God
to make my Illness of a short Duration, <hi>I shall from
the more Melancholly Scene of Death, pass to the
more pleasing Actions of Life;</hi> and take the liberty
to acquaint ye, that I now began to visit my Friends,
and to take some innocent Diversion abroad: But
(Madam) <hi>no Pleasure is lasting with me</hi> (I find;)
for I had not been long <hi>recovered,</hi> and able to walk
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:59888:153"/>
abroad, but I was hurry'd from my <hi>Dublin Paradise;</hi>
(I mean Mr. <hi>Orson</hi>'s House) for Mr. <hi>Wild</hi> (who
manag'd my <hi>Auction</hi>) being just now arriv'd from
<hi>London,</hi> I was forc'd to remove to Mr. <hi>Landers</hi>'s in
<hi>Capel-street,</hi> that I might be nearer my Business;
<q>Mr. <hi>Landers's Character resembles that of old</hi> Jacob,
<hi>being a plain, but sincere hearted Man;</hi> and his
Wife as good a Landlady, and <hi>one of the best of
Nurses for an infirm Person,</hi>
                     </q> which was then my
Condition; nor must I forget honest <hi>Kate,</hi> their
Servant, whose Readiness and Care to please me,
supply'd her want of Understanding (Point-work.)</p>
                  <p>But that my Condition in my <hi>Absence</hi> from <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>
might truly resemble that of a <hi>Pilgrim,</hi> who is
continually in motion, I was forc'd to remove yet
nearer my Auction, upon the Information I receiv'd
of my <hi>Porter's being turn'd Thief;</hi> so that from
<hi>Landers</hi>'s House I remov'd to Mr. <hi>Cawley</hi>'s, at the
<hi>Tennis-Court</hi> in <hi>Wine-Tavern-street.</hi> 
                     <q>Mr. <hi>Cawley</hi> is
a very humble and agreeable Person, civil and
obliging to all his Lodgers; and I must say (to
do him right) to me in a very particular manner;
and so was his Wife also, who is a very ingenious,
discreet, and prudent Person; and both of 'em ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
an <hi>uncommon concern</hi> at my parting with
them,</q> which was not until I came for <hi>England:</hi>
Nor must I forget my <hi>Kinswoman Iuggee</hi> (as I us'd
to call her) who was their trusty Servant.</p>
                  <p>Thus Madam, I have briefly given you an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the <hi>Reasons and Causes I had for my seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Removes from one Lodging to another;</hi> and how
happy I was in meeting with <hi>kind Landlords.</hi> And
were I in <hi>England</hi> again (and I cast longing looks
that way evry day) I'd say more in their Praise;
but oh this <hi>cruel distance!</hi> well, had I the same
advantage of speed to send unto you at this time in
this place, as they have from <hi>Scandaroon,</hi> when,
upon the coming in of any Ship into Harbor, they
use to send their Letters by Pigeons to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and
other Places; I say (Madam) had I such an <hi>airy
Postilion,</hi> I'd send ye these <hi>Occurrences</hi> more at
large.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="369" facs="tcp:59888:153"/>
Madam, If you shou'd ask me, which I lik'd best
of my four Lodgings, my Answer is, I look'd upon
'em all <hi>as Places I must quickly leave,</hi> which made
'em all indifferent to me; but cou'd I have enjoy'd
<hi>Valeria</hi> there, I shou'd have given the Preference to
Mr. <hi>Orson</hi>'s, his curious Gardens being very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful,
and his House a (<hi>private</hi>) Country-Seat.</p>
                  <p>Thus Madam, I have given you a brief Account
of my way of <hi>Living in Dublin;</hi> with which (had
I had <hi>Valeria</hi>'s ('batying Company) I shou'd have thought
my self very happy; for through the Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
(bating my first fit of Sickness) I enjoy'd a
competent measure of Health; those other <hi>Indisposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
I sometimes met with, serv'd only as <hi>Memen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to's,</hi>
to put me in mind of <hi>preparing for another
W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rld;</hi> and even under them, I was <hi>chearful and
well contented;</hi> having (tho, not exempt from
humane Infirmities) no guilt of any wilful Sin ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on my Conscience; so that all troublesome
Thoughts were banish'd from my Breast, and I
pass'd away my Life with great <hi>Delight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now being pretty well, I had a mind to
ramble into the Country for a little <hi>Conversation
among the Irish</hi> (of which more anon) and to view
the <hi>Cabins, Manners, and Customs, &amp;c.</hi> of the <hi>dear
Ioyes;</hi> but the Company I met in <hi>Dublin</hi> was so
agreeable, I cou'd not presently leave it; and
which made it yet the more delightful (after my
Recovery) I sometimes convers'd with Counsellor
<hi>Kairns,</hi> Counsellor <hi>Stevens,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bourn,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Crawcroft,</hi> Men eminent for <hi>Piety, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Learning, and all other Vertues;</hi> by whose Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
I improv'd my own Understanding; and
found that the knowledge of my own Ignorance,
was a <hi>great step</hi> towards being a good Proficient in
the School of Wisdom.</p>
                  <p>When I cou'd not have such Company, I gave
my self to Reading some useful Book or other (the
<hi>Bible</hi> having always the preference) and afterwards
to writing my <hi>American Travels,</hi> and <hi>Summer Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
both which I begun and finish'd in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="370" facs="tcp:59888:154"/>
I enjoy'd also (especially when I lay at Mr. <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>'s)
the Pleasure of walking in a <hi>delightful Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
well furnish'd with the most curious Herbs and
Flowers; whose <hi>various Colours</hi> delighted my Eye,
and their Fragrancy my Smell: Besides which, I
had the Satisfaction of a lovely <hi>Prospect;</hi> South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
towards the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> I had the silent
Murmurs of the River <hi>Lyffee</hi> in my way; Westward
I had a full view of <hi>Kilmanum</hi> Hospital, which at
that distance (being seated on the summit of a
Hill) was a very agreeable Prospect. To the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
(or rather the Northwest) I had the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
sight of a Village call'd <hi>Kabragh,</hi> which was
pretty near; and at a greater distance, the fine
Town of <hi>Finglass,</hi> seated on a Hill, where I had a
<hi>noble Prospect</hi> of the Sea, and of all the Ships in the
Harbor of <hi>Dublin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes I wou'd walk down from my Lodging
to the River-side, which was not a Mile from it,
where the <hi>pleasant Rills</hi> of running Water were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
delightful.</p>
                  <p>At other times I wou'd walk through those green
Meadows from the end of <hi>Stony-batter</hi> to the <hi>Ka<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragh,</hi>
which is a Village about a Mile from my
Lodging, full of stately Trees, which gives a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
shade, and delightful Prospect. From whence,
as I came back, I had the <hi>Sea and Harbour</hi> direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in my View.</p>
                  <p>And sometimes, Madam, I walk to <hi>Chappel-Izod,</hi>
to visit the Lord <hi>Clonuff,</hi> who is President of the
Illustrious House of <hi>Cabinteelee,</hi> and confers Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
as freely as a <hi>Prince,</hi> tho' with more Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
than those of the <hi>Round-Table:</hi> During the

<hi>Four Noble-Men,</hi> of which the Duke of <hi>Fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

one; the Marquess of <hi>Swan-Castle</hi> carrying the Sword,
and assisting at the Ceremony; but more of this in
my <hi>Summer Ramble,</hi> where you'll have the History of
my Lord <hi>Clonuff</hi> at large, with a merry <hi>Account</hi> of

the President has conferr'd; with an <hi>exact

                     <pb n="371" facs="tcp:59888:154"/>
Sometimes I wou'd for my <hi>Diversion,</hi> ride out
a few Miles, either to <hi>Santry, Swords,</hi> or <hi>Mallahide;</hi>
a Place as Eminent as <hi>Billinsgaie</hi> for Peoples going
to eat Oysters there: And that which made these

though at a distance, the <hi>Sea</hi> within my view,
which I like well enough on shore, but not on
board, for I am always sick on the Ocean.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes I walk along the <hi>Strand,</hi> up to <hi>Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarff,</hi>

                  <p>And sometimes I went to the <hi>Dublin</hi> Bowling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Green
(perhaps the finest in <hi>Europe</hi>) either to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert

look'd on, I cou'd not but reflect <hi>how like the Iack
is to the World,</hi> which most men <hi>covet</hi> with the
greatest Earnestness, but very few obtain. And
when sometimes I saw a Bowl (<hi>play'd by a skilful

have gotten an Estate, by one or other unforeseen

                  <p>This Letter had that Effect, that Dr. <hi>Wood</hi> and
his Lady gave me a hearty Welcome, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
brought me into the Company of several
Gentlemen of <hi>Worth and Quality.</hi> I came to <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenny</hi>
on <hi>Friday</hi> Night; and the next Morning
the Doctor carried me to view the <hi>Castle,</hi> (the
noble Seat of the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi>) of which
I shall give a most particular Account in my <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Ramble.</hi> And indeed the <hi>Alcove Chamber</hi> and
<hi>Dutchesses Closet,</hi> &amp;c. will deserve a large Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but leaving these Noble Apartments, I shall
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:59888:155"/>
next proceed to tell your Ladyship, That adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to these Lodgings is a great Window, that
gave us a view of a <hi>Private Garden of Pleasure,</hi> I
think finer than the <hi>Privy-Garden</hi> in <hi>White-hall,</hi> or
any Walk I had ever seen: Being hugely pleased
with this <hi>pleasant Prospect,</hi> the Doctor had me up
one pair of Stairs, where on the left hand was the
Room where the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> Dines; <hi>'twas
high Roof d, very large, and hung all round with
Gilded Leather;</hi> the Table-Cloth was laying as
we enterd the Room; and I do think the curious
foldings of the Damask Napkins, and pretty Nick
Nacks that adorn'd the Table (had I time) were
worth a particular Description; and the <hi>Plate for
the Dinner</hi> was not less remarkable; there were
Three Silver Tankards embellish'd with curious
Figures, and so very large, that I believe, wou'd
his <hi>Grace</hi> have given me one of 'em, I cou'd scarce
have dragg'd it to my Lodging; there were two
Silver <hi>Salvers,</hi> as large and noble, and a <hi>Voider</hi>
made of Silver, big enough to contain all, as I
perceiv'd it did. Leaving this <hi>Noble Dineing-room,
(for what's Dinner or Plate either, to a Man that
has no right to't</hi>) we ascended two pair of Stairs,
which brought us into a <hi>Noble Gallery,</hi> which, for
length, variety of gilded Chairs, and the <hi>curious
Pictures</hi> that adorn it, has no equal in the Three
Kingdoms, and perhaps not in <hi>Europe;</hi> so that
this <hi>Castle</hi> may properly be called the <hi>Elisium of
Ireland:</hi> And were not the <hi>Duke</hi> and <hi>Dutchess</hi> bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
principled than to forget Heaven for the sake
of a perishing Glory, they'd little think of Mansi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
heteafter, who have such a <hi>Paradise</hi> at present
to live in. But to return to the Description of this
<hi>Noble Gallery:</hi> The first thing I saw remarkable in
it (and indeed the <hi>Top-Glory</hi> of all the rest) was
the Picture of the <hi>Dutchess of Ormond;</hi> the Face
was finish'd, but the other parts wanted more of the
<hi>Painter</hi>'s <hi>Art;</hi> but I must say that of her <hi>Grace's
Picture,</hi> that were all the Beauties in the World
lost, it might be found again in this <hi>Painted Face;</hi>
tho' that too, is as much out-done by theOrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:59888:156"/>
as a real Flame exceeds that of a painted one.
There is also a design of drawing the <hi>Dukes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>icture,</hi>
and when both are finish'd, Dr. Wood told me they
are design'd to adorn the <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lsel</hi> (a sort of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change;</hi>)
to which will be added the Pictures of
all those that have been <hi>Mayors of Kilkenny.</hi> The
next Picture I saw remark <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, was the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
frowning (like a meer <hi>Nero</hi>) on the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
that brought him ill News from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
By him hung the <hi>Dutchess of Modena's</hi> Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
(late Queen of <hi>England;</hi>) and next to her
stands the late King <hi>Iames,</hi> drawn like a Man
afrighted; so that I told the Doctor, I judg'd the
Painter design'd to draw him just as he look'd when
he <hi>fled from the Boyn.</hi> Near King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Picture
hangs the Picture of <hi>an old Vsurer,</hi> telling Money,
and a <hi>Iew</hi> by him, which (considering the <hi>Moral</hi>
of it) is pretty enough to behold.</p>
                  <p>Here is also the Picture of that chaste Prince,
<hi>Charles</hi> 1. who (if you'll take his word on the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold)
<hi>ne'er straid from his Queen, in Thought, Word,
or Deed;</hi> and next to him (if I don't mistake)
hangs H—that lustful Queen: Here is also the
Picture of <hi>Charles the Second,</hi> that <hi>Royal Libertine;</hi>
but the <hi>Queen Dowager</hi> I did not see. There were
great variety of other Pictures, but I reserve the
rest for my <hi>Summer Ramble.</hi> But (Madam) I
can't forbear telling ye at present, That at the West
end of the Gallery, stood the <hi>several Ages of Man,</hi>
perhaps the finest draught that the World has seen.
On the left side of the Room hangs the Picture of
<hi>Vandike,</hi> as drawn by himself; (and a curious thing
it is) and a little below him is a <hi>Scotch</hi> Lord, drawn
in that Garb he hunts, or goes to visit the <hi>Clanns.</hi>
And I must not forget to tell ye, that on the South
side of the Gallery, hangs two <hi>Royal Buds, Charles
the Second,</hi> drawn when he was four years old;
(<hi>Ah Charles! What Innocence didst thou out-live?</hi>)
and <hi>Iames the Second,</hi> in hanging-sleeves; and it had
been well for <hi>England,</hi> and himself too, if he had
put off his Body with his little Coat, and so <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chang'd
one Heaven for another.</hi> I shou'd next pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:59888:156"/>
to describe the Pictures of the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>'s
Family, for in this Gallery, and in <hi>Dunmors
House,</hi> (which I'll describe in my <hi>Summer Ramble</hi>)
hang all the Progenitors of this Noble Duke; but
to mention these in that manner I ought, wou'd
require an Age. So (Madam) I must lead you out
of the Gallery <hi>(tho' with a sad Heart, to leave such
a pleasant Place</hi>) and next describe the Bowling-Green
adjoyning to this Princely Seat; <hi>'tis an exact
Square, and fine enough for a Duke to bowl on;</hi> nay,
Church and State were here at <hi>Rub, rub, rub, and a
good cast;</hi> for when the Dr. and I come to the
Green, the Duke was then ftinging the first Bowl;
next troul'd the Bishop of—Collonel R—with
about <hi>four inferior Clergy;</hi> at paying our <hi>Bows
to the Duke,</hi> he gave us the honour of his Hat in a
very obliging manner; and
here I'd attempt his <hi>Grace</hi>'s
<hi>Character,</hi> had not the Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
<hi>Cibbers</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">In his Poem pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd at the Duke'<hi>s</hi> landing in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                     </note> done it before
me; but I may venture to
add to what he has said in the Duke's Praise, <hi>That
the most he has said of him, is the least of what he
merits; for the Duke is a Man of a truly brave and
noble Spirit, and lives in the World like one that is
much above it,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After making our <hi>Devoirs to the Duke,</hi> the Dr. and
I left the <hi>Bowling-Green,</hi> and went next to see the
<hi>Garden</hi> adjoyning to the <hi>Castle,</hi> which (tho' gone to
decay) is now repairing by a <hi>young Gardener from
England,</hi> and will in few years be as pleasant as
the <hi>Spring-Garden</hi> near <hi>Fox-hall.</hi> Having seen what
Rarities the <hi>Castle, Garden,</hi> and <hi>Town</hi> afforded, the
Dr. and I parted o'er a <hi>Glas of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>laret;</hi> and in the
Afternoon, I rambled to <hi>Dunmore</hi> (another Seat of
the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi>'s) and is the finest House in
<hi>Ireland:</hi> On some of the Floors of this House, I
told Twenty Four Rooms; the Stair-case that leads
to 'em, is hung with curious Landskips, and is so
very large, that Twenty Men might walk abreast;
had the House but another Branch, it wou'd be a
perfect H. but without this <hi>additional Beauty,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:59888:157"/>
it may boast of more Rooms than are to be
found in some whole <hi>Towns:</hi> Leaving this <hi>Noble
Seat,</hi> (after <hi>Peggy Corkran</hi> had shew'd me all the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
in it) I return'd that Night to <hi>Kilkenny;</hi>
and from thence, the following Monday, took a
<hi>New Ramble</hi> to view the <hi>Boyn,</hi> and the antient <hi>Town
of Droheda;</hi> and whither I went afterwards, you
shall know in my <hi>Summer Ramble.</hi> But Madam,
I ask your Pardon, for I was going to leave <hi>Kilken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
before I had told ye of the chief Raritie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> said to
be in it; which are, that in this Town there is
<q>
                        <l>Fire without Smoke,</l>
                        <l>Water without Mud,</l>
                        <l>Air without Fogg.</l>
                     </q>
I search'd into this Report, and found it a <hi>real Truth;</hi>
and that the <hi>Fourth Element, of Earth,</hi> was also as
pure.</p>
                  <p>I wou'd here describe the Town of <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> and
give a particular Character of Mr. <hi>Mukins,</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Mayor, of Mr. <hi>Philips,</hi> the Mayor Elect, the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder,
Aldermen, and Common Council-men,</hi> and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other remarkable things and Persons in this
Place: I wou'd also mention the <hi>odd Adventure</hi> of
a Lieutenant that travelled with me to <hi>Kilkenny;</hi>
neither wou'd I omit to give you the heads of a
<hi>remarkable Sermon</hi> I heard in St. <hi>Kenny</hi> Church,
where an Eminent Prelate told us, <hi>That look into
all Divisions of Religion, as those of</hi> Rome <hi>and</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,
<hi>&amp;c. and you'll find (as they are against Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy)
that they have left the good Manners to the poor
Church of England.</hi> Madam, I humbly conceive this
Passage will deserve Remarks (by a better Pen than
mine) as will several other <hi>not able strokes</hi> this good
Bishop entertain'd his Auditory with; but tho' they
are noted down in my <hi>Iournal,</hi> yet I reserve the rest
for my <hi>Summer Ramble,</hi> lest they make my Letter

                  <p>So (Madam) at present I take <hi>my leave of Kilken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
with only telling ye that Morning I left it,
Dr. <hi>Wood</hi> writ an Answer to the Letter I brought

                  <p>Thus (Madam) you see, by taking notice of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
Gardens, Antiquities, Pictures, Publick Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks,
the Rarities in Nature,</hi> and the Civility I
meet in my <hi>generous Friends,</hi> that (<hi>where e're I

neither do I in such <hi>Rambles</hi> omit any thing
that may <hi>instruct or delight me;</hi> and am much

meet with any Allay to my Pleasures by the <hi>dulness
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:59888:158"/>
or decay of my Senses,</hi> for I found them all in their

Stomach, which made me eat even courser fare
with a better Appetite, tho' I saw little of that
here, for the <hi>Kilkenny</hi> Claret is the best in <hi>Ireland;</hi>
and the Doctor's Treats were still rich and noble.</p>
                  <p>Madam, having said so much of Dr. <hi>Wood</hi>'s Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities
to me, perhaps you'll expect I shou'd send
you the Doctor's <hi>Character;</hi> which I'll do, and his
<hi>Ladies</hi> too, that you may see how happy I was in
their <hi>Conversation;</hi> 
                     <q>Dr. <hi>Wood,</hi> like

                        <hi>is the beloved
Physician in these Parts;</hi> and he
really Merits that great Respect which the People
give him; he's a <hi>compleat Gentleman;</hi> very kind
to Strangers, and obliging to the last degree; and
I do think (if I may believe my Eyes) He's the
happiest Man (except my self) that ever entred
into a married State. Madam, I own a kind Wife
often makes an obliging Husband of one that wou'd
otherwise be very indifferent; but this is not the
Doctor's case; for he's a Man of that <hi>sweet Temper,</hi>
that the worst of Wives wou'd be kind to him;
but he has met with one of the best; <hi>Then how
happy is this Couple, that seem to rival one another
in Kindness?</hi>
                     </q> This, Madam, will raise your Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity

Madam, having dedicated this Poem to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of this great and generous Man (whose Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
we liv'd upon) I proceed to acquaint ye, we
had also in Company, a <hi>French Major,</hi> a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of good Sense, but a little passionate.</p>
                  <p>Our third Companion was <hi>Iohny Ferguson,</hi> a very
pleasant Fellow, and one that did great Feats at
the <hi>Boyn.</hi> These three (with my self) were all the
Men that were in the Coach; but we were not
without a She-Companion, I mean the vertuous
Mrs. <hi>Hawksworth,</hi> who may pass for a Wit; and
if ever I go to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> it shall be on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to visit her Ingenious Son; and I must say, if
he takes after his Mother, he'll scarce meet his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
tho' he shou'd girdle the World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Time in such Company flew too fast,</hi> and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to wish the way to <hi>Dublin</hi> had been much
longer. In our way home, we had debates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Spider's Webb, The curious work in a
Turtles Nest, The Government of Bees, The love of a
Spaniel-Dog to his Master,</hi> and upon other Subjects;
but I wave them here, designing all our <hi>Disputes
in the Coach</hi> shall be part of my <hi>Summer Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I was no sooner come home, and had given <hi>some
necessary Orders about my Auction,</hi> but I rambled to
<hi>Drogheda,</hi> and paid a Visit to the <hi>famous Boyn,</hi> so
memorable for the Victory King <hi>VVilliam</hi> there ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
over the <hi>Irish,</hi> tho' they were Five to One;
and that nothing might 'scape my View, that was

                  <p>That Morning I rid to <hi>Drogheda,</hi> the Air was sweet
and kind, the Fields were <hi>Trim and Neat,</hi> the Sun
benign and cherishing, and from ev'ry thing I met,
I receiv'd a <hi>Civility;</hi> and which added still to my Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
I went in Company with the <hi>Minister of the
Newry:</hi> 
                     <q>He's a Divine of great Learning and
Worth, speaks admirably, and <hi>inspired a Soul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all our Company;</hi>
                     </q> and in my <hi>Summer Ramble</hi> I'll
attempt his Character at large. He treated me that
Night with a noble Supper; not for any thing he
found in me, but (as he express'd it) for the sake
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:59888:160"/>
of my being the <hi>Son of a Clergy-man:</hi> When I had
taken leave of this Generous Parson, I went to lodge
with one Mr. <hi>Watson,</hi> an Apothecary in <hi>Drogheda;</hi>
I was hugely pleas'd with my <hi>new Quarters,</hi> for my
Landlady (tho' <hi>a Roman Catholick</hi>) was a very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging,
generous Woman; and for Mr. <hi>Watson,</hi> I
don't think there's an honester Man in <hi>Drogheda;</hi> I
found him excellent Company, and a very ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Man: <q>His Wit is ductile and pliable to all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
(as well as to that of the Glister-pipe)
from <hi>a Pin to a Pillar,</hi> nothing was so small but
his Skill cou'd work; nothing so great, but his
Industry cou'd Atchieve:</q> After I had convers'd a
while with my new Landlord, I went to Alderman
<hi>Iackson</hi>'s to deliver Mr. <hi>Wild's</hi> Letter; before I came
to <hi>Drogheda,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wild</hi> told me what a courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Person Mr. <hi>Iackson</hi> was; and when I came
to his Father's House, <q>He receiv'd me in such
an obliging Manner, that his Favours did transcend
Report, as much as they exceeded my Desert.
Madam, this Gentleman <hi>resolves to live a Batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,</hi>
which I cou'd not but wonder at; for doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Nature meant him a Conqueror over all hearts,
when she gave him such <hi>Sense,</hi> and such <hi>Beauty:</hi>
(for he's a very handsome Man:) His Wit sparkles
as well as his Eyes; and his Discourse charms as
well as his Beauty; <hi>and I found by a little talking
with him,</hi> that his Mind is none of those narrow
ones, who know one thing, and are ignorant of
a thousand; but on the contrary, it is so very
large, that altho' it cannot be said <hi>Iackson knew
euery thing equally well,</hi> yet it is most certain, he
can give an excellent <hi>Account of all things;</hi> but
tho' his Soul is enrich'd with every Vertue, yet I
thought the most remarkable thing in him, was
his <hi>great Humility,</hi> and readiness to serve a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
(for I might pass as such, having never seen
him, but a <hi>minute or two</hi> in <hi>London.</hi>)</q> Madam,
<hi>meeting with such a Friend as this,</hi> you may well
think I cou'd never enough enjoy him; so leaving
his <hi>Father</hi>'s <hi>House,</hi> we went together to a Place
in <hi>Drogheda,</hi> where we fell into Company with
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:59888:160"/>
several Gentlemen, and particularly with Mr. <hi>Single<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi>
                     <q>
                        <hi>He's a young Sprigg of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and might have stay'd at</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">2 Sam. 10. 15.</note> Jericho <hi>till his Beard was
grown;</hi>
                     </q> but when he speaks, 'tis off hand (as they
call it here) so that Nature seems to have made
a Present to him, of whatever a long Study and
Meditation gives out by degrees to others: He
preach'd in <hi>Drogheda</hi> Church up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Text. <hi>And</hi>

and I think 'twas the most ingenious Sermon I ever
heard. But my Design here is only to hint at
things; so I leave this <hi>young Divine,</hi> that I
may come to acknowledge the generous Treatment
I met in <hi>Drogheda,</hi> from Mr. <hi>Kelsey</hi> (for I don't
forget the Token he sent by me to his Friend,
Sir <hi>Thomas Montgomery.</hi>) This Gentleman has a
great deal of Wit, and (which is rare in witty Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)
is Mast<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r over himself; walks according to the
Rules of Vertue, <hi>as the hours pass by the degrees of
the Sun;</hi> and being made of good humor, his Life
is a perpetual Harmony; and by consequence
is a great Blessing to his Wife and Children, if he
has any. After Mr. <hi>Kelsey</hi> had given me a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Relation of the <hi>Boyn</hi> Fight, and we had drank
a Health to his Friend in <hi>England,</hi> Mr. <hi>Iackson</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
me to visit the <hi>famous Walker</hi> (the ingenious
Translater of <hi>Epictetus.</hi>) <q>
                        <hi>He's an universal Scholar;
and I do believe, were all the Learning in</hi> Ireland
<hi>lost, it might be found again in this worthy Person;</hi>
and he's as Pious as he's Learned: He prefers <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi>
before Riches, <hi>Vertue</hi> above Honour; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth
not to be <hi>Great, but to do good;</hi> and is so
very exact in all he says, that his words are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
of Wisdom.</q> When we came to this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
House, his Scholars were acting <hi>Henry</hi> IV. and
a Latin Play out of <hi>Terence;</hi> they were all Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Lads, and perform'd their parts to a wonder;
but one <hi>Ellwood</hi> (who acted <hi>Falstaffe</hi>) bore away
the Bell from the whole School. But <hi>Thieves!
Thieves!</hi> (but no wonder, for I'm still in <hi>Ireland)</hi>
                     <pb n="384" facs="tcp:59888:161"/>
for I had no sooner left Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s School, but I
lost my <hi>Cane,</hi> and a <hi>Silver Box.</hi> But (Madam)
as Thievish as <hi>Drogheda</hi> is, I can't but <hi>think with
pleasure of</hi> Ireland, <hi>as 'twas there I had the honour to
be first known to your Ladyship.</hi> But more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I love <hi>Drogheda;</hi> where, for two days, the <hi>Tears
I shed for the matchless D—ne,</hi> wou'd not suffer
me to walk abroad. Madam, 'twas here your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
was so very seasonable, and went so far <hi>towards
drying up all my Tears.</hi> But tho' I've reason to love
<hi>Drogheda,</hi> as 'twas the Town where I gri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ev'd so
much for <hi>D—ne;</hi> and as 'twas here I was blest with
your kind <hi>Correction</hi> for my weeping more than
became me; yet after all, <hi>Drogheda is a Thievish
Place;</hi> and had I but stay'd a Week in it (as I
cou'd scarce forbear, <hi>Iackson,</hi> and <hi>Kelsy</hi> were so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging)
I had surely been reduc'd to <hi>Primitive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence;</hi>
so I left <hi>Drogheda</hi> in a sort of fright, after
I had seen the Mayor (who is so clear in his Trust,
that his Vertues shine to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and from thence
to <hi>London</hi>) the Aldermen, the Primates House, and
the Mount that gave me a sight of the <hi>Boyn,</hi> that
fatal place to the Popish Army. So Dear <hi>Iackson</hi>
farewell, till I see thee again in <hi>London;</hi> where thou
shalt be (tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> not so nobly treated, yet) as wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
to me, as I was to you in <hi>Drogheda.</hi> And
(Madam) the Truth is, he that confers on me Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
so generously as Mr. <hi>Iackson</hi> did, <hi>steals me from
my self,</hi> and in one and the same Act, makes me <hi>his
Vassal, and himself my King.</hi> When I receive a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
from any Man, till I have repaid it, my Mind
(as <hi>Feltham</hi> says) is a <hi>Prisoner; and till a Ransom be
paid by a like return, I'm kept in Fetters, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
to love, to serve, and to be ready, as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror
desires it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Madam, I stay'd but three days in <hi>Drogheda,</hi> and
am now return'd to <hi>Dublin,</hi> where I hear from
<hi>England</hi> the sad News of the <hi>death of my Owl</hi> ('tis
the <hi>Bird of Athens</hi>) and has been peering for Mice
in my <hi>House and Garden</hi> for three years; so out of
meer love to this <hi>old Servant,</hi> I fell to write an <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say
in Praise of an Owl,</hi> and have spent about twenty
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:59888:161"/>
sheets in telling the Vertues of poor <hi>Madge.</hi> A
Learned Author writ in Praise of <hi>Barrenness;</hi> the
Great <hi>Erasmus</hi> writ in Praise of <hi>Folly,</hi> and a late
Writer has wasted a great deal of Paper in Praise of
a <hi>Cows-Tail;</hi> and I cou'd not see why I might not
follow such Examples, and endeavour to Praise my
<hi>Owl.</hi> I confess Madam, this Subject is not <hi>grave
enough</hi> for your perusal; or if it was, I'd write an
<hi>Elegy on poor Madge, and send that and his Character</hi>
for your Reflections; but this is a <hi>hint by the by,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will I presume to be thus <hi>merry</hi> without your
leave. But (Madam) I had scarce finish'd my <hi>Owls
Character</hi> (which wou'd take up a Month to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
fair) but my old <hi>rambling Maggot</hi> began to
crawl, and bite afresh; upon which I immediately
grew as fickle and wavering, as if I had drank <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
distill'd from a Womans Brains;</hi> and nothing
wou'd satisfie me now, till I was on another Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and the next I took was to <hi>Ballimany,</hi> to see
the <hi>Curragh,</hi> and the running for the King's <hi>Plate.</hi>
Madam, by this speedy <hi>Rambling</hi> again, you see the
toyl of keeping Accounts, was a Labour too tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
for my Mercurial Brains.</p>
                  <p>Being now resolv'd for a new Adventure, on <hi>Tues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
September</hi> 11. I took a Coach to one <hi>Gents,</hi> a
Mile out of Town, where my Horse waited for me;
and here my Stars threw me upon good Company;
(one of which they call'd <hi>Climene;</hi>) we set out for
<hi>Ballimany</hi> with the early Sun, yet we had his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
but a little while; for just as we had his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
but a little while; for just as we got to the
<hi>Fox</hi> and <hi>Geese</hi> ('tis a House your Ladyship has
heard me speak of) he withdrew into an <hi>Apartment
behind a Cloud,</hi> so that the day now grew very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant;
but our Company was so agreeable, that
<hi>bad Weather</hi> was little minded.</p>
                  <p>As soon as we had left the <hi>Fox and Geese, Clime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi>
gave us a pleasant Account of the silly raving of
<hi>a certain Female,</hi> whose Character expect in my
<hi>Summer Ramble:</hi> This <hi>Relation</hi> occasion'd a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
about <hi>scolding Wives,</hi> and <hi>Dueking-stools,</hi>
which lasted till we came to <hi>Racool,</hi> where we
treated <hi>Climene</hi> with a Bottle of Cyder (<hi>for we all
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:59888:162"/>
thought a Pot in our Pate was a Mile in our way;</hi>)
having refreshed our selves in this little Town, on
we rambled for <hi>Ballimany,</hi> diverting our selves on
the Road with what we had seen and heard in <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin;</hi>
and at last we fell to discourse of <hi>Innocence,</hi>
and the <hi>great Chastity of the brave Lucretia;</hi> we had
no sooner entered on this Discourse, but a <hi>sure Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem
of Chastity</hi> (an old man of forescore) limps
out of his little House (which I'm sure he might
carry on his Back) to begg our <hi>Charity;</hi> not (Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam)
<hi>but we had Charity,</hi> but having no Pence
about us, we dismiss'd this <hi>venerable Beggar</hi> with
a promise of being kind as we came back.</p>
                  <p>The next <hi>Spectacle</hi> we were entertain'd with, was
the <hi>Sign of a Church;</hi> I call it so, for 'twas only a
<hi>Steeple</hi> standing like a May-pole, without any Prop,
but a tall Pillar, and which to us (at a great dist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance)
seemed little bigger than the Spire it sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported;
we cou'd not but wonder at the humor of
these People, that they shou'd fancy only a Steeple
without the necessary Appartenance of <hi>Vestry, Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,
or Chancel?</hi> but the next Person we met, told
us, 'twas not the fault of the Parish, but plainly
the Devils Malice to the <hi>Preaching of God's Word;</hi>
for as fast as the Building went on by day, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
carry'd it away by night. I then asked, Why
the <hi>Steeple</hi> had better luck than the other parts of
the Church? To this he reply'd, that the Parish
formerly had been <hi>very wicked;</hi> and that Heaven
permitted the Steeple shou'd be left standing, to
upbraid the Inhabitants. Madam, if what this
Fellow said was true (for we thought it a piece of
banter,) this Steeple is high enough to be a warning

                  <p>Being hugely pleas'd with this Fellows Answer,
we jogg'd on to the <hi>Naas;</hi> we had here staid for a
Dinner, cou'd we ha' perswaded our selves to have
lost the sight of a diverting Passage then in view;
'twas a <hi>brace of dear Ioys,</hi> that had tyed two loaded
Horses to an old Hedge, whilst they formally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strip,
and without Fear, or Wit, fall to lousing
'emselves; <hi>Climene,</hi> who cou'd be Witty when,

and on whom she pleas'd, bid 'em be careful that
they did not <hi>over-stock the Ground.</hi>

these being common in <hi>Ireland,</hi> we left the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of this <hi>Adventure,</hi> to discourse of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
then in sight; for now, let us turn to the
right, or the left hand, we had a <hi>charming View of
the Country;</hi> not but a sight of <hi>Climene</hi> was beyond
all we saw (for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

variety sake) we wou'd now and then look about
us.</p>
                  <p>Madam, being now come to the <hi>Lissee</hi> (which
all pass that go to the <hi>Curragh,</hi>) that River was
swell'd so high, that poor <hi>Leander</hi> (as one in our
Company call'd himself) was forc'd to
cross it with his<note n="*" place="margin">Climene.</note> 
                     <hi>Hero</hi> behind him. I
don't know what Information <hi>Climene</hi>
receiv'd from her Friend <hi>Leander,</hi> but she was
pleas'd to tell me, she understood I had a mighty
<hi>passion for my first Wife,</hi> and that she was a Person
deserv'd it; she then enquir'd, <hi>Whether I lov'd any
before her?</hi> I told her I did. She then asked, Who
the Person was? I told her 'twas one <hi>Rachel</hi>—who
was so very Beautiful, that a <hi>Venus</hi> might
have been form'd out of her Person; and yet her
Wit did far exceed her Beauty. Having said so
much, <hi>Climene</hi> ask'd me a hundred Questions about
<hi>Rachel;</hi> as, Whether she was Rich? <hi>What were her
Parents?</hi> How we came to part? And whether I
continued to love her after I Marry'd <hi>Eliza?</hi> I told
her I did not; but cou'd not but own I took a
mighty Pleasure in <hi>Rachel</hi>'s Company before I knew
<hi>Eliza</hi> (tho' after I knew her, I scarce loved any
thing else;) and because <hi>Rachel</hi> admir'd <hi>Poetry,</hi> I
made my Courtship to the <hi>Muses</hi> too, that I might
be the more grateful to her; and, Madam (can ye
believe it,) I had the good fortune to write some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in <hi>Rachel</hi>'s Praise, which met with a kind
Reception; I first presented 'em to her (and she
being tickl'd with my Commendations) shew'd
'em to her Scotch Friends, and others; for <hi>Clara</hi>
now (for so I call'd her,) pretended to out-doe me
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:59888:163"/>
in Tenderness. But (Madam) these <hi>Poetick Essays</hi>
had an effect different from what I intended; for
I design'd by 'em, only to make <hi>my own Addresses</hi>
to her the more acceptable; but she, by shewing
'em abroad, got the name of a Wit (and having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
a Reputation beyond what she had before,)
began to value her self at a <hi>higher Rate,</hi> and to treat
me with Disdain; I won't so blind with gazing on
her Face, or <hi>charm'd so much with her Witty Letters,</hi>
but I cou'd see with <hi>what Contempt</hi> she treated me;
and seeing, cou'd not but resent it to that degree,
that I thought it my <hi>Duty to humble</hi> her; and in
order to it, I sent her the following Lines;</p>

How <hi>Clara</hi> resented this Poem, I never ask'd,
for her Pride had given me enough of her (<hi>Pride
was never yet found in a noble Nature, or Humility
in an unworthy Mind,</hi>) and so I left her; and I appeal
to you, Madam, Whether I had not reason to slight
her? As for <hi>Climene</hi> (my Fellow Traveller) she
gave her Judgment in my Favour; and (Madam)
I want to know whose part you'll take; fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> this is
the Wit I so often mention'd to <hi>D—ne;</hi> and
'tis your Judgment (alone) that can determine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I did well or ill.</p>
                  <p>As we <hi>walked along, Leander</hi> wou'd now and
then put in a word against <hi>Clara's</hi> Inconstancy; but
<hi>Wells</hi> (another of our Fellow Travellers) cou'd not
hear the Story without <hi>railing at the whole Sex;</hi>
upon which <hi>Climene</hi> banter'd 'em both. This urg'd
'em again to ask <hi>Climene,</hi> How many <hi>whineing,
Slaves</hi> she had murder'd her self (for she was very
handsom, and very Witty) but (Madam) neither
<hi>Climene,</hi> nor any of the Company, wou'd come to
<hi>Confession.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In such Discourses as these, we pass'd away the
melancholly day, 'till we came to <hi>Ballimany</hi> (our
intended Quarters.) 'Tis a small <hi>Village of poor Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins,</hi>
and an old Castle, of which there is abundance
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> built, it is said, by the <hi>Danes,</hi> long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the coming of the <hi>English</hi> into it; they are
square strong Buildings of Stone, with a small
Door, and stone Stairs, and Windows like Spike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holes,
purposely for strength; for as the <hi>Danes</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
their Frontiers, they built these Castles on
them as curbs to the Neighbouring <hi>Irish.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Madam, I have often had occasion in some of my
Letters, to mention these <hi>Cabbins,</hi> or Huts, but now
take the description of them; <q>They build them
by putting two forked sticks of such length as
they intend the height of the Building, and at
such distance as they design its length; if they
design it large, they place three or four such forks
into the Ground, and on them they lay other
long sticks, which are the ridge Timber; then
they rais the Wall, which they make of Clay
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:59888:164"/>
and Straw temper'd with Water, and this they
call Mudd; when the Wall is raised to a sufficient
height, which perhaps is four foot, then they lay
other small sticks, with one end on the ridge
piece, and the other on the Wall; these they
<hi>wattle with small hazels,</hi> and then cover them with
straw, or course Grass, without any Chimneys;
so that when the Fire is lighted, the smoak will
come through the Thatch, so that you would
think the <hi>Cabbin</hi> were on fire: Another sort of
their Cabbins is made by laying one end of the
stick upon the bank of a Ditch, and the other up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a little bit of a mudd Wall; and then, when
'tis wattled, they cover it with Heath-straw, or
scraws of Earth; and <hi>into this miserable Place will
half a dozen poor Creatures creep for shelter and
Lodging;</hi> but their Beds are upon such a firm
Foundation, that nothing but an <hi>Earthquake</hi> can
move them: Instead of <hi>Feathers</hi> or <hi>Flocks,</hi> they
they use <hi>Rushes</hi> or <hi>Straw,</hi> which serves them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
changing. <hi>Sheets</hi> they never provide, and to
tell the <hi>naked Truth,</hi> unless they can purchase a
poor <hi>Cadow,</hi> which is not often, they <hi>ligg</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
like <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> before the <hi>Fall,</hi> not a <hi>Rag</hi>
to cover them, but themselves; which may be one
reason why they so multiply; each little Hut be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
full of Children. They seldom have any <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions</hi>
or several Rooms; but sleep in common
with their <hi>Swine</hi> and <hi>Poultrey;</hi> and for second
or third <hi>Story,</hi> you may look long enough e're
you find any. But as the Building of <hi>Versailes</hi>
are so very Magnificent, as not capable of such
a description that may give a just Idea of them;
so these, in <hi>the other extream,</hi> are so very wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
things, that perhaps the Pen of the noblest
Architect wou'd be very defective in describing
them. Behind one of their Cabbins lyes the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
a piece of Ground sometimes of half an
Acre, or an Acre, and in this is the Turf-stack,
their Corn, perhaps two or three hundred sheaves
of Oats, and as much Pease, the rest of the Ground
is full of their dearly beloved Potatoes, and a
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:59888:164"/>
few Cabbages, which the <hi>solitary Calf of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that is here pent from its Dam, never suffers to
come to Perfection.</hi>
                     </q> Madam, I shou'd more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly

was there.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed in my <hi>Rambles:</hi> Next Morning
early, without regarding any Ceremony, we made
our Visit to a <hi>Popish Father,</hi> who was just up, and
wiping his Eyes; the Weather was very fair, and
we stay'd at the door (<hi>which had a little green Field
before it</hi>) until the Room within was swept to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
us; <hi>the Dew lay in pretty Spangles on the Grass,
made by refraction of the Sun Beams:</hi> I had a mind
to try the Father's Philosophy, and enquired <hi>what
the Dew was?</hi> He told me, <hi>'Twas a Wapor that fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Ground in the Night Sheason,</hi> and that the
Sun drawed it up again in the Day; but <hi>Climene</hi>
told him it was an old and vulgar Notion, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded

Opinion, <hi>it might be either the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

swore by St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Hand, <hi>she was as Witty as she
was Pretty;</hi> and put some other Complements on
her, <hi>the best of which were much beneath what she
truly deserves.</hi> The House was now ready, and the
Maid came to call us in, where we broke our Fast,
and prevailed with Father <hi>A</hi>—to accompany us

Heath; it is said to be five and twenty Miles round;
this is the</hi> New-Market <hi>of</hi> Ireland, <hi>where the Horse-Races
are run, and also Hunting Matches made,

taken from the Story of <hi>Dido</hi>'s purchasing so much
Ground as she could surround with an Ox-hide, on
which she built <hi>Carthage</hi>) That St. <hi>Bridget,</hi> the
great Saint of <hi>Kildare,</hi> begg'd as much Land from
one of the <hi>Irish Kings,</hi> for a common Pasture, as
she could environ with her <hi>Frize Mantle;</hi> the
Prince laugh'd at her, and bid her take it; she
cut her Mantle into so many small shreds, as
when tack'd together by their ends, surrounded all
this <hi>Curragh</hi> or <hi>Downs.</hi>

                     <hi>Kildare</hi> is an ordinary Country-Town, not near
so good as the <hi>Naas,</hi> though it gives a Name to the
County, and is an Episcopal see, tho' but of small
Revenues; and is now therefore united to the
<hi>Deanry of Christ-Church,</hi> which is the King's Royal
Chappel in <hi>Dublin,</hi> as the <hi>Bishoprick of Rochester</hi> is

and a <hi>weekly Market,</hi> and sends two Burgesses to
the Parliament; yet after all, it is but a <hi>poor Place,</hi>
not lying in any Road, and not having any Trade
belonging to it; there are some shops with Hops,
Iron, Salt, and Tobacco, and the Merchant not
worth Forty Pound. This County gives the Title

and with some Bottles of Wine, made our selves
merry; when we took Horse our Landlord told
us we must accept of <hi>a Dugh-a-Durras</hi> from him,
which is a drink at the door; he had a Bottle of
Brandy under his Arm, and a little wooden Cup,
with which he presented each of us a Dram; from
hence we went about two Miles backward towards
the Kings Country, to view the Earl of <hi>Kildare</hi>'s
Chair; It is an old Castle built on the side of an

Hill, which <hi>over-looks all the Neighbouring Country</hi>
I was told it was built by some of the Earls of <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dare,</hi>
as a Watch Tower, for which purpose it was
very well plac'd.</p>
                  <p>From hence we had a <hi>lovely Prospect</hi> towards the
North, of a noble Vale, part of which was cover'd
with Corn, and part with Cattle, with some Woods;
among which were seen some Houses of good bulk
and shew, raising their Heads; beyond these were
Hills, on which stood several great Houses, a <hi>fine

which indeed is a <hi>noble Plain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After we had <hi>satisfied our Eyes with staring about,</hi>
we steered our Course towards the <hi>Bogg of Allen;</hi>
which, tho' it be the greatest in <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet never
was so famous as in the last Rebellion, where the
<hi>Rapparees</hi> (who are a loose undisciplin'd People) had
their Rendezvous when they design'd any Mischief
on the Country, to the number of five or six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
and where they easily hid themselves when
pursu'd; for as I am inform'd, <hi>this Bogg is near
fifty Miles long,</hi> with many Woods in it, and some
Islands of very good and profitable Land; as the
Island of <hi>Allea,</hi> which they say is worth eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

out of his Treasury here, to buy a Plate,
which they run for at the <hi>Curragh</hi> in <hi>September;</hi>
the Horses that run, are to carry twelve Stone each;
and therefore there are several fine Horses kept here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts

There is another Race yearly ran here, in <hi>March</hi>

                  <p>Madam, on <hi>Thursday</hi> the 13<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> was
the day of the Race this Year for the King's-Plate.
There was a vast concourse of People to see it, from
all parts of the Kingdom. My Lord <hi>Galway</hi> (one
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:59888:166"/>
of the <hi>Lords Iustices</hi>) was present at the Race, and
other Persons of great Quality. I met on the <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragh</hi>
(where the Race was run) with my worthy
Friend, Mr. <hi>Searl,</hi> whose Character you have in my
<hi>Dublin</hi> Farewel, and several others that I knew in
<hi>Dublin;</hi> after the Race was over, our Company
rid to <hi>Ballimany;</hi> at this Village is a little thatch'd
House, like one of our English Country Houses,
built by the Earl of <hi>Meath,</hi> After we had seen all
the Rooms in this <hi>Noble Man's thatcht House</hi> (which
I design to describe in my <hi>Summer Ramble</hi>) we
left <hi>Ballimany,</hi> and did'd that day at the <hi>Naas,</hi> and
reach'd <hi>Dublin</hi> about nine in the Evening.</p>
                  <p>But (Madam) if the Predictions of <hi>Astrologers</hi> be
true, such Men as I am, are <hi>very Mercurial Folks,</hi>
I mean the Planet, not the Mineral: For (Madam)
you that know me, will believe I never had any
great occasion for it; I had not been long in <hi>Dublin</hi>
before the <hi>Itch of Rambling broke out again</hi> upon me,
though I once thought the Fatigue of my <hi>Curragh-Ramble</hi>
would have abated the sharpness of it, as
effectually as <hi>Brimstone and Butter does that in the
Skin;</hi> but what's bread in the Bone, will never out
of the Flesh; and I among the other <hi>Sons of Adam,
am in a literal Sense born to great Travels;</hi> and some
People are surely so much delighted with the <hi>Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of change,</hi> that like other <hi>Epicureans,</hi> they will
purchase the fancied Pleasure through thousands of
Difficulties that attend the acquisition: Not imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
to this, is what I remember to have read in
the celebrated Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> of one who was born blind,
because of the adhesion of her Eye-lids; and her
Parents living far in the Country, from any Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
or Surgeons, thought her Mallady incurable,
until the time she was about <hi>Eighteen years old;</hi>
when, being called to <hi>London</hi> about some business
likely to require a long Attendance, he brought his
blind Daughter, with the rest of his Family, to
Town; where the <hi>Vnion of her Eyelids being sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
by a Surgeon</hi>'s <hi>Lancet,</hi> she immediately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
a <hi>thousand pleasing Objects;</hi> she beheld every
Minute, new things with Admiration; and not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:59888:166"/>
with seeing, as soon as she could conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
go abroad, <hi>she was every day on the Ramble,</hi> as
if she intended to make up for the losses she suffer'd
by her former darkness: and when she became ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the <hi>Objects of the Town,</hi> she begg'd
leave to roam about the Country, not without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of some Inclinations to satisfie her Eyes
with <hi>a view of all the World could afford her.</hi> Of this
Girls Humor my Landlord found me; for now (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
I had setled the Affairs of my Auction) I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
<hi>East, West, North, and South;</hi> and (Madam)
shou'd I tell ye what <hi>Irish Cities, Towns,</hi> and <hi>Villages</hi> I
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ext saw, I shou'd lead you such a <hi>Wild-goose Chase,</hi>
I shou'd tire ye quite, but not my self, for I am
never weary with traveling. But (as much as I love
rambling) I have just now receiv'd a Letter from
<hi>Valeria (crowded with desires to see me</hi>) which
will <hi>shorten my Ramble,</hi> some thousand Miles. I'll
see but <hi>Europe, Asia, Africa, America,</hi> or so, dat
is all, and be in <hi>London</hi> by <hi>Plato</hi>'s year; not but
<hi>I'm a huge lover of Travels,</hi> 
                     <q>and wou'd gladly view
the <hi>Globe Coelestial</hi> too (as I told the ingenious
D—ne) before I return; I mean climb so
high <hi>as to hang my Hat upon one horne of the Moon,
and touch the North Pole with my Middle Finger.</hi>
                     </q>
But (seeing you admire I <hi>ramble thus</hi>) let
me go down from the Moon a little, to tell your
Ladyship, that had you but seen <hi>Italy,</hi> (and those
other Countries I am bound to) you'd rather envy
then pitty my rambling Fate.</p>
                  <p>Alas! Madam, to change my Bed, troubled not
me, for I cou'd sleep contentedly in <hi>America, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Wales, &amp;c.</hi> or in any place; for if I had the
hardest Lodging, I cou'd dream of my <hi>Valeria</hi> with
as much Satisfaction, as if I had been sleeping on a
Bed of Down; and when I awake, I please my
self with thinking that in a little time I shall see
her again: And where-ever I ramble, I'm still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
for there's a <hi>wheel within a wheel,</hi> and nothing
comes to pass by chance.</p>
                  <p>As to my very <hi>Auctions,</hi> if things went <hi>prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously:
there,</hi> I look'd upon it as an effect of Divine
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:59888:167"/>
Favour, and return'd God the Praise; if otherwise,
it put me <hi>on Examining my self,</hi> and humbling of
my Soul before my Maker; and I look on all cross
Accidents as Tryals of my Patience. And indeed,
still upon <hi>self-Reflections,</hi> I rather wonderd that
things went so well, than found my self concern'd
they went no better.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Patrick took my Auction Room over my Head,</hi>
it was for him that I was troubled most; that he
should deal so barbarously with one that never gave
him any cause for't; <hi>I was well satisfy'd in my own
Innocence,</hi> and thought I was concern'd to make
the World so, by letting of 'em know the Truth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
things; and then to leave the issue to that Wise
Providence that best knows how to order all things
for his Glory and my Good.</p>
                  <p>You may suppose perhaps (Madam) there are no
Beggars in <hi>Dublin,</hi> since I have all this while been
so silent, and said nothing of Alms-giving; but as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
your self (Madam) to the contray; for to the
best of my knowledge, I never saw them so thick
any where else, <hi>in the whole course of my Life;</hi> and
how to carry my self in respect to these <hi>Wretches,</hi> has
been a matter which often disturb'd me; <hi>to give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all, is impossible;</hi> for a Man then must be richer
than <hi>Croesus;</hi> and not to give at all, is <hi>Vnchristian;</hi>
but the main Difficulty lies in the right distribution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and to relieve those who are most necessitous; but
who can know this? For I have heard Bishop <hi>Hall</hi>
say (he that was Bishop of <hi>Oxford</hi>) that once
walking through <hi>Moorfields,</hi> a Beggar follow'd him
with great Importunities, and desir'd him <hi>for Christ</hi>'s
<hi>sake to give him something, for he was ready to starve;</hi>
the Bishop (not thinking him a fit Object for
Charity) told him, if he refus'd to give him any
thing, he believ'd he'd Curse him; no, said the Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
indeed Sir I won't; well then, said the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
I'll try thee for once; upon which the Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
fell a <hi>Cursing and Swearing at him like a very
Devil.</hi>—Madam, when I meet with such
vile <hi>Beggars</hi> as these, I serve 'em as the Bishop did;
but I am (Madam) if I don't flatter my self, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:59888:167"/>
Compassionate, easily affected with the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
of other Men in any kind, but much more
when I see old Age go a Begging; and 'tis such that
have been the principal Objects of my Charity; and
next to them, the Blind. I never conceive the
Beggar-man the more necessitous, by being the
more importunate and querilous; and of this sort
no Man, I believe, has been attended with a much
greater Train: Indeed I have heard your old <hi>Eleemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinaries,</hi>
who have been train'd up to the Trade
from their younger years, (as I am satisfy'd many
have been, both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>) can, by
long Experience, and constant Observation, readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
distinguish, even in a Crowd of Men, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate
Face; and will single him out, as I may
say, to be the Object of their Importunities. But
after all, Madam, in matters of the distributions of
Charity, the right hand is not to know what the
left does.</p>
                  <p>And now, Madam, having given you some Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of my <hi>Conversation in Ireland</hi> (both in City
and Country) and also given ye some HINTS of
my several Rambles in it, and <hi>what I observed in
'em.</hi> Perhaps you may think by this time, I have
seen <hi>enough of Ireland,</hi> to be able to give your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyship
<hi>some general Character of it:</hi> I confess, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
I am very bad at Descriptions, but a <hi>general
Character of the Dear Ioys</hi> being what I formerly
promised the ingenious <hi>D—ne,</hi> I shall now send
it to you (her other self) and hope your <hi>Goodness</hi>
will be as willing to pardon all my Mistakes in it,
as hers wou'd ha' been, had she liv'd to have read

The Sun, whose great and generous Influence</l>
                        <l>Does Life and Warmth to ev'ry Place dispence,</l>
                        <l>O'ercome by th' innate Venom of this Air,</l>

                  <p>Perhaps (Madam) you may think I am too <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etical,</hi>
and may expect a more particular Account

                     </gap>m alive.—Then to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to the <hi>Prose-Character of Poor Teague;</hi> and
here I must first acquaint ye, <q>That the Gentleman
<hi>who trip'd lately to Ireland, calls it the Watering-Pot
of the Planets;</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> have named it,
<hi>Le Pott de Chambre du Diable, the Devil's Piss-pot;
seldom dry, but often running over, as if the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
were a wounded Eye, perpetually weeping over
it.</hi>
                     </q> 'Tis said there is but one <hi>good thing in Ireland,</hi>
and that is, the Wind, as 'tis generally Westerly,
and sits fair to carry one out of it; which makes
good the old saying, <hi>'Tis an ill Wind blows no
good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some of their Chief <hi>Cities</hi> are tolerably good,
but most of them more Populous than Rich (<hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
excepted) for though they are thronged like
<hi>Hives,</hi> yet being for the most part <hi>Thieves</hi> and
<hi>Drones,</hi> they rather diminish than encrease their
<hi>Stock;</hi> and were it not for the honest <hi>English,</hi>
and Strangers amongst them, I am perswaded in
process of time, they'd be all starv'd; so that of all
the Places I have yet seen, give me <hi>Ireland</hi> to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at; for my part, I think 'tis a sort of <hi>White
Fryars at large,</hi> and <hi>Dublin</hi> the <hi>Mint to it;</hi> here's
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:59888:168"/>
nothing but Roguery; in every street you pass,
you'll either meet with some high-way Taylor, or
some Errant unsatisfy'd Pugg, that drinks nothing
but wicked Sack. But at <hi>Dublin</hi> they have a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder,</hi>
(who at present is Mr. <hi>Handcock</hi>) <q>who,
besides the Reputation that he has for his <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Laws,</hi> has also acquir'd that of a <hi>cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
and just Magistrate,</hi> impartially putting
them in Execution against lewd and wicked Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
without regard to any degree of <hi>Quality or
Riches;</hi> Instances of which are frequently seen in
his <hi>punishing Swearers</hi> with Two Shillings for each
Oath, according to a New Act of Parliament;
and setting insolvent Persons in the Stocks; and
many of the <hi>stroling courteous Ladies of the Town</hi>
have, by his Orders, been forc'd to expose their
Lilly-white Skins down to the waste at a Carts
tail; by which he is become, at once, the <hi>fear and
hatred of the Lewd,</hi> and Love and Satisfaction of
Sober Persons.</q> Both <hi>Church-men and Dissenters</hi>
are joyn'd in this noble work of exposing Vice,
and all little enough; for tho' Whores are whipt
every Sessions, (I saw seven but yesterday capering
before the Beadle) yet the Prostitutes here are such
very Prostitutes, that I heard Mr. <hi>Y</hi>—say (<hi>an
old Fornicator in this</hi> City) that tho' he had spent
his Estate on a Whore in <hi>Dublin,</hi> that his Rival no
sooner appeared, but she clung to the best Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
In this case (to use a Term in my <hi>Auction
Catalogue) he that bids most is the Buyer;</hi> and if any
difference arise, which the Gallants cannot decide,
<hi>Miss</hi> lyes with both, rather then lose a Customer.
So that you see Madam, such things as <hi>Chastity,
Wit, and good Nature,</hi> are only heard of here; such
Vertues as <hi>Temperance, Modesty, and strict Iustice,</hi>
(which your Ladyship possesses in so high a degree)
have the same Credit with the <hi>Beaus</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
which the <hi>Travels of Mandevil find with us.</hi> I do
not hereby design any thing of the true <hi>Gentry,</hi> or
<hi>Nobility,</hi> amongst whom there are Persons of as
great <hi>Valour</hi> as fair <hi>Estates,</hi> as good <hi>Literatur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi>
and <hi>Breeding,</hi> and as <hi>Eminent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Vertues, as in any of
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:59888:169"/>
the most <hi>Polite</hi> Countries. But really, Madam, if
you go into the Country, (as far as <hi>Galway</hi>) they
are as bad, if not ten times worse, then I relate 'em;
for the Men here <hi>e'en steal into the World</hi> (lying
hickle-de pickle-dey, they are half Bastards) and
ever after Thieving is as <hi>natural to 'em as eating;</hi>
and for this Reason there's scarce a Town without
a Pillory in it; <hi>Bellimany</hi> has one or two; <hi>Carlow</hi>
has two or three (I think the strongest I saw in
<hi>Ireland) Kilkenny</hi> I think as many; 'twas here I lost
<hi>my Ring, my Gloves, and my very Comb;</hi> and when
I charge 'em with it, they cry, the <hi>Devil burn 'em,</hi>
if they are Thieves; and swear by <hi>Chreest and Shaim
Patrick,</hi> that they never saw it. Madam, I suppose
you have heard of <hi>Irish Evidence?</hi> and I must say,
a <hi>Carted Bawd</hi> is a Saint to 'em. I lay at <hi>Kilkenny</hi>
but four Nights, but here is such a <hi>Den of Pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pockets,</hi>
that I think the Thieves in <hi>Drogheda</hi> are
Saints to 'em.</p>
                  <p>I saw in my Ramble to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> that Inclosures
are very rare amongst them; much of their Land is
reserved for Grazing and Pasturage; and there, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
the Grass being very sweet, and holding a
<q>constant <hi>verdure,</hi> it is (as a late Author observes)
in many places so indented with <hi>Purling Brooks</hi>
and <hi>Streams,</hi> that their Meadows look like a new
Green-Carpet border'd or <hi>fringed</hi> with the purest
<hi>Silver;</hi> yet <hi>Hay</hi> is a rarity amongst them, and
would cost them more pains than they can well
afford, towards the making of it; therefore they
seldom or never trouble their <hi>Heads</hi> or <hi>Hands</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it. And then for their <hi>Arrable</hi> Ground (as
the same Author observes) it lies most commonly
as much neglected and unmanured as the sandy
<hi>Desarts</hi> of <hi>Arabia,</hi> or a ranting young <hi>Gallant</hi>'s
old Bed-rid <hi>Spouse.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their <hi>Women</hi> generally are very little beholding
to <hi>Nature for their Beauty, and less to Art;</hi> one may
safely swear, they use no <hi>Painting,</hi> or such like Aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lliary
Aids of Fucusses, being so averse to that <hi>kind
of Curiosity;</hi> (tho' they have as much need thereof
as any I ever yet beheld) that one would think
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:59888:169"/>
they never had their Faces wash'd in their <hi>whole
Lives.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to their <hi>mishapen Legs</hi> (as a witty Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
expressed it) <hi>I'll lay them aside,</hi> and next talk
of their Courtships.</p>
                  <p>Amorous they are as <hi>Doves,</hi> but not altogether
so chaste as <hi>Turtles,</hi> desiring as much to be <hi>billing,</hi>
and very frequently bringing forth <hi>Twins.</hi> as the
others hatch young ones by <hi>Pairs.</hi> There needs no
great Ceremony or <hi>Courtship,</hi> for they generally
yield at first Summons.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Men,</hi> as <hi>Birds</hi> of the same <hi>Nest</hi> and <hi>Feather,</hi>
differ only in the <hi>Sex,</hi> not in their good <hi>Humour</hi>
and <hi>Conditions.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Thus Madam, have I given you a brief, but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Character of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which I have intermixt
with what I found by the <hi>Dear Ioys,</hi> and what I
say of these, I send to you as the Character of the
<hi>better sort of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eagues;</hi> for as for the <hi>Wild Irish,</hi>
What are they, but a Generation of Vermin? they
have Impudence enough to louse in the High-way.
I have seen <hi>six Men at it together,</hi> and a Mile farther,
<hi>as many Women</hi> at the same sport; and what is yet
more shameless, the Women were half naked. 'Tis
true, in the <hi>Infant Age,</hi> when the Innocency of
Men did not blush to shew all that Nature gave
'em (indeed because they did no more then that
taught 'em) I shou'd not have wonder'd at such
sights; but considering the Removes we are now
from <hi>Adam,</hi> I cou'd not but blush for 'em. If you
peep into forty Cabins (<hi>they are as spacious as our
English Hogsties,</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">As was hinted
before, in p. 390.</note> 
                     <hi>but not so
clean</hi>) you'll scarce find a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
with a Sm—k to her
Back, or a Pettycoat can
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:59888:170"/>
touch her Knee; and of <hi>Ten Children</hi> (for they are
full of Brats, for the reason I formerly hinted) not
one has a shooe to his foot; and when one laughs
at their Nakedness (<hi>as who can forbear that is flesh
and blood</hi>) they cry, <hi>fye! fye! English Mon, you
see nothing but what ish her own.</hi> And these <hi>Irish</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
are as proud as they are naked; and rather
then dishonour (as they call it) their Sons with a
Trade, they suffer 'em to beg for their daily bread;
and for themselves, they are so lazy, that those of
'em that are not Thieves (and of that number is
scarce one in a thousand) they live by the drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of their poor Wives.</p>
                  <p>But however careless they be of the <hi>Living,</hi> they
are mightily concerned for the <hi>Dead,</hi> having a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,
of <hi>howling</hi> when they carry any one to Buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al;
and <hi>screaming</hi> over their <hi>Graves,</hi> not like other
<hi>Christians,</hi> but like People without <hi>Hope:</hi> and soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than this shall be omitted, they do hire a whole
Herd of these <hi>Crocodils</hi> to accompany the <hi>Corps;</hi>
who with their counterfeit <hi>Tears</hi> and <hi>Sighs,</hi> and
confused <hi>Clamour</hi> and <hi>Noise,</hi> do seem heartily to
bemoan the departed Friend; though all this is
with no more concern and reality, than an Actor
on the Theatre for the feigned Death of his <hi>Dearest</hi>
in a <hi>Tragedy.</hi> Instead of a <hi>Funeral Oration,</hi> they
bawl out these or the like querulous Lamentations,
<hi>O hone! O hone! Dear Ioy, why didst thou dye and
leave us? Hadst thou not Pigs and a Potato Garden?
Hadst thou not some Sheep and a Cow, Oat-cake, and
good vsquebaugh to comfort thy Heart, and</hi> put Mirth
upon thy Friends? <hi>Then, wherefore wouldst thou
leave this good World, and thy poor Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?

                  <p>Madam, having now dispatch'd the <hi>Character of
the Dear Ioys,</hi> and troubled you with a thousand
other Impertinencies, (that I may still keep within
the bounds of my Conversation) I'll proceed in the

I made when I left Ireland,</hi> and with those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this <hi>long and tedious Letter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Madam, in these <hi>parting Visits,</hi> I had the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of being accompany'd by my two Friends,
Mr. <hi>Wilde,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Larkin;</hi> I have already given
you a <hi>brief Character of Mr. Larkin;</hi> and it would
be unjust not to give you Mr. <hi>VVilde</hi>'s, who has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
so good a one from me, by his faithful mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
my <hi>Auction.</hi> 
                     <q>Mr. <hi>VVilde</hi> (Madam) <hi>was born
a Gentleman,</hi> being descended from an Ancient
Family in <hi>Herefordshire,</hi> and brought up to learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
till he was fit for the University; but his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
leading him rather to a Trade, he was
bound an Apprentice to <hi>George Sawbridge,</hi> Esq
the greatest Bookseller that has been in <hi>England</hi>
for many years, as may sufficiently appear by the
Estate he left behind him; for (besides that he
was <hi>Chosen Sheriff of London, and paid his Fine</hi>) he
left behind him <hi>four Daughters,</hi> who had each of
'em for their Portions, <hi>Ten Thousand Pound apiece;</hi>
and you may easily imagine, Madam, that serving
a Master who drove so great a Trade, he cou'd not
fail of understanding Books, without he was
greatly wanting to himself: Which he was so far
from being, that I need not make any scruple to
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>irm, That <hi>there are very few Booksellers in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
(if any) that understand Books better then
<hi>Richard VVilde:</hi> Nor does his <hi>Diligence and Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry</hi>
come short of his Knowledge; for he is <hi>inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigably
Industrious</hi> in the dispatch of Business;
of which his <hi>managing my Auction,</hi> is a sufficient
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:59888:171"/>
Proof: He far exceeded even my Expectation,
and gave the Buyers too, such great Content, that
had I not seen, I cou'd hardly have believ'd it.
<hi>Nor does his Talent lie in knowing Books only, but he
knows Men as well too;</hi> and has the Honour to be
personally known to very many of the <hi>Nobility
and Gentry</hi> of the first Rank, both in <hi>England and
Ireland;</hi> and there's scarce a Bookseller in <hi>Dublin</hi>
but has a Kindness for him. <hi>If any thing hates
him, 'tis the Fair Sex, for his living so long a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelor;</hi>
but they might excuse him, for he's too
<hi>busie to think of Love, and too honest to Marry for
Money;</hi> and I believe scorns to creep (for 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
a Man to whine like a Dog in a Halter) to
the <hi>greatest Fortune in Dublin;</hi> not but <hi>Wilde</hi> is of
a courteous affable Nature, and <hi>very obliging</hi> to
all he has to do withal; and 'tis visible by his
Carriage, he was bred (as well as born) a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
He had a good Estate to begin the World
with, but has met with Losses; yet when his
<hi>Stars were the most unkind</hi> (as was confest in my
hearing by his raving Enemy) he was still as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
as ever; and being always just in his Dealings,
he now, like the Sun (just come from behind a
Cloud) <hi>shines brighter and fairer then ever:</hi> Some
Men are only Just whilst the World smiles; but
when it frowns, they act such little <hi>Tricks,</hi> as ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
their Vertue suspected. But <hi>VVilde</hi> ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
his Integrity, <hi>and is the same good Man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all Events;</hi> and as he was ever just in his
Dealings, so I must say his Universal Knowledge
in Books render him a fit Companion for the best
Gentleman; and his <hi>great Sobriety,</hi> a fit Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
for the <hi>nicest Christian;</hi> and to add to his
Reputation, Where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

has done such Eminent Service to the present
Government, that he can't in time but meet with
<hi>an ample Reward;</hi> and 'tis but just to think he
shou'd be prefer'd, for he's a true lover of his
Majesty, and the present Government; and a stre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
Asserter of the <hi>Rights and Liberties of the
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:59888:172"/>
People,</hi> and the Protestant Religion, in opposition
to <hi>Popery</hi> and Slavery; <hi>and this he has been from
his Youth;</hi> insomuch that for shewing his Zeal in
these things, even while he was an Apprentice,
the <hi>Tories and Iacobites</hi> (by way of derision) call'd
him <hi>Protestant Dick.</hi> And by his Management of
my <hi>Auction,</hi> he has given, both to my self and
others, such a <hi>Specimen of his Iudgment,</hi> and great
Fidelity, that the <hi>Right Reverend the Lord Bishop
of Clogher</hi> has done him the Honour (in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to me) to tell me <hi>he is
extreamly satisfy'd</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">As may be seen in <hi>p.</hi> 52. of the Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin Scuffle.</note>

assure you, Madam, I am so
well satisfy'd in his Conduct
herein, that were I to keep an <hi>Auction as far as
Rome it self,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wilde</hi> should be the sole Manager.
But tho Mr. <hi>VVilde</hi> really merits the Character I
here give him, yet he being one whom I convers'd
so much with in <hi>Dublin (which my Inclination
wou'd have led me to, if my Business had not</hi>) he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
is one of St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s <hi>Kennel of Scoundrels;</hi> by
which you may also know what to think of St. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick,</hi>
whose Characters run counter to the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of all honest Gentlemen. And yet even
in this <hi>Patrick</hi> is true to himself, and hereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
he hates <hi>Honesty and Ingenuity,</hi> where-ever
he finds it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But Madam, I fear you will think me too long
in my Character of Mr. <hi>Wilde;</hi> and I fear so too,
with respect to your Ladyship; tho' as to himself,
I have not yet done him that <hi>Iustice</hi> he deserves from
me; and therefore must remain in his Debt, till I
publish my <hi>Summer Ramble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I'll now proceed to the Account of my <hi>part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Visits;</hi> the first of which, was rather an Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
than a Visit; to the House of Dr. <hi>Phoenix,</hi>
who invited my self and three of my Friends, to
wit, <hi>Mr. Wilde, Mr. Larkin,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Price,</hi> to Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
He lives in that part of the City which is
call'd St. <hi>Thomas Court;</hi> and is a peculiar Liberty
belonging to the <hi>Earl of Meath:</hi> We found the
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:59888:172"/>
Doctor Discoursing with the Dean of <hi>Killalloo,</hi> who
Din'd with us: At our first coming, the Doctor sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
us all in a very obliging manner; but was
pleas'd to pay me a most <hi>particular Respect,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
(as he express'd it) <q>that I had so much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
the Nation in general, and himself in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
by bringing so large a Collection of valuable
Books into the Kingdom.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this first greeting, the Doctor had us into
his Laboratory, and there shew'd us his Stills, and
several great Curiosities. Before <hi>Dinner</hi> we had
some <hi>Conversation</hi> with the Dean about the <hi>Power
of Imagination;</hi> and the Dean told us he knew a
Man at <hi>Barnet,</hi> near <hi>London,</hi> about Forty years
ago, that profess'd to have a constant <hi>Converse with
the Dead;</hi> affirming, that while he was discoursing
with others, he was at the same time conversing
with the Dead. This Man wou'd utter many
strange Expressions of his Discourses with dead Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and pretended by this Converse, to tell things
done at that Moment a vast distance off, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
upon Enquiry, prov'd true. But Dinner
then coming up, put an end to our Conversation,
and found us other Business to do, then to talk of
melancholly People.</p>
                  <p>After Dinner, the Doctor's Lady told us this
Remarkable Story: That some years since, having
been deliver'd of a fine Girl, two Ladies that were
then the Doctor's Patients, desir'd the <hi>Baptising of
the Child</hi> might be deferr'd till they were able to go
abroad, because they had a mind to stand Gossip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
to it. But the two Ladies not being well enough
to go abroad, so soon as they thought at first, a
Months time was passed since the Birth of the Child,
all which time it remain'd unchristen'd. But one
day, as the Doctor's Lady was in her Chamber,
looking for something which she wanted in a Press,
on a sudden she cast her Eyes back, and saw sitting
down in a Chair, <hi>an Vnckle of hers, which had been
dead several years;</hi> at which being somewhat sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd,
she a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k'd him how he did? And he, on the
contrary, ask'd her, <hi>What was the reason she did not
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:59888:173"/>
christen the Child?</hi> She told him it was because her
Husband promis'd two Ladies shou'd be Gossips to
it, and they were both yet indispos'd, and cou'd
not come. The <hi>Spectrum</hi> then call'd her to come
to him, which she accordingly did, and he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd
her in his Arms, and kiss'd her <hi>naked Bosom,</hi>
which she said she felt extream cold: He then ask'd,
her where her Husband was? And she told him
where. After which, he charg'd her to <hi>let the
Child be christned</hi> the next day at three a Clock
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he Afternoon; and then <hi>went away, she knew not
how.</hi> When the Doctor came home, his Lady told
him what she had seen, and desir'd the Child might
be <hi>Christen'd,</hi> according to the Charge given by the
<hi>Spectrum;</hi> but the Doctor was Unbelieving, and
still resolv'd to defer it till the <hi>two Ladies</hi> could
come to be Gossips. But the time prefix'd by the
<hi>Spectrum</hi> being past, and the Child not Christen'd,
that Night the <hi>Bed-Cloaths were attempted to be pull'd
off,</hi> she crying out to the Doctor for help, who
pull'd the Cloaths up with all his Strength, and had
much ado to keep 'em on, his Wife in the mean
time crying out grievously that <hi>somebody pinch'd her.</hi>
And the next Morning, viewing of her Body, they
found she was pinch'd black and blue in several
places. This did not yet prevail with the Doctor,
to <hi>have his Child Christen'd</hi> till the <hi>two Ladies</hi>
cou'd come to be Gossips. But a day or two after,
when the Doctor was again abroad, and his Lady
alone in her Chamber, there appeared to her <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Spectrum</hi> in the likeness of her <hi>Aunt</hi> (who had
been dead near 20 years before) <hi>with a Coffin in her
hand, and a bloody Child in the Coffin,</hi> asking her in
a threatning manner, <hi>Why the Child was not Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?</hi>
She reply'd (<hi>as she had done to her Unckle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>)
that her Husband delay'd it on the Account
of two Gossips which could not yet come. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Spectrum</hi> (with a stern Countenance) said,
Let there be no more such idle Excuses, but <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
the Child to Morrow, or it shall be worse for you,</hi>
and so disappear'd. The Lady all in Tears tells the
Doctor of the Threatning of this <hi>She-Spectrum,</hi> and
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:59888:173"/>
prevails with him to have it Christned the next day;
and in three days after, the Child was over-lay'd by
the Nurse, and brought home in <hi>a Coffin all bloody,</hi>
exactly like that which was shewn her by the last
<hi>Spectrum.</hi> The Doctor confirm'd that part of the
Story which related to him; and as to the <hi>Spectrums,</hi>
his Lady aver'd before
my self, Mr. <hi>Wild,</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Larkin,</hi> who was present at these <hi>Relations,</hi> is now living in <hi>Hand-Ally</hi> in <hi>Bishops-gate-street.</hi>
                     </note> Mr. <hi>Larkin,</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Price,</hi> that what
she related, was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Truth. The
Doctor (after the Story was ended) made this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
from it, <hi>That the Baptizing of Infants was
an Ordinance of God, or else it had not been so much
in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap>ated by two Persons or Spirits risen from the</hi>
Dead. But my Friend Mr. <hi>Larkin</hi> reply'd to the
Doctor, that he was of a quite contrary Opinion,
and said it was a great <hi>Argument against Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi>
that the Devil was so earnest to have it done.
And when they both referr'd the Matter to the
<hi>Dean,</hi> he put it off, by saying. We had some Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
before Dinner of the <hi>Power of Imagination,</hi>
and this seems to be some of the Effects on't.</p>
                  <p>After this Discourse was ended, Dr. <hi>Phoenix</hi> caus'd
<hi>a Robbin-red-breast</hi> (which he had in a Cage) to be
brought into the Dining-room; where it enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
us whilst at Dinner, <hi>with singing and talking</hi>
many pleasant things; as <hi>sweet Lady, Is the Packet
come? What News from</hi> England? and several such
Expressions which the Doctor's Lady had taught it.
The smalness of this Bird renders its <hi>talking</hi> the more
remarkable; and perhaps Madam, this <hi>Robin-red-breast</hi>
is one of the greatest Rarities in <hi>Ireland,</hi> if not
in the whole World; and I believe Dr. <hi>Phoenix</hi>
thinks so; for (as small as this Bird is) he told me
he'd not sell it for 20 Guinea's; and I do think,
were it sold to the worth of its <hi>pleasant Chat,</hi>
'twou'd yield a thousand.</p>
                  <p>After I had stay'd the utmost Limits that my
Time would allow me, I took my leave of the
Dean, and then returning the Doctor and his Lady
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:59888:174"/>
Thanks for their Kindness (both to my self and my

                     </gap>; for
he was a great Encourager of my <hi>Auction,</hi> and a
very generous Bidder. But to proceed to his
Character, <q>Dr. <hi>Phoenix</hi> is a little Jolly black
Man, but so very conscientious, that he's <hi>as
ready to serve the Poor for nothing, as the Rich
for Money.</hi> His great Skill in Physick has
made him famous; and which renders him the
more Eminent, his Prescriptions are generally
successful, and his <hi>Aurum Potabile</hi> never fails.
His <hi>wise Advice</hi> has rescu'd more languishing
Patients from the Jaws of Death, then <hi>Quacks</hi>
have sent to those dark Regions; and on that
score Death declares himself a mortal Enemy to
Dr. <hi>Phoenix;</hi> whereas Death claims a Relation to
<hi>meer Pretenders</hi> to Physick, as being both of one
Occupation, viz. <hi>That of killing Men.</hi> But tho
his great Success makes Patients throng to him,
yet is he a modest, humble, and very good Man,
as appears by this; at his first coming to a sick
Man, he perswades him <hi>to put his trust in God, the
Fountain of Health.</hi> The want of such seriousness
hath caus'd the bad success of many Physitians;
for they that won't acknowledge God in their
<hi>Applications,</hi> God won't acknowledge them in
that <hi>Success</hi> which they might otherwise expect.</q>
I wou'd be larger in the Doctor's <hi>Character,</hi> but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all, must come short of it; so will add no more
about him, but shall now attempt his <hi>Ladys Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,</hi>
of whom I might say many pretty things;
but (Madam) I fear I shall tire you; however, I
say <hi>'em all in little,</hi> by only telling your Ladyship,
that the Person I'd here describe, is Doctor <hi>Phoenix</hi>'s
Wife, I say, Madam, 'tis Praise enough to say,
she is Dr. <hi>Phoenix</hi>'s Wife, and that she merits so good
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:59888:174"/>
a Husband. Then let the learned World debate as
long as they please about the <hi>Nonsuch Bird,</hi> this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
proves (by her great Vertues) that in <hi>Dublin</hi>
(if no where else) is to be seen a <hi>She-Phoenix.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Leaving Dr. <hi>Phoenix</hi>'s House, our next Visit was to
the College of <hi>Dublin,</hi> where several worthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
(<hi>both Fellows and others</hi>) had been great Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors
to my Auction: When we came to the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,
we went first to my Friend Mr. <hi>Young</hi>'s
Chamber; but he not being at home, we went to see
the <hi>Library,</hi> which is over the Schollars Lodgings
the length of one of the <hi>Quadrangles;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
a great many choice Books of great Value,
particularly one, the largest I ever saw for breadth;
'twas an <hi>Herbal,</hi> containing the lively Portraictures
of all sorts of <hi>Trees, Plants, Herbs, and Flowers:</hi>
By this <hi>Herbal</hi> lay a small Book, containing about
64 Pages in a Sheet, to make it look like the <hi>Giant
and the Dwarf.</hi> There also (since I have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
a Giant) we saw lying on a Table, the <hi>thigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone
of a Giant,</hi>) or at least, of some monstrous
over-grown Man, for the Thigh-bone was as long
as my Leg and Thigh; which is kept there as a
convincing Demonstration of the <hi>vast bigness</hi> which
some humane Bodies have in former times arriv'd
to. We were next shew'd by Mr. <hi>Griffith,</hi> a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of Art (for he it was that shew'd us these Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities)
the Skin of one <hi>Ridley,</hi> a <hi>notorious Tory,</hi>
which had been long ago Executed; he had been
begg'd for an <hi>Anatomy;</hi> and being flea'd, his Skin
was tann'd, and stuff'd with Straw; in this passive
state he was assaulted by some Mice and Rats, not
<hi>sneakingly</hi> behind his Back, but boldly before his
Face, which they so much <hi>further Mortified,</hi> even
after Death, as to eat it up; which loss has since
been supply'd by tanning the Face of one <hi>Geoghagan,</hi>
a Bopish Priest, executed about six years ago, for
stealing; which said Face is put in the place of
<hi>Ridley</hi>'s.</p>
                  <p>At the <hi>East</hi> End of this Library, on the right
hand, is a Chamber called the <hi>Countess of Baths
Library,</hi> filled with many handsome Folios, and
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:59888:175"/>
other Books, in Dutch Binding, guilt, with the
<hi>Earls Arms imprest</hi> upon them; for he had been
sometime of this House; on the left hand, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to this Room, is another Chamber, in which I
saw a great many <hi>Manuscripts, Medals,</hi> and other
<hi>Curiosities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the <hi>West End of the Library,</hi> there is a Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
made by a kind of wooden-Latice-work, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
about thirty p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ces, full of <hi>choice and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Books,</hi> which was the Library of that great
Man, Arch-bishop <hi>Vsher,</hi> Primate of <hi>Armagh,</hi>
whose Learning, and Exemplary Piety has justly made
him the Ornament not only of that College (of
<hi>which he was the first Scholar</hi> that ever was enter'd
in it, and the first who took degrees) but of the
whole <hi>Hibernian</hi> Nation. At the upper end of this
part of the Library, hangs at full length, the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of Dr. <hi>Chalon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r,</hi> who was the first Provost of
the College, and a Person Eminent for Learning
and Vertue. His Picture is likewise at the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into the Library; and his Body lies in a
<hi>stately Tomb made of Alabaster.</hi> At the <hi>West</hi> end of
the Chappel. Near Dr. <hi>Chaloner</hi>'s Picture (if I don't
mistake) hangs a <hi>new Skeleton</hi> of a Man, made up
and given by Dr. <hi>Gwither,</hi> a Physitian of careful
and happy Practice, of great Integrity, Learning,
and sound Judgment, as may be seen by those
<hi>Treatises</hi> of his, that are inserted in some late <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical
Transactions.</hi> Thus (Madam) have I gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ye a brief Account of the <hi>Library,</hi> which at
present is but an ordinary Pile of Building, and
can't be distinguish'd on the out-side; but I hear
they design the building of a <hi>New Library:</hi> And I
am told, the <hi>Hoose of Commons in Ireland</hi> have vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
3000 <hi>l.</hi> towards carrying it on.</p>
                  <p>After having seen the <hi>Library,</hi> we went to visit
Mr. <hi>Minshul,</hi> (whose Father I knew in <hi>Chester</hi>)
<q>Mr. <hi>Minshul</hi> has been Student in the College for
some time, and is a very <hi>sober, ingenious Youth;</hi>
and I do think is descended from one of the most
courteous Men in <hi>Europe.</hi> (I mean Mr. <hi>Iohn Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shul,</hi>
Bookseller in <hi>Chester.</hi>
                     </q>) After a short stay
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:59888:175"/>
in this Gentleman's Chamber, we were led by one
<hi>Theophilus,</hi> (a good natur'd sensible Fellow) to see
the <hi>New-house,</hi> now building for the <hi>Provost;</hi>
which when finish'd, will be very noble and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent.</p>
                  <p>After this, <hi>Theophilus</hi> shew'd us the <hi>Gardens</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the College, which were very pleasant
and entertaining. Here was a <hi>Sun-Dyal,</hi> on which
might be seen what a Clock it was in most parts of
the World. This Dyal was plac'd upon the top of
a Stone, representing a <hi>Pile of Books.</hi> And not far
from this was another <hi>Sun-Dyal set in Box,</hi> of a
very large compass, the Gnomoh of it being very
near as big as a <hi>Barber's Poll.</hi> Leaving this <hi>pleasant
Garden,</hi> we ascended several steps, which brought
us into a <hi>curious Walk,</hi> where we had a Prospect to
the <hi>West</hi> of the City, and to the <hi>East</hi> of the Sea
and Harbour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> On the <hi>South</hi> we cou'd see the

having now (and at other times) through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
survey'd the Colledge, I shall here attempt to
give your Ladyship a very particular Account of it;
tis call'd <hi>Trinity College,</hi> and is the sole University
of <hi>Ireland;</hi> it consists of three Squares, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
being as large as both the inner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one of which,
of modern building, has not Chambers on every
side, the other has; on the <hi>South</hi> side of which
stands the Library, the whole length of the Square.
I shall say nothing of the Library here (having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
said something of it) so I proceed to tell ye,

which I now forgot: When we were all seated, the
Collonel told me he took my coming to see him

wou'd <hi>do himself the Honour of repaying my Visit.</hi> We
next fell to discourse of the <hi>Auctions I made in Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi>

had been a <hi>great Benefactor to the Kingdom of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
by bringing into it so large a quantity of
good Books. I thank'd him for the Honour he did
me by that Expression; and further added, that if
<hi>all my Buyers, had been so generous as himself,</hi> my
Venture had been very fortunate. This Discourse
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:59888:178"/>
about my Auction, naturally led us to talk of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick
Campbel</hi> (the grand Enemy to it) and after I
had told the Collonel what Treatment I had from
<hi>Campbel,</hi> he said I had just Reason to vindicate my
self; and that he believed there never was a fairer
<hi>Auction</hi> then mine, or a better Auctioneer then
Mr. <hi>Wilde;</hi> and therefore, Madam, I dedicate the
<hi>Dublin-Scuffle</hi> to Collonel <hi>Butler,</hi> as a generous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector
of an <hi>injur'd Stranger:</hi> Upon the taking my
leave of the Collonel, he express'd himself very
sorry that I was leaving the Country, and said, If
ever I return'd with a second Venture, he wou'd
Encourage it all he cou'd; for this I return'd him
my <hi>humble Thanks,</hi> confessing my unworthiness of
those many Favours I had receiv'd from him. Then
taking my <hi>final leave,</hi> he gave me that endearing

                  <p>Madam, I told ye that Collonel <hi>Butler</hi> was very

so, as Pride lessens (or rather disgraces) Men of the

and therefore 'tis, tho' Collonel <hi>Butler</hi> is very emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
for ev'ry Vertue, yet if he excells in one more
then another, 'tis in his <hi>Great Humility;</hi> which
further appears by his inviting me of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Having left the Collonel's House, we all three
return'd to our several <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

we went to take our leaves of the Reverend
Mr. <hi>Searl</hi> (at his House in <hi>Brides Alley</hi>) and of my
worthy Friend Mr. <hi>Iones</hi> (as his House in <hi>great

I had the happiness of seeing Mr. <hi>Iones</hi>'s Sister
(a Person Eminent for her great Piety) with whom
I left a million of Thanks for all the Favours I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
from him. And here I parted with my two
Friends (Mr. <hi>VVild</hi> and Mr. <hi>Larkin</hi>) and the next
day (it being the last for <hi>taking of Farewells</hi>) every
one went as his Humor and Fancy led him. And
the <hi>first Ramble</hi> I took this Morning, was to take
my Farewell of <hi>Rings-End</hi> (where I had two or three
good Friends) 'tis about a Mile from <hi>Dublin,</hi> and is
a little Harbour like your <hi>Graves-End in England;</hi> I
had very agreeable Company to <hi>Rings End,</hi> and was
noblely treated at the Kings Head; after an hours
stay in this dear Place (as all Port-Towns general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

two or three more Friends, and now look'd towards
<hi>Dublin;</hi> but how to come at it, we no more knew
then the <hi>Fox at the Grapes;</hi> for though we saw a
large strand, yet 'twas not to be walk'd over, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of a pretty rapid Stream, which must be
crossed; we enquir'd for a Coach, and found no
such thing was to be had here, unless by accident;

the Carr, stood our Charioteer, who presently set his
Horse into a Gallop, which so jolted our sides,
tho' upon a smooth strand, that we were in Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
until we got off at <hi>Lazy-hill,</hi> where I pay'd
4<hi>d.</hi> for our fair of a Miles riding, and almost
as pleas'd as the young Gentleman that drove the
Chariot of the Sun wou'd have been, to be rid of
his Seat; however they are a great Conveniency,

                  <p>I parted with my Fellow Traveller in <hi>Essex-street,</hi>
and from thence I went to take my leave of

him without a Character; <q>He is a Man willing to

and therefore I became his quarterly Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
but as ready as he is to humor his Friends,
yet is he brisk and gay, and the worst made
for a Dissembler of any Man in the World; he's

And if ever I visit <hi>Dublin</hi> again, <hi>Mat. Read</hi> (or

that he need not practice <hi>new Experiments</hi> upon

Dr. <hi>Whaley</hi> (a great Benefactor to my three

the Doctor wou'd soon forgive him, for Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<hi>Whaley</hi> is a Man of a noble Spirit, and justly
merits the Esteem he has with ingenious Men. His
<hi>Almanack bears the Bell from all the rest in Ireland.</hi>
I was very desirous to have seen the Doctor at lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Dublin</hi> (to thank him for all his Favours)
but missing of him, I next rambled to Mr. <hi>Carter</hi>'s
in <hi>Fishamble-street;</hi> I had but just time to bid <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>

shook hands with Mr. <hi>Carter,</hi> I went next to visit

He was gone to the <hi>Custom-house,</hi> so I mist taking
my leave of him, for which I was heartily sorty,
for he was my <hi>Fellow Traveller to Malhide,</hi> and I
wanted to thank him for old Favours, but 'twas
not my luck to meet him at home; so I rambled
next to the Keys in <hi>High-street,</hi> where I met (by

to Mr. <hi>Wilde,</hi> and tells <hi>Camphel</hi> of his great Sin
in Printing <hi>Hodder's Arithmetick with Cocker's Title,</hi>
and so <hi>exit Iacob</hi> to make way for his Man <hi>Shepherd,</hi>
of whom I shall only say, <hi>Trim Tram;</hi> for he bought
Books at my Auction, and I found him an honest
Fellow, and there's an end on't. Having taken my
leave of Mr. <hi>Shepherd,</hi> and his good Master, I went
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:59888:183"/>
to spend half an hour with Mr. <hi>Corbury</hi> and his good
Wife, who are very obliging Persons, and I shall
<hi>ever love 'em</hi> (and one day requite 'em) for their
great tenderness to <hi>one of my best Friends.</hi> But the day
spends, and I have other <hi>Farewells</hi> to make, so my
next Business was to take my leave of my three
Landlords, Mr. <hi>Orson,</hi> Mr. <hi>Landers,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cawley.</hi>
As I went along, I hapned to meet with Mrs. <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi>
(a very sensible good Woman) she was going
(perhaps) to the <hi>Four-Courts</hi> to hear a Tryal she
had there depending; she hurry'd so fast after her
Lawyer, that I had but just time to bid her adieu,
and to send a <hi>tender Farewell</hi> to her vertuous
Daughter.</p>
                  <p>Having left Mother <hi>Maxfield,</hi> I stop'd no where,
'till I came to my three Landlords; I have already
sent their Characters, and shall only add, that <hi>after
a little wringing of hands,</hi> and some Tears at parting,
I took my final leave of each; and in my way home
I (unexpectedly) met with the ingenious <hi>Climene,</hi>
my <hi>Fellow-Traveller</hi> to <hi>Ballimany;</hi> we walk'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

she told me 'twas Dr. <hi>Proby;</hi> she gave him a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Character for <hi>his great success in curing the Stone;
for his Skill in Surgery, and readiness to serve the
Poor.</hi> But I had not the happiness to be known
to him, so I prevented her speaking to him, being
here met by my Servant <hi>Robinson</hi> (as true a hearted
Man as lives) and by his dear Spouse, who has
brought me a Pidgion Pye (I had almost said)
large enough to victual a single Cabin to the <hi>East-Indies.</hi>
Having taken my leave of this happy

himself of that Money he paid (for some Body) for

                  <p>And now (Madam) having in this Letter sent ye

                     <hi>So, So;</hi> However, two of the <hi>Fair Sex</hi> have been

                     </note> the Vessel,
had it nothing to work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
and being born to travel,
I am ever <hi>pursuing my Desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi>
so that you may truly call me, <hi>a Citizen of
London, and of all the World;</hi> (for I've seen <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
and design to see <hi>Europe, Asia,</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi>) yet
where e'er I come, I love to be guest at, not known,
and to <hi>see the World unseen;</hi> and for this very Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

(perhaps 5000 in number) wherein I'll
spare neither <hi>Saint nor Sinner</hi> that I ever talk'd
with; no, tho' (like a <hi>Rich Criminal</hi>) he'd buy off
his Name with a Purse of Guineas. 'Tis true, 'tis
common to write the <hi>Character of those that are
dead,</hi> but the writing the History of <hi>living Men,</hi> is
a Project never attempted before; but if every Man
wou'd attempt something of this Nature (I mean
write the <hi>History</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">As is hinted in my Preface to the <hi>Dublin Scuffle.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>of his

his Vices as Vertues) we
shou'd begin to <hi>know one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
a little: But whether
they will or not, I have here led the way, and will
pursue it till I have <hi>Characteriz'd</hi> all my Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
So that you see, Madam, tho' <hi>Rambling is
part of my Character,</hi> yet, that both <hi>my Eyes are
never at once from home,</hi> but that one keeps House,
and observes the Actions of Men, while the other
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:59888:186"/>
romes abroad for Intelligence. But Rambling ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
an ill Name, perhaps your Ladyship wou'd
willingly know something more about my Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Madam, 'tis the very same you find in
the <hi>Account of my Conversation;</hi> and let my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
say what they please, I'll never alter it, for I
never matter Abuses (when I can't avoid 'em;)
and therefore 'tis in the <hi>midst of Reflections</hi> my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
never changeth, for I know whom I have
trusted, and <hi>whether Death can lead me;</hi> and being
not so sure I shall die, as that I shall be <hi>restor'd,</hi> I
out-face Death with the Thoughts of my Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
<hi>If I am found dead upon the spot, what
matters it?</hi> For not being able to govern Events, I
endeavour to govern my self; (and sure I am, 'tis
the <hi>greatest of Dominions to Rule ones Self, and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;</hi>)
I am advanc'd already so far in this <hi>rare
Art,</hi> that I hope I may say, just Censures I deserve
not; unjust I contemn: (and notwithstanding the

the faults of my worst Enemies (when I see 'em
penitent,) so I take as much delight to <hi>blazon their

have my good Character.</hi> Vertue is so charming a

sort of <hi>Prodigy in our times;</hi> so that where e'er I
find it, I can't refrain from <hi>admiring it,</hi> and to write
<hi>a Character of the Person who I think possesses it;</hi> and
tho' I design a service to others by so doing, yet if
I lose my end, <hi>I shall rest content;</hi> for I have this
peculiar to my self, that I was never much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd

make me a jot precise (and this I learnt from

I was never forward in contracting of Friendships,

twice for his Money; (which Practice I learnt from

To summ up my Character in few words: <hi>I love

I'll Print the Character you give me, tho' 'twere a

little value the Praises of others, that I'll Print it

you'll send me your own, 'twou'd direct my Pen

which (<hi>if I know any thing of my self</hi>) is so far from

                  <p>I'll next enquire of Mr. <hi>Read</hi> (the Barber I before

has been viewing <hi>Holland,</hi> and some say, had a

tho' this be enough to attone for the <hi>seeming Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,</hi>
yet I may further add, 'tis 'nt to be
thought, that a Man that e'nt quite distracted,
wou'd quote so many Eminent Persons (and some
of the <hi>first Rank</hi>) to <hi>countenan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e that</hi> which they
cou'd contradict; and as this alone is enough to prove
the Truth of <hi>part of my Conversation:</hi> So the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi>
I made to it since I came to <hi>London</hi> (upon
a further Recollection) reconcile all the seeming
Contradictions in it: For might I not write a great
part of it at <hi>Patts Coffee-house in Dublin,</hi> and send
it to your Ladyship at your return to <hi>London</hi> (with
a desire you'd enquire after the state of my House
in <hi>Iewin-street;</hi>) and is it not equally as probable,
that when ever your Ladyship <hi>went back to Dublin,</hi> I
shou'd tell ye, upon my Arrival in <hi>London,</hi> of the
last things I did in <hi>Ireland,</hi> with the Names of the
Persons that hazarded their Lives to see me a
Shipboard.</p>
                  <p>Thus Madam, tho' unacquainted with the subtle
distinctions of Art, yet by the <hi>Clue of Truth,</hi> I have
led your Ladyship out of those Labyrinths in which
my <hi>Irish Conversation (Printed in one tedious Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>)
might seem to involve ye.</p>

But (Madam) I fear I have tyr'd you quite, and
yet cou'd scarce avoid being
thus tedious; for since I was
<note n="a" place="margin">As I said in the beginning of this Letter.</note> resolv'd <hi>to have my Cause
try'd at your Barr,</hi> 'twas ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to give you <hi>a full Account of my Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
that so, by putting things in the clearest
Light, you might be the better able to Judge me
aright. And having done this, I shall conclude
with this Request to your <hi>Ladyship,</hi> That you'd
now <hi>Read, Try, Iudge, and speak as you find:</hi>
And whatever your <hi>Sentence</hi> be, you will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Should think my self <hi>very happy,</hi> tho' much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
my Expectation, could I deserve the great
esteem you set upon my <hi>Correspondence:</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
as Charity and Compassion first begun it, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you <hi>overwhelm'd with Sorrow for the loss of your
Friend;</hi> so your taking it in so good part, obliges me
to continue any Service I am capable of doing you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="504" facs="tcp:59888:193"/>
I am so great a Stranger to you, and all your
Concerns, I can't so much as judge whether there is
any real Cause for your taking such Pains for the
<hi>Vindicating of your Reputation:</hi> However, I will
take this Occasion you offer me, to tell you my
Thoughts of your <hi>Opinions aad Practice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your <hi>general Desinition of Religion,</hi> to my Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension,
is as exact as can be comprehended in so
few words; and your <hi>universal Charity</hi> a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
Vertue; but your care of keeping a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
<hi>void of Offence towards God, and towards
Man,</hi> is not so exactly perform'd: Your going to
hear the <hi>Nouconformists</hi> Preach, must certainly give
Offence to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and perhaps to
God as well. Our Saviour Christ says, <hi>Woe to the
World, because of Offences;</hi> and sure, an <hi>unnecessary
Separation</hi> from a Church that teaches nothing
contrary to the true Faith, is the highest Offence
that can be given or taken. I shall not undertake
to justifie their <hi>Carriage to the Dissenters,</hi> I fear too
much the ill Effects of it; but whatever personal
Miscarriages has appeared, it cannot be charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Doctrine of the Church of England,</hi> it puts
no check to our living as pure and conscionably as
any <hi>Quaker</hi> can pretend to do; and must allow 'em
a tender regard to their Consciences, if they call
<hi>that the Light within 'em;</hi> but let 'em remember
our Saviour's Caveat to have a care <hi>that the Light
within 'em be not Darkness;</hi> it has one Character of the
Prince of Darkness, which is Pride, the exalting
ones self, and despising others. I think the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see</hi>
came little short of all the good Works the
<hi>Quakers</hi> pretend to; yet the <hi>humble Sinner was
rather Iustified.</hi> All separation casts a blot upon
the Church from which we depart, which we
ought not to do, be the Pretence never so plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
I know nothing could justifie our <hi>separation
from the Church of Rome, but her Defsection to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi>
and making her Errors the Conditions of her
Communion. All the Faults and Miscarriages of
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:59888:193"/>
the Church-men, should be the Subject of our <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation,</hi>
for they are the tokens of God's Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure;
and we add to our Punishment, in making
them a means of an uncharitable Division amongst
Christian Brethren; and those that do so, deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly
cut themselves off from the common Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
being Instruments of the greatest Mischief:
I mean the <hi>Teachers, not the Persons misled;</hi> those
have a title to our Pity and Commiseration. I
am sorry their <hi>Reputation for Preaching</hi> prevails with
so many to go to hear 'em; they do not consider
what St. <hi>Paul</hi> said to those that were <hi>some for
Paul, some for Cephas, and some for Apollos; nay, some
were for Christ, yet in that strise they were all Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;</hi>
besides, it gives the greatest Advantage to the
Enemies of the reformed Churches to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into the shapes of such Teachers to delude
us, and keep up those Factions and Animosities, by
which they take occasion to scorn and despise our
Church and Reformation, and strengthen Mens Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
against it.</p>
                  <p>I am as much perswaded as you, <hi>that Religion
does not consist in Names or Things;</hi> and that Christ's
Church is not limited to any Nation or Party. Our
Saviour tells us, <hi>we shall all be taught of God,</hi> whose
infinite and miraculous Power extends to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the World, often inlightning them in the
midst of Darkness; but where he has set Lights in
his Church, and appointed <hi>visible means of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
there to despise 'em, and chuse to stray into
By-Paths, makes us unworthy of the Blessing we
enjoy, and liable to the Judgment of falling into
Snares and Temptations.</p>
                  <p>I think your Arguments against the <hi>Atheist,</hi> are
as convincing as could be found out; and your
<hi>abstracted Notion of the Divine Being</hi> is very good,
and suits exactly with what I have read in a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
written by <hi>Albertus Magnus.</hi> Your behaviour
at publick Assemblies, and your Care and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
for the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> are very commendable
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:59888:194"/>
Marks of Piety and Devotion; and indeed, with
that Qualification carried with us, <hi>no Message from
God but will be welcome,</hi> tho' from the Mouth of
very weak or unworthy Messengers. I am much
pleased with your Thoughts of the <hi>Communion of
Saints,</hi> and could wish the World had a freer En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of it.</p>
                  <p>I highly approve your Care for the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> but
am surpriz'd you should <hi>refer your self to me in so
great a point.</hi> I will tell ye my Thoughts, and not
lead you out of the way, if I can help it: All the
Authors I have ever read agree, that the <hi>Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Sabbath is partly Moral, and partly Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial,</hi>
that we should worship and adore that great
God that gave us Being, at a certain time alotted
for it, the <hi>light of Nature tells us;</hi> and therefore,
that a <hi>seventh part</hi> of our time should be set apart
for a solemn and publick Worship of God, is purely
<hi>Moral;</hi> the <hi>Cerimonial part</hi> is the choice of the
day. We find God chose the <hi>last day of the Week</hi>
for a Memorial of the Creation finish'd in six days;
but not so strictly confined to the remembrance of
the Creation, but also of the <hi>Israelites</hi> deliverance
out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> a <hi>Type of our Salvation by Christ,</hi> as
may be seen in the 5<hi>th of Deuteronomy;</hi> with good
reason therefore is it now kept in memory of the
last and greatest benefit, the accomplishment of our
Redemption, and on that account changed to the
first day of the Week, upon which day our Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
was finish'd by our Saviour's rising from the
Dead; this <hi>change was made in the Apostle</hi>'s <hi>time,</hi> as
appears by their so often meeting on the first day of
the Week, recorded in the Scripture, and that they
had our Saviour's Countenance and Authority for it,
by his appearing so often to 'em in their Assembly
on that day. I think one need <hi>not be so scrupulous
about the day,</hi> but submit to the decision of the
Church, who probably fetch'd it from the Practice
of the Apostles. Our Saviour tells us <hi>the Sabbath
was made for Man, and not Man for the Sabbath;</hi>
and 'tis of more moment to observe the Duties of
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:59888:194"/>
the day, then to be able to answer all Objections
and Contentions, that ill designing Persons can raise
against it. That we dedicate a <hi>seventh day</hi> to God's
Service, according to his own appointment, and
upon the first day of the Week, in memory of the
<hi>great Work of our Redemption</hi> finish'd upon that day,
is satisfactory enough to me; and if I sincerely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the Duties of the day, I make no question of
Gods Acceptance. For the resting from bodily La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
so strictly injoyn'd to the <hi>Iews,</hi> I take to be
partly abolish'd with the other Ceremonies, only
retaining so much as is necessary to support the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
of the Day. I think none can be too strict
<hi>in consecrating to God that day as totally as our Frail
Natures will permit;</hi> and tho we can't be all the day
(besides the publick Service) taken up in Prayers and
Meditation, we may do well to keep our selves out
of the way of the World, which will <hi>soon quench
the Flame our Divine Exercises have kindled;</hi> but
there were nothing like the Conversation of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
minded Persons, when we can have such;
and there are <hi>Works of Mercy and Compassion</hi> very
proper for that day, which may raise our Minds to
Love and Praises to God, for making us Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in his hand for the good of any body. In a
word, <hi>the best Instructor in the Duties of the Lord's
Day, is Love;</hi> which will make us do all with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
and delight, by which I may suppose you
are animated to what you do, or desire to do, on that
blessed day.</p>
                  <p>I agree with you, that <hi>the Duty of Prayer is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
even by the Light of Nature.</hi> That Supream
Being, that made us, can only preserve us, and to
him we must apply for our well-being; but Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
that are <hi>dedicated to God in Baptism,</hi> should
take care to <hi>sanctify all the Actions of their Lives
by Prayer,</hi> and never do that thing they dare not beg
God's blessing upon: If we did impute to God the
happy success of all our Labours, we could not be
so wanting to our selves, as to neglect that <hi>great
Favour and Priviledge of a Christian, of represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:59888:195"/>
all our Wants and Necessities to God,</hi> and enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
his Care and Providence in our behalf, of beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his holy Spirit, which he has promised to <hi>those
that as it;</hi> which <hi>will lead us into all Truth;</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>cuse and condemn our selves for sin and
then engage us to the <hi>Duty of thankfulness;</hi> and here
I know no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> where to begin or make an end, <hi>Innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
are the Mercies</hi> we daily receive, and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to imploy all the moments of our Life in the
Contemplation of them, and were our Hearts truly
thankful, nothing could be wanting to keep us close
to our Duties, both to <hi>God and our Neighbour;</hi>
whatever different ways and modes we find of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
it. I dare be bold to pronounce <hi>That Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
a true Child of God, that in a deep sence o his own
unworthiness looks upon all the mercies he enjoys, as
the favour and bounty of heaven, for which he can never
be sufficiently thankful.</hi> And I do not know a stronger
Foundation to build any Persons Conversion upon,
for if they are born of Christian Parents, when they
consider that Blessing and Priviledge which Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
want, it must needs engage 'em in his Service
who has <hi>dealt so Lovingly with 'em;</hi> But if an
<hi>Alien</hi> from the Church of God, should by some
great Providence meet with the opportunity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
instructed in the saith, how can he chuse but
look upon this good Providence as the effect of Gods
Merciful kindness to him, and work a more <hi>kindly
Obedience,</hi> then all the Terrours of Hell. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
the <hi>threats of Hell,</hi> is a way I am little acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with, yet must own, <hi>We cannot know Gods Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in its full extent, without knowing to the full the
miseries from which it has redeem'd us.</hi> But this
works naturally upon our Love, and turns it into
such a fear as works again by Love, and makes our
obedience chearful and free, yet I shall not pretend
to <hi>censure</hi> those that perhaps experience teaches to
use <hi>harsher methods;</hi> but I bless God for his more
tender dealing with me, for I am perswaded those
<hi>Conflicts and Temptations</hi> so many find upon their
<hi>Death-Beds,</hi> are the effects of those horrours their
teachers infuse into 'em; for I may say with thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:59888:195"/>
                     <hi>I never saw any one in that condition, of all my
Friends that I have Buried.</hi> And I make no doubt,
but the subtilty of the Devil is never wanting to
make his advantage of our <hi>Fears, Scruples and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions,</hi>
when he terrifies us with <hi>Apparitions and
Spectrums;</hi> It is certainly a great Happiness to be
free from the fears of 'em, for which you have just
cause to bless God, and I can speak it by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<hi>Those Ominous Presages of Persons, Deaths, or
Misfortunes, never happen'd to me, nor many of my
Relations;</hi> Who all held a Principle against Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition,
or any observation of such things.</p>
                  <p>Your humble and <hi>uncommon Confession</hi> of your
own Frailties, is what we must all own as well as
you, if we chuse <hi>good Principles for our Conduct;</hi>
'tis all the Vertue we can pretend to, the exact Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
depends upon many things not in our
Power.</p>
                  <p>Your neglect and disregard of <hi>dressing, and fine
Cloaths,</hi> suits the Temper and Inclination of the
Wise, and Men of Business; <hi>'tis a weakness even in
Women,</hi> but a great Folly in Men; and a true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
may be often made of the Intellects of both
Sexes by their Dress.</p>
                  <p>You have a <hi>strange Happiness for a Man of Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
to have so much liesure for <hi>Divine Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Fields,</hi> and other pleasant Places, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
you furnish your Mind with Pious Ejaculations,
which serves you upon occasion to obtain <hi>Gods Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
Blessing and Conduct</hi> in your Affairs; <hi>'tis
then the Business goes pleasantly on, when the success
is perfectly resignd to God.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>You give the Characters of <hi>several honest Men, and
one good Wife,</hi> I suppose you take 'em for some of
the <hi>Rarities of that City;</hi> the Places you describe are
unknown to me; I never took the pains to see 'em,
and if I had, perhaps my own Observation would
have come <hi>short of your pleasant Description.</hi> I am,
little fond of pleasing my sight; wherever I live,
<hi>my House and Garden limits my Curiosity;</hi> which is
the Reason I am as much a <hi>Stranger to Ireland,</hi> as
those that never were there.</p>
                  <p>I am much delighted with the Account you
give of the <hi>Church and State;</hi> and am perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perswaded my Lord <hi>Galway</hi> justly deserves
the high Character you give him in every respect;
and sure much of the <hi>present Happiness of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
is owing to his wise Conduct, and great Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Vertue and Piety; to my knowledge there's
nothing like it for those People there, who live by
<hi>no Rule but Imitation;</hi> and the severest Laws would
have much less effect on 'em, then his <hi>obliging Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desention.</hi>
I wonder what's <hi>become of all the Iaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites?</hi>
There are some for certain, but not so <hi>bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd</hi>
                     <pb n="512" facs="tcp:59888:197"/>
perhaps in such a Government, as to be noted
of Strangers.</p>
                  <p>'Tis also matter of great Joy, to hear the <hi>Bishops
and Clergy</hi> perform their parts with so much Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Condesention to the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> as gives 'em
occasion to commend their <hi>Moderation and Piety:</hi>
It were much to be wish'd, that all our unhappy
Differences might be <hi>consumed in Flames of Charity;</hi>
and <hi>Ireland,</hi> as much as it has been despised, might
have the honour to set us that great Example;
then, as that good Prelate, Bishop <hi>Hall</hi> advis'd,
<hi>we should have Peace with all but</hi> Rome <hi>and
Hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis observable, there are <hi>no Places</hi> where Care is
so effectually taken to suppress <hi>Popery, as where they
abound most,</hi> and are best known; which may be
the reason that in <hi>Ireland</hi> they have in that point
out-done us here. It would be a <hi>great Pleasure to
me, to think as you do,</hi> that the Romish Religion
were on its last Legs in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and sure nothing
is more likely to produce that effect, then those
Methods they have taken; or which would better
secure the <hi>Rebellion of that Kingdom,</hi> beyond all the
suppressing Laws; for while there are Papists to
improve every failing or miscarriage in the <hi>Rulers,</hi>
and every defect or weakness in the Capacities of
the People, to the raising such appearances to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
'em, as may serve to the promoting their own
Interest and Religion, nothing can be expected but
<hi>Rebellion and Mischief;</hi> but they who have the ART
OF LIVING INCOGNITO, How is it possible to
be sure they are rid of 'em, as hard to know as
their great <hi>Patron, the Devil,</hi> when transform'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an Angel of Light? No, I have no hopes from
the rigor of any Laws made against 'em; all my
hopes is, that as that <hi>adulterous Church</hi> has liv'd so
long, she is now grown old and ugly, the time is
coming, that all her Lovers will hate her, <hi>tear her
Flesh, and burn her City with Fire;</hi> all things seem
to be preparing for her Execution, notwithstanding
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:59888:197"/>
the <hi>French Kings Persecution;</hi> and who knows but
the <hi>Pope's mournful Iubilee</hi> may not be a Prognosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of it.</p>
                  <p>That old Father <hi>Kereen,</hi> I believe I have heard
of; there was such an one lived at <hi>Athlone,</hi> who
used to say he could <hi>lay a Spirit for seven year, and
then again for seven more;</hi> tho' I am of Opinion
they are never wanting to contrive some Impostor,
when necessary to shew their Power, and to delude
the People, and keep up their <hi>Credulity and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition:</hi>
Yet I believe as well, that they are able to
do it, when ever there is any real Occasion for it,
they are many of 'em Men of <hi>much Thought and
Retirement,</hi> only designd for the promoting the
Kingdom of Satan; he can't deny his Assistance
for the carrying on his own Work, and no question
teaches 'em the way he will be dealt with; 'tis a
great Happiness for the poor People to be rid of
such <hi>Ghostly Fathers,</hi> their Superstition once cur'd,
may probably secure 'em from those Miseries.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Church you went to where there was Musick,</hi>
gives much opportunity of gazing; the Mind having
the least part in that Service of all the rest, it seems
to me you should have had more reason to have
yielded to the <hi>Eastern Custom of separating the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
from the Men,</hi> had the Women appeared more
beautiful, since that and <hi>soft Musick</hi> might have
discompos'd your Temper for the <hi>Sermon.</hi> For my
part, I think <hi>Womens Devotions</hi> are as much <hi>distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with gazing at one another, observing how they
look, and how they dress,</hi> that I could wish some
Habit were appointed to be worn in Religious As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies,
that would give us all the same Air, that
<hi>neither Beauty nor Quality</hi> could be distinguish'd:
I mean only those that sit in Pews and Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
for the ordinary sort, there's less danger,
they'll not make it their Pride to dress, if Quality
don't.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="514" facs="tcp:59888:198"/>
I easily credit you, and <hi>believe 'twas more then a
Fancy,</hi> that you saw nothing handsome in all the
<hi>Female Faces;</hi> I have observed in many Churches
of late years, the same thing; and wonder for what
reason <hi>all Beauty should be fled out of the World,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it be for the ill treatment it finds here; and
truly Women make a pretty good shift without it,
<hi>taking upon 'em the part that once belong'd to Men;</hi>
and obtain by flattery and cajoling, what Beauty
us'd to do by Conquest; but I confess <hi>Beauty and
Charming are two things with me;</hi> there is a grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
in Meen and Motion, proceeding from the
Mind, and makes the <hi>whole Aspect charming,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the help of Complection and Feature; <hi>Vertue
makes the truest Beauty, and the softest Charms for
the best and wisest Persons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am of Opinion, as you insinuate, that <hi>Memory
is not the chief Qualification for profitable hearing of
Sermons,</hi> as 'tis a means God has appointed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
us as from himself, to observe what <hi>touches
us in particular</hi> is all the concern we have in it;
when God speaks to the Heart, we can't but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
and take notice of it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Character of your Antagonist</hi> has given a very
natural Description of <hi>Pride and Meanness,</hi> two
things nearer related then the World imagines,
which is often brought to the first, but always takes
Authority to despise and reproach the latter; but
Experience shews us <hi>Pride</hi> never prospers and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
so much as in Persons of <hi>mean Quality,</hi> or
small parts, rais'd to great Honour or Riches; and
Sordidness often comes into the Society, but serves
only to make <hi>Pride the more hated,</hi> no body gaining
by it; thus loaded with so many ill Qualities, he
must needs act as he did; 'tis the part of a <hi>generous
Enemy to conceal his History;</hi> and of a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
to let nothing provoke you to expose it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
the good of the Publick require it.</p>

'Tis no surprise to hear so many of the <hi>Players in
Dublin</hi> are no way inferior to those in <hi>London;</hi> 'twas
never the temper of <hi>Ireland</hi> to let any Country
out-doe 'em in <hi>Vanity and Idleness,</hi> two things that
will <hi>secure a Player from starving;</hi> and where they
find their Interest, their Company is never want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

for all their constant attendance there, I fear such
Gentlemen are much Strangers to those Vertues

with so much care and diligence.</p>
                  <p>I think that Gentleman had a great deal of time

had disappointed him of Applause and Admiration,

to think <hi>his Happiness resembles so much the Ioys

<pb n="516" facs="tcp:59888:199"/>
owe the <hi>last Perfection</hi> in her Character to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation;
so that the Family may well be <hi>agreeable
to the degree you speak of, the Master and Mistress</hi>
being also Persons of so much Merit.</p>
                  <p>The remarkable <hi>Fruitfulness of Mr. Hook</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable,
but the <hi>two and twenty Brothers</hi> listed in
<hi>Ireland</hi> as much; many Children are not only
Blessings, but may be observed to be given most
commonly to <hi>good People that have not repined at
'em,</hi> but been thankful for 'em; and where they
live to Men and Womens Estate, are very often
Persons of Piety and Vertue; the necessity they
find of <hi>yielding and complying</hi> with one another in
their Youth, <hi>forms in 'em such a habit of self-denial,</hi>
as fits 'em to receive other good Impressions in their

                        </gap> Indication,</hi> that Money is generally

                  <p>That <hi>dignifyed Woman, call'd the most Ingenious,</hi>

Modesty,</hi> that he should take such a Journey so ill
appointed for his Business.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dublin</hi> is very happy in a <hi>Banker,</hi> such a one as

                  <p>I more admire then envy the <hi>celebrated female

the <hi>fineness of Poetry</hi> can never make up for the
unruliness of Fancy, when indulged, which Poets
must allow; to have ones Thoughts <hi>sober and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,</hi>
is a happiness of much value to me.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Aged Woman</hi> you discoursed of, was a great
Prodigy, if her <hi>Vnderstanding and Iudgment</hi> had
been as strong and lasting as her Senses, her Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
might have given us much Instruction.</p>
                  <p>I fancy it was a very pleasing surprise, to find a
<hi>Person that perfectly resembled one you thought so
accomplish'd;</hi> one of the Persons you wish'd to see;
so near a resemblance of, I never saw; <hi>but for the
other,</hi> her <hi>Beauty was superlative</hi> before the Small
Pox; but after that, she had not <hi>many Equals;</hi>
but never expect to find in this Age, her sort of
Beauty, which consisted so much in <hi>Majesty and
Grandeur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Dangerfield</hi> I uever saw, and can have no
Notion of the <hi>Gentleman's Perfections</hi> from him;
but your Character makes him <hi>very fine;</hi> and I
suppose his <hi>Ladies Vertues</hi> put you in mind of
<hi>Wives making good Husbands:</hi> I have seen great al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
in Mens Tempers, from the Conversations
of their Wives, and for the worse, as often as for
the better; but to the making a good Husband,
no doubt <hi>Meekness and Patience</hi> are the best Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients,
with the addition of some <hi>cunning and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi>
                     <pb n="518" facs="tcp:59888:200"/>
and will go much further in that business, then
<hi>Piety and Charity, unless, Prayes and Tears</hi> are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
to be of any force.</p>
                  <p>The Gentleman you describe, besides his <hi>Bravery
and Courage,</hi> his being so full of <hi>Love and Pity,</hi>
may be the chief reason of his not Marrying, in <hi>Love
and Compassion to himself,</hi> declining a Condition of
so much toil and trouble, and <hi>in pity to the Lady,</hi>
whose share must be more then double to his.</p>
                  <p>I am very apt to believe the <hi>Nonconformists</hi> may
be in themselves the worthy Men you represent
'em; but wish I could discover what good end
they propose to themselves in Preaching? If to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
us of the <hi>Errors of our Church,</hi> will not
Writing do that as well, if it is an Error we are
ignorant of? But should it be one we know, and
for Interest, or other reasons, maintain it, there's
small hopes then of our Conviction; yet it must
be a very considerable Error that will justifie their
<hi>publick Preaching,</hi> to draw Persons off from our
Church; but the difference <hi>between us is not so
great, if the Presbyterians approve 36 of our Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
the other three had better be made <hi>a Sacrifice
to Peace and Vnity,</hi> then give our Enemies so much
Advantage against us by our Divisions; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
they design by their <hi>Excellent Preaching,</hi> to
draw so many to their Party as may fright the
Church of <hi>England</hi> into a compliance with 'em;
if such a thing should happen, one can't com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the means they used to accomplish it, so
far remote from <hi>Peace and Charity;</hi> they seem
purely humane, and if God should draw from such
ways his own Glory, yet who knows how their
Presumption may be chastised? At the same time
God has better ways of his own, if we could
patiently wait and relye on him; when we go
about 10 mend things, we with <hi>our Pride and
Perverseness</hi> make 'em worse; of which the last
<hi>Civil War in England</hi> is a great Instance. Had

as the Man that wore it;</hi> no doubt the Devil has

frequently does it, when God permits; taking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

for <hi>discovery of Murders,</hi> and such things that seem

we should not stay till we are inform'd, but
take it <hi>for granted, there are Persons that belie, and
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:59888:201"/>
speak ill of us;</hi> What is there surprising in that,
which is the common treatment the World gives
and takes? It had been strange <hi>a man of his Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter</hi>
should shew any Civility, as he thought you
his Enemy; when he shew'd so little at first, when
he might <hi>hope to make you his Friend!</hi> That other
Man you had reason to thank, for giving you the
opportunity to <hi>clear your self to my Lord Mayor,</hi>
which was publick enough for the Worlds notice;
and succes, enough afterwards, to meet with <hi>an

                  <p>But 'tis the greatest wonder to me, you should
<hi>come off so well with that beautiful Country Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman!</hi>
If she had had no <hi>Beauty,</hi> her agreeable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
and Modesty, with a little <hi>complaisance for
you, had been charm sufficient to engage you;</hi> but
that you could trust your self to <hi>contemplate every
particular Beauty, both of Body and Mind,</hi> is daring
to astonishment, in a Man that values himself upon
his Vertue! But you will say, her Vertue abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
secured you; how great soever that was,
<hi>her Courage</hi> seems no less, in exposing her self to
the <hi>danger of pleasing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tho' Beauty is no great matter in its self, yet
the <hi>Price</hi> the World sets upon it, should make it
of some value to the Owners. What made <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
find out so contemptible a comparison <hi>for a
fair Woman without Discretion,</hi> but to shew us that
whoever is <hi>possess'd of such a Treasure,</hi> should esteem
it at the rate others do; which is agreeable to
common sence? What could one think of a Person
that should walk the Streets, and go to Markets
and Fairs <hi>dress'd up in Iewels</hi> to a great Value?
Should one not tax her Discretion, or think she
had some <hi>strange design</hi> in it, to make a tryal how
many Enemies she should meet? which would be
<hi>almost</hi> as many as saw her; some designing her
mischief to get her <hi>Iewels,</hi> others jeering and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
her in all places for her folly; for <hi>Beauty
much resembles Iewels in this, that tho' they are the
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:59888:201"/>
chiefest bravery of Nature,</hi> they are of the least use;
so one may be very happy without Beauty; but
when one is possess'd of such a Treasure, it ought
to be secur'd by <hi>Modesty, and a discreet value</hi> of it,
and not carelesly expos'd to pleasing, but only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
just occasion: But a <hi>married Woman</hi> with such
a careless Conduct, making no distinction, is as
ridiculous as <hi>a waiting Woman</hi> would be, who had
her Lady's Jewels in her keeping, and should lend
'em to the <hi>Milk-women</hi> to dress up their Pails for
dancing.</p>
                  <p>My design in all this, is to prove there would be

to take off <hi>Slander,</hi> since there is <hi>a Charity much in

notoriously bad, which in this <hi>refined Age</hi> are very
few that appear so; her Husband had been her best
support, had he <hi>believ'd her Vertuous upon his own

I fear your Judgment was not generally priz'd at

                  <p>However, I can't but applaud <hi>your happy retreat</hi>

                  <p>The very same <hi>Doctrine Mr.</hi> Cowley <hi>teaches for
Retirement, I establish for Friendship;</hi> which never

the <hi>Rules of Friendship</hi> are as severe as School-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
to Boys, with their <hi>Heads full of Play;</hi>
who are no less blind to all the Pleasures and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages

that in <hi>Retirement</hi> can be every thing to its

Thoughts</hi> a Friend would yield us, should infinitely
add to the Perfection of such a Life? And tho' li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

to be depriv'd of the Society of the Vertuous and
Religious, is to cut our selves off from the chief
Pleasure that give us <hi>a taste of Heaven upon Earth;</hi>
with the opportunity of a delightful Improvement
of every Moment of our time spent in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation.</p>
                  <p>Nor can I think that great Emperor, <hi>Charles</hi>
the 5<hi>th.</hi> could have boasted half that sweetness he
found in his <hi>change of Life,</hi> had he wholly retired
from the Conversation of the <hi>Divine Valdesso;</hi> but
you must ever be a Stranger to the <hi>true Pleasures of
Retirement,</hi> as much as you pretend to love it,
you carry such <hi>a busie Mind about with you,</hi> and
croud your Thoughts with <hi>Fields, Gardens, Parks,
your House, and absent Friends.</hi> How could you
take any thought for a House left in the Conduct
of <hi>such a Wise?</hi> 'Tis only extravagant and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly

                  <p>No question you were as much in <hi>Valeria's

your self to think, <hi>if time wou'd unweave your Life

You are now convinced of the Vanity of that
Presumption, not having had Death, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Preparations for it, so much in your Thoughts,
as you then promis'd your self. This is <hi>judging
others by my self,</hi> if it is rash and false, I beg your
Pardon.</p>
                  <p>I confess I always look'd upon <hi>Sickness</hi> as the
greatest of all temporal Evils; and Health the most
considerable of earthly Blessing; What can discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

discomposes all serious Thoughts; <hi>for my self, I

my self with all the Patience I could muster up,

which of 'em God pleases to appoint me; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

Repentance we can then exercise. Nor can I
think it a Presumption, because not built on our
<hi>own Performances,</hi> but upon the Promises of God.
If it is possible to judge of the truth of any Divine
Grace, 'tis possible to know they are his chosen to
whom he gives it, How can the <hi>Holy spirit witness

if we are Strangers to what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Graces are the Earnest of our Eternal Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
they are the Gifts of God, which he never
withdraws, for his Gifts are without Repentance:

                     <hi>Nor is Assurance a particular favour to some, but to
all his chosen, that are careful to try themselves, and
their Graces;</hi> and for those that fear Assurance
should make 'em Libertines, they would find the
contrary if they had it; for it is not the fancy of
having, but the <hi>real Possession of true Grace creates
Assurance,</hi> which will be seen and known by its
Effects, as a Tree by its Fruits; and no such mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to lead a heavenly Life on Earth, as a firm
Assurance in the Exercise of Divine Graces, that
we are <hi>consigned to a glorious Immortality in Heaven,</hi>
so remote from the Changes and Uncertainties in
this Life; tho' perhaps in some sort, a necessary
quality for the imperfect Pleasures this World af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
us.</p>
                  <p>A little longer Enjoyment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of your <hi>Earthly Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice</hi>
in the Country, would have put you upon the
search of Business in Town, only upon account of
<hi>Variety,</hi> and the Idea of it now you are snatch'd
from it, has more of Pleasure in it, then a <hi>longer
Enjoyment</hi> would have given you.</p>
                  <p>I perceive we are obliged to your <hi>Inquisitiveness
and Curiosity;</hi> (a Character you give your self;)
for leading you to so many different Places, which
furnish'd your <hi>Table-book</hi> with Remarks which we
shall see in Perfection in your <hi>Summer Rambles;</hi>
and above all, the fine History of Lord <hi>Clonuff,</hi> of
whom I never heard till now.</p>
                  <p>You had a very <hi>uncommon and particular Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest</hi>
you had reason to prize, in meeting in your
ordinary Conversation, <hi>five Persons Eminent for Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Wisdom, Learning, and all other Vertues;</hi> and I
agree with you, that the best Consolation in the
want of such Company, is <hi>Reading, especially the
Bible,</hi> what ever Opinion the generality of the
World has of it, if read without <hi>Pride and Curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
An humble Spirit that reads and lays it up in
their Minds, finds a time, by Gods special Favour
and Blessing, to understand and apply it to 'em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:59888:203"/>
for their Comfort and Direction in <hi>proper
times and occasions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Following your Fancy led you to a great deal of
Variety, but the <hi>Bowling-green</hi> above all, has
Charms for me; I think it <hi>no improper Recreation
for Ladies;</hi> and where Men, who are desirous to
Civilize themselves in Ladies Companies, might
partake with them there. The only difficulty is,
there are very <hi>few Bowling-greens</hi> in private Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
they are so chargable to keep; and all <hi>publick
Meetings</hi> for Diversion, soon grows scandalous in
this corrupt Age.</p>
                  <p>The Pleasures of <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> so magnificent as you
describe, might give one the Idea <hi>of a Paradice,</hi>
were not one Principle, Felicity, wanting, of <hi>not
being able to contain a great Mind.</hi> You say the
Owner lives like one <hi>that</hi>'s <hi>much above it;</hi> so he
may say, as a great Favourite in the Court of <hi>Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suerus,
What does all this avail me?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And truly by the Company he had a <hi>Bowles</hi>
with him, I am apt to think there were others also
as soon satisfied, and had enough of his <hi>Paradice;</hi>
they are all Pleasures for the Eye, which is <hi>never sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with seeing,</hi> but by change of Objects is in
<hi>perpetual search of a Felicity,</hi> which always come<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

far short of our Expectations. The <hi>Novelty once

                  </p>
                  <p>Sure the Natives of that Place where the <hi>four
Elements are so pure,</hi> must needs have a more <hi>refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Nature.</hi> I shall observe with more exactnes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the <hi>Character of those Persons,</hi> when I come to 'em;
and indeed you find <hi>so many things to admire,</hi> in a
Country where others think every thing deserves to
be despis'd; makes me believe <hi>the Perfection lies in
your self,</hi> that knows how to extract out of every
Subject, all the Vertues it contains; that temper
fits you <hi>for a Traveller,</hi> whose design is <hi>Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
and truly, the <hi>Contemplation of Perfection is
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:59888:204"/>
pleasanter than of Faults and Defects;</hi> that meer
self-love is enough to perswade us, while we fix
our Thoughts upon the first, to over-look the
latter.</p>
                  <p>And that Lady, whose full <hi>Character</hi> you reserve
for another Place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I own <hi>would reconcile me to any
Country</hi> and Circumstance, that would give me the
<hi>opportunity of Edifying</hi> in her Conversation.</p>
                  <p>That great and generous <hi>Brigadeer,</hi> who treated
all so nobly, shews the <hi>largeness of a French-man's
Soul,</hi> when out of the slavery of his own Country,
and under the benign influence of a Lord <hi>Gall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi>
Your Poem was deservedly dedicated to him,
I shall spare my Remarks upon it; I don't pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to <hi>judge of Wit, but shall leave it to its
Peers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One can't but look upon those <hi>miserable Cabins</hi>
you describe, as the just desert of <hi>Sloth and Idleness;</hi>
and by their manner of living in 'em, one might
believe St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Injunctions had been observed in
the severest sence, <hi>that because they did not work, they
had been deny'd the Food of their Souls, as well as
Bodies.</hi> 'Tis a severe reflection upon us, to suffer
those that are, or should be Christians, to live just

                  <p>I can't blame you for leaving those <hi>sad Objects

                  <p>I might suppose there were <hi>no Beggars in Ireland,</hi>
from your making no Remarks of the Charity,

                     </hi>
you mention, as well as from your saying nothing
in particular of the Beggars; for I am satisfied, 'tis
the <hi>false notion of the Charitable,</hi> that makes so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Beggars, when they think themselves obliged to
give to all that ask, from our Saviour's Command;
they are not so ready to take notice, that he adds,
<hi>and from him that would borrow of thee, turn thou
not away;</hi> the World abounds not much with that
kind of Charity: To my apprehension, our Saviour
intended that Precept to shew us the charitable
Disposition a Christian ought to have, both to give
or lend, upon occasion; but not to make our
selves and <hi>Charity a Prey</hi> to those that make it
their Trade to cheat and abuse both the one and
the other: There is nothing would do Charity
more right, then <hi>a Law that should forbid relieving
Beggars at Random,</hi> meerly to be rid of their Noise
and Clamour; and ways found out to employ the
Charity of well-disposed Persons, to the good and
benefit of the Town and Country where they live;
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:59888:207"/>
that the <hi>truly Poor</hi> may find Persons to apply to for
Relief, who both knows them and their Wants:
Such a Law, and the careful Execution of it,
would deserve the Parliaments Care, as much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
as any other they can pretend to bless the
Nation with; and thus the <hi>publick Charity</hi> secured,
there is more liberty for the private, of which the
charitable Persons themselves takes so slight ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
<hi>their left hand scarce knows what their right
hand does,</hi> so many and various are the occasions of
Charity they are ingaged in, consisting in many
<hi>different ways of doing good,</hi> as in lending Money or
Goods, and not exacting the Payment where the
Persons are not in a Condition to pay; in forgiving
Wrongs and Injuries, concealing and bearing with
Infirmities; in Advice, and Admonishing; in a
word, in every thing in which we can assist ones
Neighbour, tho' with some difficulty and hardship
to ones self.</p>
                  <p>Your <hi>Character of Ireland</hi> in Verse, is very fine
and just, but I shall shorten my Reflections upon
your <hi>Prose Character,</hi> 'tis not a Subject I love to
dwell upon; perhaps the <hi>moisture of the Air</hi> may
contribute much to their flegm and sloth; but I
suppose 'tis the contempt in which the Government
holds 'em, that is the cause of their <hi>brutality;</hi> sure
if it were thought worth their Pains, they are as
capable of being civiliz'd as the other barbarous
Nations who have been brought to Christianity.
You talk of <hi>Priests</hi> for their Conductors, sure they
must have been <hi>Priests of Dan,</hi> that had so well
instructed those People; for I perceive the best
among 'em, that live in Cities, excell only in
<hi>fashionable Villanies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am inclin'd to think your Friend <hi>Wilde</hi> deserves
to the full, all the Glories of his Character, both
as to his <hi>Vertues, and natural Endowments;</hi> to be
as you affirm of him, the <hi>same good Man in all
Events, and a fit Companion for the nicest Christian;
ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="533" facs="tcp:59888:207"/>
These are all Vertues of no common size; yet 'tis very
possible he may fail of that Reward you expect for
him in time, and meet a more ample Reward in a
Place where Time shall have nothing to do; nor
can he lose by that, even in this World, <hi>for Vertue
is its own Reward and End.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis a surprizing Character you give of Doctor
<hi>Phoenix!</hi> I know not whether such another will
<hi>spring out of his Ashes?</hi> To be modest and humble,
ascribing all his Success to God, and to impart his
Skill to the Poor for Charity, are Vertues the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of our <hi>Physitians</hi> are Strangers to; and tho'
they pretend to rail at <hi>Quacks,</hi> they have both one
aim; which is more at their Patients Purses, and
their <hi>own Fame</hi> and <hi>Reputations,</hi> than the Health
and Recovery the sick Party gives their Money
for.</p>
                  <p>Tho' I acknowledge the <hi>force of Imagination</hi> to
be very great, I can't conceive how <hi>two such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
should be so transported, as one to fancy the
Story, and the other the Circumstances to support
it; nor, is there <hi>any thing incredible in the whole
Relation,</hi> attested by two such Persons as you repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
'em: The Lady's Courage was the most surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
part of the Story; but I confess it would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
confirm or destroy the <hi>Doctrine of Baptizing
Children</hi> with me, as I believe it <hi>was the Devil;</hi>
what he teaches is of little weight, his <hi>Policies are so
refined,</hi> 'tis hard to guess at his Designs; but to be
sure, his intent is always to deceive; and then most
certainly, when he most contradict<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest.
I <hi>wonder at the Dean's so slightly imputing it
to the force of Imagination,</hi> unless he's of the same
Mind with a Minister I once discoursed with; who
deny'd <hi>the Devils Power to possess any Persons:</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
many Instances I alledged out of the
<hi>New Testament,</hi> he affirm'd all those were only
<hi>Lunatic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s.</hi> I was much surpriz'd at such an <hi>auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciousness</hi>
against such plain Scripture! Cou'd I find
the like for <hi>Souls entering into Bodies</hi> after they
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:59888:208"/>
have cast 'em off, I should not generally impute
<hi>all Apparitions to the Devil,</hi> as I do. Not that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
they enter into Bodies to appear in, but that
we only are deceived with the <hi>appearance of a Body;</hi>
for in this case the Persons had been dead so long,
their Bodies must needs be corrupted. I believe as
well, in <hi>some special occasions, God sends his Angels</hi>
still, as he did formerly, in humane Shapes, to
warn or protect his Servants from some dangers;
but not to <hi>take upon 'em the Persons of the Dead,</hi> to
teach or confirm any point of Faith or Doctrine;
I never found any thing in Scripture to countenance
such an Opinion. If <hi>Imagination</hi> had such a Power
over the Lady as the Dean pretended to think, to
save his giving <hi>Sentence in a case so difficult;</hi> (tho' who
knows but he did believe so in reality?) that <hi>pretty
Robin</hi> had been a subject proper to delude her, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Qualities so much above his kind. I wish,
when the Bird dies, the <hi>Devil don't take its shape,</hi>
and visit the Lady again, she gave him so kind
an Entertainment in the Person of her <hi>Vncle.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Libraries</hi> appear much greater in the Eyes of the
World, in my Opinion, <hi>then indeed they are;</hi> we
think we have a great Treasure there of the
Thoughts of Men, but <hi>the multitude</hi> of those
Thoughts shews the weakness of 'em. What need
so much be said? If they were all agreed upon the
Truth, <hi>one Demonstration would reduce all the rest
to silence,</hi> and bring Knowledge to a much narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Compass. I take that to be the Curse that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd
to the Soul of Man; that as his <hi>Body was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
to labour, and the Earth at the same time to
bring forth Thornes and Thistles,</hi> so his Mind should
have a continual thirst and desire after Knowledge,
and be constantly deceiv'd with appearances. Yet
what can be more proper to humble Man for his
first Presumption, when it brings him at last to see
and acknowledge his own Weakness and Ignorance,
and to find, after all his Pains in <hi>humane Learning,</hi>
there's no true Knowledge but that which <hi>David</hi>
                     <pb n="535" facs="tcp:59888:208"/>
found in the <hi>study of Gods Law,</hi> which made him
wiser than the Aged?</p>
                  <p>I hope you will not be startled at this <hi>stupendious
temerity</hi> of a foolish Woman; 'tis my sence, which
I have your leave to own upon every occasion you
give me; and I find some countenance to this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in the <hi>first Volume of the Port Royal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whatever I think of the <hi>vast Curiosity of
Books and Libraries,</hi> I am no Enemy to the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious;
for I allow <hi>fine Buildings and Gardens</hi> can't
be better bestow'd, than on such; the labours of
the Mind require that Pleasure; it goes as far as
any thing that's humane, towards the inspiring
great and noble Thoughts; the Body can't be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
such innocent Pleasure, while the hardship of
Study debars it of so many other.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dyal placed on the Pile of Books,</hi> perfectly
shews us the boundless Curiosity of humane Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
it was labour in vain; not that he could
not do what he proposed; But for what good was
it? <hi>He did it because he could do it,</hi> and that the
World should know so much; like those that
make it the only end of their Study, to be reputed
Learned.</p>

                  <p>In your Character of Collonel <hi>Butler,</hi> there is
nothing wanting to a very accomplish'd Person;
and perhaps the <hi>innocent Recreation</hi> he allow'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
of <hi>Painting</hi> in the intervals of his Study, as it
contributed a great deal of Pleasure, so much of his
Vertue might be owing to that <hi>happy Genius</hi> that
fill'd up his vacant Hours, and gave him neither
Leisure nor Inclination to seek the occasions of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
in Places of <hi>Vice and Idleness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I perceive the <hi>Art of Painting</hi> is affected amongst

but he was no great Artist then, he may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd since.</p>
                  <p>The Collonel's <hi>Humility</hi> you admir'd so much, is
very often the effect of a <hi>Great and Noble Education,</hi>
that, whatever there is within, fails not to appear

                  <p>I wish the <hi>Lord Mayors of England</hi> would emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
those in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and by their good Deeds
furnish matter to the <hi>News Letters</hi> of Applause,
and our Poets would not be out-done by the <hi>Irish
in Congratulatory Poems.</hi> I confess, I think it
strange, that as they are generally rich Men, and
have so great opportunity of doing good, and
whatever trouble it gives 'em, <hi>'tis but for one year,</hi>
that they should not use all their effort to reform,
as much as possible, all the Abuses in the City, of
which they themselves might reap the benefit so
many years after; with the Prayers, Applause,
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:59888:209"/>
and Blessings of all the Persons concern'd. And why
they should not every one <hi>exceed his Successor,</hi> by
the Experience he might get from the others <hi>Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
no reason can be given; unless, because they
are rich Men, who have been so used to draw all
Fish to their own Nets, they can think of nothing
else but meer <hi>Lord Mayors, and Iustices of the

have it much in their Power to give this Kingdom

                  <p>I perceive you are much taken up with the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation

                  </p>
                  <p>You lay great stress, and not without Reason,
upon <hi>performing of Promises;</hi> but I see no reason
why that should be <hi>more damnable</hi> than other Sins
as mischievous; if the Person <hi>promis'd with a design
to deceive,</hi> never intending to perform it, 'tis a
great and presumptuous Sin; but Repentance is
the Remedy for that, as well as the <hi>least Sin, which
is no less dangerous without it;</hi> as also when a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
promises, and for their Interest forbears Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
because it is to their own Injury, <hi>'tis not safe
to live or die in such a Sin of Self-love and Injustice;</hi>
nothing can secure 'em but Repentance, and only
such a one as repairs the Injury. But 'tis possible to
make a Promise with a full intent to perform, yet
afterwards want the Power; or the Promise may
be of such a Nature, that not performing may be
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:59888:210"/>
rather an Advantage than Injury to the Person inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to; both these cases lessens the <hi>Crime,</hi> and
makes it rather a Misfortune to have promised,

                  <p>You was well advised, not to discompose your
Temper with the Thoughts of your Enemies, till
you had taken <hi>leave of your Friends;</hi> and if you
had left 'em out of your Thoughts still, it had
been no great harm: But you think their Crimes
deserve Chastisement; and the <hi>Iustice you owe to
your Reputation,</hi> obliges to the exposing such
Men.</p>
                  <p>What need you ask Pardon for your <hi>own Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter</hi>
amongst the rest? It had been an unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable
Fault, to pretend to know every one
you convers'd with <hi>a few Moments, and not know
your self,</hi> with whom you have convers'd so
long: Besides, 'tis using them as you use your

<pb n="539" facs="tcp:59888:210"/>
as you have your own, is, that they <hi>conceal'd
'em from you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There's great Reason for laying the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of your <hi>chief Perfection upon your descent
from the Tribe of Levi;</hi> for according to St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
they are, or should be, <hi>the Men that Rule their
own Houses well, having their Children in Subjection
with all Gravity;</hi> for tho' Grace comes not by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent,
yet by a sober and vertuous Education, the
Enemies of Grace are so far disarm'd, that when it
pleases God to send it, it must needs have the
better Reception; <hi>a long habit of Submission and
Self-denyal,</hi> will qualifie 'em to act more readily
to Gods Glory, than those that are over-loaded
with the evil Customs and Corruptions of the
World.</p>
                  <p>I can't think but 'tis the happy Success of being
<hi>so agreeable to both your Wives,</hi> makes you so in
love with the <hi>State of Marriage,</hi> so inconsistent
with your great love and <hi>fancy'd Destiny to Travel;</hi>
of which I think with you, that the chief Pleasure
is, <hi>of seeing the World unseen; not being known, but
guest at.</hi> I fancy therefore, the Project you design
to call <hi>The Art of Living Incognito,</hi> will be very
pleasant; but to publish the <hi>Characters of your
Living Acquaintance,</hi> will be a great and difficult
Task, especially for you that are so <hi>very scrupulous</hi>
of doing the least Injustice; many Persons <hi>Words,
Looks, and Actions,</hi> belie their Hearts; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an infallible Rule, of which I know nothing,
you will at least be thought to err, there being no
means to prove the contrary; and tho' you should
incline to the most <hi>charitable side,</hi> Truth is the
same in both, and there's the <hi>same Injustice to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
as discommend,</hi> where they don't deserve it;
besides the danger of creating amongst your Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
much Envy and Uncharitableness, there
must appear in all your Words and Actions, an
<hi>excessive Charity,</hi> and <hi>exact Iustice,</hi> to take off any
suspition of your being acted by Prejudice or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality:
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:59888:211"/>
If any thing can secure you, it must be the
<hi>Persons being all Living,</hi> to whom you must an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
for any wrong you do 'em; and from those
you commend, your Pardon is secur'd against all
Accusers, but only <hi>Truth, which condemns if inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:</hi>
But sure, the <hi>Characters of the Living</hi> are
much to be preferr'd before those of the <hi>Dead;</hi> we
see plainly, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

How are all the <hi>good Deeds of the Vertuous</hi>
heightned, one would think there were nothing of
Sin or Infirmity in 'em? And for the Vicious, their
Cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mes are exagerated, they scarce allow 'em the
least degree of humane Vertues: But if the World
were as much in love with Truth, as it were to
be wish'd, there might be good use of such <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters;</hi>
and Persons would as willingly see the
<hi>Pictures of their Minds, as of their Faces,</hi> and be as
fond of making 'em worth the drawing.</p>
                  <p>But to find Persons willing themselves to <hi>publish
and expose their own Faults and Infirmities,</hi> we may
expect in the next Age, if it brings the <hi>Reign of
Charity</hi> according to Monsieur <hi>Iurie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

till then, tho' you set the Example; but for Vices,
they are too monstrous and deform'd, to dare the
exposing themselves in <hi>a full Light;</hi> for which I
thank 'em, for I hate the sight of 'em.</p>
                  <p>I perceive you think you have <hi>many Enemies</hi>
upon account of Religion, because you favour no
<hi>particular Party;</hi> 'tis certain, in any Place where
there are many Factions and Divisions, none are
so generally hated as those that <hi>carry fair with all,</hi>
and take part with none; and that<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

one knows from whence they come, having none
of the Effect and Power of that <hi>Religion that comes
from above, which is first Pure, and then Peaceable.
Sincerity and Charity is the surest Mark of Christian
Religion.</hi> 'Twere much to be wish'd, all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches were united in the Spirit of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:59888:211"/>
then, and not till then, we may expect the
<hi>Inlargement of Christ's Kingdom;</hi> while at this day
so many falls from us to <hi>Atheism,</hi> seeing so much
of self-interest, and the spirit of the World, in the
strictest and most formal Professors amongst us;
and 'tis to them a Temptation to believe there is
nothing but <hi>secular Interest</hi> in that which we call
Religion, in which there is so much Contention to
raise themselves one above another in Riches and
Honour; this is what many sees and laments, and
wishes they themselves may see before 'tis too
late.</p>
                  <p>They can be but meer <hi>Pretenders to Religion,</hi>
that allow themselves lightly to censure or judge
any one; for both <hi>Charity and Humility</hi> forbids
such a Practice; we see our <hi>own depraved Nature
in every bodies Faults, which ought to humble us with
Sorrow for 'em, as if they were our own;</hi> and that
will prevent, if we have the least charitable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
for others, our being pleased or desirous to
see Faults, and divulge those we can't chuse but
see; for no Faults can in Charity be expos'd, that
has the least pretence to Infirmity: Your carriage
therefore to your Adversary, was <hi>exceeding Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
and charitable, and make his Faults such as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
to be exposed as a foil to Vertue, if it
needed any, which I scorn to think; for <hi>I am an
equal Rival with you in the love of Vertue,</hi> as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
only to my Mind; but were it to be <hi>seen with
bodily Eyes,</hi> I fear I should come far behind you.
'Tis a very laudable design you carry on, of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
Vertue, by giving such <hi>noble and pleasant
Ideas of it in the Characters you make;</hi> and sure it
cannot want Success in all respects; there must
certainly be some Persons 'twill prevail upon; as
in St. <hi>Cicelies Ode,</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>See what Glory can perswade</l>
                        <l>Those that are for Glory made,</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="542" facs="tcp:59888:212"/>
May be here apply'd to Vertue; but whatever is
the Fate, you are always happy, while so <hi>resign'd
to the Divine Pleasure:</hi> An easie and contented
Temper is a great Blessing. But why should you
value your self for being a <hi>blunt Fellow?</hi> Can't eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one be master of that Vertue, if they like it?
And why disdain ye the <hi>Name of a Poet, only for
being Poor?</hi> Is there such Vertue in being Rich?
What reason can be assign'd for such an inevitable
Fate, unless 'tis the <hi>Effect of Fancy;</hi> which, as it
raises their Thoughts and Expressions far above the
Truth, so it raises themselves <hi>in Imagination, to the
Condition of Angels,</hi> that need nothing; which makes
'em take care for nothing, till 'tis too late? Or,
perhaps Divine Providence will not trust such
Men with <hi>a Talent of Riches, who so idly throw
away their Talent of Time,</hi> which is far more
precious.</p>
                  <p>Yet after all, you seem to own you treat your
Friends with <hi>Distinction, some from the Brain, and
others from the Heart;</hi> but 'tis not easie to judge of
this part of your Character, tho' I dare affirm you
never deceive others, till you have <hi>first deceiv'd
your self.</hi> I believe 'tis very hard, and must be the
work of time, exactly to determine this distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
yet one would think <hi>a Heart that lies open,
could not fail to be known, both to it self, and others;</hi>
but according to the <hi>Italian</hi> Proverb, <hi>He that builds
his House in the Street, 'tis either too high, or too
low.</hi> So a Man that should have no better means
of knowing himself, than what he may get from
the Light and Testimony of others, may be as
much a Stranger to what he truly is, as the Men
in great Power and Riches, <hi>that feed upon Flattery,</hi>
as well of their own, as others, must needs <hi>frame
an Idea of themselves,</hi> very different from what they
really are.</p>
                  <p>Tho' 'tis nothing strange the generality of the
World should not <hi>court your Friendship,</hi> in respect
to your love to Truth, and speaking <hi>freely of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:59888:212"/>
Faults;</hi> but it would be very strange, if that
Person should not have <hi>one Friend in the World,</hi>
that has one of the best Qualifications for it. To
have ones Faults truly and sincerely told one by
ones Friend in Charity, is an advantage nothing in
this World can equal; and of great value to those
that understand it, and is what you have the most
reason, of any one, to prize; for if <hi>any thing fix
your Mercury, cure your Rashness, and save your
repenting of every thing you do,</hi> it must be the Light
and Counsel of a Friend. I can't hinder my self
from thinking, that <hi>your never repenting of taking
two Women for better for worse,</hi> was the Effect of a
very good and wise Friend's Counsel; what else
could make you do a thing so extraordinary, when
so contrary to your natural Practise? But to take
a little from this <hi>great Miracle,</hi> perhap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>And yet after all, you must pardon me, if I
don't think you <hi>as fit to make a Friend as any Man;</hi>
for he that is a single Man, and chuses to be so, is
fitter; For what must your Wife do, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

give all to your Friend? And a Man <hi>more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
qualified,</hi> is fitter; for he may be suited in the
Temper of a Friend; but where can you be <hi>match'd
in Fidelity, Compassion, and Generosity?</hi> You may
expect that return of Love and Gratitude; (for who
can chuse but love such Qualities?) But yet the Love
that you describe, which Crimes can't deface, is
as transcendent as all the rest; and if you think it
<hi>just to slight what loves not as much as your self,</hi> I
wish you may, 'tis pity you should not; but I
fear you never will be suited with a Friend. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
blame your not being forward in <hi>contracting
Friendships,</hi> 'tis so uncertain how they may prove;
but to <hi>a long and try'd Fidelity,</hi> I own all to be due
that you propose in your Friendship.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>exactness of your Rules in Traffick and Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
is of very good Example; there are few lay
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:59888:213"/>
that stress upon it they ought; there's more of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in it than is generally consider'd, while their
Thoughts are taken up with the <hi>love of Gain.</hi> You
have a great Happiness in sitting so loose from the
love of Money, and yet retain <hi>so just a value for it,</hi> as
to make the proper use of it.</p>
                  <p>I don't see you have <hi>commended your self</hi> so much
in your Character as needs either <hi>Apology or Pardon;</hi>
the Glory you assume in <hi>point of Friendship,</hi> you have
