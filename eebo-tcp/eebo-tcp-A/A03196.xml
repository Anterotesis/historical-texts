            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And therefore commendable was that law amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> which admitted funerall orations to be openly delivered at the obsequies of any grave and modest matron, to animate and incourage the living, who by imitating their excellent indowments and departments, might be partakers with them in

               <p>Which words greatly pleased <hi>Olofernes,</hi> and his servants, who marvelled at her wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and said, there is no such woman in the world, both for beauty and wisdome: Moreover <hi>Olofernes</hi> replyed,<note place="margin">The answer of <hi>Olofernes.</hi>

and her maide went and spread forth her skinnes on the ground, over against the place where <hi>Olofernes</hi> sate, whose heart was ravished, and his spirits mooved, and hee greatly desired her company, for he waited to insidiate her chastity, from the day that he had first seene her, who said unto her, drinke now and be merry with us: who answered and saide,<note place="margin">Shee eateth and drinketh in the presence of <hi>Olofernes.</hi>

               <p>The evening being come, his servants made haste to depart, and <hi>Bagoas</hi> shut his Tent without, and dismissed all from the presence of his Lord, but <hi>Iudeth</hi> was left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in the tent, and <hi>Olofernes</hi> was stretched upon his bed, for the feast had beene long, and hee was filled with much wine.

his sack-cloth from him, but he received it not, then the Queene called <hi>Hatach</hi> the Eunuch, and gave him a commandement to goe unto <hi>Mordecai,</hi> and to know of him, what and why such things were? so <hi>Hatach</hi> went forth and met him at the gate, to whom <hi>Mordecai</hi> punctually related all that had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, even to the least circumstance, and gave him the coppy of the writing, to shew unto <hi>Esther,</hi>

Which having heard, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded what honour, or what dignity had beene done unto him for that service? to whom it was answered by his servants that nothing at all had beene done for him:<note place="margin">Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> He thinking it most unworthy his imperiall dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to receive so great a benefit as his life, and not to reward it, asking what one of note was in the Court? (now <hi>Haman</hi> was newly come into the Inner Court of the Kings pallace, to speake unto him that <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai</hi> might be hanged on the tree which he had prepared for him) and his servants said, <hi>Haman</hi> standeth in the Court, and the King said, let him come in, who no sooner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before him, but <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> spake unto him and said: what shall be done unto the man whom the King will honour? then
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:4225:40"/>
                  <hi>Haman</hi> thinking in his heart, to whom would the King doe honour more then to my selfe? answered. To him whom the King will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, let them bring forth Royall apparell,<note place="margin">Pride catcht in her owne net.</note> such as the King useth to weare, and the Horse on which hee rideth, and let the Crowne Royall be set upon his head, and let the rayment and the Horse be delivered by the hand of one of the Kings most noble Princes, and let them apparel the man whom the King will honour, and cause him to ride upon the Horse through the City, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clame before him, saying: thus shall it be done unto the man whom the King will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
               <p>Then said the King to <hi>Haman,</hi> goe speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and take the rayment and the Horse, (as thou haste saide) with the royall Crowne and doe so unto <hi>Mordecai</hi> the Iew,<note place="margin">The case is altered with <hi>Haman.</hi>

Then were the Kings Scribes called who wrote according to al that <hi>Mordecai</hi> did dictate unto them, unto the Iewes and to the Princes, and Captaines, and Governours of the Provinces, which were from <hi>India</hi> even unto <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> an hundred and seven and twenty Provinces, and unto every Province in such Letters and Language as was used a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the people, that lived therein, which having sealed with the Kings Ring, he sent them by posts on Horsebacke, and those that rode upon beasts of price, as <hi>Dromidaries,</hi> and <hi>Mules,</hi>

               <p>Then <hi>Mordecai</hi> went out from the King in Royall apparell,<note place="margin">

               <p>Now when this Decree grew neare to be put in execution, in the day that their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hoped to have power over them. It is worthy observation, that Gods great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, turneth the joy of the wicked into sorrow, and the teares of the godly into glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, for the Iewes gathered themselves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into their Cities, throughout all the Dominions of King <hi>Abasuerus,</hi> to lay hands on such as sought their dammage, and no man durst withstand them, for the feare of them fell upon all the people, and the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the Provinces, Princes, Captaines, and Officers of the King, Exalted the Iewes, did them honour and showed them friendship, for the feare of Queene <hi>Esther</hi> and <hi>Mordecai</hi> was upon them.

Thus the Iewes smote all their enemies with the sword,<note place="margin">The Iewes revenged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</note> with slaughter, and destruction, and what seemed pleasing in their owne eyes unto all those who had conspired their death, by the instigation of wicked <hi>Haman:</hi> At <hi>Shushan</hi> they slew five hundred men, as

also the ten sonnes of <hi>Haman,</hi> but they laid not their hands on the spoyle, and their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was brought unto the King.</p>
               <p>Who said unto Queene <hi>Esther,</hi> thy people have slaine in <hi>Shushan</hi> the pallace, five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men, and the ten sonnes of <hi>Haman,</hi> what have they done in the rest of the Provinces? and what is thy petition further, that it may be given thee? or what is thy request more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that it may be performed unto thee? then said <hi>Esther,</hi> if it please the King, let it be granted also, that they may hang upon the tree,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Hamans</hi> ten sonnes, and the King gave present order that it should be so done. The Iewes also that were in <hi>Shushan,</hi> assembled themselves upon the foureteenth day of the moneth <hi>Adar,</hi> and slew of their enemies three hundred men, but they laid not their hands on the spoyle, and the rest of the Iewes that were in the Kings provinces, assembled themselves and stood up for their lives, and slew them that hated them, seventy and five thousand, but on the spoyle laid they no hand.
