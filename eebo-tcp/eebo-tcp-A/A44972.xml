            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE POWER OF PARLIAMENTS Aſſerted, In ANSWER to a LETTER from a Gentleman of Quality to his Friend, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>SIR, if <hi>E. F.</hi> had kept himſelf ſtrictly to his Task, premiſed in the Title Page: namely, of the great difficulty, which is the true meaning of his two <hi>Epithets</hi> of <hi>Improbable</hi> and <hi>Impoſſible</hi> of barring the Right Line in the Succeſſion; I ſhould have acquieſt, knowing it to be a great Truth, but when, in the height of his Zeal to the Cauſe, he admits of a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Law to that purpoſe, yet he invalidates it, as he would have the Nation believe, to all intents and purpoſes: his Reaſons for that, Worthy Sir, may be worthy Conſideration; the Steps that he makes towards it, are in my Opinion not very congruous to his deſigned End, which muſt be ſubmitted to the ſcrutiny of your more diſcerning Judgment.</p>
            <p>He begins firſt with the Statute of the Queen about Succeſſion. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall, after the Death</hi>
               <note place="margin">13 Eliz. C.</note> 
               <hi>of the Queen, affirm, That the Parliament of</hi> England <hi>hath not full Power to bind the Crown in Point of Deſcent or Succeſſion, ſhall Forfeit his Goods and Chattels.</hi> Which he very Learnedly ſays, Doth not affect a Member of the Commons, becauſe he is ſo, neither doth it affect any other Perſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its natural for any Member freely to adviſe with his Friend about it, with mutual ſafety: and to prove the latter, I ſuppoſe, he tells us what irrefragable Records of Parliament he hath peruſed, that the Members of the Commons in Ancient time, have ſometimes demurred to Paſs certain Bills of extraordinary nature, till they had conſulted their Countreys they ſerved for. And then ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ill Nature to the Statute of <hi>Eliz.</hi> he goes on, and tells us, he hopes his Friend will find he hath Stabb'd it <hi>into the Fifth Rib,</hi> a man that had not Studied to forget Scripture, as the Wicked <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Antiochus</hi>'s time, endeavoured to Uncircumciſe themſelves, would have ſaid <hi>under,</hi> or <hi>in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53416:3"/>
the Fifth Rib,</hi> but why ſhould he be quarrell'd with, for his unskilfulneſs in Scripture Language, when he is ſo notoriouſly out in other matters: he tells his Friend, he hath ſearched Records, but that may be queſtioned, when his miſtakes about that Statute are ſo groſs, for the Words are not as he gives e'm. <hi>If any ſhall after the Death of the Queen,</hi> &amp;c. but they are, <hi>If any ſhall, during the Queens life, Claim Right to the Crown,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Or affirm, That the Laws and Statutes of this Realm do not bind the Right of the Crown, and the Deſcent, Government and Limitation thereof,</hi> &amp;c. Yet though they are Printed in an <hi>Italick</hi> Character, as all expir'd Statutes are, he makes ſo many impertinent flouriſhes and inferences about his own Senſe in the matter, that there is no room to lay any fault upon the Printer; yet it may be theſe miſtakes ariſes from his not truſting the Printed Statutes, becauſe ſometimes faulty, but applying himſelf to the Record, which, for want of skill in that <hi>Obſolete</hi> Hand, cauſed theſe miſtakes; yet from what he ſays, no man knows what meaſures to take, for having afterwards occaſion to have another bout at that Terrible Statute, at the end of his Letter, he makes it talk at another Rate.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman you ſee hath but ill luck in his preliminary Attaque, how he behaves himſelf af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, is now to be examined, he lays down for his <hi>Maxim,</hi> That <hi>Parliament of</hi> England <hi>cannot by their Act Exclude or Diſable the next Heir of Blood Royal from Succeſſion to the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi>
               <note place="margin">g. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Crown of this Nation,</hi> when he hath made out that—<hi>Erit mihi magnus</hi> Apollo. For this aſſertion, he gives ſeveral Reaſons, ſuch as they are.</p>
            <p>For his firſt Reaſon, he alledges, <hi>That the Succeſſion to the Crown is unſeparably annexed to proximity of Blood by the Laws of God and Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Statute Laws contrarient to thoſe, are Null and Voyd.</hi> To make good his firſt Reaſon, he offers at the 27 of <hi>Numb.</hi> which he calls the Statute Law, which God himſelf pronounced for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the deſcent of Honors and Poſſeſſions, (to uſe the Authors own Words,) but to ſo little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as I am ſorry he lyes under the ſuſpicion of being an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man.</p>
            <p>For the firſt part of that Chapter Treats onely about directions concerning the diſpoſal of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of <hi>Zelophehads</hi> Daughters, which ſhould be a ſtanding Rule or <hi>a Statute of Judgment to the Children of</hi> Iſrael. The latter part gives an Account about nominating a Succeſſor to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Kingdom or chief Magiſtracy, upon Gods giving him an Accompt of his approaching Death, in which as may appear by the Text, proximity of Blood was not at all regarded, for though <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> in probability had Sons, becauſe no account of their Deaths, however he had Nephews, yet <hi>Joſhuah</hi> the Son of <hi>Nun,</hi> all others ſet aſide; was preferred for his Graces and excellent Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>thou ſhalt put ſome of thine Honour upon him, that all the Congregation of the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>may be Obedient.</hi> Is not this a ſpecial Text to prove deſcent of Honours, according to Proximity of Blood? but I conclude no great matters from that practiſe againſt this Champion for Succeſſion by Blood, neither indeed is any part of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, whether Judicial or Ceremonial, at all Argumentative in our Circumſtances, for if the Statute about <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lophehads</hi> Daughters was as binding as the Moral Law, then wo worth all Tenants in <hi>Copy-hold</hi> or <hi>Borough Engliſh</hi> for evermore; From hence he goes on to other Scripture Preſidents, to as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle purpoſe, and then falls a citing of Fathers to leſs, for what inference can be made to affect the force of our Laws from any thing the Fathers have ſaid about Government?</p>
            <p>From thence, to confirm and fortify this his firſt reaſon, he had recourſe to <hi>Bodin</hi> a <hi>French</hi>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who argues ſtrongly for the deſcent upon the Iſſue Male of the next of Blood, <hi>Sic enim ordo non tantum natura &amp; Divinae Legis ſed etiam omnium ubique gentium poſtulat,</hi> for ſo, ſays he, not only the Order of Nature and Divine Right, but of all Nations do require it. Anotable Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate for the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> who claim by the Female, Then he falls to Cite a Company of <hi>Civilians</hi> with hard Names, as pertinent to his Deſign, as if he had <hi>Prayed Aid</hi> from the <hi>Jewiſh Talmud,</hi> or the Old <hi>Arabian</hi> Doctors, but at laſt, as if he was Conſcious of ſome miſtakes, he is content to leave the Argument to Civilians and Divines, who are as proper for it, <hi>quatenus</hi> ſo, as ſuch, as the Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi> and Court of Aldermen.</p>
            <p>Now he falls into an Heroick Harangue, and tells us it is moſt Evident, but how, he hath not told yet, <hi>that all the Humane Acts and Powers in the World, cannot hinder the deſcent of the Crown upon the next Heir of Blood,</hi> to make this out, he tells you of <hi>Watſons</hi> Caſe, <hi>of the Kings never dying,</hi> as if limiting the Succeſſion would alter it: After all, he takes a great deal of pains
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53416:3"/>
to prove Allegiance due to Kings, from the form of the Indictments for high Treaſon, as if any Body in their right Wits would deny it.</p>
            <p>Now he falls to a very confident but undue concluding the Queſtion, and ſays, as the Common Law is more worthy than the Statute Law, ſo the Law of Nature is more worthy than that, from thence he Tryumphantly concludes, <hi>no Humane Power can hinder the deſcent upon the Right Heir of the Crown.</hi> Becauſe Allegiance to the King is due by the Law of Nature, as he proves by the forms of the Indictments before ſpoken of, which no body will deny, though they cannot agree with <hi>E. F.</hi> in the Concluſion, as being too foreign to the point, eſpecially when it is obvious, how that every day both the Common Law and the Law of Nature are impos'd upon, and ſet aſide by the Statute Law in ſomething or other; for the firſt it is known to every little Pettiſogger, to the latter I ſhall ſpeak hereafter: This Common Law, that he, ſo much without all reaſon cryes up, as if he had by ſome Vow abandon'd the Divine faculty of the Soul, as People do when they turn Papiſts, received its vigor from a meaner Power, than the Statute Law, for it had its Sanction from the Conqueror alone, who had right here, neither by God nor Nature. In the preamble to the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of St. <hi>Edwards</hi> Laws, which he made the Fourth of his Reign, you may find theſe Words, <hi>Electi igitur de ſingulis totius patriae comitatibus vir. duodecem quo <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>

               <note place="margin">Sp. Gloſ. L. 1. C. 6.</note> 
               <hi>nec ad dextram nec adſinistram divertentes Legum ſuarum, &amp; conſuetudinum ſancita pate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facerent nihil praetermittentes, nil addentes, nil praevaricando mutantes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Twelve men of every County being choſen, did firſt make Oath before the King, that to their Power, they would without any deviation to the right hand, or the left, diſcover the Sanction of their Laws and Cuſtoms, pretermitting nothing, adding nothing changing by prevarication, the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners made their return, and the practice hath gone ſince accordingly, but when the Statute Law breaks in upon it, and for the better eaſe and inſtruction of the People, they were turned into <hi>French.</hi> This was the Original and Growth of the Common Law, ſo Sacred with my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</p>
            <p>Yet <hi>E. F.</hi> miſtruſting I ſuppoſe, the efficacy of what he has ſaid, ſhuffles all off to the Law of Nature, about which he had been nibbling a little all along, and declares it not abrogable by any Humane Power, and from thence concludes an incapability of diſheriſon by Parliament, as being but a Humane Power; Then the Gentleman falls on to Illuſtrate his <hi>Dogmatiſmes</hi> by Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of our own Stories to as little purpoſe as the reſt; He tells you that the Second <hi>William</hi> U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped upon <hi>Robert</hi> his Elder Brother, which cannot be Granted, for <hi>William</hi> claimed by virtue of the Conquerors Will, who (after the example of the Patriarch <hi>Jacob,</hi> who gave to <hi>Joſeph</hi> his younger Son, the Land which he had taken with his Sword and his Bow) gave his younger Son, his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Acquiſition: 'tis true <hi>Robert</hi> made a buſtle, but all was compounded for 3000 marks <hi>per Annum</hi> at preſent and the Crown in reverſion: now though the Intrinſick value of that Summ be much more than ſo much now, yet it falls far ſhort of any thing like a valuable compenſation. To clear now the Uſurpation of <hi>William</hi> the Second, I offer this Foreign Story<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Alphonſo</hi> of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon</hi> Conquered the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> and gave it to his baſe Son <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> his lawful Son Succeeded him in the Crown of <hi>Arragon, Sicill, Ferdinands</hi> Poſterity enjoyed it, without any imputation of Uſurpation by any Writers of that or any ſucceeding Age, until they were expuls'd by the <hi>French</hi> Arms, the Treachery of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> concurring.</p>
            <p>Then he tells you, without any regard to Truth, though it be to no purpoſe, of the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>H.</hi> the II. in whom the <hi>Saxon</hi> line was reſtor'd, as he faith, his Grandmother being the next Heir to <hi>Edgar Atheling:</hi> which all that knows Hiſtory, muſt conclude a notorious untruth, for <hi>Edgar</hi> King of <hi>Scotland</hi> was Brother uterine to that Lady, whoſe Poſterity is yet undetermin'd, this Gentleman by theſe petty remarks, I ſuppoſe, will put in for a compurgatour at the Tryal of the next Traytors, being as well qualifyed as any Young man of St. <hi>Omers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From thence, after ſome impertinent digreſſion, concerning the Multitude of men, kill'd in the Civil Wars 'twixt <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> he comes to Records, which he ſeems to ſet a great value up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and tells us, That the entayl of the Crown upon <hi>H.</hi> 4. and his Heirs, was over ruled by <hi>Rich.</hi> Duke of <hi>Yorks</hi> Friends; and gives you the Words <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> and likewiſe tells you it had the ſame Succeſs under <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. and from thence Magiſterially concludes, <hi>That a Title of that Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and Grandeur is not at all impeachable even by Act of Parliament.</hi> Now any man of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe would have given another reaſon, than the ſublimity of the Title to have defeated that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53416:4"/>
Act, namely, the incompetency of the Parliament that paſt it, being not rightly Conſtituted, as not Conven'd by a Legal Authority, under a Lawful King, that was the true reaſon of its faileur, though others may be fancyed, which more fully appears from the invalidity of all the Acts of Parliament by the Three <hi>Henryes,</hi> till Confirm'd in <hi>Edward</hi> the IV. time, as may appear by<note place="margin">

            <p>Now further to confirm what he would be at, he puts a modeſt Caſe of the King and his Three Eſtates, for thats the natural meaning of the Word <hi>Parliament,</hi> of paſſing an Act, that no man ſhould Honour the King or Love his Parents or Children, or give Alms to the Poor, or pey Tithes to the Parſon of the Pariſh, it would be Void in it ſelf, as</p>
            <p>The better to adjuſt his two later Examples, he Cites <hi>Doctor</hi> and <hi>Student,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">L. 1. C. 6.</note> and 21 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 2. but ſtill according to his wonted ingenuity, for the Doctors Words there are, <hi>if it were Ordained, that no Almes ſhould be given for no neceſſity, the Cuſtom and Statute were void,</hi> yet he with the ſame Wind determines, that the Statute of 23 of <hi>Edw.</hi> III. ſince repealed, which forbad, under the Penalty of ImPriſonment, every man to give Almes to any Valiant Beggers, as he terms them (which I ſuppoſe were the Words of the Statute) that may well labour, that ſo they may be compelled to labour for their Living, <hi>to be a good Statute, for it obſerved the intent of the Law of God,</hi> there is a later ſince made, that ſo modifies Almes giving, that it is not to be done at all times and all places under a penalty: ſo that Authority makes nothing for his Caſe, his other is like 151 Pſalm. no ſuch thing in being, for the laſt Act of <hi>H.</hi> 7. was in the 19 of his Reign as may appear by the Printed Statute, which paſſes in all Courts for Record and <hi>uncontraverſable</hi> Evidence.</p>
            <p>Then Dictator like, he concludes, after all this foiſting, that he hath proved his two firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, <hi>That the Succeſſion of the Crown in</hi> England, <hi>is inſeparably annexed to Proximity of Blood, by the Laws of God and Nature, and that Statutes contrarient to ſuch are Voyd, from whence</hi> it neceſſarily follows, <hi>as he ſays. That the Heir of the Blood Royal, cannot be barr'd from Succeſſion by Parliament,</hi> what need he now ſay any more? but being ſatisfied, I ſuppoſe, of proving nothing all this while, he goes on to his ſecond Reaſon. <hi>That the Succeſſion of the Crown to the next Heir of Blood, is a Fundamental Conſtitution;</hi> to confirm this now, which no body will deny, he Cites Sir <hi>Edward Cooke,</hi> but now, whither that or any other Fundamental, or any thing ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, be not alterable by Parliament, is the Queſtion, about which Words the Gentleman ſeems to be fallacious, for if by that Word, he means only the major of Lords and Commons, excluding the King, as he ſeems to do, by ſo ſlightly ſpeaking of their Power, he is in the right, but if by Parliament, he means as the Law means, he is (as I hope to make it appear) miſtaken, now he would run down the reaſonableneſs of their Authority, from Conſequences, for if ſays he, <hi>a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament may alter ſuch a Conſtitution, then the Monarchy of</hi> England <hi>will become Elective in a ſhort ſpace:</hi> but why, he does not ſo much as offer at, but he ſays it, and thats enough, well, if it ſhould be Elective; as long as all parties concern'd are agreed, no ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, I hope: <hi>Poland</hi> is an Example in this Caſe, which became an Elective Kingdom, from Deſpotical, upon the fayling of the Poſterity of <hi>Crocus</hi> in <hi>Popielus</hi> the ſecond; as <hi>Denmark</hi> hath of late by conſent of their Eſtates, become an Hereditary, from an Elective <hi>Monarchy,</hi> but nothing of that can be here, without the Royal Aſſent, which as in probability, it will never be demanded, ſo it will never be granted to that, then that fear is out of Doors.</p>
            <p>Then he goes on with a company of lofty words, about the Oriency of the Pearl of Succeſſion, and tells you that <hi>the Kings of</hi> England <hi>themſelves, their Chancellors, Treaſurers, and all great</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Officers of State, their Privy Councellors and Judges, are all by the Proviſion of the Law, ſworn upon the Holy Evangeliſts, to defend and maintain the Rights of the Crown, and that they ſuffer no Diſheriſon or Dammage to accrue thereto,</hi> and very gravely cites <hi>Poulton</hi> for his Authority: this<note place="margin">1. Edw. 3. 18.</note> is very diſingeniouſly done, for that Preſident he ſo much raves on, is only the Form of the Oath for Juſtices, by which name Judges were then called, to <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ake upon admittance, which I ſuppoſe. they may do at this day, to their Offices, which was amongſt other things, <hi>That they ſhould not aſſent to any thing in Damage or Diſheriſon to our Lord the King, nor to know any ſuch Damage or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heriſon, but to reveal or cauſe it to be revealed unto him;</hi> not a word of the Rights of the Crown, which are, I ſuppoſe foiſted in, the better to impoſe upon the World, that the Judges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are bound by the Tenure of their Oath, to hinder any Law, to alter the Succeſſion; the words do not at all look forward, but are only as to what may concern the King Regnant, to whom they are ſworn.</p>
            <p>'Tis a great fayleur in our Law, that there is no puniſhment, for ſuch Impudent miſ-citers of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53416:4"/>
to ſerve a turn: for, without doubt they are within the Equity of the Pillory for their officious pains and induſtry.</p>
            <p>Next he comes to a great Remarque in Parliament, which he cites the Roll for; namely, that the Lords and Commons, being demanded their Advice by the King, in a matter relati<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g the Crown, did Anſwer with one Voice, <hi>That they could not Aſſent to anything in Parliament,</hi>

               <hi>that tended to the diſheriſon of the King, and his Heirs, or the Crown, whereto they were Sworn</hi> This looks like ſomewhat, but will not appear much, upon ſtrickt Inſpection: The Story is thus; The Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> declared in that Parliament, that the Offers of <hi>David Bruce</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> for Peace were, <hi>ſo as he might freely Enjoy to him the whole Realm of</hi> Scotland, <hi>without any ſubjection,</hi> &amp;c. The Lords and Commons, being willed to give their Advice, made ſeveral Anſwers, <hi>That they could not Aſſent to any ſuch Peace, but to the diſheriſon of the King, and of his Crown, and to the great danger of themſelves, being Sworn to the ſame.</hi> That Anſwer now, reſolves only into this, it ſets forth the ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of ſuch a Peace, not much conſidered it may be before, as the Diſheriſon of the King of the Fee of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which his Parliament could not, that is, were unwilling to Aſſent to an uſual Form of denyal amongſt great men, it does not at all declare their incapability through want of Power, for had that been the Caſe, the Kings Council would not have been ſo weak as to have put it to them. But Sir <hi>Edward Cokes</hi> Comment upon the Record makes all out, as he ſays, in <hi>Margine</hi> or the <hi>Margent</hi> of Inſt. 4. 14 <hi>no King can Alien the Crown, though by Conſent of Lords and Commons,</hi> then my Author is at his old Ward again, for my Lord <hi>Cookes</hi> Words are not ſo full, but only Declarative, what were the Words of the Parliament at that time, what his Opinion was of the Power of that High Court, I ſhall ſhew hereafter; Then he comes to a late Example of the recognition to King <hi>James,</hi> in which that Kings Title is acknowledged, <hi>and the Parliament doth Humbly beſeech the King to accept the Recognition not only to himſelf but to his Heir forever, nay, they go</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Jac. C. 1.</note> 
               <hi>further, they deſire that this Recognition may have the Royal Aſſent,</hi> &amp;c. I Wonder now this ſhould be urged, for nothing of Virtue can be conveyed by an Act of Parliament to that Title that's derived from God and Nature, becauſe one Parliament may undo the Acts of any of their Predeceſſors, nay <hi>Magna Charta</hi> it ſelf is not ſhotfree, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding<note place="margin">25 Ed. 1. C. 2.</note> the Statute, that ſays, all Judgments againſt <hi>Magna Charta</hi> ſhall be Void.</p>
            <p>Next he tells you, <hi>That the Right Heir of the Crown cannot be Barr'd or Excluded by Act of Parliament, Becauſe the deſcent of the Crown in an Inſtant abſolutely Purgeth and Diſchargeth all Obstructions and Incapacities whatſoever, Created by the ſame Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> but now, if an Act of Parliament hinder that deſcent, that Argument is Non-ſuit, notwithſtanding all his Examples according to his uſual way, to no purpoſe, no Caſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged being any thing Parallel to that he pretends to; One great Argument he hath is, That the Law of the Crown differs from Subjects in point of deſcents, as deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an Alien, no Coheirs in the Caſe, no Tenancy by Courteſy, Deſcent by half Bloud, as all Honours do, <hi>And therefore that may be Law in Caſe of the Crown,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 15.</note> 
               <hi>which is not in Caſe of the Subject.</hi> So not to be affected by Parliament as he would imply, or elſe he ſays nothing; by that Rule Copy-hold Tenure and Gavel kind are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted too, becauſe their Deſcents are not like the Common Law, a pretty Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
            <p>I muſt now take Notice how this unworthy Son of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as he, and I think truly terms himſelf, Treats Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> though it be out of my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to ſay any thing in juſtification of the uſage of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> yet I muſt vindicate that great Queen from his Black Calumny: after a kind Expreſſion or two about the <hi>Scots</hi> Queen, he tells you, That Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Inheriting her Fathers <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laverſion</hi> to the Houſe of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſent her to a loathſom Priſon, 'tis true, She was a Priſoner at large under the Care of the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> where nothing of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was denyed her but Acceſs to the Queen, until ſhe fell into the Correſpondence with <hi>Babington,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>He tells you farther, That the generality of Mankind lookt upon <hi>Maryes</hi> Title to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53416:5"/>
the Crown better than the other, <hi>Elizabeth</hi> being Baſtardized and rendred unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable by Act of Parliament, yet unrepealed, at leaſtwiſe but a Stature Queen, as he unmannerly Terms her, when he Treats Queen <hi>Mary</hi> her Siſter, who was in his Senſe but a Statute Queen at another rate, for in the Diſpute betwixt her and the Lady <hi>Jane Grey,</hi> he brings in an Hiſtorian, ſaying <hi>Tali &amp; conſtanti veneratione nos Angli legitimos Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges proſequimur ut ab eorum debito obſequio,</hi> &amp;c. By him thus Engliſhed: Such and ſo conſtant a Veneration have we <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> for our Lawful Princes, that we are not to be drawn from our due Obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here Queen <hi>Mary</hi> notwithſtanding her being Baſtardized by Parliament is allowed a lawful Queen, but Religion covered her Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, which laid the others more open; but our Proteſtant is now come to himſelf, for Cat will be Cat ſtill.</p>
            <p>I muſt ask this Proteſtant now who they were that Judged Queen <hi>Maryes</hi> Title bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> it was not the Parliament, for Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was Proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Queen by a Popiſh Parliament, ſitting at her Siſters Death, ſhe was ſo by <hi>Heath</hi> the Chancellor, Arch-Biſhop of <hi>York</hi> She was allowed to be ſo by the Pope, and ſo Stiled, till his Holineſs publiſhed his Bull againſt her, ſhe was ſo Stiled by all Chriſtian Princes, except you will ſay, <hi>Francis</hi> the Second of <hi>France</hi> his Quartering her Arms was an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the contrary, though he never had the Courage to juſtify it.</p>
            <p>Beſides all theſe, my Author may remember what he allowed to be Law once in Her Caſe, and in the Caſe of <hi>Hen.</hi> the Seventh, <hi>That the Crown takes away all Defects in Blood and incapacities by Parliament, and from that time that the King</hi> viz. Henry the Seventh <hi>did Aſſume the Crown, all Impediments were diſcharged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have now run over the moſt material Points of his Arguments about Succeſſion, to which I ſhall now oppoſe ſomething of my own: I ſhall lay down for my Poſition, <hi>That the Parliament may make what Laws they pleaſe, even againſt the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which nevertheleſs ſhall be Binding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before I enter any further I premiſe this, That my Deſign is only to ſet forth the Power of a King environed with his Three Eſtates, <hi>more terible than an Army with Banners;</hi> His Power is then like that King <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>In the Word of a King there is Power, who may ſay unto him, What dost thou:</hi> it is not at all to Direct or Adviſe to make uſe of it, hoping there may never be occaſion for it.</p>
            <p>In order now to the making good my aſſertion, its fit to Examine a little what the Law of Nature is, or what is meant by it, which he was never ſo kind to do; though he make ſuch a noyſe about the Words, yet he would never tell us what he meant by them, which by his good Favour, is a kind of (if not abſolute) <hi>Jargon</hi> or Canting; one of the Fathers defines it to be <hi>impreſſio divini luminis</hi> an impreſſion in us, and a participation of the Eternal Light in the rational Creature. Another ſays, <hi>It is an Act of Reaſon taken properly,</hi> Man now being a Creature adopted to Society is allowed by Natures Law (which<note place="margin">Aquinas.</note> according to which Definition you pleaſe) is nothing but rectified reaſon, to improve it, as far as he pleaſes, ſaving to every man the like Liberty, either by way of commerce or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, notwithſtanding now this natural liberty, nothing's more ordinary than to reſcind it, as in Caſe of Warrs betwixt Country, and Country, or upon other State accounts, <hi>yet no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining in our Streets,</hi> by the Law of Nature every man is free to follow what Profeſſion he pleaſes, yet you ſee how there are reſtriction layd dayly in the Caſe upon men, and ſuch and ſuch Trades confin'd to ſuch, and ſuch Societyes of Men, as the <hi>Eaſt-Indy, Guiny</hi> Companys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or elſe to perſons qualified, by the contemptible Statute Law (as the Learned Author would intimate) to follow them, yet not a word of theſe Violations, upon the ſacred Law of Nature; nay to come more Home, and familiarly to the Caſe, the great Law of Nature is violated in the Statute that declares who are, and what ſhall be the puniſhment of Rogues, yet the moſt ſtrict Caſuiſt, never wrote, nor much ſpoke againſt them. If now upon an Indictment <hi>E. F.</hi> ſhould be enterteyned upon the Traver<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>, who
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53416:5"/>
would make us believe he is a Lawyer, to run down thoſe Acts as Invalid, becauſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences upon the Law of Nature, (as he doth endeavour to run down one though not yet in Embryo, if it ſhould paſs into an Act, upon the ſame Account,) he would paſs for a Quaker, or one Candidate for the new Palace in <hi>Morefields,</hi> nay <hi>Polygamy</hi> is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Law of Nature, yet the reſtrictions upon it, I hope by <hi>E. F</hi>'s. leave, are pardonable.</p>
            <p>It will not be amiſs now in order to our end, to examine how thoſe Laws of Nature for Succeſſion, according to Proximity of Blood are regarded in other <hi>Christian</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, they are ſet aſide in all Elective Kingdoms, as the Empire, the Kingdom of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the Titulado Dukedom of <hi>Venice,</hi> nay the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> which is <hi>E. F.</hi> s belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved preſident, gives no regard to the Example of <hi>Zelophehads</hi> Daughters, though he lay ſuch ſtreſs upon it in another caſe; beſides how many times, without regard to the Male Line it ſelf, hath that Line bin altered? yet none diſputes that Kings Title, but to ſay the Truth, the Pope, who alone may diſpoſe of Succeſſion, had a hand in advancing the <hi>Carolingian</hi> Line, to the prejudice of the <hi>Merovinian,</hi> which like <hi>Offa Cerbero,</hi> a ſop to <hi>Cerberus,</hi> keeps the Cur from ſnarling,.</p>
            <p>How was that Law of Nature violated by the gui<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t of the Dauphinale to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> by the Union of the Kingdom of <hi>Navarr</hi> and Dutchy of <hi>Britain</hi> to the ſaid Crown? By Virtue of which Union, <hi>Britagne</hi> is enjoyed by the French King, when the Right of Proxinity of Blood lyes in the Houſe of <hi>Savoy</hi> to no purpoſe. If Natures Law be Violable, or hath bin violated in one place, without Taxation of Injuſtice, at the Diſcretion of the Supreme Power, which in every Conſtitution of Government is lodged ſomwhere, as by theſe Examples is made out, then it may admit of Violations again under the like Circumſtances, that is of Safety and Security, for thoſe were the true ends of thoſe Unions, For that rule of Living, <hi>Quod tibi fieri non vis alteri ne feceris,</hi> what thou wouldſt not have done to thy ſelf, do not to another, improved by the Law of Grace to, <hi>whatſoever you would that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Men ſhould do unto you, that do unto them:</hi> does not at all reach Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munityes or Societyes of Men, as may modeſtly be offered, otherways Maiefactours might make uſe of that <hi>Plea</hi> againſt the ſecurity of the Laws in their concerns; now a great Latitude muſt be allowed to the Legiſlative Power, in making Laws upon emergent occaſions to provide for the Publick ſafety, otherwayes our Sanguinary Laws againſt Robbery and Polygamy, being contrary to the Laws of God, which directs otherways in the former, and allowed, the latter muſt fall under a ſevere cenſure.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now haſten to Concluſion only ſubjoyn ſomwhat about <hi>Henry the Seventh, Whoſe Laws E. F.</hi> ſays my Lord <hi>Bacon Comments</hi> (becauſe he ſays ſomthing in his Caſe) very handſomly upon, That King paſt two Notable Statutes, as he ſays, one that <hi>the Crown ſhould reſt and abide to himſelf and his Heirs, &amp;c.</hi> The other that all perſons ſhould <hi>be indemnifyed that ſerved the King for the time being in his Warrs, This Law</hi> ſays my Lord <hi>Bacon, had in it parts of prudent and deep foreſight, for it took away oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for the People to buſy themſelves in prying into the Kings Title to the Crown: for howſoever that fell out, good or bad, the peoples ſafety was provided for.</hi> The ſame Author in the cloſe of that Kings Life, accounts it amongſt his Bleſſings that he dyed ſo ſoon, <hi>viz.</hi> before the Prince comes to mans Eſtate, who, in likelyhood conſidering his great Spirit, would not have ſitten down under the Law of ſettlement, but have ſeazed the preſent Poſſeſſion of the Crown, as his Right by common Law, the Curteſy not reaching the caſe of the Crown, as has bin ſayd before, This <hi>E. F.</hi> is mighty fond on, as coming from ſo great a Man, but to examine the matter over again, I cannot ſee not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding my Lord <hi>Bacons</hi> Authority, how the Peoples ſafety was provided for by the Law of indemnity, if the Kings was not by the Statute of ſettlement; For if once <hi>Henry the Seventh</hi> had fallen under the Power of his Son, as there has often hapned ſuch Caſes or any other Pretender, of the Houſe of <hi>York,</hi> the Statute of ſafety for the People, as well as that of ſettlement for the King had bin equally out of Doors, by alledging that <hi>Henry the Seventh</hi> was no Legall King, ſo no Legall Parliament, like thoſe of the three
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53416:6"/>
               <hi>Henryes,</hi> and therefore nothing of that King binding. I wonder therefore ſo great a Man as my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> ſhould branch at ſo empty a Rate, but more that ſo palpable a nothing ſhould paſs upon a man, that has ſuch Skill in that Knotty way of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation, as <hi>E. F.</hi> pretends to have.</p>
            <p>Now that ſomething has been ſaid to prove that Parliaments have done, and do dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encroach upon the Law of Nature, without the leaſt grumbling imaginable, I ſhall give ſome Scripture Preſidents when Proximity of Blood, the thing inſiſted upon, in the Caſe of Government hath not been much regarded, yet no abſolute proof of Gods imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Command in the Caſe, <hi>Cain</hi> was ſet aſide for <hi>Seth, Sem</hi> is not agreed to have bin the Elder Brother, whether <hi>Abraham</hi> was or no, is likewiſe a Queſtion, but to be ſure neither <hi>Iſaac</hi> nor <hi>Jacob</hi> were, <hi>Reuben, Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> were ſet aſide for their Vices, and the Dominion of all given to <hi>Judah;</hi> but theſe Examples may be Objected againſt, becauſe the times before the Flood were dark; and the other may be ſaid to be in relation to Spirituals; becauſe none of them had, as appears, many to exerciſe a Royal Authority over, but a Royal Power ſome did Exerciſe as is Evident by <hi>Abrahams</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to Sacrifice his Son, and <hi>Judah's</hi> commanding his Daughter in Law to be burnt, which none but an unaccountable perſon could do: From the time of <hi>Moſes</hi> unto <hi>David</hi> Proximity of Blood was not regarded, <hi>Joſhuah</hi> of another Tribe ſucceeded <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Monarchy, the Succeſſion going at the ſame race amongſt all the Judges, except in the Caſe of <hi>Abimelech,</hi> whoſe manners and Succeſs are not very Argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for the Traverſe: now That thoſe Judges were Kings, or ſo eſteemed, is plain from the Text, <hi>In thoſe days there was no King in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>but every man,</hi> &amp;c. becauſe at that time when that Villany was committed by the <hi>Benjamites,</hi> then was an <hi>Inter regnum,</hi> none to Judge the People as formerly.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Aſmonaean</hi> Family or <hi>Machabees</hi> began at the ſame Rate, for <hi>Mattathias</hi> who got a party to oppoſe the Wicked proceedings of that ungodly <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> when he dyed, bequeathed the Captainſhip of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which he had exerciſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them ſucceſsfully for a while, unto <hi>Judas</hi> his Third Son, as the moſt fit, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aſide <hi>Simon</hi> his Eldeſt, though a worthy perſon, which he made appear when he came after the Death of <hi>Jonathan</hi> his Younger Brother, to the Adminiſtration of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick affairs, no immediate hand of God in this, as may be ſaid in the other, for then there was no Prophet in <hi>Iſrael</hi> to direct them, the <hi>Theocracy</hi> being determined, as may appear from <hi>Mach. 1.

            <p>For a parting blow, now in Anſwer to what is or can be ſaid in the Caſe, I ſhall lay down this Theſis, <hi>That Statute Laws though contrarient to the Laws of God are binding,</hi> this I ſhall make out by pertinent Examples, an unanſwerable Argument of the Power, though perhaps not of the Juſtice of Parliaments; concerning their Power I will give you my Lord <hi>Cookes</hi> Senſe, whoſe Authority my Author ſeems to value elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>

            <p>I ſhall give you another Inſtance, that Acts of Parliaments againſt the Law of God <hi>quoad forum humanum,</hi> though not in <hi>foro Conſcientiae,</hi> to man-ward, though not to God-ward are binding, which is to be ſo underſtood by my poſition at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this <hi>Paragraph,</hi> for though we muſt chuſe rather <hi>to Obey God than Man,</hi> yet to Oppoſe by force an Act ſo made, <hi>viz.</hi> contrary to Gods Law, is Treaſon by mans Law, as it may be Circumſtanced, my Preſidents are ſuch as both Papiſts and Proteſtant <hi>E. F.</hi> and <hi>G. H.</hi> will agree to be ſuch: The Bloody Statute of the VI Articles which made Popery a Statute Religion, as well, as ſome ſay, that Proteſtaniſm is made ſo ſince, was againſt all the Rules and Methods of Chriſtianity, and conſequently againſt the Laws of Gods, as all Proteſtants hold, yet it muſt be allowed to be binding, as long as it laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: The Papiſts, <hi>viz. E. F.</hi> and his Fellow Clubbers at the Compendium of the Plot, that bundle of Lyes and Ill manners, without doubt think, and upon Occaſion, will ſay, that our Sanguinary Laws againſt Prieſts are againſt the Laws of God, yet even they will not deny but they are binding <hi>Quoad Forum Humanum</hi> to manward.</p>
            <p>Now as Concluſive, and in Anſwer concerning what he ſays, That his Sacred Majeſty that now is, will not ſuffer in his time, a Pearl of this Magnitude and Oriency, to be Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed by any hands out of the Imperial Diadem of this Realm, I ſhall offer this, That a Declarative Act of that Power in the Parliament is the greateſt Security to any Prince Regnant, in the Caſe of a contingent remainder, as I will put a Caſe, which may, but I hope will never be our own, admit the now Queen of <hi>Spain,</hi> happen to be the next re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder or Preſumptive Heir, which God forbid; and being Acted by her Husbands and other Popiſh Councils ſhould without natural Affection, which is always with them poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond to Religion, attempt to remove the Obſtruction by Vile Agents, <hi>Quis tot referre fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <hi>Spain</hi> in the late Marriage with <hi>France,</hi> provided againſt all Contingencies of that Nature, by making the Daughter of <hi>Spain</hi> renounce all pretenſions to the Crown, in Caſe it ſhould happen to be her Right, and though it may be Objected, it was not Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, becauſe of her Aſſent, yet whoſo Conſiders Her Young Years, will not Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue much from thence.</p>
            <p>If there was no Remedy in ſuch a Caſe, eſpecially when there is a natural impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of defeating the Preſumptive Heir, by natural means, as in the Caſe of the late great Queen, what encouragement can any man have to do his Duty, in Defending the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Poſſeſſour from the practiſes of the Impatient Heir, when he is ſure to be at laſt layd open to all Injuries imaginable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Holy League to prevent that, Petitioned the Conſiſtory at <hi>Rome,</hi> That they might have leave to <hi>overthrow the Succeſſion in a full Aſſembly of the States, and to make the naming of a Succeſſor Subject unto the ſaid States,</hi> yet none of that Party concerned themſelves much, with the unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that Petition, being ſatisfied I ſuppoſe, with the expediency of the thing.</p>
