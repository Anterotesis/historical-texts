         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and can deſcribe him by many remarkable ſignes and tokens which
you have not mentioned in your Hue and Cry. I know what habit
he weares, and where he bought it, the outſide of his doubles is
black Sattin, and I'me ſure it is not long ſince one of his skirts

made for the loſſe of him at many Tavernes in the City, eſpecially
at the Mere-maid in Cheapeſide, for they have loſt a ſweet cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

the loſſe of him, yet the Drawers rejoyce; for now they take their
reſt, and ſleepe their fill, that were wont to fit up and wait on him

there is a freſh ayre, and a fayre ſtrong houſe, where

triangular ſtop in thy way, which will hinder thy procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.

that Roade will not afford it; and I can prove by ſeverall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
that many a paſſenger that hath travelled that way,
have for want of drinke and ſomewhat elſe beene choaked.
Hearken therefore to my admonition for good counſell cannot

               <p>Why I can tell thee where he is, but I am loath to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
thy griefe, yet I will tel thee for thy caſe and mine (in
that point) are much alike: well I can hold no longer, but with
a grieved heart and watery eyes I tell thee, that hee and my
friend <hi>Royſton</hi> are bed-fellowes in the Fleet; come let us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
one another, let us not grieve too much for them: why
ſhould we ſhew more love to them then to our ſelves? Hang
them, let them goe: and I doe earneſtly perſwade thee to hang
thy ſelfe alſo, for feare thou come to a worſe end. VVhat ſaiſt
thou <hi>Britanicus?</hi> doſt thou think thou ſhalt die a better death?</p>

            <p>What now <hi>Britanicus,</hi> doſt thou in thy Vindication
vomit out thy poyſoned Crocodile teares in ſlanders,
to brand thoſe that are not of thy diſpoſition, in term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to be Malignants? thou half-headed peſant,
I would have thee know they have to their powers, and
doe what lyes in them for the generall good of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
and Kingdome, and will to the hazard of their
lives and fortunes, and yet not endure thy baſe abuſing
his Maieſty. I wonder that the Parliament does not 
take ſome courſe againſt thy folly. Firſt thou calleſt
them Malignants, I grant Rebell, and who does puniſh
thee but the Parliament then in glorying in the name
of Royalliſt, wherein thou ſlandereſt many thouſands
who are good friends to the State and Kingdome? then
thou ſayeſt thou doeſt not intend to iuſtifie thy ſelfe.
No thou needeſt not, but ſue rather to the Parliament
with a two peny halter about thy necke, and that is the
beſt counſell I can give thee. And for thy paines thou
takes in ſetting out thy Pamphlet, what was thy aime
<hi>Britanious?</hi> I tell thee onely thy profit: And for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the State ſervice, as thou cals it, I beleeue it hath
beene to ſet the Kingdome together by the eares. And
for thy addreſſe to the Parliament, implore them for
ſome time of repentance and cry not, for they know
thou art a ſlandring Knave, and ſo adieu <hi>Britanicus.</hi>
