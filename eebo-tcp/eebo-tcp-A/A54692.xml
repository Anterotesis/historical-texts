            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>As it hath demonstrably already hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the taking and inrolling of <hi>Statutes Merchant,</hi> by the <hi>Majors</hi> of the <hi>Staple</hi> in all Cities, Burroughs, and good Towns, and their Officers thereunto appointed, by vertue of the <hi>Statutes</hi> or <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>Acton Burnel</hi> in 11 <hi>E.</hi> 1. and the Statute <hi>de Mercatoribus</hi> in 13 <hi>E.</hi> 1. which have since the erecting of the Statute Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice at <hi>London,</hi> by the Statute of 23 H. 8. 6. to attend the Lord Cheif Justices of the Court of <hi>Upper Bench,</hi> or <hi>Common Pleas;</hi> and in their absence, the <hi>Major</hi> of the <hi>Staple</hi> at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and <hi>Recorder</hi> of <hi>London:</hi> For acknowledging of Statutes for Debts have been so much disused, and the course of <hi>Statutes Merchant</hi> which are yet in force for Merchandise so neglected, as there are above a hundred such Statutes entred, to or for every one <hi>Statute Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant:</hi> And whereas the <hi>Clerk</hi> of the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,</hi> who was by that <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> ordered to reside at <hi>London,</hi> doth fairly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61938:7"/>
and orderly enter and keep his <hi>Books</hi> and <hi>Records,</hi> and after certain years, lodg and lay them up for safety in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> It will upon search and inquiry appear, that notwithstanding every <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,</hi> whether for Merchandise or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, is to be duly Inrolled by the <hi>Clerks</hi> or <hi>Officers,</hi> upon pain of forfeiting of Twenty pounds for every <hi>Statute</hi> not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred or Inrolled, there can be found very few of the <hi>Rolls</hi> or <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>Statutes Merchant</hi> since 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and none at all of those that were taken and Inrolled in Two hundred years before.</p>
            <p>The difference betwixt the now <hi>Statute Office,</hi> which is inperpetual succession to such a capital City, and superior <hi>Courts,</hi> as the City of <hi>London,</hi> and the Courts of <hi>Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Bench</hi> and <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> and annexed as it were unto them, and the <hi>Town<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Clerks</hi> or <hi>Majors,</hi> or <hi>Constables</hi> of the <hi>Staple</hi> in the other Cities and Corporations, which do so often change, and are by election, as they become little more then as private persons, giving us the reason why those <hi>Writings</hi> or <hi>Records</hi> in their custody, coming after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61938:7"/>
through so many changes, to so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny several hands as they do, can no way, as it seems, escape imbezelling. We may well enough believe, that the same <hi>fate</hi> may attend these Country <hi>Registers,</hi> if they shall not be made to be as a <hi>Court of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,</hi> and in perpetual Succession; and if they shall be made to be as so many <hi>Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catures</hi> and <hi>Courts of Record,</hi> will be the cause of more inconveniences to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, then the loss and imbezeling of their <hi>Records</hi> or <hi>Inrollments,</hi> can come unto.</p>
            <p>The City of <hi>London</hi> which did<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> use to Inroll such <hi>Deeds</hi> in the <hi>Hustings,</hi> and divers other Cities, Boroughs, and Towns Corporate, who did use to do the like, and had therefore their Rights ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly saved by the <hi>Proviso</hi> of that <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Anno</hi> 27 <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight for <hi>Inrollments,</hi> and that it should not extend to any <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, Lands, Tenements,</hi> or <hi>Hereditaments,</hi> within the said Cities, Boroughs, or Towns Corporate; for that they did an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, and before the making of that <hi>Act,</hi> use to Inroll such <hi>Deeds,</hi> will by these new <hi>Registries,</hi> without any forfeiture, or

            <p>And that by such, or some other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asters, we might have had as bad an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of them, as are now to be had of all the <hi>Records</hi> and <hi>Court Rolls</hi> of the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> Turns, <hi>County</hi> and <hi>Hundred</hi> Courts, <hi>Courts</hi> Leet, or <hi>Courts</hi> Baron, and <hi>Justices</hi> in Eyre, since the time of <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, and K. <hi>Henry</hi> the Second: When as none of the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> Turns, <hi>County</hi> and <hi>Hundred</hi> Courts, can shew us any <hi>Records</hi> of above Twenty years stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if so much, the proceedings therein,

            <p>And that those <hi>Records</hi> of the petty and inferior Courts of Antient times, which are now to be found in the <hi>Treasuries,</hi> and amongst the Records at <hi>London</hi> and <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> do not amount to any more then to about the Ten thousandth part of those Country and inferior Courts Records, which are lost and not to be found; and that those that are to be seen, are but as some pitiful scraps and torn pieces of what have been rescued and taken out of the Jaws of Time and Antiquity.</p>
