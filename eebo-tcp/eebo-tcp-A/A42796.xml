         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ELEGY
On the Famous
THOMAS THIN <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
Who was Barbarouſly Murthered.</head>
            <l>WHat Arrogance doſt Thou, Malicious Fate,</l>
            <l>On Us in this Brave 'Squire impetrate?</l>
            <l>Or does the Upper Orb his Patience hold,</l>
            <l>To ſuffer Droſs to intermingle Gold</l>
            <l>No longer? Snatching up the Soul of <hi>THIN</hi>'s,</l>
            <l>From our Light Droſs, and from all Weighty Sins,</l>
            <l>Sublimity extols Him with her Wing,</l>
            <l>Contemning Knighthood here, there to be King:</l>
            <l>Then what can we condole us of a Fate,</l>
            <l>That gives Him Joy in her extream of hate?</l>
            <l>His Six-days Labour, in the laſt of Seven,</l>
            <l>GOD's Providence call'd Him to reſt in Heaven.</l>
            <l>Can all the Muſes of the three times three,</l>
            <l>Give a due Merit in His Elegie?</l>
            <l>Fame ſorely weeps, to loſe a Favourite;</l>
            <l>And Honour mourns, to be eclips'd in Night:</l>
            <l>Obſcure muſt all things be, and Light has done</l>
            <l>On Earth, when Earth cannot obtain its Sun.</l>
            <l>Me thinks I ſee as have my thoughts eſpi'd,</l>
            <l>The Grains of Muſtard ſeed (ſown in His Side)</l>
            <l>Growing beyond th'extent of Envies Pride.</l>
            <l>Me thoughts I heard the Piſtols in their ſtunning,</l>
            <l>Give a report in Heav'n, <hi>Brave</hi> THIN'<hi>s a coming.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Me thoughts I ſaw the Heav'ns make Preparation</l>
            <l>To Welcom Him with Joy, poſt Caſtigation:</l>
            <l>Me thoughts I ſaw Him Crown'd, and plac'd on high,</l>
            <l>This World His Foot-ſtool, bidding Fate Good-by.</l>
            <l>But why do I conſiſt in thoughts, (remaining</l>
            <l>In ſuch dim ſights?) He's really obtaining</l>
            <l>All Meritorious Glory can be found</l>
            <l>Above this World in the Coeleſtial Round.</l>
            <l>Death bitter in His Mouth, b'ing ſwallow'd up,</l>
            <l>His Belly found the ſweetneſs of the Cup:</l>
            <l>Death coming in ſuch Gall, and bitter'd Ore,</l>
            <l>He ſwallow'd it, to taſte it never more.</l>
            <l>Who has the Loſs? Not Him by this Confuſer?</l>
            <l>'Tis we in Him, and all the World's a Loſer.</l>
            <l>Brave <hi>THIN</hi> h's loſt nothing ſave a heap of Nought;</l>
            <l>We have loſt all, in loſing Him we ſought.</l>
            <l>What can <hi>THIN</hi> loſe in this Terreſtrial Life?</l>
            <l>He loſes Sorrow, we Joy, and he all Strife.</l>
            <l>Did we not ſee at that Outragious Blow,</l>
            <l>The Powdry-Smoke into thick Vapours grow,</l>
            <l>Mixt with the Clouds, their obſcure Shadows hurl'd</l>
            <l>Their Mourning-Mantle, muffled up the World;</l>
            <l>Ev'ry Ear fill'd with Clamours, and the Sky</l>
            <l>Seem'd to lament this Bloody Tragedy?</l>
            <l>The middle Element was fill'd with Groans,</l>
            <l>And Mother-Earth quak'd at her Peoples Moans:</l>
            <l>All Women wept, all Mankind grieved ſore,</l>
            <l>Salt Tears ran trickling like the Common-Shore,</l>
            <l>And Children with their Infant-Voices rore.</l>
            <l>The Heavens rejoyced at this Murders Birth;</l>
            <l>Joy was in Heaven, Sorrow here on Earth:</l>
            <l>The dull thick Clouds (as Mourning Scenes of <hi>Troy</hi>)</l>
            <l>Did part this ſorrowful World, and Heavens new Joy;</l>
            <l>Joy in the Heavens receiving ſuch a Soul,</l>
            <l>Loſing his Perſon here we all condole.</l>
            <l>Heaven that has Preſcience over all,</l>
            <l>And knowing how <hi>THIN</hi>'s accident would fall,</l>
            <l>Call'd Him in haſte to take His Heavenly Lot;</l>
            <l>We find <hi>THIN</hi>'s anſwer thus,<note n="*" place="bottom">The Anagram on his Name.</note> 
               <hi>Th'n I am Shot.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But in this Life what was this famous 'Squire,</l>
            <l>Servant to GOD in low things, now of higher:</l>
            <l>He had a courteous Manſuet Behaviour,</l>
            <l>And never out of Fickle Fortunes Favour;</l>
            <l>Lovely in Looks, Gracious in all his Ways,</l>
            <l>Whilſt he was living we had happy Days:</l>
            <l>Riches dwelt with him, and in ſuch a ſtore,</l>
            <l>That Liberality ſmil'd on the Poor:</l>
            <l>So Wiſe, ſo Literate, ſo Valiant He,</l>
            <l>That now the World has nothing of thoſe three:</l>
            <l>Belov'd of KING and Court for Worthy Fame,</l>
            <l>And all the Vulgars did adore his Name:</l>
            <l>He was a Faithful Subject to the KING,</l>
            <l>Till Death came in this Woful Suffering.</l>
            <l>So are we loſt of all; <hi>MONMO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TH</hi> and <hi>GRAY,</hi>
            </l>
