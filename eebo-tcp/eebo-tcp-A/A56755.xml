            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Received your Letter, wherein you give me an Account of a ſtrange ſort of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper in the Eyes of the Inhabitants about <hi>London:</hi> And I find you deſire that I would communicate what uſefull Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I have made in that Diſtemper.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:44428:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I muſt tell you, that our Countrey Folk are infeſted with the ſame Diſtemper, and I attribute it unto ſome unuſual Qualities in the Air and Winds at this time; and I find that the uſe of an <hi>American</hi> Specifick doth great Service with us: I learned it of an <hi>Indian</hi> Doctor; it is a ſort of a Scarlet Seed with a ſmall black Speck in it: They are not eaſie to be met with, I once had ſome from a Druggiſt in <hi>Walbrook,</hi> but have forgot his Name. They ſingularly dry up Rhumes in the Head, ſtrengthen the Optick Nerves, cool Inflamations in the Eyes, and comfort the Animal Spirits; they cleanſe and heal: By their Balſamick vertue diſperſe the cloudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Brain, and clear the Sight. I am credibly informed that Dr. <hi>Stepkins</hi> that Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Oculiſt, performed many Admirable Cures with them, amongſt Men, Women and Children.</p>
            <p>One of your Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> who hath conſulted with Dr. <hi>Turbervil</hi> of <hi>Salisbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> came into our Countrey, having a grievous
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44428:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Opthalmy, deſired my Aſſiſtance, finding no Relief by his Advice. I directed him to the uſe of theſe <hi>American</hi> Seeds: I gave him the Tincture, Spirit and Extract in Waters, and alſo in Milk, and in all the liquid Aliments he took, and I caus'd him to wear a Neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of the ſame. It dryed up all his Rhumes in Forty days time.</p>
            <p>An old Gentlewoman whoſe Eyes were almoſt put out by the Evil, and had not only an Inflammation, but a Cataract was much feared, becauſe ſome of her Relations had been blind by that Diſtemper. I apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame Remedies to her, and it ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to Admiration.</p>
            <p>A young Woman whoſe Eyes were won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully inflamed after the Small Pox, and ſo weak ſhe could not endure to look againſt the Light, and in great Pain; ſhe had been blooded, and Purged, and Bannio'd and Bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd, and Cupt, had made two Iſſues, and a Seton in her Neck; and the Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> had applyed many Eye-waters, and Powders and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44428:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Oyntments for ſeven Months<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all to no purpoſe; and at length the uſe of this Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick perfectly recover'd her Eyes, to the great Joy of her Relations and her ſelf.</p>
            <p>A Child about four years old, whoſe Eyes were extream bad, and lay under the hands of a Woman who pretended great skill, ſhe pickt Five pounds out of the Parents pocket, upon a Promiſe of Cure, but never perform'd it. But at length one who had received Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by this Specifick, recommended it, and received thanks for ſo doing from the Childs Friends, and it hath been well ever ſince.</p>
            <p>A Miniſter whoſe Eyes by Reading and late Studying had a violent Defluxion of Rhume upon them, that they always look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Blood-ſhotten; after the uſe of other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods for two Months together, to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and then hearing of this Medicine, applyed himſelf to it, and only waſht his Eyes with pure Spring-water, and this Specifick perfectly recover'd him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:44428:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
A young Child born blind, was helpt by the Nurſes taking theſe Drops, the Child only ſucking her Milk, but its Diſtemper was an Opthalmy, but not a true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taract.</p>
            <p>There was a whole Family very much Diſtemper'd with Hot Rhumes in their Eyes; three of the Perſons were in danger of Cataracts growing in them: They had uſed all ſorts of Applications, and had ſuffer'd three pretending Women to tamper with them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Months, and at laſt hearing of theſe Scarlet Seeds, wore Necklaces of them, and took the Tincture made of them in all their Drink, and in a Months time were perfectly Cured, only taking twenty Drops at a time.</p>
