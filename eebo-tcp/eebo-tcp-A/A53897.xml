            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have been lately honoured by your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with a double command, one to preach,
the other to publish, this Sermon: of the
first of which though I might have been
innocently ambitious, yet of the second I may be just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
asham'd: partly, because the Sermon it self is
much unworthy of publique view, especially upon an
occasion of so great remark; partly, and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerningly,
in regard that having been so many years
happy in the knowledge of your Lordship, and as long
obliged as known unto your Honour, I have not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
appear'd with any thing worthy of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
Patronage. I shall therefore humbly crave the
leave of making to my self this interpretation, that
your Honour did intend this Command as a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of my duty, that I may hereafter meditate
something to demonstrate to whom I owe the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
of my studies. In the interim by this
present Discourse I shall only give a testimony, how
<pb facs="tcp:94537:3"/>
properly I have endeavoured the memory of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by obscuring his virtues, and your concernments,
in my expressions, from all persons who are strangers
to your Family, while I speak to them which were
known unto you both, as to such as cannot but be
most sensible, and bear a perpetual remembrance,
of them. Howsoever what is wanting in this Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Sermon, shall be supplyed in my perpetual devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
praying for an everlasting succession of <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

               <bibl>GEN. L. 10.</bibl>
               <q>And he made a mourning for his Father seven
daies.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THere are two great names concealed
in this Text, but express'd by the
Prophet <hi>David</hi> in a peculiar and
eminent manner:<note place="margin">Psal. 77. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Thou hast with
thine arm redeemed thy people, the Sons of Iacob
and Ioseph.</hi> Great was the name of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
but all his Sons were not accepted; only <hi>Isaac</hi>
was in the Covenant. Great was the name
of <hi>Isaac,</hi> but his Son <hi>Esau</hi> was rejected. Great
then must the name of <hi>Iacob</hi> be, who had
twelve Sons, and all accepted. The whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God descended from him, and were
called <hi>Israelites,</hi> and the Sons of <hi>Iacob,</hi> as his by
generation from his loins. One of these twelve
was <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and the rest did equally descend from
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94537:4"/>
him, and might be called his Sons by preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
from his care and power. Howsoever,
he is exempted from the number of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;
and, that he might be styl'd a Father,
two Sons of his are numbred with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Sons, and ranked with the Patriarchs.
Thus were all the people of God <hi>the Sons of
Iacob and Ioseph;</hi> and <hi>Ioseph,</hi> while the Son of
<hi>Iacob,</hi> the Father of the Sons of <hi>Iacob.</hi> These
are the two concealed in the Text; <hi>Iacob</hi> the
Father, and that Father dead; <hi>Ioseph</hi> the Son,
and that a mourning Son: for <hi>he made a mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
for his Father seven daies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These words contain a brief relation of a
<hi>Patriarchal Funeral;</hi> in which two general
parts are presented to our view; The Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation
of the Obsequies; and, The Continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Solemnities. In the description of
the Solemnization there are four particulars
observable, The Connexion. The Person.
The Action. The Occasion. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion,
in the conjunctive particle <hi>And:</hi>
the Person understood, in the following pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noun
<hi>He:</hi> the Action represented, what <hi>He,</hi>
that is, <hi>Ioseph</hi> did, <hi>he made a mourning:</hi> the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
expressed, for whom he mourned, <hi>for
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94537:4"/>
his Father.</hi> The Connexion of the Text is
double, in reference to the Person, and in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Action. The Connexion of the
Person, <hi>And he;</hi> the Connexion of the Action
with the precedent actions of that person, <hi>And
he made a mourning.</hi> I shall begin with the
Connexion of the Person, and in my whole
discourse exactly prosecute the method of the
Text.</p>
            <p>When aged <hi>Iacob yeelded up the ghost,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 49. 33. 50. 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>and
was gathered unto his people, the Physitians embal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi>
Israel, <hi>and the</hi> Egyptians <hi>mourned for him
threescore and ten dayes.</hi> They were not as yet
the apparent enemies of God; they had their
tears for <hi>Iacob,</hi> who afterward would have
drowned all his Sons; they preserved and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
the daies of his life; and when those
were cut off, they continued the daies of his
weeping. But there is a difference between a
formal and a real sorrow, between a solemn
and a serious grief, between a popular and a
filial sadness. Wherefore <hi>Ioseph</hi> is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with the <hi>Egyptian</hi> mourning; he hath
a nearer relation then those strangers had, and
therefore more of affection is expected from
him; his filial sympathy must go beyond
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94537:5"/>
their accustomed civility; the <hi>Egyptians</hi> mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<hi>and He made a mourning for his Father.</hi> This
is the Connexion in respect of the Person; that
of the Action followeth.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Iacob</hi> was near the time of his disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
<hi>Ioseph</hi> put his hand under his thigh,
and sware unto him that he would deal kindly
and truly with him, that he would bury him
in the burying place of his Fathers. When he
gathered up his feet into the bed and died,<note place="margin">Gen. 50. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph
fell on his Fathers face, and wept upon him,
and kissed him,</hi> and so paid the first-fruits of a
Funeral with his eyes and with his lips. After
this he commanded the Physicians to follow
with Spices and embalm him, desirous to
preserve that body to the utmost possibility
from corruption, from which he had received
his generation. Then he entreated and obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
leave of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to perform his Oath
which he sware unto <hi>Iacob:</hi> he went up to the
Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to take possession with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
body, and laid him in the field which
<hi>Abraham</hi> bought.<note place="margin">Gen. 49. 31.</note> 
               <hi>There they buried</hi> Abraham
<hi>and</hi> Sarah <hi>his wife, there they buried</hi> Isaac <hi>and</hi>
Rebekah <hi>his wife, there</hi> Jacob <hi>buried</hi> Leah,
and there <hi>Ioseph</hi> buried <hi>Iacob.</hi> And having
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94537:5"/>
thus fulfilled all the duties belonging to a Son,
there remaining but this one, fitter to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
then required, <hi>he made a mourning for
his Father.</hi> This is the Connexion of the
Action.</p>
            <p>The Person or chief mourner then is <hi>Ioseph;</hi>
he which once was dead in the thoughts of
<hi>Iacob,</hi> and desires of his brethren, survives his
Father to attend his Funeral, and to preserve his
Brethren alive. His coming into <hi>Egypt</hi> cost
aged <hi>Iacob</hi> many a tear; and he must passe into
<hi>Canaan</hi> to demonstrate his gratitude, and pay
that debt unto his Father there. This eminent
Person is proposed for an example unto all
ages of the world: what he here performed,
was no legall Ceremony; he was a Patriarch,
and long before the law: he was a singular
and signal type of Christ, and hath done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which may misbecome the most retired
and sublimed Christian.</p>
            <p>And this will readily appear, if we joyn the
Action to the Person. <hi>He made a mourning.</hi> I
call't an Action, which may as well be term'd
a Passion: as <hi>a mourning,</hi> so a Passion; as <hi>he
made</hi> it, so an Action; a passionate action, or
an active passion. The internal grief of his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94537:6"/>
minde and sorrow of his heart, as an inward
passion of his soul, was voluntarily rais'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
him by resolved and continued thoughts of
his Fathers death; and at the same time the
expression of that grief was willingly powred
forth, as what he understood did well become
him. We are not only to bewail our sins,
but all those miseries which proceed from
them: and therefore tears were not only lent
us to declare Compunction, but also to express
Commiseration. We reade our blessed Saviour
twice did weep, once for the sins of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
once for the death of <hi>Lazarus</hi> whom he loved.
Two eyes Nature bestow'd upon us, though
perfectly and distinctly we can see but with
one at once, and both are equally made the
fountains of tears, as we are sinners for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition,
as we are Brethren for Compassion.
When the first Martyrs bloud was shed for the
Christian faith,<note place="margin">Act. 8. 2.</note> 
               <hi>devout men carryed</hi> Steven <hi>to his
burial, and made great lamentation over him;</hi> such
were the tears of the Infant Church. When
<hi>Peter</hi> found <hi>Dorcas,</hi> a woman full of good
works and Almesdeeds, dead, <hi>all the Widows
stood by him weeping.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 9. 39.</note> Thus the first which
died in Christianity, were followed with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94537:6"/>
solemn tears: and it was a wise observation
made by the Apostate <hi>Iulian,</hi> That one of the
the means to convert so many Heathens to our
Religion, was the care of the bodies, and the
solemnities alwayes used at the Funerals of
the dead. Thus far of the Action, <hi>He made a
mourning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The occasion of this sadness is expressed in a
word, but must be considered in many more,
as being the principal concernment both of the
Text and Time. The mover of his passion, the
object of his grief, the cause of his tears was his
Father, <hi>And he made a mourning for his Father.</hi>
This was so truly the occasion, that it was the
only cause, that there can be no reason imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
assigned why <hi>Ioseph</hi> should mourn, but
only because he had lost a Father. Though he
was aged to extremity, though he was holy
unto eminency, though he was happy to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
though no way disadvantagious by his
death to any, yet because dead, and that a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dead, <hi>he made a mourning for him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We usually say of ancient persons, that they
have already one foot in the grave, and the rest
of their life is nothing else but the bringing of
these feet together. Why then should we weep
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94537:7"/>
for the death of aged persons, when it can be but
the second part of their Funeral? That sorrow
seems to be but useless which is spent upon ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities,
and that grief irrational which would
create impossibilities.<note place="margin">Psa. 90. 10.</note> 
               <hi>The daies of our years are
threescore years and ten, and if by reason of strength
they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour
and sorrow.</hi> What reason then can we produce,
that the life of a man whom we esteem, should
be sorrow to himself, and his death be grief to
us? Now <hi>Iacob</hi> gave this account of his age to
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> when he came down to <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 47. 9. 28.</note> 
               <hi>The daies
of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and
thirty years;</hi> and he <hi>lived in the land seventeen years;
so the whole age of</hi> Jacob <hi>was an hundred forty and
seven years.</hi> This extremity of age had fastned
him to his bed, the perfect embleme and short
forerunner of his grave.<note place="margin">Gen. 48. 10.</note> 
               <hi>The eyes of</hi> Israel <hi>were
dim, so that he could not see;</hi> he was already in the
shades of darkness. Nay, <hi>the time drew nigh,</hi>
saith <hi>Moses, that</hi> Israel <hi>must die;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 47. 29.</note> there was a
natural necessity of his death, an apparent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility
of longer life; and yet this conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is no excuse to <hi>Ioseph,</hi> but <hi>he made a
mourning for his aged Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the death of the righteous is to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94537:7"/>
be desired rather then lamented: and it were a
dishonour put upon Religion to think a pious
man less happy dead, then when he liv'd.<note place="margin">Luk. 23. 28</note> 
               <hi>Weep
not for me,</hi> was the language of the immaculate
Lamb when he went to a shameful and a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
death: and why should he, which yeelds
up his soul with comfort, leave his body to be
covered with so much sorrow? Those which
live in impiety, and depart in their iniquity,
they which have here provoked the wrath of
God, and goe hence with that wrath abiding on
them, as they could create nothing to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
but sorrow in their life, so must they
necessarily increase it at their death. But <hi>Iacob</hi>
was a Patriarch, of eminent and constant piety,
particularly and remarkably belov'd of God,
highly blessed by him, and powerfully blessing
in his name; and yet when <hi>Iacob</hi> dieth, <hi>Ioseph</hi>
weepeth: <hi>And he made a mourning for his pious
Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Death is nothing else but a change
of a short and temporary for an unalterable and
eternal condition. From whence it followeth,
that those which dye in their sins, from thence
begin to feel those torments which shall never
cease: and therefore they leave behinde them a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94537:8"/>
sad occasion of grief and sorrow to such as are
apprehensive of the pains they feel. If the
Rich man in the Gospel were so careful of his
surviving brethren, and so concerned in their
welfare; if they had as well understood his sad
and irreversible condition, what floods of tears
would they have shed for him who call'd so
earnestly for a drop of water to cool his tongue!
But as for such as pass from hence into a
place of rest and joy, who change the miseries
of this sinful world for the blessed presence of a
good and gracious God; weeping at their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
may seem improper and unkinde offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciousness,
as 'twere a sorrow for their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and envy at their felicity. Now the soul
of <hi>Iacob</hi> was certainly at rest, and <hi>Ioseph</hi> suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
assured of his happiness. He knew that
his Father was heir of the same promise with
<hi>Abraham: for he looked for a City which hath
foundations, whose builder and maker is God;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 10, 13, 16.</note> he
<hi>died in faith,</hi> and <hi>imbraced the promises;</hi> he <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
that he was a stranger on the earth, and that
he sought a better countrey, that is, an heavenly;</hi>
and <hi>therefore God had prepared for him a City,</hi>
and he was in the bosome of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the
place of felicity. But the happiness of his soul
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94537:8"/>
is no excuse to <hi>Ioseph</hi> for the Funeral tears due
at the interment of his body. <hi>And he made a
mourning for his happy Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, many persons expiring give too
sad occasions of sorrow to their relations left
behinde: they which depend upon them,
whose subsistence liveth and dyeth, and whose
hopes are buried, with them, may goe to their
graves with unfeigned tears, lamenting not
so much the departure of their friend, as their
own loss; something they may weep for them,
and more for themselves. But the death of
<hi>Iacob</hi> was not of any such condition; there
could no disadvantage arise from that to <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi>
no interest of his could suffer by it. He
had already blessed all his Sons, and <hi>Ioseph</hi>
principally; there could be no more of heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
favours expected from his prayers or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies.
Had he died before he laid his hands
upon <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Menasseh,</hi> had <hi>Ioseph</hi> and
his Sons been absent when he blessed the rest,
he might have sadly mourned for the loss of his
Father, and of the Benediction. If <hi>Esau</hi> lift
up his voyce and wept, because he was defeated
of the blessing while <hi>Isaac</hi> lived, <hi>Ioseph</hi> might
well have made a mourning, had he been
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94537:9"/>
prevented of the Benediction by an unexpected
or a distant death. But <hi>Iacob</hi> blessed them,
and with his blessing gave order for his burial,
and with that blessing and that order died. And
as his death was no way prejudicial to the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,
so was it not at all disadvantageous to
the temporal condition of his Son. He suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
loss of no enjoyments by his Fathers death;
<hi>Iacob</hi> had lived long by the favour and the care
of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> his filial gratitude alone preserv'd his
life; but no such narrow thoughts abated the
freeness of <hi>Ioseph's</hi> sorrow. <hi>And he made a mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for his Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If none of these considerations, which work
so powerfully on other persons, did move this
Mourner to express such sorrow, what were the
Motives then which caus'd so deep a sense, what
meditations wrought so powerfully on the
heart of <hi>Ioseph?</hi> I answer, they were but two.
Mortality, and Paternity; the one supposed,
the other expressed in the text: <hi>Iacob</hi> was the
Father of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and that Father dead, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Ioseph</hi> mourned for him.</p>
            <p>Mortality is a proper object to invite our
pity, and privation of life alone sufficient to
move compassion in the living. <hi>Weep for the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94537:9"/>
dead,</hi> saith the Son of <hi>Sirach, for he hath lost
the light.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccl. 22. 11.</note> If for no other reason, yet because
a man is dead, and by death deprived of those
comforts which those that live enjoy, they
which survive may providently bewail their
future privation in his present loss. Thus every
Grave-stone bespeaks or expects a tear; as if all
those eyes which had not yet lost their light,
were to pay the tribute of their waters to the
dead Sea. This Fountain Nature never made
in vain, nor to be always sealed up; that heart
is rock which suffers it never to break forth;
and be it so, yet if the rod of <hi>Moses</hi> strike, an
affliction sent from God shall force it. Let us
therefore be ready with our sorrowful expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
when we are invited by sad occasions; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when a Father, who may command
them, calls for them, as that Wise man did, <hi>My
Son, let tears fall down over the dead.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccl. 38. 16.</note> And if pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
authority demands them at the death of
others, it is no filial duty which denyes them to
attend upon a Fathers Funeral. <hi>Ioseph</hi> a man of a
gracious and a tender heart, moved with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
objects of compassion, had a vulgar sorrow
arising from the consideration of mortality; <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi>
a Son full of high affection and of filial du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94537:10"/>
and respect, was touched with a far more
lively sense by the accession of paternity: <hi>And
he made a mourning for his Father:</hi> he made a
mourning for his Father, which begat him;
for his Father, which loved him; for his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which blessed him; for his Father, which
had mourned for him; for his Father, which
came down to dye with him.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>he made a mourning for his Father</hi>
who begat him: had there been no other but
that naked relation, it had carryed with it a
sufficient obligation. There is so great an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
between the Parent and the Childe, that it
cannot break without a deep sensation. He
which hath any grateful apprehension of his
own life received, cannot chuse but sadly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
the loss of that life which gave it. If the
fear of the death of <hi>Croesus,</hi> by a natural miracle,
could untie the tongue of his Son who never
spake before; that man must be miraculously
unnatural, the flood-gates of whose eyes are
not open'd at his Fathers Funerals, though he
never wept before. The gifts of grace doe
not obliterate, but improve nature; and it is
a false perswasion of Adoption, which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us so far to become the sons of God, as to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94537:10"/>
forget that we are the sons of men. <hi>Ioseph</hi> a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
high in the esteem of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> higher in
the favour of God, great in the power of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> greater in the power of the Spirit, yet
he forgets not his filial relation, yet he cannot
deny his natural obligation, but as a pious Son
he payes the last tribute of his duty to <hi>Iacob,
And he made a mourning for his Father</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat
him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>he made a mourning for his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
who loved him. Love, when in an equal,
commandeth love; and this is so just, that fire
doth not more naturally create a flame. In this
the similitude is so great, that there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in the nature of the love produced, and
that which did produce it. But when it first
beginneth in a superior person, the proper ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
which it createth in an inferior, is not of
a single nature, but such a love as is mingled
with duty and respect. The love of God to
man challengeth love from us, but that of such
a nature as cannot be demonstrated but by obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
and that of a Father to his Son is of
the same condition, though not in the same
proportion. The Father loveth first with care
and tenderness, with a proper and a single
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94537:11"/>
love; the Son returns it with another colour
mingled with duty, blended with respect.
Now <hi>Iacob</hi> had many children, and as an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
example he lov'd them all: but among
the rest, there was one clearer and warmer
flame;<note place="margin">Gen. 37. 3.</note> for <hi>he loved</hi> Joseph <hi>more then all his
children:</hi> the off-spring of <hi>Rachel,</hi> the Son of his
old age, the Heir of his Vertues, the Corrector
of his Brethren, the Beloved of God, had a
greater share in <hi>Iacobs</hi> affection then the rest of
his issue. He did not so much prefer his wives
before his hand-maids, he did not so highly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
<hi>Rachel</hi> before <hi>Leah,</hi> as he did esteem <hi>Ioseph</hi>
before the off-spring of them all. This was the
paternal love of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and this was answered
with as high a filial respect in <hi>Ioseph;</hi> which
after death could not otherwise be expressed
then in tears; <hi>And</hi> therefore <hi>he made a mourning
for his Father,</hi> who loved him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>he made a mourning for his Father</hi>
who had blessed him. Blessing is the soveraign
act of God, and the power of benediction like
the power of God. He delegateth this power
unto his Priests, who stand between God
and Man, and bless the Sons of men in
the Name of God. He derives the same upon
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94537:11"/>
our natural Parents, that children honouring
them may expect his blessing upon their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
and prayers. And what greater favour
could we ask of God, then that those persons
who have the most natural affection toward
us, should also have the greatest power to bless
us? Now when <hi>the time drew nigh that</hi> Israel
<hi>must die,</hi> when his body drew nearer to the
Earth, and his soul to Heaven, when his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
were highest, and his words of the greatest
efficacy, <hi>he called unto his Sons, and blessed them,
every one according to his blessing he blessed them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 49. 1, 48.</note>
But as he <hi>loved</hi> Joseph <hi>more then all his Brethren,</hi>
so he blessed him above them all: he made one
Tribe of every Son, and two of him: his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
shew'd it self Rhetorical in his Benediction,
saying, <hi>The blessings of thy Father have prevailed
above the blessings of my Progenitors: unto the
utmost bounds of the everlasting hills they shall be
on the head of</hi> Joseph,<note place="margin">Gen. 49. 26.</note> 
               <hi>and on the crown of the
head of him that was separate from his Brethren.</hi>
Giving this Benediction, <hi>Iacob</hi> dies; receiving
this Blessing, <hi>Ioseph</hi> survives, who can render
no other Retribution after his death, but care of
his Burial, and tears at his Funeral. <hi>And</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>he made a mourning for his Father,</hi> who had
blessed him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:94537:12"/>
Fourthly, <hi>he made a mourning for his Father,</hi>
who had mourned for him. The Parents cares
and Fears are equal, and when any infelicity
besides their children, their griefs are great; and
all these bear a proportion with their love. Now
the love of <hi>Iacob</hi> to <hi>Ioseph</hi> was transcendent,
and being so, it rais'd as high an hatred in the
hearts of his Brethren; by which he was, in
their intention, and in his Fathers opinion,
dead. And now the Funeral is <hi>Ioseph's,</hi> let
us see how <hi>Iacob</hi> does appear.<note place="margin">Gen. 37. 34.</note> 
               <hi>He rent his
clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for his Son many days.</hi> Here is a real demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
upon a supposed death, and a serious
mourning at a feigned Funeral. Had his dearest
Son been dead, yet he might well take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in his numerous off-spring, but he did not;
for <hi>all his Sons and all his Daughters rose up to
comfort him; but he refused to be comforted: and
he said, For I will goe down into the grave unto my
Son mourning; thus his Father wept for him.</hi>
Thus it pleased God to permit this happy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of envious Brethren,<note place="margin">Gen. 37. 35.</note> this pious mistake of
an affectionate Father, not only for a great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of Paternal love, but also to teach all Sons
to measure their griefs at their Fathers death,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94537:12"/>
by a consideration of those sorrows which
their Parents would have expressed, had they
dyed before them. Howsoever <hi>Ioseph</hi> was but
just in this: for <hi>he made a mourning for his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
who had mourn'd for him.</p>
            <p>Lastly, <hi>he made a mourning for his Father,</hi>
who came down to die with him. It was the
old expression of Parents comfort, that at their
deaths they might have their children to close
their eyes; and it hath been equally the desire
of children to be made happy by that occasion,
in shewing the last testimony of their duty at
their Parents death. Now <hi>Iacob,</hi> who upon
the supposed death of <hi>Ioseph,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 37. 35.</note> had said, <hi>I will
goe down into the grave unto my Son;</hi> upon the
certain intelligence of his life and safety, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solveth
to goe down and die with him. For
<hi>when he saw the Waggons which</hi> Joseph <hi>sent,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 45. 27, 28.</note>
and his <hi>spirit revived,</hi> Israel <hi>said, It is enough:</hi>
Joseph <hi>my Son is yet alive, I will goe and see him
before I die:</hi> and when <hi>Ioseph</hi> first <hi>presented
himself unto him</hi> in the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the first
words which he spake were these, <hi>Now let me
die, since I have seen thy face, because thou art
yet alive.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 46. 30.</note> Now he which said at first, <hi>I will
goe and see him before I die,</hi> and when he saw
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94537:13"/>
him, said, <hi>Now let me die,</hi> resolved nothing in
that journey but to die with <hi>Ioseph. And he
made a moursing for his Father,</hi> who came
down to die with him.</p>
            <p>For all these reasons <hi>Ioseph</hi> mourned; <hi>for
his Father,</hi> who begat him, remembring his
natural generation; <hi>for his Father,</hi> who loved
him, not forgetting his singular affection; <hi>for
his Father,</hi> who had blessed him, considering his
double Benediction; <hi>for his Father,</hi> who had
mourned for him, meditating a pious retaliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<hi>for his Father,</hi> who came down to die with
him, embracing the opportunity of a dutiful
expression. And thus I close up the first ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
part of the Text, or the Solemnization of
the Obsequies.</p>
            <p>The Second general Part of the same pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
us with the Continuation of the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
Which ministers a double Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
one as consisting of not many days, the
other as determining how many days. <hi>And
he made a mourning for his Father seven days.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Immediately after <hi>Iacobs</hi> death in <hi>Egypt,</hi>
forty days were fulfilled for his embalming,
<hi>and the</hi> Egyptians <hi>mourned for him threescore and
ten days.</hi> They which have no hope of a life
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94537:13"/>
to come, may extend their griefs for the loss
of this, and equal the days of their mourning
with the years of the life of man. But so tedious
a Funeral Solemnity is a tacite profession of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity.
When <hi>Moses</hi> went up unto the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of <hi>Nebo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 34. 2.</note> and died there, <hi>the children of</hi>
Israel <hi>wept for him in the plains of</hi> Moab <hi>thirty
dayes.</hi> The plains of <hi>Moab</hi> were nearer to the
Land of Promise then <hi>Egypt</hi> was, and some
light of the joys of the life to come was disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
under the Law, and therefore more then
half of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Solemnity was cut off by
the Faith of the <hi>Israelites.</hi> But this Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
Funeral was made in <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Land
of Promise, the Type of Heaven; it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by <hi>Ioseph</hi> a blessed Patriarch, and a
Type of Christ: it continued some days, to
declare his natural affection, but those not
many, to express his religious expectation. Had
it been extended longer, it had demonstrated
more of duty, but less of faith, he had shew'd
himself more a Son, but less a Patriarch. But
now he is become a great Example, in mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some days, of filial duty; in mourning few
days, of Divinity. Which is our first Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:94537:14"/>
The Second leads us to the determinate
number of the days, which are expresly Seven.
<hi>And he made a mourning for his Father seven days.</hi>
The <hi>Iews</hi> took special notice of this act of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi>
and in the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> observed the
number of these days,<note place="margin">Eccl. 22. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Seven days doe men
mourn for him that is dead,</hi> saith the Son of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach;</hi>
and though it be not unto us a law, yet
it is a proper subject of our Observation.</p>
            <p>It was afterward one of the laws of <hi>Moses,
He that toucheth the dead body of any man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Numb. 19. 11.</note> 
               <hi>shall
be unclean seven days.</hi> And therefore well did
<hi>Ioseph</hi> teach the <hi>Israelites</hi> to mourn the same
number of days, that with their tears of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
affection, they might mingle some thoughts
of their natural pollution.</p>
            <p>Again, the number of Seven is the number
of rest,<note place="margin">Exod. 20. 11.</note> 
               <hi>In six days the Lord made Heaven and
Earth,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 2.</note> the Sea, and all that in them is:</hi> and <hi>he rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the Seventh day from all his works which he
had made.</hi> Now <hi>Ioseph</hi> knew that there <hi>remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a rest to the people of God,</hi> he was fully as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
that as the days of the years of his Fathers
pilgrimage were evil, so they ended in rest and
happiness: that as sure as his body was past all
weariness and pain, so his soul was placed
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94537:14"/>
above all possibility of grief or sorrow. A Dove
brought <hi>Noah</hi> word into the Ark that <hi>the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were on the face of the Earth,</hi> and he stay'd
seven days, and then the Dove sent forth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,<note place="margin">Gen. 8. 9, 11.</note>
               <hi>and loe, in her mouth was an Olive leaf
pluckt off, so</hi> Noah <hi>knew that the waters were
abated from off the earth.</hi> If we mourn for the
death of any person departed, and the waters
appear upon the face of man, yet after the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
day, when the Olive leaf is pluckt, when
we have considered the peace, and rest, and joyes
of the souls departed in the fear of God, 'tis time
for the waters to abate, for mourning to
cease.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the number of Seven is the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of holiness: as God rested the seventh day,
so <hi>he blessed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 3.</note> 
               <hi>and hallowea it.</hi> Seven days <hi>Aaron</hi>
and his Sons the Priests were consecrated;
seven days an Atonement was made, and
the Altar was sanctified. Seven days hath <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi>
set apart for his Fathers Funeral, to shew
that mourning for the dead is something sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred,
the tenth of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> mourning,
an act of Piety, a part of Religion. The <hi>Iews</hi>
observed that the Circumcision was deferred till
the eighth day, that a Sabbath might pass up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94537:15"/>
the childe, and so sanctifie it before it was
circumcised; and <hi>Ioseph</hi> appointeth seven days
for mourning, one of which must necessarily
be that day which God blessed and sanctified
in the beginning, to procure a blessing upon
that duty, and to sanctifie his sorrow.</p>
            <p>Upon which seasonable Consideration I
shall take leave to conclude my meditations on
the Text, and apply my self to the present So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity,
which gave the occasion to consider
it: that I may make such use of the work of
this holy day, as may sanctifie the sorrow
of it.</p>
            <p>And now, most Honorable Sir, the <hi>Ioseph</hi>
of this time, the chief Mourner of this day, be
pleased to endeavour the Sanctification of your
mourning by these reflexive Meditations.</p>
            <p>First, learn from hence to meditate upon
your own Mortality, and be now assured, by
this neer and home example, that your self shall
die. This may seem but a cold monition, but
a dull reflexion; every Grave preacheth that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and every Skeleton readeth as good a
Lecture: when we come into the House of
God, our feet will learn thus much, and the
ground we tread upon will thus far instruct
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94537:15"/>
us. 'Tis true, the examples of our mortality
are numerous, but they are not equally effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious;
the nearer our relations are to those
which die, the more we are concerned in their
death, and there is none so neer in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
as that of the Father and the Son.
There is a difference between the language of
the Scriptures, and such a Prophet as <hi>Nathan</hi>
was; one tells us that <hi>all men are sinners,</hi>
the other says,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Thou art the man.</hi> So com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Funerals tell us all men are mortal, but
that of a Father speaketh not only plainly, but
particularly, Thou art so. From his vivacity
the Son receiveth life, and in his death must
read his own departure. 'Tis possible to
imagine an immortal family, and then the
deaths of others concern'd that not: but where
the Father's dead, there can be no pretence or
thought of immortality. Beside, there's some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more then propinquity of nature in a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
Religion teacheth us that our daies are
otherwise bound up in our Parents lives. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the <hi>first Commandement with Promise,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 6. 2.</note>
               <hi>Honor thy Father and thy Mother, that thy daies
may be long in the land:</hi> consider that you have
lost in his death all further opportunity of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94537:16"/>
the hopes of that promise; and that
you stand now only, as to him, upon what
comfort you have in your former duty, and in
your past obedience. Thus learn to fix a
more immediate and more concerning medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of your own mortality, upon the death
of him, in whose life yours was involved both
by a natural and spiritual dependence.</p>
            <p>Secondly, reflect upon that love and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
affection which you have lost; and could
no otherwise be lost, but by losing him, in
whom it lived. Love is of that excellent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that it is esteemed by the best of men,
and accepted from the meanest persons; what
then is the affection of a Father! what is the
purity of that fire which God and Nature kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
in the breast of man! what were the
flames which ever burnt upon the Altar of
your Fathers heart, who never hated any man!
See but the nature of Paternal love in <hi>David;</hi>
who, when <hi>Absalom,</hi> his Son, but a most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
Son, openly sought his life and Crown,
and dyed in that unnatural attempt,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 18. 33.</note> 
               <hi>went up
into his chamber and wept, and as he went, thus
he said, O my Son</hi> Absalom, <hi>my Son, my Son</hi>
Absalom; <hi>would God I had died for thee, O</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:94537:16"/>
Absalom <hi>my Son, my Son:</hi> Measure by this
example the affection you have so lately lost,
who never gave any offence as <hi>Absalom</hi> did,
and yet had in your Fathers eye all the reasons
of love which <hi>Absalom</hi> could have. Know
then you make a mourning, as <hi>Ioseph</hi> did,
for a Father that loved you: remember that
the love of <hi>Iacob</hi> was divided between twelve
Sons, and therefore, though it was high, it
could not be whole and entire to <hi>Ioseph,</hi> as
for many years your Fathers hath been unto
you.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I speak not this out of design to
renew or advance your grief, to tell you what
you have lost alone; but I propound this
privation, that I may contrive it for your imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
endeavouring to stir up the same fire,
and to kindle the same affection in your self,
who now are wholly to be considered in the
same relation. What you were to him, others
are now to you; and what he was to you,
you are now wholly unto them. Before your
natural affection was partly taken up with du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
respect, honor and obedience due to a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from a Son; it is now taken off from
those expressions, as to him, that it may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94537:17"/>
the more entire upon those which come
from you, as you from him. Thus far you
have been the <hi>Ioseph</hi> of the Text, be now
the <hi>Iacob;</hi> that those two great names may be
concealed not only in the Text, but in your
breast. Thus far you have been the better
part of <hi>Absalom,</hi> learn now to be the <hi>David:</hi>
that we may truly say, that tender affection,
that Paternal love, dyed not with your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but survives in you to your and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I desire you to look not only
upon that which you have lost, but also up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that which he hath left behinde him.
Vulgar and common persons, as they carry
nothing out of this world, so they leave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in it: they receive no eminency in
their birth, they acquire none in their life,
they have none when they die, they leave
none at their death. But honorable persons,
as they die like common men, so that only
dieth with them which was common unto
all degrees of men; their singular respects,
the priviledges of their greatness, their honors
survive them, and descend unto their Heirs
with their Inheritance. Give me leave then
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94537:17"/>
yet to speak unto you as to the Heir of your
Fathers honors; consider what the nature and
design of honors are; remember they were first
graciously conferred as a reward of the virtues
of your Ancestors, and were as wisely conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
upon a presumption, and as an encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
of the same virtues in their Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors.
Your Honor knows how long the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of your Family hath been preserved: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
first the vigilant providence and
infinite goodness of God in the preservation
of it, while so many glorious Titles have been
lost, so many Noble Families cut off. Next,
study to preserve and advance it further by
the exercise of those virtues upon which it
was first built, and hath been since continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
endevour to uphold not only your own,
but the very name of Honor in this Age,
in which partly the want of such virtues as
are necessary to support it, partly the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of that power which first gave life unto
it, partly the unreasonableness of foolish men
who endeavour to cast a disesteem upon it, have
too much eclipsed the glory of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:94537:18"/>
Lastly, as I have advised you, with the
Son of <hi>Sirach,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccl. 38. 16, 17.</note> to <hi>let tears fall upon the dead,</hi>
and to <hi>use lamentation as he is worthy;</hi> so I
shall conclude with his following advice,
when that is done, <hi>then comfort thy self for
thy heaviness;</hi> that is, not only be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
after sorrow, that consolation may suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
your griefs, this is the common revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the world: not only be comforted in
lieu of your sorrow, that consolation may
recompense your griefs, that were but a vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
compensation; but take comfort in your
sorrow, and rejoyce in your self that you
have been so happy as to be truly sad. There
is so much deceitfulness in the heart of man,
so much hypocrisie in Funeral mourning, that
you may bless God for your own assurance
of the sincerity of your natural affection,
and religious respect to your Parents, and
take delight in a just expectation, that it
will be rewarded by the future respect of
your children. So having performed the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> who made a mourning for
his Father, you may expect the blessing
of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> given by the mouth of <hi>Iacob</hi> for
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94537:18"/>
whom he mourned,<note place="margin">Gen. 49. 22.</note> 
               <hi>Ioseph is a fruitful bough,
even a fruitful bough by a Well, whose branches
run over the wall.</hi> That this Benediction may
be your Honors portion shall be my constant
prayer,<note place="margin">25.</note> 
               <hi>By the God of thy Father who shall help
thee, and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee
with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep
that lieth under, blessings of the breasts and of the
womb.</hi>
Amen. Amen.</p>
