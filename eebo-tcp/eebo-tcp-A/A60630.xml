         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Faithful VVitneſs.</head>
            <p>GIve ear all ye Inhabitants of the Earth, for theſe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
are true and faithful; be meek and lowly in your
hearts, and how your ears to Wiſdoms voice, and turn
at her reproof; for in your own Ways are you wandering,
where peace you know not; the bowels of compaſsion is free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
opened from the Fathers love, and his good will is made
known amongſt you, in that he is ſtriving with you to turn
you into the right way, that you might walk therein; for he
hath not left himſelf without a Witneſs in all your conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which doth not conſent to your ungodly deeds, but doth
convince you thereof, and bears teſtimony againſt your ways
of vanity, which your minds are exerciſed in, and all your
wicked practices which by you are brought forth from your
vain minds, where you are beſet with ſin, and ſervants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
your carnal minds being at enmity againſt God, and
not ſubjected to his Law, you are at liberty in the fleſh; and
ſatiſfying the luſt thereof; and though you all profeſs to
know God, yet in Works you deny him, and your hearts are
far off from him, therefore is your Worſhip vain; for Gods
fear is not before your eyes; therefore you run to do evil, and
rebels more and more againſt the Lord, wallowing in the
mire of defilements, that pollutes and ſtains your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
your minds being in the earth, and your faces down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
thick Clouds of darkneſs doth compaſs you about,
and the Prince of darkneſs ruleth over you, and leads you
all out of the way, vvhere none doth good; you are a Cage of
unclean Birds, every one follovving the luſt of his own heart,
that you multiply your tranſgreſsions with delightings, and
commits ſin vvith greedineſs, and ſtrengthens your hands in
vvickedneſs; a ſinful Nation you are, and a ſeed of evil
doers, filling up the meaſure of iniquity, and nouriſhing your
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106999:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hearts as in a day of ſlaughter; from the crown of the head
to the ſole of the feet, there is no whole part in you. O! how
long will you ſuffer the Lord to wait that he may ſhew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to you? How often have you rejected his loving kindneſs,
and grieved his holy Spirit? What a day of a patience and
forbearance hath he exerciſed towards you, that you might
have turned unto him, and received his mercy? You are a
ſtiff-necked people, who ſets your ſelves againſt the Lord,
and every viſitation of his love, refuſing to return, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to be reformed; for when you have been called by that
of God in your own conſcience, you have not hearkened; and
when it hath ſmiten, you have refus'd correction; have you not
felt a Witneſs in your own conſcience againſt you, when you
have been acting iniquity, &amp; that it hath judged &amp; condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
you for your ſecret faults, that fearfulneſs hath ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
you &amp; paleneſs of face hath come upon you, when no man
hath been near you, nor no tongue accuſed you, yet that hath
been within that hath numbred up your tranſgreſsions, &amp; ſet
your ſins in order before you, and brought them all to light
in your own conſcience, which the eye of man hath not ſeen,
nor for which the tongue of man could accuſe you; yet they
have appeared freſh in your minds, though many years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they had been committed by you: O conſider what it is
all you that have ſo long outſtood it, and yeild obedience to
the reproof of it, that you may be acquainted with it, and
thereby know it to be Gods faithful Witneſs in your own
conſcience placed againſt ſin, and the hand of Love reached
forth to lead you out of ſin, and ſo come to have communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

under the eternal condemnation thereof; for though it be as

manifeſtation of God which doth diſcover all that in you
which is contrary to its own property, which it hath no fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip
nor communion with; and this can neither be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106999:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nor a deluſion, which doth reprove the natural man in his
natural ſtate, where he is an Enemy to God, a fervant to ſin,
and under the Devils power, by whom he is tempted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
to conſent to the motion of ſin, and to bring forth the
Works of Iniquity, vvhich the Faithful Witneſs doth not
conſent to, but teſtifies againſt, and ſhews it to be evil in the
conſcience of every man, and reproveth thereof, and calls e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man to ſeperate from it as an unclean thing; this you
may all read in your ſelves, in the light which you are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened
withall: Yea drunkards, ſwearers, lyars, and all
prophane perſons, you all have a manifeſtation of God in
you, which doth diſcover your ſins unto you, and brings
them unto your remembrance, and many times ſtrikes you
with fear and terror for the evil of your doings, and brings
you into ſadneſs and mourning for your ſins paſt, which in
the light is made manifeſt unto you in your own conſcience;
and this is not a natural thing, nor a deluſion, but it is Chriſt
the light of the World, who was before the World was, and
is the power of God made manifeſt to deſtroy ſin, and the
Devils Works; and this is he unto whom you are all to look,
and ſtand obedient unto whatſoever he doth command you,
that you may know ſalvation in him, and redemption by him
whoſe Hand of Love is reached forth in this his day of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
that a willingneſs he might beget in you to follow him, &amp;
be guided by the Hand of Love out of darkneſs, where the
god of this World ruleth, who is a deceiver, unto whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions
many are given up, and do believe his lyes, in which
they oppoſe the truth, and are at open enmity with it, being
ſilled with Wrath and Envy againſt it: Now ſuch whoſe deeds
are evil, loves not the light, neither will come to it, but runs
from it, and ſpeaks deſpightfully of it, as the Phariſees did of
him who is the Son of God; and though mighty ſigns and
wonders he did amongſt them, making the blind to ſee, and
the dumb to ſpeak, yet were they filled with envy againſt
him, and ſaid he caſt out Devils by <hi>Beelzebub</hi> the Prince of
Devils, <hi>But he knowing their thoughts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaid unto them, Every king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

ſtand? But if I caſt out Devils by the Spirit of God, then the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God is come unto you;</hi> this you may read <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. And
here you may read whoſe off-spring you are; for this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is fulfilled this day upon this ungodly generation, though
your eyes be blinded that you ſee it not; therefore repent,
and be converted, that the hand of love may lead you, and
that your ſins may be blotted out; for with a light of Chriſt
are you all enlightned, that doth diſcover your ſecrets parts,
and makes manifeſt the counſels of all your hearts, and is
the true light that lighteth every man that comes into the
World, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 9. This is plain Scripture, and you ſay you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Scripture; but you ſay again, This Scripture doth
not ſpeak of a light within; then weigh it wiſely, and ſee how
every man that comes into the World is enlightned, and by it
you may read 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 6. For God who commanded the light to ſhine
out of darkneſs, hath ſhined in our hearts to give the light of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> This is plain Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
and this was the Apoſtles Teſtimony, That the light
ſhone in the heart, (that's within people) and there gave them
the light of the knowledge of Gods glory: But then you ſay,
Theſe were believers, and you grant that believers have a
light of Chriſt in them, but not people in their natural ſtate;
the Apoſtle was once in the natural ſtate, and was a perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of thoſe that did believe in the light, yet was the light
in him, ſhining in the darkneſs, but the darkneſs compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
it not; but when it came to ſhine round him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
him that he was an enemy to it, and kicking againſt it,
he bowed before it, and ſubmitted unto it, and yeilded rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
obedience, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Then did
it ſhine forth of darkneſs, and did ſhine in the heart, in which
the knowledge of Gods glory was made manifeſt; read
this in Gods pure fear, and conſider if you be not where the

<hi>Rom. 1. 19. Becauſe that which may be known of God is manifeſt in

God, was manifeſt in them, and whatſoever doth make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt,

the truth was within them, but they did not believe in it, but
changed it into a lye, Ver. 25. and did not like to retain God
in their knowledge, Ver. 28. Therefore unto vile affection did
God give them up, that they might believe lyes, becauſe they
received not truth in the love of it; this is a Witneſs which

Grace of God appear to all men, by which the love of God
comes to be felt in all that do obey and ſubmits to the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of it; and though there be many in the unbelief, that
ſpeaks unadviſedly of it, neither knowing what they ſay, nor
whereof they affirm, who calls it a natural light, and deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
yet in that love which unto me is freely opened, and
through the Grace which I have received in it, I am conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to bear my Teſtimony, and to declare unto all people,
That the light of Chriſt with which every man is enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is the mighty power of God unto ſalvation to every one
that do believe in it, and a living Witneſs in every mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
is placed, to condemn the Workers of iniquity, who
hath not a love to it, becauſe their deeds are evil; there is no
eſcaping of it, for it is quick and powerful, ſearching, trying
&amp; proving all ſecrets, and the counſels of all hearts are naked
and bare before it: Read this ſoberly, for it is written plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the love of God, who is rich in mercy, and plenteous
in goodneſs and truth, whoſe bowels of compaſsion moveth
in pitty towards a ſinful generation, who hath no pleaſure
that any of you ſhould dye; therefore in this his day doth he
reach forth a hand of love to lead and guide out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
all that turn unto it, and are made willing to be guided
by it. Now all prove your ſelves in the light which you are
enlightened withall, and examine your ſelves truly, and ſee
if you cannot witneſs this teſtimony to be faithful and true,
and feel the Teſtimony of the Spirit bearing witneſs in your
inward parts, unto what is here declared; for unto that of
God in all conſciences I am manifeſt, which doth not conſent
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106999:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>

               </gap>in, who is the Lamb of God, pure and undefiled,
and though you have a general talk amongſt you of Faith in
Chriſt, and living by faith upon him, and that he is your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
and Redeemer, yet you work iniquity daily, and pleads
for ſin term of life, and neither knows ſalvation nor redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
in him, who is the Son of Gods love: Therefore be not
deceived with a vain hope, and groundleſs Faith, which
ſtands onely in Words, when your Works denies your Faith
to be living, being yet in your ſins, for the luſts of the fleſh
you do fulfil, and draws iniquity with Cords of Vanity; look
inward, the light will not deceive you, but manifeſt every
ſecret ſin which lodgeth in your hearts, which you would keep
hidden to have your life in; for though you may not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
all ſin ſo greedily as may ſtand with your hearts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
many things which may be commonly counted pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
yet examine if you have not ſomething ſecretly lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
which your minds are captivated in, and which the light
of Chriſt in your conſciences doth reprove you for; there is
your lover; and that muſt be caſt out, and trodden under
foot, if ever you come to vvitneſs redemption by Chriſt. Some
men are not common Drunkards, as the World calls them,
yet ſecretly hath a love to be in the exceſs, ſome in neither of
theſe, yet hath another lover; So ſome in pride, ſome in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs,
ſome in fooliſh jeſting, and idle talking, ſome in
vain ſports and pleaſures of the World, that ſo you are all
found to have ſome ſecret lover vvhich you vvould not have
tried in the light; novv there is nothing ſo ſecret vvhich ſhall
not come to light, though long you may hide it, and ſmothe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Witneſs of God in your ovvn conſcience, that teſtifies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it; yet to the light muſt every ſecret thing come, vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be good or evil, and in the light be tried and judged
in righteous judgement. Therefore all unto the light give
up your ſelves, and yeild obedience to every motion thereof
in your own conſciences, that you may become followers of
it, in love to it; for if you ſtand in the enmity againſt it, and
be more in love vvith your evil deeds then you are vvith the
light, there vvill be no eſcaping the condemnation of it;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106999:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
therefore let this be a Warning unto you all who live in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
upon the Earth, that you may ceaſe to do evil, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from your iniquities, and break off from your ſins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

            <p>O hearken! hearken! for this is the day of your viſitation,
now is the accepted time; now is Gods Witneſs ſtriving with
you; now is the Hand of Love reached forth unto you; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whilſt it is called to day, harden not your hearts, but
turn unto the Lord who ſtands ready to have mercy upon
you, for therein doth he delight: Now let not your hearts
be hardened to outſtand this day of Viſitation, left the day
of Vengeance and Indignation come upon you, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
you, becauſe mercy you have refuſed. Conſider this all
you who have your life in pride, covetouſneſs, drunkenneſs,
ſwearing, lying, envy and malice, and vanities of the World,
if theſe things be not ſhewed you to be evil by ſomething in
your own conſcience that doth convince you of them, and
reprove you for them, and brings you to an underſtanding
that you ought not to do them; this is the light of Chriſt
which is pure, and hath no communion with darkneſs, nor
the unfruitful Works thereof, but is ſeperated from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,
neither joining with it, nor conſenting to it, but hath
a life in it ſelf which is holy and undefiled, and doth purſue
the evil-doer in judgement, who is at enmity with it, and in
diſobedience to it. O ſink down in Gods fear, and conſider
what a day of patience and forbearance he hath continued
unto you; how long hath he ſpared you? And what a time
of repentance hath he given you? And how many years
hath he ſtriven vvith you, that with the Cords of Love he
might have drawn you, and with the Hand of Love have led
you? But you have rejected it, and caſts love behind your
backs, and likes to retain your evil deeds better, and to love
darkneſs rather: What Viſitations of Gods pure love have
you ſet at nought, that you might walk after the way of your
own hearts, &amp; the luſt of your own eyes, riſing up in rebellion
againſt the pure Witneſs of God in your own conſcience, and

in the fleſh, without reproof: And thus is the juſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
and killed by you, and he reſiſts not; he is rejected
and deſpiſed by you, wounding him by your tranſgreſsions,
and bruiſing him with your iniquities, yet doth not he open
his mouth, but as a Lamb is he led to the ſlaughter; O look
up unto him whom you pierce, and mourn, let your laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be turned into mourning, and your joy into heavineſs;
for he doth not ſo deal with you, but ſuffers and bears in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
and in the bowels of pitty is yet ſtriving with you,
that his goodneſs might lead you to repentance; and thus
doth he love his enemies, and doth good to thoſe that hates

of darkneſs leads you, and deceives you, and brings forth his
Work by you in all manner of ſin and wickedneſs, in which
you are ſerving him, and in which your minds are captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

have you to deny them, and forſake them, and to live ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

might be made fruitful, and grow up to the Lord in it; And
here you had precious diſcoveries, as you ſtood in obedience

to depart, having made known unto you ſomething more

you found to be your duty to walk np unto, that you might
come into liberty, and to ſerve God in the Spirit; and here
you ſtood in Gods fear, and aſsembled together to wait for
the Spirits moving, that it might teach you to ſpeak, and
teach you to pray, and that all your duties might be offered

them, from which you are erred and gone aſtray, and walks
after the imaginations of your own hearts, where your own
Wills leads you, to take up a practice in imitation of what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
have done, who was by the Spirit of Truth guided,

that in the inner man it might teach you, and lead you to
the Lord God, who hath life in himſelf, and gives life unto
all that come unto him, and believes in him, by which all
the children of obedience are refreſhed and ſatiſfied, who
lives by faith, looking for, and waiting to receive thoſe things
which are not ſeen; but that which you take up your reſt in,
and are ſatiſfied with, is viſible and temporal, which is ſeen,

ſpiritual, and cannot be ſeen, which is the ſubſtance, and the
end of all changeable things, not living by Faith, but by
ſight, and contents your ſelves with created refreſhments;
but that which the ſoul hungereth after, and panteth for, is
living Bread that comes down from Heaven, which whoſo
eats, ſhall never dye: for it is the Bread of life, whoſe fleſh is
meat indeed, and whoſe blood is drink indeed! O pure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment
from the Lords preſence! Bleſsed are all that are

Be ye of an underſtanding heart, O ye profeſsors, and
conſider if you have the ſubſtance, and that you live in
Chriſt, and he in you; and that you feel thoſe things you
feed upon to have life in themſelves, and to give life unto
you; if life be not in your Bread and Wine, they are not the
Communion of Chriſts body, nor blood, but bare Bread and
Wine, retaining their own quality and vertue, as created re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments;

which they drank was the Communion of Chriſts Blood;
but I ſay, Examine your ſelves whether you be in the Faith,

was the Communion of Chriſt's body, and the Cup which
they drank, was the Communion of Chriſt's Blood; and you
cannot prove any other thing without inventions; and they
being many, was one Bread, and one Body; but the myſtery
is hid from your eyes, who in your Earthly Wiſdom would

the motion of the Spirit from which the Scriptures were

and ſo the Scriptures came to be given forth, and a true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord

and the Scriptures are profitable where the manifeſtation of

            <p>Therefore be not ſo raſh in your minds, as to call good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,

which is that which changeth not, but is to day as yeſterday,

            <p>And this is the everlaſting truth which from the beginning
hath been made manifeſt through ages and generations, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

to convince and condemn the World for ſinne, who walked
with a froward heart againſt the Lord: Be not deceived, for

and there know that one baptiſm which all believers are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
with, in which they are waſhed and cleanſed, to follow
Chriſt in the regeneration and newneſs of life; He that can
receive it, let him: For you cannot prove by plain Scripture
that Chriſt was a Miniſter of Water Baptiſm, or that he did
command it, or preached it for Doctrine, or preſsed it as a
duty; but he ſent his Diſciples forth to preach the Goſpel of
the Kingdom, and to give that which they had received free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and you cannot prove that when they were thus ſent
forth, that they had received Water-baptiſm; but what was
made manifeſt in them, and which they had received, that
they gave, and declared thereof in Gods power; and this
reached the inward parts, and pricked the hearts of thoſe
that heard it, and brought them to enquire what they might
do; unto whom <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, <hi>Repent, and be baptized every one of
you in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the remiſſion of ſins, and ye
ſhall receive the gift of the holy Ghoſt, Acts</hi> 2. 38. This day is
this Scripture fulfilled, praiſes be unto the Lord God for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
and many are true Witneſses of this baptiſm, whoſe
hearts have been pricked by the eternal living Word in their
own conſcience, that they have been brought to enquire
what they might do; and the living Word hath been obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the reproof thereof, which hath vvrought the godly

the Fountain hath been opened, which waſheth avvay ſin
and uncleanneſs, and baptizeth into the Name of Jeſus
Chriſt, where ſins are remitted, and the gift of the Holy
Ghoſt received: And in this Scripture Water is not once
named, where the Apoſtle preaches the Doctrine of Baptiſm,
and was the firſt which vvas preached after the Holy Ghoſt
fell upon them.</p>
            <p>Therefore be not ſo envious againſt thoſe who witneſs the
truth as they know it in Jeſus, and are baptized with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt and Fire, and hath felt him whoſe Fan is in his

let not their hard heartedneſs be an occcaſion to make

laid it upon him, That what he had in private papers writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,

them and his queries alſo, with the reſt which he had ſaid he

make all his lyes and deceit ſo publick, as in Print, he writes

unto him, and laid upon him to prove publickly, and
ſaith he had proved them all before, as his Writings made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt,
and it was but ſhifting and diſſembling to call for new
