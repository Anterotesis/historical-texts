         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>A worke is done in your daies which no man will beleeue when it shall be reported.</hi> The King of <hi>France</hi> is done to death by the hands of a Monke, for vnto this it fitly may be applied, albeit the Prophet spake properly of another thing,<note place="margin">A loude lie, for neither spake Aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuk of the incarnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, nor Paule of the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, but both of strange and incredible plagues en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing.</note> namely, of the incarnation of our Lord, which exceedeth all wonders and maruailes whatsoeuer, euen as the Apostle <hi>Paule</hi> doth most truely referre the very same words to the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ: when the Prophet speaketh of a worke, he will not be vnderstoode of any vulgar or ordinary matter, but of some rare, some famous and memorable exploite, as where it is saide of the creation of the world, <hi>The heauens are the workes of thy hands</hi>; and againe, <hi>the seauenth day hee rested from all the workes which hee had made:</hi> but where hee saith, <hi>It is done,</hi> it is vsuall in Scripture to vnderstand such a thing as falleth not out by blinde chance, by hap hazard, by fortune, or at all auentures, but by the expresse wil, prouidence, disposition &amp; gouernement of God: as when our Sauiour saith,<note place="margin">Ioh. 14.14.</note>

<pb facs="tcp:19947:5"/>
in regarde of which necessitie, the Prophet <hi>Esa</hi> foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a long time before of the death of Christ, said euen as after it was saide againe, <hi>hee was lead as a sheepe to the slaughter, and as a Lambe before the shearer,</hi>

               <hi>hee opened not his mouth</hi>; And such a thing is this, whereof wee now intreate; this which hath happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in these our dayes, a worke famous, memorable, and almost incredible, a worke not wrought without the speciall proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and gouernement of the almightie; a Monke hath slaine a King,<note place="margin">A sweet note.</note> not a painted King, one figured out vpon a peece of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or vpon a wall, but the King of <hi>France,</hi> in the middle of his army, being hedged in with his campe and garde on euery side, which in deede is such a worke, and so brought about as no man will beleeue it when it shall be reported, and the posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty perhaps will repute it for a fable.</p>
            <p>That a King should dye or should be slaine, men are easily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to thinke it, but that he should thus bee cut off, the world will hardly beleeue it; as that Christ should bee borne of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, we do easily acknowledge it, but if ye adde further that he was borne of a Virgin, my humane wit cannot subscribe vnto it; likewise that Christ should dye it is as easily beleeued, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead to rise againe (because that to a naturall habit once wholy lost, there is no retiring back againe) in the reach of mans capacity it is vnpossible, and by consequence incredible; that a man out of his sleepe, out of his sicknes, out of a sowne, or of an extasie should recouer himselfe againe (for that in the course of nature such things are vsuall) in humane reason we accord vnto it, but a dead man to rise againe in the iudgement of the flesh, it seemed so incredible, that when <hi>Paule</hi> made mention thereof amongst the <hi>Athenian</hi> Philosophers, they vpbraided him as a <hi>setter forth of strange Gods,</hi> and other (as <hi>Luke</hi> reporteth) laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at him, and said, <hi>we will heare thee about this matter againe:</hi> therefore in such things as are not wont to fall out according to the custome of nature and common course of the world,<note place="margin">Acts. 17.32.</note> the Prophet saith that no man will beleeue when report shall bee made, but yet when we remember Gods omnipotent power, and captiuate our vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>dings to the obedience which is through faith, and to the will of Christ we are brought to beleeue, for by this meanes that which naturally was vncredible is become cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible,
<pb facs="tcp:19947:5"/>
therefore I which according to man doo not beleeue that Christ was borne of a Virgin, yet when it is further added, that it was done by the working of the holy Ghost, aboue the compasse of nature, I do verily assent and giue credence to it; and when it is said that Christ rose againe from the dead, according to mans wit, I cannot yeeld vnto it; but when it is saide againe that it was done by a diuine nature which was in him, then doo I most assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly beleeue it. In like manner, albeit according to the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the flesh and mans vnderstanding, it be incredible or at least very vnprobable, that so mighty a Prince in the middest of his campe, so garded with such an armed troupe, should bee slaughtered by the hands of one poore silly Frier, yet when I call to minde on the other side, the most heinous misdemeanour of the King, the particular prouidence of the Almighty ruling in this action, and how strangely and wonderfully God executed his most iust decree against him, then doo I verily and stedfastly beleeue it; for why?<note place="margin">Yes, some of it is to be referred to the diuell.</note> We may not referre so notable and strange a worke to any other cause, then to the especiall prouidence of God (as we vnderstand, that some there bee who ascribe it to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ordinary causes, to fortune and chance, or some such like accidentary euent) but they which narrowly looke into the course of the whole proceedings, may clearely see how many things were brought about, which without the speciall supply of a diuine assistance, could neuer be atchieued of any man. And certainely wee may not thinke that God dooth loosely gouerne the state of Kings and Kingdomes, and other so excellent and weighty affaires; there are in the holy stories of the bible exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of this kinde, to none whereof we can assigne any other au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor then God, but there is none, wherein more clearely shineth the superiour working of God then this which now we haue in hand. Wee reade that <hi>Eleazar</hi> to the end hee might destroy the persecuting King and enemy of Gods people, did put himselfe in danger of ineuitable death, <hi>When as beholding in the conflict one Elephant more conspicuous then the rest,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Maccab. 6.43.44.45.</note> 
               <hi>vpon which the King was like to bee, hee rushed violently amidst the route of the enemies, and making way on both sides came to the beast, gat vnder him, and slew him with his sword, which in the fall fell downe vpon him, and crushed him to death</hi>; and heare for zeale, for valor of minde, and
<pb facs="tcp:19947:6"/>
for the issue of the thing attempted, we finde some resemblance and equality, but for the rest no one thing comparable. <hi>Eleazar</hi> was a profest Souldier, trained vp in armes and in the field, one purposely pickt out for the battaile, and as it oft falleth out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged with boldnes and fury of minde, whereas our Monke was neuer brought vp in such broyles and martiall encounters, but by his trade of life so abhorring from bloud, that happely hee could scarce indure to see himselfe let bloud; hee knew before both his manner of death and place of buriall, as that more like one swallowed vp into the bowels, then pressed down by the fall of the beast he should be intombed in his owne spoyles: but this man was to looke for both death and tortures more bitter than death, such as hee could not dreame of, and little doubted he to lye vnburied: besides many other poyntes of difference that are betweene them. And well knowne likewise is the famous sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the holy woman <hi>Judith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iudith. 8.32.</note> who to set free her owne besieged city and people of God, took in hand an enterprise (God doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les directing her thereunto) about the killing of <hi>Holofernes,</hi> then generall of the enemies forces, and in the end she did effect it: in which attempt albeit there are both many and manifest tokens of a superior direction, yet in the death of this King, and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the citie of <hi>Paris,</hi> wee may see far greater arguments of Gods prouidence, in as much as in the iudgement of man, it was more difficult and impossible than that, for that holy woman o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened her purpose to some of the gouernours, and in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and by their sufferance passed through both the gates and garde of the city, so that she could not be in danger of any search or inquisition, which during the time of assault, is wont to be so straight,<note place="margin">A woman may passe where a slie cannot, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empli gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> into the Popes bed chamber.</note> that scarce a fly may passe by vnexamined: but being amongst the enemies, through whose tentes and seuerall wardes she must needes passe, after some triall and examination, for that she was a woman, &amp; had about her neither letters nor weapons, from whence might grow any suspition, and rendring very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable reasons of her comming to the campe, of her flight and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> her countrey men, she was licensed to passe without any let, so that as well for those causes, as for her sex and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent beautie, shee might be admitted into the presence of so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaste a gouernour, vpon whom being intoxicate with wine, she
<pb facs="tcp:19947:6"/>
might easily wreake her purpose. This did shee, but ours a man of holy orders did both assay and bring about a worke of more weight, full of more encombrances, and wrapt in with so great difficulties &amp; dangers on euery side, as it could be accomplished by no wisdome, nor humane policy, neither by any other meanes but by the manifest appointment and assistance of God: it was requisit that letters of commendation should be procured from them of the contrary faction, it was necessary that hee should passe out by that gate of the citie, which lead vnto the enemies campe, which doubtles was so warded in that troublesome time of the siege, that nothing was vnsuspected, neither was any man suffered to passe to &amp; fro, but after a most streight inquiry what letters he conueyed, what newes he carried, what busines, what weapons hee had: but hee (a wondrous thing) passed through the watches without all examination, &amp; that with letters of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the enemy, which if the citizens had intercepted, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all repriuall or further iudgement he had surely dyed: this was an euident argument of Gods prouidence; but a greater wonder was that, that the same man soone after without all exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination passed through the campe of the enemies likewise, through the sentinells and seuerall watches of the Souldiers, and through the garde which was next the body of the King, and in a word, through the whole armie, which for the most part was compact of hereticks, hee himselfe being a man of holy orders, and clad in a Friers weede, which in the eyes of such men was so odious, that in the places adioyning to <hi>Paris,</hi> which a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had surprised whatsoeuer Monkes they tooke, they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther slaughtered, or else most cruelly intreated; <hi>Iudith</hi> was a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, therefore no whit hated, and yet often examined, neither carried she ought about her which might indanger her, but this man was a Monke, and therefore detested, and came very suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously with a knife prouided for the feate, and that not closed vp in a sheath (which had been more excusable) but altogether na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and hid in his sleeue, which had they bolted out,<note place="margin">The Pope speaketh as if the Frier were still aliue.</note> there had been no way but present execution: these are al so manifest to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of Gods especial prouidence, as no exception can be taken against them, nor could it otherwise be but that God euen blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the eyes of the enemies least they should discrie him, for as

before we said,<note place="margin">I wonder where they were borne which so ascribe them.</note> albeit some there bee who vniustly ascribe these things to chance and fortune, we notwithstanding cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to referre them to any cause but to the will of God, nor truely should I otherwise thinke, but that I haue subdued mine vnderstanding to obedience in Christ, who after so wonderfull a manner, prouided both to set at libertie the citie of <hi>Paris,</hi> which then we vnderstoode to be many wayes in great perplexity and distresse, as also to auenge the most heynous misdeedes of the King, and to take him out of the world, by so vnhappy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prochfull a death: &amp; truely we did heretofore with some griefe, foretel that it would in time fal out, that as he was the last of his house, so was he like to come to some strange &amp; shamefull end, which not onely the Cardinalls of <hi>Ioyeuse,</hi> of <hi>Lenoncort,</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> but the Embassadour likewise, which then was liedger with vs can wel auouch I spake, for why, we cal not the dead, but men aliue to witnes of our words, which all of them full well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: notwithstanding, howsoeuer wee are now enforced to pleade against this haples King, wee doo in no wise touch the Kingdome and royall state of <hi>France,</hi> which as we haue hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, so still hereafter we will prosecute with all fatherly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and honorable regarde, but this we haue spoken of the kings person onely, whose infortunate end hath depriued him of all those rites, which this holy seate, the mother of all the faithfull, and specially of christian Princes, is wont to performe to Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and Kings after their decease, which for him likewise wee had solemnised, but that the Scripture in such a case dooth flatly forbid vs.<note place="margin">1.

               <hi>There is</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Iohn) a sinne vnto death, J say not for that that any man shall pray,</hi> which may be vnderstoode either of the sinne it selfe,<note place="margin">Marke here a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty.</note> as if he should say, for that sinne, or else for the remission of that sinne I will not that any man should pray, because it is vnpardonable; or that which sorteth to the same end, for that man who committeth a sinne vnto death, I wil not that any man should pray, of which kinde likewise our Sauiour Christ in <hi>Matthew</hi> maketh mention,<note place="margin">Matt. 12.32</note> that <hi>to him which sinneth against the holy Ghost, there is no remission either in this world, or in the world to come,</hi> where hee maketh three sortes of sinne, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Father, against the Sonne, and against the holy Ghost, the two former are not so grieuous but pardonable, but the third
<pb facs="tcp:19947:7"/>
is not to be forgiuen: al which difference (as the schoolemen out of the Scriptures deliuer it) ariseth out of the diuersitie of the properties, which are seuerally ascribed to the seuerall persons of the trinity: for albeit as there is the same essence, so there is the same power, wisdome and goodnes of all the persons (as we learne out of the creede of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> when hee saith the father is omnipotent, the Sonne omnipotent, and the holy Ghost om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent) yet by way of attribution vnto the Father is ascribed power, to the Sonne wisdome, and to the holy Ghost loue, each whereof as they are called properties are so proper to euery per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as they cannot be put vpon another, and by the contraries of these properties, wee come to knowe the difference and weight of sinne; the contrarie to power (which is the attribute of the Father) is weakenes, so that whatsoeuer we commit through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie and weakenes of our nature, may be said to be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted against the Father: the contrarie of wisdome is ignorance, through which when a man offendeth, he is saide to offend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Sonne, so that those sinnes which are committed either through mans frailty or ignorance, may easily obteine a pardon: but the third which is loue,<note place="margin">O <hi>Caput logicum,</hi> I neuer knew before that loue and ingratitude were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries.</note> the propertie of the holy Ghost hath for his contrarie ingratitude, a most hatefull sinne, whereby it commeth to passe, that man dooth not acknowledge Gods loue and benefites towards him, but forgetteth, despiseth, and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in hatred of them, and so at length becommeth obstinat and impenitent, and this way men offend more grieuously and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously toward God, then by ignorance or infirmitie: therefore these are called sinnes against the holy Ghost, which because they are not so often &amp; so easily forgiuen, &amp; not without a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter measure of grace, they are reckoned in a sort vnpardonable, when as notwithstanding onely by reason of mans impenitence, they are absolutely and simply vnpardonable; for whatsoeuer is committed in this life, though it be against the holy Ghost, yet by a timely repentance it may be blotted out, but he that perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth vnto the end, leaueth no place for grace and mercy, &amp; for such an offence, or for a man so offending, the Apostle would not that after his death we should pray. And now for that vnto our great griefe, we are giuen to vnderstand that the foresaide King dyed thus impenitent, as namely, amidst a knot of hereticks (for
<pb facs="tcp:19947:8"/>
of such people he had mustered out an army) and likewise for that vpon his death-bed, hee bequeathed the succession of his Kingdome to <hi>Nauarra,</hi> a pronounced and excommunicate he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick, and euen at the last point and gaspe, he coniured both him and such like as were about him, to take vengeance of those whome he suspected to be the authors of his death: for these and such like manifest tokens of impenitencie, our pleasure is that there shall no dead mans rites be solemnised for him, not for that we doo in any sort preiudice the secret iudgement and mercy of God toward him, who was able according to his good pleasure, euen at the very breathing out of his soule, to turne his heart and haue mercy vpon him, but this we speak according to that which came into the outward apparance. Our most bountifull Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, grant that others being admonished by this fearefull exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Gods iustice, may returne into the way of life, and that which hee hath thus in mercy begun, let him in great kindnes continew and accomplish, as we hope he will, that we may yeeld vnto him immortall thankes, for deliuering his Church from so great mischieues and dangers.</p>

When I call to minde the fact of the Monk, I detest and abhorre him; but when I heare the voyce of the Pope, as one that had seene a monster I stand in a maze and wonder at him: and surely good cause there is to wonder.

Was it not enough to disturbe the common peace, to alienate the hearts of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, to stirre vp a restles and factious Rebell, to muster out a league of mutinous and riotous conspirators, to discountenance and ouerbeare a lawfull King, to weaken, to disauthorize, and last of al most furiously to murder him, but presently they which stand in the gate must laugh at it, the drunkards make songs of it, and thou thy selfe <hi>Sixtus</hi> like a parasite vpon a stage applaudest vnto it, <hi>factum pol optime, there, there, so should it goe:</hi> but accursed be they which reioyce in iniquitie,<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:19947:10"/>
but neither was it so strange or vnwonted, but that your diuelish practises doo daily patterne and match it; who was it that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered and presented an empoysoned cup to <hi>Iohn</hi> King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Swinstead</hi> a <hi>Cistercian</hi> Monk, of the order of the <hi>Bernardines?</hi> Who made away young <hi>Charles,</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Phillip</hi> now King of <hi>Spayne:</hi> but the accursed Friers of the order of Saint <hi>Iherome?</hi> For how would they spare to suck the bloud of the Sonne, who imposed it as a penance vpon the Father, to suffer a veyne in his body bee cut, to voyde out a little heretick bloud? Or tell me else, how oft of late your predecessors and your selfe, haue hallowed the hands of Priests and Iesuites to offer violence, and most vnreuerently to rampe vpon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of our Queene? why therefore <hi>(Sixtus)</hi> albeit the worke were odious and accursed, yet was there neither wonder nor no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelty in it, onely this was rare and wonderfull to heare, that <hi>Sixtus</hi> should be a patron and defender of it.</p>

Claudite iam riuos, sat dixit;</hi> And brauely was it spoken, but alacke that such a figure should haue such luck. This figure in rethorick we call a <hi>Preoccupation,</hi> the speciall vse and grace whereof is to preuent an obiection, and yet not euery one, but such as iustly might arise, or els to preuent a false vnderstanding of our words, and yet not euery one, but such as the hearer might easily fall into, as when the Lord by the mouth of <hi>Amos</hi> had sayd, <hi>I will send a famine into the land,</hi>

Image, or of a picture vpon a wall? But these are your popelike Apologies, with friuolous trifles and toyes impertinent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude our patience, to abuse our expectation. And yet when I call to minde againe the Author of this Apologie, and considering it was his holines which wrote it, I cannot say it was altogether needles, for well wee vnderstand your rage and furie to bee such, that many times when ye cannot wreake your selues vppon the man, ye coape and encounter with his shadowe, ye practise vpon his picture; we knowe it <hi>(Sixtus)</hi> we knowe it well whose monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ye haue mangled, whose pictures ye haue martyred, whose Sepulchers ye haue defaced, whose bones ye haue burnt, euen like a fearce and angrie dogge, which because he either cannot or dare not set vpon the man, for very madnes bites vpon a stone: and happely in such a heate your Monke might haue crucified the picture of his King, or els at vnawares he might haue spoyled the Image or sacred Idoll of some deceased Prince; for Images are men, and Idols are a kind of people to. A stranger trauailing sometime to <hi>Rome,</hi> and seeing their Churches, and houses and streates, and euery corner full of Images, reported at his returne that <hi>Rome</hi> had two sorts of people, Men and Images; and so in regard of these double senses that preoccupation was not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether amisse, <hi>A Monke hath slaine a King, not painted or pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpon a wall, but the King of France, in the middle of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</hi>

            <p>But let vs descend vnto the proofes of this Apologie, the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments whereof for that they be entangled one within another, we will for our better proceeding reduce into order, and prosecute them as seuerally and distinctly as we can. In euery place is vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and much ado is made about the prouidence of God, the often inforcing whereof to what conclusion it directly tendeth, I do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>fesse it, I cannot s√©e, but what it should prooue &amp; hath in charge to prooue it self expressely sheweth. <hi>It was a work memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> (sayth <hi>Sixtus) and neuer wrought without the speciall proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the almightie.</hi> And agayne, <hi>We may not referre so notable and straunge a worke to any other cause, then to the speciall proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God.</hi> And agayne, <hi>These are all so manifest tokens of Gods especiall prouidence, as no exception can be taken against them.

<pb facs="tcp:19947:11"/>
vitulo tu dignus:</hi> Why <hi>(Sixtus)</hi> is any man so godlesse to deny the prouidence of God euen in those actions which are of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and lightest accompt? I had thought that his prouidence had extended it selfe euen to Sparrowes,<note place="margin">

But come wee to the poynt: It was not done without the speciall prouidence and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of God; how then? I hope the act is not thereby iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: for if it be, then let <hi>Iudas</hi> triumph as a Saint in heauen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his treacherie was by prouidence, because the Prophet sayd before in the person of Christ, that <hi>he which did eate bread with him had lift vp his heele against him.</hi>

agent and author of euill things: for God is not the author of euill, but onely to be a permitter: &amp; so as vnlesse he permit, the diuell himselfe can do nothing. But ye will say that <hi>Amos</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not of euill workes, but of euill plagues, and so God may be a principall author.

               </note> that is, I haue by prouidence permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the diuell to harden it: so did hee by prouidence deliuer vp his sonne into the hands of <hi>Pilate,</hi> and so did hee put the life of a worthie and lawfull King into the hands of a base and butcherly Frier. But what of this? I graunt these actions in regard of Gods secret counsaile were most iust and lawfull: and yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the authors who had no right or reason to execute them, I say they were iniurious and vnnaturall. Therefore listen <hi>(Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus)</hi> and learne of me to drawe an argument from Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. When I see that God by the hands and ministerie of men hath wrought some straunge and wonderfull worke, I presently conclude, that in regard of him the worke was iust, because euen so it was his good will and pleasure: but for the ministers and instruments of the worke, except I see that they had right to do it, that their end was honest and lawfull in it, and that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by no indirect meanes vnto it, I am not bound to iustifie or commend them: for then were euery theefe and murtherer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit at the barre, because he had to pleade that whatsoeuer he did was ordered by prouidence: and so the prouidence of God shall not onely serue for a stale to iustifie all villanies alreadie commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but to further and helpe out whatsoeuer we shall conceaue or contriue hereafter.</p>
            <p>But lift a while: It was not onely done (sayth he) by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence and appoyntment, but <hi>by the assistance of God:</hi> blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous as thou art, I blush to heare thee: was it not enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend a bold and shameles murtherer, but must thou also bring in God as accessarie and assistant to the fact? I graunt that GOD permitted him: but how shall I knowe, or whence doest thou ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that his helping hand was present with him?

And to shewe that at the first he was enforst to that profession, how oft did he assay to deliuer himselfe by flight, euen as it were repenting his former vowe, groaning vnder the burthen of his profession, and still crying, <hi>Cupio dissolui,</hi> I desire to become a newe man, looking alwayes backe to the lay mans life as <hi>Lots</hi> wife did to <hi>Sodom,</hi> and in a manner wishing hee had b√©en turned into a piller of Salt when he was first made a Frier, and yet this Monke, this Frier <hi>Clement</hi> was the man, the man I say vnto so foule a worke instructed, inspired, nay assisted by God.</p>

               </note> But see the difference; when <hi>Eleazar</hi> vndertooke to ouerthrow <hi>Antiochus,</hi> the author of that Scripture sayth, his end and purpose was to magnifie himselfe, that all the world and after-times might know, that Israel had an <hi>Eleazar,</hi> vnto which end howsoeuer he might successefully arriue, yet he could not but vnlawfully aspire: for wisely the heathen Philosophers teach vs,
<pb facs="tcp:19947:14"/>
that honour is a good thing if it be not sought for: and Christian philosophie teacheth the same, that when it commeth vnlookt for it is the blessing of God; but being ambitiously aymed at, he doth but nicke-name it that calleth it not vaynglorie. Thus haue w√©e noted in <hi>Iudith</hi> an end commendable, but meanes indirect; but in <hi>Eleazar</hi> we can commend neither end nor meanes as lawfull: for neither may a man hang himselfe to pleasure his friends, neither pleasure his friends to get himselfe a name: &amp; yet these examples are cited to appeare as honest witnesses to commend the fact of a murthering parricide. But notwithstanding, howsoeuer there were in them defects and corruptions to blemish and make them appeare vnhonest, yet in this are more and farre more grieuous: for compare them together, and see what inequalitie is betweene them. For first, neither did <hi>Iudith</hi> nor <hi>Eleazar</hi> lay vyolent hands vppon their owne Prince, as did this sauadge Monke vppon the person of <hi>Henry</hi> his Soueraigne Lord and Liedge: neither of them (I say) distayned their hands with the bloud of him to whom they had sworne any fealtie or obedience; neither was <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leazar</hi> to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> nor <hi>Iudith</hi> to <hi>Holofernes,</hi> but as to a stranger, and not so onely but as to a professed enemie, whom in the time of open hostilitie, for the benefite of our King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, wee not onely may, but must, and by discipline of warre are bound to endamage and annoy. Thus see I not what matter here was either to prouoke the Monke to so bloudie an execution, or els to helpe out <hi>Sixtus</hi> with his prophane Apologie. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as they did execute their wrath vppon straunge and forraine Princes, enemies to their state and countrey, so likewise vppon the enemies of God and of his trueth. For well wee knowe that <hi>Antiochus</hi> did abrogate the circumcision, burnt the bookes of the lawe, erected Altars of abomination, and compelled the people to offer vp Swines flesh and vncleane Sacrifices vpon them: and what was the quarrell of <hi>Holofernes</hi> but a matter of religion? because the people refused to adore and reuerence <hi>Nabuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> as a God: from which so grieuous inforcements and charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their consciences, who would not ieopard his life to release and set free his countrey? But neither had your holines nor that shaueling Frier any such cause of grieuance, as might exasperate
<pb facs="tcp:19947:15"/>
and inrage him to such crueltie. For why, a Monke hath slaine a King, not a strange or forraine King, not a sworne or vowed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, not a King of a contrary worship or deuotion, but hee hath slayne his owne King, rightfully raigning, meekely ruling, and wisely gouerning, a King of his owne disposition, profession, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; without pitie cruelly, without conscience wickedly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cause vniustly. Ah <hi>Sixtus,</hi> no maruaile is it though ye seeke to drench your swords in the bloud of protestant Princes, when ye spare not your neerest and dearest friends: full well ye knewe that <hi>Henry</hi> was a bird of your owne brooding, a Catholike of your owne Church: full well ye knewe that he had both faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully serued you, and studiously endeuoured to please you, when as (God knoweth) hee little regarded to please his Creator, and could yee not winke at some fewe offences, but must yee needes proceed to such rigour and extremitie? O pride and tyranny in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable: how better were it to serue a Turke or Pagan, then to beare a burthen in your yoake, from whose rage and furie (when ye list to bee furious) neither King, nor kindred, nor loue, nor respect of religion can priuiledge or defend.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Sixtus</hi> happely will say, he did not compare them for the honestie, but only for the difficultie and wonderment of the work: and certainly for ought I see hee standeth not much vppon the honestie thereof: enough it is for him to wonder at the boldnes of the aduenture, for no other commendation hee giueth to his Monke, then a man might well affoord to a ryotous and desperat ruffen. Therefore, since it cannot bee prooued to bee so honest, let vs trye what courage and valour, what difficulties and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders abounded in it, that it should bee not onely compared, but preferred aboue the hardie aduentures of <hi>Iudith</hi> and <hi>Eleazar,</hi> in regarde of whome, a base and ruffenly Fryer is not onely ioyned to susteyne the comparison as a competent match or corriuall, but most highly magnified as exceeding matchles and supereminent: for so sayth <hi>Sixtus,</hi> that <hi>albeit for zeale and valour of minde, and for the issue of the thing attempted, there were some resemblance or equalitie betweene them, yet for the rest there was no one thing comparable.</hi> But wonderfully hath
<pb facs="tcp:19947:15"/>
his holines ouershot himselfe: for let vs suppose those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to bee as Canonicall as some would they were, and see then not onely to the persons themselues compared, but vnto the spirit of GOD how foule an indignitie is offered: when the holy Ghost in Scripture proposeth to our view some famous example as a patterne of imitation, it lightly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth such a one as no president of antiquitie before, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the posteritie to come shall bee able to affoord the like: as, who can either rayse vp from the memorie of the dead, or summon out an example from men aliue to match with <hi>Iobe</hi> in patience, with <hi>Moses</hi> in meekenes, with <hi>Abraham</hi> in faith, with <hi>Dauid</hi> in courage, with <hi>Samson</hi> in might? And if <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> hauing searched through the Scripture for some rare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and mirror of magnanimitie, did picke out and choose <hi>Eleazar</hi> for the best, I would knowe what warrant his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship had in a Cloyster of Monkes, a nest of Fryers, in a den of Diuells to shewe a better: but what did Fryer <hi>Clement</hi> so renowned or aduentrous that <hi>Eleazar</hi> came so short of him? If ye marke but the manner of proceeding and passing forward to the worke, <hi>Eleazar</hi> did farre surpasse him: for let <hi>Sixtus</hi> bee iudge and tell m√©e whether h√©e did more desperatly aduenture himselfe, which to breake into the middle of an Armie had no other way but as a knowne and open enemie through rankes and millions of men to make passage with his sworde, or h√©e who as a supposed friend came sneaking in a Fryers weede vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, vnharnest, vnweaponed, with a fauning looke, with a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of passeport in his hande, with a string of Beades at his side, with a Crucifixe at his breast, with all habiliments of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, so as no matter of suspition, of feare, of doubt was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred to indanger him, I would knowe of <hi>Sixtus</hi> who did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture most. Yea but (sayth he) <hi>Eleazar was a profest Souldier, trained vp in armes and in the field, whereas our Monke was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer brought vp in such broyles,</hi> and therefore in him it was more admirable whatsoeuer was atchieued. I answer agayne, that as hee was a Souldier, so his attempt was more martiall and Souldierlike, so was it executed without all colour in the
<pb facs="tcp:19947:16"/>
forme and person of a Souldier brauely, by dint of sword vndaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly, in the broade and open field valiantly: and who can admire a close and priuy murderer, whose practises are so abhorring both from humanitie, as nature detesteth them for abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and courage condemneth them as arguments of vndoubted cowardice, and certainely I see not what manhood is required to slaughter a man in his Chamber, which euery base and timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous minde may accomplish, yea euen he <hi>which cannot endure to see himselfe let bloud,</hi> for vnto such kinde of reuenge no man for shame proceedeth, but he who in great faintnes and weakenes of minde, continually meditateth of flight and escape: yea but saith <hi>Sixtus</hi> againe, <hi>Eleazar knew both his manner of death and place of buriall:</hi> why therefore should I thinke that his attempt was more couragious, for where the hope of life is lesse, the aduenture and courage vndoubtedly is more, but hee knew so certainely of his death, that he could likewise diuine of his graue; but hardly I brooke to heare of so foule an vntrueth, that your Frier was so sore afraide <hi>of certaine death, and vncertaine torments,</hi> for why, your factors and agents in the cause, had prouided a double me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine to salue that feare, for so wisely they wrought to prouoke this parricide to resolue vpon execution, that notwithstanding the aduenture in sight were perilous, yet both in regarde of that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy which they had at home contriued, as also of the furtherance and assistance which in the campe of the King they expected, there was a double comfort ministred; at home they had so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, that so many within the walls of <hi>Paris,</hi> as were either knowne, or suspected to be by nere affinity allyed, or by affection carried to fauour either the King or any his ayders and associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, that so many should be apprehended, and laid vp as pledges and hostages, for the safe returne of the Frier, which doubtles would so bridle the fury of the Kings friends, that notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himselfe before were murdered, yet to ransome the liues and liberties of their friends, they would bee content to dismisse the Frier &amp; send him back to <hi>Paris:</hi> againe they perswaded him, that in the Kings own campe there was abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t hope of present assistance to be supplied, for if it so fel out that the King were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht, then so many of his traine as secretly fauored the League
<pb facs="tcp:19947:16"/>
would be present, and at hand to assist him, but the contrary part would be so amazed at the suddaine alteration, that euery man would rather apply his wittes how to saue himselfe, then to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute reuenge vpon the malefactor, and so our brother <hi>Clement</hi> could not choose but scape: this most infallibly is the trueth, this was the perswading and proceeding with the Frier, who in a fooles paradice, and conceite of a certaine returne, <hi>tanquam asi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus ad caedem,</hi> went forward to his worke, which howsoeuer it suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded vnluckily, yet out of doubt better fortune was expected, in regarde of which expectation, I affirme that there was neither imminent danger, nor certaine feare: therefore could not the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture be so ventrous, that Captaine <hi>Eleazar</hi> with Frier <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> should change a corselet to put on a cowle.</p>
            <p>But as we haue compared him with <hi>Eleazar,</hi> let vs ioyne and match him with <hi>Iudith;</hi> I speak not of a matrimoniall coniunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for <hi>Clement</hi> was a votary, neuer wedded to a wife, neuer furnisht with any part of a family, saue onely a few children, but I speake of a ioyning in comparison, for what though compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons bee odious, yet <hi>Eleazar</hi> must goe downe, and <hi>Iudith</hi> must stoope to aduance a bloudy Frier to the skies; therefore as his holines had commended <hi>Eleazar,</hi> so dooth he likewise extoll <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dith,</hi> but both to that end that <hi>Clement</hi> might be superextolled, and commended aboue them both, for both men were inferiour to him, and many wemen haue come vnder him. But see how <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> extenuateth the fact of <hi>Iudith,</hi> which before he had so highly magnified, and all to enlarge the honour of a Monke; <hi>Iudith was a woman, and therefore more gratious, therefore for her sex and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent beautie, might shee bee more easily admitted into the presence of Holofernes;</hi> I smile to thinke how <hi>Sixtus</hi> tickleth at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of <hi>Iudith,</hi> but who would not breake out and laugh, to see how hee beateth himselfe with his owne weapon, for if a Frier were therefore to be commended aboue a Souldier, if <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> aboue <hi>Eleazar,</hi> for that being a man of peace, and neuer trained vp to the field, he had ventured as far as a profest Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, then doubtles by the same reason was <hi>Iudith</hi> to bee prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before <hi>Clement,</hi> for that being a woman, and therefore by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture more timerous, shee attempted as much and more than hee;
<pb facs="tcp:19947:17"/>
yea but consider that as she was a woman, so <hi>she was faire,</hi> and as her sexe on the one side did dispose her to feare, so her beauty on the other side made her secure; yea <hi>Sixtus,</hi> wee consider it very well, and knowe that in <hi>Rome</hi> the argument is forcible; ful well we knowe that your <hi>Lateran</hi> pallace was neuer so surely lockt, but a woman at midnight might boldly and freely haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse. I let passe to speake of <hi>Iohn</hi> the twelft and mistris <hi>Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera,</hi> of Pope <hi>Sergius</hi> and his <hi>Morozia:</hi> I come to the matter, wherein against the beauty of <hi>Iudith,</hi> I doo oppose the professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Clement,</hi> for neuer was woman more welcome to <hi>Holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernes,</hi> then Monkes and Friers were to <hi>Henry.</hi> Ah silly man, I rue to speake it, his deuotion was fantasticall, his affection was ouer foolish to them, and longer doubtles had he liued, if hee had neuer loued, nor reposed any confidence in them, and that those caitifs knew full well, for which most in humanely they repayed him that il; therfore I say there was no cause why a Frier might not as securely aduenture himselfe into the hoast of the King, as did <hi>Iudith</hi> into the tentes of <hi>Holofernes:</hi> therefore consequently there was no cause why his exploite should be extold aboue hers, as farre more difficult and impossible; but what doo we speake of difficulties? <hi>Sixtus</hi> saith it was full of wonders, for after that let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of commendation from them of the contrary faction were fayned, which hee falsely saith <hi>were procured,</hi> see what a wonder fell out: <hi>Frier Clement passed out by that gate of the citie which lead vnto the enemies campe:</hi> O wonderfull, as if he should haue saide, he went but two miles when hee might haue gone ten, hee tooke the nearest way, when he might haue gone the farthest way about, whereas hee might haue passed out at a back or pofierne gate, and so might haue gone from thence to <hi>Rome,</hi> from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Iericho,</hi> from <hi>Iericho</hi> to <hi>Vrsa maior,</hi> from thence to <hi>Tyburne,</hi> from <hi>Tyburne</hi> to the diuell, and from him with a dispensation to the campe of the King: yet he (I say) tooke the nearest way, euen passing out <hi>by that gate of the citie, which lead vnto the enemies campe: Monstrum horrendum,</hi> I thinke there was neuer such a wonder: why <hi>Sixtus</hi> doost thou wonder that he went not the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest way about? Or that hee went to the campe about such a worke, his feete being naturally so swift to shed bloud? Or doost
<pb facs="tcp:19947:17"/>
thou wonder that through that gate especially hee should passe without examination, I should rather haue wondred if any had been so bold to examine him, considering that they who set him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the worke were not so vnwise, but to take order for his safe conduct out of the citie, and so there was as free passage for him out of <hi>Paris,</hi> as there was for <hi>Iudith</hi> out of <hi>Bethulia;</hi> but see, see, here commeth another wonder; <hi>he did not onely passe through the gates of the city, but also through the campe of the enemies, through the seueral watches and sentinells, and through the garde which was next the body of the King;</hi> how say ye by this? Was not this a terrible wonder? His holines meruaileth that the Frier was so freely receaued in the enemies campe, that he was not examined, that hee was not killed, as though no man should looke vpon a Frier, but presently hee should drawe out his dagger and slabbe him: I answer his holines againe, that happely those watchmen and warders did not see him, perhaps he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t inuisible: When the first dag was discharged at the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> a priest in <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp</hi> had suborned a base scullian for the feate, to whome very charily he deliuered a stone of great valew, affirming that while hee had it about him, hee could not choose but goe inuisible, yea though he were in the Princes chamber; I knowe not whether your Frier had such a stone or no; but suppose hee had not, yet comming as an intelligencer for the campe, with letters of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from the friends of the King, in a Friers weede peaceably, with all counterfeit submission friendly, I knowe not why hee should not be as easily admitted into the Kings owne pauilion, as <hi>Iudith</hi> was into the tent of <hi>Holofernes;</hi> but this thing in <hi>Iudith</hi> was wonderfull, which his holines neuer considered, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding she aduentured her selfe as farre as shee did, yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polluted, vnhurt, vntouched, she returned home safe and aliue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and if it had so fallen out with <hi>Clement,</hi> that after the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der committed hee had handsomely escaped and come away, then had it been somewhat, then had it been a wonder: but see the hard hap, when it came to the issue, when it stoode vpon the making or marring, either to proue a wonder or no wonder, why then the miracle was marred, the Monke was slaine: O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodnes, and declare what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb facs="tcp:19947:18"/>
are done among the sonnes of men. But lift againe, me thinkes I heare <hi>Balaams</hi> asse speaking, the Pope is become a Prophet, and to commend this impious act, hee alleageth a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie of his owne, conspiring with the end and fall of the King, <hi>wee did heretofore with some griefe foretell that he was like to come to some strange and shamefull end:</hi> how can wee now but accept his censure vpon the fact, who did so diuinely prophecie and foretell of the fact: but will ye not beleeue that his holines did so prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie? Wil ye require our witnesses? Wil ye put vs to our proofes? Why then <hi>we call to witnes the Cardinalls of Ioyeuse, of Paris, and of Lenoncort.</hi> Ah <hi>Sixtus,</hi> thou canst not so deceaue vs; the signes are many, the proofes are too pregnant against you; your self fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told his end: we beleeue it, for wel might you diuine of his death, whose death your selfe had contriued, and yet bee no more a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, then a Iudge which sitteth vppon the bench, and saith, this thiefe shall dye to morrow, not because hee seeth it by diuination, but because it is in his hand to acquit or condemne him, and so. I may iustly say, that <hi>Sixtus</hi> did not Prophecie but threaten: for if eury prediction should make a Prophet, then should the diuell bee a great one, who beholding the necessary concurrence of the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, dooth many times foretell aright of the effects; in this order <hi>(Sixtus)</hi> and in no other didst thou Prophecie: I apeale to thine owne conscience, when the first relation of the <hi>Guize</hi> his death was made, when the first newes were brought, didst thou not then vow thy selfe to auenge it? Didst thou not afterward contriue the meanes to work it? Didst thou not encourage the Leaguers to it? Didst thou not promise a perpetuall pardon to him that should attempt it? And being now done, hast thou not endited a sweete Apology for it? And yet who now is <hi>Sixtus?</hi> Whome shall men say that he is? Is he not <hi>Elias,</hi> or some one of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets? But not he alone, but many other did thus Prophecie, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom let <hi>Gregory</hi> himselfe be one, who as he now succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>Sixtus</hi> in his seate, so did he exceede him in the murder, for which by a <hi>French</hi> Cardinall, his holines is now notoriously ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed; Thus treacherie and murder is impaled with a triple crowne; thus traitors and murderers sit in <hi>Peters</hi> chaire: beside, we are to note that he did not onely and barely Prophecie it, but
<pb facs="tcp:19947:18"/>
with some griefe and feeling of his fall: alas poore <hi>Sixtus,</hi> how forely his heart was grieued? But shall we pittie him then, or shall wee rather disdaine and detest him? Foule hipocrite and Crocodile as thou art, couldst thou weepe for him, when as thou didst intend so mortally against him? Full well thou mightest haue redressed that griefe, if thou hadst been truely aggrieued; but as <hi>Absolon</hi> feasted <hi>Ammon,</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> kissed Christ, so didst thou lament his fall; for if thou didst indeede lament it, what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thee to endite so triumphing an Apology vpon it, and to erect a Trophe, where greater cause was to write an Epitaph? Why didst thou debarre him from all dirges, masses, and trentalls, from al dead mans rites and funerall solemnities? Did the feare of the losse so afflict thee, and could the losse be so pleasing to thee? Fie <hi>Sixtus,</hi> fie, dissemble not with the world, thy hipocrisie is too manifest, thou didst not prophecie, thou wast not aggrieued, nor canst thou so easily bleare our eyes.</p>
            <p>Hauing thus foolishly mooted and declamed of thine own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall spirit, thou preparest at length by a personall inuectiue to disgordge thy gall agaynst the King, by the impeachment and defamation of whose honour thou addressest thy selfe to conuince the execution done vpon him for iust and warrantable, <hi>His great offences, his shamefull death, his finall impenitencie:</hi> but albeit I must in part confesse some of these as true, yet I loath to see thee raking in the dust of a dead mans bones, whose sinnes if they ought to be buryed in silence, much lesse should they be misrepor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and maliciously amplified. Wee confesse the offences of the King were grieuous, and heynous, and of necessitie we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse what all the world so euidently sawe, because the sinnes of Kings and Princes cannot be vnseene; neither can a citie bee hid that is set vpon a hill: but neuerthelesse, we doo not acknowledge those for sinnes in wreake and reuenge whereof this direfull tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedie was performed. For shall we say his Maiestie did offend in executing iustice vpon that recreant <hi>Guize,</hi> a furious and brayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke rebell, together with <hi>Lodwicke</hi> his brother then Cardinall of <hi>Lorraine?</hi> As though a King may not correct the misdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his subiects, but an Italian Priest shall step out to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termaund and controll it: but how had the <hi>Guize</hi> then misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaned
<pb facs="tcp:19947:19"/>
himselfe, or wherein had he passed beyond his bounds? Ah God, is that now called in question? Or shall wee now begin to endite him, at whose boldnes &amp; rebellion all Kings in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome for these twentie yeares haue stood amazed? whome ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reuerence of authoritie, nor feare of lawes, nor law of nature could keepe within his bounds. But let that goe, wee speake of later attempts, euen of the treacherie which then he intended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the King when he was apprehended and murthered, which vndoubtedly hee had effected, had not his brother <hi>Charles d' Maine</hi> opened &amp; disclosed it before. Yea, but suppose the <hi>Guize</hi> had offended, yet was it tyranny without formall and iudiciall processe of lawe preceding to fall to execution. Indeede (<hi>Sixtus)</hi> it is true when delay is voyd of danger: but if a route of theeues haue so beset my way as I must eyther immediatly slay, or be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly slayne, I hope there is no lawe agaynst me if in that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse I neglect the triall of lawe, and worke out my deliuerance with my sword: for that is a law which we haue not learned, not receaued, not heard, but a lawe which wee haue suckt out of our mothers breasts, in which we were not informed, but bred; not instructed, but inspired; not by discipline composed, but by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture prepared, that no honest way of defending our life and state should bee left vntryed; and shall wee then condemne the speedie execution vppon the <hi>Guize</hi> and <hi>Lodwicke</hi> his brother for vnho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, which could not bee one day deferred without indaungering the life and dignitie of the King? No <hi>(Sixtus)</hi> no, we confesse the offences of the King were grieuous, yet this was no offence: but if we list endite him, wee could vbrayd and charge him with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of greater moment, which albeit w√©e are loath and grieue to doo, yet in regard of that Antichristian tyranny which in his life he practised, and for which he was punished in his death we may not be ouer silent, and so much the lesse for that we would prouoke ye to repentance, least as ye haue exc√©eded him in his sinne, so ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue a greater measure of iudgement.</p>
            <p>When in his life tyme we called to minde how sorely and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly he did afflict the Church, how freely he suffered the confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates of the League to assault and insult vpon them, and how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten himselfe had personally vnsheathed his sword agaynst them,

we could not expect but that though God winked for a time, yet in time he would manifest his iudgements on him, and when the fulnes of time was expired it fell out as wee feared: for so soone as in his last Parliament holden at <hi>Bloys,</hi> he had most wickedly vaunted of his victories agaynst the Church, and boastingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported what harme and scath hee had done them (which was in deed the fulnes of his sinne) this vengeance immediatly fell vpon him, euen as <hi>Sixtus</hi> himselfe (a strange thing to consider) within lesse then a yeare after his Apologie and triumphing in so noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a murther, was dispatcht and taken out of the world: beside, we could report how he secretly encouraged the Leaguers to effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of bloud, how himselfe was vp in armes before the walles of <hi>Rochel,</hi> and that for no other cause but for the Gospell: and that which neuer will be wiped out, how at that notable occision and famous slaughter, surnamed the <hi>great massacre,</hi> being but a strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling boy hee bathed and embrued his hands with innocent bloud, which doubtlesse hath since b√©en so well repayed vpon the heads of the murtherers, as fewe of them consorted in the worke whom God did not after marke out with some notable iudgement, in so much as euen the Catholiks themselues haue obserued that most of them came to euill ends: some of them being afterward endi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, conuicted, and hanged vp for malefactors: others desperatly murthering and hanging themselues, and they who were inriched by the spoyle dying so beggerly, so miserable and poore, as not a peny was left to buy a halter: but for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> who were the slaughter-masters and ringleaders of that ryot, it is playne and manifest how God hath plagued and scourged them, considering how the <hi>Guize</hi> himselfe was prickt &amp; stabd to death, the Duke of <hi>Ioyeuse</hi> was slayne in the battaile at <hi>Coutraz,</hi> the late King <hi>Henry</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered with an infectious knife, and <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>9.</hi> his brother (as some say) poysoned, or dyed as others report of a fluxe of bloud, which at his mouth, his eares, and nostrils, yea at euery passage both vpward and downward issued from him, euen as it were vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting out in his death the bloud which in his life hee had so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly suckt: and certainly God plagued the house of <hi>Valoys,</hi> for that of foure brethren, wherof three successiuely raigned, no seede was left to sit vpon the throne: I speake not of the Marshall <hi>d'

But wonderfull it is to consider, how manifestly God alwayes auenged himselfe vppon the Leaguers and other French persecuters: During the rage and furie agaynst the Saints which were in <hi>Prouence,</hi> in <hi>Merindol</hi> and <hi>Cabriers,</hi> which was soone after the yeare <hi>1530.</hi> how did God note out the chiefe persecuters with some apparant &amp; memorable iudgement? The Lord of <hi>Reuest</hi> high President of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Parliament at <hi>Aix</hi> ran mad and dyed, <hi>Lewis d' Vaine</hi> was drowned in the riuer of <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Bartholomeus Cassaneus</hi> was striken with a sodayn death, <hi>Miniers</hi> Lord of <hi>Opede</hi> being not able to voyd it was burnt with his owne vrine, and with much impatience and blasphemie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed away, <hi>Ihon de Roma</hi> a <hi>Iacobine</hi> Monke and chiefe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitor in this persecution rotted peece meale, and dyed in such stench, as being dead men were fayne with a hooke to dregge him into a ditch: Soone after all this succ√©eded <hi>Henry</hi> the second King of <hi>France,</hi> a grieuous oppressor of the Church, who aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing himselfe at the Turney, was striken with a speare into the brayne and dyed: after him succeeded <hi>Francis</hi> the second, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one yeares raigne and little more, was taken away by an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postume in the head. I speake not of <hi>Francis</hi> the olde Duke of <hi>Guize,</hi> who was slaine by <hi>Poltrat</hi> with a dag before <hi>Orleans,</hi> neither of the Marshall of Saint <hi>Andrewes</hi> who dyed before <hi>Dreux,</hi> nor of the Constable of <hi>France</hi> who was slayne at <hi>Paris,</hi> nor speake I of the late Cardinall of <hi>Lorraine</hi> shamefully strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with a corde, nor of <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Valoys,</hi> whom some report to haue dyed of a venereous contagion; others gather by the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignement of the Lord of <hi>Salceede</hi> that he was subtilly and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly made away: but as they were profest enemies and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Church, so were they scourged for their crueltie: and what shall befall the remainder, since of so cursed a crue so many still remayne, I cannot, I dare not prophecie: but sure I am that God is iust, and will not tolerate so foule offenders to triumph in impunitie.</p>
            <p>Neuerthelesse, what I haue sayd, to this ende haue I sayd it,
<pb facs="tcp:19947:20"/>
that all the world might see that they were not the offences you dreame of, for which GOD deliuered vp this King to so open a iudgement, not for reciding or falling away from you, but rather for cleauing too fast vnto you, for that foolish and indulgent loue he carried toward you, and for his mortall hate agaynst y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church and Saints of God, whom as with other he persecuted, so with other he perished: so that whatsoeuer his offences were, wee all confesse he was a grieuous offender. But how then? shall <hi>Peters</hi> successor therefore say to a Monke, as the holy Ghost sometyme sayd to <hi>Peter, Arise and kill?</hi> Was there no choyce, no discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no difference to bee made?<note place="margin">

We knowe he had highly offended the Maiestie of GOD, but in regard of you we dare auouch him innocent. But suppose he had as deepely offended you; the positiue lawes giue this fauour to an offender, that notwithstanding hee hath been alreadie arraigned, endited, condemned, and at the place of execution stand readie to be executed, yet he that shall offer violence to slay him, shall stand as lyable to lawe as if he had slayne another man. Is there such fauour affoorded to an offender after iudgement, and may ye mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther him whom ye neuer condemned, neuer conuinced, neuer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused? It was requisite that before your rigorous and deadly execution, ye should depose and depriue him from al kingly titles and authoritie; did ye euer so depriue him? It was expedient that
<pb facs="tcp:19947:21"/>
before that depriuation yee should first excommunicate him, for while he was a member of the Church he must n√©edes be the head of his kingdome; did yee euer excommunicate him? Before y√©e could proceed to the Ecclesiasticall censure agaynst him, ye should first haue conuinced him as worthie of it; did ye euer so conuince him? Where was hee conuented? when was it pleaded? who were the witnesses? what were the crimes obiected against him? Forsooth he refused to assist the quarrell of the League: a shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vntrueth; he onely preuented the practises against his person, which were coloured by the quarrell of the League. Yea but he caused the <hi>Guize</hi> be slaine who was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Champion of the Church: good reason there was to doo it, because the Champion of the Church had conuerted his forces which were bestowed for the Church defence, to maintaine &amp; vphold a ciuill quarrell, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the subuersion of the king, and inthroning himselfe in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: beside all this, I speake not of that foule indignitie which he offered the King when he forced him out of <hi>Paris,</hi> such a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous and trayterous deede as could not bee punished with lesse then death: but howsoeuer the King had trespassed, yet being a King he ought to be solemnely endited, and not secretly bought and sould: his cause should be formally heard, and not closely smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered; his iudgement should be publikely notified, and not in a corner contriued; &amp; his person should be arrested, not murthered.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding, sith God in his secret counsaile had so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed it, let vs beare it as we ought, and lay the fault of so foule a murther where in right &amp; equitie we ought. You did foretel it <hi>that he was like to come to some strange &amp; shameful end:</hi> but whose was the shame? a riotous ruffen hath beset the way, an innocent is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapped, his mony is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, his life lost, his body shamefully ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, say foolish Apologizer; whose is the shame? Is this a proofe to approue the murder of a King? Suppose y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tower of <hi>Silo</hi> had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len vpon his head, is he therfore a greater sinner? I tel ye no; hast thou not read it that al things come alike to all, and that the same condition is to the iust and to the wicked, and that many times the wicked liue in prosperity and dye in peace, that their horne is exalted as the Cedar in <hi>Lebanon,</hi> as <hi>Tabor</hi> among the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, when iust and vpright men are as a bottle parcht in the

All cut off by <hi>strange and shamefull ends</hi>; yet no man can conuince either him for a Sinner, or them for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors, and why then should <hi>Henry</hi> so dying be adiudged to die a reprobate? Ah <hi>Sixtus,</hi> now doost thou speake as Antichrist, now doost thou vsurpe the sword and seate of Christ: art thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come to iudge the quick and dead? Is there no remission for his sinne, no pardon to be expected, no praiers to be powred, no hope but hell? Uile murderers, how delight ye in bloud, not content to kill the body, but to adiudge the soule; did yee see his soule descending to the lower partes? did ye heare him desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly crying, my sinne is greater then I am able to beare? Did y√©e heare God pronounce the sentence vpon him; <hi>depart accursed?</hi> but where then is <hi>Sixtus,</hi> and where is <hi>Clement,</hi> if <hi>Henry</hi> be in hell? full well ye teach vs to despaire of your selues, who ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to rob vs of so rich a hope: but rather had I yee should burne me for an heretick at a stake, then enroll me for a Saint in your Calender: vncharitable &amp; vnchristian wretches, condemning for reprobates vnto euerlasting death, whose names God hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the book of life, and canonizing for martirs, whom Turkes and Pagans would detest as murderers: but what ground had <hi>Sixtus</hi> to charge him with finall impenitency? Who euer saw so deepe into his soule? Who knew what sobbes, what gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, what secret griefe might harbor in his heart? But neither did hee sorrow so in silence, as no signe of repentance was left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde: in the presence of the standers by (who with watery eyes beheld him) he made an humble confession of his faith, powred out his praiers to God, receaued the Sacrament, confessed himselfe to a Frier, desired pardon for his sinne, besought God if it might b√©e, to lengthen his dayes, that for his life past, hee might make some amends: s√©e, s√©e, what signes of impenitencie, what tokens of distrust are here? After that, bethinking what might become of his people, he bequeathed them into the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ds of <hi>Nauarra,</hi> whom he specially charged to be carefull ouer them: yea but he cried for vengeance vpon the authors of his death, euen a little before

his death: So cried <hi>Dauid</hi> vpon his death-head against <hi>Ioab</hi> and <hi>Shimei,</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>I haue said it, yee are Gods:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in reason, the remission of such offences must be resigned vp onely to God; could not <hi>Dauid</hi> pardon <hi>Shimei,</hi> which had but barely railed on him, and must <hi>Henry</hi> either pardon a crue of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable conspirators, which so prophanely murdered him, or must he be adiudged to dye impenitent? But how know ye he did not pardon them? Because <hi>he coniured Nauarra, and such as stoode about him, to take vengeance of those whome he surmised to bee the authors of his death:</hi> yea so he might, and yet pardon them to, for when Christ saith, <hi>forgiue,</hi> his meaning is not that euery notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous offender, should be acquit from outward censure of lawe, for that were to peruert iustice, and to ouerthrow all ciuill discipline; but to forgiue him, is to intreate God for him, that his body being punished to the example of other, his soule at the great iudgement might be saued: and certainely if he might punish a traitor in his life, I see no reason why he might not as well doo it at the poynt of death, for why, the time cannot alter the nature of the action, but if it were iniustice to remit him before, hee could not with equitie pardon him then; therefore well might he say to <hi>Nauarra</hi> as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> said to <hi>Salomon: Suffer not those murderers to goe to their graue in peace,</hi> &amp; yet be translated to Heauen as <hi>Dauid</hi> was, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wee nothing doubt, but though his sinnes were as red as scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, &amp; his hands all steyned with the bloud of Martyrs, yet through the aboundant grace of him, who forgaue vnto <hi>Paule</hi> those many
<pb facs="tcp:19947:22"/>
afflictions he said vpon the Church, we assure our selues that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is shewed vnto him, and all is washed away as white as snowe: yea but what will ye say, if beside all this <hi>he bequeathed the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his Kingdome to Nauarra, a pronounced and excommunicate heretick,</hi> must we not then say he dyed in his sinne? Yea there is your griefe, that is it that galleth you: but why should <hi>Nauarra</hi> be excluded, or what should defeate him of his lawful inheritance? Because forsooth, yee had proclaymed him for an heretick, and throwne out a thunderbolt against him; we know ye did, and well we remember how your chiefe agent the <hi>Guize,</hi> being suborned and set on for the worke, went about by an assembly of the estates holden at <hi>Bloys,</hi> to cause him to be publikely declared, as vncape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of al temporal inheritance and succession in <hi>France,</hi> we know ye expelled and cast him out: but what saith Saint <hi>Gregory, saepe qui foras mittitur intus est, &amp; foris est qui intus retinetur:</hi> it may fall out that <hi>Ionas</hi> shall be cast out of the Ship, when <hi>Cham</hi> shall be reserued in the Arke, and yet neither the Arke retaining the one shall make him a member of the Church, nor shall the Sea swallowing vp the other, exclude him from the presence of God: the Pope is like a waspe, no sooner angry, but out commeth a sting, which being out is like a fooles dagger, ratling and snap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping without an edge, and though sometime their censure hath been forcible, yet in these degenerate times, since their first defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and apostacy, they haue stoode in the holy place as idolls, keyes they haue and open not, stings they haue and prick not: the Pope did sometime excommunicate the <hi>Florentines,</hi> when the lawyers notwithstanding pronounced his excommunication voyde; and if your censure against <hi>Nauarra</hi> were as iust as it was famous, why did ye not then satisfie the challenge, which both he and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> demaunded at your hands, wheras immediatly after the sentence of excommunication passed out against them, they called for a general counsaile of christian Princes and Prelates, wherein they promised themselues in person to debate, and that hand to hand against your holines, whether the sentence so passed out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them were lawfull, and vppon lawfull causes pronounced, which challenge as it was published to the whole world, so was it fastened vpon your pallace gate in <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet after so foule

Since the yeare <hi>1586.</hi> fiue seuerall armies haue yee brought into the field against him: thr√©e in <hi>Guyen</hi> and <hi>Poictu,</hi> and two in <hi>Daulphin</hi> and <hi>Auergne:</hi> I speake not of the battaile at <hi>Coutraz, 1587.</hi> nor of the sundry inrodes and incursions, wherewith since his first inuesting with the Crowne, ye haue forreyed out against him; thus ye trie out the trueth, defend your faith, and maintaine your cause: but good God, how hast thou deliuered him from their hands, euen as a bird esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping out of the snare of the fowler? When there was for nomber no equality, for humane power no proportion, when nothing was left to increase any expectation or hope of victory, then didst thou cause him to triumph ouer their tyranny, as <hi>Dauid</hi> treading vpon the carkas of <hi>Golias;</hi> which extraordinary fauour of God, if it were but ordinarily considered, it would turne the fury of a nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber into loyaltie and obedience, and teach them to know, that euen the angells in heauen are vp in armes to garde him, against whom they haue caryed armes so long; but God hath blinded their eyes, that they should not s√©e: I speake it to your shame, ye frantick and vnbridled <hi>Frenchmen:</hi> whome haue yee thus mortally pursued?
