         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>THE enſuing Diſcourſes
are all deſigned for the
Good and Service of the
Religion by Law eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed;
and two of them are ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
adapted to that end by their
Author, that if I have not ſpoiled them
by an ill verſion, there can be no doubt
made, but they will be of great uſe.
Of the Third I beg leave to give ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
a larger Account, becauſe I am a
little more concerned in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:99001:3"/>
THE Life I have collected from
Mr. <hi>Humfrey</hi>'s, who wrote Biſhop
<hi>Jewel</hi>'s Life at large in Quarto. 2. The
Engliſh Life put before his Works which
was pen'd about the Year 1609.
3. Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi>'s Church Hiſtory.
4. Dr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>'s <hi>Eccleſia Anglica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
reſtaurata,</hi> and others who wrote
any thing that related to thoſe times, and
fell into my hands in that ſhort time I
had to finiſh it in. Mr. <hi>Humfrey</hi>'s
alone would have been ſufficient, if he
had obſerved an exact Method in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
this Life; or been altogether free
from Affections. But tho he tell us
Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> kept a Diary of his Life,
and that he had aſſiſtance from Dr.
<hi>Parkhurſt</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Norwich, Aegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius
Lawrence,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Jewel</hi> the
Biſhops Brother, and one Mr. <hi>John
Garbrande</hi> and others; and Printed his
<hi>Piece</hi> in the Year 1573. Which was not
much above two years after the Death
of Biſhop <hi>Jewel,</hi> yet he has not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
any exact order or method in the
<pb facs="tcp:99001:3"/>
Hiſtory of his Life: and he no where
tells us in what Year he was made a Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
or received Orders; nor from whom,
only he tells us Mr. <hi>Harding</hi> took his
Orders at the ſame time. Nor has he
acquainted us when Mr. <hi>Harding</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
his firſt or ſecond <hi>Antapologies,</hi>
nor when the Biſhop went to <hi>Padua,</hi> nor
how long he ſtaid there, nor who were his
Partners in his Viſitation for the Queen.
Nor has he marked almoſt any of the
principal Actions of his Life when they
were done; and tho he mentions a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
at <hi>Paul</hi>'s Croſs, and a Conference
with the Diſſenters not long before his
death, yet he neither tells us the time or
occaſion of either of them, but inſtead
of theſe, runs out into Diſcourſes againſt
<hi>Harding</hi> and others of that Perſwaſion,
which were nothing, or very little to his
purpoſe.</p>
            <p>THE Engliſh Life before his
Works, is only an Extract out of Mr.
<hi>Humfrey</hi>'s Latin Work, but yet was
helpful to me in many Particulars, being
<pb facs="tcp:99001:4"/>
done by a wiſe Man, and who doth not
ſeem to have been biaſſed as the former
was; who makes it his buſineſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
both the Church of <hi>England</hi> and
Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> as wonderous Friends to
the Churches of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> that is,
to the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> becauſe he, Good
Man, was one himſelf, tho not ſo mad
as thoſe that followed; and upon this
very account I do ſuſpect he has left out
many things that he might have related,
and would have afforded great light to
the Church Hiſtory of thoſe times, and
eſpecially to Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi>'s Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fuller</hi> is barren in his Relations of
thoſe times, the Biſhop lived after his
Conſecration, tho he afforded me ſome
good helps: Dr. <hi>Burnett</hi> has conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
his Hiſtory but a little way in Queen
<hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, and Dr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>
ended his with the beginning of the Year
1566. which was about Five Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the death of Biſhop <hi>Jewel,</hi> and
I have neither time nor leiſure, nor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
to ſearch the Records of thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:99001:4"/>
times, and compare the Editions of Books
and other things by which this Life might
have been put into a better Method, as to
the timing of things.</p>
            <p>And beſides all this, it were perhaps
indecent to put a long Life before two
ſuch ſmall Tractates as I am to entertain
my Reader with; but yet I hope the Life,
ſuch as it is, will give ſome light to the
Diſcourſes, and raiſe a venerable Idea
of this good Biſhop in the Readers mind,
which were the things I chiefly aimed at in
the Writing of it.</p>
            <p>As to the Pieces, the first of theſe
the Apology was written in <hi>Latin</hi> in the
beginning of the Year 1562. or the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
end of the foregoing Year, and was
occaſioned by Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth, his
calling the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Nuncio <hi>Martiningo</hi> to invite
the Queen to it, and the interpoſition of
moſt of the greateſt Princes of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
who wrote to the Queen to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Nuncio and ſubmit to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.
Whereupon it was thought but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
<pb facs="tcp:99001:5"/>
to give the World an account of
what we had done in the preceding Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and the reaſons of it, and to
retort the many Accuſations brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
our Church by the Papiſts. And
therefore it was but reaſonable that it
ſhould be in <hi>Latin,</hi> that being the moſt
common Language, and underſtood by
the Learned Men of all Nations, and
accordingly it found entertainment in all
places, and was read in them. Which
is more perhaps than can be ſaid of any
other Book written for our Church ſince
the Reformation.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Harding</hi> had a great Quarrel
againſt it, becauſe it was not inſcribed
neither to the Pope nor to the Council.
But there being no reaſon to make them
our Judges, and they having no right to
claim that Authority over us, it had been
a great overſight to have made any ſuch
Inſcription, which would have been a kind
of making them what they had neither
right nor reaſon to expect to be, and from
whom we could expect no Juſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:99001:5"/>
The Natives had without doubt a
great deſire to ſee what was in this Book
which then made ſo great a noiſe in the
World; and the Learned Men being then
otherwiſe imployed, a Lady who was one
of the moſt Learned of the Age, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
that task, and made a very Faithful
and perhaps Elegant Verſion of it for the
time when it was made.</p>
            <p>She was then Wife to Sir <hi>Nicholas
Bacon</hi> Lord Keeper of the Great Seal
of <hi>England,</hi> ſecond Daughter to Sir
<hi>Anthony Cooke</hi> Knight, one of the
Tutors to King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth,
who being an excellent Scholar, had taken
care to improve his Five Daughters ſo
much in Learning,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lloyd</hi>'s State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthies <hi>p.</hi> 374</note> that they became the
Wonders of the Age, and were ſought
in Marriage by great Men more for their
natural and acquired Endowments and
Beauty, than for their Portions, tho
they did not want that neither. <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi>
the eldeſt married <hi>William Cecil</hi>
Lord Treaſurer of <hi>England; Anne</hi>
the ſecond was this Lady <hi>Bacon; Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:99001:6"/>
the third married Sir <hi>Henry
Killigrew; Elizabeth</hi> the fourth
married Sir <hi>Thomas Hobby;</hi> the fifth
whoſe name is loſt, married Sir <hi>Ralph
Rowlet,</hi> all three Knights and Men of
great Eſtates and Eſteem.</p>
            <p>This Verſion was made ſoon after the
Piece was first printed, tho I cannot tell
preciſely in what year, for Mr. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi>
tells us Mr. <hi>Harding</hi> anſwered
the Engliſh Book, and it is ſo well done,
that I profeſs I could never have made ſo
good a Verſion as I have, if I had not
been aſſiſted by it; but then our Langu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
is ſo much refin'd and exalted ſince
that time (which is above an hundred
years,) that it was perhaps neceſſary to
put it into a more modiſh dreſs, in order
to recommend it to the reading of thoſe
who do not much admire excellent Senſe in
a harſh and obſolete ſtile, and for this
reaſon only have very many Books of
late been new turn'd; and they of
<hi>France</hi> who put out the Elegant
<hi>Mons Verſion</hi> of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb facs="tcp:99001:6"/>
give no other Reaſon for it than
this.</p>
            <p>The Epiſtle to <hi>Seignior Scipio</hi> was
written ſoon after the Apology, and to
a private <hi>Venetian</hi> Gentleman in a
more free and friendly way, as not being
at all intended for the Publick. It was
firſt Printed in <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> at
the end of the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> who
made that Verſion I know not, but it is
a very good one, and if I might have
had ſo much liberty, I would only have
altered a very few words in it, and ſo
have Re-printed it again. But not
daring to take that liberty with what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to other men, I have done it over
again as well as I could, and perhaps the
Reader will not be diſpleaſed to ſee it in
the ſame ſtile with the Apology, in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
as well as <hi>Latin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now who can enough deplore the
Blindneſs, Pride and Partiality of thoſe
Men, who being led by Intereſt, and hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wink'd
by Ignorance, did at firſt imploy
all the diſingenuous Arts that ſpite and
<pb facs="tcp:99001:7"/>
prejudice could furniſh them with, to
ruine this moſt Excellent, Apoſtolical,
and Primitive Church; or force her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
back to the State of Corruption, out
of which with ſo much labour, difficulty,
and danger, ſhe was then riſing.</p>
            <p>But there is ſome allowance to be
made for the miſinformation of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
who being ſeparated from us by
the <hi>Ocean,</hi> were forced to take ſuch
Accounts as were given them by others;
and 1. being too apt to believe the reports
of their own Prieſts, whoſe Intereſt it was
to blacken her what they could; And 2.
thoſe of our own Fugitives, who made the
caſe much worſe than they themſelves
thought it, that they might obtain the
more pity, and conſequently the better
Relief and Proviſion abroad, which is
wont to be afforded to all thoſe that fly
for Religion, amongſt thoſe of the ſame
Faith; 3. And alſo ſuſpecting the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
of the Relations made by our
Miniſters in foreign Courts, 4. And
of all our Travellers who ſtuck to, and

would confirm the Engliſh Liturgy by
his Authority, and grant the Engliſh
the uſe of the Sacrament under both kinds,
provided the Queen would unite her ſelf to
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and acknowledge
the Primacy of the <hi>Roman</hi> See. Since
that time nothing has been added that
might in the leaſt offend them. Why
then do they act contrary to their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors?
Why do they pretend more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
than either their Fore-fathers or
the Pope: ten Years was a ſufficient time
for them to have found out the Hereſie in,
if there had been any in the Eſtabliſhment.
And we all know their Separation was not
upon any ſcruple of Conſcience they had,
but in obedience to the Popes Bull.<note place="margin">1569. 13 Eli. e. a.</note> The
Pope in the mean time did what he did
purely out of worldly Intereſt and Policy,
to advance his own Grandure and Wealth
at their cost and trouble. If he could
have ſecured this, the Liturgy and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſhould
have been own'd for Catholick, and have
<pb facs="tcp:99001:9"/>
been confirm'd by his Holineſſes Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
But what is this to them? Are they
bound to promote his Temporal Intereſt
with their Ruine, and the diſquiet of
their Country? Or how come they to be
more obliged to ſeparate from the Church,
than to Rebel againſt the Crown, ſeeing
the ſame Pope commanded both, and for
the ſame ends, and is as infallible in the
one as in the other?</p>
            <p>But this is not our only Calamity, about
the ſame time another ſort of Men ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
too upon direct contrary Pretences;
Why 'tis our Antiquity, our Decency,
our too great reſemblance to the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> that offends them. We are
not ſufficiently purged for theſe Pure
Men to joyn with; we have too little of
the Primitive Church cryes the one, too
much ſays the other; too few Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
too much ſimplicity ſay the Papiſts;
too many of the firſt, too little of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
cry the Diſſenters. Thus was truth
ever perſecuted on both ſides, Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
betwixt two Thieves, the Primitive
<pb facs="tcp:99001:9"/>
Church perſecuted by the Pagans on one
ſide, and the Iews on the other. I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
thy Truth and Moderation, O dear
and Holy Mother, who doſt ſo exactly
reſemble thy God and Saviour, and the
Primitive Church both in thy Truth and
Piety, and in thy Sufferings too which
are thy Glory!</p>
            <p>But what ſhall I ſay for our Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
who have run into ſuch horrible
Crimes as Schiſm and Rebellion, only on
pretence to avoid that Popery, that Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
that was only in their own Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and Prejudices? How can one and
the ſame Church be perſecuted juſtly for
being too much and too little Reformed?
Why have you ſeparated from her Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
and Rites, who pretend to imbrace her
Doctrines? Or if you muſt needs ſeparate,
why yet ſhould you imbrue your hands in
the Blood of your Soveraign and fellow
Subjects on that account? Suppoſing you
were in the right, this would not juſtifie
you, Chriſt never propagated his Church
by Blood and Treaſon, but by Sufferings
and Obedience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:99001:10"/>
The truth is, this Church hath been
perſecuted becauſe ſhe alone of all the
Churches in <hi>Europe,</hi> has had the Bleſſing
and ſingular Favour of God to reform
with Prudence, Moderation, and an exact
and regular Conduct, after great and wiſe
Deliberations, by the conſent of our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
Convocations, States, and Princes,
without Tumults or haſty Counſels; and
accordingly here was nothing changed but
upon good Advice, after the moſt irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtable
Conviction that it was contrary to
the Word of God, the Sentiments of the
Holy Fathers and Councils, and the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the truly Primitive and Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Church. So that the Papiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
do even envy our Primitive Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
Government, and Diſcipline, and
both fear and hate us more than any other
of the Reformed Churches. <hi>I could be
contented</hi> (ſaid a great Man of that
Perſwaſion) <hi>there were no Prieſts</hi>
(i. e. Popiſh Prieſs) <hi>in</hi> England, <hi>ſo
there were no Biſhops there.</hi> This
and our excellent Liturgy, our decent Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
<pb facs="tcp:99001:10"/>
and our excellent order moves
their envy; they are the ſame things that
have raiſed the Spleens and Animoſities
of the other ſide, with whom whatever is
older than <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> is
preſently Popery and muſt be deſtroyed.
Tell them that Epiſcopacy was ſettled in
all Churches in the days of the very Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
and by them; and they reply the
Myſtery of Iniquity began then to work,
intimating if not affirming, that this Holy
Order was a part of it. So that they will
rather traduce theſe Holy Men, who ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
their Bloods for Jeſus Chriſt and
his Church, of Pride, Ambition, and a
too great Love of Rule, than allow the
Eſtabliſhments of our Church. Nay they
will rather root out the Monarchy, becauſe
ſupported by, and upholding Epiſcopacy,
than ſhew any the leaſt Reverence to the
Church, in obedience to our Laws and
Princes.</p>
            <p>So that leaving theſe implacable ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemned
Enemies, give me leave, O ye
Loyal and Religious Sons of this Holy
<pb facs="tcp:99001:11"/>
and ever perſecuted Church, to make my
laſt Addreſs and Application to you. You

you ſee the reaſon of it; you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

on both ſides; you have read the one, and
your Eyes have ſeen the other; rouſe up
then, and take effectual care of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
this perſecuted Spouſe of Chriſt.
Stretch out your hands to Heaven by
humble and fervent Prayers, and implore
the Aſſiſtance of the moſt Holy God,
for her ſafety and Protection againſt all
her Enemies.</p>
            <p>Let the Virtue, Piety, and Holineſs of
your Lives, aſſure the World that you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
this Holy Religion in good earneſt,
and that you do not diſſemble either with
God or Man in it, but are ſincere and
reſolved to live and dye in this profeſſion.</p>
            <p>Put thoſe Laws we now have in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
duly and regularly, and with Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
and Mercy, not out of Bitterneſs
and Paſſion, but out of Conſcience and a
true fear of God, and care of his Church;
<pb facs="tcp:99001:11"/>
that all the World may ſee it is nothing
but a ſenſe of your Duties, and a Zeal
for God, that makes you active and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently

            <p>And as far as you ſhall have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,

your names with Eulogies and Honour
for ever.</p>
            <p>And if any thing in theſe Papers may

LIFE
OF THE
Right Reverend Father in God
DR. JOHN JEWEL
Lord Biſhop of
SARISBURY.</head>
            <p>THO Truth and Reaſon may
juſtly claim the Priviledge of
a kind reception, whoever
brings them; yet ſuch is the
Nature of Mankind, that the
Face of a Stranger is ever ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
with a little more than ordinary At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
as if Men thought generally that in
it were the moſt lively Characters of
what they ſeek to know, the Soul and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of a Man; now becauſe this is not to be
expected at the firſt ſight, in Books where
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99001:13"/>
yet it is moſt eagerly deſired; Men have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to ſupply that defect with Pictures;
and (which affords much more ſatisfaction)
by premiſing the Lives and Characters of the
Authors, which gives the Reader a truer and
more laſting <hi>Idea</hi> of Men, than it is poſſible
for Penſils and Colours to attain to.</p>
            <p>The Author of the enſuing <hi>Tracts</hi> ought
to be ſo well known to all <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, that
his Name alone ſhould have given a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Commendation to any thing that
can claim a deſcent from him: But it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now above an hundred years ſince his
death, and his Works which were for a long
time chained up in all Churches, being now
ſuperannuated or neglected, it may not be
an unſeaſonable piece of Service to the
Church, to revive the Memory of this great
Man, the ſtout and invincible Champion
of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> who loſing the
opportunity of ſacrificing his Life for her in
the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> did it with more
advantage to us, and pains to himſelf, under
her glorious Succeſſor, when he ſo freely
ſpent himſelf in her Service, that having
waſted his thin Body by exceſſive Labour and
Study, he died young, but full of good Works
and Glory.</p>
            <p>He was born the 24<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> in the
year of our Lord 1522. at <hi>Buden</hi> in the
Pariſh of <hi>Berinber</hi> in the County of <hi>Devon;</hi>
and tho a younger Brother, yet inherited
his Fathers Name. His Mother was a <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamie,</hi>
and he had ſo great an eſteem for
it and her, that he engraved it on his Signet,
<hi>and had it always imprinted in his heart;</hi> a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99001:13"/>
Teſtimony both of her Virtue and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to him.</p>
            <p>His Father was a Gentleman deſcended
rather of an Ancient and Good, than very
Rich Family. It is obſerved that his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors
had injoyed that Eſtate for almoſt
two hundred years before the Birth of this
great Man. And yet ſuch was the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of his Children, that it is no wonder
if this, when young, wanted the aſſiſtance
of Good men for the promoting of his
Studies; for it is ſaid his Father left ten
Children between Sons and Daughters behind
him.</p>
            <p>This <hi>John Jewel</hi> proving a Lad of preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Parts, and of a ſweet and induſtrious
Nature and Temper, was from his Youth
dedicated to Learning; and with great care
cultivated by his Parents and Maſters, which
he took ſo well, that at the entrance of
the Thirteenth year of his Age, about the
Feaſt of St. <hi>James,</hi> he was admitted in <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
Colledge in <hi>Oxon,</hi> under one Mr. <hi>Peter
Burrey,</hi> a Man neither of any great Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
nor much addicted to the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which then (in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi>
the Eighth) went on but ſlowly, and with
much irregularity in its Motions. But we
are yet beholding to his firſt Tutor for this,
that he committed this <hi>Jewel</hi> to Mr. <hi>John
Parkhurſt</hi> a Fellow of the ſame Colledge,
and afterwards firſt Miniſter of <hi>Cleave,</hi> and
then Biſhop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> who was a Man
both of more Learning and of a better
Faith; and prudently inſtilled together with
his other Learning, thoſe excellent Principles
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99001:14"/>
into this Young Gentleman, which afterwards
made him the Darling and Wonder of his Age.</p>
            <p>DURING his continuance in this Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,<note place="margin">In the Engliſh Life before his Works, is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Witney.</hi>
               </note>
a Plague happening in <hi>Oxon,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
to a place called <hi>Croxham,</hi> where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lodged in a low Room, and ſtudying
hard in the night, he got a lameneſs by a
Cold which attended him to his Grave; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſpent almoſt four years in this Colledge,
the 19<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt Anno Domini</hi> 1539. the
One and thirtieth of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, in
the Seventeenth year of his Age, he was, by
the Procurement of one Mr. <hi>Slater,</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Burrey</hi> and Mr. <hi>Parkhurſt</hi> his two Tutors,
removed into <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> Colledge in the
ſame Univerſity, where, I ſuppoſe, he met
with ſomething of an encouragement; but
it is much more certain he met with Envy
from his Equals, who often ſuppreſſed his
ingenious Exerciſes, and read others that
were more like their own.</p>
            <p>THE twentieth day of <hi>October</hi> in the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
year, he took his firſt Degree of
Batchelor of Arts, with a great and general
Applauſe; when he proſecuted his Studies
with more vigor than before, beginning
them at four in the Morning, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
them till ten and night, ſo that he
ſeemed to need ſome body to put him in mind
of eating.</p>
            <p>BEING now attained to a great Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
for Learning, he began to inſtruct
other, and amongſt and reſt <hi>Anthony Park<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurſt</hi>
was committed to his care by Mr. <hi>John
Parkhurſt</hi> his Tuto, which was a great Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his great Worth and Induſtry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:99001:14"/>
BEING thus imployed, he was choſen
Reader of Humanity and Rhetorick of his
own Colledge, and he managed this place
ſeven years with great Applauſe and Honor.
His Example taught more than any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
could; for he was a great admirer of
<hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Cicero,</hi> and read all <hi>Eraſmus</hi> his
Works, and imitated them too, for it was
his cuſtom to write ſomething every day;
and it was his common ſaying, that men
<hi>acquired Learning more by a frequent exerciſing
their Pens, than by reading many Books.</hi> He
affected ever rather to expreſs himſelf fluent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
neatly, and with great weight of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and ſtrength of Reaſon, than in hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after the Flowers of Rhetorick, and the
Cadences of Words, tho he underſtood them,
no man better, and wrote a Dialogue in which
he comprehended the ſum of the Art of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick.</p>
            <p>THE ninth of <hi>February</hi> 1544. he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced
Maſter of Arts, the Charge of it
being born by his good Tutor Mr. <hi>Park<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurſt,</hi>
who had then the Rich Rectory of
<hi>Cleve</hi> in the Dioceſs of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> which is of
better value than ſome of our ſmaller Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks.
Nor was this the only inſtance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he did partake of this good mans Bounty,
for he was wont twice or thrice in a year to
invite him to his Houſe, and not diſmiſs him
without Preſents, Money, and other things
that were neceſſary for the carrying on his
Studies. And one time above the reſt,
coming into his Chamber in the Morning,
when he was to go back to the Univerſity,
he ſeiſed upon his and his Companions
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99001:15"/>
Purſes, ſaying, <hi>What Money, I wonder, have
theſe miſerable, Beggarly</hi> Oxfordians? And
finding them pittifully lean and empty, ſtuffed
them With Money, till they became both fat
and weighty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>EDWARD</hi> the Sixth ſucceeding his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the 28<hi>th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> 1546. the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
went on more regularly and ſwiftly,<note place="margin">November 1548.</note>
and <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> being by that Prince called
out of <hi>Germany,</hi> and made Profeſſor of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
at <hi>Oxon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jewel</hi> was one of his moſt
conſtant hearers; and by the help of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
which he had invented for his own
uſe, took all his Lectures almoſt as perfectly as
he ſpoke them.</p>
            <p>About this time one Dr. <hi>Richard Smith,</hi>
Predeceſſor to <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> in that Chair at
<hi>Oxon,</hi> who was more a Sophiſter than a
Divine, made an inſult upon <hi>Peter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,</hi>
and interrupted him publickly and
unexpectedly in his Lecture: the <hi>German</hi> was
not to be baffled by a ſurprize, but extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore
recollected his Lecture, and defended
it with a great preſence of mind, the two
Parties in the Schools being juſt upon the
point of a Tumult, the Proteſtants for the
preſent Profeſſor, and the Papiſts for the old
one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> nettled with this affront,
challenged <hi>Smith</hi> to diſpute with him publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and appointed him a day: But <hi>Smith</hi>
fearing to be called in queſtion for this
uproar,<note place="margin">This Diſpute began the 28<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May, Anno Chriſti</hi> 1549. and laſted five days.</note> fled before the time to
St. <hi>Andrews</hi> in <hi>Scotland.</hi> But
then <hi>Treſham</hi> and <hi>Chadſy,</hi> two
Popiſh Doctors, and one <hi>Morgan</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:99001:15"/>
entered the Liſts againſt <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> and
there was a very ſharp but regular Diſpute
betwixt them concerning the <hi>Lords-Supper.</hi>
And Mr. <hi>Jewel</hi> having then a large ſhare
in <hi>Peter Martyrs</hi> affections, was by him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to take the whole Diſputation in
Writing, which was printed in the year 1649.
for the regulating this Diſputation, the
Council ſent to <hi>Oxon, Henry</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln,</hi>
Dr. <hi>R. Cox</hi> Chancellor of that Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
Dr. <hi>Simon Haines, Richard Moriſon</hi> Eſqe;
and Dr. <hi>Chriſtopher Neviſon</hi> Commiſſioners and
Moderators.</p>
            <p>In the year 1551. Mr. <hi>Jewel</hi> took his
Degree of <hi>Bachelor</hi> of Divinity,<note place="margin">1551.</note> whon he
preached an excellent Latin Sermon, which
is extant almoſt perfect; taking for his Text
the words of St. <hi>Peter, Ep.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 11.
<hi>If any man ſpeak, Let him ſpeak as the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of God,</hi> &amp;c. Upon which words he
raiſed ſuch excellent Doctrines, and made
ſuch wiſe and holy Reflections in ſo pure and
elegant a ſtile, as ſatisfied all the World of his
great Ability and Deſerts.</p>
            <p>In the ſame time Mr. <hi>Jewel</hi> took a ſmall
Living near <hi>Oxon</hi> called <hi>Sunningwell,</hi> more
out of a deſire to do good, than for the
Sallary which was but ſmall, whither he
went once a Fortnight on Foot, tho he was
lame, and it was troubleſome to him to walk;
and at the ſame time preached frequently both
privately in his own Colledge, and publickly
in the Univerſity.</p>
            <p>BESIDES his old Friend Mr. <hi>Parkhurſt,</hi>

one of the firſt that felt the fury of this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt,
and before any Law was made, or ſo
much as any order given by the Queen, was
expelled out of the Colledge by the Fellows,
upon their private Authority, who had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to object againſt him, but 1. His fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<hi>Peter Martyr;</hi> 2. His Preaching ſome
Doctrines contrary to Popery; 3. And his
taking Orders according to the Laws then in
force: for as for his Life, it was acknowledged
to be <hi>Angelical and extreamly honeſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

Moren</hi> a Fellow of the ſame Colledge; who
yet at the ſame time could not forbear call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him <hi>Lutheran, Zuinglian,</hi> and <hi>Heretick.</hi> He
took his leave of the Colledge in theſe

            </p>
            <p>IN my laſt Lectures I have (<hi>ſaid he</hi>) imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
the Cuſtom of famiſhed Men, who when
they ſee their meat likely to be ſuddenly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly
ſnatch'd from them, devour it with
the greater haſte and greedineſs. For whereas I
intended thus to put an end to my Lectures, and
perceived that I was like forthwith to be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced,
I made no ſcruple to entertain you (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99001:16"/>
to my former uſage) with much unpleaſant
and ill dreſſed Diſcourſe, for I ſee I have incurred
the diſpleaſure and hatred of ſome, but whether
deſervedly or no, I ſhall leave to their conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for I am perſwaded that thoſe who have
driven me from hence, would not ſuffer me to live
any where if it were in their Power. But as for
me, I willingly yield to the times, and if they can
derive down to themſelves any ſatisfaction from
my Calamity, I would not hinder them from it.
But as <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> when he went into exile and
forſook his Country, pray'd that they might never
more think of him; ſo I beſeech God to grant the
ſame to my Fellow Collegians, and what can they
wiſh for more? Pardon me my Hearers, if grief
has ſeized me, being to be torn from that place
againſt my will, where I have paſſed the firſt part
of my Life, where I have lived pleaſantly, and
been in ſome Honour and Imployment. But why
do I thus delay to put an end to my Miſery by one
word? Wo is me, that (as with my extream ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

               <hi>Thus did he take his leave</hi> (ſaith the Author
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Life before his Works) <hi>of his
Lecture, Fellow-ſhip and Colledge;</hi> and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
at one blow to great Poverty and
Diſſertion: but he found for ſome time a
place of Harbour in <hi>Broadgates-Hall</hi> another
Colledge in the ſame Univerſity. Here he
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99001:17"/>
met with ſome ſhort Gleams of Comfort;
for the Univerſity of <hi>Oxon</hi> more kind than
his Colledge, and to alleviate the Miſeries of
his Shipwrack'd Eſtate, choſe him to be her
<hi>Orator,</hi> in which capacity he curiouſly penned
a Gratulatory Letter or <hi>Addreſs</hi> (as the term
now is) to the Queen, on the behalf and in
the name of the Univerſity, <hi>Expreſſing in it
the Countenance of the</hi> Roman <hi>Senators in the
beginning of</hi> Tiberius <hi>his Reign, exquiſitely tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
and compoſed, to keep out joy and ſadneſs,
which both ſtrove at the ſame time to diſplay
their colours in it; the one for dead</hi> Auguſtus;
<hi>the other for Reigning</hi> Tiberius. <hi>And upon the
Aſſurance of ſeveral of her Nobles, that the
Queen would not change the eſtabliſhed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
expreſſing ſome hopes ſhe would ſo do, which
was confirmed then to them by the Promiſe the
Queen had made to the</hi> Suffolk <hi>and</hi> Norfolk
<hi>Gentry, who had reſcued her out of the very
Jaws of Ruine. Fuller</hi> ſaith, that the Writing
this Letter was put upon him with a deſign
to ruine him, but there is not the leaſt colour
for this ſurmize; he being ſo very lately,
ſeaſonably and kindly choſen <hi>Orator.</hi> when
he was ſo injuriouſly expelled out of his own
Colledge; but it is much more probable the
ſweetneſs, ſmoothneſs and briskneſs of his
ſtile, was both the reaſon why he was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
<hi>Orator</hi> firſt, and then imployed to pen
this Letter. The Sum or Heads of which
are in Mr. <hi>Laurence Humfrey's Life of</hi>
Jewel: <hi>But there is no entire Copy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:99001:17"/>
IT is obſerved by the laſt mentioned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
that whilſt <hi>Jewel</hi> was roading this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to Dr. <hi>Treſham Vice-chancellor,</hi> the great
Bell of <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> (which this Doctor
having cauſed to be new run a few days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
had chriſtened by the name of <hi>Mary,</hi>
toll'd) and that hearing her pleaſant
voice now call him to his beloved <hi>Maſs,</hi> he
burſt out into an Exclamation. <hi>O delicate
and ſweet Harmony! O beautiful</hi> Mary, <hi>how
Muſically ſhe ſounds, how ſtrangely ſhe pleaſeth
my Ears!</hi> So Mr. <hi>Jewel</hi>'s ſweet Pen was
forced to give way to the more acceptable
tinkling of this new Lady. And we may
eaſily conjecture how the poor man took
it.</p>
            <p>BEING thus ejected out of all he had,
he became obnoxious to the Inſolence and
Pride of all his Enemies, which he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to allay by Humility and Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
which yet could not mitigate their
Rage and Fury; but rather in all probability
heightened their Malice, and drew more
Affronts upon the meek man. But amongſt
all his Enemies, none ſought his ruine more
eagerly than Dr. <hi>Martial Dean</hi> of <hi>Chriſt-Church,</hi>
who had changed his Religion
now twice already; and did afterwards twice
or thrice more in the Reign of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth:</hi>
He having neither Conſcience nor
Religion of his own, was wondrous deſirous
to make <hi>Jewel</hi>'s Conſcience or Life a papal
Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:99001:18"/>
IN order to this,<note place="margin">Anno 1553.</note> he ſends to <hi>Jewel</hi> by
the Inquiſitors a bed-roll of Popiſh Doctrines
to be ſubſcribed by him upon pain of Fire
and Faggot, and other grievous Tortures;
the poor man having neither Friend nor
time allowed him to conſult with, took the
Pen in his hand, and ſaying, <hi>Have you a mind
to ſee how well I can write?</hi> Subſcribed his
Name haſtily, and with great reluctance.</p>
            <p>But this no way mitigated the Rage of his
Enemies againſt him, they knew his great
love to, and familiarity with <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi>
and nothing leſs than his Life would ſatisfie
theſe Blood-hounds, of which Turn-coat
<hi>Martial</hi> was the fierceſt: ſo being forſaken
by his Friends for this his ſinful Complyance,
and ſtill purſued like a wounded <hi>Deer</hi> by his
Enemies; but more exagitated by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Remorſes and Reproaches of his own
Conſcience, he reſolved at laſt to flee for his
Life.</p>
            <p>And it was but time; for if he had ſtaid
but one night longer, or gone the right way
to <hi>London,</hi> he had periſhed by their Fury:
One <hi>Auguſtin Berner</hi> a <hi>Switzer,</hi> firſt a Servant
to Biſhop <hi>Latimer,</hi> and afterwards a Miniſter
found him lying upon the ground almoſt dead
with vexation, wearineſs (for this lame Man
was forced to make his eſcape on foot) and
cold, and ſetting him upon an Horſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
him to the Lady <hi>Ann Warcupps</hi> a Widow,
who entertained him for ſome time, and then
ſent him up to <hi>London,</hi> where he was in more
ſafety.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:99001:18"/>
HAVING twice or thrice changed his
Lodgings in <hi>London,</hi> Sir <hi>Nicholas Throgmorton</hi>
a great Miniſter of State in thoſe times, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
him with Money for his Journey, and
procured him a Ship for his Tranſportation
beyond the Seas. And well it had been if
he had gone ſooner; but his Friend Mr. <hi>Park<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurſt</hi>
hearing of the reſtoring of the Maſs
fled forthwith; and poor Mr. <hi>Jewel</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing of it, went to <hi>Cleave</hi> to beg his
advice and aſſiſtance, being almoſt killed by
his long Journey on foot in bitter cold and
ſnowy weather, and being forced at laſt to
return to <hi>Oxon,</hi> more dejected and confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his thoughts than he went out; which
Miſeries were the occaſions of his fall, as
Gods Mercy was the procurer both of his
eſcape and recovery.</p>
            <p>FOR being once arrived at <hi>Franckford</hi> in
the beginning of the ſecond year of Queen
<hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign,<note place="margin">1554.</note> he found there Mr. <hi>Richard
Chambers</hi> his old Benefactor, Dr. <hi>Robert Horne</hi>
afterwards Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> Dr. <hi>Sands</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Knowles a Privy
Counſellor,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Lord Treaſurer,</hi> and
his eldeſt Son, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe received <hi>Jewel</hi> with
the more kindneſs, becauſe he came unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly
and unhoped for, and adviſed him
to make a publick Recantation of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription;
which he willingly did in the
Pulpit the next <hi>Lords-day</hi> in theſe words. <hi>It
was my abject and cowardly mind, and ſaint
heart that made my weak hand to commit this
wickedneſs.</hi> Which when he had uttered as
well as he could for tears and ſighs, he applied
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99001:19"/>
himſelf in a ſervent Prayer, firſt to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
for his Pardon, and afterwards to
the Church; the whole Auditory accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying
him with Tears and Sighes, and ever
after eſteeming him more for his ingenuous
Repentance, than they would (perhaps) have
done if he had not fallen.</p>
            <p>IT is an eaſie thing for thoſe that were
never tried, to cenſure the frailty of thoſe
that have truckled for ſome time under the
ſhock of a mighty Temptation; but let ſuch
remember St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s advice, <hi>Let him that ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
take heed leaſt he fall.</hi> This great Mans
fall ſhall ever be my Leſſon, and if this gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering
<hi>Jewel</hi> were thus clowded and foil'd,
<hi>God be merciful to me a Sinner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr.</hi> JEWEL <hi>had not been long at</hi> Franck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,
<hi>before</hi> Peter Martyr <hi>hearing of it, often
ſollicited him to come to</hi> Strasburgh,<note place="margin">Peter Martyr.</note> 
               <hi>where

all things conſidered, a wonder it is that he
did not periſh in</hi> England;<note place="margin">Eccleſia Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaurata, <hi>p.</hi> 196</note> For there was no
Perſon more openly aimed at than he, becauſe none
of them had given wider Wounds than he to the
Catholick Cauſe. One <hi>Treſham</hi> a Senior Canon
of <hi>Chriſt-Church,</hi> who had held ſome Points
againſt him at his firſt coming thither, now took
the benefit of the times to be revenged on him,
and incited thoſe of <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> and of other
Houſes to affront him publickly. So that not
finding any ſafety at <hi>Oxford,</hi> he retired to <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
to <hi>Cranmer,</hi> where he was ſure of as much
as the place could afford him. A Conſultation
had been held by ſome of the more fiery Spirits,
for his commitment unto Priſon. But he came
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99001:19"/>
thither (as was well known) on the publick
Faith, which was not to be violated for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction

the truth is, the Queen (who was a bigotted

not only her promiſe to the men of</hi> Suffolk,
<hi>who had ſtood</hi> by her in her greateſt neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

yet ſhe was reſolved not to compel or ſtrain others,
otherwiſe than as God ſhould put into their Hearts,
a perſwaſion of that truth ſhe was in; and this
ſhe hoped ſhould be done by the opening his word
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99001:20"/>
to them, by Godly, vertuous, and learned Preachers:
<hi>I ſay, conſidering how ill ſhe kept her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to her own Subjects, it is a wonder ſhe
ſhould keep the Faith given to this Stranger
in her Brothers Reign, and not by her; and
I conceive no reaſon can be given for this,
but the over-ruling Providence of God, who
governs the hearts of Princes as he thinks
fit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT well it was for Mr. <hi>Jewel</hi> that there
he was, and as much of Mr. <hi>Jewel</hi>'s Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in <hi>England</hi> had been occaſion'd by his great
reſpects he had ſhewn to <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> whileſt
he lived at <hi>Oxon:</hi> So now <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> never
left ſolliciting him (as I ſaid) to come to
him to <hi>Strasbourgh</hi> till he prevailed, where
he took him to his own Table and kept him
always with him. And here Mr. <hi>Jewel</hi> was
very ſerviceable to him in his Edition of his
Commentaries upon the Book of <hi>Judges,</hi>
which were all tranſcribed for the Preſs by
him; and he uſed alſo to read every day

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99001:21"/>
indeed any poſſibility of it, I ſuppoſe that
whilſt he was thus with <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> at <hi>Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
he made a ſtep over the <hi>Alpes</hi> to <hi>Padua,</hi>

            <p>DURING all the time of his exile, which
was about four years, he ſtudied very hard,

followed <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Goodman</hi> to <hi>Geneva</hi> their
<hi>Mother City</hi> (as Dr. <hi>Heylyn</hi> ſtiles it) where
they made choice of <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Goodman</hi> for
their conſtant Preachers; under which Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
they rejected the whole Frame and
Fabrick of the Reformation made in <hi>England</hi>

eſpecially about ſuch ſmall matters; leaſt
thereby they ſhould greatly offend the minds of all
good men: which thing (he ſaid) they ought to
have a principal care of.</hi> And doubtleſs this
good man thought that their gratitude to
God for reſtoring them to their Native
Country under the auſpicious Reign of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> of Bleſſed Memory, had for ever
put an end to this diſpute, and he ſeems to

broke looſe again, and juſt about the time of

            </p>
            <p>BUT to return to Mr. <hi>Jewel</hi> and our
Exiles; the ſeventeenth of <hi>November</hi> 1558.
God remembred the diſtreſſed State of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> and put an end to her
Sufferings, by removing that Bigotted Lady:
the news of which flying ſpeedily to our
Exiles, they haſted into <hi>England</hi> again, to
congratulate the Succeſſion of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
of ever Bleſſed Memory.</p>
            <p>HIS good Benefactor and Tutor Mr. <hi>Park<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurſt,</hi>
upon the arrival of this news, made
him a viſit in <hi>Germany;</hi> but fearing Mr. <hi>Jewel</hi>
had not choſen the ſafeſt way for his return
to <hi>England,</hi> left him and went another way,
which ſeeming more ſafe, in the end proved
otherwiſe. Mr. <hi>Jewel</hi> arriving ſafely in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
with what he had, whilſt the other
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99001:22"/>
was robbed by the way; and ſo at his land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in <hi>England,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jewel</hi> (who was here
before him) very gratefully relieved his great
Benefactor.</p>
            <p>THE time of Mr. <hi>Jewel</hi>'s arrival in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>

but he being then at <hi>Zurick</hi> in all probability,
was for that cauſe none of the firſt that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned;
ſo that when he came back, he had
the comfort to find all things well diſpoſed,
for the reception of the Reformation: for the
<hi>Queen</hi> had by a <hi>Proclamation</hi> of the thirtieth of
<hi>December</hi> 1558. ordered that <hi>no man, of what
quality ſoever he were, ſhould preſume to alter any
thing in the State of Religion, or innovate in any
of the Rites and Ceremonies thereunto belonging,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>until ſome further order ſhould be taken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
Only it was permitted, and with all required,
that the Litany, the Lords-Prayer, the Creed and
the Ten Commandments, ſhould be ſaid in the</hi>
Engliſh <hi>Tongue, and that the Epiſtle and Goſpel
ſhould be read in</hi> Engliſh <hi>at the time of the High
Maſs, which was done</hi> (ſaith Dr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>) <hi>in
all the Churches of</hi> London, <hi>on the next Sunday
after being New-Years-day; and by degrees in all
the other Churches of the Kingdom: Further than
this, ſhe thought it not convenient to proceed at
the preſent, only ſhe prohibited the Elevation of
the Sacrament at the Altar of the Chappel Royal:
Which was likewiſe forborn in all other Churches:
and ſhe ſet at liberty all that had been impriſoned
for Religion in her Siſters time, and ordered the
Liturgy to be reviſed with great care, and that a
Parliament ſhould be ſummoned to ſit at</hi> Weſt-minſter
<hi>the</hi> 25th <hi>of</hi> January 1559.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:99001:23"/>
ALL this I ſuppoſe at leaſt was done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Mr. <hi>Jewel</hi> returned into <hi>England;</hi> for
whether he was here at the Coronation is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain.
He was entertained firſt by Mr. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas
Culverwell</hi> for almoſt ſix months, and
then falling into a Sickneſs, was invited, by
Dr. <hi>William Thames,</hi> to lodge at his Houſe;
but this was after the Parliament.</p>
            <p>THE Liturgy being then reviewed, and
whatever might give the Popiſh Party any
unneceſſary Exaſperation or Diſcontent
purged out, in order to the facilitating the
paſſing an Act of Parliament for the ſettling
it, and the eſtabliſhment of other things that
were neceſſary, a publick Diſputation was
appointed on the Thirtieth of <hi>March</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to be holden in the Church of <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>
in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tonguo, in the preſence of
as many of the Lords of the Council, and of
the Members of both Houſes, as were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
to inform themſelves in the State of the
Queſtions. The Diſputation was alſo to be
managed (for the better avoiding of Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion)
by a mutual interchange of Writings
upon every Point; each Writing to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
the next day, and ſo from day to day
till the whole were ended. To all which the
Biſhops at firſt conſented, tho they would not
afterwards ſtand to it. The Queſtions were
Three, concerning Prayers in the Vulgar
Tongue, the Power of the Church, for the
changing Rites and Ceremonies, and the
Propitiatory Sacrifice of the Maſs for the
Living and the Dead.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:99001:23"/>
THE firſt uſe that was made of Mr. <hi>Jewel</hi>
after his return, was the nominating him one
of the Diſputants for the reformed Party; and
tho he was the laſt in number and place, yet
he was not the leaſt either in deſert or eſteem,
having made great Additions to his former
Learning in his four years Exile and Travel:
which is a great improvement to ingenious
Spirits. But this Diſputation was broken off
by the Popiſh Party, who would not ſtand
to the order appointed; ſo that Mr. <hi>Jewel</hi>
in all probability had no occaſion to ſhew
either his Zeal or Learning.</p>
            <p>THE Parliament ended the eighth of
<hi>May</hi> 1559. and by virtue of an Act paſſed
in this Parliament, ſoon after <hi>Midſummer</hi> the
Queen made a Viſitation of all the Dioceſſes
in <hi>England,</hi> by Commiſſioners <hi>for rectifying
all ſuch things as they found amiſs, and could not
be redreſſed by any ordinary Epiſcopal Power, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſpending of more time than the Exigencies of
the Church could then admit of.</hi> And this was
done by a Book of Articles printed for that
purpoſe, and the Inquiry was made upon
Oath by the Commiſſioners. Here Mr. <hi>Jewel</hi>
was taken in again, and made one of theſe
Commiſſioners for the Weſt. When he vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited
his own Native Country, which till
then perhaps he had not ſeen ſince his return
from Exile, when alſo he preached to and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
with his Country-men, and indeavoured
more to win them to imbrace the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by good Uſage, Civility and Reaſon,
than to terrifie or awe them by that great
Authority the Queen had armed him and his
fellow Commiſſioners with.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:99001:24"/>
RETURNING back to <hi>London,</hi> and
giving the <hi>Queen</hi> a good and ſatisfactory ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their Viſitation, the 21ſt of <hi>January</hi>
following, Mr. <hi>Jewel</hi> who was then only
Batchelor of Divinity, was conſecrated Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Sarisbury,</hi> which he at firſt modeſtly
declined, but at laſt accepted, in obedience
to the <hi>Queens</hi> command. This See had been
void by the death of <hi>John Capon</hi> his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Predeceſſor, who died in the year 1557.
now near three years. And here the Divine
Providence again gave him the advantage in
point of Seniority over his Tutor Mr. <hi>John
Parkhurſt,</hi> who was not conſecrated Biſhop
of <hi>Norwich</hi> till the Fourteenth of <hi>July</hi> after;
but then his Tutor had the advantage of him
in point of Revenue, for Mr. <hi>Jewel</hi>'s Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
had been miſerably impoveriſhed by his
Predeceſſor; ſo that he complained after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
that <hi>there was never a good Living left
him that would maintain a Learned Man; for</hi>
(ſaid he) <hi>the</hi> Capon <hi>had devoured all: becauſe
he hath either given away or ſold all the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical
Dignities and Livings.</hi> So that the good
Biſhop was forced all his Life-time after to
take extraordinary pains in travelling and
preaching in all parts of his Dioceſs, which
brought him to his Grave the ſooner: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
his Tutor had a much richer Biſhoprick,
and conſequently more eaſe, and out-lived
his Pupil <hi>Jewel</hi> three years.</p>
            <p>THE Sunday before <hi>Eaſter</hi> of this year,<note place="margin">March 30.</note>
Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> preached at <hi>Paul</hi>'s Croſs, his
famous Sermon upon the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 25.
<hi>For I have received of the Lord that which alſo I
delivered unto you, that-the Lord Jeſus the ſame
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99001:24"/>
night in which he was betrayed took Bread,</hi> &amp;c.
This Sermon gave a fatal blow to the Popiſh
Religion here in <hi>England,</hi> which was become
very odious to all men, by reaſon of the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Cruelty uſed by thoſe of that Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> but the
<hi>Challenge</hi> which he then made, and afterwards
ſeveral times and in ſeveral places repeated,
was the moſt ſtinging part of this Sermon,
and therefore tho I am concerned to be as
ſhort as I can, I will yet inſert this Famous
Piece at large.</p>
            <p>IF any Learned Man of our Adverſaries,<note place="margin">Heylyn's Eccl. Reſtaurata. <hi>p.</hi> 301.</note>
(<hi>ſaid he</hi>) or all the Learned Men that be alive,
be able to bring any one ſufficient Sentence out of
any old Catholick Doctor, or Father, or General
Council, or Holy Scripture, or any one Example
in the Primitive Church, whereby it may clearly
and plainly be proved during the firſt ſix hundred
years. 1. That there was at any time any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Maſſes in the World. 2. Or that there was
then any Communion miniſtred unto the People
under one kind. 3. Or that the People had their
Common-Prayer in a ſtrange Tongue that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
underſtood not. 4. Or that the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome</hi> was then called an univerſal Biſhop, or
the Head of the univerſal Church. 5. Or that
the People were then taught to believe that Chriſt's
Body is really, ſubſtantially, corporally, carnally
or naturally in the Sacrament. 6. Or that his
Body is or may be in a thouſand places or more
at one time. 7. Or that the Prieſt did then hold
up the Sacrament over his Head. 8. Or that the
People did then fall down and worſhip it with
Godly Honour. 9. Or that the Sacrament was
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99001:25"/>
then, or now ought to be, hanged up under a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopy.
10. Or that in the Sacrament after the
words of Conſecration, there remained only the
accidents and ſhews without the ſubſtance of
Bread and Wine. 11. Or, that then the Prieſts
divided the Sacrament into three parts, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
received himſelf alone. 12. Or that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
had ſaid the Sacrament is a Figure, a
Pledge, a Token, or a remembrance of Chriſt's
Body, had therefore been adjudged for an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.
13. <hi>Or</hi> that it was lawful then to have thirty,
twenty, fifteen, ten or five Maſſes ſaid, in the
ſame Church in one day. 14. Or that Images
were then ſet up in the Churches, to the intent the
People might worſhip them. 15. Or that the
Lay-People were then forbidden to read the word
of God in their own Tongue. 16. Or that it was
then Lawful for the Prieſt to pronounce the words
of Conſecration cloſely, or in private to himſelf.
17. Or that the Prieſt had then Authority to
offer up Chriſt unto his Father. 18. Or to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
and receive the Sacrament for another,
as they do. 19. Or to apply the vertue of Chriſts
Death and Paſſion to any Man by the means of the
Maſs. 20. Or that it was then thought a ſound
Doctrine to teach the People that Maſs, <hi>Ex opere
operato</hi> (that is, even for that it is ſaid and
done) is able to remove any part of our ſin.
21. Or that any Chriſtian man called the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lord, his God. 22. Or that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were then taught to believe, that the Body of
Chriſt remaineth in the Sacrament, as long as the
accidents of Bread and Wine remain there with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Corruption. 23. Or that a Mouſe or any other
Worm or Beaſt, may eat the Body of Chriſt, (for
ſo ſome of our Adverſaries have ſaid and taught.)
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99001:25"/>
24. Or that when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Hoc eſt Corpus
meum,</hi> the word <hi>Hoc</hi> pointed not to the Bread,
but to an <hi>individuum vagum,</hi> as ſome of them
ſay. 25. Or that the Accidents, or Forms, or
ſhews of Bread and Wine be the Sacraments of
Chriſts Body and Blood, and not rather the very
Bread and Wine it ſelf. 26. Or that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is a ſign or token of the Body of Chriſt, that
lieth hidden underneath it. 27. Or that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
is the Mother and cauſe of true Devotion.
The Concluſion is, that I ſhall then be content to
yield and ſubſcribe.</p>
            <p>This challenge (ſaith the Learned Dr. <hi>Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyn</hi>)

            <p>WHEN Queen <hi>Mary</hi> died, <hi>Paul</hi> the Fourth
was Pope, to whom Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſent an
account of her coming to the Crown, which
was delivered by Sir <hi>Edward Karn</hi> her Siſters
Reſident at <hi>Rome;</hi> to which the angry Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman

Clement <hi>the Seventh, and</hi> Paul <hi>the

aſſume the Crown without his Conſent; for which
in reaſon ſhe deſerved no favour at his hands;
yet if ſhe would renounce her Pretenſions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
her ſelf wholly to him, he would ſhew a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
affection to her, and do every thing for her
that could conſiſt with the dignity of the Apoſtolick
See.</hi> Which anſwer being haſtily and paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
made, was as little regarded by the
<hi>Queen.</hi> But he dying ſoon after, <hi>Pius</hi> the
Fourth an abler man ſucceeded; and he was
for gaining the <hi>Queen</hi> by Arts and Kindneſs;
to which end he ſent <hi>Vincent Parapalia</hi> Abbot
of St. <hi>Saviours</hi> with courteous Letters to her,
dated <hi>May</hi> the fifth 1560. with order to make
large proffers to her under hand; but the
Queen had rejected the Popes Authority by
Act of Parliament, and would have nothing
to do with <hi>Parapalia,</hi> nor would ſhe ſuffer
him to come into <hi>England.</hi> In the interim the
Pope had reſolved to renew the Council at
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99001:27"/>
               <hi>Trent,</hi> and in the next year ſent Abbot
<hi>Martiningo</hi> his Nuncio to the Queen, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
her and her Biſhops to the Council, and
he accordingly came to <hi>Bruxells,</hi> and from
thence ſent over for leave to come into <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland:</hi>
but tho <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> interceded
for his Admiſſion, yet the Queen ſtood firm,
and at the ſame time rejected a motion from
the Emperor <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> to return to the old
Religion as he called it. Yet after all theſe
denials given to ſo many and ſuch potent
Princes, one <hi>Scipio</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Venice,</hi>
who formerly had had ſome acquaintance
with Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> when he was a Student in
<hi>Padua,</hi> and had heard of <hi>Martiningo's</hi> ill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
in this Negotiation, would needs ſpend
ſome Eloquence in labouring to obtain that
Point by his private Letters, which the
Nuncio could not gain as a publick Miniſter;
and to that end he writes his Letters of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulation
to Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> his old Friend,
preferred not long before to the See of <hi>Saris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi>
Which Letter did not long remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwered;

as if they had been written at the

not.</p>
            <p>THIS Apology being publiſhed during
the very time of the laſt meeting of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Trent,</hi> was read there, and ſeriouſly
conſidered, and great threats made that it
ſhould be anſwered; and accordingly two
Learned Biſhops, one a <hi>Spaniard</hi> and the other
an <hi>Italian,</hi> undertook that task, but neither of
them did any thing in it.</p>
            <p>BUT in the mean time the Book ſpread
into all the Countries in <hi>Europe,</hi> and was
much applauded in <hi>France, Flanders, Germany,
Spain, Poland, Hungary, Denmark, Sweden</hi> and
<hi>Scotland;</hi> and found at leaſt a paſſage into
<hi>Italy, Naples</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf; and was ſoon
after tranſlated into the <hi>German, Italian, French,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99001:28"/>
Spaniſh, Dutch, and laſt into the Greek Tongue;</hi>
in ſo great eſteem this Book was abroad:
and at home it was tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh</hi>

of the Twelve Articles of the Chriſtian Faith
(or Creed) the ſecond is a ſhort and ſolid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation

            <p>THE good Biſhop was moſt encouraged
to publiſh this Apology by <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> (as<note place="margin">Heylyn. <hi>p.</hi> 328.</note>
appears by <hi>Martyr</hi>'s Letter of the 24<hi>th</hi> of
<hi>Auguſt</hi>) with whom he had ſpent the greateſt

lived to ſee the Book which he ſo much longed
for, dying at <hi>Zurick,</hi> on the twelfth day of
<hi>November</hi> following,<note place="margin">1562. In the LXIII. of his Age.</note> after he had paid his
thanks for, and expreſſed his value of this
piece in a Letter which is ſubjoyned to this
Book in all the following Prints. And Mr.
<hi>Camden</hi> alſo in his Annals expreſly ſaith, this
Apology was printed firſt in the year 1562.</p>
            <p>In the year 1564.<note place="margin">1564.</note> Mr. <hi>Harding</hi> put out a
pretended Anſwer to Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi>'s famous
Challenge at <hi>Paul</hi>'s Croſs, mentioned above,
to which in the year following the Biſhop
made a very learned <hi>Reply,</hi> the Epiſtle before
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99001:28"/>
which bears date at <hi>London</hi> the 27<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
of that year: the Biſhop is ſaid to have
ſpent two years in that Piece. The ſame
year the Univerſity of <hi>Oxon</hi> gave him (tho
abſent) the degree of Doctor of Divinity;
and certainly he well deſerved to have that
extraordinary reſpect and Honour ſhewn
him, who was ſo eminently imployed then
in the Service and defence of the Church.</p>
            <p>HE had no ſooner brought this to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,<note place="margin">1567.</note>
but <hi>Harding</hi> was again upon him, and
put out an <hi>Antapology,</hi> or anſwer to his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
for the Church of</hi> England. A <hi>Defence</hi> of
which the Biſhop forthwith began, which he
finiſhed, as appears by his Epiſtle to Mr. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>
at the end of it, the 27<hi>th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> 1567.</p>
            <p>THE next year after Mr. <hi>Harding</hi> put out
another piece, which he entitled, <hi>A detection
of ſundry foul Errors,</hi> &amp;c. which was a cavilling
reply to ſome paſſages in his defence of the
Apology, which not ſeeming to deſerve an
anſwer by it ſelf; he anſwered rather by a
Preface to a new Impreſſion of his former
Defence, which he finiſhed the eleventh of
<hi>December</hi> 1569. and dedicated his Works to
the Queen; <hi>Harding</hi> having told the World
that ſhe was offended with Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> for
thus troubling the World.<note place="margin">1569</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE ſame year Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth
having publiſhed a Bull of Excommunication
and Deprivation againſt the Queen, Biſhop
<hi>Jewel</hi> undertook the defence of his Soveraign,<note place="margin">1570.</note>
and wrote a learned Examination and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation
of that Bull; which was publiſhed
by <hi>John Garbrand</hi> an intimate acquaintance
of his, together with a ſhort Treatiſe of the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99001:29"/>
Holy Scriptures, both which, as he informs
us, were delivered by the Biſhop in his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral
Church in the year 1570.<note place="margin">1570.</note>
            </p>
            <p>BESIDES theſe he writ ſeveral other
large pieces; as 1. a Paraphraſtical Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Epiſtles and Goſpels through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole year. 2ly. Diverſe Treatiſes
of the Sacraments and Exhortations to the
Readers. 3ly. Expoſitions of the Lords
Prayer, the Creed and Ten Commandments.
And alſo 4ly. An Expoſition upon the Epiſtle
to the <hi>Galatians;</hi> the firſt of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and
both the Epiſtles to the <hi>Theſſalonians;</hi> which
I ſuppoſe were his Sermons: for he was of
opinion that it was a better way of teaching,<note place="margin">Humfrey's, <hi>p.</hi> 111.</note>
to go through with a Book, than to take
here and there a Text; and that it gave the
People a more clear and laſting know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>IN the beginning of the next year was a
Parliament,<note place="margin">April 5. 1571.</note> and conſequently a Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when <hi>Tho. Cartwright</hi> and others of that
Faction, having alarmed the Church by their
Oppoſitions to the eſtabliſhed Religion, it
was thought fit to obviate their bold attempts,
and thereupon command was given by the
Arch-biſhop, <hi>That all ſuch of the lower Houſe
of Convocation, who had not formerly ſubſcribed
unto the Articles of Religion agreed upon</hi> Anno
1562. <hi>ſhould ſubſcribe them now; or on their
abſolute refuſal, or delay, be expelled the Houſe:</hi>
Which occaſioned a general and perſonal
Subſcription of thoſe Articles. And it was
alſo farther ordered, <hi>That the Book of Articles
ſo approved, ſhould be put into Print, by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
of the Right Reverand Doctor</hi> John
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99001:29"/>
Jewel <hi>then Biſhop of</hi> Sarum; which ſhews he
was there, and in great eſteem.</p>
            <p>IT was in ſome part of this year alſo,
that he had his Conference, and preached
his laſt Sermon at <hi>Paul</hi>'s Croſs about the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
and State of the Church, which he
mentioned on his Death-bed. But I cannot
fix the preciſe time of either of them, or give
any further account with whom that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
was. But however this Holy man
ſought nothing but the Peace and Welfare of
the Church, by theſe gentle and mild ways
of Correption: the Diſſenters of thoſe times
treated him for it with as little reſpect as
Mr. <hi>Harding</hi> and his Confraternity had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as Biſhop <hi>Whitgift</hi> aſſures us; his words
are theſe. <hi>They</hi> (the Diſſenters) <hi>will not ſtick</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>in commending themſelves, to deface
all others, yea even that notable</hi> JEWEL,
<hi>whoſe both Labour and Learning they do envy;</hi>
and amongſt themſelves deprave, as I have
heard with mine own ears, and a number
more beſides. For further proof whereof, I
do refer you to the report, that by this facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was ſpread of him after his laſt Sermon
at <hi>Paul</hi>'s Croſs, becauſe he did confirm the
Doctrine before preached by a famous and
learned man touching obedience to the Prince
and Laws. <hi>It was ſtrange</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to me, to
hear ſo notable a Biſhop, ſo learned a Man, ſo
ſtout a Champion of true Religion, ſo painful a
Prelate, ſo ungratefully and ſpitefully uſed by a ſort
of wavering, wicked and wretched Tongues:
but it is their manner, be you never ſo welll
learned, never ſo painful, ſo zeal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

all is nothing with them, but they will
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99001:30"/>
deprave you, rail on you, back-bite you, invent
lyes of you, and ſpread falſe rumours, as though
you were the vileſt Perſons in the whole earth.</hi>

            <p>THUS writes that venerable Arch-biſhop
in his <hi>Defence of the Anſwer to the Admonition,</hi>
p. 423. upon occaſion of a Paper written alſo
about this time by Biſhop <hi>Jewel, upon certain
frivolous Objections againſt the Government of the
Church of</hi> England, <hi>made by</hi> Thomas Cart
wright; which the Biſhop had confuted, and
<hi>Cartwright</hi> writing againſt him, <hi>Whitgift</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
them in this place; and by the by
ſhews how ill the good Biſhop was treated for
his laſt Sermon at <hi>Paul</hi>'s Croſs, by this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Vipers; which extorted from him
that Proteſtation he made on his Death-bed,
of which I ſhall give an account hereafter.</p>
            <p>BEING naturally of a ſpare and thin
Body, and thus reſtleſly traſhing it out with
reading, writing, preaching and travelling,
he haſtened his death, which happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was full fifty years of Age; of which
he had a ſtrange Perception a conſiderable
time before it happened, and wrote of it to
ſeveral of his Friends, but would by no means
be perſwaded to abate any thing of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
exceſſive Labours, ſaying, <hi>A Biſhop ſhould
die preaching.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THO he ever governed his Dioceſs with
great diligence, yet perceiving his death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching,
he began a new and more ſevere
Viſitation of it; correcting the Vices of the
Clergy and Laity more ſharply; injoyning
them in ſome places tasks of Holy Tracts to
be learned by heart, conferring Orders more
carefully, and preaching oftener.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:99001:30"/>
HAVING promiſed to preach at <hi>Lacock</hi>
in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> a Gentleman who met him go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thither, obſerving him to be very ill by
his looks, adviſed him to return home, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him it was better the People ſhould want
one Sermon, than to be altogether deprived
of ſuch a Preacher. But he would not be
perſwaded, but went thither and preached
his laſt Sermon out of the fifth to the <hi>Galat.
Walk in the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. which he did not finiſh
without great labour and difficulty.</p>
            <p>THE Saturday following being the 22d.
of <hi>September</hi> 1571. he piouſly and devoutly
rendered up his Soul into the Hands of God,
having firſt made a very devout and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Exhortation to thoſe that were about him,
and expreſſing much diſlike of one of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
who prayed for his Recovery. He died
at <hi>Monketon farly,</hi> when he had been a Biſhop
almoſt twelve years; and was buried almoſt
in the middle of the Quire of his Cathedral
Church, and <hi>Aegidius Lawrence</hi> preached his
Funeral Sermon. He was extreamly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed
by all men; and a great number of
<hi>Latin, Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> Verſes were made
on this occaſion by learned men, which are
collected and printed by Mr. <hi>Lawrence Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi>
Regius Profeſſor of Divinity at <hi>Oxon,</hi> in
the end of his Life written in <hi>Latin</hi> by the
order of that Univerſity; nor has his name
been ſince mentioned by any Man, without
ſuch Elogies and Commendations as befitted
ſo great, ſo good, ſo learned and laborious a
Prelate.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus brought him to his Grave,
my Reader may be pleaſed to permit me to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:99001:31"/>
collect ſome particular things which could
not ſo well be inſerted into the Hiſtory of his
Life, without breaking the thread of it.</p>
            <p>HE had naturally a very ſtrong Memory,<note place="margin">Memory.</note>
which he had ſtrangely improved by Art.
Mr. <hi>Humfrey</hi> gives ſeveral Examples of this,
but I will inſtance in two only, <hi>John Hooper</hi>
Biſop of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> who was burnt in the
Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> once to try him, writ
about forty <hi>Welſn</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> words; Mr. <hi>Jewel</hi>
going a little while aſide, and recollecting
them in his Memory, and reading them twice
or thrice over, ſaid them by heart backward
and forward exactly in the ſame order they
were ſet down. And another time he did the
ſame by ten Lines of <hi>Eraſmus</hi> his Paraphraſe
in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the words of which being read
ſometimes confuſedly without order, and at
other times in order by the Lord Keeper <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Jewel</hi> thinking a while on them,
preſently repeated them again backward and
forward, in their right order and in the wrong,
juſt as they were read to him; and he taught
his Tutor Mr. <hi>Parkhurſt</hi> the ſame Art.</p>
            <p>THO his Memory were ſo great and ſo
improved,<note place="margin">Induſtry.</note> yet he would not intirely rely
upon it,<note place="margin">Common place Books.</note> but entered down into Common
place Books, whatever he thought he might
afterwards have occaſion to uſe; which, as
the Author of his Life informs us, were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in number, and great in quantity, being
a vaſt Treaſure of Learning, and a rich Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitory
of Knowledge, into which he had
collected Sacred, Profanne, Poetick, Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick
and Divine Notes of all ſorts; and all
theſe he had again reduced into a ſmall piece
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:99001:31"/>
or two, which were a kind of General In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dexes,
which he made uſe of at all times
when he was to ſpeak or write any thing;
which were drawn up in Characters for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
and thereby ſo obſcured, that they
were not of any uſe, after his Death, to any
other perſon. And beſides theſe, he ever
kept Diaries,<note place="margin">Diaries.</note> in which he entered whatever
he heard or ſaw that was remarkable; which
once a year he peruſed, and out of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
what ever was more remarkable.</p>
            <p>AND from hence it came to paſs, that
wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>eas Mr. <hi>Harding</hi> in that great Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie
they had, abounded only in Words,
Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> overwhelm'd him with a cloud
of Witneſſes and Citations out of the ancient
Fathers, Councils, and Church Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
confirming every thing with ſo great a
number of inconteſtableo Authorities, that
Mr. <hi>Harding</hi> durſt never after pretend to a
ſecond perfect and full Anſwer, but content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himſelf with ſnarling at ſome ſmall pieces:
the truth is, as Dr. <hi>Heylyn</hi> obſerves, all the
following Controverſies were in this point
beholding to the indefatigable Induſtry of
this great <hi>Leader.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>YET he was ſo careful in the uſe of his
own Common place Books, that when he
was to write his Defence of the <hi>Apology,</hi> and
his <hi>Reply,</hi> he would not truſt intirely to his
own Excerpts or Tranſcriptions, but having
firſt carefully read Mr. <hi>Hardings</hi> Books, and
marked what he thought deſerved an Anſwer,
he in the next place drew up the Heads of his
intended Anſwer, and reſolved what Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
he would make uſe of upon each Head,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:99001:32"/>
and then by the Directions of his Common
place Book, read and marked all thoſe Paſſages
he had occaſion to make uſe of, and delivered
them to ſome Scholars to be tranſcribed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their proper Heads, that he might have
them together under his Eye, when he came
to write; which Care and Diligence of his
ſpeaks at once both his Induſtry, Fidelity,
and Modeſty, in that he would not truſt his
own Tranſcripts, and is a juſt reprehenſion
of the Falſhood of thoſe who knowingly
make falſe Citations, and of the ſupine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>

               </gap>uſt
from other men, and uſe them without any
Examination; by which means great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes
are made, and Cotroverſies ſpring up
to the Diſturbance of the World. The truth
is, a man ought to re-examine his own
Thoughts, for what may ſeem very perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
at a firſt reading to any purpoſe, may
prove otherwiſe upon ſecond thoughts, and
a cloſe Obſervation of what goes before, or
follows after in the Author; and few men
are ſo exact in their firſt Excerpts, but thro
Haſ, Inadvertence or Miſtake, they may
more or leſs err and be deceived; not to ſay
that a mans Intention of Mind is much exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the fixing it upon one particular Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and the expectation of a Conviction
from his Adverſary, in caſe he make the
leaſt Miſtake. This Account of our venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Biſhop was given by one Mr. <hi>John
Garbrand,</hi> who was intimately acquainted
with him, in an Epiſtle Dedicatory before
ſome of his Sermons, printed in Octavo, in
the year 1583.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:99001:32"/>
HE was an excellent <hi>Grecian,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Languages.</note> and not
unacquainted with the <hi>Italian</hi> Tongue, and
as to the <hi>Latin,</hi> he wrote and ſpoke it with
that elegance, politeneſs, purity and fluency,
that it might very well be taken for his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<hi>Peter Martyr</hi> and the other learned men at

who was his Bedfellow almoſt all the time

extreamly civil and obliging to all; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

the Life of an Angel; and tho he were lame,
yet till his being a Biſhop, he travailed for the

with a Contribution from his Uncle Mr. <hi>John

and a Companion he had with him, dine at

boaſted of with much joy and gratitude, when
he ſaw his Mother and Friends, whither he
was then travelling a Foot. The Biſhop when
he parted with him, gave him good Counſel
and his Bleſſing, but forgot to give him Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
which when the Biſhop bethought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

again, and then told him, <hi>I ſent for you</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,
<hi>to lend you a Horſe which hath carried

And preſently delivered into his hand a walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-ſtaff,

            <p>BUT to return to Biſhop <hi>Jewel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 2. §. 6.</note> he had
collected an excellent Library of Books of all
ſorts, not excepting the moſt impertinent of
the Popiſh Authors; and here it was that he
ſpent the greateſt and the beſt part of his time,
rarely appearing abroad, eſpecially in a Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
till eight of the Clock; ſo that till that
time it was not eaſie to ſpeak with him; when
commonly he eat ſome ſlight thing for the
ſupport of his thin Body; and then, if no
Buſineſs diverted him, retired to his Study
again till <hi>Dinner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HE maintained a plentiful, but ſober Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and tho at it he eat very little himſelf,
yet he took care his Gueſts might be well
ſupplied, entertaining them in the mean
time with much pleaſant and uſeful Diſcourſe,
telling and hearing any kind of innocent and
divertſiing Stories: for tho he was a man of a
great and exact, both Piety and Virtue, yet
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99001:37"/>
he was not of a moroſe, ſullen, unſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable
Temper, and this his Hoſpitality was
equally beſtowed upon both Foreigners and
Engliſh men.</p>
            <p>AFTER Dinner he heard Cauſes, if any
came in; and diſpatched any Buſineſs that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to him (tho he would ſometimes do
it at Dinner too;) and anſwered any Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and very often arbitrated and compoſed
Differences betwixt his People, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his great Wiſdom and Integrity, did very
often refer themſelves to him as the ſole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrator,
where they met with ſpeedy, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial,
and unchargeable Juſtice.</p>
            <p>AT nine at night he call'd all his Servants
about him, examin'd how they had ſpent
their time that day, commended ſome, and
reproved others, as occaſion ſerved, and then
cloſed the day with Prayers, as he began it:
the time of his publick Morning Prayers
ſeems to have been eight.</p>
            <p>AFTER this, he commonly went to his
Study again, and from thence to Bed, his
Gentlemen reading ſome part of an Author
to him, to compoſe his Mind, and then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
himſelf to his God and Saviour, he
betook himſelf to his Reſt.</p>
            <p>HE was extream careful of the Revenues
of the Church, not caring whom he offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to preſerve it from impoveriſhing in an
Age, when the greateſt men finding the
Queen not over liberal to her Courtiers and
Servants, too often paid themſelves out of
the Church Patrimony, for the Services
they had done the Crown, till they ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd
ſome Biſhopricks intirely, and left others
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99001:38"/>
ſo very poor, that they are ſcarce able to
maintain a Prelate.</p>
            <p>THERE is one inſtance of this mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by all that have written our Biſhops Life;
a Courtier (who was a Lay-man) having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a Probendary in the Church of <hi>Saris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
and intending to lett it to another Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſon
for his beſt Advantage, acquainted
Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> with the Conditions between
them; and ſome Lawyers opinion about
them. To which the Biſhop replied; <hi>What
your Lawyers may anſwer I know not; but for my
part, to my Power, I will take care that my
Church ſhall ſuſtain no loſs whilſt I live.</hi> What
was the event of this, none of them have told us.</p>
            <p>NOR was he careful of his own Church
only, but of the whole <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by his Sermon upon <hi>Pſalm</hi> 69. v. 9. <hi>The
Zeal of thine Houſe hath eaten me up.</hi> Which
he preached before the Queen and Court, as
appears by it in ſeveral Addreſſes to her in the
body of that Sermon. In it he hath this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.
<hi>In other Countries the receiving of
the Goſpel hath always been the cauſe that Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was more ſet by; and Learning hath ever been
the furtherance of the Goſpel. In</hi> England, <hi>I know
not how it cometh otherwiſe to paſs, for ſince the
Goſpel hath been received, the maintenance for
Learning hath been decayed; and the lack of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
will be the decay of the Goſpel.</hi> And a little
after he tells us, <hi>Thoſe that ſhould be foſters of
Learning, and increaſe the Livings, had no Zeal.
What ſaid I, increaſe? Nay the Livings and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
which heretofore were given to this uſe, are</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>taken away.</hi> And a little after,
<hi>Whereas all other Labourers and Artificers have
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99001:38"/>
their hire encreaſed double, as much as it was
wont to be; only the poor man that laboureth and
ſweateth in the Vineyard of the Lord of Hoſts, hath
his hire abridged and abated.</hi> And he applies
himſelf towards the Concluſion thus to the
great men. <hi>You inriched them which mocked and
blinded and devoured you; ſpoil not them now that
feed and inſtruct and comfort you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had not taken the pains to tranſcribe ſo
much of this excellent Diſcourſe, which may
eaſily enough be read by any that deſire it in
his Works, but to raiſe a little conſideration if
it be poſſible, in this debauched Age. This good
man foretold here, that this Sacrilegious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtation
of the Church would in time be the
ruine of the Goſpel, as he calls the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ſo it came to paſs: for whereas he
obſerved then, that <hi>by reaſon of the Impropriati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the Vicarages in many places, and in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſt
Market Towns were ſo ſimple, that no man
could live upon them, and therefore no Man would
take them, but the People were forced to provide
themſelves as they might with their own Money;</hi>
the Conſequence of this in a few years
was, that theſe mercenary men becoming
Factious, or being ſuch, crept into ſuch places
out of hopes of the greater advantage; and
ſo infected the minds of the Trades-men, that
as the Church became very much weakened
and diſquieted by their Factions; ſo our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
in a little while became ſtuft with a
ſort of Lay-Brethren who were Enemies both
to the Church and Crown, which was a great
part of the occaſion of the Rebellion in 1640.
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:99001:39"/>

upon the Reſtitution of his late Majeſty
<hi>Charles</hi> the Second, for the prevention of ſuch
Miſchiefs for the future, yet no care was
taken of theſe Livings in Market Towns and
Corporations; by which means it came to
paſs, that within about twenty years more,
we were very fairly diſpoſed for another
change, and nothing but God prevented it.
From whence I conclude, that till this leak is
ſtopped, both Church and Crown will be in
danger of a Shipwrack.</p>

            <head>A Letter written to the Reverend Father
in God Dr. John Jewel Lord Biſhop of
Sarisbury, by Dr. Peter Martyr.</head>
            <p>BY the favour of the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> (moſt
worthy Prelate and my very good Lord) there
was brought me one of your <hi>Apologies for the
Church of</hi> England; which neither I nor any
others hereabouts before had ſeen: It is true in
your laſt Letter you rather intimated that it might
come out, than ſignfied that it ſhould; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it came not hither till about the middle of
<hi>July.</hi> And from hence your Lordſhip may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
how much we ſuffer from the diſtance of
places. It hath not only given me an intire ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
who approve and am ſtrangely pleaſed
with all you do; but to <hi>Bullinger</hi> and his Sons, and
Sons in Law: And it ſeems ſo very wiſe, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
and elegant to <hi>Gualter</hi> and <hi>Wolphius,</hi>
that they can put no end to their Commendations
of it, as not thinking there hath been any thing
printed in theſe times of ſo great a Perfection. I
do infinitely congratulate this great felicity of your
Parts, this excellent Edification of the Church,
and the Honour you have done your Country, and
I do moſt earneſtly beſeech you to go on in the ſame
way; for tho we have a good Cauſe, yet the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders
of it are few in compariſon of its Enemies;
and they now ſeem ſo awakened, that they have
of late won much upon the ignorant Multitude,
by the goodneſs of their Stile, and the ſubtilty of
their Sophiſtry. I ſpeak this of <hi>Staphylus</hi> and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:99001:40"/>
               <hi>Hoſius,</hi> and ſome other Writers of that Party,
who are now the ſtout Champions of the Papal
Errors. But now you have by this your moſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
and learned <hi>Apology,</hi> raiſed ſuch an hope
in the minds of all good and learned men, that
they generally promiſe themſelves, that whilſt you
live, the reformed Religion ſhall never want an
Advocate againſt its Enemies. And truly I am
extreamly glad, that I am ſo happy as to live to
ſee that day which made you the Father of ſo illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
and eloquent a Production. May the God
of Heaven of his goodneſs grant that you may be
bleſſed in time with many more ſuch.</p>

            <head>THE
APOLOGY
OF THE
Church of ENGLAND.

               <head type="sub">Of the true Religion profeſſed in the Church

               <p>IT is an old Complaint deriv'd down<note place="margin">Truth ever perſecuted.</note>
to us from the very times of the
Patriarchs and Prophets, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
by the Evidence of all Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories,
and the Teſtimonies of all Ages, that
<hi>Truth</hi> is a Stranger upon Earth,<note place="margin">Tertul. in Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logia.</note> and doth
too eaſily find Enemies and Defamers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99001:42"/>
ſhe is not known: and although this
may ſeem perhaps incredible to thoſe who
have not attentively reflected on it, becauſe
Mankind, by the inſtinct of Nature, without
any Teacher, doth ſpontaneouſly breathe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Truth;</hi> and Chriſt himſelf our Saviour,
whilſt he convers'd with Men, choſe to be
call'd the TRUTH, as if that Name did
aptly expreſs all the Power and Force of his
Divine Nature: yet we who are acquainted
with the Holy Scriptures, and have read and
conſidered what hath happenned to pious
men in almoſt all Ages, what befel the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
the Apoſtles, the holy Martyrs, and
Chriſt himſelf; with what Slanders, Curſes,
and Injuries they were vexed whilſt they liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
only for the ſake of <hi>Truth.</hi> We (<hi>I ſay</hi>)
ſee by this, that it is no new thing, but uſual,
and the Cuſtom of all Ages. Indeed it would
appear much more wonderful and incredible,
if the Father of Lyes, the Devil, that Enemy
of all Truth, ſhould now of a ſudden change
his Mind, and entertain any other hopes of
oppreſſing the Truth than by Lyes; or
ſhould now begin to eſtabliſh his Kingdom
by other Arts than thoſe he hath hitherto
imployed: For in all Ages we ſhall ſcarce find
any Period of time in which Religion en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed,
eſtabliſhed it ſelf, or was reform'd,
but that at the ſame time Truth and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
were moſt unworthily and moſt inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
treated by men; for the Devil knows
very well, that if <hi>Truth</hi> doth flouriſh in ſafety,
his Affairs can neither be ſafe nor proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>

2. FOR to ſpeak nothing of the Ancient
Patriarchs and Prophets, no part of whoſe
Lives (as I ſaid) was free from Reproaches and
Slanders. We know that of Old there were
ſome who averr'd and publickly told the
World,<note place="margin">Cor. Tacitus. Tertul. in Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log. c. 7. c. Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</note> that the Ancient <hi>Jews,</hi> who we doubt
not worſhipped the only true God, perform'd
their Religious Rites to a Swine or an Aſs,
and that all that Religion was a meer Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and a Contempt of all Deities. We
know that the Son of God our Saviour Jeſus
Chriſt,<note place="margin">John 8. 9. 10. Mar. 11.</note> whileſt he taught the truth, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
an Impoſtor, an Inchanter, a <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi>
a <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> a Deluder of the people; a
Wine-bibber and a Glutton. Who knows not
what was ſaid of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that powerful
Preacher and Aſſertor of <hi>Truth,</hi> ſometimes
he was a ſeditious man, and liſted Soldiers,
and deſigned a Rebellion; and at other times,
that he was an Heretick, a mad man; that
out of a contentious and perverſe Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he was a Blaſphemer againſt the Law of
God, and a Deſpiſer of the Cuſtoms of the
Fathers? Who knows not that ſo ſoon as
ever St. <hi>Stephen</hi> had admitted the Truth, and
ſuffered it to take Poſſeſſion of his Soul, and
thereupon (as he ought) began freely and
ſtoutly to preach and own it, he was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
call'd in queſtion for his Life, as one
that had ſpoken Blaſphemy againſt the Law,
againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> againſt the Temple and God?<note place="margin">Marcion, ex Tertullian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or knows not that the Holy Scriptures have
been accuſed of Vanity and Folly, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
that they contain'd things contrary and
repugnant one to another, and that all the
Apoſtles of Jeſus Chriſt diſagreed amongſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99001:43"/>
themſelves, and that St. <hi>Paul</hi> differed from
all the reſt? And that I may not trouble you
with all the Inſtances of this nature which
are upon Record (for they are infinite) who
knows not what Slanders were of old raiſed
againſt our Forefathers,<note place="margin">Tertul Apolog. c. 2, 3. and 7. 8, 9.</note> who firſt imbraced
and profeſſed the Name of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> that they
conſpired amongſt themſelves againſt the
Government, and for that purpoſe, met ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
early, whilſt it was yet dark; that they
murthered Male-Infants, gorged themſelves
with Mans Fleſh, and in a barbarous manner
drank humane Blood; and at laſt, putting
out the Candles, perpetrated Inceſts and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteries;
and that Brothers lay with their
Siſters, and Sons with their Mothers, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any reverence to their Bloods and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
without Difference or Modeſty; that
they were impious, deſtitute of all Religion,
Atheiſts, the Enemies of all Mankind, and
unworthy of the Light or Life.</p>
               <p>3. THESE things were ſpoken againſt
the <hi>Jews,</hi> the People of God, againſt Chriſt
Jeſus, againſt St. <hi>Paul,</hi> St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> and
againſt all thoſe who in the firſt Ages
imbraced the truth of the Goſpel, and were

<hi>Many.</hi> And although none of theſe things
were true, yet the <hi>Devil</hi> thought it ſufficient
to his Purpoſe if they were believed true;
that ſo the Chriſtians might incur the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Hatred, and be purſued by all to Ruine
and Deſtruction. And thus Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
being deceived, ſlew all the Prophets of
God to a Man, they condem'd <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to the
Saw, <hi>Jeremia</hi> to be ſton'd, <hi>Daniel</hi> to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

                  <hi>Amos</hi> to the Iron Bar, <hi>Paul</hi> to the
Sword, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the Croſs, and all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
to Priſons,<note place="margin">Sueton, in Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone. Juvenal. Sat.</note> to Racks, to Croſſes, to
Rocks and Precipices, to wild Beaſts and
Fires, and burnt whole Piles of their living
Bodies for nocturnal Lights, and by way of
Sport and Recreation; and never eſteem'd
them better than the moſt vile Filth of the
Earth, the Off-ſcourings and Scorn of the
World; thus the firſt Authors and Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
of the Truth, were ever treated.</p>
               <p>4. WHEREFORE all we who have
now undertaken the Profeſſion of the Goſpel
of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ought to bear it with the leſs
diſturbance of Mind, if in the ſame Cauſe,
we are treated after the ſame manner; and
as heretofore our Fathers,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.</note> ſo we in this Age,
are perſecuted alſo with Reproaches, Slanders
and Lyes, only becauſe we teach and profeſs
the Truth.</p>
               <p>5. THEY roar out in all Places,<note place="margin">The Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the R. Catholicks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> that
we are Hereticks, that we have forſaken the
true Faith, and broken the Union of the
Church with new Opinions and impious
Doctrines. 2. <hi>That</hi> we fetch from Hell, and
revive the old and long ſince condemn'd <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies,</hi>
and ſow the Seeds of new Sects, and
unheard of Broils: that we are already di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into contrary Factions and Opinions,
and we could never yet in any manner agree
amongſt our ſelves. 3. <hi>That</hi> we are wicked
men, and like the Gyants of old, have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
into a Rebellion againſt God himſelf,
and live without the leaſt regard to the Deity,
and without any religious Worſhip. 4. <hi>That</hi> we
deſpiſe all good Actions; that we do not uſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99001:44"/>
any virtuous Diſcipline, that we regard nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Laws nor good Manners, nor Right, nor
Juſtice, nor Equity, nor Order; that we let
looſe the Rein, and ſuffer all ſorts of Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and even provoke the People to all the
Licentiouſneſs and Luxury that is poſſible.
5. <hi>That</hi> our Buſineſs and great Deſign is the
ſubverting Monarchies and Kingdoms, that
all States may be reduced under the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the ignorant Multitude, and the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
Populace. 6. <hi>That</hi> we have made a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous
Defection from the Catholick
Church, and have ſhaken the Peace of the
World, and diſturbed the Quiet of the Church
by a deteſtable Schiſm; and that as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> roſe up againſt <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
and <hi>Aaron,</hi> ſo we, without any juſt cauſe
have revolted from the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> 7. <hi>That</hi>
we deſpiſe the Authority of the Primitive
Fathers and antient Councils: <hi>That</hi> we have
imprudently and inſolently abrogated the
antient <hi>Ceremonies</hi> which have been approved
for many Ages by our Fathers and Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers,
who had better Manners, and lived
in better Times; and that by our own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Authority, without the Conſent of a
Holy and General Council, we have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
new Rites into the Church; and that
we have not done this for the Sake of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but purely out of a contentious Humour;
that they on the contrary have changed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but have retained all things as they
were delivered to them by the Apoſtles; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by the moſt antient Fathers, and have
been kept ever ſince, through all the interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Ages to this day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:99001:44"/>
6. AND leaſt all this might ſeem to be
only a Calumny, and that managed by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Whiſpers only, with deſign to excite an
Envy againſt us, the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned
eloquent and not unlearned Men to
undertake the Defence of this deſperate
Cauſe, and to repreſent it to the World in
Books and long Diſcourſes, in the beſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
it was poſſible to give it, to the intent,
that being elegantly and copiouſly pleaded,
unskilful men might ſuſpect there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than ordinary in it; for indeed
they ſaw that their Cauſe was every where
in a declining Condition; their Arts were
now ſeen through, and ſo were the leſs
eſteemed; their Fortreſſes were every day
undermin'd, and their Caſe ſtood in need of
a powerful Patronage and Defence. But then
as to thoſe things which they have charged
us with, ſome of them are manifeſtly falſe,
and condemn'd by the Conſciences of them
that object them againſt us; others, though
in the bottom they are falſe too, yet they
have the ſhew and ſimilitude of truth, ſo that
an incautious and unthinking Reader may
(eſpecially if he be ſurpriſed by any of their
laboured and elegant Diſcourſes) be eaſily
circumvented and deceived: and others of
the things thus charged upon us, are ſuch as
we ought to acknowledge and profeſs, and
not decline the owning them, as if they were
Crimes, but defend them, as things that
were well and rationally done. For to ſpeak
in a word, they ſlander whatever we do, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
thoſe Actions of ours, which themſelves
cannot deny to be rightly and well done;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99001:45"/>
and malitiouſly deprave and pervert all our
Words and Actions, as if it were not poſſible
<hi>We</hi> ſhould do or ſpeak any thing as we ought.
They ought indeed to treat us with more
Simplicity and Candor, if they deſigned
truth; but on the other hand, they do not
oppoſe us with truth, nor in a Chriſtan
Way or Manner, but with Lyes, in a cloſe
and crafty way; and abuſe the blindneſs and
ignorance of the Rabble, and the want of
Learning in Princes, to the inflaming their
Hatred againſt us and the Oppreſſion of the
Truth. This is indeed the <hi>Power of Darkneſs,</hi>
and the Folly of Men, who truſt more in the
Stupidity and benighted Minds of the unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
Multitude, than in the Light of Truth;
or as St. <hi>Jerom</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>This is to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
with ſhut Eyes, the Truth, when it is moſt
perſpicuous.</hi> But we bleſs the great and Holy
God, our Cauſe is ſuch, that though they
never ſo much deſire to defame it, yet they
can fix no Reproach upon it, which they
may not with as much Reaſon and Juſtice
imploy againſt the Holy Fathers, the
Prophets, the Apoſtles, againſt St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and even againſt Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>7. BUT now if they are ſo ambitious of
the Honour of being thought polite and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Slanderers, it does ſo much the leſs
befit us to be mute and careleſs in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of our moſt excellent Cauſe; for it
is certainly the part only of diſſolute Men,
who can ſecurely and wickedly ſhut their
Eyes when the Divine Majeſty is injured,
to be wholly unconcern'd; what is (tho'
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99001:45"/>
falſly and unjuſtly) ſaid of them and their
Cauſe, eſpecially when it is of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that the Glory of God, and the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of Religion are at the ſame time
violated; for although other, and thoſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
very great Injuries, may be born and
diſſembl'd by a modeſt Chriſtian, <hi>yet He</hi>
(ſaith <hi>Ruffinus) who ſhall patiently put up
the Name of an Heretick, does not deſerve
to be called a Chriſtian.</hi> Permit us then
to do that which all Laws, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Voice of Nature commands us, that
which Chriſt himſelf did, when he was in a
like Caſe aſſaulted with Reproaches; that
is, ſuffer us to repel their Defamations, and
with Modeſty and Truth, to defend our
Cauſe and Innocence: for Chriſt himſelf,
when the Phariſees charged him with Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
as if he had entered a Combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with impure Spirits, and by their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
wrought many Wonders,<note place="margin">John 8. 49.</note> replied, <hi>I
have not a Devil, but I honour my Father,
and ye do diſhonour me;</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when
he was undervalued by <hi>Feſtus</hi> the <hi>Proconſul,</hi>
as a Mad-man,<note place="margin">Act. 26. 25.</note> anſwered, <hi>I am not mad,
moſt noble</hi> Feſtus, <hi>but ſpeak forth the Words
of Truth and Soberneſs.</hi> And the Primitive
Chriſtians, when they were traduced to the
People as Murtherers, Adulterers, Inceſtuous
Perſons, and Diſturbers of the Government,
and ſaw that the Excellence of their
Religion might be call'd in queſtion, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if they held their Peace, and by their
Silence, ſeemed to confeſs the truth of
theſe Accuſations, and ſo the Courſe of
the Goſpel might be hindered, they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon

                     <p>
                        <hi>Tertullian</hi> wrote a very learned and a ſharp Apology for the Chriſtian Religion, which was ſome few years ſince made Engliſh. It was firſt publiſhed by the Author, without his Name, in the year of Chriſt 201. in the very City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and did great ſervice to Chriſtianity, which was then moſt miſerably oppreſſed by the Lies and Defamations of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> which did it more hurt than all their other Fury.</p>
                  </note>made publick Orations, wrote ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
Books, and diſcourſed before Emperors
and Princes in the publick defence of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and the Chruch.</p>
               <p>8. BUT we perhaps may ſeem not to
need any Defence, ſo many thouſands of our
Brethren in the laſt twenty years having
born teſtimony to the Truth, amidſt the
moſt exquiſite Tortures; and Princes, in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to put a ſtop to the Progreſs of
the Goſpel, and to that purpoſe uſing ſeveral
Methods, having yet in the end been able to
effect nothing; and the whole World now
beginning to open their Eyes, and to ſee the
Light, and therefore it may ſeem (as I ſaid)
that enough hath been ſpoken, and that our
Caſe is ſufficiently defended, the thing ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for it ſelf; for if the Popes themſelves
would, or indeed, if they could conſider
with themſelves the Beginning and Progreſs of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99001:46"/>
our Religion; how theirs without any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
without any humane Force hath
fallen; and in the interim, ours hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed,
and by degrees been propagated into
all Countries, and hath been entertained in
the Courts of Kings, and the Palaces of
Princes, even whilſt it was oppoſed from the
beginning by Emperors, by Kings, by Popes,
and almoſt by all others; theſe things (I ſay)
are clear Indications that God himſelf ſights
for us, and doth from Heaven deride and ſcorn
their Projects and Endeavours, and that the
Power of <hi>Truth</hi> is ſo great, that no humane
Force, nor the very Gates of Hell ſhall ever
be able to prevail againſt it; for ſo many
free Cities, ſo many Princes cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
mad, as at this day have fallen from
the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and choſen rather to joyn
themſelves to the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>9. FOR although Popes have not as yet at
any time been at leiſure to think attentively
and ſeriouſly of theſe things; or although
other Thoughts may now hinder and diſtract
them, or they may think theſe things light,
and beneath the Dignity of the Popedom;
is our Cauſe therefore to be thought ever the
worſe? or if perhaps they will pretend not
to ſee what indeed they do ſee, and that they
chooſe rather to oppoſe the Truth, even
then when they are convinced of it; are we
therefore preſently to be reputed Hereticks,
becauſe we cannot comply with their Wills?
If Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the IIII. had been ſuch a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
as his Name ſpeaks him, and as he ſo
much deſires to be thought; nay, indeed if
he had but been ſo good a man, as to have
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99001:47"/>
eſteem'd us as his Brethren, or as MEN,
certainly he would diligently have conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
our Reaſons, and what could have been
alledged for and againſt us, and not with ſo
raſh and blindfold a precipitancy have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
without hearing our cauſe, or allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Liberty of a Defence ſo conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a part of the World, ſo many learned,
ſo many Religious men, ſo many Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths,
ſo many Kings, and ſo many Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as he has ſentenced in his Bull, concerning
his late pretended Council.</p>
               <p>10. BUT now, becauſe We are ſo publickly
in this unjuſt manner noted by him, left by
our ſilence we ſhould ſeem to confeſs the
Crimes charged upon us, and the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we could in no manner be heard in any
publick Council; where he would ſuffer none
to have any Suffrage, or propoſe his Judgment,
who was not firſt ſworn to him, and intirely
addicted to his Intereſt (for of this we had too
great an experience in the laſt Council of
<hi>Trent,</hi> when the Ambaſſadors and Divines of
the Princes and free Cities of <hi>Germany</hi> were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
excluded out of the Council; nor can we
forgot that <hi>Julius</hi> the III. above ten years ſince,
took a mighty care by his <hi>Reſcript,</hi> that none
of our Men might be heard in the Council, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it were one that was diſpoſed to recant
and change his Opinion.) For theſe cauſes (I
ſay) we have thought fit by this Book to give
an account of our Faith, and to anſwer truly
and publickly what hath been publickly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
againſt us, that the whole World may
ſee the Parts and Reaſons of that Faith which
ſo many good men have valued above their
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99001:47"/>
Lives, and that all Mankind may underſtand
what kind of men they are, and what they
think of God and Religion, whom the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Rome</hi> has inconſiderately enough, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they had made their Defence, without
Example and without Law condemn'd for
<hi>Hereticks,</hi> upon a bare report, that they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
from him and his in ſome points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>11. AND though St. <hi>Jerome</hi> will allow no
man to be patient under the Suſpicion of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie,</hi>
yet we will not behave our ſelves nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſowerly nor irreverently, nor angerly,
tho' he ought not to be eſteemed either
ſharp or abuſive, who ſpeaks nothing but the
truth; no, we will leave that ſort of Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to our Adverſaries, who think whatſoever
they ſpeak, although it be never ſo ſharp and
reproachful, modeſt and appoſite, when it is
applied to us, and they are as little concern'd
whether it be true or falſe; but we, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
nothing but the Truth, have no need of
ſuch baſe Arts.</p>
               <p>12. NOW if we make it appear, and that
not obſeurely and craftily, but <hi>bona fide,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, truly, ingeniouſly, clearly and
perſpicuouſly, that we teach the moſt holy
Goſpel of God, and that the antient Fathers,
and the whole Primitive Church are on our
ſide, and that we have not without juſt cauſe
left them, and return'd to the Apoſtles and
the antient Catholick Fathers; and if they,
who ſo much deteſt our Doctrine, and pride
themſelves in the name of Catholicks, ſhall
apparently ſee, that all thoſe Pretences of
Antiquity, of which they ſo immoderately
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99001:48"/>
glory, belong not to them, and that there
is more ſtrength in our Cauſe than they
thought there was; then we hope that none
of them will be ſo careleſs of his Salvation,
but he will at ſome time or other bethink
himſelf which ſide he ought to joyn with.
Certainly, if a man be not of an hard and
obdurate Heart, and reſolved not to hear,
he can never repent the having once conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
our Defence, and the attending what is
ſaid by us, and whether it be agreeable or no
to the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p>13. FOR whereas they call us <hi>Hereticks,</hi> that
is ſo dreadful a Crime, that except it be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
ſeen, except it be palpable, and as
it were to be felt with our Hands and Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
it ought not to be eaſily believed that a
Chriſtian is or can be guilty of it; for <hi>Hereſie</hi>
is a Renunciation of our Salvation, a Rejection
of the Grace of God, and a departure from
the Body and Spirit of Chriſt. But this was
ever the Cuſtom and Uſage of them and of
their Fore-fathers, that if any preſumed to
complain of their Errors, and deſired the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of Religion, they condemn'd them
forthwith for Hereticks, as Innovators and
factious men. <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf was call'd a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan,</hi>
for no other cauſe, but for that
they thought he had made a defection to a
new Religion or <hi>Hereſie.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> the
Apoſtle being call'd in queſtion, was accuſed
of Hereſie, to which he replied.<note place="margin">Acts 24. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>After the
Way which they call Hereſie, ſo worſhip I the God
of my Fathers, believing all things which are
written in the Law, and in the Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:99001:48"/>
14. In ſhort, all that Religion which we
Chriſtians now profeſs in the beginning of
Chriſtianity,<note place="margin">Tertul. in Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log.</note> was by the <hi>Pagans</hi> call'd a <hi>Sect</hi>
or <hi>Hereſie;</hi> with theſe words they fill'd the
ears of Princes, that when out of prejudice
they had once poſſeſſed their minds with an
Averſion for us, and that they were perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that whatever we ſaid was Factious and
Heretical, they might be diverted from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
upon the thing it ſelf, or ever hearing
or conſidering the Cauſe: but by how much
the greater and more grievous this Crime is,
ſo much the rather ought it to be proved by
clear and ſtrong Arguments, eſpecially at
this time, becauſe men begin now adays a
little to diſtruſt the Fidelity of their <hi>Oracles,</hi>
and to inquire into their Doctrine with much
greater induſtry than has heretofore been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed;
for the People of God in this Age are
quite of another Diſpoſition than they were
heretofore, when all the <hi>Reſponſes</hi> and Dictates of
the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> were taken for Goſpel, and
all Religion depended upon their Authority;
the Holy Scriptures, and the Writings of the
Apoſtles and Prophets are every where now
to be had, out of which, all the true and
Catholick Doctrine may be proved, and all
Hereſies may be refuted.</p>
               <p>15. BUT ſeeing they can produce nothing
out of the Scriptures againſt us, it is very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
and cruel to call us Hereticks, who
have not revolted from Chriſt, nor from the
Apoſtles, nor from the Prophets. By the
Sword <hi>of Scripture</hi> Chriſt overcame the Devil
when he was Tempted by him; with theſe
<hi>Weapons every high thing that exalteth it ſelf</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 4. 5.</note>

for <hi>all Scripture</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul) is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by inſpiration of God, and is profitable for
Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that the Man of God may be perfect and
throughly furniſhed unto all good Works;</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
the Holy Fathers have never
fought againſt Hereticks with any other
Arms, than what the Scriptures have afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them. St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> when he diſputed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Petilianus a Donatiſt</hi> Heretick,<note place="margin">De Vnitate Eccl. c. 3. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Max. lib. 3. c. 14.</note> uſeth
theſe words, <hi>Let not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>theſe words be
heard, I ſay, or thou ſayeſt, but rather let us ſay,
thus ſaith the Lord, let us ſeek the Church there,
let us judge of our Cauſe by that.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In prim. cap. <hi>Aggei.</hi>
                  </note> And St. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi>
ſaith, <hi>Let whatever is pretended to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
by the Apoſtles, and cannot be proved by
the Teſtimony of the writen Word, be ſtruck with
the Sword of God.</hi> And St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> to the
Emperor <hi>Gratian, Let the Scriptures</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>let the Apoſtles, let the Prophets, let Chriſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogated.</hi>
The Catholick Fathers and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
of thoſe times, did not doubt but our
Religion might be ſufficiently proved by
Scripture; nor durſt they eſteem any man
an Heretick, whoſe Error they could not
perſpicuouſly and clearly prove ſuch by
Scripture. And as to us, we may truly reply
with St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 24. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>After the way which they call
HERESIE, ſo worſhip I the God of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
believing all things which are written in
the Law and the Prophets,</hi> or the Writings of
the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>16. IF therefore we be Hereticks, and they
(as they deſire to be call'd) be Catholicks;
why do they not do what they ſee the Fathers
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99001:49"/>
and all other Catholicks have done? why do
they not convince us out of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?
why do they not try us by them?
why do they not ſhew that we have made a
defection from Chriſt, from the Prophets,
from the Apoſtles, and from the Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?
Why do they ſtand? Why do they
draw back? It is the Cauſe of God. Why
then ſhould they fear to commit it to the
Arbitriment of the Word of God? But if
we are Hereticks, who ſubmit all ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies
to the Holy Scriptures, and appeal to
thoſe very Words which we know were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to writing by God himſelf, and prefer
them before all other things which can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
be excogitated by the Wit of Man;
what are they, or by what Name ſhall they
be call'd, who fear and ſhun the Sentence of
the Scriptures, that is, the Judgment of God
himſelf, and prefer their own Dreams and
ſilly Inventions before them, and have for
ſome Ages violated the Inſtitutions of Chriſt
and his Apoſtles, for the ſake of their Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
There is a Story of <hi>Sophocles</hi> the Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,
that when he was very old, he was
accuſed before the Judges by his own Sons,
for a childiſh and a ſilly Perſon, as one that
had waſted his Eſtate by ill managery, and
ſtood in need of a Guardian in his old Age, to
take care of him and it; the old Man appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Court, and inſtead of a De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ence, reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Tragedy, which he had very elaborately
and elegantly written, juſt in that time the
Suit was depending, and thereupon asked the
Judges if that Poem were the Work of a
childiſh perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:99001:50"/>
16. SO we therefore, becauſe we are taken
by them for mad-men, and are traduced as
if we were Hereticks, and as if we had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to do with Chriſt, nor with the Church
of God; have thought it not unreaſonable or
unprofitable to propound openly and freely
the Faith in which we ſtand, and all that
Hope which we have in Chriſt Jeſus, that all
may ſee what we think of every part of the
Chriſtian Religion, and ſo determine with
themſelves, whether that Faith which they
muſt needs perceive to be conſonant to the
Words of Chriſt and the Writings of the
Apoſtles, and the Teſtimonies of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Fathers, and which is confirmed by the
Examples of many Ages, be only the Rage
of a ſort of mad-men, and a Combination, or
Conſpiracy of Hereticks.</p>

whatever is contain'd within the Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

               <p>2. WE believe that Jeſus Chriſt, the only
Son of the eternal Father, as it had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed,
before the beginning of all things,
when the fulneſs of time came, took our
Fleſh and perfect Humane Nature of that
bleſſed and pure Virgin, that he might reveal
to Men, that hidden and ſecret Will of his
Father, which was conceal'd from all former
Ages and Generations; and that in this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

our Sins, and the <hi>Obligation</hi> which lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us.</p>
               <p>3. FOR we believe that for our ſakes he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
was buried, deſcended into Hell, and the
third day, by a Divine Power, returned to
Life, and aroſe, and after forty days, in the
ſight of his Diſciples, aſcended into Heaven,
that he might fill all things, and that the very
Body in which he was born, in which he
convers'd, in which he was deſpiſed, in
which he had ſuffered moſt grievous Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and a moſt direful Death, in which
he roſe, and now aſcended to the right hand
of his Father; was placed above all Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities

                  <note place="margin">Tract. 30. in Joan.</note>
we believe that tho Chriſt added Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty

Nature of a Body;<note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan.</note> nor is Chriſt to be ſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted

God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. AND from thence we believe Chriſt
ſhall return to exerciſe a general Judgment,
as well upon thoſe he ſhall then find alive, as
upon all that are then dead.</p>
               <p>5. WE believe that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> who is
the third Perſon in the Holy <hi>Trinity,</hi> is true
God, not made nor created, nor begotten,
but proceeding from both, that is, from the
Father and the Son, in a way neither known

them. We believe that it is He who ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
the Hardneſs of Mans Heart, when he
is received into their Hearts, by the ſaving
preaching of the Goſpel, or by any other
way whatſoever; that it is He who inlightens
them, and leads them to the Knowledge of
God, into all the ways of Truth, into a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
newneſs of Life, and a perpetual hope of
Salvation.</p>
               <p>6. WE believe that there is one <hi>Church</hi> of
God, and that not conſin'd as it was hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to the Jewiſh People, in one Angle or
Kingdom, but that it is <hi>Catholick</hi> and <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal,</hi>
and ſo diffuſed or ſpread over the Face
of the whole Earth; that there is no Nation
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99001:51"/>
which can juſtly complain that it is excluded,
and cannot be admitted into the Church and
People of God; that this Church is the
Kingdom, the Body and Spouſe of Chriſt;
that Chriſt is the only Prince of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
that there is in the Church divers Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Miniſters, that there are ſome who
are <hi>Deacons,</hi> others who are <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and
others who are <hi>Biſhops,</hi> to whom the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of the People, and the Care and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of Religion is committed. And yet
that there neither is, nor is it poſſible there
ſhould be, any one man who has the care of
this whole Catholick Church, for Chriſt is
ever preſent with his Church, and needs not
a <hi>Vicar,</hi> or ſole and perfect Succeſſor; and
that no mortal Man can in his mind contain
all the Body of the Univerſal Church, that is,
all the parts of the Earth, much leſs can he
reduce them into an exact Order, and
rightly and prudently adminiſter its Affairs.
That <hi>the Apoſtles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De Simpl. Praelatorum.</note> as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith, <hi>were all
of equal Power and Authority, and that all the
reſt were what</hi> St. Peter <hi>was; that it was ſaid
to all alike,</hi> Feed: <hi>To all,</hi> go ye into all the
World: <hi>To all,</hi> teach ye the Goſpel. And
that as St. <hi>Jerome</hi> ſaith, <hi>All Biſhops, whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they are ſetled, whether it be at</hi> Rome <hi>or</hi>
Eugubium, <hi>at</hi> Conſtantinople <hi>or</hi> Rhegium,
<hi>they are of equal Worth, and of the ſame Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</hi>
And as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith, <hi>there is but one
Epiſcopacy, and each of them hath a perfect and
intire ſhare of it.</hi> And that according to the
Judgment and Sentence of the Council of
<hi>Nice,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> hath no more Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in the Church of God than the other
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99001:52"/>
Patriarchs, <hi>viz.</hi> the Patriarchs of <hi>Alexandria</hi>
and <hi>Antioch.</hi> That the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who
now endeavours to draw all the Eccleſiaſtical
Authority to himſelf alone, if he doth not his
Duty, that is, if he doth not adminiſter the
Sacraments, if he doth not inſtruct the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
Admoniſh and Teach, he is not to be
call'd a Biſhop, or indeed a Presbyter; for
as St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Biſhop</hi> is the Name of a
Work or Office, and not a Title of Honour;
ſo that he who would uſurp an unprofitable
Preheminence in the Church is no Biſhop.
But then, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Perſon ſhould be the Head of the whole
Church, or an univerſal Biſhop is no more
poſſible, than that he ſhould be the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom,
the Light, the Salvation, and the
Life of the Church, for theſe are the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
and Titles of Chriſt alone, and do
properly and only belong to him; nor was
there ever any Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who would
ſuffer ſo inſolent and proud a Title to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him, before the Times of <hi>Phocas</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
who as we very well know, aſpired to
the Empire by a moſt deteſtable Villany (the
Murther of <hi>Mauritius</hi> the former Emperor,
his Soveraign) that is, till the year of Chriſt
613. That the Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                  <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe he now deſires to be
ſo call'd, and uſurps a Power which belongs
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99001:52"/>
not to him, beſides that, he acts directly
againſt the ancient Councils and the Fathers,
if he dares believe St. <hi>Gregory,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gregory</hi> lib. 4. Ep. 76. 78. 80. lib. 7. Ep. 69.</note> one of his own
Predeceſſors, he has taken upon him an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant,
prophane, ſacrilegious, antichriſtian
Title, and is therefore the King of Pride,
<hi>Lucifer,</hi> one that ſets himſelf above his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
who has denied the Faith, and is
thereby become the fore-runner of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</p>
               <p>7. WE ſay that a Miniſter ought to have
a lawful Call, and be duly and orderly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
in the Church of God, and that no
Man ought at his own Will and Pleaſure to
intrude into the ſacred Miniſtry. So that a
very great Injury is done us, by them, who
ſo frequently affirm, that nothing is done de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
and in order with us, but all things are
managed confuſedly and diſorderly; and
that with us all (that will) are Prieſts,
Teachers, and Interpreters.</p>
               <p>8. WE ſay that Chriſt has given to his
Miniſters the Power of Binding and Looſing,
of Opening and Shutting. And we ſay that
the Power of Looſing conſiſts in this, that
the Miniſter, by the preaching of the Goſpel,
offers to dejected Minds and true Penitents,
through the Merits of Chriſt, Abſolution,
and doth aſſure them of a certain Remiſſion of
their Sins, and the hopes of eternal Salvation.
Or ſecondly, reconciles, reſtores, and receives
into the Congregation and Unity of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
thoſe Penitents, who by any grievous Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
or known and publick Offence, have
offended the Minds of their Brethren, and in
a ſort, alienated and ſeparated themſelves
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99001:53"/>
from the common Society of the Church,
and the Body of Chriſt. And we ſay, the
Miniſter doth exerciſe the Power of Binding
or Shutting, when he ſhuteth the Gate of the
Kingdom of Heaven againſt Unbelievers and
obſtinate Perſons, and denounceth to them
the Vengeance of God and eternal Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
or excludeth out of the Boſome of
the Church, thoſe that are publickly excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated;
and that God himſelf doth ſo far
approve whatever Sentence his Miniſters ſhall
ſo give, that whatſoever is either looſed or
bound by their Miniſtry here on Earth, he
will in like manner bind or looſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
in Heaven: The Key with which theſe
Miniſters do ſhut or open the Kingdom of
Heaven, we ſay with St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> is <hi>the
Knowledge of the Scripture;</hi> with <hi>Tertullian,</hi> is
the <hi>Interpretation of the Law;</hi> and with <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi>
is the <hi>Word of God.</hi> We ſay the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Chriſt received this Power (from him)
not that they might hear the private Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of the People, and catch their whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Murmurs, as the Popiſh Prieſts every
where now do; and that in ſuch a manner,
as if all the force and uſe of the Keys conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only in this; but that they might go and
Preach and Publiſh the Goſpel, that ſo they
might be a ſavour of Life unto Life, to them
that did believe; and that they might be
alſo a ſavour of Death unto Death, to thoſe
that did not believe; that the Minds of the
Pious, who were affrighted with the ſenſe of
their former ill Lives and Errors, after they
beheld the Light of the Goſpel, and believed
in Chriſt, might be opened by the Word of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99001:53"/>
God, as doors are with a Key. And that
the wicked and ſtubborn, who would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and return into the Way, might be left,
ſhut up,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 13.</note> and locked, and as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it, might <hi>wax worſe and worſe;</hi> this we
take to be the meaning of the <hi>Keys,</hi> and that
in this manner the Conſciences of Men are
either bound or looſed. We ſay that the
Prieſt is a Judge; but then we ſay with St.
<hi>Ambroſe,</hi> that he hath not the Right of any
Dominion; and therefore Chriſt reprehended
the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> with theſe words,
that he might reprove their Negligence in
teaching:<note place="margin">Math. 23. 13. Luk. 11. 52.</note> 
                  <hi>Wo unto you Scribes and Phariſees,
for you have taken away the Key of Knowledge,
and ſhut up the Kingdom of Heaven againſt Men.</hi>
Seeing then the Key, by which a Paſſage is
opened for us into the Kingdom of Heaven,
is the Word of the Goſpel, and the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Law and the Scriptures: where
there is no ſuch Word, there is no Key.
And ſeeing the ſame word was given to all,
and the Key which pertains to all, is but one;
we ſay that the Power of all Miniſters as to
binding and looſing, is one and the ſame;
and we ſay, that even the Pope himſelf, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
his Flatterers, do ſo ſweetly
ſooth him up with theſe words,<note place="margin">Math. 16. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>I will give
unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi>
as if they belonged to him, and to no other
Mortal under Heaven; except he makes it his
Buſineſs to bend and ſubdue the Conſciences
of Men to the Word of God, we deny that
even he (as I ſaid) can either open or ſhut,
or hath at all the Keys; and altho he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oth teach and inſtruct the People (which I
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99001:54"/>
wiſh he would ſometimes do truly, and at
laſt be perſwaded to believe it is at leaſt ſome
part of his Duty and Office) but yet if he
did ſo, his Key would be neither better nor
greater than that of others; for who made
that difference? Who taught him to open
more learnedly, or abſolve more powerfully
than his Brethren?</p>
               <p>9. WE ſay that Marriage is Honorable
and Holy in all degrees of Men, in Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs,
in Prophets, in Apoſtles, in Holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
in the Miniſters of the Churches, and in

Scriptures, both of the Old and New
Teſtament; and we give our gracious God
moſt hearty Thanks, that he hath ſet up this
Light for us, which we ever fix our Eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
leſt by humane Fraud, or the Snares of the
Devil, we ſhould be ſeduced to Errors or
Fables: We own them to be the heavenly
Voices by which God hath reveal'd and
made known his Will to us; in them only
can the Mind of Man acquieſce; in them all
that is neceſſary for our Salvation is aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
and plainly contain'd, as <hi>Origen,</hi>
St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> and St. <hi>Cyrill</hi> have
taught us. They are the very Might and
Power of God unto Salvation; they are the
Foundations of the Apoſtles and Prophets,
upon which the Church of God is built; they
are the moſt certain and infallible Rule by
which the Church may be reduced, if She
happen to ſtagger, ſlip, or err, by which all
Eccleſiaſtical Doctrines ought to be tried;
no Law, no Tradition, no Cuſtom is to be
received or continued,<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 8.</note> if it be contrary to
Scripture. No, tho St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, or an
Angel from Heaven ſhould come and teach
otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>11. WE receive alſo and allow the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
of the Church, that is, the ſacred Signs
and Ceremonies which Chriſt commanded
us to uſe, that he might by them, repreſent to
our eyes the Myſteries of our Salvation, and
moſt ſtrongly confirm the Faith we have in
his Blood, and ſeal in our Hearts his Grace;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99001:55"/>
and we call them <hi>Figures, Signs, Types, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>types,
Forms, Seals, Prints or Signets, Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
Examples, Images, Remembrances and
Memorials;</hi> with <hi>Tertullian, Origen,</hi> St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi>
St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi>
St. <hi>Baſil</hi> and <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> and many other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Fathers. Nor do we doubt with
them, to call them a kind of <hi>viſible Words;
the Signets of Righteouſneſs, and the Symbols of
Grace;</hi> and clearly affirm, that in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lords Supper, the Body and
Blood of our Lord, is truly exhibited to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers;
that is, the enlivening Fleſh of the
Son of God; the Bread that comes from
above, the Nouriſhment of Immortality,
the Grace, the Truth, and the Life; and
that it is the Communion of the Body and
Blood of Chriſt, by the Participation of
which we are quickned, ſtrengthened, and
fed to immortality, and by which we are
conjoyned, united and incorporated with
Chriſt, that we may remain in him, and he
in us.</p>
               <p>12. WE acknowledge that there are two
Sacraments properly ſo call'd, <hi>Baptiſm, and
the Supper</hi> of the Lord; for ſo many we ſee
were delivered to us, and conſecrated by
Chriſt, and approved by St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin,</hi>
and the ancient Fathers.</p>
               <p>13. AND we ſay that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Remiſſion of Sins, and of that
Waſhing which we have in the Blood of
Chriſt, and that none are to be denied that
Sacrament, who will profeſs the Faith of
Chriſt, no, not the Infants of Chriſtians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are born in ſin, and belong to the
People of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:99001:55"/>
14. WE ſay that the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
or viſible <hi>Symbol</hi> of the Body
and Blood of Chriſt, in which the Death
and Reſurrection of Chriſt, and what he did
in his humane Body, is in a manner repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to our eyes, that we may give him
thanks for his Death, and our Deliverance
by it; and that by frequenting the Sacrament,
we may often renew the Remembrance of it,
and that by the Body and Blood of Chriſt,
we may be nouriſhed into the Hope of the
Reſurrection, and of eternal Life; and that
we may be aſſured that the Body and Blood
of Chriſt hath the ſame effect in the feeding
of our Souls, which the Bread and Wine have
in the repairing the Decays of our Bodies.
To this great and ſolemn Feaſt the People
are to be invited, that they may all commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
together, and may publickly ſignifie
and teſtifie both their Union and Society
amongſt themſelves, and that Hope which
they have in Chriſt Jeſus; and therefore, if
there was any one heretofore, before the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Maſs was introduced, who would be
only a Spectator, and yet would abſtain
from the Holy Communion, the Biſhops of
<hi>Rome</hi> in the Primitive Times, and the ancient

(ſaith he) <hi>the Apoſtles ordained, and the Holy
Church of</hi> Rome <hi>holds.</hi> And we ſay, that both
the Parts of the Sacrament ought to be given
to all that come to the Holy Communion,
for ſo Chriſt commanded, and the Apoſtles
inſtituted throughout the World, and all the
ancient Fathers and Catholick Biſhops ſo
practiſed;<note place="margin">De conſecratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Diſt. 1. cap. comperimus.</note> 
                  <hi>and if any one ſhall do otherwiſe</hi>
(ſaith <hi>Gelaſius) he commits Sacriledge;</hi> and
therefore our Adverſaries, who exploding
and rejecting the Communion, defend the
private Maſs, and a multitude of Sacraments,
without the authority of the Word of God,
without any ancient Council, without any
Catholick Father, without any Example of
the Primitive Church, and without Reaſon,
and this againſt the expreſs Command of
Chriſt, and alſo againſt all Antiquity in ſo
doing, act wickedly and ſacrilegiouſly.</p>
               <p>15. WE ſay that the <hi>Bread and Wine</hi> are
the Holy and Heavenly Myſteries of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and Blood of Chriſt, and that in them,
Chriſt himſelf, the true Bread of eternal
Life is ſo exhibited to us as preſent, that we
do by Faith truly take his Body and Blood,
and yet at the ſame time we ſpeak not this ſo
as if we thought the Nature of the Bread and
Wine were totally changed and aboliſhed, as
many in the laſt Ages have dreamt, and as
yet, could never agree amongſt themſelves
about this Dream. For neither did Chriſt
ever deſign that the Wheaten Bread ſhould
change its Nature, and aſſume a new kind of
Divinity, but rather that it might change us;

own proper Nature (for they remain in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Subſtance and Figure and Species.</hi> Or then
what St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>that which you ſee, is
Bread, and a Cup, as your Eyes inform you; but
that which your Faith deſires to be inſtructed in, is
this, the Bread is the Body of Chriſt, and the Cup
is his Blood.</hi> Or then that of<note n="e" place="margin">In Math. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Origen, that
Bread which is conſecrated by the Word of God, as
to the Matter of it, goes into the Belly, and is caſt
out by the Draught.</hi> Or then that of Chriſt
himſelf, who ſaid, not only after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration,
but after the finiſhing of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: Luke 22. 18.
<hi>I will drink no more of the Fruit of the
Vine;</hi> for it is certain the Fruit of the Vine is
Wine, and not Blood? And yet when we
ſpeak thus, we do not ſo depreſs the Eſteem
of the Supper of the Lord, as to teach that it
is a meer cold Ceremony, and that nothing
is done in it, which many falſly report of us;
for we aſſert that Chriſt in his Sacraments
doth exhibit himſelf truly preſent: In Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
that we may put him on: In his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
that we may eat him by Faith, and in
the Spirit, and that by his Croſs and Blood
we may have Life Eternal; and this we
ſay is not ſlightly and coldly, but really and
truly done; for although we do not touch
Chriſt with our Teeth and Lips, yet we hold
and preſs him by Faith, Mind, and Spirit.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99001:57"/>
Nor is that Faith vain which imbraceth
Chriſt, nor that Participation cold, which is
perceived by the Mind, Underſtanding and
Spirit; for ſo Chriſt himſelf is intirely offered
and given to us in theſe Myſteries as much as
is poſſible, that we may truly know that we
are Fleſh of his Fleſh,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 23. John 6. 56.</note> and Bone of his
Bone, and that he dwells in us, and we in
him.</p>
               <p>16. AND therefore in the Celebration
of theſe Myſteries, before we come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Holy Communion, the People are
fitly admoniſhed to <hi>lift up their Hearts,</hi> and
that they ſhould direct their Minds to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
for there he is, by whom we are to be
fed and live. And St. <hi>Cyrill</hi> ſaith, <hi>that in
partaking of the Holy Myſteries, all groſs Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
are to be excluded.</hi> And the <hi>Nicen</hi>
Council, as it is cited by ſome in Greek, doth
expreſly forbid us <hi>to think only on the Bread
and Wine that are ſet before us.</hi> And St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi>
Writes well, <hi>We ſay that the Body of
Chriſt is the Carcaſs, and we are to be the Eagles,
that thereby we may learn to mount aloft, if we
will approach the Body of Chriſt; for this is the
Table of Eagles, and not of Jayes.</hi> And St.
<hi>Cyprian,</hi>

                  <hi>This Bread is the Meat of the Soul,

reach my Hand into the Heavens, and touch him
who ſits there? Send thy Faith thither</hi> (ſaith he)

that which was commendable in them, is it

that which was once true, is it now, becauſe

               <p>4. AND yet (as I ſaid) this curſed Crop
has not ſprung up in our Fields, where the

their Riſe in the darkneſs and blindneſs of our

Truth is oppreſſed with Tyranny and Cruelty,
nor are theſe things to be heard of any where

confute theſe Hereſies, which we are falſly
reported to nouriſh and encourage, whilſt
our adverſaries ſit ſtill and mind nothing
leſs.</p>
               <p>5. AND whereas they ſay we are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into divers Sects, and that ſome of us
have taken the Names of <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of<note n="*" place="margin">Thoſe who were call'd <hi>Zuinglians</hi> when this Piece was written, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards were call'd <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> and the other Name is now not commonly known, but <hi>Zuinglius</hi> was the Author of the Doctrine, and <hi>Calvin</hi> of the Diſcipline of this Sect of turbulent men.</note> 
                  <hi>Zuinglians</hi> (or <hi>Calviniſts</hi>) and we
could never yet agree amongſt our ſelves
concerning the Articles of our Doctrines.
What would they have ſaid if they had lived
in the Times of the Apoſtles and Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?
When one ſaid I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> another,
I am of <hi>Cephas,</hi> and another, I am of <hi>Apollo;</hi>
when St. <hi>Paul</hi> reprehended St. <hi>Peter;</hi> when
by reaſon of a Quarrel, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi>
ſeparated one from the other, and went ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
ways; when as <hi>Origen</hi> acquaints us, the
Chriſtians were divided into ſo many Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that they had no Name common to
them, but that of <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and they agreed
in nothing elſe but that Nane; and as <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
informs us, they were derided publickly in
the Theaters by the People, for their Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Sects; and when, as <hi>Conſtantine the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:99001:62"/>
Great</hi> ſaid, <hi>there was ſo many Contentions and
Controverſies in the Church, that this very ſingle
Calamity ſeem'd to exceed the Miſeries of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times</hi> (of Perſecution;) when <hi>Theophilus,
Epiphanius, Chryſoſtom, Auguſtin, Ruffinus,</hi> and
St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> all of them Chriſtians, all Fathers,
and all Catholicks, conteſted each others
with moſt violent and implacable Animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
when, as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> ſaith, <hi>the Members
of the ſame Body conſumed one another;</hi> when the
Eaſtern and Weſtern Churches contended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Leavened Bread, and the time of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Eaſter, things of no mighty conſequence;
when in every Council (which were then nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous)
there was a new Creed, and new
and contrary Decrees minted. What would
theſe men have then ſaid? to whom would
they have applied themſelves? from whom
would they have fled? in what Goſpel would
they have believed? whom would they
have eſteemed Catholicks, and whom
Hereticks? Now there are only two Names,
<hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> and what a Noiſe is
made about them! But becauſe theſe two
could not agree about ſome Points; ſhall we
therefore think they are both in the wrong,
that neither of them has the Goſpel, and
that neither has preached well and truly?</p>
               <p>6. BUT O good God! who are they
that ſo bitterly reflect on us for our Diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
Do they in the mean time all agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
themſelves? Have there never been
any Diſſenſions and Controverſies amongſt
them? Why then do the <hi>Scotiſts</hi> and <hi>Thomiſts</hi>
agree no better concerning the Merit of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity,</hi>

Original Sin in the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and about a

affirm, that Auricular Confeſſion is founded

ſay, that the Body of Chriſt is <hi>naturally</hi>

by others; that then there are ſome who
ſay, that the Body of Chriſt in the Sacrament
is torn and ground with our Teeth; and again,

Chriſt did conſecrate by a cortain Divine

ſome that he did it by conceiving the five

                  <hi>there be ſome who ſay Dogs and Mice may truly

any more? It is a long and troubleſome Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to count up all their Diviſions; the
whole Form of this Religion and Doctrine,
is to this day controverted and uncertain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them who firſt gave being and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
to it; for they ſcarce ever agree,
except it be as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Saducees,</hi> or as
<hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> did of old, againſt Chriſt.</p>
               <p>7. LET them go then, and put an end
to their own Quarrels, <hi>Vnity and Agreement
do excellently become Religion;</hi> yet it is no
certain and proper ſign of the Church of
God; for there was a wonderful Agreement
amongſt them who worſhipped the <hi>Golden Calf,</hi>
and amongſt thoſe, who with one Voice cried
out againſt our Saviour, <hi>Crucifie him, crucifie
him.</hi> Nor are we preſently to determine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there was ſome Diſſentions in the
Church of <hi>Corinth;</hi> or becauſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with St. <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>Barnabas</hi> with St. <hi>Paul;</hi>
or that the Chriſtians in the Infancy of the
Church, diſagreed amongſt themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
ſome things, that therefore there was
no Church of God amongſt them. Thoſe
very men whom they contemptuouſly call
<hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Zuinglians,</hi> are both of them
Chriſtians, and Friends each to others, and
Brethren; they do not diſagree about the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99001:64"/>
Principles and Foundations of our Religion,
concerning God or Chriſt, or the Holy
Ghoſt, not concerning the manner of our
Juſtification, or of eternal Life; it is only
about one Point, and that of no great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence;
nor do we deſpair, or rather, we
do not ſo much as doubt, but that in a ſmall
time an Agreement will be made betwixt
them; and tho there are ſome who now
think otherwiſe than they ought, we hope
that laying aſide all Paſſions and Factious
Names and Reproaches, God will reveal to
them what they now know not, and having
better conſidered and ſearched into the thing,
as it happened heretofore in the Council of
<hi>Calcedon,</hi> all the Cauſes and Fibers of Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ſhall be pluck'd up by the Roots, and
buried in eternal <hi>Oblivion.</hi> Amen.</p>
               <p>8. BUT the moſt inſufferable of all their
Slanders, is their Pretence that we are impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Men, and have caſt off all care of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But this is the leſs to be regarded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they who make this Objection, do
themſelves know, that it is contumelious and
falſe. And <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> writes alſo, that
when the Goſpel was firſt publiſhed, and the
Name of Chriſt diſcovered to the World,
that all Chriſtians were then ſtiled <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>;
that is, Men without a God, or <hi>Atheiſts.</hi>
And when the Holy <hi>Polycarp,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
ſtood before the Tribunal,<note place="margin">Euſeb. H. 3: Lib. 4.</note> the Rabble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
the <hi>Proconſul</hi> to the Slaughter and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of all thoſe who profeſſed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
with theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
exterminate out of the World thoſe wicked
men who have no God. Not that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99001:64"/>
had indeed no God, but becauſe they
would not adore the Stones and Blocks which
were then worſhipped as Gods. But the
World now ſees plainly what we and ours
have ſuffered from them, for the Sake of God
and our Religion. They have caſt us into
Goals, and Fire, and Water, and have rol'd
themſelves in our Bloods, not becauſe we are
Adulterers, or Thieves, or Murtherers, but
purely becauſe we imbrace the Goſpel of
Jeſus Chriſt, and put our whole Truſt only in
the living God; and, O good God! becauſe
we truly and juſtly complain, that they have
for their moſt impertinent Traditions, viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Laws of God; and that theſe Enemies
of ours, who knowingly and willingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
the Commandments of God, are the
haters of the Goſpel, and the Enemies of the
Croſs of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>9. NOW theſe Men, when they ſaw they
could ſix no Slanders upon our <hi>Doctrine,</hi> then
they began to declaim againſt our Manners;
<hi>that we hated all good Works, that we made
way for Diſorder and Luxury, and did drive the
People off from all Care and Exerciſe of Virtue.</hi>
And certainly the Lives of all Men, even
thoſe of the moſt Holy and Chriſtian Men,
now are, and ever were, even in the beſt and
moſt chaſt ſtate of things, liable to ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
on that account; and ſuch is the
Propenſity of men to do Ill on the one ſide,
and the Proneneſs of all to Suſpition on the
other, that many things which were never
done nor thought of, have yet been pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be heard, and have obtained a Belief
too; and as a ſmall Spot is eaſily ſeen in a
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:99001:65"/>
very white, Garment, ſo in the pureſt courſe
of Life, the ſlighteſt Note of Turpitude or
diſorder, is eaſily taken notice of. Nor do
we think our ſelves, or all thoſe who have
imbraced the Reformation, to be Angels, and
to live without the leaſt Speck or Uneven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
or that thoſe who hate us, are ſo blind,
that they cannot obſerve whatever is blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in us, even through the ſmalleſt Chink;
or that they are ſo candid, as that they will
put a mild Senſe upon any thing; or ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious,
that they will at any time turn
their Eyes upon themſelves, and eſtimate or
compare our Manners with their own. But
then if we ſhould here run the thing up to
the Fountains head, we know that in the
Apoſtles times, there were Chriſtians who
made the Name of God to be blaſphem'd and
evil ſpoken of amongſt the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>10. CONSTANTIUS <hi>the Emperor
complains in</hi> Sozomen, that many after they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
the Chriſtian Church, became worſe than
they were before. <hi>And St.</hi> Cyprian, <hi>in a
mournful Oration, deſcribes the Corruptions,
of his own times.</hi> Eaſe and a long Peace
(<hi>ſaith he</hi>) had deſtroyed that Diſcipline which
the Apoſtles delivered to us. Men were intent
upon the enlarging their Eſtates, and forgetting
what Believers did under the Apoſtles, and what
they ever ought to do; they applied themſelves
with an inſatiable Appetite to the Improvement of
their Fortunes.<note place="margin">By <hi>Miniſters</hi> here, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Decons are meant.</note> There is not now that devout Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
in the Prieſts, that ſincere Faith in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
that Compaſſion in Works of Mercy, that
Reſtraint in Mens Manners; Men colour their
Beards, and Women paint their Faces. <hi>And
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99001:65"/>
before him,</hi> Tertullian. O wo to us who are
now call'd Chriſtians! for we live the Lives of
Heathens under that venerable Title.</p>
               <p>11. To conclude, and not to trouble the
Reader with many Authors, <hi>Gregory Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen</hi>
ſpeaks thus, of the deplorable State
of his own times. <hi>We are</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>hated by
the Heathens now for our Vices, and we are made
a Spectacle, not only to Men and Angels, but to
the wickedeſt of Men.</hi> This was the State of
the Church of God, when the Light of the
Goſpel began firſt to ſhine upon it, when the
Fury of Tyrants was not yet aſſwaged, or
the Sword diverted from the necks of the
Chriſtians; in truth, it is no wonder that
Men are Men, tho they are call'd Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>

diſſolute Life, was the Head of their Church,
and when for two years ſhe had in that Holy

at lenght, in a publick Proceſſion, in the
ſight of all the Cardinals and Biſhops, in the
open Street ſhe brought forth a Child?</p>
               <p>3. BUT why ſhould we mention their
Concubines and Pimping? for theſe are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and publick Crimes at <hi>Rome,</hi> and not
unprofitable neither; for the <hi>Miſſes</hi> there do
not ſit without the Gates with their Faces

And whoever he was who wrote the

               </p>
               <p>4. BUT theſe things are not only uſual,
and even for the ſake of the Cuſtom approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(as moſt of their Vices are;) but they are
now become ſo well known by their long uſe,
that they are putid <hi>ripe for Iudgment.</hi> For

wrote of a Sin to be abhorred; whilſt

only becauſe he had imbraced the Goſpel,
and would not return to <hi>Rome,</hi> which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly

and that there is excellent Laws againſt

               <p>5. Be it ſo, But what Law paſſed upon

of the hands of the Law, by the Interpoſition
of the <hi>Pope. Johannes Caſa,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of
<hi>Benevento,</hi> is yet alive, and at <hi>Rome,</hi> and live,
under the Eyes, and in the Sight of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
They have ſtain infinite numbers of our
Brethren, only becauſe they truly and purely
believed in Jeſus Chriſt; but then of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
number of Harlots, Sodomites and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterers,
who have they at any time, I will
not ſay ſlain, but excommunicated, or ſo
much as touched? What are Fornications
Adulteries, Pimping, Sodomy, Parricides,
Inceſts and the like, no sins at <hi>Rome?</hi> or if
they be, why are they ſo eaſily born, as it
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99001:67"/>
they were not Sins, in the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> that
Bulwark of Sanctity; and by the Pope, <hi>the
Vicar of Chriſt, the Succeſſor of</hi> St. <hi>Peter, that
moſt holy Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. O Holy <hi>Scribes and Phariſees,</hi> to whom
this Sanctity was never known! O Sanctity
and Catholick Faith! St. <hi>Peter</hi> did never
teach theſe things at <hi>Rome,</hi> nor St. <hi>Paul</hi> live
there at this rate. They did not publickly
exerciſe the Trade of Pimping, they took no
Tribute of the Whores; they did not openly
and freely tolerate Adulterers and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricides;
they did not admit them into their
Boſoms, their Families, their Councils, nor into
the Congregations of Chriſtian Men. Theſe
Men ought not to have aggravated ſo much
the Faults of our Lives; it had been much
better to have approved their own to the
World, or at leaſt, to have concealed them a
little more from the Eyes of Men.</p>
               <p>7. FOR as for us, we retain and uſe our
ancient Paternal Laws; and adminiſter
Church Diſcipline ſeriouſly and diligently as
far as we poſſibly can, in ſo much Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all things, both as to Manners and
Times; we have no <hi>Stews</hi> nor Herds of
Harlots and Concubines; nor do we prefer

or rather, becauſe the People are now
better inſtructed in the matters of Obedience

them to their Allegiance and Duty.</p>
               <p>13. AND whereas ſome ignorant men
have objected that the <hi>Switzars</hi> murthered
<hi>Leopold</hi> the Arch-Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

when the Papal Power was at the higheſt,
about two hundred years before <hi>Huldericus

was born. But from that time to this, all
things there have been in the greateſt Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

ſo that if it were a ſin to deliver their

the Majeſty of the Emperor, and that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth,
becauſe God made two great Lights

by any means hateful, did thereupon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
the People that the Chriſtians were
impious Men; that they offered Humane
Sacrifices, and drank Mans Blood; and when
the Chriſtians ſaid with God, there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Male nor Female, that is, that as to the
obtaining of Juſtification, there is no diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Perſons, and did ſalute one another
commonly by the Names of Brother and
Siſter; there were not wanting ſome who
ſlandered the Chriſtians thereupon,<note place="margin">Idem. cap. 39.</note> and ſaid,
they made no diſtinction amongſt them of
Sex or Age, but like Beaſts, promiſcuouſly
lay together. And when they met frequently
in Vaults and ſecret places to Pray and hear
the Goſpel, which ſort of private Places and
Meetings, had ſometimes been made uſe of
by Conſpirators againſt the Government;
there was thereupon a Rumor ſpread abroad,
that they conſpired together, and had ſecret
Conſultations about murthering the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
and ſubverting the Government. And
becauſe in celebrating the Holy Communion,
they made uſe of Bread and Wine, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Inſtitution of Chriſt, they were
thought by many not to worſhip Chriſt, but
<hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Ceres,</hi> becauſe thoſe heathen De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities
were worſhiped by the <hi>Pagans</hi> with a like
Rite, with <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine.</hi> Theſe things
were then believed by many, not becauſe
they were true (for what could poſſibly be
leſs ſo?) but becauſe they had a kind of reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of Truth, and by that ſhew of truth
were fitted to deceive them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:99001:73"/>
18. SO they traduce us, and ſay, that as
Hereticks we have departed from the Unity
of the Catholick Church, and the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Chriſt; not that they believe this to
be true (nor are they at all concern'd whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be true or falſe) but becauſe the thing
may in ſome ſort ſeem true to ignorant Men;
for we have indeed departed, not as Hereticks
ever have done, from the Church of Chriſt;
but, as good men ought to do, from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion
of wicked Men and Hypocrites; and
yet here they inſult wonderfully, that theirs
is the Church, the Spouſe of Chriſt, the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
of Truth, the Ark of <hi>Noah,</hi> out of which,
no Salvation is to be hoped for; and in the
interim, they aſſert with the ſame Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that we have revolted, that we have
rent the Coat of Chriſt, and torn our ſelves
from his Body, and made a deſection from
the Catholick Faith. And when they have
thus left nothing unſaid, which can poſſibly
be (tho never ſo falſly and ſlanderouſly) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
againſt us, yet at laſt they cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that we have forſaken the Word of God,
or the Apoſtles of Chriſt, or the Primitive
Church.</p>
               <p>19. NOW we have ever thought, that the
Primitive Church which was in the times of
Chriſt and the Apoſtles and holy Fathers,
was the Catholick Church. Nor do we
doubt, but that that Church is the Ark of
<hi>Noah,</hi> the Spouſe of Chriſt, the Pillar and
Foundation of Truth; or to place in it all
the Hopes of our Salvation. It is indeed an
odious thing to break off and depart from
that Society a Man has long lived in, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:99001:74"/>
if that Society conſiſt of Men who ſeem
to be, and are therefore called Chriſtians,
tho in truth they are none. And in reality,
we do not ſo contemn their Church, as bad
as it now is, (for the Name ſake, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

of God, was by the Scribes and Phariſees
turn'd into a Den of Thieves? for the Church

of Wheat it will bring forth <hi>Thiſtles,

time to time, ſent Prophets and Meſſengers,
and at laſt Chriſt himſelf, to reduce the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
into the right way, and to reſtore the

Beauty. And now let no man ſay theſe
things could only happen under the Law,
when the Church was under the Shadow, and
in her Infancy; when Truth was covered
with Figures and Ceremonies, and nothing
was yet brought to perfection; when the Law
was not written on the Hearts of Men, but
on Tables of Stone: (tho this Pretence is very

many of the Fathers and pious and learned
Men have oftentimes grievouſly complain'd
that there Predictions were come to paſs in
their times. For God, in the midſt of that
Darkneſs, would that there ſhould be ſome
men, who ſhould as Sparks be obſerved by

Men, tho they could not give them a very

when things were in ſome ſort ſincere

                  <hi>that they did ill

the Prophets of God remaining willingly, or
being forcibly put into them, prophecied by the

of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who firſt commanded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

<hi>there is nothing ſound in the Clergy now, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is nothing remaining but the Revelation

All <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Aſia</hi> complained that the

and Sales of Indulgences, had both of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
Violence to the Conſciences of Men,

               <p>25. <hi>Laurentius Valla, Marſilius Patavinus,
Franciſcus Petrarcha, Hieronymus Savana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rola,
Abbas Joachimus, Baptiſta Mantuanus,</hi>
and before them all, St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> have very
often grievouſly complain'd of the Tyranny
and Perſian Pride of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
have not obſcurely hinted (whether true or
falſly, I will not inquire) that the Pope was
Antichriſt; not to mention a number of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who, becauſe they have freely and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly
reprehended the Vices of the Popes,
will perhaps be numbred by them amongſt
their Enemies; but all theſe I have named,
lived either at <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, or under the eyes
of theſe moſt Holy Fathers, and were inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately
acquainted with their way of living,
and did never depart from their Catholick
Faith. Neither can any man object that
theſe were <hi>Lutherans</hi> or <hi>Zuinglians,</hi> for they
lived not only ſome few years, but ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Ages before the Names of theſe Men
were heard of in the World; and they ſaw al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
even then, that Errors were crept into the
Church, and deſired they might be amended.
And where was the Wonder if the Church
fell into ſome Errors in thoſe times, in which
neither the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who alone had
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:99001:79"/>
the chiefeſt Management of Affairs, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
any other Perſons either <hi>did;</hi> or indeed
underſtood what was their Duty; for it is not
credible, that in that time, in which they
were ſo idle and drowſie, the Devil was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
a ſleep or idle too. For what kind
of men they were, and with what fidelity
they took care of the Houſe of God; tho we
are ſilent, they may be pleaſed to hear their
own St. <hi>Bernard. Thoſe Biſhops</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to
whom the Church of God is now committed, are
not Teachers, but Seducers; not Paſtors, but Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors;
not Prelates, but Pilates.</hi> Thus St. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi>
wrote then of him that call'd himſelf the
<hi>Great Pontiff,</hi> and of the Biſhops, who then ſate
at the Helm. He was no Heretick, he was no
<hi>Lutheran,</hi> he never forſook their Church, and
yet he never ſtuck at calling thoſe Biſhops
they then had, <hi>Seducers, Impoſtors, Pilates.</hi> And
now when the People were openly ſeduced,
and Chriſtians impoſed upon, and <hi>Pilate</hi>
mounted the Tribunal and adjudged Chriſt
and his Members to the Fire and Sword; O
good God! in what condition was the
Church then? And now of ſo many and ſuch
groſs Errors, what one Error have they reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to this day? yea, what one Error have they
at any time acknowledged and confeſſed.</p>
               <p>26. BUT now, whereas they pretend to
be in Poſſeſſion of the whole Catholick
Church, and call us Hereticks, becauſe we
do not agree with them. Let us ſee what
Mark that Church hath of the Church of
God: Nor is the Church of God very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to be found, if you ſeriouſly and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
ſeek for it; for it is placed in an high
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:99001:79"/>
and illuſtrious Place, and built on the top of a
Mountain, and the Foundations of it are laid
upon the Apoſtles and Prophets.<note place="margin">Epheſians 2. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>There</hi>
(ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtin) let us ſeek the Church, there

                  <note place="margin">De <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitate Eccl. cap. 3. Ib. cap. 4.</note> and in another place he
ſaith, <hi>the Church is to be ſhown cut of the ſacred

not whence it proceeds, whether from Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
or Conſcience, or a deſpair of Victory,
that theſe men always dread and ſhun the
Word of God, as much as a Thief does the
Gallows; and in truth it is no Wonder, for
as they ſay, a Beetle is preſently extinguiſhed
in <hi>Opobalſam,</hi> altho it is a moſt fragrant
Oyntment: So they ſee their Cauſe is
ſuffocated and ruined when ever it comes
near the Scriptures, which are a ſort of dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Poyſon to it. Therefore they accuſtom
themſelves to call the Holy Scriptures, which
our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt did not only cite on
all occaſions,<note place="margin">Our Saviour reſigned up his Soul to his Father in the Words of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi> Luk. 23. 46. Pſal. 31. 5.</note> but at the laſt, ſealed them
with his Blood: that they may drive the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
from them, as if they were dangerous and
deſtructive, with the greater facility; theſe
very Scriptures I ſay, they call a cold, uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
unprofitable, dumb, killing, dead Letter,
which ſeems to us to be the ſame thing as if
they ſhould wholly deny them to be the Word
of God: And beſides all this, they commonly
add a no very proper Simile too.<note place="margin">Pighius in Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchia.</note> 
                  <hi>They are</hi> (ſay
they) <hi>a Noſe of Wax, and may be form'd and ſet
all manner of ways, and be made to ſerve all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Purpoſes.</hi> Does the Pope not know that
that theſe things are ſaid by his Followers?
Does he not underſtand what kind of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
he has?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:99001:80"/>
27. LET the Pope then be pleaſed to hear
how piouſly and how holily <hi>Hoſius</hi> a certain
<hi>Polander,</hi> and a Biſhop, as he ſaith himſelf, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
an eloquent and not unlearned man,
and a ſharp and violent defender of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
writes concerning the Scriptures. I
believe he will admire a pious man could
poſſibly entertain ſuch impious Thoughts, or
write ſo contemptuouſly of thoſe very words
which he knew proceeded from the Mouth of
God; and above all that, he ſhould ſeem to
deſire that it might not paſs for his Senſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
but the common Opinion of the whole
Popiſh Party. <hi>We</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>have bid adieu to
the Scriptures, having ſeen ſo many, not only diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
but contrary Interpretations given of them;
let us then rather hear God himſelf ſpeak, then
apply our ſelves and truſt our Salvation to thoſe
jejune Elements: There is no need of being Skilful
in the Law and Scriptures, but of being taught by
God: That Labour is ill imployed that is beſtowed
on the Scriptures, for the Scripture is a Creature
and a poor kind of Element.</hi> Thus far <hi>Hoſius,</hi>
in his Book of the expreſs <hi>Word of God,</hi> in
this place craftily, under the Perſon of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Man, tho he ſpeaks the ſame thing in
ſeveral other places in the ſame Book, as his
own Opinion without any diſguiſe: which is
ſaid with the ſame Spirit and Affection, as
the like things were heretofore by <hi>Montanus</hi>
and <hi>Marcion,</hi> who are reported frequently to
have ſaid, when they contemptuouſly rejected
the Holy Scriptures, that <hi>they knew more and
better things than either Chriſt or his Apoſtles
ever knew.</hi> What then ſhall I ſay on this
Occaſion? O ye Pillars of Religion! O ye
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:99001:80"/>
Preſidents of the Church of Chriſt! is this
the Reverence ye pay to the Word of God?
Do ye bid an <hi>Adieu</hi> to the Sacred Scriptures,
which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith are divinely inſpir'd,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 16.</note>
which the Holy God hath illuſtrated by ſo
many Miracles, in which the certain Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps
of Jeſus Chriſt are imprinted, which
were cited as Teſtimonies by all the Holy
Fathers, by the Apoſtles, by Chriſt himſelf
the Son of God, when occaſion requir'd it?
do ye (I ſay) bid adieu to theſe, as if they
were not worthy of your regard? that is,
do ye impoſe ſilence upon God, who it is
that ſpeaks clearly to you in the Scriptures?
Or will you call that Word a <hi>poor and a dead</hi>
Element, by which only, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
we are <hi>reconcil'd to God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 19.</note> and which, as the
Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Pſal. 19. 8.</note> is <hi>Holy and Pure and
ſhall endure for ever?</hi> Or will you ſay, that all
the Pains we ſpend in that which Chriſt
commanded us to ſearch diligently, and to
have ever in our Eye, is loſt? and that Chriſt
and the Apoſtles, when they exhorted the
People to a careful Peruſal of the Scriptures,
that they might thereby abound in all
Knowledge and Wiſdom, deſigned only to
delude and abuſe Men? It is no wonder
that theſe men deſpiſe us and our Writings
who thus undervalue God himſelf and his
Oracles; but it was a moſt fooliſh Action to
offer ſo great an Affront to the Word of
God, that they might do us a ſmall miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</p>
               <p>28. AND now, as if all this were too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
they commit the Holy Scriptures to the
Fire, as the wicked King <hi>Jehojakim,</hi> and as
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:99001:81"/>
                  <hi>Antiochus</hi> and <hi>Maximinus,</hi> two Heathen Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors,
did, calling them the Books of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;
and they ſeem altogether diſpoſed to
imitate <hi>Herod</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> in what he did for
the eſtabliſhing of his Power; for he being
an <hi>Idumaean</hi> of another Race and Blood then
the <hi>Jews</hi> were, and deſiring to be thought a
<hi>Jews,</hi> that ſo he might the better ſettle that
his Kingdom over them, which he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
from <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> he commanded
all their Genealogies which they kept in
their Publick Regiſter, and were carefully
preſerved from <hi>Abrahams</hi> times, (by which,
without any Error, it was eaſie to find of
which Tribe any perſon was deſcended) to
be burnt and aboliſhed,<note place="margin">Euſeb. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</note> that there might be
nothing to be found for the future, by which
it might be proved he was of another Nation.
So theſe men, pretending that all their Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
were conſigned to them by Chriſt
and his Apoſtles, and deſiring they ſhould be
accordingly eſteemed, leſt there ſhould be
any thing any where extant, which might
contradict theſe Dreams and Shams, either
burn or ſuppreſs the Scriptures, and keep
them from the People. St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> has
written very well and appoſitely againſt ſuch
men as theſe;<note place="margin">In opere im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfecto.</note> 
                  <hi>Hereticks</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhut the
Gates of Truth, for they know if they be kept open,
the Church will never be thought theris.</hi> And
<hi>Theophylact</hi> ſtiles the <hi>Word of God a Candle, by
the Light of which, a Thief may be diſcovered.</hi>
And <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, <hi>the Scriptures convict the
Frauds and Thefts of Hereticks:</hi> For why elſe
do they hide and ſuppreſs the Goſpel, which
Chriſt commanded his Diſciples to publiſh
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:99001:81"/>
from the Houſe top? Why elſe do they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to put that Candle under a Buſhel,
which ought to be ſet in a Candleſtick? Why
do they truſt more to the Ignorance, Blindneſs,
and Folly of the Multitude, than to the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their Cauſe? Do they think their Arts
are not diſcloſed? or that, as if they had
<hi>Gyges</hi> his Ring, they can go undiſcovered?
The World ſees now with both Eyes, what
is ſo carefully locked up in the Cabinet of
the Popes Breaſt; this one Argument is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to prove they do not act well and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely:
that Cauſe deſerves to be ſuſpected,
which declines a Scrutiny, and hates the
Light; for as Chriſt ſaith,<note place="margin">John 3. 20.</note> he that doth Evil
ſeeks Darkneſs and hates the Light, but a
mind conſcious of what is good, willingly
comes forth, that the Works which come
from God may be ſeen; but theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are not ſo blind, but they ſee what will
become of their Kingdom, if the Scriptures
come once to be generally known; and as
it is ſaid of old, all the Idols of the Demons,
which before gave Oracles, ſuddenly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
dumb upon the appearance of Chriſt
upon Earth; ſo now will all their Arts, at
the approach of the Goſpel,<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2. 8.</note> ſink down into
Ruins and Rubbiſh, for Antichriſt is not to
be depoſed by any other thing than the
Brightneſs of the coming of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>29. WE do not, like them, preſently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
our ſelves to Fire and Sword, but to the
Scriptures, nor do we aſſault them with force
and Arms, but with the Word of God. By
them, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, we nouriſh our
Faith, by them we erect our Hope, by them
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:99001:82"/>
we eſtabliſh our Confidence; for we know
that the Goſpel of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is the Power
of God unto Salvation, and that in it there
is eternal life, and as St. <hi>Paul</hi> admoniſheth us,
we would refuſe to hear an Angel of God

and from the Arch-Angel <hi>Raphael.</hi> So our

But now, what if thoſe things they pretend

<hi>hath ſpoken of me:</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, of the
Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, which many thought
to be new, that it had the moſt Ancient Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
of the Law and the Prophets. And
our Doctrine, which we may much better
call the Catholick Doctrine of Chriſt, is not
ſo new, but that it is commended to us by
the Ancient of days, the Father of our Lord
Jeſus Chriſt, in moſt ancient Monuments,
the Prophets and Goſpels, and the Writings
of the Apoſtles; and theſe cannot now ſeem
new to any man, but to him to whom the
Faith of the Prophets, the Goſpel, and Chriſt
himſelf ſeems new. But then as to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
if it be ſo ancient as they pretend,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:99001:84"/>
why do they not prove it ſo from the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the Primitive Church, from the old
Fathers and the antient Councils? Why doth
ſo antient a Cauſe lye deſolate and without a
Patron ſo very long? Indeed they never
want Fire and Swords; but then as to the
ancient Fathers and Councils, there is with
them a deep ſilence. But it is the height of
Abſurdity and Folly to begin with thoſe
bloody and brutiſh Reaſons, if they could
poſſibly have found out eaſier and milder Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
               <p>4. AND again, if they do indeed intirely
truſt to Antiquity, and do not diſſemble any
thing, why did one <hi>John Clement,</hi> an Engliſh
man, rend and burn ſome Leaves of <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,</hi>

and Civil) Swords; and (ſaith he) if thou
wilt have both, thou deceiveſt thy ſelf and
thoſe that hear thee; but now the Pope
claims both, and bears both, and therefore
the Wonder ought to ſeem the leſs, if that
hath followed which <hi>Clement</hi> foretold, and
he hath accordingly deceived himſelf and
thoſe which have heard him. 13. Pope <hi>Leo</hi>
ſaith, it is not lawful to celebrate more than
one Maſs in one Day, in one Church; they
ſay every day ſometimes ten, at others twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and at other thirty, and ſometimes more
in the ſame Church, at the ſame time, ſo that
the miſerable Spectator knows not which
way to turn him. 14. <hi>Gelaſius</hi> the Pope
ſaith, that if any man divide the Sacrament,
and when he has received one part, refuſeth
the other, he doth act Wickedly and Sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly;
but they, contrary to the Word of
God, and the Decree of this Pope, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
only one part of the Euchariſt to be
given to the People, and by ſo doing, have
made their Prieſts guilty of Sacriledge.</p>

6. BUT now if they ſhall pretend that
all theſe things are antiquated and worn out
of uſe, and ſo are in a ſort dead, and do not
concern our times, yet that men may ſee
what Faith is to be given to theſe Men, and
with what Hope they call Councils, let us
conſider in a few inſtances, how well they
obſerve thoſe things which have been ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of late years, and which are freſh in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
by Councils which they pretend were
lawfully called, and in which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
decreed thoſe things I ſhall mention,
to be Religiouſly obſerved. In the laſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Trent,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">March 3d. 1547.</note> not much above fourteen years
ſince, it was decreed by the common Vote of
all Orders there preſent,<note place="margin">Pluralities.</note> 
                  <hi>that two Benefices
ſhould not be committed at one time to the ſame
Perſon.</hi> Where is that <hi>Sanction</hi> now? Is that
ſo ſoon antiquated and dead too? for they
do frequently give not only two Benefices,
but ſometimes alſo ſeveral Monaſteries too,
and ſometimes two, three or four Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks
to one Man, and he too ſometimes not
only unlearned, and conſequently thereby
unfit for them, but a Soldier. In the ſame
Council it was decreed, that <hi>all Biſhops ought
to preach the Goſpel;</hi> but they never Preach,
nor ever come in a Pulpit, nor do they
think it in the leaſt any part of their Duty.
What then is the meaning of all that ſhew of
Antiquity? Why do they glory ſo in the
Names of the Fathers, and of the ancient and
modern Councils? Why would they ſo fain
ſeem to rely upon their Authority, whom, as
occaſion ſerve, at their Pleaſure they deſpiſe?</p>
               <p>7. BUT I have a great deſire to have a
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:99001:87"/>
little diſcourſe with the Pope himſelf, and to
tell him ſome things to his Face. Be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:99001:87"/>
now we are in, we may inquire of a fow o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things of the ſame Nature. What one
Man of all the ancient Biſhops and Fathers
ever taught you to ſay a private Maſs, whilſt
the People did nothing but look on; or to lift
the Euchariſt above your Head, in which you
now place all your Religion; or to curtail
the Sacrament of Chriſt, and contrary to his
Inſtitution and expreſs Command, to deprive
the People of one half of it? And that we
may conclude what one of all the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
taught you, to diſpence the Blood of
Chriſt, and the Merits of the Martyrs, and
to ſell your Indulgences and all the Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Lodgings of Purgatory, like Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
in the Market for Money? They are
wont often to celebrate their own wonderful
ſecret Learning, and their manifold and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Readings. Now let your Partizans at
laſt produce ſomething of it if they can, or
let them at leaſt ſhew they have read, and do
know more than or dinary; for they have often
made hideous Outcries amongſt their Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
that all the parts of their Religion are
ancient, and approved, not only by the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
but alſo by the Continuance and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of all Nations and Times.</p>
               <p>8. WELL, then let them at leaſt ſhew
this their boaſted Antiquity; let them make
it appear, that what they ſo much extol is
indeed of ſo vaſt an Extent; let them prove
that all Chriſtian Nations have imbraced
their Religion. But alaſs! (as I ſaid before)
they flee from their own <hi>Decrees,</hi> and have
already pluckt up thoſe Canons which but a
very few years ſince they made to laſt for
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:99001:88"/>
ever. Why then ſhould we truſt them in
relation to what they pretend concerning the
Fathers, the ancient Councils, and the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures?
They have not, O good God! they
have not, on their ſides, what they pretend
to have; they have neither Antiquity, nor
Univerſality, nor the conſent of either all
times, or all Nations. And of this they are
not ignorant themſelves, tho they craftily
diſſemble their Knowledge: Yea, at times
they will not obſcurely confeſs it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſometimes they will alledge, that the
Sanctions of the ancient Councils and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
are ſuch as may lawfully be changed,
<hi>for different Decrees</hi> (ſay they) <hi>will beſt ſuit the
different State of the Church in different times</hi>
And ſo they hide themſelves under the name
of the <hi>Church,</hi> and by a wretched ſham de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
Mankind. And in truth it is a great
wonder that Men ſhould be ſo blind, as not
to ſee theſe things; or if they do ſee them
ſo patient, as to bear and indure them with
that ſtupidity and unconcernment they ſeem
to have.</p>
               <p>9. BUT tho they have abrogated the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
of the ancient Councils, as too old and
overworn, yet perhaps they have ſettled ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
and more uſeful Rules in their place; for they
have the confidence to ſay, that if Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
or his Apoſtles, ſhould ariſe from the
Dead, they could not adminiſter the Affairs
of the Church of God better or more piouſly
than it is now adminiſtered by them: Indeed
they have put others in the place of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:<note place="margin">XXIII. 28. I. 12.</note>
but as <hi>Jeremias</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chaff inſtead of
Wheat,</hi> or as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>What God never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:99001:88"/>
at their Hands;</hi> for they have ſtopped
up all the veins of Living Waters, and have
hewen for the People of God, <hi>broken and
polluted Ciſterns,</hi> being full of mud and dregs,
which neither have in them any pure Water,
nor can hold it if it were put into them. They
have torn from the People the Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion;
the word of God from which all
true Comfort could only be expected; the
true Worſhip of God; the right uſe of the
Sacraments and Prayers of the Church; and
they have given us to pleaſe our ſelves withall
in the mean time, of their own pure inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
conſecrated <hi>Salts, Waters, Oyls, Spittle,
Palmes, Bulls, Jubiles, Indulgences, Croſſes,
Cenſings,</hi> and an infinite number of <hi>Ceremonies.</hi>
And as <hi>Plautus</hi> calls others of the like nature,
<hi>Ludos Ludificabiles,</hi> Shews and Pageants, that are
very divertiſing, and good for nothing elſe.
In theſe things they have made all Religion
to conſiſt; and they have taught the People
that by theſe things God is rightly appeaſed,
and that by theſe things Devils are put to
flight, and the Conſciences of Men quieted
and confirmed. For theſe are the Paints and
Perfumes of Chriſtianity, theſe are the grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and acceptable things to the All-ſeeing
God; theſe are to be had in honour; that
Chriſt's and his Apoſtles Inſtitutions may be
taken away. And as heretofore the wicked
King <hi>Jeroboam</hi> when he had taken away the
true Service of God, and perſwaded the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
inſtead of it to accept the Golden Calves,
for fear they might change their minds, and
fall from him, and return to the <hi>Temple</hi> of
God at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> made a long Oration to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:99001:89"/>
them, <q>exhorting them to Conſtancy, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to them, <hi>Theſe are thy Gods</hi> O Iſrael;
thus did your God command you to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
him. But it would be very grievous
and troubleſome for you to take ſo long a
Journey, and to go up every year to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
and adore God at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                  </q> Even ſo
our Adverſaries when they had once by their
Traditions quaſh'd the Laws of God, leſt the
People ſhould afterwards open their Eyes and
fall off from them, and ſeek a better way of
aſſuring their Salvation. O how often have
they exclaimed that this is the true Worſhip
of God, which he is pleaſed with, and hath
required of us, and by which he will be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed
when he is angry! and that it is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
and troubleſome to the People to have
recourſe to Chriſt, and the Apoſtles and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and to attend perpetually what they
require of them. Is this their way of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the People of God off from the weak Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the World, from the leaven of the
<hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and from humane Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions?
Are the Commandments of Chriſt
and his Apoſtles to be taken away, that theſe
goodly things may ſucceed them? O moſt
righteous Cauſe, why ſhould an old Doctrine
which hath been approved for many Ages,
be antiquated, and a new Form of Religion
be brought into the Church of God! Ay (but
ſay they) be it what it will, nothing ought
to be changed, the minds of Men are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous
well ſatisfied with theſe things; the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has ſo decreed, and ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
err; for <hi>Sylveſter Prierias</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the
Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is the Rule and Model of Truth;
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:99001:89"/>
and that the Holy Scriptures have received from
her all their Faith and Authority. The Doctrine</hi>
(ſaith he again) <hi>of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>is the
infallible Rule of Faith, from whence the Holy
Scriptures have all their ſtrength. For Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
were not made known to us by the Authority
of Scriptures; but they were made known by the
Authority of the Church, and Popes of</hi> Rome,
<hi>which is greater than the Scriptures. Pighius</hi>
doth not fear to ſay, that <hi>without the command
of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>we are not to believe the
moſt clear place of Scripture:</hi> Which is juſt as
if one of thoſe who cannot ſpeak good and
pure <hi>Latin,</hi> and yet by uſe and cuſtom has
got the faculty readily and fluently to blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
on in the <hi>Lawyer's Latin,</hi> ſhould therefore
ſtand ſtoutly to it, that all others are bound
to ſpeak it after the ſame manner, that was
many years ſince in uſe with <hi>Mammetrectus</hi>
and the <hi>Catholicon,</hi> which they ſtill uſe in their
Pleadings; becauſe by that means men might
very eaſily be underſtood, and their Humours
might be gratified: but on the other ſide that
it were ridiculous to trouble the World now
with a new way of ſpeaking, and to reduce
into practice again the old Purity and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue uſed in the times
of <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10. SO much are they indebted to the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
and blindneſs of the former times,
that as one ſaith, <hi>Many things are often had in
great eſteem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">C. Plinius.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe they were once dedicated to
the Service of the Gods.</hi> So now we ſee many
things are magnified and applauded by them,
not becauſe they judge them worthy of this
Eſteem; but only becauſe by Cuſtom they
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:99001:90"/>
were once received, and thereby in a ſort de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
to the Service of God. <hi>But they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that their Church cannot Err.</hi> I ſuppoſe
they ſpeak this in the ſame ſenſe as the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians</hi>
were wont to ſay, there was no ſuch
thing as Adultery in their Common-wealth,
when in truth they were all Adulterers, and
uſed an uncertain ſort of Marriages, and had
their Wives in common. Or, as the Hungry
Canoniſts now ſay of the Pope, that he being
Lord of all Benefices, altho he ſells Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks,
Monaſteries, and Livings, and ſuffers
nothing to go from him without Money:
yet becauſe he claims all theſe as his own,
tho he would, yet he cannot commit Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
But then how well or rationally this is
ſpoken, we poor Men cannot ſee or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand;
except as the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> ſerved
<hi>Victory,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> ſo they have ſerved <hi>Truth,</hi> for when
ſhe once came flying to them, they clipt
her Wings that ſhe might no more ſly from
them. But what if <hi>Jeremias</hi> ſhould tell them,
as we have obſerved above, that <hi>theſe are lying
Words?</hi> And what again if he ſhould ſay,<note place="margin">XII. 9.</note>
                  <hi>That many Paſtors</hi> (who ought to have dreſſed)
<hi>have deſtroyed my Vineyard?</hi> What if Chriſt
ſhould ſay, that thoſe who ſhould have taken
the greateſt care of the Temple, have made
<hi>the Houſe of God a D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n of Thieves?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. XX. 13.</note> For if the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot Err, ſhe is more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
to her own good Fortune, than to
their Prudence or Care; for ſuch are their
Lives, Doctrines, and Diligence, that if we
are to take our Meaſures from thence, this
Church is not only in danger of falling into
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rror, but of a total Ruine and Deſtruction:
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:99001:90"/>
And certainly if that Church can err which
hath departed from the Word of God, the
Commandments of Chriſt, the Inſtitutions of
the Apoſtles, the Examples of the Primitive
Church, and from the Canons and Sanctions
of the ancient Fathers and Councils, yea, and
from her own too, which will be obliged by
neither old nor new Laws, by neither her
own nor any others, by neither Divine nor
Humane Laws; I ſay if all this be to err, then
it is certain that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> not only
may err, but that ſhe hath moſt wickedly and
lewdly erred.</p>
               <p>11. BUT they ſay we were once of their
Communion, but now we are Apoſtates, and
have departed from them; indeed we have
departed from them, and we bleſs the Great
and Holy God for it, and pleaſe our ſelves
mightily in it; but then we have not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from the Primitive Church, from the
Apoſtles, from Chriſt; we were educated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
with them in darkneſs and ignorance
of God, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was in the Diſcipline and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
of the <hi>Egyptians. We were of your Number</hi>
(ſaith <hi>Tertullian) and I confeſs it, but what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is there in that, Men are made, and not born
Chriſtians.</hi> But then I may as well ask them
why they have deſcended from the ſeven
Hills on which the ancient City of <hi>Rome</hi> ſtood,
to dwell in the Plains in the <hi>Martian</hi> Field;
to which perhaps they would reply, that the
<hi>Aquaeducts,</hi> without which they could not
conveniently dwell on thoſe Hills, have failed.
Let them then but grant the ſame liberty in
relation to the Waters of Life, which they
expect we ſhould afford them in regard of the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:99001:91"/>
common Family-water. The Springs did now
fail with them:<note place="margin">XIV. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>The Elders</hi> (ſaith <hi>Jeremiah)
ſent their little ones to the Waters, they came to
the Pits and found no Water, they returned with
their Veſſels empty; they were aſhamed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">XLI. 17.</note>
                  <hi>and covered their heads.</hi> Or, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi>
ſaith, <hi>The Poor and the Needy ſeek Water, and
there is none, and their Tongue faileth for thirſt.</hi>
They had broken all their Conduits and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-courſes;
they had ſtopped up all the
Springs, and covered the Fountain of Living
Waters with mire and mud; and as <hi>Caligula,</hi>
by ſhutting up all the publick Granaries, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
the People of <hi>Rome</hi> to faſt: ſo they
by ſtopping up the Fountains of the Word of
God, had enjoyned the People to undergo
the Miſeries of a deſtructive Thirſt; they have
(as the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> ſaith) brought upon the
World a Famine;<note place="margin">VIII. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Not a Famine of Bread, nor
a thirſt for Water, but of hearing the Words of
the Lord.</hi> Miſerable Men went ſearching
about for a ſmall ſpark of Divine Light to
chear their Conſciences, but they were all
gone out and they could find none; this was
the miſerable Condition and State of their
Church, men lived wretchedly in it with
out the Goſpel, and without Light or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation.</p>
               <p>12. AND therefore how afflictive ſoever
our departure from them may ſeem to them,
yet they ought at the ſame time to conſider
how juſt the cauſe of it was; for if they ſay
in general, it is not lawful to leave that Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in which thou wert educated; this were
in our Perſons to condemn the Prophets,
Apoſtles, and Chriſt himſelf; for why is it
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:99001:91"/>
not as reaſonable to blame <hi>Lot</hi> for leaving
<hi>Sodom, Abraham</hi> for leaving <hi>Chaldea,</hi> the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi>
for leaving <hi>Egypt,</hi> Chriſt for leaving
the <hi>Jews,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> for leaving the <hi>Phariſees?</hi>
For except it be granted that there may be a
juſt cauſe of departure, we can ſee no cauſe
why theſe may not in the ſame manner as
we are, be accuſed of Faction and Sedition.
But if we are to be thought Hereticks becauſe
we will not obey all their unjuſt commands,
what are they? Who or what are they to be
thought, who have contemned the Commands
of Chriſt and his Apoſtles? If we are Schif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks
who have forſaken them, by what
name ſhall we call them who have forſaken
the <hi>Greeks,</hi> from whom they firſt received the
Chriſtian Faith, the Primitive Church, Chriſt,
and the Apoſtles, who were their Spiritual Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents?
For the <hi>Greek</hi> Church who at this day
profeſs the Religion and Name of Chriſt:<note place="margin">The <hi>Grecian</hi> Church.</note>
altho they have in many things contaminated
it, yet they ſtill retain a great part of thoſe
things which they received from the Apoſtles.
And ſo they have no private Maſſes, no maimed
Sacraments, no Purgatory nor Indulgences:
And as to the Papal Titles and magnificent
Names, they have this eſteem of them, that
whoever calls himſelf the <hi>univerſal Biſhop,</hi> and
the <hi>Head of the whole Church,</hi> is a proud Man,
and injurious to all the other Biſhops who are
his Brethren, nor will they ſcruple on this
ſingle account to call him <hi>Heretick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>13. BUT now ſeeing it is apparent, and
cannot be denied, that they have made a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
from them, from whom they received
the Goſpel, the Chriſtian Faith and Religion,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:99001:92"/>
yea, and the very being of a Church; what
cauſe is there to be given, why they ſhould
not return back to them as to their Original?
Why ſhould they ſo much dread the times of
the Fathers and Apoſtles, as if they had ſeen
nothing? Why, do they ſee more, or love
the Church better than they who delivered
what they have, to them? for as for us we
have forſaken a Church in which we could
neither hear the pure Word of God, nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter
the Sacraments, nor invoke the Name
of God as we ought; which they themſelves
acknowledge to be faulty in many things, and
in which there was nothing to retain a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Man, who thought ſeriouſly of his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
Laſtly, We have departed from a
Church which is not now what anciently ſhe
was; and ſo we have departed, as <hi>Daniel</hi> did,
out of the Den of Lyons, as the three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
did out of the fiery Furnace; or to
ſpeak more properly, we have not ſo much
departed from them, as been caſt out by them
with Execrations and Curſes.</p>
               <p>14. BUT then we have united our ſelve
to that Church, in which if they would ſpea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
their minds truly and freely, they themſelve
cannot deny but that all things are purly and
reverently adminiſtred, and as far as we can
poſſibly, according to the Example and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the ancient times. Let them compare
their Church and ours together, and they will
ſoon ſee that they have moſt baſely departed
from the Apoſtles, and we have moſt juſtly
and reaſonably departed from them; for we,
with Chriſt and the Apoſtles, and Primitive
Fathers, give the intire and whole Euchariſt
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:99001:92"/>
to the People; but they contrary to the
Practice of all the Fathers and Apoſtles, and
of Chriſt himſelf, divide that Sacrament with
an high Sacrilege, as <hi>Gelaſius</hi> expreſſeth it, and
deprive the People of one half of it. 2. We
have recalled the Lords Supper to its firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
and have made it common to as
many as was poſſible, that it might be as it
is called a <hi>Communion:</hi> But they, contrary to
the Inſtitution of Chriſt, of a Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
have, made it a private Maſs; and ſo
we give the People the Lords Supper, they
entertain them with a vain Show. 3. We affirm
with the ancient Fathers, that the Body of
Chriſt is eaten by none but Holy and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Men, who are endowed with the Spirit of
Chriſt; but they ſay that the very Body of
Chriſt may be truly and indeed, or as they
expreſs it, <hi>really and ſubſtantially</hi> eaten, not
only by impious and unbelieving Men, but
which is abominable to be ſpoken, by <hi>Mice</hi>
and <hi>Dogs.</hi> 4. We pray ſo in our Churches,<note place="margin">2 Cor. XIV.</note>
that according to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Admonition, the
People may know what is prayed, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandingly
anſwer <hi>Amen</hi> to the common
Prayers: They like tinkling Braſs pour out
in the Church unknown and ſtrange Words,
without Underſtanding, Senſe, or Meaning;
and take all the care they can that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
may underſtand nothing. 5. And that
we may not mention all the differences, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are almoſt infinite, we have turned
the Holy Scriptures into all Languages, and
they will ſcarce allow them to be extant in
any Tongue: We invite the People to read
and hear the Word of God, they drive them
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:99001:93"/>
away from it: We deſire the Cauſe in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie
ſhould be underſtood by all, but
they fly from Judgment: We truſt to Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
they to Ignorance; We truſt to the
Light, and they to Darkneſs; We venerate,
as it is fit we ſhould, the Words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
and Prophets; they burn them. Laſtly,
in the Cauſe of God we deſire to ſtand or
fall by the Judgment of God alone; and
they would ſtand only by their own. Now
therefore if they would conſider all theſe
things with a ſedate and quiet mind, well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to hear and learn, they would not only
approve our deſign, who having left their
Errors, have applyed our ſelves to follow
Chriſt and his Apoſtles; but they would
likewiſe fall off from themſelves, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
unite with us in our way.</p>

theſe Laws upon us, or from whence
had they this Edict? That King acted very
ridiculouſly, who when he was aſſured by an

the Great Heathen God, referred the thing
again to <hi>Apollo,</hi> that he might ſee whether

if when we have heard God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſpeaking to us in the Scriptures, and
thereby know his Will and Pleaſure, as if all
this were nothing, we ſhould after all refer
the thing to a <hi>Council,</hi> which is nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than to try whether God and Man are
both of one mind; and whether Men will
pleaſe to approve and enforce the Laws of
God by their Authority. For what, ſhall
not truth be truth, except a Council is pleaſed
to will and require it? Or ſhall not God be
God without their conſent? If Chriſt at the
beginning would have acted thus, and would
neither have taught nor ſpoken any thing
without the conſent of the High Prieſts, and
if he had referred his whole Doctrine to <hi>Annas</hi>

been now? Or who had ever heard of the

               <p>3. WE do not deſpiſe Councils, nor the
Meetings and Conſultations of Biſhops and
learned Men; nor have we done what we
have done without Biſhops and a Council;
the thing was debated along time in a
full Aſſembly of the States.<note place="margin">In the fourth year of <hi>Pius</hi> the IV. <hi>Anno Chriſti</hi> 1563. in the ſixth year of the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> was an end put to the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which is ſo often mentioned by this Author.</note>
But what we may expect from
that Council which is now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be held by Pope <hi>Pius</hi>
the IV. in which men are with
ſuch facility condemn'd, uncall'd,
unheard, and unſeen, is not
mighty difficult to conjecture.
When <hi>Nazianzen</hi> in his times,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Nazian.</hi> ad Procopium.</note> ſaw men in
theſe Meetings ſo blind and obſtinate, that
they were wholly lead by their Affections,
and that they ſought Victory more than
Truth, he confidently ſaid, <hi>that he never ſaw
a good end put to any of the Councils.</hi> What
would he now ſay if he were living and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
their Tranſactions? for then, altho
there was ſome Faction and Partiality, yet
Cauſes were heard and conſidered, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
apparent Errors were taken away by
their united Suffrages. But our Adverſaries
will not ſo much as ſuffer the Cauſe to be
freely debated, nor will they ſuffer any
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:99001:94"/>
one of the many Errors that are crept
into the Church to be changed; for they are
wont frequently and impudently to boaſt
that their Church cannot Err, that there is
not the leaſt fault in it, that nothing was to
be yielded to us, or that if any thing were
granted, it was to be at the Diſcretion of the
Biſhops and Abbots; that they were the ſole
Moderators of Affairs, and that they were
the Church of God. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, that
Baſtards cannot make a Civil Society or
State, and they may conſider whether they
be any better qualified for the making of a
Church of God; for certainly they are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lawful Abbots, nor genuine Biſhops.
But ſuppoſe they are the Church, ſuppoſe
they are to be heard in Councils, and that
they have the ſole Right of Voting, yet in
ancient time, when the Church of God was
well governed, eſpecially if it be compared
with their Church; as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> acquaints
us, the Presbyters and Deacons, and ſome
part alſo of the Laity, were then call'd to
aſſiſt at the hearing of Eccleſiaſtical Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <p>4. BUT what now, if thoſe Abbots and
Biſhops know nothing? What if they know
not what Religion is, nor what they ought
to believe of God? What if the Law hath pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
from the Prieſts, and Counſel from
the Elders? What if, as <hi>Micah</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Micah. 3. 6.</note> the
Night be unto them inſtead of a Viſion,
and Darkneſs inſtead of a Divination?
What if,<note place="margin">I. VI. 10.</note> as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>the Watchmen of the
City are all blind, they are all ignorant?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 5. 13.</note> and

for they defer all to the Pope, who cannot
err, but then this in the firſt
place is ridiculous,<note place="margin">It was a common Proverb in the time of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> that the Holy Ghoſt was ſent from <hi>Rome</hi> to the Council in a Cloak-Bag, which was ſpoken in deriſion of the Councils de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending too much upon the Directions ſent them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry frequently from thence by Carriers, as Father <hi>Paul</hi> acquaints us in his Hiſtory of that Council; and to this Proverb our Author in this place alludes: The ſame Proverb is mentioned by the Biſhop of <hi>Quinque Eccleſiae;</hi> in a Leter print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the end of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent</hi> in <hi>Engliſh.</hi>

our Cauſe from ſo many Biſhops and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots,
to the Judgment of any one man, and
above all others, to the Judgment of the
Pope, who is accuſed by us of many very
great Crimes; and though he hath not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
for his own Miſdemeanors, yet hath
preſum'd to condemn us before we were
call'd, and that without any Tryal. Now do
we invent all this? or is it not now the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of our late Councils? Are not all things
referr'd to the Pope by the Council; ſo that
as if nothing were done by ſo many Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Subſcriptions, he alone may add,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:99001:95"/>
diminiſh, abrogate, approve, relax, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
whatſoever he pleaſe? Whoſe Words
are theſe? Why did the Biſhops and Abbots in
the end of the late Council at <hi>Trent,</hi> put in
theſe words as a part of their Decree:<note place="margin">De electione &amp; electi poteſtate. ca. ſignifica.</note> 
                  <hi>Saving
in in all things the Authority of the Apoſtolical

of himſelf: as if (ſaith he) <hi>any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
could preſcribe a Law to the Church of</hi> Rome,
<hi>when all Councils are held by the Authority of the
Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and derive their Force from it
too, and whereas they do patiently in their Decrees
except the Authority of the Pope of</hi> Rome? If
they will confirm and approve theſe things,
why are Councils call'd? but if they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
repeal'd and abrogated, why are they
ſtill left in their Books, as if they were in force.</p>
               <p>5. WELL, but ſuppoſe in the next place,
that the Pope, tho one is above all Councils,
that is, that he is a part greater than the
whole, has more Power, yea, and more
Wiſdom too, than all his Party beſides; and
that in ſpite of St <hi>Jeroms</hi> Judgment, <hi>the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of this one City,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ad Evagrium.</note> 
                  <hi>is greater than that of
the whole World.</hi> What if he has ſeen none of
theſe things, and has neither read the holy
Scriptures, nor the ancient Fathers, nor ſo
much as any of his own Councils? What if
like Pope <hi>Liberius</hi> of old, he becomes an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi>
or like Pope <hi>John,</hi> who lived not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
years ſince, thinks very leudly and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
of the <hi>Immortality of the Soul, and of the
Life to come;</hi> or as Pope <hi>Zoſimus,</hi> heretofore
corrupted the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> ſo he, for
the enlarging of his own Power, ſhould cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
the other Councils, and aver, that thoſe
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:99001:96"/>
things were deliberated and conſtituted by the
holy Fathers, in them which were never ſo
much as thought off; and that, as <hi>Camotenſis</hi>
ſaith, the Popes do frequently, he ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
Violence to the holy Scriptures, that he
may thereby poſſeſs himſelf of a <hi>Plenitude</hi> of
Power? What if he renounce the Chriſtian
Faith, and becomes an <hi>Apoſtate,</hi> as <hi>Lyranus</hi>
ſaith, many Popes have done? What, will
the holy Spirit for all theſe things knock at
the Cabbin of his Breaſt, and obtrude ſuch a
Light upon him, contrary to his Inclinations,
and againſt his Will, that he ſhall not err
though he would? Or ſhall ſuch a Pope as
this, be the Fountain of all Laws, and all the
Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge be
notwithſtanding found in him as in a Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net?
Or if theſe things be not in him, can
he nevertheleſs judge well and conveniently
of things of this great weight? Or if he be not
qualified to judge of them, does he yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
that all theſe things ſhould be refer'd to
him alone? What now, if the Popes Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates,
the Abbots and Biſhops diſſemble no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but declare themſelves openly to be
the Enemies of the Goſpel, and will not ſee
what they do ſee, but wreſt the Scriptures,
and knowingly and willingly deprave and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterate
the Word of God, and do foully

perſpicuouſly and properly ſpoken of Chriſt,
and cannot be applied to any other Mortal?

all,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hoſt. ca. quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Abas Panor. de elect. ca. Venerabilis.</note> or that he can do all thoſe things which
Chriſt can do; or that the Tribunal and

But are they ever like to be the Men which
are to reform the Church, who are at once
the Judges and the Criminals? Will they

they did; for they had taken care to exclude
all that were for the Reformation, and there
they ſate with a great Expectation ſix years;
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:99001:97"/>
in the firſt ſix months they decreed many
things concerning the Holy Trinity, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Son and Holy Ghoſt, which were pious,
but no way neceſſary for thoſe Times; and
yet of all theſe clear, manifeſt, confeſſed Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
which had gotten into the Church,
what one ſingle Error or Corruption have
they reformed? From what kind of Idolatry
have they reclaim'd the People? What Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
have they taken away? What part of
their Tyranny and Pomp have they abated
or diminiſhed? as if the World were ſo blind
that it could not ſee and obſerve that this is a
Conſpiracy rather than a Council, and that
all the Biſhops which the Pope have there
call'd together, are ſworn and addicted to his
Intereſt, and reſolved before hand, not to do
any thing but what ſhall pleaſe him, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
his Power, and which they ſee he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth;
or that Votes there are not numbred
rather than conſidered and weighed; or that
the wiſer and better part of the Council, is
not often overborn by the greater, but worſe
part of it. And therefore we know perfectly
well, that many good Men and Catholick
Biſhops, when ſuch Councils were indicted,
and they ſaw clearly that Parties and Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were ſerved by them, and that they
ſhould loſe their Pains, and harden the
Minds of their Adverſaries by their Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

Adverſaries, yet if they had come,
they ſhould have been freely heard in the

               <p>8. BUT now no man need wonder,
when none of us are permitted, not only not
to ſit, but not ſo much as to be ſeen in their
Council, ſo far are we from being freely
heard, when the Popes, Legats, and all the
Patriarchs, Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops and Abbots
are in a Conſpiracy, and united by their
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:99001:98"/>
common Crimes, all ſworn in the ſame Oath,
only ſit, and have alone the Power of voting:
and as if all this were not enough, have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
all their Judgments to the Will and
Humour of the Pope alone: That he who
ought to anſwer for his own Faults, ſhall give
Sentence in his own Cauſe upon himſelf,
when that ancient Chriſtian Liberty, which
it is abſolutely neceſſary ſhould be very great
in Councils, is totally taken away. (I ſay)
after all this, wiſe and good Men ought not
to wonder, if we do now, that which they
have ſeen done before in the like caſe, by ſo
many Fathers and Catholick Biſhops: That
is, that ſeeing we cannot be heard in the
Council, and that the Ambaſſadors of Princes
are had in Contempt and Scorn there; and
that as if the thing were already determined
and agreed, we are condemned before we
are heard: if after all this we had rather ſit at
home and commit the buſineſs to God, than
to go thither, where we ſhall have no place
nor effect any thing. But tho we can pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
and quietly bear our own Injuries; yet
why ſhould they ſhut Chriſtian and Pious
Princes out of their Councils? Why do they
ſo rudely and inſolently put <hi>them</hi> out, and
not ſuffer them to hear the buſineſs of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
debated; or to underſtand the State of
their own Churches, as if they were not Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
or could not judge well of it; or if
theſe Princes interpoſe their Authority, and
do that which they may, are commanded,
and ought to do, and which we know <hi>David</hi>
and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and other good Princes have
done; that is, if they reſtrain the Luxury of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:99001:99"/>
the Prieſts, and compel them to do their
duty, and keep them to it. If they pluck
down Idols, extirpate Superſtitions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
the Worſhip of God to its ancient Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
Why do they preſently make an <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry,</hi>
that theſe Princes diſturb all things, break
in upon other Mens Offices, and do act ill
things and immodeſtly? What Scripture (I
pray) hath excluded Chriſtian Princes from
hearing theſe Cauſes? Who beſides theſe Men
ever decreed any ſuch Laws? But they will
reply, that Civil Princes have learned to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
their States, and to manage Arms, but
they underſtand nothing of the Myſteries of
Religion. And now, what is the Pope at
this day, but a Monarch or Prince, and what
are the Cardinals (who are now ſcarcely
ſuffered to be any other but) the Children of
Kings and Princes? What are the Patriarchs,
and for the moſt part the Arch-biſhops, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops

and unjuſt thing and not to be born by

who are no better than blind men placed in
a Watch-tower; and that in the interim a
Chriſtan and a Catholick Prince ſhould ſtand
like a trunk or a ſtock, and without vote, and
without giving his judgment, only obſerve
what they are pleaſed to command and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
upon him, and as if he had neither Ears,

to receive without Exception, and with a
blind-fold ſubmiſſion, do whatever they are
pleaſed to command him, altho they are
Blaſphemous and wicked things, yea, altho
they ſhould command him to extinguiſh all
Religion, and to cruciſie his Saviour: For
why? Can <hi>Caiphas</hi> and <hi>Annas</hi> judge well of
Matters of Religion, and cannot <hi>David</hi> and
<hi>Ezechias?</hi> Is it lawful for a <hi>Cardinal,</hi> a Martial,

is it unlawful for an Emperour and a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Prince? For we attribute nothing more
to our Princes, than what is allowed them by
the Word of God, and approved by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples

that, the care of both Tables is committed

by God to a Faithful Prince, that he may
thereby underſtand, that not only the Civil

Emperors and Kings do it now. There were
no need to proſecute ſo plain and apparent a
point as this is, but that we have to do with
a <hi>parcel</hi> of Men who uſe to deny the cleareſt
things, oven thoſe things which lye plain and
open before their Eyes, out of a contentious
Diſpoſition and a deſire of Victory. The
Emperour <hi>Juſtinianus</hi> made a Law for the
correcting the Manner, and curbing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence
of the Clergy, and altho he was a

Succeſſors of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and Vicars of Jeſus

               <p>13. AND now ſeeing that Princes have
imployed their Authority upon Biſhops, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
commands from God concerning Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
brought back the Ark of God, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
Sacred Hymns and Pſalms, governed
the Prieſts, made publick Diſcourſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Worſhip of God, purged the
Temple, demoliſhed High Places, burnt Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
Groves, and have admoniſhed the
Prieſts concerning their Office, and given
them Laws of Living, have ſlain wicked Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
depoſed Biſhops, called Councils of
Biſhops, and ſate with them, and taught them
what they ſhould do, have puniſhed Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Biſhops, have taken cognizance of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:99001:102"/>
ſubſcribed Councils, and given Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
in them, and done all this, not by the
command of another, but in their own
Names, and that rightly and piouſly; ſhall
we ſay after all this, that the care of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
belongs not to them? Or that a Chriſtian
Prince, who is pleaſed to concern himſelf in
theſe things acts ill, immodeſtly and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?
In all theſe Affairs the moſt Ancient and
moſt Chriſtian Kings and Emperors have
intermeddled, and yet were never accuſed
of Impiety or Immodeſty for ſo doing; and
will any pretend to find either more Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Princes, or more Illuſtrious Examples.</p>
               <p>14. BUT now if they might do all theſe
things, tho they were only Civil Princes, and
governed their ſeveral States? Wherein have
our Princes offended, who tho they are in
the ſame Authority, may (it ſeems) not do
the ſame things? Or wherein conſiſts the
wonderful force of their Learning, Wiſdom,
and Holineſs, that contrary to the Cuſtom of
all the Ancient and Catholick Biſhops, who
have heretofore deliberated with Princes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Religion; <hi>they</hi> ſhould now reject and
exclude Chriſtian Princes from the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
of the Cauſe now depending, and from
all Participation and Congreſs with them in
their Councils? But yet it cannot be denied
they have taken a prudent care for themſelves
and the upholding their Kingdom, which
they foreſaw otherwiſe would ſoon have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed.
For if they who are placed by God
in the higheſt Station, had once ſeen and
underſtood theſe Mens Arts, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of Chriſt are contemned by them,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:99001:103"/>
that the light of the Goſpel is obſcured and
extinguiſhed by them; that they play tricks
with, and delude them, and ſhut up againſt
them the entrance into the Kingdom of
God: They would never ſo patiently have
ſuffered themſelves to be ſo proudly deſpiſed,
and injuriouſly ſcorned and abuſed. But
now on the other hand, they have rendred
all Princes obnoxious and ſubject to them by
their blindneſs and Ignorance.</p>
               <p>15. WE (as I ſaid before) have done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

or raſhly; nothing but with great

thought of doing it, except the Will of God
undoubtedly and manifeſtly opened to us in
the moſt Sacred Scriptures, and the neceſſity
of our Salvation had compelled us ſo to do;
for altho we have departed from that Church
which they call the Catholick Church, and
thereupon they have kindled a great envy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us in them, who cannot well judge of us
yet it is enough for us, and ought to be ſo to
any prudent and pious man, who conſiders
ſeriously of his Salvation, that we have only
departed from that Church which may enr,
which Chriſt who cannot err, ſo long ſince
foretold ſhould err, and which we ſee clearly
with our Eyes has departed from the Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
the Apoſtles, Chriſt himſelf, and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
and Catholick Church. And we have
approached as much as poſſibly we could, to
the Church of the Apoſtles, and ancient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Biſhops and Fathers, which we know
was yet a Perfect, and as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, <hi>an
unſpotted Virgin,</hi> and not contaminated with any
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:99001:103"/>
Idolatry or great and publick Error. Neither
have we only reformed the Doctrine of our
Church, and made it like theirs in all things,
but we have alſo brought the Celebration of☞
the Sacraments, and the Forms of our Publick
Rites and Prayers to an exact reſemblance
with their Inſtitutions or Cuſtoms. And ſo
we have only done that which we know
Chriſt himſelf and all pious and good Men
have in all Ages ever done; for we have
brought back Religion, which was foully neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
and depraved by them, to her Original
and firſt State; for we conſidered that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of Religion was to be made by
that which was the firſt Pattern of it: For
this Rule will ever hold good againſt all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,
ſaith the moſt ancient Father <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
That that is true which is firſt, and that is
adulterated and corrupted which is later. Irenaeus</hi>
doth often appeal to the moſt ancient
Churches who were the neareſt to Chriſt,
and which therefore were not at all likely to
have erred. And why is not that courſe
now taken alſo? Why do we not return to a
Conformity with the moſt Ancient Churches?
why cannot that be now heard amongſt us,
which was pronounced in the Council of
<hi>Nice,</hi> without the leaſt contradiction or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
from ſo many Biſhops and Catholick
Fathers; <gap reason="foreign">

a moſt beautiful Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> which was

               <p>16. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that he might reform the
Abuſes of the Lords Supper, which the
<hi>Corinthians</hi> began even then to corrupt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to them the Inſtitution of it by Chriſt

to you which I received of the Lord.</hi> And
Chriſt, that he might refute the Errors of

to the beginning. <hi>In the beginning</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>it was not ſo.</hi> And that he might ſhew the
Sordidneſs and Avarice of the Prieſts. This,
ſaith he, in the beginning, was a Houſe of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:99001:104"/>
Prayer, that Men might in it pray to God
Religiouſly and Purely; and ſo you ought
ſtill to have kept it, for it was not built to be
a <hi>Den of Thieves.</hi> So all religious and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Princes in Scripture, are eſpecially hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured
with this Commendation, that <hi>they
walked in the ways of</hi> David <hi>their Father;</hi> that
is, that they returned to the Original and
Fountain, and reſtored Religion to its firſt
Integrity. And ſo we ſeeing all things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
by them, and that there was nothing
left in the Church of God but miſerable Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines,
thought it was but reaſonable to ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us thoſe Churches for our Example,
which we were ſure had not erred, and had
neither private Maſſes, nor unintelligible and
barbarous Prayers, nor that Corruption of
the Holy Rites, or other Fooleries. And de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
to reſtore the Church of God to its
firſt Integrity [and Purity] we would not
ſeek any other Foundation to build upon, than
what was laid by the Apoſtles, that is, by
our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>17. WHEN therefore we had heard God
himſelf ſpeaking to us in his word, and had
ſeen and conſidered the illuſtrious Examples
of the Ancient and Primitive Church, and
that the expectation of a <hi>General Council</hi> was
very uncertain, and the event that would
follow it much more uncertain; and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when we had the utmoſt certainty what
was the Will of God, and therefore thought
it a Sin to be too ſollicitous and anxious what
the opinion of Men might be: After all this I
ſay we could no longer deliberate <hi>with fleſh
and blood;</hi> but proceeded and have according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:99001:105"/>
done that which may both lawfully be
done, and which hath already been often
done, by many pious Men and Catholick
Biſhops, that is, to take care of our own
Church in a Provincial Synod. For ſo we
ſee the ancient Fathers ever took that courſe,
before they came to a General and Publick
Council of the whole World; and there are
ſtill extant the Canons made in Muncipial
or Provincial Councils at <hi>Carthage</hi> under
St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> at <hi>Ancyra, Neocaeſarea,</hi> and at
<hi>Gangra</hi> alſo in <hi>Paphlagonia;</hi> all which, as ſome
think, were held before the name of the
<hi>Nicene</hi> General Council was thought of. And
in this manner without any General Council
by a private diſpute they of old oppoſed the
<hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Donatiſts.</hi> So when <hi>Conſtantius</hi>
the Emperor openly favored <hi>Auxentius</hi> a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of the <hi>Arrian</hi> Party, <hi>Athanaſius</hi> a moſt
Chriſtan Biſhop did not appeal to a General
Council, in which he ſaw nothing could be
done, by reaſon of the Power of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
and the great partiality and ſtiffneſs of
the Faction; but to his own Clergy and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that is to a Provincial Council.</p>
               <p>18. SO it was decreed in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
that twice in the year, and in a <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genian</hi>
Council, that at leaſt once in a year
Meetings of the Biſhops ſhould be celebrated
in every Province, which the Council of
<hi>Chalcedon</hi> ſaith was done, that <hi>if any Errors or
Abuſes aroſe any where, they might preſently and
upon the ſpot be extinguiſhed.</hi> And ſo when
<hi>Secundus</hi> and <hi>Paladius</hi> rejected the Council of
<hi>Aquileja,</hi> becauſe it was not a Publick and
General Council, St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Milan</hi>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:99001:105"/>
replied, that <hi>it ought not to ſeem new or ſtrange,
if the Biſhops of the</hi> Weſt <hi>aſſembled in Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>vincial
Conventions or Synods; for it had been not ſeldom
done by the</hi> Weſtern <hi>Biſhops before, and was very
frequently by the Greek Biſhops.</hi> So <hi>Charles</hi> the
Great, Emperor of <hi>Germany,</hi> held a Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Council in <hi>Germany,</hi> for the taking away
Images out of the Church againſt the ſecond
<hi>Nicene</hi> Council, which had determined for
them; nor is this thing new and unheard of
in <hi>England,</hi> for we have heretofore had many
Provincial Synods, and have governed our
Church by our own domeſtick Laws, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Interpoſition of the Popes of</hi> Rome, <hi>or any
other foreign Biſhops or Churches.</hi> What need
is there of many words? Certainly thoſe
greateſt and fulleſt Councils, of which theſe
Men ſo often Glory, if they be compared
with all the Churches which throughout the
World own and confeſs the Name of Chriſt,
what I pray can they ſeem to be, more than
ſome Private Councils of the Biſhops, and a
ſort of Great Provincial Synods? For tho
perhaps <hi>Italy, France, Spain, England, Germany,
Denmark</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould meet: yet, <hi>Aſia,
Greece, Armenia, Perſia, Media, Meſopotamia,
Egypt, Aethiopia, India</hi> and <hi>Mauritania,</hi> in all
which places there are many Chriſtians and
Biſhops would yet be abſent: And how could
ſuch a Council as this ever be reputed a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Council by any underſtanding Man?
And when ſo many and ſuch conſiderable
parts of the World are abſent, how can
they pretend to have the Conſent of the
whole World? Or what kind of Council was
the laſt at <hi>Trent,</hi> or how could it in any ſenſe
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:99001:106"/>
be ſaid to be General, when only Forty Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
met there, out of all the Chriſtian
Kingdoms in <hi>Europe;</hi> and ſome of them too
were ſo very Eloquent, that it had been fit
to ſend them to the Grammar Schools again;
and ſo Learned, that they had never in all
their Lives read the Bible over. But be
theſe things as they will, the truth of the
Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt doth not depend upon
General Councils,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 3.</note> or as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, upon
<hi>Mans Iudgment.</hi> But if they who ought to
take care of the Church will not underſtand,
and will be wanting to their duty, and
will harden their hearts againſt God and
againſt his Chriſt, and ſtill go on to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the direct and ſtreight ways of the
Lord, God will make the ſtones to cry out,
and endow Infants with an Oratorical Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
that there may ever be ſome to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute

                  <hi>There be many Devices in Mans heart</hi>

18. VERY elegant, and to our times,
moſt ſeaſonable are the Words of St. <hi>Jerome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Prophet. <hi>Nahum. cap.</hi> 3.</note>
                  <hi>As often</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as the Devil lulls any a ſleep
with the ſweet Blandiſhments of his Sirens, the
the Holy Scriptures never fail to awaken them
with a</hi> Surge qui dormis,<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 14.</note> elevare, &amp; illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabit
te Chriſtus. <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt,
and ariſe from the Dead, and Chriſt ſhall give
thee Light. At the coming of Chriſt, and of the
Word of God, and of the Eccleſiaſtical Doctrine;
when the time of the Ruine of</hi> Nineve, <hi>that
beautiful Harlot is come; then ſhall the People
awake, which had before been lull'd a ſleep under
their former Teachers, and ſhall paſs to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of the Scriptures; there ſhall they find the
Mountains of</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Joſhua <hi>the Son of</hi>
Nun; <hi>the Mountains of the Prophets, and the
Mountains of the New Teſtament, the Apoſtles
and Evangeliſts; and when the People have fled
to theſe Mountains, and are exerciſed in the reading
of them, tho they find no Teacher</hi> (for the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſt
ſhall be great, and the Labourers few)
<hi>yet the Induſtry of the People ſhall be approved, in
that they have fled to theſe Mountains, and the
Negligence of their Teachers ſhall be reprehended.</hi>
Thus hath St. <hi>Jerome</hi> written ſo very plainly,
that here is no need of an Interpreter; and
with ſo great a Congruity to the Events
which have happened in our Times, that it
looks as if he had deſigned to foretel and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
to us, with a Prophetick Spirit, the
whole State of our Times, the Ruine of that
richly adorned <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Harlot, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of the Church of God, the Blindneſs
and Negligence of the Biſhops, and the Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity
and Zeal of the People. For who can
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:99001:107"/>
be ſo blind, as not to ſee that theſe were the
Maſters, who, as St. <hi>Jerome</hi> ſaith, led the
People into Error, and ſtupified them in it;
or that <hi>Rome,</hi> their <hi>Nineve,</hi> which was once
painted with the moſt lovely Colours, is not
now better known and leſs valued; or that
pious Men being now as it were awakned
out of a deep Sleep, have not betaken them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the Mountains of the Scriptures, the
Word of God, and the Light of the Goſpel,
without ever expecting the Councils of ſuch
Teachers as theſe?</p>
               <p>19. <hi>BUT without the Popes Conſent at leaſt</hi>
(ſome may think) <hi>theſe things ought not to have
been attempted, becauſe he is the Bond that unites
the Chriſt an Society; he is that one Prieſt whom
God means in</hi> Deuteronomy, <hi>from whom Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
was to be expected in all difficult Caſes, and
from whom the</hi> Judgment of Truth <hi>was to be
fetched; and if any man ſhould dare to diſobey
him, he was to be put to death in the ſight of his
Brethren; and whatſoever he doth, he can be
judged by no mortal Man, that as Chriſt reigns in
Heaven, ſo he rules on Earth; that be can do
whatever Chriſt or God himſelf can do; that his
Conſiſtory and Chriſts are one and the ſame; that
without him there is no Faith, no Hope, no Church;
that he who forſakes him, rejects his own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
For thus the Canoniſts the Flatterers of
the Pope, write not very modeſtly of him,
for they could ſcarce ſay more, and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
not greater things of Chriſt himſelf. As
for us, we have not forſaken the Pope for
any humane Pleaſure or worldly Profit,
and we wiſh paſſionately, he would behave
himſelf ſo, that there ſhould be no need of a
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:99001:107"/>
Departure from him; but ſo it was, except
we left him, there was no coming to Chriſt.
Nor will he now enter a League with us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any other terms than thoſe propoſed by
<hi>Nahaſh</hi> King of <hi>Ammon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 11. 2.</note> to the men of <hi>Jabeth-gilead,
that he may thruſt out all our right
Eyes;</hi> for he will deprive us of the Holy
Scriptures, the Goſpel of our Salvation, and
of all that Hope we have in Chriſt Jeſus,
for upon other Conditions no Peace with
him can be had.</p>
               <p>20. AND as to that which ſo many of
them accuſtom themſelves to extol ſo very
much, that the Pope only is St. <hi>Peters</hi> Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor,
as if upon that account, he always
carried the Holy Ghoſt in his Boſome, and
ſo could not err; it is an airy and a ſilly
Pretence. The Grace of God is promiſed to
pious Souls, and to thoſe that fear God, and
not affixed to Chairs and Succeſſions. <hi>Riches</hi>
(ſaith St. <hi>Jerome) may render one Biſhop more
powerful than another; but yet all Biſhops, what
ever they are, are the Succeſſors of the Apoſtles.</hi>
But if the Place and Inauguration be it they
ſo much rely on, both <hi>Manaſſes</hi> ſucceeded

<hi>becauſe</hi> Hercules <hi>made it his Buſineſs to rid the

ſomething to Succeſſions, doth the Pope only
ſucceed St. <hi>Peter?</hi> In what Thing? in what
Religion? in what Function? in what part
of his Life? What one thing ever had St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
like the Pope, or the Pope like St. <hi>Peter?</hi>
unleſs they will ſay, that when St. <hi>Peter</hi> was
at <hi>Rome</hi> he never taught the Goſpel, he never
fed the Flock; that he took away the Keys
of the Kingdom of Heaven, hid his Lords
Treaſure; that he only ſate in the <hi>Lateran,</hi>
and with his Finger, pointed out all the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Purgatory, and the ſeveral ſorts of
Pains there; preſently, and at his Pleaſure,
diſmiſſed ſome Souls for Money, and ſent
other miſerable Souls into Torture; that he
taught them the uſe of private Maſſes, which
might be mumbled over in every Corner;
that he muttered the ſacred Myſteries in a
low ſoft Voice, and in a ſtrange Language;
that he hanged up the Euchariſt or conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Bread in every Church, and enſhrined it
on every Altar, and carried it before him
whither-ever he went on an ambling Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
with Lights and Bells. That he conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Oyl, Wax, Wooll, Bells, Calices, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and Altars with his ſacred Breath: that
he ſold Jubilees, Graces, Immunities, Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancies,
Preventions, firſt Fruits, Palls, the
uſe of Palls, Bulls, Indulgencies and Pardons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that he call'd himſelf the Head of the Church
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:99001:108"/>
the High Prieſt, the Biſhop of Biſhops, and
the only moſt Holy; that he uſurp'd Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
over other Churches; that he exemped
himſelf from all Civil Power; that he made
Wars, ſet Diſcord amongſt Princes; that he
was carried upon the Shoulders of Noble
men in a gilded Chair, with a Crown full of
Labels or Taſſils, with a <hi>Perſian</hi> Gallantry;
adorned with a royal Scepter and a golden
Diadem glittering with Jewels. Did St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
heretofore do all theſe things at <hi>Rome,</hi> and
as it were from hand to hand deliver them
down to his Succeſſors? for all theſe fine
things are now done at <hi>Rome,</hi> and that in ſuch
manner, as if nothing elſe ought to be done.</p>
               <p>21. UNLESS perhaps they would be
better pleaſed with turning the Table, and
ſaying, that the Pope does all thoſe things
which we know heretofore St. <hi>Peter</hi> did; that
he travails into all Countries, preacheth the
Goſpel, not only publickly, but privately
from Houſe to Houſe; that he inſiſteth oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely
and inopportunely, in ſeaſon and out
of ſeaſon; that he doth the Work of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt,
and performs the Miniſtry of
Chriſt; that he is the Watch-man of the
Houſe of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> that he receives the Oracles
and Word of God, and delivers them, as he
received them, to the People; that he is the
Salt of the Earth, the Light of the World;
that he feeds not himſelf, but the Flock; that
he doth not intangle himſelf with the Civil Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of this Life; that he doth not exerciſe
Lordſhip and Dominion over the People of
the Lord; that he doth not ſo much ſeek to
have others miniſter to, and ſerve him, but
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:99001:109"/>
rather that he may ſerve and aſſiſt others;
that he thinks with St. <hi>Peter,</hi> that all Biſhops
are his Companions and Equals;<note place="margin">1 <hi>Peter.</hi> 5. 1. He ſtiles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <gap reason="foreign">

unleſs the Popes at this day do all theſe

               <p>22. THERE is much leſs cauſe for
them to complain ſo dreadfully as they do, of
our departure from them, and to recal us
back again to their Society and Faith. There
is a Story that one <hi>Cobilon</hi> a <hi>Lacedaemonian,</hi>
being ſent to make a League with the King
of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and ſinding by chance his Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crs
playing at Dice, he return'd forthwith,
without diſpatching or mentioning the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
he came about. Being examined upon
his return home why he had not executed the
publick Commiſſion they had given him, he
replied, that it ſeemed to him to be a great
Diſhonour to their Common-wealth, if he
had made an Alliance with a parcel of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.
Now, if we ſhould return to the Pope
and the Popiſh Errors, and make a League,
not only with Dicers, but with men infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
more debauch'd, it would not only bring
an ill Report upon our Fame and Reputation,
but would be pernicious and deſtructive to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:99001:109"/>
us, by incenſing the Wrath of God againſt
us, and burthening and waſting our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences;
for we have only left him, who
we ſaw had for many Ages blinded the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Earth, and departed from him,
who with too much Inſolence, uſeth to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that he cannot err, and that whatever
he doth, he cannot be judged by any mortal
man, no, not by Kings nor Emperors, nor
all the Clergy, nor all the People, tho he
ſhould carry a thouſand Souls with him to
Hell; from him who aſſum'd Dominion, not
only over Men, but over the Angels of God,
commanding them when he pleaſed to go
and come, and carry Souls to Purgatory,
and bring them back again as his Holineſs
thought fit. Whom <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great ſtil'd
plainly the Fore-runner and Harbinger of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,
and an Apoſtate from the Faith;
from whom thoſe<note n="*" place="margin">I ſuppoſe by this Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he means the ſeveral <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops who had been Proteſtants in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th. and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Papiſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>again in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> were aſhamed to take a third turn now in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and ſo not only ſliffly perſiſted now in Popery, but were more clamorous againſt the Reformation than others were. <hi>Heylin,</hi> his <hi>Eccleſia Reſtaurata, Anno primo Eliz. pag.</hi> 286.</note> Champions, who now ſo
vigorouſly oppoſed the Goſpel, and that
Truth they are very well ſatisfied of, have
every man of them heretofore fallen, and
would now again freely and willingly leave
him, if the Note and Shame of being thought
too too inconſtant, and their Credits with
the People did not hinder them from it.
Laſtly, we have departed from him, to whom
we were no way bound, and who hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to pretend for our Submiſſion to him;
but I know not what Genius of the Place and
the Succeſſion he poſſeſſeth.</p>

have had the greateſt reaſon to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
the Pope; for our Kings (even thoſe
who followed the Faith and Authority of
the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> with the utmoſt obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
and deference) a long time ſince, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
felt the weight of their Yoke, and
groan'd under the Tyranny of the Papal
Kingdom; for the <hi>Roman Biſhops</hi> pluckt the
Diadem from off the Head of our <hi>Henry</hi> the
2d.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Henry</hi> the 2d.</note> and compell'd him to wait upon their
<hi>Legate</hi> in a private Habit, without any of the
Inſigns of Majeſty that he might be expoſed to
the Contempt of all his Subjects. And another
Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> armed againſt King <hi>John,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John.</note>
another of our Princes, the Biſhops and
Monks, and ſome part of the Nobility, and
abſolved all his Subjects from that Oath of
Allegiance they had taken to him, and at
laſt, by the higheſt Impiety, not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
him of his Kingdom, but his Life;
and they wounded <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. a moſt
noble Prince, with their Curſes and Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications,
and ſtir'd up againſt him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the <hi>Emperor,</hi> and ſometimes the King
of <hi>France,</hi> and as much as in them lay, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
our Kingdom to be a Prey and a
Booty to them; like a company of ſilly men
as they were, to think ſo great a Prince
would be frighted with Vizors and Rattles,
or that ſo great a Kingdom could be devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at one mouthful; and as if all this had not
been enough, they would needs make <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
a tributary Province, and yearly, moſt
unjuſtly exacted a conſiderable Revenue out of
it; ſo much has the Friendſhip of the City
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:99001:110"/>
of <hi>Rome</hi> coſt us. Now if they extorted theſe
great Advantages from us by Impoſtures and
ill Arts, there is no reaſon why we ſhould
not by good Methods and Laws recover them
back again: but if on the other ſide, our
Kings induced by an Opinion of their ſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
Holineſs, in the darkneſs of thoſe times
freely beſtowed theſe things on them, upon
the account of Religion, there is now very
good reaſon that our latter Kings, having
diſcovered the Error of their Anceſtors,
ſhould take them away again, they being
poſſeſs'd of the ſame Power with the former
Kings; for every Donation becomes void,
when it is no longer approved by the Will of
the Giver; but it can never ſeem a Will,
which is clouded and impeded by Error.</p>

               <p>THUS I have acquainted thee, my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that it is no new or ſtrange thing
to ſee the Chriſtian Religion in theſe days up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
its Reſtitution and Revival in the World,
entertain'd with Slanders and Reproaches,
for the ſame things happened to Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and his Apoſtles. And yet, leaſt thou
ſhouldeſt be miſled and impoſed upon by
theſe Clamors of our Adverſaries, we have
repreſented to thee what the whole manner
of our Religion is; what we believe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God the Father, concerning his only Son
Jeſus Chriſt, and concerning the Holy
Ghoſt; what our Opinion is concerning the

Holy Scriptures, the Ceremonies of the
Church, and all the other parts of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

we deteſt, as pernicious to the Souls of Men,
and plagues, all thoſe Ancient Hereſies that
have been condemn'd by the old Councils

into practiſe again, as much as we can poſſib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, which our

we puniſh all Licentious Courſes of Life, and

That we have departed from that Church
which they had made a Den of Thieves, in
which they had left nothing ſound or like a

to have erred in many things, as <hi>Lot</hi> left

Riſe of the Church, as to the proper Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
               <p>2. THAT we have not indeed expected
the Authority or conſent of the Council of
<hi>Trent,</hi> in which we ſaw nothing was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd
well and regularly, where all that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:99001:111"/>

Ambition openly carried all things, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Practice of the Holy Fathers,
and the Cuſtoms of our own Anceſtors, we
have reformed our Churches in a Provincial
Synod, and according to our Duty, we have
caſt off the Yoke and Tyranny of the Biſhop
of <hi>Rome,</hi> who had no juſt Authority over us,
nor was like either Chriſt or St. <hi>Peter,</hi> or the
Apoſtles, or indeed, like a Biſhop in any
thing. Laſtly,<note place="margin">This Apology was pen'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Schiſm in in the Church of <hi>England</hi> broke out. As <hi>Fuller</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, they firſt began to appear in 1563. which was the year after this Apology was written, but it came not to an open Rupture till the year 1570. <hi>Fuller.</hi>
                  </note> we do all agree amongſt ourſelves
in all the Doctrines and Points of the
Chriſtian Religion, and do with one Spirit
and one Mouth worſhip God, the Father of
our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>3. WHEREFORE, O Chriſtian and
Pious Reader, now thou feeſt the Reaſons
and Cauſes of the Reformation of Religion
with us, and of our Departure from them,
thou oughteſt not to wonder that we ſhould
rather chooſe to obey our Saviour than Men.
St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath admoniſhed us, that we ſhould
not be <hi>carried away with every Wind of falſe
Doctrine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 16. 17. 18.</note> and eſpecially, that we ſhould <hi>mark
them which cauſe diviſions and offences contrary to
the Doctrine which we have learned, and avoid
them; for they that are ſuch, ſerve not our Lord
Jeſus Chriſt, but their own Belly, and by good
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:99001:112"/>
Words and fair Speeches deceive the Hearts of the
ſimple.</hi> Their Impoſtures accordingly, like
Batts and Owls, do now ſometime ſince
begin to flie and ſteal away before the <hi>riſing
Sun,</hi> and cannot indure the Light of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel;
and altho they were in ſome ſenſe built
and heaped almoſt up to Heaven, yet they
ſink down into Ruins of their own accord.
For thou oughteſt not to think that thoſe
things happened accidentally or by chance.
It was certainly the Will of God, that in
theſe times the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt ſhould,
in defiance of all oppoſition, be ſpread
abroad in the World; and therefore men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
moved by the Word of God, freely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
themſelves to the Doctrine of Chriſt;
and as for us, we ſought neither Riches nor
Pleaſure, nor caſe by this Change; for our
Adverſaries abound in all theſe, and we had
a much larger Share of them whilſt we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
with them.</p>
               <p>4. NOR do we decline Concord and
Peace with Men neither, but yet we will not
continue in a State of War God, that we
might have Peace with Men. <hi>The Name of
Peace</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Hilary) is Pleaſant, but then
Peace and Servitude are not the ſame thing; for</hi>
(if according to their deſire) <hi>the Name of Chriſt
ſhould be ſuppreſt, the Truth of the Goſpel betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
their wicked Errors be diſſembled, the Eyes of
Chriſtian Men be deluded, and a plain and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
Conſpiracy be carried on againſt God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
this is not</hi> (ſaith that great Man) <hi>Peace,
but the conditions of a moſt baſe Slavery.</hi> There
is, ſaith <hi>Nazianzen, an unprofitable Peace, and
there is an uſeful ſort of Diſcord;</hi> for we muſt
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:99001:112"/>
purſue Peace with Conditions, <hi>as far as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
lawful, and in us lyeth;</hi> and unleſs theſe Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
may attend it, Chriſt himſelf came
not to bring Peace into the World, but a
Sword.</p>
               <p>5. WHEREFORE, if the Pope does
indeed deſire we ſhould be reconciled to
him, he ought firſt to reconcile himſelf
to God; for as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith,
<hi>Schiſms ariſe from hence, that the Head is not
ſought, and a Return is not made to the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the Holy Scriptures, and the Precepts of
our Heavenly Maſter are not kept, for elſe
it is not Peace</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but War; neither can
any man be united to the Church, who is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from the Goſpel.</hi> But theſe men,
(with whom we are concern'd) do uſe to
make a baſe gain by the Name of Peace,
for the Peace they ſeek, is only a Peace
of <hi>idle Bellies;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 12.</note> for all theſe Controverſies
betwixt us and them might with great
facility be ended, if Ambition, Gluttony
and Luxury did not hinder it; and from
hence proceed all their Tears; their Souls are
in their Diſhes, and all their loud Clamors
and Noiſe, are only that they may baſely
and wickedly keep what they have acquired
knaviſhly.</p>
               <p>6. IN theſe times the <hi>Pardoners, Data<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
Collectors</hi> and <hi>Pimps</hi> of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>
make the greateſt Complaints againſt us,
who with others of their Trade, think
that <hi>great Gain is Godlineſs, and ſerve not our
Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their own Bellies;</hi> for
in the foregoing Ages, this ſort of men
had a very profitable imployment; but now,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:99001:113"/>
whatever is gain'd to Chriſt, turns as they
think, to their Loſs. Yea, <hi>his Holineſs</hi> too
complains ſadly that Piety is grown cold,
and his Revenue is become much ſmaller than
heretofore it was; and therefore <hi>the good man</hi>
does his utmoſt to make us hated, loads us
with Reproaches, and condemns us for He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
(without any mercy) that they who
know not the real cauſe of all this, may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
be induced to believe us the very worſt
of men, and yet in the interim we are not
therefore aſhamed, nor indeed ought we to
be ſo, of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe
we eſteem the Glory of God more than the
good Opinion of Men. We know that all
we teach is true, and we cannot offer Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to our own Conſciences, or give Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
againſt God, for if we deny any part
of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt before Men, he
will in like manner deny us before his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and if there be any that will be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and cannot bear the Doctrine of Chriſt,
they are blind, and the Leaders of the Blind;
but the Truth is ſtill to be preached and
owned, and we muſt patiently expect the
Judgment of God.</p>
               <p>7. AND in the interim, our Adverſaries
ſhould do well to bethink themſelves ſeriouſly
of their own Salvation, and to put an end to
their Raging Hatred and Perſecution of the
Goſpel of the Son of God, that at laſt, they
may not find him the Vindicator and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger
of his own Cauſe; for God will not be
had in deriſion; and men too, now ſee what is
doing; that Flame, the more it is repreſs'd,
with ſo much the greater Violence doth it
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:99001:113"/>
break out again and diſplay it ſelf. Their
Infidelity and Unbelief ſhall never be able to
fruſtrate or put a ſtop to the Faith of God;
and if they ſhall ſtill perſiſt in the Hardneſs of
their Hearts, and refuce to receive the Goſpel
of Jeſus Chriſt.<note place="margin">Math. 21. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>The Publicans and the Harlots
ſhall go into the Kingdom of God before them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The God and Father of our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt open all their Eyes, that they may ſee
that bleſſed Hope to which they are called,
that we may altogether glorifie the only true
God, and Jeſus Chriſt, whom he hath ſent

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU are pleaſed to write to me
with much freedom, according to
the great Acquaintance which hath
been between us (ever ſince we
lived together at <hi>Padua,</hi> where you were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in the publick Service of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:99001:115"/>
and I in the Purſute of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
that both your ſelf, and many others
with you, in thoſe Parts, do much admire,
that ſeeing there is at this time a <hi>General
Council</hi> call'd by the Pope at <hi>Trent,</hi> for the
compoſing Controverſies in Religion, and
the extinguiſhing all Contentions that have
ariſen on that account; and that, whereas
all other Nations are aſſembled there, the
Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> alone, has neither ſent
any Ambaſſador thither, nor excuſed their
Abſence by <hi>Envoys</hi> or Letters; but in the
mean time, without the Conſent of the
Council, hath chang'd almoſt the whole
Order of their Ancient and Paternal Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
that one of theſe things hath the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of a proud Contumacy, and the
other of a pernicious Schiſm; for it is a great
Wickedneſs for any man (ſay you) to decline
the moſt holy Authority of the Pope of <hi>Rome;</hi>
or to to withdraw himſelf, when he is call'd
to a <hi>Council</hi> by him. And that Controverſies
in Religion ought not to be determined any
where but in ſuch Conventions, for there are
the Patriarchs and Biſhops, and the moſt
Learned of all Orders of Men in the Church;
at their Mouths the Truth is to be ſought,
there are the great Lights of the Church, and
there the Holy Ghoſt is ever preſent, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
pious Princes have in every age
referr'd all thoſe Doubts which have happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
concerning the Worſhip of God, to ſuch
publick Conſultations. That neither <hi>Moſes,</hi>
nor <hi>Joſhua,</hi> nor <hi>David,</hi> nor <hi>Ezechia,</hi> nor <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi>
nor any other of the Judges, Kings or
Prieſts, did ever deliberate of the Affairs of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:99001:115"/>
the Church any other way, than in a Council
of the Biſhops. That the Apoſtles of Chriſt
and the Holy Fathers held Councils; that
ſo the Truth was diſcovered, ſo Hereſies
were ſuppreſs'd, ſo <hi>Arrius,</hi> ſo <hi>Eunomius,</hi> ſo
<hi>Eutyches,</hi> ſo <hi>Macedonius,</hi> and ſo <hi>Pelagius</hi> were
overcome, and ſo at this time the Diſſentions
of the World may be compoſed, and the
Ruins of the Church repair'd, if Men would
be pleas'd to lay by their Animoſities and
Partiality, and come to this Council; but
without a Council it is utterly unlawful to
attempt any Change in Matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>2. THIS Sir, is almoſt the whole Sum of
your Letter, and as for me, I will not now
preſume to give you in Anſwer, on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of <hi>England,</hi> an exact Account of the
reaſon of all our publick Tranſactions; nor
do I think it is your Will or Expectation that
I ſhould; the Counſels of Kings are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd
and ſecret, and ſo they ought to be,
and this you Sir know perfectly well, that
they are not to be reveal'd at random to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
body, or any body; and yet in compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with that old and intimate Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
that has been between us (becauſe I ſee
you ſo earneſtly deſire it) I will ſhortly and
friendly tell you what my Judgment is; but
as (another ſaith) as far as I know and may,
which I doubt not, will give you an intire
Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>3. WE wonder (ſay you) that no Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors
from <hi>England</hi> are come to the <hi>Council.</hi>
I beſeech you Sir, are the <hi>Engliſh</hi> the only
Nation who have not come to the Council?
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:99001:116"/>
Have you Sir been at the Council your ſelf?
Have you taken an exact Account? Have
you told them exactly by Poll? Did you
Sir, ſee there all the other Nations come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
from all Parts of the World, except
the <hi>Engliſh?</hi> But Sir, if you are ſo mightily
in love with <hi>Wondering,</hi> why did you not
admire this too, that neither any one of the
three great Patriarchs of <hi>Conſtantinople, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och,</hi>
nor <hi>Alexandria,</hi> nor <hi>Presbyter John,</hi> nor
the <hi>Grecians, Armenians, Medes, Perſians, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians;</hi>
thoſe of <hi>Barbary, Ethiopia,</hi> or the
<hi>Indies,</hi> did not come to the Council too? for
is there not many in thoſe Nations who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in Chriſt? have they not Biſhops? are
they not by Name, and in reality Chriſtians?
And Sir, did Ambaſſadors come from all
theſe Nations to the Council? or will you
rather ſay the Pope did not call them, or
that they are not bound by your Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Sanctions?</p>
            <p>4. BUT Sir, we have much greater rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to wonder, that when the Pope hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand
condemn'd us, and publickly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
us excommunicated as Hereticks,
without ever hearing us make our Defence,
or alledging any thing againſt us, he ſhould
afterwards call us to the Council; for to
condemn and puniſh men firſt, and then to
call them to Judgment, is a very abſurd way
of Procedure, a meer <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>a Cart

be inform'd if the Popes Intentions be to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
with us concerning Religion in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
whom he has condemn'd for Hereticks,
as I ſaid, or if he intends we ſhall ſtand at
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:99001:116"/>
the Bar, and be obliged forthwith to change
our Minds, or be immediately condemn'd
again? one of theſe things is new or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Example, and ſtiffly denied to thoſe of
our Perſwaſion, by Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the third;
and the other is ridiculous, if he thinks the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> ſo ſilly, as to come to the Council for
no other purpoſe but to be accuſed, and
make their Defence as well as they can, and
before his Holineſs eſpecially, who is long
ſince accuſed himſelf, not only by us, but
by his own party, of many great Crimes.</p>
            <p>5. BUT Sir, if <hi>England</hi> only ſeems ſo
ſtubborn to you, where are the Ambaſſadors
of the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> the Princes of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
and the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> of the <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers,</hi>
of the <hi>Griſons,</hi> of the <hi>Hanſe Towns</hi> of
the Realm of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and of the Dukedom
of <hi>Pruſſia?</hi> and now when ſo many of the
Chriſtian Nations are abſent from your
Council, it is a moſt fooliſh thing to ſpeak of
none but the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> but why do I ſpeak of
them? the Pope himſelf will not vouchſafe
to come to his own Council; and did you
not wonder at this too? for what Inſolence
is this, for any one man at his Pleaſure,
when he will, to call together all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Kings, Princes and Biſhops, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
them to yield Obedience to him in it,
and in the mean time, not meet them there
himſelf? Sure I am, when the Apoſtles
call'd a Council at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> the
Apoſtle of whoſe Chair and Succeſſion the
Popes glory ſo infinitely, would not be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
But I ſuppoſe the Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the 4th.
who now ſits in that Chair, remembers very
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:99001:117"/>
well what betided <hi>John</hi> XXII. that he had no
good Fortune at his Appearance in the
Council of <hi>Conſtance;</hi> for he came thither a
<hi>Pope,</hi> but returned a <hi>Cardinal;</hi> and therefore
the Popes ever ſince have very wiſely taken
care of themſelves, and kept out of reach,
and at home, and have ſtoutly withſtood
all Councils and free Debates for above forty
years ſince; when Dr. <hi>Martin Luther</hi> was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted
with all manner of Curſes and Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolts
by the Pope, becauſe he had begun
to preach the Goſpel, and reform Religion
by the Word of God and with all Humility;
begged that his Cauſe might be reſerved to
the Hearing and Determination of a General
Council, he could not be heard; for <hi>Leo</hi> the
X. ſaw very well, if the thing had been
refer'd to a Council, that his own Concerns
would be brought in danger, and that he
might hear what he would not.</p>
            <p>6. THE Name of a <hi>General Council</hi>
ſounds well, if it be conven'd as it ought, and
Men would lay by their Paſſions, and refer
all things to the Word of God, ſubmitting to
the Truth only; but if Piety and Religion
are openly oppreſs'd, if Tyranny and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are confirm'd, if Factions, Gluttony and
Luxury are encouraged, there can then be
nothing thought of that is of worſe Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to the Church of God. And all this
I have ſaid upon a Suppoſition, that there
is ſuch a Council ſomewhere as you menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and yet I heartily believe there is none
at laſt; but if indeed there be any where any
Council at all, it muſt be a very obſcure pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Council; for tho we are at no very
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:99001:117"/>
great diſtance from the Place, yet we could
never hear what Biſhops were met, nor what
was done, nor indeed whether any Biſhops
at all would meet.<note place="margin">29th. of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bemb.</hi> 1560. So that this Letter was writ about <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1560.</note> And about twenty
months ſince, when this Council was firſt
call'd by Pope <hi>Pius, Ferdinandus</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
made anſwer, that <hi>tho all other things were
agreeable, yet the Place the Pope had choſen did
very much diſpleaſe him, for that, tho</hi> Trent
<hi>was a fine City, yet it was not convenient for all
the Nations, and beſides, could not poſſibly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that great Number of Perſons who did uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
follow a general Council.</hi> And almoſt the
ſame Anſwer was generally given by all the
Chriſtian Princes, and ſome of them anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
much more ſharply; and therefore we
thought all theſe fine Shews, would, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Council, end in ſmoak.</p>
            <p>7. BUT I pray Sir, who call'd this
Council, and aſſembled the World together?
you will ſay <hi>Pope Pius</hi> the IV. and why he,
rather than the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Toledo?</hi> by
what Authority and Example of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church, and by what law hath he done
this? did <hi>Peter, Linus, Cletus</hi> or <hi>Clemens</hi>
thus put the World in commotion by their
Edicts? this, during the Integrity and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
of the Roman Empire, was a ſole Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
of the Emperor; but now that the
Power of the Empire is diminiſhed, and
that the ſeveral Kingdoms in Chriſtendom
have ſhared the Imperial Power amongſt
them, this Power is devolved to all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Kings and Princes. Now Sir, ſearch
all the Annals, and gather together all the
Memoirs of Antiquity, and you ſhall find
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:99001:118"/>
that all the ancient Councils, as thoſe of
<hi>Nice, Epheſus, Chalcedon, and Conſtantinople,</hi>
were call'd by the Emperors of <hi>Rome, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinus,
Theodoſius</hi> the Firſt and Second,
and <hi>Martianus,</hi> and not by the Popes of
<hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. POPE <hi>Leo,</hi> a Man ſufficiently kind to
himſelf, and who did not in any thing neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
the Authority of his See, did yet moſt
humbly ſupplicate <hi>Martian</hi> the Emperor, that
he would be pleas'd to call a Council in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
becauſe that Country did then ſeem moſt
convenient for that purpoſe; his Words are
theſe: <hi>All the Prieſts do moſt earneſtly beſeech
your Clemency, that You would be pleaſed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
a General Synod to be celebrated in</hi> Italy.
But this Emperor, that he might ſhew that
he had the Right of calling Councils, and
none but he; commanded the Council to
meet at <hi>Chalcedon</hi> in <hi>Bithynia,</hi> and not in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
where the Pope did moſt violently deſire
it ſhould have been held. And when <hi>Ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
in the Conteſt which he had with St. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi>
alledged a Synod, <hi>tell us</hi> (ſaid St. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome)
what Emperor commanded it to meet;</hi>
St. <hi>Jerome</hi> did not think a <hi>General Council</hi> of
any great Validity, except ſome of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
call'd it. Now I do not inquire what
Emperor commanded the Biſhops to meet
now at <hi>Trent;</hi> but only whether the Pope
(who takes ſo much upon him) hath conſulted
with the Emperor about holding this Council,
and what Chriſtian King or Prince has he
prae-acquainted with his Will? Now to break
in upon the Rights of another, and to aſſume
to a mans ſelf what belongs to another man
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:99001:118"/>
by Fraud or Force is injurious, and for him
to abuſe the Clemency of Princes, and to
command them as if they were his Servants,
is a ſuperlative and intolerable piece of Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and contumely, and it would be an equal
Injuſtice in us to confirm and allow that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
and Inſolence of his by our Compliance;
and therefore if we ſhould only reply, That
this Council of yours at <hi>Trent</hi> is not
lawfully call'd, and that nothing relating to
it has been rightly and orderly managed by
Pope <hi>Pius,</hi> no man can with any Juſtice
blame our Abſence.</p>
            <p>9. I ſhall not here trouble you with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
account of the Injuries our Nation hath
received from the Popes of <hi>Rome;</hi> that they
have ſnatch'd the Scepters out of the Hands,
and plucked the Diadems from off the Heads
of our Kings; that they pretend that this
Kingdom is theirs, that it is poſſeſs'd in their
Right, and that our Kings are their Benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries
of Homagers: Theſe are old Injuries;
but of late years, they have ſtir'd up at one
time the King of <hi>France,</hi> and at another the
Emperor; and what this Pope <hi>Pius</hi> has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted,
ſpoken, done, contrived and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
againſt us, need not be remembred here,
for his Words and Actions are not ſo cloſe
and ſecret, but they may be known, and his
Will thereby be diſcovered. And as to the
means by which he acquired the <hi>Popedom,</hi>
and the ſteps by which he climb'd to that
heighth of Dignity, I ſhall ſay nothing. I
do not ſay that he corrupted the <hi>Cardinals,</hi>
by purchaſing their Votes, and by Bargain
and Purchaſe, as by Mines and Ambuſhes
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:99001:119"/>
aſpired to the Popedom. I do no ſay nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that very lately, when he was not able
to pay the Cardinal <hi>Caraffa,</hi> by whoſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
he purchaſed the Votes of the other
Cardinals, and to whom, upon that Score,
he ow'd a very conſiderable Sum of Money,
he caſt the poor man into Priſon, and there
baſely murthered him. I leave theſe, and
ſuch other things as theſe are, rather to you,
who being nearer to them, muſt needs ſee
them more clearly, and underſtand them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than we do at this diſtance. And now
Sir, do you wonder that we ſhould not come
to this bloody man, this Purchaſer of Votes,
this Bankrupt, and this Simonaical Heretick?
It becomes not a wiſe man (believe me) to
throw himſelf into the Chair of Peſtilence,
and to conſult concerning Religion with the
Enemies of all Religion. <hi>My Mother</hi> (ſaid
one) <hi>commanded me not to approach to the Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous;</hi>
and St. <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle, durſt not
remain in the ſame Bath, and waſh himſelf
with one <hi>Cerinthius</hi> a Heretick, leſt he
ſhould periſh with him by a Thunder Clap
from Heaven. <hi>I have not ſat</hi> (ſaid <hi>David) in
the Council of the Wicked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither have I walked
with the Workers of Iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. WELL, but be it ſo, for this time let
it be granted, that the Right of calling
Councils belongs to the Pope, and that he
can (in this point) command the World;
and let whatever we have ſaid concerning
the Power of the Emperor, and the Right
of Kings be taken for falſe and vain, and let <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
be ſuppoſed too to be a good man; that he
was rightly and lawfully choſen Pope, that
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:99001:119"/>
he has not ſought the Life of any man, that
he has not murthered <hi>Caraffa</hi> in Priſon; yet
it is fit that Councils ſhould be free after all
this, and that who pleaſeth may be there,
who cannot conveniently, may on the other
ſide be abſent; this was the equity and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of better men: Princes then were
not treated with ſo much Violence and Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſo that if any perſon happened to ſtay
at Home, or did not ſend Ambaſſadors to
the Council, he ſhould preſently be noted
by the Eyes and Fingers of all men. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you Sir, what Obſerver kept count
who was abſent from the Councils of <hi>Nice,
Epheſus, Conſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon?</hi> but
there was in none of theſe any Ambaſſadors
from <hi>England, Scotland, Poland, Hungary,
Spain, Denmark,</hi> nor any part of <hi>Germany.</hi>
See, read and conſider the Subſcriptions, and
you will find what I ſay is true. And why
do you not rather wonder that the <hi>Britans</hi>
did not come to thoſe full, famous, celebrated
and frequented Councils? Or that the Popes
then were ſo wonderful patient, that they
did not preſently cenſure them for Contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy?
But this Papal tyranny was not then
grown up, it was then lawful for Pious Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
and the Holy Fathers, without any
Prejudice, to ſtay at Home. <hi>Paul</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
would not truſt himſelf to the Council
of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but appealed unto <hi>Caeſar;</hi> and
tho St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> the Biſhop was call'd to the
Council at <hi>Caeſarea</hi> by the Emperor, yet he
would not come; and he alſo, when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the <hi>Arrian</hi> Party the ſtrongeſt in the
Council of <hi>Syrmium,</hi> would not ſtay, but
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:99001:120"/>
preſently withdrew and went away; and
the Biſhops of the <hi>Weſt</hi> following his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
refuſed to come to that Council. St. <hi>John
Chryſoſtom</hi> did not come to an <hi>Arrian</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
tho he was invited both by Letters and
Meſſengers ſent by <hi>Arcadius</hi> the Emperor.
When the <hi>Arrian</hi> Biſhops in <hi>Paleſtine</hi> were
met together, and had the greateſt part of
the Votes on their ſide, <hi>Paphnutius</hi> an old
man, and <hi>Maximus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
out of the Convention and went
away. <hi>Cyrillus</hi> a Biſhop, appealed from the
Council of the <hi>Patropaſſians; Paulinus</hi> Biſhop
of <hi>Treves,</hi> would not come to the Council of
<hi>Millan,</hi> becauſe he ſaw, by reaſon of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and Power of <hi>Conſtantius</hi> the Emperor,
every thing plied under, and was over-rul'd
by <hi>Auxentius</hi> an <hi>Arrian</hi> Biſhop. The Biſhops
who came to the Council at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>
would not afterwards come to that which
was holden at <hi>Rome,</hi> to which they were
call'd alſo, which yet was no prejudice to
them, tho they were commanded to attend
there by Letters from the Emperor; it was
then thought a ſufficient Excuſe, that they
muſt attend the Reformation and Care of
their own Churches, tho they ſaw that the
<hi>Arrians</hi> then prevail'd every where, and that
their Preſence might have been of a mighty
conſequence for the abating their Rage.</p>
            <p>11. WHAT if our Biſhops ſhould now
make the ſame Anſwers, that they can ſpare
no time from the ſacred Miniſtry, that
they are totally taken up in reſtoring
and reforming their Churches, that they
cannot be ſpared from home five, ſix, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:99001:120"/>
years, and eſpecially in that place where
they can do no good? for our Biſhops have
not the ſame leiſure with thoſe who luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
ſpend their time in Palaces at <hi>Rome,</hi>
and depend upon the Cardinals, and lye at
the catch for rich Preferments; for our
Churches are ſo miſerably ruin'd and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
by the ill Management of theſe men,
that it is neither a ſmall time nor an ordinary
Diligence that can reform them. And now
we ſee plainly that they deſign a Diverſion
and miſ-ſpending of our times, that when
there is no need of it, we may be drawn
from Home, and ſo may neither promote
the Reformation at Home, nor be ſuffered
by them to do it in the Council.</p>
            <p>12. For the Pope indeed does but diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
with the World (that you may not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded)
he intends no Council: nor are you
to think that he acts any thing ſincerely and
truly. <hi>He that knows not how to diſſemble</hi> (ſaid
<hi>Lewis</hi> the 11th. to <hi>Charles</hi> the 8th. his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor)
<hi>knows not how to Reign:</hi> And much
more he that knows not how to diſſemble,
and conceal his Counſels under the Gravity
of his Looks, as things go now, will never
be able to act the part of a Pope, <hi>for that See
is ſupported meerly by Hypocriſie;</hi> and is forced
to ſupply the Defects of a natural Strength
with pretended Colours and Shews. For if
the Popes did indeed think that a <hi>General
Council</hi> was of ſuch wonderful efficacy for the
ſuppreſſing Schiſms, why did they ſo very
long delay ſo neceſſary a means of it? Why
did they ſit ſtill thirty years, and ſuffer <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
Doctrine to take root? Why did they
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:99001:121"/>
not preſently call a Council? Why did they
at laſt call the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> with great
unwillingneſs and reluctancy, and more by
the Impulſe of <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperor, than by
their own free Wills? and when the Council
had ſit almoſt ten years at <hi>Trent,</hi> why after
ſo tedious a Conſultation, was nothing
brought to an Iſſue? Why did they leave
their Buſineſs undone? Who hindred them?
Who withſtood them? Believe me in this
my Brother, the Pope has no deſign now
that a Council ſhould meet, or Religion be
reform'd, which they perfectly deſpiſe. All
their Buſineſs, Deſires and Contentions, aim
at nothing but the deluding the Minds of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Men, and the whole World, with
the Expectation of a General Council.</p>
            <p>13. THEY ſee long ſince that their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
are diminiſhed and ruin'd, that their
Arts have not the ſame ſucceſs they have had
heretofore, that an Incredible number of men
do every day fall off from them; there is not
now that vaſt concourſe of People to <hi>Rome;</hi>
men do neither eſteem nor purchaſe their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences,
Interdictions, Benedictions, Abſolutions,</hi>
and <hi>vain Bulls</hi> at the Rate they have done;
the Sales of their <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Maſſes,</hi> and
all that Whoriſh Paint is not much valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
ſo that a very great part of their Pomp
and Tyranny is fallen, their <hi>Incoms</hi> reduced to
a lower Ebb than ever; they and their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans
are become the Scorn of Children, ſo
that now their whole Concern is at the Stake:
Nor is there any wonder that thoſe things
ſhould fall, which were ſupported by no
roots. Our Saviour JESUS CHRIST
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:99001:121"/>
hath put an end to them, not by Arms or the
force of Soldiers, but by an Heavenly Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe,
and the Breath of his mouth; and he
will intirely conſume and aboliſh them by
the brightneſs of his coming: ſuch is the
force of the Word of God, the Power of the
Goſpel; and theſe <hi>are the Weapons which will
bring down every high thing which is built up or
exalted againſt the Knowledge of God.</hi> This
Doctrine ſhall be preached in ſpite of all
throughout the World, and the Gates of Hell
ſhall not prevail againſt it; the Merit-mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
Shops at <hi>Rome</hi> do now lye deſolate; their
Wares (Like the Goods of <hi>Porſenna</hi>) are cried
at a low price, and there is ſcarce any to buy
them; a poor Dealer in <hi>Indulgences</hi> does now
wander about, and rarely finds a Fool that
will purchaſe one. This Sir, is the great
Concern; from hence ſpring the Papal Tears
and Cares; they ſee this Light ſprung out of
one ſmall Spark, and what now may be the
Event when there are ſo many Fires kindled
every where on the Earth, and ſo many
Chriſtian Kings and Princes own and proſeſs
the Goſpel? for theſe men do no ſerve our
Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> but their own Bellies.
There goes a Story, that when <hi>Carneades</hi> the
Philoſopher was at <hi>Rome,</hi> and made that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
Oration againſt Juſtice, amongſt
other things, he added this, <hi>That this Virtue,
if it was a Virtue, was not of leſs uſe to any
part of Mankind, than to the</hi> Romans; <hi>for they,
by Force and Stealth had ſubdued thoſe Kingdoms
to themſelves, which of right belonged to other
men, and by a moſt flagrant Injuſtice had arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Empire of the World; and that if now
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:99001:122"/>
they ſhould fall to the Exerciſe of Juſtice, all
theſe muſt be reſtored to the right owners, which
they poſſeſs'd ſo unjuſtly; and ſo they ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to their Shepherds Cottages, and poor cold
Sheds, which was all they had at firſt.</hi> And ſo
now theſe, if they ſhould lay aſide their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation,
and act ſincerely, and do their
Duty, and give every one what was truly
their own, they muſt then return to the Staff
and Scrip again, to Sobriety and Modeſty,
to the Labours and Duty of a Biſhop; for
they have heard what St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaid, <hi>Biſhop,
is a Name of Labour, and not of Honour:</hi> and
that they were no Biſhops who ſought more
to be over the People, than to do them good,
and therefore they ſee that the ſpreading of
the Goſpel is of leſs advantage to them than
to any other men in the World; for if ever
they ſhould entertain a thought of reforming,
they are undone, and therefore now they fill
the World with Tumults and Diſorders; as
<hi>Demetrius</hi> the Silver-Smith heretofore did,
when he ſaw his Trade was going down.
And this is the true cauſe why Councils are
now call'd, and the Biſhops and Abbots are
aſſembled; for this ſeems now the cunningeſt
way, to prolong the time for ſome few
years, by ſuſpending the minds of men with
Expectation: and in the interim, many
things (as is uſual) may happen, a War may
break out, ſome of the Princes may dye, and
the ſtrange Inclinations of Men towards the
Reformation, may be blunted by delays,
and languiſh by degrees, <hi>and in the mean time</hi>
(as one ſaid) <hi>I hope ſomething will be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:99001:122"/>
14. OF old, when the <hi>Athenians</hi> (after
they had beaten the <hi>Perſians</hi> out of <hi>Greece</hi>)
began to rebuild their Walls, which they
themſelves had levell'd with the Ground dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the War. And the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> that
they might ſtill have the <hi>Athenians</hi> at their
Mercy, did ſeverely prohibit them not to do
it: <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> the General of the <hi>Athenians,</hi>
promiſed that he would go to <hi>Lacedemon,</hi>
and deliberate with them about this Buſineſs;
and accordingly, when he had began his
Journey, that he might gain time, firſt he
pretended a Sickneſs, that he might ſtay a
while by the way; and when at laſt he got
to <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> he began one Delay after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
one while the Articles did not pleaſe
him; another while, he muſt conſider of
them a while; now he muſt ſtay for his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Ambaſſadors, without whom he could
do nothing; and ſoon after, he muſt ſend
Meſſengers to <hi>Athens,</hi> to know their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
and in the interim, whilſt he was
ſpinning out the time, the <hi>Athenians</hi> fortified
their City, that in caſe any Force were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
againſt them, they might be in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to repel it: and juſt thus our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
by gaining one day after another, and
pretending to refer all thins to a Council, in
the mean time build their own Walls, whilſt
we ſit ſtill and expect I know not what
Wonders from them, and in the end; when
they have taken their Meaſures, and put
their Affairs out of danger, then they will
ſhut us out of doors, and tell us that no
Council can be held, nor any thing elſe
done.</p>
            <p>

15. FOR it is worth the while to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their Arts and Stratagems; how often
have Councils been call'd, and yet have not
met? how often has a ſmall flying Rumour
defeated all their Preparations, and other
mens Expectations? How often have the
Purple <hi>Dons</hi> ſlipt home, without doing any
thing, and adjourn'd the next Seſſion to the
ninth or tenth year? How often has the
Weather, Proviſions, the Place, or the Time
not ſuited with their Humors? For the Pope
alone calls the Councils, and diſmiſſeth them
when he will: if any thing doth not pleaſe
him, or things begin to go croſs to his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
preſently you hear his <hi>Valete &amp; Plaudite,
Clap your Hands and farewell.</hi> A Council was
call'd at <hi>Baſil,</hi> great numbers aſſembled from
all Places, many things were ſeriouſly debated:
Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> is condemn'd as an Heretick
and a Simonaical Prelate by all the Votes;
and <hi>Amideus,</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> ſubſtituted in
his place. <hi>Eugenius,</hi> as he had reaſon, takes
this ill, as a thing of bad example to Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
<hi>his Power being very much above all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils:
no Council can meet</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>but by his
Order, nor determine any thing againſt his Will,
therefore it is a lewd thing to ſearch into his Life
in a</hi> Conventicle <hi>of Biſhops.</hi> So without delay,
he calls the Council firſt to <hi>Ferrara</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi>
and then tranſlates it to <hi>Florence.</hi> What is
the matter I pray? did Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> think
the change of Air would produce a change
in their Minds, or that the Holy Ghoſt
would give Anſwers more wiſely in <hi>Italy,</hi>
than he had in <hi>Germany?</hi> No, he did not
ſeek Chriſt in all his Changes, but his
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:99001:123"/>
own dear Intereſt; he ſaw that in <hi>Germany,
Sigiſmund</hi> the Emperor was his Enemy, and
that his authority, and the Favour he had
there, was too great; and he thought that if
theſe Fathers were tranſplanted from thoſe
cold Climates into <hi>Italy</hi> (they might like trees
removed) become more mild, and their Fruit
more pleaſant: for (O immortal God!) that
is not now any part of the Buſineſs of a
Council to find out the Truth, or ſuppreſs
Falſhood; the only Buſineſs of Popes in
Councils in theſe latter Ages, has been the
confirming the <hi>Roman Tyranny,</hi> the promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Wars,</hi> the <hi>imbroiling the Chriſtian Princes,
and engaging them one againſt another; the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying
Mony,</hi> ſometimes for Expeditions into
the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> at other times for the building
St. <hi>Peters Church;</hi> ſometimes for I know not
what other Uſes, or rather Abuſes, which all
tended to promote the Luxury and Luſts of a
few ill men: and theſe were the only Aims
of all the late Councils, for as for the Errors
and Abuſes, as if there had been none, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could ever be handled.</p>
            <p>16. <hi>Petrus Alliacenſis</hi> complain'd much in
the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> concerning the <hi>Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice
and Inſolence of the Court of</hi> Rome: But
what did he gain by it? What part of their
<hi>Avarice or Inſolence</hi> was ever reſtrain'd by the
Authority of any Council? and he moved
too that the number of <hi>Holy Days,</hi> and the
Herds of lazy Monks might be diminiſhed;
and another (in a certain Work which is
call'd the <hi>Tripartite,</hi> and is put in the end of
the Council of <hi>Laterane</hi>) ſaith, <hi>that the whole
World is ſcandalized, and ſpeaks againſt the vaſt
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:99001:124"/>
Multitude of begging Fryars,</hi> and the Fathers in
that <hi>Laterane Council</hi> ſay, <hi>We command all men
ſtreightly for time to come, not to invent any more
new Religious Orders.</hi> From theſe times to
ours, what has been done concerning <hi>Holy Days</hi>
I know not, but it is highly probable there
hath been no diminution of them: but the
Order of Monks hath been infinitely encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for the late Popes have added the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi>
the <hi>Capuchins,</hi> and the <hi>Theatins,</hi> as if we had
not had before a ſufficient Swarm of <hi>Idle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

John Gerſon,</hi> Chancellor of <hi>Paris</hi> offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Fathers of the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi>
a Catalogue of LXXV. <hi>Abuſes in the Church
of</hi> Rome, <hi>which he earneſtly deſired might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;</hi>
but now of ſo great a number, what
one Abuſe have they ſince reformed? <hi>Johan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
Picus Mirandula</hi> writes to Pope <hi>Leo, that
he would diminiſh the number of vain Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
and curb the Luxury of the Prieſts.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this, a great number of Biſhops met in
the <hi>Laterane</hi> Council, with a mighty expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the whole World; but what one Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
did they cut off? What one Prieſt did
they puniſh for Luxury and Wickendeſs? the
Poet <hi>Mantuan</hi> complained (by name) of the
Manners of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> St. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi>
the Abbot wrote thus to <hi>Eugenius</hi> the
Pope, <hi>your Court ſometimes receives good Men,
but it makes none: the bad do there thrive, the
good are ruin'd.</hi> And concerning the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſtate in which the Church then was, he
writes that <hi>from the Crown of the Head to the
Sole of the Foot there is no ſoundneſs.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<hi>where is he that preacheth the acceptable
year of the Lord? they do not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in theſe
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:99001:124"/>
times keep but corrupt the Spouſe of Chriſt; they,
do not keep, but kill and devour the Lords Flock.</hi>
Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the VI. when he ſent his <hi>Legate</hi>
into <hi>Germany,</hi> did ingeniouſly and truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
that <hi>the ſtate of the whole Clergy was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
corrupt: all we, the Eccleſiaſtical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>have declined every one into his
way, and there is not now one that doth good, no,
not one. Albertus Pighius</hi> confeſſeth, that in
the <hi>very Maſs,</hi> which they will have to be
moſt ſacred, and in which they place the
Center of all the Chriſtian Religion, <hi>there
may be found Abuſes and Errors.</hi> And why
ſhould Words be multiplied? I omit other
Witneſſes, for they are almoſt infinite; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Councils have been held ſince that time,
and Biſhops aſſembled; and the Synod of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil</hi>
was expreſly call'd, as they then pretended,
for the Reformation of the whole Clergy;
but notwithſtanding, from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
Errors increaſed every where, and the
Corruptions of the Clergy became twice
more than they were before.</p>
            <p>17. THE Cardinals who were nominated
and choſen by Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the III. to conſider
the State of the Church, gave in this Anſwer,
<hi>That there were many things faulty in the Church,
and eſpecially in the Manners of the Biſhops and
inferior Clergy; that the Biſhops were lazy, and
did not teach the People, feed the Flock, or take
care of the Vineyard; that they lived in the
Courts of Princes, and were rarely reſident; that
there was ſometimes three, and at others, four
Biſhopricks held in</hi> commendam <hi>by one Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
which tended very much to the Dammage of
the Church: for thoſe multiplied Offices</hi> (as they
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:99001:125"/>
ſaid) <hi>were not compatible or to be held together (nor
could be well managed by any one perſon) and that
all the Cloyſtered Orders ſhould be baniſhed out of
the Church.</hi> After this, there was a Council
at <hi>Trent;</hi> but did the Biſhops from that time
begin to feed the Flock? or did they ceaſe
from their former Non-reſidence, or abſtain
from frequenting the Courts of Princes? did
the Cardinals ceaſe from multiplying Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks?
or was any care taken that the Church
might have no dammage by it? were the
Conventual Orders diminiſhed? is Religion
reformed amongſt them? what occaſion
then was there that ſo many Biſhops ſhould
be aſſembled from very diſtant places, or
ſhould to no purpoſe deliberate ſo many
years concerning the Reformation of the
Church? this in truth is juſt as if the <hi>Phariſees</hi>
ſhould pretend to reſtore the Temple of God
to its former Sanctity.</p>
            <p>18. THEY confeſs the errors and Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
convoke Councils, fain a great care of
Religion and Piety, promiſe their utmoſt
Labour and Induſtry for the reſtitution of
whatever is fallen into decay, and that they
will joyn with us in this Work. That is, juſt
after that manner as the Enemies of the
People of God of old ſaid, that <hi>they would,
together with</hi> Nehemia, <hi>help to build the Temple
of the Lord;</hi> for indeed their deſign was not
to promote the building of the Temple of
the Lord, but to hinder it as much as they
could poſſibly: they would willingly make a
Peace with us, but it is upon the terms offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Nahaſh</hi> to the Jews of <hi>Jabeſh,</hi> if we will
ſuffer them to bore out our right Eyes; that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:99001:125"/>
is, if we will ſuffer them to deprive us of the
Word of God, the Goſpel of our Salvation.</p>
            <p>19. FOR have they any concern for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?
do they take any care of the Church
of God, who never regarded the Wrath of
God, nor the Salvation of the People, nor
any part of their Office? they ſay, let <hi>Pan</hi>
take care of his Sheep. They in the mean time
mannage Wars, Hunt, take their Pleaſures
and fare deliciouſly. That I may not mention
any thing that is more baſe. O immortal God!
who can think that theſe men ever think
on the Church of God or Religion? when
or what Errors will theſe men ever remove?
what Light will they afford to us? what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you ſay, tho you could bring the Sun it
ſelf in your hands, yet they would never the
more ſee. They excuſe, paint, and comb as
much as ever they can, the moſt manifeſt
Errors, as <hi>Symachus</hi> or <hi>Porphyrius</hi> heretofore
did the Heathen Errors and Follies. All
their buſineſs is to perſwade the World that
they have not deceived the People, and that
they have not err'd in any thing; or if they
ſometimes prevail upon themſelves to reform
any thing, which they never, or very rarely
and ſparingly do, they imitate <hi>Alexander</hi> the
<hi>Roman</hi> Emperor, who not being totally averſe
to the Chriſtian Religion, is reported to have
worſhiped Chriſt and <hi>Orpheus</hi> in the ſame
Chappel; or as the ancient <hi>Samaritans</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
together the Worſhip of the true God,
and the Service of Idols; ſo they will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
perhaps receive ſome part of the Goſpel
upon condition that they may at the ſame
time retain their Superſtition and their doting
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:99001:126"/>
Errors; they receive ſome Truths, upon
condition they may hold ſome other things
which are falſe; they do ſo approve ours, as
not to diſapprove their own; and ſo they do
not take away Abuſes, but colour them over,
and only new caſe the old Pillars.</p>
            <p>20. THIS is their way of reforming the
Church of God, thus they celebrate Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Councils; the Truth is not ſerved, but
Affection, the better part is brought under by
the greater; the very Name of a <hi>General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi>
is beautiful and glorious, but Poiſon is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
given in a beautiful Cup: for it is not
ſufficient that ſome Biſhops and Abbots meet
in one place; the efficacy of a Council is not
placed in Miters and Purple Robes; nor is
whatever a Council decrees, preſently to be
taken for an Oracle. It was a Council of
which the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> writes thus,<note place="margin">XXX. I. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint verſion. Chap. 8. v. 10. Pſal. 2. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Wo to
the rebellious Children, ſaith the Lord, who aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a Council, but not by me; take Council, ſaith he,
and it ſhall come to nought,</hi> in another place. It
was a Council of which the Prophet <hi>David</hi>
ſaith thus, <hi>The Kings of the Earth ſtand up, and
the Rulers take Counſel together againſt the Lord,
and againſt his Chriſt.</hi> It was a Council which
condemn'd the Son of God Jeſus Chriſt to the
Croſs; it was a Council, and celebrated at
<hi>Carthage</hi> under St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> which decreed that
thoſe that were baptized by Hereticks, when
they returned to the Church ſhould be rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized;
which Error was afterwards forc'd to
be repeal'd by ſo many Councils and Writings
of the Fathers. And: what need is there of
ſo many Words? The ſecond Council of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus</hi>
was openly for <hi>Eutyches,</hi> that <hi>the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:99001:126"/>
Nature of Chriſt was changed into the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.</hi>
The ſecond Council of <hi>Nice</hi> decreed
a manifeſt Idolatry in the Worſhip of Images.
The Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> as <hi>Albertus Pighius</hi>
ſaith, <hi>decreed againſt all Antiquity, againſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
againſt Reaſon, and againſt the Word of
God.</hi> The Council of <hi>Ariminium</hi> wickedly
decreed for <hi>Arrius, that Chriſt was not God;</hi> and
to conclude, many other Councils afterwards
erred too, as the <hi>Selucian,</hi> and the <hi>Syrmian,</hi>
which did both condemn the <hi>Homouſians</hi> or
<hi>Catholicks,</hi> and alſo ſubſcribed to the impious
Hereſie of the Council of <hi>Ariminium.</hi> Why
do you doubt? the very Council of <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
which was one of the four which Pope
<hi>Gregory</hi> compar'd to the four <hi>Evangeliſts;</hi>
Pope <hi>Leo</hi> made no Scruple to accuſe that
very Council of Temerity of Raſhneſs.</p>
            <p>21. THUS we ſee ſome Councils to
have been contrary to other Councils; and
that as Pope <hi>Leo</hi> quaſh'd the Acts of <hi>Adrian,
Stephen</hi> of <hi>Formoſus, John</hi> of <hi>Stephen;</hi> and
that as Pope <hi>Sabinian commanded all the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of Pope</hi> Gregory <hi>to be burnt as perverſe and
wicked;</hi> ſo very often a latter Council has
abrogated all the Decrees of a former. The
Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> decreed, <hi>that the Biſhop
of</hi> Rome <hi>ſhould not be call'd the higheſt Prieſt, or
the Prince of the Prieſts, or by any other ſuch like
Title:</hi> but the latter Councils have not only
call'd him the <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> but the <hi>Great Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff,
and the Head of the Univerſal Church.</hi> The
<hi>Eliberitan</hi> Council decreed, that it ſhould not
be lawful, <hi>that what was worſhipped ſhould be
painted on the Walls of the Churches.</hi> The
Council of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> decreed, <hi>that Images
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:99001:127"/>
were not to be endured in the Chriſtian Churches;</hi>
on the other ſide, the ſecond Council of
<hi>Nice</hi> did <hi>allow them not only to be erected in
Churches, but alſo to be worſhiped.</hi> The <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rane</hi>
Council under Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the II. was
call'd for no other purpoſe but to reſcind the
Decrees of the Council of <hi>Piſa:</hi> thus the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Biſhops frequently oppoſe the forgoing,
and ſome Councils damm up the Lights of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
and theſe men will not be bound, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by their own Councils, any farther than
they pleaſe and is for their Convenience,
and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>brings Griſt to their Mill.</hi>
The Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> decreed, that <hi>a Council
of Biſhops is above the Pope;</hi> but the <hi>Laterane</hi>
Council under Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> decreed the Pope
to be above a Council. And the Pope doth
not only carry himſelf ſo as if he thought ſo;
but alſo <hi>if any man is of the Opinion of this
Council, he commands him to bo reputed a Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</hi>
I pray Sir, what would you do here?
whatever you ſay or think, either the Pope
or the Council will make you a Heretick,
and all the Popes for ſome Ages, have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
theſe Truths of the Council of <hi>Baſil;</hi>
and therefore in the eſteem of the Council of
<hi>Baſil,</hi> all the Popes, for all theſe laſt Ages,
are Hereticks. The ſame Council with one
Voice, depoſed Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> for Simony
and Schiſm, and named <hi>Amideus</hi> for his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor.
But yet <hi>Eugenius</hi> did not regard the
Decree of the Council, and altho he was a
<hi>Simoniſt</hi> and a <hi>Schiſmatick,</hi> yet he did not
ceaſe to be the Succeſſor of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car</hi>
of Chriſt, and the <hi>Head of the Catholick
Church,</hi> and in ſpite of all, retaind his former
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:99001:127"/>
Dignity, and was born as before on the
ſhoulders of Noble Men magnificently and
loftily. And <hi>Amideus,</hi> a ſimple man, like
one unhorſed, walked upon his Feet, and
thought himſelf happy enough, that of a
<hi>Pope</hi> he was become a <hi>Cardinal.</hi> The late
Council at <hi>Trent</hi> made a Decree, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
ſhould teach the People, and that no
one of them ſhould at the ſame time have
two or more Biſhopricks: they on the other
ſide, contrary to the Canon of their own
Council, enjoy Pluralities, and teach no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and ſo they make ſuch Laws as they
will not be bound by but when they pleaſe;
at this rate have they ever valued their own
Councils and Decrees.</p>
            <p>22. AND now (Sir) what reaſon have
we to expect at this time a better Event of
things? for, for what cauſe, upon what hope
and Expectation is the Council held? be
pleaſed Sir, to conſider with your ſelf but this
one thing, what kind of Men they are, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whoſe Fidelity, Learning and Judgment
the weight of the whole Council, the debat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all thoſe great Queſtions, and the ſum of
the whole Affair depends? they are indeed
call'd Abbots and Biſhops grave Men, and
great Names, and, as it is thought, of great
account in the Management of the Church
of God; but if you ſtrip them of the Names,
Robes, and Perſonages of ſuch Men, what
have they that is at all like a Biſhop or an
Abbot? for they are no Miniſters of Chriſt,
no Diſpenſers of the Myſteries of God; they
do not attend the reading, nor teach the
Goſpel, nor feed the Flock, nor till the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:99001:128"/>
Ground, nor plant the Vincyard, nor light
the Fire, nor carry the Ark of the Lord, nor
perform the Ambaſſie of Chriſt, nor Watch,
nor do the Work of an Evangeliſt; they do
not fulfil their Miniſtery, they entangle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in ſecular Affairs; they hide the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of their Lord, and take away the Keys
of the Kingdom of God; they neither go in
themſelves, nor do they ſuffer others to enter;
they beat their Fellow Servants; they feed
themſelves and not the Flock; they ſleep,
they ſnore, they feaſt, they fare deliciouſly;
they are Clouds without Water, Stars with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Light, dumb Dogs, ſlow Bellies, and as
St. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaid, <hi>they are not Prelates but Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats;
not Teachers, but Seducers; not Paſters, but
Impoſtors: the Servants of Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſerve
Antichriſt.</hi> And theſe are the only men to
whom the Popes will allow a Place and Vote
in the Council; in their Judgments and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
will they have the whole Care and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
of the Catholick Church to be:
Pope <hi>Pius</hi> hath now choſen theſe alone to put
his Truſt in; but O good God! what kind
of Mortals, what ſort of Men are theſe? and
yet as they think, all theſe Queries are ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous:
for it is not, ſay they, one farthing
difference, whether they be Learned or Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
or no, or what they will or think; for in
truth it is ſufficient if they can but ride upon
a Mule, and with great State and Noiſe
make the publick <hi>Cavalcade</hi> to the Council,
and when they cam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> there ſay nothing. If
Sir you will not believe me, and conceive I
have fain'd all this for Diverſion and Sport,
be but pleaſed to hear the Honorable Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:99001:128"/>
and what the moſt ſacred Faculty of
the whole <hi>Sorbon</hi> decreed in this caſe; that,
ſay they, which our Maſter have ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
a legitimate Aſſembly, is, <hi>That it is
to be noted, that to the legitimate aſſembling of a
Council, it is ſufficient that the Solemnity and
Form of the Law be ſolemnly obſerved: for if any
man would bring this in queſtion, whether the
Prelates that ſit there have a good Intention, and
whether they be learned, and whether they have
the Knowledge of the Holy Scripture, and a mind
well diſpoſed to ſound Doctrine, the Proceſs would be
infinite;</hi> for they it ſeems who ſit as mute as the
Statues of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and know not in the leaſt
what Religion is, will yet anſwer wondrous

they muſt not ſpeak what they think, and

that being plainly guilty of many Crimes, he
would not commit his Reputation and Fame

ſaith, or determine any thing, but as it beſt
pleaſeth them.</p>
            <p>24. AND thus is all that Liberty which
ought to be in all Conſultations, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in thoſe which concern holy things, and
which doth beſt befit the holy Spirit, and the
Modeſty of Chriſtian Men, wholly taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 30.</note> that <hi>if any thing be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed

of <hi>Prague</hi> is an excellent Witneſs againſt them;
which two men they murthered contrary to
the publick Faith, and were thereby falſe
both to God and Man. So the falſe Prophet

years ſince, in the late Council at <hi>Trent,</hi> the
Ambaſſadors of the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> and of
the free Towns who came thither, that they
might be heard, were excluded out of the
Aſſembly, and denied the Liberty of Speech:
for the Biſhops and Abbots ſaid they would
ſuffer no free Debate of the Cauſe, nor
would they determine the Controverſies by
the Word of God; and that thoſe of our
Side were not to be heard, except they would
recant; which if they refuſed, they were to
expect no other terms in the Council, but to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:99001:130"/>
be condem'd; for <hi>Julius</hi> the III. in his <hi>Brief,</hi>
by which he call'd that Council, publickly
declared, <hi>that if they did not change their Minds,
they ſhould be condemned for Hereticks without
ever hearing their</hi> Cauſe. And <hi>Pius</hi> the IV.
who hath now reſolved to call again that
Council, hath by the prejudice of his own ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Judgment, commanded all thoſe who have
made defection from the Authority of the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (that is, the greateſt part of
Chriſtendom) without ever ſeeing or hearing
them to be taken and reputed Hereticks. They
are wont to ſay, and that upon all occaſions,
<hi>that all things are well, and that they will not
ſuffer the leaſt part of their Doctrine and Religion
to be altered. Albertus Pighius</hi> ſaith, that
<hi>without the Command of the Church of</hi> Rome,
<hi>the moſt plain place of Scripture is not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</hi>
Now is this their way to reſtore the
Church to her Integrity? Is this their ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>25. AND altho theſe things are moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,
and moſt contrary to the Practice of
the ancient Councils, and the Uſage of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
and good Men in their Deliberations;
yet it is much more unreaſonable, that
whereas the whole World complains of the
Ambition and Tyranny of the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and is perſwaded, that until he is reduced to
a better Order, all their Labours for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of the Church of God will be in
vain, and nothing will be done; yet at laſt,
all things are referred to him alone, as to the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:99001:130"/>
moſt equal Arbiter and Judge. But (O good
God!) to what Man? I will not now ſay
any of theſe things againſt him; that he is
an Enemy of the Truth, an Ambitious Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
Proud Man, who is already become
intolerable to his own: But I ſay that it is
the utmoſt pitch of Folly and Injuſtice, to
make him the ſole Judge of all Religion, who
commands all his Dictates to be had in the
ſelf ſame Honour and Eſteem as the Words
of St. <hi>Peter</hi> are; and ſaith, that in caſe <hi>he

And why ſhould I uſe more words? whom
his own Companions and Miniſters, <hi>Joachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
Abbas, Petrarcha, Marſilius Patavinus, Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentius
Valla,</hi> and <hi>Hieronymus Savanarola</hi> have
not obſcurly hinted to be the Antichriſt. To
the Judgment and Will (I ſay) of this one
Man are all things ſubmitted, that this very
Criminal may be both the Party accuſed,
and the Judge of his own very Caſe; that
this guilty man may ſit aloft upon a Throne,
and his Accuſers ſtand beneath, whilſt he
gives Sentence for himſelf: for Pope <hi>Julius</hi>
had given us theſe juſt and reaſonable Laws.
<hi>There is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>no Council which is valid,
nor ever ſhall be, unleſs ſupported by the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Church of</hi> Rome. And <hi>Bonifacius</hi> the
VIII. ſaith, that <hi>every Creature ought to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:99001:131"/>
to the Church of</hi> Rome; <hi>and that as they ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their Salvation.</hi> And Pope <hi>Paſcal</hi> uſeth
this Expreſſion, <hi>as if any Councils had given
Laws to the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>when in truth,
all the Councils have been held, and received their
Force from the Authority of the Church of</hi> Rome;
<hi>and in all their Statutes, the Authority of the
Pope of</hi> Rome <hi>is plainly and apparently excepted.</hi>
And another ſaith, <hi>whatever the Pope approves
or diſapproves, we ought alſo to approve or diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove:
and what the Pope allows, no other man
may diſallow.</hi> And another Flatterer, who
has loſt all Modeſty, ſaith, that <hi>altho the
whole World ſhould contradict the Opinion of the
Pope in any thing, yet it ſeems but reaſonable to
ſtand to the Iudgment of the Pope.</hi> And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
no leſs impudently ſaith, <hi>it would be a
ſort of Sacriledge to diſpute concerning an Action
of the Pope; who, tho he is not a good man, is yet
ever preſumed to be ſuch.</hi> And another more
impudently, <hi>The Pope</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Will, and therefore in thoſe things which he
wills, his Will is inſtead of a Reaſon to him; nor
is there any man who may ſay to him, why doſt
then act thus?</hi> And that I may paſs by many
other things which might be alledged here,
becauſe they are without number, and at
length come to a Concluſion, Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi>
the IX. more impudently than any other,
uſeth theſe words, <hi>This Judge</hi> (the Pope) <hi>may
neither be judged by the Emperor, nor by Kings,
nor by the while Chrgy, nor yet by all the people.</hi>
O immortal God! how little is wanting of
the Pride of <hi>Luciſer.</hi>

theſe things are true, and the Popes have not
belyed the World, what need is there of a
Council? or if they will hold a ſincere and
free Council, let all theſe things be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
as diſhoneſt and inſolent Lyes, and
let them not only be laid aſide, as to the
court, and uſe of them, but be razed out of
all Books, that the ſum of Affairs may never
more be left to the Will and Luſt of one
man; and he too for many moſt juſt cauſes
ſuſpected. But now on the contrary, <hi>the
Popes ſay they cannot err, and that the Word of
God is to be regulated according to their Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
and beſides all this, before they enter
upon their Papal Dignity, they take an Oath
that they will maintain the Faith of many
late Councils (in which all things are moſt

religiouſly, <hi>that they will not change any thing:</hi>
and therefore what wonder is it, that no
good is done by Councils, that Errors and
Abuſes are not taken away; that the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors
of Princes are to no purpoſe call'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
from ſuch diſtant places, out of all
Lands? and yet I hear that there are ſome
good men at this time, who not well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
what they ſay, tho they condemn
the Pride of the Pope and his Perſian State
and Magnificence, and his Epicurean Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of all Religion, yet they would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
for all that, his Authority ſafe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire;
and tho ſometimes they confeſs him to
be Antichriſt, yet for all that, as ſoon as he
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:99001:132"/>
aſcends that Chair, they do not queſtion but
he is the univerſal Biſhop, and the Head of
the univerſal Church of Chriſt; and here
they pleaſe themſelves, as if the Holy Ghoſt
were neceſſarily fixed to <hi>the Pope Court in the
Adrian Mole; but there is a Proverb, that the
Place doth not ſanctifie the Man, but the Man
the Place.</hi> And St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> as he is cited by
them, ſaith, <hi>they are not the Children of the
Saints, who hold their Places, but thoſe who imitate
their good Actions;</hi> for otherwiſe, as Chriſt
ſaid, <hi>the Scribes and Phariſees ſate in</hi> Moſes
<hi>his Chair, and he commanded his Diſciples to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
and ſubmit to their Authority, ſo far
as they anſwered out of the Word of God. What</hi>
(ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtin) hath Chriſt ſaid more here,
than that the Voice of the Shepherd was heard out
of the Mouth of a mercenary Servant? for ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in that Chair, they teach the Law of God,
therefore God teacheth by them; but if they will
teach their own things, do not hear them, do not
do them;</hi> for St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Antichriſt the Man
of Sin ſhall ſit in the Holy Place;</hi> and therefore
St. <hi>Jerome</hi> doth well admoniſh us, <hi>thou doſt
attend St.</hi> Peter, <hi>but then conſider</hi> Judas; <hi>thou
ſubmiteſt to</hi> Stephen, <hi>but caſt an Eye towards</hi>
Nicholas <hi>as the ſame time; Church Dignity
doth not make a Chriſtian.</hi> Thus St. <hi>Jerome,
and certainly it is ſaid that</hi> Marcellinus <hi>the
Pope did ſacrifice to Idols: Pope</hi> Liberius <hi>was an
Arrian, Pope</hi> John <hi>the</hi> XXII. <hi>was a Heretick,
in the point of the immortality of the Soul; Pope</hi>
John <hi>the</hi> VIII. <hi>was a Woman, and in her Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
by a lewd Luſt, committed Adultery, and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:99001:132"/>
in a Proceſſion, in the midſt of the Pomp, before
the Eyes of the Biſhops and Cardinals, ſhe
brought forth a Child;</hi> and <hi>Liranus</hi> ſaith, <hi>that
many Roman Popes apoſtized from the Faith of
Chriſt;</hi> and therefore we muſt not truſt too
much to Places, Succeſſions, and vain Titles
of Dignity. The impious <hi>Nero</hi> was deſcended
from <hi>Metellus</hi> the Pious, and <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Caia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas</hi>
ſucceeded to <hi>Aaron, and an Idol hath

            </p>
            <p>26. BUT Sir, I beſeech you, what is
that vaſt Power and Authority that they ſo
very inſolently boaſt of? Or from whence
had they it? from Heaven or from Men?
<hi>Chriſt</hi> (ſay they) <hi>ſaid to</hi> Peter, <hi>upon this Rock
will I build my Church: in theſe words the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Power is confirm'd, for the Church of Chriſt
is placed upon</hi> Peter <hi>as upon its Foundation;</hi> but
Chriſt in theſe words gave nothing to St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
apart from the reſt of the Apoſtles, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did he here make any mention of the
Pope or City of <hi>Rome.</hi> Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is that <hi>Rock,</hi>
Chriſt, is <hi>that Foundation: No man</hi> (ſaith St.
<hi>Paul) can lay another Foundation, than that
which is already laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>27. <hi>And St.</hi> Auguſtin, upon this Rock (<hi>ſaith
he</hi>) I will build my Church: <hi>by the Words,</hi>
upon this Rock (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) is underſtood the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
made by <hi>Peter,</hi> ſaying, thou art Chriſt the
Son of the living God; <hi>for (ſaith he) it is</hi> not
ſaid thou art a Rock, but thou art <hi>Peter,</hi> but the
Rock was Chriſt. <hi>And St.</hi> Baſil, <hi>upon theſe words,</hi>
upon this Rock, that is (<hi>ſaith he</hi> upon this Faith
I will build my Church. <hi>And the moſt ancient
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:99001:133"/>
Father</hi> Origen, the Rock (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) is every Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Chriſt, after he hath drunk of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Rock which follows; and upon every ſuch
Rock is all the Churches Doctrine built. <hi>Now
(Sir) if you will ſuppoſe that the whole
Church is built only upon</hi> Peter, <hi>what will
you ſay of</hi> John <hi>the Son of Thunder, and all
the reſt of the Apoſtles? Or ſhall we dare to
ſay that the</hi> Gates of Hell <hi>ſhall never prevail
againſt</hi> Peter <hi>only, but againſt the reſt of the
Apoſtles and Heads of the Church thoſe
Gates may prevail? or rather is that Saying,</hi>
that the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail, <hi>to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
of all and every one of them of
whom it was ſpoken? and ſo is that other
Expreſſion to be taken too,</hi> upon this Rock
will I build my Church. <hi>And are the Keys of
the Kingdom of Heaven given only to</hi> Peter
<hi>by Chriſt, or was no other of the bleſſed
(Apoſtles) to receive them? But if that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,</hi>
to thee will I give the Keys of the
Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>be to be underſtood as
ſpoken to all the reſt as well as to</hi> Peter, <hi>why
then ſhould not all that was ſpoken, as well
what went before, as what follows after,
tho ſpoken to St.</hi> Peter, <hi>yet be common to
all the Apoſtles?</hi> There is (<hi>ſaith</hi> Hillary) one
happy Rock of Faith, which <hi>Peter</hi> confeſſed
with his Mouth; <hi>and again,</hi> upon this Confeſſion
of <hi>Peter</hi>'s is the Church built; <hi>and not much
after,</hi> this Faith is the Foundation of the Church.
<hi>And after the ſame manner the other Fathers
alſo</hi> Jerome, Cyril <hi>and</hi> Bede <hi>ſay, the Church
is built not upon</hi> Peter, <hi>but upon the Faith
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:99001:133"/>
of</hi> Peter, <hi>that is, on Jeſus Chriſt the Son of
God, whom</hi> Peter, <hi>by an Heavenly inſtinct,
confeſſed,</hi> Peter (<hi>ſaith St.</hi> Auguſtin) was ſo
call'd from the Rock, not the Rock from <hi>Peter;</hi>
nor did Chriſt ſay, I will build my ſelf upon thee,
but I will build thee upon me. <hi>And</hi> Nicholas
Liranus, <hi>tho he is not always a good Author,
for you know in what Age he lived, yet
he rightly took this;</hi> upon this Rock (<hi>ſaith he</hi>)
that is, upon Chriſt: and therefore the Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
depend upon any man, by reaſon of his Dignity
and Eccleſiaſtical Power, for many Popes have
proved Apoſtates.</p>
            <p>28. IN what then is this Papal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
placed? In Teaching, but they teach
nothing; in adminiſtring the Sacraments,
but they do not adminiſter them; in feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but they feed none. Now this is all
the Power which Chriſt beſtowed upon the
Apoſtles; <hi>Go ye</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>into all the World
and preach the Goſpel,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>hence forward ye
ſhall be Fiſhers of Men;</hi> and as the <hi>living Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſent me, ſo I ſend you.</hi> But as to theſe,
whither go they? what do they teach?
what do they preach? what do they fiſh
for? from whence go they? or by whom
are they ſent? their's is nor Apoſtolick Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
but Pride, and an intolerable Lordſhip
uſurped by Force and Tyranny. <hi>None of us</hi>
(ſaith <hi>Cyprian) calls himſelf Biſhop of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
or compells his Partners to a neceſſitated
Obedience by a Tyrannical Terror. Seeing every
Biſhop may uſe his Liberty and Power accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his own Diſcretion, as he cannot be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:99001:134"/>
by another, ſo neither can he judge another.
And as the other Apoſtles</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>were the
ſame which</hi> Peter <hi>was;</hi>
               <note place="margin">All Biſhops equal.</note> 
               <hi>ſo all Biſhops are endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with this equal Partnerſhip both of Honour and
Power.</hi> And St. <hi>Jerome</hi> (ſaith, <hi>greater is the
Authority of the World, than that of any City.
Why then do you produce to me the Cuſtom of one
City? Why do you vindicate that Paucity, from
which this Pride aroſe againſt the Laws of the
Church?</hi> Where-ever a Biſhop is ſetled, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at</hi> Rome, <hi>or</hi> Eugubium, <hi>whether at</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople
<hi>or</hi> Rhegium, <hi>he is of the ſame
Worth, and of the ſelf ſame Prieſthood; the
greatneſs of Riches, and the Humility of Poverty
makes not one Biſhop ſuperior or inferior to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
And St. <hi>Gregory</hi> (ſaith, Peter <hi>was a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Member in the Body;</hi> John, Andrew, <hi>and</hi>
James <hi>were the Heads of particular People, and
yet all of them are Members of the Church in one
Head; yea, the Saints before the Law, thoſe
under the Law, and thoſe under Grace, and all
thoſe who make up the Body of our Lord</hi> (the
Church) <hi>are to be accounted Members, and
no man ever yet deſired to be call'd an
UNIVERSAL.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>29. THIS is that Power which ſome
men defend ſo ſtoutly in this Age; ſo that
whatever they think of the Popes Life or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
yet they would have this Authority
Sacred and untouched, as if the Church of
God could not be ſafe without it: or as if,
without the Popes Will and Conſent, a
Council could be no Council; and that if
the whole World ſhould think contrary to
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:99001:134"/>
what he doth, it would be nothing. And
therefore when you ſee (Sir) that theſe things
are thus ill managed, you ought not to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
that when nothing is now ſincerely and
truly acted in Councils, our Men had rather
ſtay at home, than travail ſo far to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
to a Place where they are ſure to loſe
their Labour and their Cauſe too.</p>
            <p>30. <hi>BUT Sir, you ſay in the next place, it
is a Sin to change any thing in Religion, without
the Conſent of the Pope and a Council.</hi> Why
Sir? the very Popes themſelves have changed
almoſt the whole State of the Primitive
Church without any Council; and tho this
is indeed a very ſpecious and winning Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
yet it is made a Cover and Defence
for moſt foul Errors; for they only ſeek to
delay the Minds of Men with a tedious
Expectation, that by lingring and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs,
they may take off their Edge and
Keenneſs, and ſo by degrees, make them
caſt off all Hopes of a Reformation.
For, what would they have the People of
God be deceived, err, be deluded and
involved in Error, and in the Ignorance
of God, and be led into eternal Ruine
and Deſtruction, whilſt the Pope calls a
Council, and the Abbots and Biſhops
(<hi>meet, debate, ſettle things</hi>) and then return
home? Is it not lawful for any of us to
believe in Chriſt, to proſeſs the Goſpel,
to worſhip God rightly and truly, to fly
from Superſtitions and Worſhip of
Idols, except theſe men pleaſe to give us
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:99001:135"/>
leave? In truth, the ſtate of the Church
of God were very deplorable, if in the
midſt of ſo many far ſpread, groſs, blind,
foul, apparent and manifeſt, Errors, ſo that
our very Enemies themſelves cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
them; nothing could be done for
her Relief, without the Concourſe of the
whole World and a <hi>General Council,</hi> or at
leaſt, of ſuch a Council as we cannot
hope for with any certainty, and the
event of which, if we now had it, is much
more uncertain. When of old, the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi>
invaded <hi>Greece,</hi> and began to deſtroy
all before them, and the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> whoſe
valour was then much famed amongſt the
<hi>Grecians,</hi> and therefore it was but reaſonable
they ſhould have been the firſt in the defence
of their Country; yet becauſe they had an
ancient Cuſtom and a Superſtitious conceit
that had poſſeſſed them from the time of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus,</hi>
that it was ominous and unfortunate
to begin a Martial Expedition at any other
time than that of the full Moon, therefore
they ſat ſtill and ſuffered their Enemies to
plunder and burn their Country, whilſt they
were fooliſhly expecting that period of the
Moon, which was moſt opportune and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to begin their defence in. But at laſt
they bethought themſelves and cried, <hi>There
is equal danger in the delay.</hi> The ſafety of
the Church is in danger, the Devil like a
ramping and a roaring Lyon goes about
ſeeking whom he may devour; ſimple
men are eaſily drawn into the ſnare, and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:99001:135"/>
tho they are very often touched with a
Zeal for God, yet out of Ignorance and
Miſperſwaſion, they perſecute the Son of
God: And as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> (ſaith, <hi>When they
think they are in Arms for Chriſt, they do
really fight againſt him.</hi> And the Biſhops
who ought in the firſt place to take care
of theſe things, either like vain Night-Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
throw every things into Diſorder and
Confuſion; or (that I may tell the truth
without diſguiſe) encreaſe the Errors, and
double the darkneſs. Now Sir, after all
this ſhould we have ſit ſtill and expected
the determination of theſe Fathers with
our Arms folded together, and doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing?
No, St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> (ſaith, <hi>There is but one
Epiſcopacy</hi> (in the whole Church) <hi>a ſolid
and intire part of which, is enjoyed by every
Biſhop: and every one ſhall ſurely give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to the Lord for his own part. Their
blood will I require at thy hand, ſaith the
Lord. And if any man puts his hand to the
Plough, and looketh back,</hi> and is ſolicitous
what others may think of him, and expects
the Authority of a General Council; and
in the mean time hides his Lords Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
he ſhall hear, <hi>thou ſloathful and wicked
Servant: Take him and caſt him into outer
darkneſs. Suffer</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>the dead to
bury their dead, but come thou and follow me.</hi>
The truth of God depends not upon men.
In Humane Counſels it is the part of a
wiſe man to ſtay for the judgment and
conſent of men; but in the Affairs of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:99001:136"/>
Religion, the voice of God ought to ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
the need of all others; which as ſoon
as a devout Soul has heard, he yeilds
preſently, ſubmits, and neither ſtands off,
nor expects any other; for he knows that
then he ought neither to believe the Pope
nor Council, but the Will of God thus
revealed. And this voice is to be obeyed,
tho oppoſed by all men. The Prophet
<hi>Elija</hi> immediately obeyed God, tho he did
believe that he was alone. <hi>Abraham</hi> upon
the Admonition of God went out of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,
Lot</hi> went out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the three
Children made a publick Confeſſion of
their Religion, and openly deteſted Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
without expecting a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.
<hi>Go out of her</hi> (ſaith the Angel) <hi>and be
not partakers of her ſins, that ye partake not
of her Plagues;</hi> he doth not ſay ſtay for a
Synod of the Biſhops. Thus the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
was at firſt publiſhed, and ſo it muſt
be now reſtored. The Apoſtles at firſt
taught the Goſpel without any publick
Council, and without any ſuch Council it
may now be called back, and reinſtated.
But if Chriſt himſelf or his Apoſtles in
the beginning would have delayed and
put off the whole buſineſs till a future
Council. <hi>When ſhould the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of them have
gone out into all Lands?</hi> How ſhould the
Kingdom of God have ſuffered force, and
the violent have taken it by a kind of
Invaſion? Where had the Goſpel now been?
Where would the Church of God have
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:99001:136"/>
been? In truth we neither fear nor fly
from a Council, but rather wiſh for and
deſire it, ſo it may be free, genuine,
and Chriſtian, and may be conven'd after
the pattern of that of the Apoſtles: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
that the Abbots and Biſhops may be
diſcharged of their Oath, by which they
are now bound to the <hi>Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> and
that whole Combination now on foot may
be diſſolved; provided thoſe of our Party
may be freely and modeſtly heard, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
they be not condemned before they
are heard: And laſtly upon condition that
if any thing be done, no one man may
weaken or reſcind all again. But now
whilſt we ſaw that the preſent manners
and times would not allow us thus much;
and that the moſt abſurd, ſilly, ridiculous,
ſuperſtitious, and wicked things were moſt
ſtifly defended, only becauſe they had been
heretofore received, and purely for cuſtom
ſake. We judged it to be our duty to
provide for, and take care of our own
Churches in a National Council.</p>
            <p>31. FOR we know that the Spirit of
God is neither bound to any place or
number of men. <hi>Tell it</hi> (ſaid Chriſt) <hi>to the
Church:</hi> To wit, not to the univerſal Church
which is ſpread all over the World, but to
the particular, which may meet in ſome
one place. <hi>Whereſoever</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>two or
three of you are gathered together in my Name,
there am I in the midſt of you.</hi> So St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
that he might reform the Churches of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:99001:137"/>
and <hi>Galatia,</hi> did not command them
to ſtay for a <hi>General Council,</hi> but wrote to
them that they would forthwith cut off all
Errors and Diſorders: And ſo heretofore
whilſt the Biſhops ſlept and did nothing,
or rather defil'd and polluted the Temple
of God, God by extraordinary ways ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
others who were great men, and of
generous minds, to reform whatever was
amiſs.</p>
            <p>32. BUT then, Sir, we have done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
raſhly, nor without very great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
nothing but what we ſaw was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
at all times to be done; and which
had often been done by the Holy Fathers
without any blame. And thus calling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
the Biſhops, and a very full Synod,
by the common conſent of all our <hi>States,</hi>
We cleanſed the Church of thoſe Dregs
and Corruptions which either the careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or malice of Men had brought in,
and purged it as the <hi>Augean</hi> Stable: And
as far as it was poſſible, we have reduced
all things to their ancient Splendor, and
the reſemblance of the Apoſtolical times,
and Primitive Church. And all this, as we
might lawfully do it, ſo for that cauſe have
we done it confidently.</p>
            <p>33. THAT which Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the
Firſt wrote about theſe Affairs pleaſe me;
and the more becauſe he wrote about the
Inſtitution of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Churches to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi>
Biſhop of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> He exhorts
him then, not that he ſhould refer things
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:99001:137"/>
to a Council, but that according to
his Diſcretion, he ſhould appoint ſuch
things as he ſaw did moſt tend to the
encreaſe of Piety. <hi>You know</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>my
Brother, the Cuſtom of the Church of</hi> Rome,
<hi>in which you were brought up; but I am beſt
pleaſed with this Courſe, that where-ever you
find any thing which is moſt pleaſing to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God, whether it be in the Church of</hi>
Rome, <hi>or that of</hi> France, <hi>or in any other
Church, you would carefully pick and chooſe
the principal things, and ſettle them in the
Church of</hi> England, <hi>which is yet new and
to be ſetled in the Faith, and that in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
thereof, you ſhould inſtill thoſe things
which you have thus collected from many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Churches <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> for Cuſtoms are not to be loved
for the ſake of the Places, but the Places for
their Sakes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>34. <hi>After the ſame manner the Fathers
in the Council of</hi> Conſtantinople <hi>wrote to</hi>
Damaſus <hi>Pope of</hi> Rome, <hi>and the reſt of the</hi>
Weſtern <hi>Biſhops.</hi> Ye know the ancient Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Definition of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> was
ever in force; that as to the Care of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of particular Churches, the Clergy
in every Province taking their Neighbours, if
they thought fit, ſhould confer Eccleſiaſtical
Dignities upon thoſe they believed would ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
them profitably. <hi>And the</hi> Affrican <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
wrote thus to Pope</hi> Celeſtinus. Your
Holineſs may be pleaſed to reject the unjuſt
Appeals or Recourſes of our Presbyters, and
the inferior Clerks of our Church, as becomes
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:99001:138"/>
you; for this was never denied to the Church
of <hi>Affrica</hi> by any Definition of the Fathers;
and the Decrees of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council have
moſt plainly committed both all inferiour Clerks,
and alſo all the Biſhops to their own Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litans:
for all Affairs may be moſt prudently
and juſtly ended in thoſe places where they
began, nor will the Grace and Aſſiſtance of
the Holy Ghoſt be wanting to any Province.
Let this Equity be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ver of great eſteem with
all Chriſtian Prieſts, which hath been conſtantly
retained.</p>
            <p>35. <hi>BUT</hi> Elutherius <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Rome
<hi>wrote much better, and more pertinently
to the thing we have now in hand in his
Epiſtle to</hi> Lucius, <hi>a King in</hi> Britain. You
have <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> deſired I would ſend you the
<hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Caeſarean</hi> Laws, which you have
a deſire to ſettle in your Kingdom of <hi>Britain:</hi>
We may abrogate the <hi>Roman</hi> and Imperial
Laws when we will, but not the Law of
God; for you have, by the Mercy of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Law and Faith of Chriſt in your
Kingdom of <hi>Britain;</hi> and you have with you
in your Kingdom both Teſtaments; compile out
of them, by the Aſſiſtance of God, and the
Counſel of your Kingdom, a Law, and then by
it, with Gods permiſſion, govern your ſaid
Kingdom, for you are the VICAR OF GOD
in that Kingdom, according to that of the
Pſalmiſt, the Earth is the Lords.</p>
            <p>36. IN ſhort, <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
held a Provincial Synod at <hi>Rome,</hi> and
<hi>Juſtinianus</hi> the Emperor commandeth, that
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:99001:138"/>
if need require, Synods ſhould be held in
each Province, and threatned, that if this
were neglected, he would puniſh thoſe
that made default. <hi>Every Province</hi> (ſaith
St. <hi>Jerome) hath its particular Manners, Rites
and Opinions, which cannot eaſily be removed
or changed without a very great diſturbance.</hi>
And why ſhould I commemorate the moſt

this is no new thing. So was the Church
of God governed before the Fathers met
in the Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> for they had not
preſently recourſe to a <hi>General Council. Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi>
held a <hi>Provincial</hi> Synod in <hi>Paleſtin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ious, Orthodox
and Chriſtian, tho the Pope had nothing
to do with them. For the Biſhops then, as
neceſſity required, and as things fell out,
preſently conſulted the Well-fare of their

implored the Aſſiſtance of their

aided each other without asking, and
if need were, did by turns help one the

a Capital Edict againſt all that ſhould
blaſpheme the God of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and <hi>David,
Solomon, Ezechias,</hi> and <hi>Joſias,</hi> who did part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
build, and partly reform the Temple of
God. <hi>Conſtantius</hi> the Emperor, without any
Council, took away the Worſhip of Idols,
and put forth a moſt ſevere Edict, by
which he made it capital for any man to
offer Sacrifice to any Idol. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the
Emperor, commanded all the Temples of
the Pagan Gods to be razed to the Ground.
<hi>Jovinianus,</hi> another of them, ſo ſoon as
ever he was declared Emperor, made his
firſt Law for the reſtitution of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Exiles. <hi>Juſtinianus was wont to ſay,
that his Care of the Chriſtian Religion was as
great as that of his Life. Joſhua,</hi> ſo ſoon
as ever he was made the Governour of
the People, had Precepts concerning Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and the Worſhip of God given him;
for Princes are the nurſing Fathers of the
Church, and the Keepers of both Tables;
nor was there any one Cauſe why God
ſetled Governments in the World greater
than this, <hi>viz. That there might be ſome to
preſerve Religion and Pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>37. AND therefore many Princes in
this Age do ſin the more grievouſly, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
call'd Chriſtians, ſit idely and enjoy their
Pleaſures, and tamely ſuffer wicked Rites of
Worſhip, and the Contempt of the Deity;
and turn over all this Care to the Biſhops,
and thoſe very Biſhops whom they know to
have all Religion in the utmoſt degree of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:99001:139"/>
ſcorn; as if the Care of the Churches and
People of God did not at all belong to them,
or as if they were meer Herds-men of Cattle,
and to take care of Bodies, but not in the
leaſt of mens Souls; they remember not in
the mean time, that they are the <hi>Miniſters of
God,</hi> and choſen for that purpoſe, that they
might <hi>ſerve the Lord. Ezechias</hi> the King
would not go up to his own Houſe until he
ſaw the Temple of God throughly purged.
And <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>I will not give Sleep to my
Eyes, no Slumber to my Eye-lids, until I find out
a Place for the Lord, a Tabernacle for the God of
Jacob.</hi> O that Chriſtian Princes would hear

that are Judges of the Earth. I have ſaid</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>that ye are Gods,</hi> that is, men di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely

and adorneſt thy own Houſe, how thou
canſt deſpiſe and neglect my Houſe; or how
thou canſt every day petition me, that I
would confirm thy Kingdom to thee and thy
Poſterity. What, that my Name may for
ever be treated unworthily? that the Goſpel
of my Chriſt may be extinguiſhed? that my
Servants may, for my Sake, he butchered
before thy Eyes, and in thy View? that this
Tyranny may rage the longer? that my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:99001:140"/>
Scandal may be confirm'd by thee? <hi>Wo to

by whom they are confirm'd. Thou trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt
at the Blood of Bodies, how much
more ſhouldeſt thou abhor the Blood of Souls?
remember what I did to <hi>Antiochus, Herod,</hi>
and <hi>Julian, I will tranſlate thy Kingdom unto thy
