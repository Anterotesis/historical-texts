         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

SPEECH
OF
Mr. Iames Guthrey,
LATE
Minister of STERLING.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Men and Brethren,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Fear many of you come hither to
gaze rather then to be edified by the
carriage and last words of a dying man,
but if any have an ear to hear, as I hope
some of this great Confluence have, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
your audience as to a few words: I am
come hither to lay down this earthly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
and mortal flesh of mine; and <hi>I</hi>
bless God <hi>I</hi> do it willingly, and not by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint,
<hi>I</hi> say I suffer willinglie, if I had
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47328:3"/>
been otherwise minded I might have made
a diversion, and not been a prisoner, but
I being conscious to my self of nothing
worthy of death or bonds, I would not
stain my conscience with the suspicion of
guiltiness by my withdrawing. Neither
have I wanted opportunity nor advantages
to escape since I was a Prisoner: Not by
the fault of my Keeper, God knows, but
otherwife. But neither for this had I light
or liberty, least I should reflect upon
the Lords Name, and offend the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Righteous.</p>
            <p>And if these men have not been mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
or dealt deceitfullie in telling me so,
I might have avoiced, not onlie the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
of the Sentence, but also had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and countenance by complying
with the course of the times: But durst not
redeem my Life with the loss of my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity,
God knows I durst not.</p>
            <p>And that since I was a Prisoner the
Lord hath so held me by the hand, that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47328:3"/>
he never suffered me to bring to debate
in my inward thoughts, muchless to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
or hearken to any Overtures in that
kind.</p>
            <p>I did judge it better to suffer then to
sin, and therefore I am come hither to laie
down my life this day, and I bless God I
die not as a Fool, not that I have any thing
wherein to glorie in my self: I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
I am a Sinner, yea one of the vilest
and greatest that hath owned a profession
of Religion, and one of the most unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest
that hath preached the Gospel, my
Corruptions have been strong and manie
and hath made me a sinner even in all
things, yea even in following my Dutie:
And therefore righteousness have I none
of my own, but I do beleive that Iesus
Christ came into the World to save sinners
whereof I am the chief, through faith in
his righteousness and blood, have I obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
mercie, and in him and through him
alone have I the hope of a blessed conquest
and victorie over sin and satan, and hell
and death, and that I shall attain unto the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47328:4"/>
Resurrection of the just and be made a
pertaker of eternal life, I know whom I
have beleived, and he is able to keep that
which I have committed to him against
that day.</p>
            <p>I have preached Salvation through his
name, and as I have Preached so I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
and do commend the riches of
his free grace and faith in his blood unto
you all, as the onely way whereby you can
besaved, and I bless God as I die not as
a fool, so also I die not for evil doing, not
a few of you may hapily judge that I suffer
as a Thief, or as a Murderer, as an evil
Doer, or as a busie-body in other mens
matters, that was the lot of our Lord
Jesus Christ himself, and hath been the
lot of many of his precious people and
servants, to suffer by the World as evil
doers, and as my soul stirs not at that, but
desires to rejoyce in being in conformity to
my blessed head, and so blessed a company
in these things, so do I desire in prayer that
I may be to none of you to day on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
a stone of stumbling, or a Rock of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:47328:4"/>Blessed is he that will not be offended in Christ,
and his poor servants, because of their being
condemned as evil doers by the World, God
is my record that in these things for which sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of death hath passed against me, I have a
good Conscience, I bless God they are not mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Compliance with the Sectaries, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes
and practices against his Majesties person,
or Government, or the Person or Government
of his Royal Father, my heart I bless God is
Conscious of no disloyalty, nay Loyal I have
been, and commend it to you all, to be Loyal
and Obedient unto the King, true piety is the
foundation of true loyalty, a Wicked man may
be a flatterer, and a time server, but he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be a loyal Subject, but to return to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
            <p>Matters, for which I am condemned, are
matters belonging to my calling and function,
as a Minister of the Gospel, such as the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
and reproof of sin, and pressing the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fast the Oath of God and the Covenant,
in preserving and carrying on the work of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and Reformation, according thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and denying to acknowledg the civil
Magestrate to be the competent Judge in
matters Ecclesiastical, that in all these things
which God so ordering by his gracious provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
are the ground of my sentence and death,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47328:5"/>
I have a good conscience, as having walked there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
according to the light and rule of Gods word,
as doth become a Minister of the Gospel. I do
also bless the Lord that I do not dye as one
not desired, I know that of not a few I have
never been nor am desired: It hath been my lot
to have been a man of contention and sorrow:
but it is my comfort that for my own things I
have not contended, but for the things of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, and for what relates to his Interest
and Work, and well being of his people, in
order to the preserving and promoting of
these I did protest against, and stood in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to those Assemblies at St. <hi>Andrews,</hi>
and <hi>Dundee,</hi> and <hi>Edenburg,</hi> and the publique
resolution of bringing the <hi>Malignant</hi> party to
judicature, and Armies of this Kingdom, as
conceiving the same contrary to the Word of
God, and to our Solemn Covenant, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,
and to be an inlet to defection,
and to the ruine and destruction of the Work
of God, as it is now manifest to this day to
mens Consciences. I have not therein been
mistaken, and was not fighting against the man
of straw, I was also desirous to have some
poor Indeavour, to have the Church of God
purged from insufficient, scandalous, and corrupt
Ministers and Elders.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:47328:5"/>For these things, I have been mistaken by some, and
hated by others: but I blesse the Lord, as I had the
testimony of my own conscience, I am there in a appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
and in the conscience of many of the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and precious servants, and how little soever I
may dye not desired by some, yet by these I know I
dye desired, and their approbation is of more value to
me then all the contradictions and reproaches of the
other: I doe with all my heart forgive them, and
wherein I have offended any of them I doe beg their
mercy and forgivenesse, and doe from my soul wish
that my death may be profitable unto both, that the one
may be confirmed in the sweet way of the Lord, and
that the other (if the Lord will) may be convinced,
and cease from those things that are not good, and doe
not edifie. But yet there is one thing I would warne
you all of, that God is wroth, yea very wroth with
<hi>Scotland</hi> and threatens to depart and remove his can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlestick.
The Causes of his wroth are many, and would
to God that were not one great cause, that the causes
of his wroth are despis'd and rejected by a great many.
Consider that case that is recorded <hi>Ier.</hi> 26. and the
consequence of it, and tremble and fear. I cannot
but also say, there is a great increase of wroth by the
deluge of prophanity that overflowes the Land, and
hath reins loosed unto it every where; in so far that
many have lost not only the use and exercise of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but even morallity and common civillity, that is
to be found even among heathen.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The horrible treachery and perjury that
is in the matter of the Covenant and Cause of God,
and work of reformation: Be astonished ye Heavens
at this, shall the people break the Covenant and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper,
saith the Lord? Shall the Throne of iniquity
have fellowship with God, which frameth mischiefe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47328:6"/>
by a Law. I fear the Lord is about to bring a Sword on
this Land, which shall aveng the Covenant.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Horrible Ingratitude after ten years op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
and bondage. He hath broken the yoak of
Strangers from off your necks, but what doe we render
unto the Lord for all his kindnesse? Most of the fruit
of our deliverance is to work wickednesse and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
our selves to doe evill.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Most fearfull Idolatry and sacrificing to
the creature. We have changed the glory of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible
God into the Image of a corruptible man,
in whom many have placed almost all their salvation
and desires, and have turned that which might have
been a blessing unto us (being kept into a due subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
unto God) into an Idol of jealousie, by prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it before him.</p>
            <p>5. God is also wroth with a corrupt and carnal ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of corrupt and carnal time-serving Ministers;
I know and bear Testimony, there is your true and
faithful Ministers; blessed be God, we have yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
who study their duty, and desire to be found faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
unto the Lord; and I pray you to Honour, Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and Esteem much of those for their Work sake;
&amp; I pray them to be encouraged in their Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
who is with them, to make them an Iron Pillar,
and Brazen Wall, and a strong Defenced City, in
their faithful following of their Duty: But O that there
were not too many that minde Earthly things, that are
enemies to the Cross of Christ, who push with the
side and shoulder, who strengthen the hand of evil
Doers, who make themselves Transgressors, by stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying
to build what formerly they did destroy, I mean
Prelacy, and the Service Book, and the Mysterie of
Iniquity that works on us, whose steps lead us to the
House of the great Whore, and Mother of Fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47328:6"/>
and whoever he be that builds this <hi>Iericho,</hi> let
him take heed of that Curse of the Flying Rowle
mentioned in <hi>Zach.</hi> 5. and let all Ministers take heed
that they walk and be stedfast in the Faith, and quit
themselves, and be strong, and give seasonable warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
concerning sin and Duty: Many of the Lord's
people do sadly complain of the fainting and silence of
many Watchmen; and it concerns them to consider
what God calls for at their hand in such a day; Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
now in a Watchman, now when he is called to
speak, and to give his Testimony on the peril of his
life, is doubtless a great sin: The Lord open the
mouths of his Servants to speak his Word with all
boldness; That Covenant-breaking may be discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and reproved, and that the Kingdome of Christ
may not be supplanted, nor the souls of his people be
destroyed without a Warning. I have but a few words
more to adde; All that are prophane among you, I
<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>xhort to Repentance; for the day of the Lord's
wrath hastneth, and is neer; but there is yet a Door
of mercy opened unto you, if you will not despise
the day of salvation. All you that are Malignant, and
Reproachers of Godliness, and of such as live godly,
take heed what you do; it will be a hard matter for
you to kick against pricks; you make your selves the
Buts of the Lord's fury and flaming Indignation, if
you do not cease, and repent of your Ungodly deeds:
All that are Neuters, <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Indifferent Luke-warm Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors,
be zealous, lest the Lord spew you out of his
mouth. And you that repent for all the abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that are done in the City, and in the Land, and
that take pleasure in the stones and dust of Zion, cast
not away your confidence, but be comforted and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
in the Lord, he will yet appear for your
joy; God hath not cast away his people and work in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47328:7"/>
               <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> I hope it shall once appear and
revive by the power of his Spirit, and take root down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and bring forth plentiful fruit upward; there is
yet a holy Seed, a Root whom God will preserve, and
bring forth; but how long and dark our night may be,
I do not know; The Lord shorten it for the sake of
his Chosen. In the mean time be you patient and
immoveable, abounding in the work of the Lord, and
in love one to another: Beware of Snares, which are
strowed thick; Cleave unto the Covenant, and Work
of Reformation; Do not decline the Cross of Christ;
Chuse rather to suffer affliction with the people of
God, then to enjoy the pleasure of sin for a season;
and account the reproaches of the Lord greater riches
then all the Treasures of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Let my death
grieve none of you, it will be more profitable and
advantagious both for me and you, and for the Church
of God, and for Christ's Interest, then my life
could have been; I Forgive all men the Guilt
of it, and desire you to do so also: Pray for
them that persecute you, Bless them that Curse you,
Bless I say, and Curse not.</p>
            <p>I dye in the Faith of the Apostles and Primitive
Christians and Protestant Reformed Church, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
that Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whereof I am a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and Minister, and bear my Testimony and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to the Doctrine and Discipline of the Church
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by Assemblies, Synod, Presbyteries,
and Societies; Popery, Prelacy, and also their Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
of Service and Ceremony I doe abhor, and bear
my witnessing unto the National Covenant in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
Solemn League between the three Kingdomes; the
Sacred Solemn and Publick Oath of God I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
can be loosed by or dispensed with by any Person
or Power, or any one on earth, but are still binding
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47328:7"/>
on these Nations, and will be for ever hereafter, and
are Ratified and sealed by the Conversion of many
thousand Souls since our entring therein: I bear my
witnesse unto the Protestation against the Contravert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Assembly and their publick Resolution. To the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
given against the Sectaries. Against that course of
defection that is now in the Land, and all the branches
thereof in that.</p>
            <p>In the last place I bear my witnesse to the Crosse of
Christ, and that I had never cause, nor have cause this
day to repent of any thing I have suffered or can suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
for his Name; and I take God to Record upon my
Soul, I would not exchange this Scaffold with the
fairest Palace or Miter of the Greatest Prelate; bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
be God who hath shewed Mercy unto such a
Wretch, and hath revealed his Son unto me, and made
me a Minister of the Everlasting Gospel, that he hath
dignified me in the midst of much Contradiction from
Sathan and the World, to fulfill my Ministry on the
hearts of not a few of his People, especially in the
Stage wherein I last was, I mean the Congregation of
the Presbyterie of <hi>Sterling,</hi> God forgive that poor
vain empty man that did there Intrude my labour, and
hath made a prey of many poor Souls, and hath expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
others to reproach, and oppression, and a famine
of the Word of the Lord, God forgive that mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leader
of the poor People, who tempted them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
their alone Minister; the Father of Mercy pitty
that poor mislead people, and the Lord direct the
Congregations and Presbyteries of <hi>Scotland</hi> once
more with faithfull Pastors, and grant that the Work
of the Lord may be revived through all <hi>Brittain</hi> and
over all the World: Christ is my Light and my Life,
my Righteousnesse, my Strength, and my Salvation, he
is also my Salvation and all my desire is in him; I doe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47328:8"/>
with all the strength of my Soul commend him to you:
Blessed are they that are not offended in him; Blesse
him O my Soul from henceforth, and for ever rejoyce,
rejoyce, yea rejoyce all that love him, be patient and
rejoyce in Tribulation; blessed are ye, and blessed
shall you be for ever, and everlasting love and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Salvation is yours, all are yours, ye are Christs,
and Christ is Gods.</p>
            <p>Remember me O Lord with the favour thou bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
to thy one People, direct me with thy salvation,
that I may see the good of thy chosen therein, that
I may rejoyce with the gladnesse of thy Nation, that
I may glory with thy Inheritance; now let thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
depart in peace, since my eyes have seen thy
Salvation.</p>
