         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
Hearty Concurrence of divers Citizens and Inhabitants of the City of <hi>London;</hi> with the Miniſters
of the Province thereof, to their Teſtimony to the Truth of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and to our Solemne
<hi>LEAGUE</hi> and <hi>COVENANT.</hi>
As alſo againſt the Errours, Hereſies, and Blaſphemies of theſe times, and the Tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of them.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Ineſtimable value of Truth which undeniably claimes God the Father to be the Authour, Jeſus Chriſt the Purchaſer, and the Holy
Spirit of God the revealer of it, the zealous practices of the faithfull witneſſes of Jeſus Chriſt in former ages oppoſing errours by their
valiant ſealing to the truth with their blood, the painfull preaching pious practices, and learned writings of our late faithfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
now with God: As Mr. <hi>Egerton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Stocke,</hi> Mr. <hi>Randal,</hi> Doctor <hi>Sibs,</hi> Dr. <hi>Preſton,</hi> Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> Dr. <hi>Stoughton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Elton,</hi> with many
others, together with our preſent vigilant Spirituall watchmen in the Province of <hi>London,</hi> honoured in being the firſt which brake the
Ice in their zealous contention for truth againſt errour when it was higheſt, themſelves (we hope) at loweſt; Together with the faithfull
Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt in the Counties of <hi>Warwicke, Gloceſter,</hi> and that heart-warming harmonious conſent of the Miniſters of the
County of <hi>Lancaſter;</hi> And, the ſerious conſideration of the moſt obſerveable acts of Gods grace to this City, as well of old, as of
later dayes; our late afflictions, diſhonours, and reproaches caſt upon us for our neutrality, lukewarmneſſe, formality, the cloud of bloud
ſtill hanging over our heads, the ſparkles of Gods wrath ſcattered amongſt us, the fearefull frownes of our juſtly angry God againſt us, manifeſted in ſeverall
ſymptomes: Laſtly, that wee in our places might contribute ſomething wherein we might the more firmely ingage our ſelves to the truth, incourage the truly
godly, recover ſome which are miſled, ſtrengthen them who are ready to fall, fill the faces of Heretiques, prophane perſons, lukewarme Pollititians with
ſhame (that ſo they might ſeeke the face of God in Jeſus Chriſt) advance Covenanted Reformation; And, which is not the leaſt, our conſciouſneſſe of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
duty lying upon us, being as fire in our bowells, ſo that we can no longer forbeare, leſt God ſpew us out of his mouth, and wee be a reproach to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell;
The deepe and due conſideration of theſe and many other ſuch like weighty incitations doe moſt ſeriouſly put us upon this worke to imitate our
faithfull Paſtors in contending for Truth againſt Errour; for piety againſt prophaneneſſe, and for our Solemne League and Covenant againſt all oppoſers in
theſe few enſuing particulars.</p>
            <p>I. Wee teſtifie to all the World, That it is the earneſt deſires of our ſoules that the humble advice of the Aſſembly of Divines by Authority of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſitting at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> concerning the Confeſſion of Faith, abundantly ſatisfactory to us, for its purity, ſollidity, and conformity to the holy Scriptures,
the two Catechiſmes both the larger and leſſer may bee eſtabliſhed among us by Civill ſanction, with the Church-Government.</p>
            <p>II. Wee doe hereby alſo declare againſt all thoſe unſound Opinions, Errours, Hereſies, and Blaſphemies, already enumerated by our godly Paſtors in their
Teſtimony: As alſo ſome others ſince publiſhed,<note n="a" place="margin">A Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to an approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>per Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua Sprig,</hi> Pag. 65.</note> 
               <hi>viz. That while we are weake we know not the love of the Father to us; But thinke that Jeſus Chriſt doth procure the
love of the Father; when as Jeſus Chriſt doth but manifeſt and declare the love of the Father.</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">The life of Chriſt Printed 1648. p. 2.</note> Another, <hi>That Chriſt is not borne of the bloud of</hi> Adam, <hi>but from Heaven.</hi>
All which Tenets wee looke upon as contrary to the Analogie of Faith, and paterne of ſound words; and therefore with the Miniſters that are gone
before us, Wee doe teſtifie and declare our utter diſlike of Anabaptiſme, Browniſme, Erraſtianiſme, Independencie, and Prelacie; ſo alſo our ſoules
abhorrencie and vehement deteſtation of Antiſcripturiſme, Socinianiſme, Arminianiſme, Arrianiſme, Antinomianiſme, Popery, and Antitrinitarianiſme,
with many others.</p>
            <p>III. Wee deſire to expreſſe our hearty ſorrow for, and deteſtation of all thoſe graceleſſe cauſes, and ungodly practices of theſe Apoſtatizing times, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
ſwearing, drunkenneſſe, Sabbath-breaking, oppreſſion, which are God-provoking, and Kingdome-deſtroying abominations, not to be named amongſt
Chriſtians: All that oppoſition to Reformation, hypocriticall purſuing of falſe intereſts under ſpecious pretences of publique good, all which are againſt
piety towards God, Juſtice, Righteouſneſſe and Sobriety towards men, laying us naked to Divine vengeance, and rendering us a people fitted for deſtruction,
therefore we deſire to be ſenſible of theſe provocations, and to ſtir up our ſelves, and all the godly in this Kingdome to diſclaime againſt them, and endeavour
in their and our places to reforme them according to our Covenant.</p>
            <p>IV. Our diſlike ſhall we ſay? That's too little, nay rather our deteſtation of that wicked deſign of the Sectarian prophane party, who endeavour to extirpate
and
expell from amongſt us, our learned, godly, and conſcientious Miniſters, declaiming againſt their perſons by uncivill ſcoffes, and againſt their Calling as
Antichriſtian, and by detaining not onely a plentifull, but even a competent maintenance, under pretence of unlawfulneſſe of tythes, which makes us invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
the Lord, that they may never have power to accompliſh this execrable deſigne, nor we have cauſe ſadly to ſigh, and ſay, our Teachers are removed into
corners.</p>
            <p>V. Wee declare our hearty deſires, That the Government of Jeſus Chriſt (according to our Covenant, and the advice of the Aſſembly of Divines) may bee
eſtabliſhed amongſt us, a taſte whereof in that little part of it which is ſet up amongſt us, we looke not upon as Arbitrary and Tyrannicall, yea to have it
compleated would be our Glory and Crowne of rejoycing; utterly diſliking the oppoſition it meets withall: And, oh that we knew what to do for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
that oppoſition by looſe and prophane perſons on the one hand, and on the other by ſuch as ſeparate, and highly contend for that Great; <hi>Diana</hi> the
<hi>Compendium</hi> of all miſchiefes concentred in that one word, <hi>Toleration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VI. Laſtly, but not leaſt of all, as for the Covenant, our Solemne League and Covenant, as we heartily rejoyce that wee tooke it, that it was commended to
the Kingdome by the Parliament, and taken by ſo many in both Kingdomes with their hands lifted up to Heaven, ſo alſo we deſire to be afflicted in our ſoules
with ſhame and ſorrow for the violation of it, either by our ſelves or others, but moſt of all for that ſtupendious wickedneſſe and matchleſſe impiety in
villifying and contemning that Sacred Oath, even by too too many that entered into it and covenanted with us; doubtleſſe that faithfull God who keepeth
Covenant with us, will avenge the quarrell of this Covenant broken by us, unleſſe prevented by Repentance and Reformation: And as we look upon it as a duty
belonging to all to take it, and therefore blame the non-taking of it by any; ſo we declare our utter diſlike of the ſlighters and contemners of it, and earneſtly
deſire the taking of it by all, be not onely commended, but commanded by Authority.</p>
            <p>As for our ſelves, it is our deſire, and ſhall be our conſtant endeavours in the ſtrength of Jeſus Chriſt, maugre all malice and oppoſition whatſoever, to keep
it, and to purſue all the ends contained in it, in the plaine, literall, grammaticall ſenſe of it, in the which we then tooke it, abominating all other gloſſes upon
it, and doe with the Miniſters of <hi>London,</hi> and elſewhere, declare that we beleeve in our conſciences, no power on earth whatſoever can abſolve us from the bond
of that Covenant.</p>
            <p>In Teſtimony whereof, as in the preſence of the Lord, in the integrity of our hearts we hereunto ſubſcribe our names.</p>
