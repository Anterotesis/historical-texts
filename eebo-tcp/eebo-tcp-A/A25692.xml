            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have now read the second part of the <hi>Rehearsal Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosed,</hi> which you so earnestly recommend to me in your last: And am very sorry to see that the difference between those ingenious men is inflamed to this height; and that the Controversie should be so far run out into matters of personal abuse. I shall not tell you at this
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65193:3"/>
time who I think hath the better in the argument; This is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, That <hi>M. M.</hi> hath much the advantage in the <hi>Reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> part. For though I confidently believe that his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary is clear, as to the soul things laid to his charge by this Author; Yet He is a Clergy man, and it is not enough for them to be innocent, while there are any who have the ill-will to accuse them; and such there will be, while there are <hi>Sects,</hi> and Jovial <hi>Atheists</hi> in the world. I have nothing to say in particular of the personal matters; only this I will adventure to observe; That I think you do amiss in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving so great a prejudice against the Authour of the <hi>E. P.</hi> from those <hi>uncertain,</hi> if not <hi>untrue</hi> things, which his heated Antagonist hath said of Him. You know it is a great piece of Injustice to entertain Reports hastily of any man, and especially of the Ministers of Religion, whom so many take pleasure to defame, either out of design to disgrace their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, or to excuse, and extenuate their own vileness by it. And I intreat you to consider that there may be such a concurrence of unhappy circumstances upon a Clergy-man, that is very vertuous, and very Innocent, as may render him exceedingly obnoxious in the opinion of those that have <hi>none,</hi> or but a <hi>slight knowledge</hi> of him. I shall recite some of those circumstances, which I believe may come pretty near the present Case, and which concern some others (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this Learned, and Ingenious Gentleman,) for whom you profess to have affection, and esteem.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Then, when a Divine hath any different apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions from common Thoughts, though but in <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and speculation; Yet this alone shall prepare dislike and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindness for him in some, who will be apt presently to judge him a conceited, and phantastick Affector of <hi>Novelties,</hi> though he be never so unlike that character; and this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice disposeth them to receive with gladness, any report to his disadvantage.</p>
            <p>But if he step out of the road in <hi>Theological</hi> matters, and dare dissent from the usual systemes in any of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies of Religion: If he contradict any opinion they have taught, or defend any Article of Truth in a way which they
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65193:3"/>
have not heard; or if these things are but said, or suspected of him; it shall be enough to render him first a <hi>strange</hi> man in their thoughts; and after that, any Monster that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of his enemies shall paint Him like.</p>
            <p>If ithappen, over and above this, that he falls into pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Controversie with any presum'd Orthodox man of note, what ever the Cause be, what ever reason, and justice he may have on his side, 'tis odds but he shall receive a blot from the contest; And though he should write nothing but De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations, and his adversary nothing but absurdities; Though he shamefully baffle, and confute him in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all ingenious, and impartial men; Yet 'tis all one, The supposed Orthodox Disputer shall triumph among his common easie Admirers, while his Antagonist shall be hang'd and drawn, unheard and unknown: And whatever the other affirms of him in Corners, shall spread and sound, and beget him prejudice, and distastes, though it be never so false, or unlikely.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If this Clergy-man be one that sets himself with ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, and successful zeal to detect and reprove the sins, and follies of any popular <hi>Sects</hi> of Religion; If he speak out with courage, and Resolution, and shame their darling va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, either from the Press, or from the Pulpit; He then raiseth upon himself the most angry Nest of Hornets in the world; and must look to be persecuted with their noise and stings without mercy, and without end. For if the most wary and silent of the Conforming Clergy, who offend them not, are stigmatized by many of them as <hi>prophane</hi> and <hi>ignorant</hi> men; If <hi>they</hi> can scarce escape the imputation of being Drunkards, and debauch't persons, and are sure to be accounted, (at the best) <hi>strangers,</hi> if not <hi>enemies</hi> to the Life and power of Religion, and the Mysteries of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel: What then must be their portion, who openly, and impartially set themselves to disgrace their beloved phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies? Certainly there is no mans reputation (be he never so innocent) that can stand before <hi>such</hi> and <hi>so many</hi> ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies as this freedom of necessary and just reproof will raise upon him: every Word he speaks shall be rack't, and every
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65193:4"/>
Action he doth shall be canvast, and both examin'd with all the Criticisme of subtle malice, till some scandalous matter be extorted from them to furnish out reproachful stories: And <hi>these</hi> when they are up, will run, and spread like Fire in a train of Gun-powder. The inraged Parties are pleased, and tickled at the heart by them; They never inquire into their truth, or falshood: 'Tis <hi>convenient</hi> that ill things be said, and believ'd of those Enemies of Godliness, (as they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count all whom they reckon <hi>theirs)</hi> And therefore they blow those leud Tales about with all the pleasure of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and all the zeal of ignorance and ill-will: And there are people every where, who are prepared, and ready to give hearty welcome to any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oul story of a conforming Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister: For ye know how every corner of the Land abounds with Enemies of the Church, and all that adhere unto it: so that they have the wind, and are Masters of fame; and when they set on it can blast the cle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rest Innocence under Heavens; and set on it they will, when they are confronted, and exposed by just, and smart R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>prehensions. So that there was scarce ever any man that dealt roundly and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly with them, but came away loaded with the dirt of their dung-hills; and more, or less, infected with the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their breath.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If this Church-man be wont to reprehend the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Wit,</hi> and <hi>Wits</hi> of the Age, with spirit and smartness, and endeavour to render the <hi>Drollers</hi> and Buffoons odious, and contemptible, as they deserve; If he be sharp, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in reproving and exposing the concomitant <hi>Atheism,</hi> and vile humour of deriding Religion and things Sacred; He then draws the <hi>Railers,</hi> and <hi>Jesters</hi> upon his back, who will put a thousand tricks upon him, and persecute him with their scoffs in all companies, and make him the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant mark of their malicious sport.</p>
            <p>Now You know Sir, what a <hi>taking</hi> sort of people these are in our times, and how far this fooling will go with some to render those contemptible in their esteem, that deserve better thoughts of them. There is much malice in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, which this humour gratifyeth, when it exposeth any
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65193:4"/>
mans name to scorn and laughter; especially it is tickled when any of the Clergy are derided: So that no worth, no vertue, no Accomplishments are sence against this set of men: Yea the more eminent any of these are, the more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to such wrongs, and the more the common Envy makes such abuses spread. For even the Sects that pretend to the greatest seriousness and gravity of humour are trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with the wit, that aims at making the <hi>Sons</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> ridiculous, especially when it falls on those who have been so hardy as to declare against their dear follies, and fall on them it shall, while there are Buffoons to be hired for that service.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If the Minister useth to be close and pungent upon the great <hi>Debauchees</hi> of the Age, and endeavours by any more than ordinary earnestness, and power of reproof to make them despicable, and vile in the eyes and thoughts of all men:</p>
            <p>If besides this in general, he chance to incurr the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ill-will and displeasure of any one, or more of them, (though <hi>innocently,</hi> and without giving just ground of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence) He must expect the utmost of their rage. They will toss his name about in every Ale-house and Tavern; and make Him their constant subject, and their <hi>Song.</hi> They will inflame all their company, and acquaintance against him, and make it a great entertainment of their meetings to raise odious stories of him, which they will publish in all their neighbourhoods, and so blacken him, as if he were a <hi>Devil,</hi> though he be the most innocent person breathing. They will propagate and improve all the slanders that have been raised on him by his <hi>Fan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tick</hi> Adversaries; And <hi>they</hi> again entertain and spread all those that are invented by <hi>these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched</hi> ones; and so between the one and the other, they will make him appear as a very vile<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and odious person, be he never so vertuous and unblameable in his conversation.</p>
            <p>Thus an innocent man that doth nothing but his Duty, may by it draw all the <hi>worst</hi> sort of Enemies upon him: And if he be a person <hi>free,</hi> and <hi>open</hi> in speaking of his mind, and not pharisaical and superstitious in his actions (though
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65193:5"/>
never so honest and harmless in them) Such openness, and unaffected freedom affords matter and occasion to the malice of those that lye in wait for him; and makes way for the belief of the ill things they injuriously fasten upon his name. And if to all the rest this be added, That he be a person not inclined to converse much in common companies, or to make friends by such Conversations; If he be intimately known but to a few, and only superficially and by hearsays, to others, the slanderous tales raised upon him shall spread with so much the less stop, or contradiction. When <hi>these unhappy Circumstances</hi> meet in any person, he will certainly be defamed and run down, though he have the <hi>piety</hi> of a <hi>Saint,</hi> and the <hi>Innocency</hi> of a <hi>Chrysome Infant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now the usual Scandals that such Enemies endeavour to fasten on the Clergy are, those of <hi>Drinking,</hi> and <hi>Women.</hi> For the <hi>first,</hi> they ordinarily fix it upon the merry men, who are of the humour for Company, and common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation: But as for those who seldom or never go into publick Houses, nor are any way disposed to the jollity of the boon-Companions, They have no colour nor occasion to lay the reproach of <hi>Drinking</hi> upon them: And therefore the <hi>Other</hi> must be their Portion. For that is a sort of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation that will bear upon any man; and 'tis <hi>such,</hi> as one cannot well stir in for his vindication. 'Tis a scandal that renders the person most vile among the more sober, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, and affords most matter for the malicious merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and sport of his prophane and Atheistical Enemies: And therefore if he be a single-man, If he now and then be in Company with those of the other Sex, and be spoken well of by any of them: These shall then be ground and matter for the plot; and many Scenes of scandal and abuse shall continually be made out of it.</p>
            <p>And now Sir, if you reflect on the recited particulars, and mind that they have been the <hi>Circumstances</hi> of some <hi>innocent</hi> persons of your acquaintance, and will but be so just as to consider how many of them concur in the present case, You will see that you ought not hastily to believe the foul Stories put upon the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Ecclesiastical Policy,</hi> nor the like
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65193:5"/>
of any other Clergy-man, that is under such Circumstances as those. And I beseech you to call to mind how much our Religion obligeth us to practise candour, and charity in our judging one another, and how much we may need it our selves. You know who tells us that <hi>Charity thinketh no evil; It suffereth long and is kind; is not easily provoked; rejoyceth not in Iniquity; viz.</hi> It is not willing to hear, or entertain reproaches of ones Neighbours; It hath no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in them; It judgeth by the Rules of kindness, and love, which covers multitudes of evils, and beareth long before it be incensed by defaming stories. According to such measures a Christian ought to govern his thoughts, and speeches of every private person: But especially Charity and many other Considerations will require it from him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the <hi>Clergy.</hi> The malice of men makes them usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally glad at heart to hear evil of their Brother. This pleaseth the envious humour, and is a kind of set off to those that pride themselves in not being guilty of such Crimes; and serves to lessen the faults they have, (in their own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, at least,) and so pleaseth exceedingly in the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: But this malice and readiness to calumniate is not so eager, and severe upon any as the <hi>Clergy,</hi> especially in <hi>this Age,</hi> in which they are so contemn'd, and worried by the <hi>Atheists,</hi> and <hi>prophane</hi> on the one hand; and by the <hi>Papists,</hi> and <hi>Sects</hi> on the other. This ought to be remembred, and suspence to be held on our belief on Consideration of it, till the evidence be notorious; And then too, men ought not to be forward to publish the shame of such persons, in whose esteem the honour, and interests of Religion, are so much concern'd. On which account a scandal upon one of the <hi>sacred</hi> function is more pernicious, than in other cases, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thereby the mouths of the Atheists, and prophane are opened against the whole Profession, if not against the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of it. And the effect of his Ministry is obstructed as to others, who else might have received much benefit from his Labours. So that every good Christian ought to have tenderness for the reputation of the Clergy; And the want of it among us, is perhaps one of the greatest scandals

of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and that which hath been an unhappy hinderance to the Reverence and propagation of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Religion it prof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But I need not insist on this, in writing to one, whose own thoughts can furnish him with plenty of Reasons against this disingenuous Practice: Only give me leave to add, That to slander and abuse <hi>Those</hi> of <hi>this Coat</hi> is a <hi>Cowardly</hi> and <hi>ungentlemanly</hi> kind of baseness. For the <hi>Clergy</hi> are a sort of <hi>naked,</hi> disarmed men, that have no Defence but their <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,</hi> and the <hi>sacredness</hi> of their profession; And <hi>this</hi> hath been protection to them, amidst the rudeness of the most <hi>barbarous</hi> N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tions: For the most bruitish Indians would not offer any sort of violence to the <hi>Priesthood;</hi> and <hi>respect</hi> to this Order seems to have been an universal acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Mankind: So that to fall on <hi>These,</hi> on every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and without any, and to tear their <hi>Names</hi> (the <hi>dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi> part of them) by malicious <hi>falshoods,</hi> and abuses, is <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous</hi> beyond the <hi>ferity</hi> of <hi>Cannibals.</hi> And 'tis certainly a very <hi>ungentlemanly</hi> practice; It being like fighting with women, or assaulting one whose hands are bound, and hath not the Liberty of defending, or righting himself in the wayes that are common to the rest of men: so that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks none but the most <hi>rascal</hi> spirits, and <hi>infamous Cowards</hi> should be guilty of this baseness.</p>
            <p>I thus lightly pass over these R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>flections, in which I doubt not but I have your concurrence, and come to a passage of your Letter, in which I differ from your opinion.</p>
            <p>You would have the Author of the <hi>E. P.</hi> to refute, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove those things of <hi>Immorality</hi> which his Adversary chargeth on him; and you think if he be guiltless, he owes himself and his Profession this right.</p>
            <p>For my part I verily believe him <hi>innocent;</hi> But yet, if I were fit to be consulted, I should by no means advise his writing any particular vindication: The things are too soul to be touch't by his hands, and such spots are better worn out by time and patience, than wiped off by hasty Zeal of Reputation. Dirt while it is green will not be struck off clear, but the very <hi>wiping</hi> of it fastens some stain, and spreads
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65193:6"/>
it further: Industrious <hi>Apologies,</hi> in such cases, beget suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and raise more scandal: And 'tis a scandalous thing to have so much <hi>appearance</hi> of <hi>guilt,</hi> as to <hi>seem greatly concerned</hi> to clear ones Innocence; such lewd Reproaches will dye of themselves when they are let alone, and despised; but they are revived, and kept alive by much ado of answering, and refuting: The best way for any man to confute a slander, is to do it by the greater <hi>strictness</hi> of his <hi>Life:</hi> And if I was to counsel any Clergy man that was faln under such cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of misfortune, I'le tell you how I would Advise.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) I would perswade him to examine strictly, what occasion he may have given by any <hi>appearance</hi> of the vices with which he is reproach'd. 'Tis not sufficient for the Clergy to <hi>avoid evil,</hi> but they must <hi>stand off</hi> out of the <hi>sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow</hi> of it. Many things are <hi>lawful</hi> and harmless, that yet are not <hi>expedient,</hi> especially for men of sacred Character: And therefore if such a one find, that though his <hi>Conscience</hi> be clear, yet his <hi>prudence</hi> hath been defective; and that he hath not been enough cautelous, and watchful in the midst of so many enemies; He ought to blame his own unwari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and to resolve for the future upon more strictness in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the Rules of <hi>expedience,</hi> as well as those of <hi>Du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y:</hi> And not to content himself to fly from <hi>vice,</hi> but to get at what distance he can from any thing that looks <hi>like</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) If he be clear of the things imputed to him, He ought then to consider narrowly of what <hi>other sins</hi> he is guilty, that may be the reason of Gods leaving him to the fury of malicious Revilers. <hi>David</hi> did so when <hi>Shimei</hi> curst; He considered the permission of such an abuse as a <hi>judgement</hi> from <hi>Him,</hi> without discharging his rage on his railing ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: And certainly when a man is exposed to <hi>causeless</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy, there is something <hi>more</hi> than malice, and misfortune in the case; God is to be remembred in it, and the provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he hath received from our <hi>unquestionable</hi> sins. <hi>These</hi> he ought to call over in his thoughts, and to humble himself before the Divine Majesty under the sense and apprehension of them. He should consider <hi>these</hi> as the main Adversaries
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65193:7"/>
that have hurt him, and execute his revenge <hi>here,</hi> in destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without mercy, these enemies of his soul, as well as of his credit: He should resolve to be more careful that his <hi>wayes please the Lord,</hi> and <hi>then his enemies will be at peace with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) I would have him tye himself to a greater, and more severe Industry in the Duties of his place: And though he were constant, and laborious in those offices before; yet should he study to <hi>double</hi> his <hi>diligence,</hi> and be more assiduous (if possible) after such usage. He should joyn constant <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techising</hi> to constant <hi>Preaching,</hi> and <hi>frequent Sacraments</hi> to <hi>both;</hi> And study how <hi>otherwise</hi> to promote the spiritual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of his people; and endeavour to do it with all Conscience both towards <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>them.</hi> He should punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally perform <hi>all</hi> that his Rule requires, without <hi>deviations,</hi> or <hi>omissions;</hi> and not content with doing but just what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him, He should imploy himself in all those parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Industries (that the Law allows) that he judgeth tending to the Glory of God, the Honour of Religion, and the Edification of his charge: And take example for his practice from the <hi>strictest</hi> and most <hi>laborious</hi> Divines, yea and strive even to <hi>exceed</hi> them, in all painful and faithful dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) It is further adviseable, in my Opinion, That such an injured Minister, betake himself to great <hi>Privacy</hi> and <hi>Retired<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of living; That he be not frequent in unnecessary vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sits; that he mingle not ordinarily with common, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuous companies; That he be not seen much abroad, but when he is about urgent affairs, and those especially that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to his Office; That he go not without great cause to publick Houses, or places of resort: But that he stick close to his studies, and the preparations that are requisite for the due discharge of his great, and important business.</p>
            <p>However severe these Rules may be thought, I judge they are exceedingly expedient, if not necessary, for a person in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances we suppose. And really there is so much wickedness, folly, and trifling in the ordinary conversations of the world, That methinks no serious, intelligent man should endure to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65193:7"/>
be much in it. And as to the Clergy, There is so much capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and malicious watching upon their words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; so much of what will give them just offence, and which they ought not to hear without reproof; And so much offence ready to be taken at them, and so many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts ready to follow that, if they do reprove; That I see not how they can <hi>honestly</hi> and <hi>safely</hi> converse, except with a few known friends, though the malice of false reports hath not yet touch'd them. And in my judgement 'tis most adviseable for all the Clergy, in this evil Generation, to draw up (as far as is possible) into privacy, and retirement; For the Sea is too rough for them to be abroad upon it: But especially those on whom Envy, and ill-will have fastned any slanderous imputations, are of all Ministers, and all men, the most concern'd to live in as much silence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedness, as their publick Office will permit.</p>
            <p>These things, I know, (and by <hi>some experience)</hi> will contribute very much to the quiet and vindication of such an injured person, and more than all the verbal Apologies in the world: Or if they succeed not to clear his name, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store him to the good opinion of men; There is yet no doubt but they will give him peace and approbation with God, and Conscience, which is infinitely better.</p>
            <p>And if after all this, malice and Infamy should persecute him still; If it should continue upon him the <hi>old</hi> slanders, and out of nothing, and no appearance raise <hi>new</hi> ones to disquiet him, He <hi>need</hi> not, He <hi>ought</hi> not be concern'd, but may despise those impudent falshoods, and scorn to trouble himself to disprove them. He should not yield his enemies the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of having vext, and discomposed him: But rest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self contented with his Innocence, and the Testimony of his Conscience; blessing God that he is not such a person as they would render him to the world, and praying Him to give them a due sense of this their sin, and to pardon them upon their Repentance. In order to which excellent temper, He should frequently consider <hi>Him</hi> who with much long-suffering <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the contradictions</hi> of all sorts of <hi>sinners,</hi> and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd and vilified in his name, as well as injuriously
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65193:8"/>
treated in his person: And since they call'd <hi>Him,</hi> our Lord, <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> and publisht him for a <hi>Wine-Bibber,</hi> a <hi>Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and a <hi>Friend of Publicans and Sinners,</hi> why should we care what they call us; or be at all moved at the <hi>Reproaches,</hi> which we have not deserv'd? <hi>Mens Tongues are their own,</hi> and they <hi>will speak;</hi> and let them say what they will, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hurt us, while we are innocent, if our own <hi>niceness,</hi> and <hi>vitious tenderness</hi> of our names, do not assist their malice. This all good and wise men should endeavour to overcome, and outgrow; But chiefly the Clergy, and those of them especially of whom we are now speaking, ought to be well fortified against this weakness; That they may avoid the temptations to discouragement, impatience, and many other sins, and follies, that an over great concernment for Reputation doth expose men to: That they may go on with courage, and an equal mind, through good Report, and ill Report, in doing of their duty: That they may gain the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble height of wisdom, and Religion to <hi>count</hi> it a small thing to be <hi>approved</hi> and <hi>applauded</hi> by the <hi>judgement,</hi> and voices of <hi>men;</hi> and may attain the generosity of despising popular Fame, otherwise than as it may facilitate their doing good; considering, that <hi>This</hi> is most commonly given to the <hi>foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi> and <hi>worst</hi> of <hi>men,</hi> and <hi>things;</hi> while <hi>infamy</hi> and <hi>reproach</hi> is usually bestowed upon the <hi>worthiest</hi> and the <hi>best.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>such Exercises,</hi> and <hi>such Considerations</hi> as <hi>these;</hi> the scandall'd person shall either wipe off the slanders that are upon him: Or strengthen himself so as not to be hurt by them.</p>
            <p>Thus I have let my pen run on as the humour of writing bad me: If to <hi>no other</hi> purpose; Yet the imployment hath given a little present diversion to my self: And I know you can be content that I should sometimes write for the little end of venting my own thoughts, in declaring my <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> which I have now given you freely, in this matter, and with it the <hi>experience</hi> of</p>
