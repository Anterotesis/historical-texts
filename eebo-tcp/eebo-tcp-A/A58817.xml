            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THESE Words are the Advice of
our Saviour to the impotent man,
whom he miraculously cured af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had long waited to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
at the Pool of <hi>Bethesda:</hi> And seriously
when I consider the miserable state to which
this ancient City was reduced by the late stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious
Fire, and the since glorious recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of it out of its mighty heap of Ruines, it
seems to me an exact emblem of this poor
Patient in my Text. With him, not long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,
it was reduced to a wretched impotent
condition; its goodly Piles lay bed-rid in their
own sad Ruines, almost despairing of Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and the utmost that humane Prudence
could hope, was that the next Age might see
their Resurrection. But by the miraculous
courage and industry with which God inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
their former Inhabitants, behold they are
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101398:3"/>
raised again within a few Years more Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Magnificent than ever; and we that
saw their Desolations, and were almost ready
to give them over for irreparable, have lived
to see them rise again in state and splendour
out of their Ashes. And now that our City is
revived again, and flourishes in perfect health
and vigour, methinks I hear the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
bespeak her, as our Saviour did his reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
Patient in the Text, <hi>Go thy way, and sin
no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.</hi> In
which words you have,</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. A Caution, <hi>Sin no more.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>II. A twofold Reason of it,</item>
               <item>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Behold, thou art made whole.</item>
                     <item>2. Lest a worse thing come unto thee.</item>
                  </list>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>I. I begin with the first of these, <hi>Sin no more.</hi>
Which words plainly imply that he had been
a sinner heretofore; and that because he had
so, therefore he was reduced to that wretched
impotent condition, that his disease was the
punishment of his fault, and the product of
his own wickedness: for otherwise he had no
reason to take warning by it not to sin again;
if his former impotence had not been the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101398:3"/>
of his sin, it could not have been urged
as a proper argument to perswade him to a
future reformation. In this therefore the
strength of our Saviour's Caution lies, The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence
under which thou didst so lately lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish,
and of which I have now recovered
thee, was inflicted on thee by God as a just
retribution for thy wickedness; and therefore,
since thou art thus happily recovered, beware
thou dost not sin again, lest thou provoke him
by it to scourge thee more severely. So that
the main design of this Caution, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
us that those Evils and Calamities under
which we suffer, are some way or other
occasioned by our sin. And indeed if we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially
survey those numerous calamities
which oppress the World, we shall find them
generally reducible to one of these three
Heads. Either (1.) they are the natural Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of sin, Or (2.) the just Retributions of
it, Or (3.) the necessary Antidotes against
it. Of each of these very briefly.</p>
            <p>(1.) In the first place, Many of those evils
and calamities under which we suffer, are the
natural Effects of Sin, and such it's possible was
the disease of which our Saviour cured this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
Patient, even the natural effect either of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101398:4"/>
his Intemperance, Wantonness, or immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Passion, which are the natural causes of
most of those diseases under which we lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish.
For either they are intailed upon us by
our Parents, who beget us usually in their
own likeness; and so having diseased them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by their own Debauches, derive to us
their frail and crazy constitutions, and leave
us Heirs of the woful effects of their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance
and Lasciviousness: for so we
commonly find the Stone and Gout, Consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
and Catarrhs derived through many ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations
from the vices of one wicked Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitor,
who to enjoy the pleasures of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate
Draught, or the embraces of a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Whore, doth many times entail a lingring
torment upon his Children, and his Childrens
Children. Others, again, owe their diseases
to their own personal vices, and by abusing
their Bodies to satisfie their Lusts, convert
them into walking Hospitals; they suck in
Rheums and Defluxions with their intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Draughts, and change the pleasure of a
sober and temperate life, for Fevers and the
uneasiness of Debauches; they swallow their
Surfeits in their gluttonous Meals, and fill their
Veins with flat and sprightless humours, till
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101398:4"/>
by degrees they have turned their sickly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
into mere Statues of Earth and Phlegm.
And in a word, they wast themselves in their
insatiable wantonness, and sacrifice their
strength to a beastly importunity, and many
times contract those noisome Diseases that
make them putrifie alive, and even anticipate
the uncleanness of the Grave. And as our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
Diseases are generally the natural effects
of our Sin, so are most others of those Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
under which we groan. Thus Want
and Poverty are usually the effects either of
our own Sloth or Prodigality, or else of the
Fraud and Oppression of those we deal with:
and Wars and Devastations the natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts
either of the Ambition or Covetousness
of those who are the Aggressors. Thus Sin,
you see, is the <hi>Pandora</hi>'s Box, whence most
of those swarms of Miseries issue that sting
and disturb the World; and indeed, the God
of nature, to deter men from Sin, hath cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
Misery to it so inseparably, that whilst he
continues things in their natural course, we
may as soon be men without being reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
as sinful men without being miserable.
Hence we find, That when he had tryed all
the arts of Discipline on the obstinate Jews,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101398:5"/>
and none were effectual, he at last consigns
them to the dire correction of their own Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
<hi>Ier. 2 19. Thine own wickedness shall correct
thee, and thy backsliding shall reprove thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2.) Again, Secondly, Many of those Evils
and Calamities under which we suffer, are the
just retributions of Sin. For besides those nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
Evils that are naturally appendant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
wicked actions, there are sundry others
under which we suffer, that are the more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
effects of the Divine Displeasure,
and are inflicted on us by God as the condign
Punishments of our Rebellions against him:
and these are such as proceed not from any
necessary causality in the sinful actions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but are wholly owing to the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Heaven, which either inflicts them
immediately upon us, or else disposes second
Causes, contrary to their natural tendency,
to come to the production of them; such
were the Drowning of the World, the Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> the Judgement
of <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> and sundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
such like mentioned in the Scripture. And
though in sundry of those Judgements, which
God inflicts upon sinful men, his hand doth
not so visibly appear as it did in those; yet
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101398:5"/>
sundry of them are impressed with such visible
Characters of the Divine Displeasure, that
we have all the reason in the World to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
them to be the immediate effects of it.
As when we see some great and unexpected
Calamity befal a Sinner in the very commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a wicked Action; or when he is punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in kind, and the Judgement inflicted on
him bears an exact correspondence with his
Sin; or when upon the commission of some
notorious Villany, some strange and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
evil befals him: in these and such like
cases, although it's possible they may be the
effects of some casual concurrence of second
Causes; yet there being such plain indications
of designed Punishment in them, it would be
very unreasonable to attribute them to a mere
blind and undesigning Chance. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
although on the one hand it argues an
uncharitable and superstitious mind to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
every calamity of our Brother to the
Righteous Judgement and Displeasure of
God; yet on the other hand, it's no less an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of a stupid wretchless Soul, to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
those Evils to chance, on which there
are such apparent symptoms of the Divine
Displeasure. And though there is no doubt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101398:6"/>
but many of those evil Events that befal us do
merely result from the established course and
order of necessary Causes; yet there is no
man that owns either a Providence or the
truth of Scripture, but must readily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that in this established course of things,
God very often interposes, and for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding
of good and punishing of bad men,
so varies the courses of these secondary Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
as to produce good and evil by them,
contrary to their natural series and tendencies.
For should he have limited himself to the
Laws of Nature, and resolved to keep things
on for ever in one fatal unvariable course of
motion, he must have tyed up his hands from
rewarding and punishing, which are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
acts of his governing Providence; and
consequently all his promises and threats of
temporal Blessings and Judgments, must have
been perfectly null and insignificant. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must be acknowledged by all that have
any sense of God and Religion, That many of
those Evils under which we suffer, are the just
Judgments of God in retribution for our Folly
and Wickedness. But I see I must hasten.</p>
            <p>(3.) And lastly, many of those Evils and
Calamities we indure, are inflicted as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101398:6"/>
Antidotes against Sin. For certainly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the degenerate state of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the perverseness and disingenuity of the
generality of mankind, Afflictions and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
are as necessary to keep us within the
bounds of Sobriety, as Chains and Whips are
to tame Madmen: And should the great
Governour of the World still indulge to us
our wills, and accommodate all Events to
our desires, we should grow so extravagant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
insolent, that 'twould be impossible to keep
us within any bounds or compass; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
in charity to us, he is many times for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to cross us, and to inflict less Evils on us,
to prevent greater. He sees, that if he should
gratifie our fond Desires, 'twould be a cruel
kindness to us, and hurt us more than ever it
would benefit us; 'twould damp our Piety, or
carnalize our Spirits, swell our Pride, or pamper
our Luxury, give such a loose to our extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
Passions, as would in the end render us
far more miserable than the want of what
we desire can do. And therefore, in mere pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to us, instead of giving us the good we
ask for, he sometimes inflicts the contrary evil:
and as Physicians sometimes prick a Vein in
the Arm to prevent the suffocation of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101398:7"/>
Heart; so God many times afflicts us to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
us, diseases our Bodies to Antidote or
Cure our Souls. So that though those Evils
which God inflicts upon us, are not always
intended for Punishments of our Sin, but
sometimes for Preservatives against it: yet in
this case as well as the other, 'tis Sin that is the
cause of it; 'tis this that makes the evil ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
and obliges God in mercy to inflict
it upon us. He knows the Sin will injure us
much more than the evil he prescribes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it; and therefore being much more sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous
for our safety than our ease, he choos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
rather to make us smart, than to suffer us
to perish. But if it were not for Sin, which
is the worst of Diseases, he would have no
need to Antidote us with Affliction; nor doth
he so much delight to grieve the Children of
Men, as to afflict them for Afflictions sake.
So that were it not for our Sin, either actual
or in prospect, we may be sure, he would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
punish, nor afflict us. Thus Sin, you see,
is the common Cause of Evil, the fruitful
Womb of all kinds of Mischief; for I doubt
not but to one of these three Heads most of
the Miseries of Mankind may be reduced, that
they are either the natural Effects, the just
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101398:7"/>
Punishments, or the necessary Preservatives
of Sin.</p>
            <p>Hence therefore let us learn under all our
Calamities to acknowledge our Sins to be the
cause of them, to trace up our Evils to their
Fountain head, which we shall find is in our
own Bosoms. From hence spring all those
wasting Wars, those sweeping Plagues, those
devouring Fires that make such devastations in
the World; from hence are laid those trains
of Wild Fire that slaughter our Friends, blow
up our Houses, and scatter so many Ruines
round about us. O! would to God we
would once be sensible of it, that we would
every one smite upon his own Thigh, and
cry out, Lord, what have I done? what
sparks have I added to the common flame?
what guilts have I contributed towards the
filling up the measure of <hi>England</hi>'s Iniquities?
But, alas! hitherto we have generally taken
a quite contrary course to this. When God's
Judgements are upon us, we confess that
Sin is the cause of them indeed, but not ours
by any means: 'Tis the Sin of the City, crys
the Country; 'tis the Sin of the Court, crys the
City; 'tis the Sin of this Party, crys one; 'tis
the Sin of t'other Party, crys another. Thus
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101398:8"/>
the Judgements of God are sent from Tithing
to Tithing, and no Body will own them,
though they call us all Fathers. Well, Sirs,
we shall one Day find, God grant it may not
be too late first, that this is not the way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the incursions of the Divine Judgements.
If ever we mean to put a stop to God's Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
against us, we must every one lay our
Hands upon our own Breasts, and lament his
own Sin, and acknowledge his own share in
the general Provocation, and promise and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
our selves, that where-ever we have
done amiss, we will do so no more: Which,
if we wilfully refuse to do, though at present
we are made whole, yet we may certainly
expect that <hi>a worse thing will come upon us.</hi> And
this brings me from the Caution to</p>
            <p>II. The Reasons of it, which, as I told
you, are two:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Thou art made whole.</item>
               <item>2. Lest a worse thing come unto thee.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. I begin with the first, <hi>Behold thou art
made whole,</hi> therefore have a care thou sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
no more: let the mercy I have shown
thee in curing thee of thy Disease, have this
blessed effect upon thee, to reclaim thee from
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101398:8"/>
thy Sins to a life of Vertue and Purity. So
that the sense of this Reason is this, That
God's mercy to us in recovering us from past
Calamities, lays a great Obligation upon us to
reform and amend; but particularly it lays
upon us this threefold Obligation, (1.) The
Obligation of Gratitude, (2.) of Justice,
(3.) and lastly, of Self-interest. Of each of
these briefly.</p>
            <p>(1.) God's mercy in restoring us from any
past Calamity, obliges us in gratitude to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
our lives. 'Tis doubtless one of the most
palpable signs of a base profligate Nature, not
to be obliged by Favours: 'twould be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
to a Brute to call him ingrateful; that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
Epithete no Being can deserve, but one
that is degenerated into a Devil, that has broke
through all that is modest and ingenuous, that
is tender and apprehensive in Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
But to sin on against the mercies of our
Deliverer, to take pleasure in provoking him,
who took pity on us in our low estate, and
snatched us from the brink of ruine, is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
the highest Baseness and Ingratitude: for
whilst we persist in our sinful courses, under the
obligations of his Goodness, we render him the
greatest Evil for the greatest Good, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101398:9"/>
his Favours with the basest Indignities.
Whilst he is shielding us with his careful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
we smite him with the Fist of Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness;
and, like wretched Vipers, sting and
wound him, whilst he is cherishing us in his
Bosome. And is this a suitable answer, do
we think, to the obligations he has laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us? O ungrateful Wretches that we are,
do we thus requite the Lord our God? With
what confidence can we pretend to any thing
that is Modest and Ingenuous, while we thus
persist to return the Favours of our God with
such insufferable Affronts and Indignities?
But then</p>
            <p>(2.) Secondly, God's mercy in restoring
us from any past Calamity, obliges us in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
to amend our lives; for by restoring us,
he acquires a new right to us. As he is the
Author of our Beings, he hath an unalienable
right and property in all the powers and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
of our natures: but every time he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stores
us from an approaching Ruine, he doth,
as it were, create us a new, he gives us our
Lives and Beings afresh, and thereby renews
his Title to us; and so many times as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
us, so many Lives and Beings he giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us: and consequently, so many additional
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101398:9"/>
rights and properties he acquires in us. And
when he hath so many ways entitled himself
to us, by creating, preserving, and restoring us,
what monstrous injustice is it in us still to ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enate
our selves from him, and list those pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and faculties into the service of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
that are his by so many Titles? O un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
that we are, thus to fight against God
with his own Weapons, and affront his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
with the effects of his Bounty! for by
persisting in Sin under his Preservations, we
do not only rob him of our selves, in whom
he hath such an unalienable Propriety, but
also imploy our selves against him. We do
not only purloin his Goods, but convert them
into instruments of Rebellion against him, than
which there is nothing can be more outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
injurious. O wretched man, that very
Tongue with which thou blasphemest him, had
e're this been silent for ever, had not he
stretched out his hand and restored thee.
Those Eyes, through which thou shootest
the noisome Fire-balls of thy Lust, had been
e're this clos'd up in endless darkness, had not
he taken pity on thee, and snatched thee
from the brinks of Ruine. Those Members
of thine, which thou imployest as Instruments
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101398:10"/>
of unrighteousness against him, had now been
rotting in a cold Grave, had not his tender
mercy preserved thee. And canst thou be such
a barbarous Wretch, as not only to deny him
the use of what he gives, but even to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
him with his own Gifts? Consider, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you, how heinously he must needs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
such monstrous injustice and ingratitude.
Hear but how he complains in a parallel case,
<hi>Isa. 1. 2, 3. Hear O heavens, and give ear O earth,
for the Lord hath spoken, I have brought up children,
and they have rebelled against me. The oxe knows
his owner, and the ass his masters crib, but Israel doth
not know, my people doth not consider. Ah sinful na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
a people laden with iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(3.) Thirdly and lastly, God's mercy in
restoring us from past Calamities obliges us in
Self-interest to reform and amend. For if we
do not answer the end of God's deliverances,
they will prove Curses instead of Benefits to
us; and what he intended for a favour, will
convert into an aggravation of our sin and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.
The great end why God deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us, was to win us by his Goodness to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
our sins, and give us space to repent of
them: for so the Apostle tells us, That <hi>the
goodness and long-suffering of God leads us to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:101398:10"/>
in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4. But if it doth not lead us
thither, it will leave us in a far worse conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
than it found us; <hi>i. e.</hi> 'twill leave us load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with much heavier guilt, and bound over to
much sorer punishment. For he that sins on
under his Preservations, is only preserved to
<hi>treasure up wrath against the day of wrath,</hi> and to
prepare more Fuel for his future Flames. So
that, if he still persist in his wickedness, it had
been much better for him that God had let
him alone to perish under his affliction. For
then he had past more innocent into the other
World, and suffered there a much cooler dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:
Whereas now, whenever his wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Ghost departs into Eternity, it will go at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with a louder cry of guilts, with the
cry of so many more wronged mercies and
abused preservations; which will most fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
inhance her Accounts, and inflame the
Reckoning of her torments: so that when
she comes into the other World among those
miserable Spirits, that were snatched away
in the common calamities from whence she
was rescued and preserved, she will find her
self plunged into a condition so much more
intolerable, that she will wish a thousand
times she had been snatched away with them,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101398:11"/>
that so she might never have had the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to contract those guilts that are the woful
causes of it. Wherefore, as we would not
make the mercies of God the causes of our
misery, and turn our Preservations into Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
we are highly obliged upon every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
from past Judgments and Calamities,
to reform and amend our lives.</p>
            <p>And now what remains, but that we seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
consider with our selves how much we
are concerned in this Argument. We of this
Generation are a people whom God hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
with wondrous Judgments and Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances.
We have many of us lived to see
the Bowels of our Native Country ripped up
by an Unnatural War, the righteous Cause of
the Prince and Father of our Country oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by prosperous Villany; his innocent Blood,
our Laws and Liberties and Religion sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to the lust of Rebels and Usurpers. And
when we had long suffered the consequent mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
and confusions, our merciful God took
pity upon us, and after a long Exile, and
without the charge and smart of War and
Bloudshed, restored to us again the lawful Heir
and Successor of our Crown, and, with him,
our Liberties and Religion. This, one would
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101398:11"/>
have thought, was enough to oblige a people
of any ingenuity, and to indear to us for ever
the Author of such a miraculous mercy. But
when instead of being reclaimed by his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
we grew worse and worse, his anger was
kindled again against us, and in his sore dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
he breathed forth a destroying Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
upon us, that in a few Months swept
our Streets, unpeopled our Houses, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
our Towns and Cities into <hi>Golgotha</hi>'s. But
in the midst of so many Deaths we were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
and under the Shield of that Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
were kept in safety, when ten thousand
Arrows flew about our ears. And could we
possibly resist the powerful charms of such an
indearing, such a distinguishing kindness?
Alas! Yes, we could, and did, and were so
far from being conquered by it, that we grew
more obstinate and rebellious. This incensed
him against us anew, and with Fire-brands in
its hands his vengeance came and kindled our
Houses into a devouring flame, that with
wondrous fury did spread and inlarge it self
from House to House, and from Street to
Street, till it had laid this famous Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis
of our Nation in a Heap of Ruines. But
yet in the midst of Judgment, God remembred
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101398:12"/>
Mercy; and when the unruly Element had
baffled all our Arts, and triumphed over all our
resistance, God put a Bridle unto his mouth,
and stopped him in his full cariere: by which
means a great part of us were preserved, and
snatched as Fire-brands out of the Flame.
And though many of us saw our Houses and
Estates buried in the Ruines it made; yet we
have lived to see, and that within a few years,
the consumed <hi>Phoenix</hi> rise out of her Ashes in
greater Glory and Lustre than ever. And
now what have we rendred to the Lord for all
these Mercies and signal Preservations? O un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
that we are! We have turned his
mercies into wantonness, and fought against
him with his own favours: We have spent
those lives which he hath preserved to us, in
grieving, provoking and dishonouring him:
We have turned those Houses he hath restored
to us, into open Stages of pride and luxury:
We have consumed those Estates which he hath
repaired, in supplying our manifold rebellions
against him. Thus with his own mercies we
have waged War with him. What then can
we expect, but that he should disarm us of
those mercies which we have so foully mis-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
and thunder his Judgments upon
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101398:12"/>
us to avenge our abuse of them? For if he
cannot melt our obstinacy with the Fire of
Mercy; 'tis fit he should attempt to break it
with the Hammer of Judgment: and if when
he hath tryed lighter Judgments, they will not
do; 'tis fit he should second them with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and heavier. Which brings me,</p>
            <p>2. To the second Reason of the Caution in
the Text, <hi>Lest a worse thing come upon thee.
i. e.</hi> Beware thou dost not continue stubborn
under thy past Corrections, lest thou thereby
provoke thy angry God to lay his hand yet
heavier upon thee, and to scourge thee with
Scorpions instead of Rods. For it is the usual
method of the Divine Providence, when lesser
Judgments prove ineffectual, to second and
inforce them with greater. Thus he threatens
to deal with <hi>Israel, Levit. 26. 21, 23, 24. And
if ye walk contrary to me, and will not hearken unto
me, I will bring seven times more plagues upon you,
according to your sins. And if yet ye will not be reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by these things, but walk contrary to me, then will
I walk contrary to you, and will punish ye yet seven
times more for your sins.</hi> And just as he threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
so it came to pass: For as they continued
obstinate under God's Judgments; so he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to plague them sorer and sorer, till at
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101398:13"/>
last perceiving their Disease to be incurable,
he cut 'em off, and utterly destroyed them.
And in this method of punishing Sinners gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
with sharper and sharper strokes, when
they continue obstinate under correction,
there is a great deal of Reason and Wisdom.
For (1.) Their obstinacy swells and inhances
their Guilt. (2.) It renders severe Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
necessary. And (3.) Those severer
Punishments render their final Destruction
more inexcusable. Of each of these briefly.</p>
            <p>(1.) God punishes men with heavier, when
they continue obstinate under lighter Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
because their Obstinacy is a greater
aggravation of their Guilt. For though our
Reason indeed tells us, That Sin is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and most dangerous Evil in the World;
yet Reason and Argument hath not compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
that force to perswade men, as their own
Sense and Experience hath: and they will be
much sooner perswaded of the reality of any
evil, by feeling the smart of it, than by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
dry Arguments against it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
though it be a great aggravation of our
guilt, to sin against the clear convictions of our
Reason; yet 'tis a much greater, to sin against
the sharp and dolorous perceptions of our
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101398:13"/>
own Sense and Experience. But now, while
the Judgments of God are upon men, they
feel the dire effects of their Sin; and therefore
if notwithstanding this, they still persist in it,
they sin against their Sense, as well as their
Reason: which is, in effect, a plain defiance
of God, and a daring him to do his worst with
us. For this in effect is the sense and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of our Obstinacy: O God, I know
thou art angry with my Sins, by the dire ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
I now feel and experience; but be it
known to thee, I despise thy Vengeance, and
am resolved to sin on bravely in despight of
all the Judgments thou canst arm against me.
And what greater aggravation of sin can there
be, than to repeat it with such a blasphemous
contempt of the Most High? He is a daring
Thief, we say, that will venture to rob with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
sight of the Gallows; and he is as insolent a
Sinner, that dares sin on in the face of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
It was look'd upon as a monstrous
piece of contumacy in the Jews, that when God
had only forewarned them by the Prophet, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
I frame evil against you, and devise a device
against you; return ye now therefore every one from
his evil way:</hi> they returned this arrogant An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
<hi>There is no hope, but we will walk every one
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101398:14"/>
after his own devices, and we will do every one the
imagination of his evil heart,</hi> Jer. 18. 11, 12.
But how much more arrogant would it have
been, had the Judgment which was only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising
against them been actually executed
upon them! Such an Answer then had been
a plain Declaration, That they were finally
resolved to stand it out against God to the last,
and to take no Quarter at his hands, though
they perished for ever in their Rebellions.
And when mens Guilts are thus inhanced, 'tis
fit their Punishment should be proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
for otherwise they would be lookt upon
as things that happen to men without any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential
Disposal. But now, by regularly
proportioning the Evils of Suffering to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
of Sin, and coupling lesser Evils with les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
Guilts, and greater with greater, and so
equally balancing and adjusting the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Fault; God makes his arm bare
to us, and gives us a plain demonstration,
That the Evils we suffer are the Rods of his
just displeasure.</p>
            <p>(2.) God punishes men with heavier, when
they continue obstinate under lighter Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
because their obstinacy renders heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Judgments necessary. For Punishments
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101398:14"/>
being designed by God for our Cure and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
it's necessary they should be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
to the degree and strength of our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease;
and consequently, when the Disease
of our Sin is grown stronger and more malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
the remedy of our Punishment should
be made sharper and more operative. For
when men are grown inveterately wicked, to
attempt their reformation with smaller Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
is to batter a Wall of Marble with a
Pot-Gun. Such obstinate Rebels must be
stormed with the loudest Artillery of Heaven,
before they will listen to a Surrender. An
Anvil will as soon yield to the Fillip of our
Finger, as a hardened Sinner relent under soft
and gentle Corrections. He must be alarm'd
with some rousing Judgment, and lash'd till
he bleeds again under the Rods of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
or in all probability he will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
for ever. His Disease is inveterate, and
not to be removed but by the strongest Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharticks;
and therefore to prescribe him a
Course of gentle Physick, would be to try
Experiments upon him, and vex and disturb
him to no purpose. God therefore, to cure the
folly and obstinacy of Sinners, is many times
fain to treat them with rigour and severity,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101398:15"/>
when he finds the mild and gentle methods of
his Providence defeated by them. But first
usually he tries the softer and more grateful
Remedies, being unwilling to grieve and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
his Creatures, when there is any other
way to recover them. But when softer
will not do, 'tis Mercy in him to apply seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer;
and his last most commonly are the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
these being the Causticks, as it were,
which he is fain to apply to our Lethargick
Souls, when no other means will awake and
recover us.</p>
            <p>(3.) And lastly, God punishes men with
heavier, when they continue obstinate under
lighter Judgments, to render their final de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
more inexcusable if they won't be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed.
For when God's Threats will not
awake men, he usually sends forth his smaller
Judgments; which, like the Van-Couriers of
an Army, are to begin the Skirmish, before he
falls on with his main Body to ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
them. Which method he observes, out of
great pity to his sinful Creatures, whom he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
threatens before he strikes, and always
strikes before he destroys, that so he may give
them timely and effectual warning to arm
themselves by Repentance, to prevent their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction:
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101398:15"/>
and accordingly the first Judgment
he lets off, he designs for a Warning Piece,
to give notice of a second, and the second of
a third, and all of that ruining and extermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Judgment which brings up the Rear, and
is to conclude the Tragedy. So that his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Judgments do still give notice of the
following, and these of the succeeding, and
all of that final destruction in the War which
closely pursues, and, unless we repent, will at
last overtake us. And when our designed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
approaches us step by step, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
succeeding Judgment brings it nearer and
nearer to us, so that we plainly see it coming
on when 'tis yet at a distance from us, and
yet will not stand out of its way, but despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
meet, dare and defie it; how can we
charge God with being either unjust or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
to us, who hath taken such an effectual
course to warn us of, and retrieve us from it?
When he thus punish'd us more and more, as
our Sin grew greater and greater, this, one
would have thought, might have been suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to terrifie us from our Sins; which, we
plainly saw, were bringing such mischiefs upon
us, and to forewarn us of that gloomy and
fatal issue that attended them. By all which,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101398:16"/>
God doth abundantly manifest how extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unwilling he is to destroy us. But if after
all, we will force him to it, Men and Angels
must confess, That he hath been infinitely
just and good to us, and that the guilt of our
blood lies upon our own heads.</p>
            <p>And now if this be true, That when lesser
Judgments will not reclaim men, God's usual
Method is to second them with greater; how
much reason have we of this Nation to expect
and dread a succession of greater Judgments
than those we have hitherto felt; considering
how much we have degenerated under our
past Corrections, and all along hardened our
selves under the strokes of the Almighty? I
do not love to abode ill things; and did not
our own Sins prognosticate more mischief to
us than any of those suspected Appearances
that fill our heads with so many fears and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies,
I could easily secure my mind of the
continuance of our happiness under far more
threatning apprehensions. But, Alas! when
I consider how obstinately we have persisted
in our sinful ways, in defiance both of the
Mercies and Judgments of Heaven; how,
notwithstanding the advantage we have had
of being better, as having been baptized into
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101398:16"/>
the best Church, and educated in the purest
Religion in the World: a Religion that
advances no Temporal Design, no invention
to enrich or aggrandize its Priests; that hath
no other Aim or Project but only that blessed
one of making men good here, and happy here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after;
that hath no Arts of Compremize be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
mens Lusts and Consciences, no Devices
to supersede the Eternal Obligations of Piety
and Vertue, but binds 'em fast upon our
Consciences by all that we can hope or fear.
When, I say, notwithstanding we have had this
advantage of being good, by being instituted
in such a Religion as this, I consider how we
have grown worse and worse, as if we had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to give the World an Experiment how
bad it's possible for men to be under the most
effectual means of being good; I cannot but
be fearful and jealous, That our multiplying
our Guilts will at length provoke God to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
his Judgments upon us. And O would
to God, that for this reason we would all be
jealous, that we would ground our fears upon
our Sins, and Incorrigibleness under the past
Judgments of God! then they would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
in us far different effects from what they
have hitherto done; then, instead of firing us
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101398:17"/>
with discontent against our Governours, and
exciting us to Faction, Sedition and Clamour,
they would turn all our animosities against our
own wicked Lives; which are the Causes of
all the Evils that we feel or fear: then would
our Fears and Jealousies improve into Piety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, Loyalty towards our Prince,
and Charity and Justice towards one another,
and render us constant to the Profession, and
faithful as to the Practice of our holy Religion.
Which blessed Effects could they once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
then farewel to all Causes of Fears and
Jealousies; then our God would soon disperse
all the Clouds that hang over us, with the light
of his Countenance, and render us a glorious,
a happy and a prosperous people, and crown
us with Everlasting Glory and Happiness
hereafter.</p>
