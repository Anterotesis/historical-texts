            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:63083:3"/>
for the finding whereof ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given no direction in

we have (though ſomewhat
out of place) inſerted it her.</p>
            <p>A fraction whether Vulgar or Decimal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
given to find the logarithme thereof.</p>
            <p>That the way &amp; method here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
may be the better conceived,
the proper charecteriſtique to the logar
of any integer or whole number muſt be
conſidered, and the characteriſtique of
the log arithmes of all numbers, under
10, is 0, of all numbers hetween 10 and
100 is 1, between 100 &amp; 1000 is 2, &amp;
ſo forward, nor will there, as I couceive,
be any inconvenience, if 10 be the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtique
of the logarithme of any
digit, &amp; 11 the characteriſtique of all
numbers between 10 &amp; 100, &amp; 12 the
characteriſtique of all numbers between
100 &amp; 1000, &amp; ſo forward; &amp; yet if
this ſhall be ſuppoſed, the characteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtique
of a number that is but one place
beneath unitie ſhall be 9, if it be two
<pb facs="tcp:63083:4"/>
places beneath unitie it ſhall be, 8 &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus the Log. of 5 will be 10.698970</p>
            <p>The Log. of 5 tenths will be 9.698970</p>
            <p>The Log. of 05 hundreds will be 8.698970</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And upon this ground to find the Log.
of a vulgar fraction,</hi> you muſt ſubtract
the logarithme of the denominator from
the logarithme of the numerator, and
what remaineth ſhall be the logarithme
of the vulgar fraction given.</p>

And as a <hi>point</hi> is the limit or term of a

            <p>11 A Circle is a figure contained
under one round line, which is the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference
thereof: <hi>Thus the round
line</hi> CBDE is called the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of that Circle.</p>
            <p>12 The center of a Circle is the
point which is in the middeſt thereof,
from which point all right lines drawn
to the circumference are equal to one
another: <hi>As in the following figure, the
lines</hi> AB, AC, <hi>and</hi> AD, <hi>are equal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>13 The Diameter of a Circle, is a
right line drawn through the center
thereof, and ending at the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
on the other ſide, dividing the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63083:7"/>
circle into two equal parts.</p>
            <p>As the lines <hi>CAD</hi> and <hi>BAE,</hi> are
either of them the Diameter of the Circle
<hi>CBDE,</hi> becauſe that either of them
doth paſs through the Center A, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videth
the Circle into two equal parts.</p>
            <p>14 The Semidiameter of a circle is
halfe the Diameter, and is contained
between the center, and one ſide of
the Circle. <hi>As the lines AB, AC, AD,

            </p>
            <figure/>
            <p>15 A Semicircle is the one half of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63083:8"/>
a circle drawn upon his Diameter, &amp;

and the Diameter. <hi>As the Semicircle
CBD is half the Circle CBDE and
drawn upon the Diameter CAD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>16 A quadrant is the fourth part
of a Circle, and is contained between
the Semidiameter of the circle, and a
line drawn perpendicular unto the
Diameter of the ſame circle from the
center thereof, dividing the Semicir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
into two equal parts, of the which
parts the one is the quadrant or fourth
part of the circle. <hi>Thus from the center
A the perpendicular AB being raiſed
perpendicularly upon the Diameter
CAD, divideth the Semîcircle CBD
into the two equal parts CFB &amp; FGD
each of which is a Quadrant or fourth
part of the circle CBDE.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>17 A Segment or portion of a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
is a figure contained under a right
line, and a part of the circumference
of a circle, either greater or leſſer then
a Semicircle. <hi>As in the former figure
FBGH is a Segment or part of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63083:8"/>
circle CBDE, contained under the right
line FHG, leſs then the Semicircle
CBD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And by the application of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
lines or terms of a ſuperficies
one to another, are made parallels,
angles, and many ſided figures.</p>
            <p>18 A parallel line, is a line drawn
by the ſide of another line, in ſuch
ſort that they may be equi-diſtant in
all places, and of ſuch there are two
ſorts, the right lined parallel, and the
circular parallel.</p>
            <p>19 Right lined parallels are two
<figure/>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:63083:9"/>
right lines equidiſtant in all places one
from another, which being drawn to
an infinite length would never meet
or concur. <hi>As the right lines FHG &amp;
CAD in the annexed Diagram.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>20 A Circular parallel is a circle
drawn within or without another cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
upon the ſame center, as you may
plainly ſee by the two circles CFGD,
and ABHE which are both drawn
upon the ſame center K, &amp; are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
parallel to one another.</p>
            <p>21 An angle is the meeting of two
lines in any ſort, ſo as they both make
not one line: as the two lines AB
<figure/>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:63083:9"/>
and AC incline the one to the other
and touch one another in the point
A, in which point is made the angle
BAC. <hi>Where note, that an angle is for
the moſt part deſcribed by three letters of
which the ſecond or middle letter repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth
the angular point. Thus in the
angle BAC the letter A repreſenteth
the angular point.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the lines which containeth the
angle be right lines, it is called a right
lined angle: <hi>As the angle BAC.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A crooked line angle, is that which
is contained of crooked lines, <hi>as the
angle DEF.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And a mixt angle, is that which is
contained both of a right and a croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
line, <hi>as the angle GHI.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>22 All angles are either right or
oblique.</p>
            <p>23 <hi>A right angle is an angle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
between two right lines, drawn
perpendicular to one another.</hi> Thus
the angle. ABC is a right angle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the right line AB is perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
to the right line CD and the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:63083:10"/>
24 An oblique angle, is an angle
contained between to right lines not
perpendicular to one another: <hi>as the
angle CBE or EBD, the one whereof</hi>
               <figure/>
[viz.] <hi>EBD is acute or leſs then a right
angle, and the other</hi> [viz.] <hi>CBE is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſe
or more then a right,</hi> &amp; are the
complements of each other to a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micircle.</p>
            <p>25 The meaſure of an angle is the
arch of a circle deſcribed on the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
point, and intercepted between
the two
ſides of the
angle.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>Thus in
the annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram,
the
arch AB is the meaſure of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63083:10"/>

            <p>26 Every circle is ſuppoſed to be
divided into 360 parts or deg. every
degr. into 60 min. or 100 parts, &amp;c.
Therefore a Semicircle as the arch ACD
is 180 deg. a quadrant or fourth
part of a Circle, as the arch ABC is
90 deg.</p>
            <p>27 Complements of arches are
either in reference to a quadrant or a
Semicircle, the complement of an arch
or angle to a quadrant is ſo much as
the arch given wanteth of a quadrant
or 90 deg. <hi>as if the arch AB be 60 deg.
the complement thereof to a quadrant is
the arch BC</hi> 30.</p>
            <p>In like manner, the complement of
an arch or angle to a Semicircle, is ſo
much as the arch or angle given wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
of a Semicircle; as if the arch BED
be 120 degrees, the complement
thereof is the arch AB 60 deg.</p>

            <p>THat the Proportions which the
parts of a Triangle have one to
another may be certain, the
arches of circles (by which the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
of all Triangles, and of Spherical
Triangles the ſides are alſo meaſured)
muſt be firſt reduced into right lines,
by defining the quantity of right lines,
as they are applyed to the arches of a
circle.</p>
            <p>2 Right lines are applyed to the
arches of a circle three wayes, <hi>viz.</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as they are drawn within the
circle, without the circle, or as they
are drawn through it.</p>
            <p>3 Right lines within the circle are
Chords and ſines.</p>
            <p>4 A Chord or ſubtenſe is a right
line inſcribed in a ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cle, dividing the
whole circle into two ſegments: and
in like manner ſubtending both the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63083:22"/>
ſegments: as the right line CK divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the circle GEDK into the
two ſegments CEGK and CDK,
and ſubtendeth both the ſegments,
that is, the right line CK is the chord
of the arch CGK, and alſo the chord
of the arch CDK.</p>
            <p>5 A Sine is a right line in a ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle
falling perpendicular from the
term of an arch.</p>
            <p>6 A Sine is either right or verſed.</p>
            <p>7 A right Sine is a right line in a
Semicircle, which from the term of an
arch is perpendicular to the diameter,
dividing the Semicircle into two ſeg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and in like manner referred to
both: Thus the right line CA is the
ſine of the arch CD leſs then a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant,
and alſo the ſine of the arch
CEG greater then a quadrant, and
hence inſtead of the obtuſe angle
GBC, we take the acute angle CBA
the complement thereof to a Semicir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,

doth never exceed 90 deg.</p>

            <p>9 A Verſed ſine is a right line in a
Semi-circle perpendicular to the right

Sine of the ſame arch; Thus A D is
the verſed ſine of the arch CD and
GBA is the verſed ſine of the arch

GEC the complement of CD.</p>
            <p>10 Right lines without the Circle
whoſe quantity we are to define, are
ſuch as touch the circle, and are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Tangents.</p>
            <p>11 A Tangent is a right line which
touching the circle without, is perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular
from the end of the diameter
to the Radius, continued through the
term of that arch of which it is the
Tangent: Thus the right line FD is
the Tangent of the arch CD.</p>
            <p>12 Right lines drawn through the
circle, whoſe quantity we are to define
are ſuch as cut the circle and are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Secants.</p>
            <p>13 The Secant of an arch, is a right
line drawn through the term of an
arch, to the Tangent line of the ſame
arch: and thus the right line BF is
the Secant of the arch CD: as alſo
of the arch CEG the complement
thereof to a Semicircle.</p>
            <p>14 A Canon of Triangles then is
that which conteineth the Sines, Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents,

            <p>1 A Spherical triangle is that which
is deſcribed on the ſur-face of the
Sphere.</p>
            <p>2 The ſides of a Spherical Triangle

of the Sphere, mutually interſecting

3 The meaſures of Spherical an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
are the arches of great circles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
from the angular point be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the ſides of the angles, thoſe
ſides being continued to quadrants.</p>
            <p>4 Thoſe are ſaid to be great circles

            <p>5 Thoſe circles which cut each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

paſſeth through the poles of the other
and the contrary.</p>
            <p>6 In every Spherical triangle, each
ſide is leſs then a ſemicircle, for if in
the triangle ABC, you produce the
<figure/>
ſides AB, BC, till they meet in the
point D the arches BAD, and BCD
are each of them a ſemicircle becauſe
they interſect each other in the points
B and D, and therefore the arch BA
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:63083:39"/>
or BC is leſs then a ſemicircle. In
like manner if the ſides AB and AC
be produced, the ſide AC may be alſo
proved to be leſs then a Semicircle.</p>
            <p>7 In every Spherical Triang. any two
ſides are together greater then the
third, for otherwiſe they cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
make a triangle.</p>
            <p>8 The ſum of the ſides of a Sphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Triangle are leſs then two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micircles.
For if any two ſides be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
as ſuppoſe AB, BC till they
concur in the point D, the arches
BAD, BCD ſhall be each of them a
ſemicircle, but in the train. ADC, the
ſides AD and CD are together grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then AC by the laſt aforegoing,
therefore the three ſides AB, BC, AC
are together leſs then the two ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circles

            <p>9 If two ſides of a Spherical tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle

            <p>
               <hi>Again.</hi> Let the ſides AB and AC
be leſs then a ſemicircle, ſeeing that
the two angles at C are equal to two

are more then two right.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again.</hi> Let the angle ACD be leſs

the three angles A.B.C. greater then
two right.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly.</hi> Let the angle ACD be
greater then the angle ABC, and
make the angle DCE equal thereto,
and the ſide AB being produced to E
that the arch BE and CE may meet,
and let the arch CA be produced to
F, then ſhall the arches EB and EC
be together equal to a ſemicircle, and
therefore AE and EC are together
leſs then a ſemicircle, and the angle
EAF or BAC is greater then the
angle ACE <hi>by the ninth hereof,</hi> but
the angles ACE, ACB and B are
equal to two right, therefore the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
ACB, ABC &amp; BAC are grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then two right.</p>
            <p>And becauſe every angle of a Sphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Triangle is leſs then two right,
the three angles together muſt needs
be leſs then ſix, as was to be proved.
<hi>Therefore,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>11 Two angles of any Spherical

            <p>12 Any ſide being continued, the
exteriour angle is leſs then the two
interiour oppoſite ones.</p>
            <p>13 In any Spherical Triangle, the
difference of the ſum of two angles,
and a whole circle is greater then the
difference of the third angle, and a
ſemicircle.</p>
            <p>14 In any Spherical Triangle, one
ſide being produced, if the other two
ſides be equal to a ſemicircle, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
angle ſhall be equal to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
oppoſite angle upon the ſide
produced: if they be leſs then a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micircle,
the outward angle ſhall be
greater then the inward oppoſite an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle:
if greater then a ſemicircle, the
outward angle ſhall be leſs then the
inward oppoſite angle.</p>
            <p>In the Spherical Triangle ABC let
the ſide BC be continued to D, and
let the ſides AB and AC be together
equal to a ſemicircle. I ſay then that
the outward angle ACD is equal to

the inward oppoſite angle at B, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

the angle B = D and the angle
ACD = D and therefore angle
ACD = B.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> Let the ſides AB and AC
be leſs then the ſemicircle BAD if the
common arch AB be taken away,
there ſhall remain the arch AC leſs
then the arch AD and therefore the

            <p>

            <p>In the right angled triangle ABC
right angled at A let the ſide AB be

            <p>

at F and A, if it be not leſs, it

neither of the legs are a quadrant.</p>
            <p>

angled at A, the leg AD is leſs then

therefore the Hypotenuſa DH is
alſo greater then a quadrant, for AC
and DC are each of them quadrants

               <p>The Sine of the Middle part and

we convert the angles into ſides: for
the two leſs angles are alwayes equal
unto two ſides of a Triangle compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
by the arches of great circles
drawn from there Poles, and the
complement of the greateſt angle to
a ſemicircle muſt be taken for the third
ſide. If in this triangle therefore thus
connected, you ſhall by the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Problem find an angle, that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
ſo found ſhall be one of the three
ſides inquired.</p>
               <p>As the Triangle ACD the poles of
thoſe arches are H. R and Q, which
connected make the Triangle HRQ,
the ſides of the former Triangle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
equal to the angles of the latter,
taking for one of them, the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the greater angle to a Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle:

as AD is equal to the angle

               <p>DC is equal to the angle at Q, or
the arch MF.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>And AC is equal to the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the angle HRQ, or the
arch GL. Therefore if the angles,
A, D, C, be given, the ſides QR.
QH. RH are likewiſe given.</p>
               <p>If therefore we reſolve the triangle
HRQ by the directions of the laſt
