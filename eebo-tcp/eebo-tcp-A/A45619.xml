            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT is obvious and apparent unto sense, That <hi>Venice, Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Switz,</hi> are not molested with civil War, Strife or
Sedition, like <hi>Germany, France, Spain</hi> and <hi>England;</hi> yet
will men have a Commonwealth to be a confusion. What
confusions we have had in <hi>England,</hi> while the Norman Line
strove for absolute power, while the Barons strove for anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Liberty, while the Houses of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster</hi> strove
for Royal Dignity; and last of all, during these eighteen
years, in the Wars that have been between the King and the
People, in the difference of Judgment both concerning Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and Government, and under the perfidious yoke of
the late Tyranny, is known. At the apparition, or but
name of a Commonwealth, and before any such Orders are
introduced, or perhaps truly understood, all men, or the most
of them, are upon a suddain agreed that there be a good and
perfect Fixation of the Army unto the Old Cause; and that
the remnant of the Long Parliament be assembled: so we
have this for a tast or relish of a Commonwealth, that of the
eighteen, the present year is already the most unanimous.
Nor can this be attributed unsto Chance; seeing the wit of
man, our case considered, could not, I think, have invented
a more natural and necessary way of launching into the
Orders of a Commonwealth, then first by Fixation of the
Army so, as no Council ensuing may have any ambitious
party on which to set up: and then to assemble that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
which hath given testimony of it self, to have been the
most popularly addicted. By these it is no less then demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated,
that the Army is faithful, and the people (for the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52456:3"/>
most active part of them, which in like cases cometh to more
then all the rest) is wise. Be it granted, that the far greater
part of them (<hi>Libertatis dulcedine nondum expecta</hi>) would
force us unto the continuation of Monarchy, if they could,
this is the old temper of a people in like cases: thus the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
upon the death of <hi>Romulus,</hi> forced the Senate, who
would have introduced a Commonwealth, to elect <hi>Numa</hi>
with the succeeding Kings; and could not be brought unto
the abolition of Monarchy, till it was imposed upon them
by <hi>Brutus</hi> to abjure it. Nevertheless, this people having
once tasted of liberty, were of all others the most constant
Assertors of the same. It causeth with the best Politicians
despair, and, as it were, a kinde of tearing themselves, that
the people, even where Monarchy is apparently unpracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable,
and they have no way but a Commonwealth or confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
hold their ancient Laws and Customs unalterable, and
persecute such as advise the necessary change of them, how
plainly soever demonstrated, as Authors of Innovation, with
hatred, if not in tumult and with violence, as when <hi>Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>
in a like assault lost one of his eyes.<note place="margin">See M. B. 1. c. 9.</note> Here is
the discouragement; the Many through diversity
of Opinions, want of reach into the principles
of Government, and unacquaintance with the good that may
by this means be acquired, are never to be agreed in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction
of a new form: but then there is also this conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
that the <hi>many</hi> upon introduction of a new form, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
once to feel the good, and tast the sweet of it, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
agree to abandon it. This is all the comfort that Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians,
in like cases, have been able to give themselves upon
consideration of the nature of the people in general. But if
we consider the nature of the people of <hi>England,</hi> I am much
deceived, or the consolation of knowing men, and good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots,
may yet be far greater. For though the people of
<hi>England</hi> may be twenty to one for Monarchy, they are but
deceived by the name, seeing they having of late years been
more arbitrarily governed then formerly, desire no more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this name, in the truth of their meaning, then not to be
at the will of men, but return unto the Government of Laws;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52456:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for the late Monarchy being rightly considered, was indeed
no more then an unequal Commonwealth; onely here is
the fault of all unequal Commonwealths, they pretend to
be Governments of Laws, and at the same time defer unto
some one, or few men, such power, prerogative and prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence,
as may invade and oppress Laws; which fault was
the cause of perpetual feud, or at least jealousie between our
Kings and our Parliaments. But there is in relation unto the
people of <hi>England,</hi> yet a greater encouragement unto Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths-men:
for though if we look upon the true cause
of popular Government, the balance hath been many years
in turning, yet since it came to be so perceivable as to cause
any mention of a Commonwealth, it is but a short time.
Should we go so far as to compute it from the beginning of
the late VVar, it exceedeth not eighteen years, in which the
eyes and affections of the people are so wonderfully opened
and extended, that I do not think there are fewer then fifty
thousand of the more active and knowing that drive vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
at a Commonwealth; while the rest are not onely calm
and passive, but mature for any good impression without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
or indeed appearance of any VVar or Tumult that can
ensue upon the introduction of a new form: nor is there
the least improbability that an equal Commonwealth may
be received with embraces, seeing a Tyranny came not onely
in, but was supported without blood. But if people for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of their Territory, and for their bulk or number so great
as this of <hi>England,</hi> should fall (to take a larger compass then
I hope we shall need) within the space of thirty years out
of Monarchy, to which they have ever been accustomed, into
a Commonwealth of which they have had no experience nor
knowledge, and that (except in the ruine of Monarchy,
which how infirm soever, useth not to expire otherwise) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
rapine, VVar, or indeed without any great confusion, I
doubt whether the world can afford another example of the
like natural, easie and suddain transition of one Government
into another. Yet ere two parts in three of this time be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired,
men can be despairing. In what (say they) have you
shewn us that we must necessarily be a Commonwealth? Why
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52456:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in this, (say I) that you cannot shew me how we should be
any thing else. In what posture (say they) do we see the
people to give us this hope? VVhy in the very best (say I)
that in this state of Affairs a people (if you consider their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
or nature) could have cast themselves into. This po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
to return is thus, or at least thus I take it to be: The
Armies of this Nation by restitution of their old Officers,
are fixed, resolved upon, and encouraged by the most active
part of the people towards the prosecution of the Old Cause,
or introduction of a popular form: the framing of this form
is modestly and dutifully defer'd by them unto the civil pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in the restitution of the Long Parliament, in that rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of the same which declared for, and obliged themselves
unto this end.</p>
            <p>Now putting this to be the case, I come to the scope of this
Paper, which is to discourse upon this posture; in which to
my understanding, there are but three things that can inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
between us and a Commonwealth, and but two more
that can interpose between us and an equal Commonwealth.
The things that may interpose between us and a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
are such Monarchy, as can no otherwise get up then
by forraign Invasion; or Tyranny, which at the strongest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us was not of any duration, and which changing hands
must still be weaker: of these two, they being onely possible,
and no whit probable, I shall say no more. But the third
thing which can interpose between us and a Commonwealth
is Oligarchy, which in like cases hath been more probable
and incidental, then I conceive it to be at the present: such
a thing if it be introduced among us, is most likely to be of
this form.</p>
            <p>It may consist of a Council not elected by the people, but
obtruded upon us, under the Notion of a Senate or a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance,
or of Religion; and it may be for life, or for some
certain or pretended term, with a Duke or Princely Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
at the head of it, or without one.</p>
            <p>The power at which such a Council doth naturally drive,
is to call Parliaments, and to govern in the intervals: but
the success of such a Council, will be, that if in calling Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52456:4"/>
it do not pack them, it will be forthwith ruined;
and if it do pack them, then the case of such a Councel and
a Parliament will be no otherwise different from the case of
a single person and a Parliament, then that more Masters less
able to support their greatness, &amp; whose greatness we shall be
less able to support, will be a burden by so much more heavy,
then one Master more able to support his greatness, and
whose greatness we were more able to support. But this
will either not be, or be of no continuance.</p>
            <p>The things that can interpose between us and an equal
Commonwealth, are either a Senate for Life, or an Optimacy.</p>
            <p>The seventy elders in Israel, were a Senate for life; this
though constitutively elected by the people, became after
the captivity, or in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Commonwealth (how anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
is uncertain) meer Oligarchy, by the means of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
no man being capable of Magistracy except he were a
Presbyter, no man being made a Presbyter but by laying on
of Hands, and the Prince with the Senate engrossing the
whole power of laying on of Hands.</p>
            <p>Nor were the people thus excluded, and trampled upon
by the Pharisees under other colour then that of Religion,
or tradition derived in their Oral Law or Cabala from <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
in whose Chair they sat, and not only pretended their
Government to be a government of Saints, but in some
things bade fairet for that title then others, who assumed it
afterwards: for that they did miracles, is plain in these
words of our Saviour, unto them: <hi>If I by Beelzebub cast out
Devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they
shall be your judges,</hi> Mat. 12. 27. By which I may believe
that Miracles themselves do not in any wise oblige us to
hope that such a state of Government can be Religious or
honest: much less, where there are no miracles, nor any
such certain distinction to be outwardly made between a
Saint and an Hypocrite, as may secure us that we shall not
have Hypocrites imposed upon us for Saints. The surest
testimony of Saintship in rulers, is, when they are willing to
admit of such orders in Government, as restrain the power
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52456:5"/>
to do wickedly, or of lording it over their brethren.</p>

               </gap>nty for life, is a good guard of the liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
            <p>The next Senate for life, was that of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> consisting of two Kings hereditary, and twenty eight Senators elective.
These notwithstanding they were not eligible but by the
people, and at the sixtieth year of their age, and by the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
or equal Agrarian of their Commonwealth, could not
any one of them excel the meanest Citizen in their lot, or
shares in Land; so vigorously attempted to draw the whole
result of the Commonwealth unto themselves, that if the
people had not <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>riven as vigorously for the preservation of
their right, they had been excluded from making their own
Laws. The expedient found out by the people in this exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
was their election of five annual Magistrates out of
their own number, called the <hi>Ephori,</hi> with power to try,
condemn and execute any of their Kings or Senators which
thenceforth should go about to subvert the fundamental
Laws of their Government, by which it belonged unto the
Senate to debate and propose only, and unto the assembly of
the people to resolve. Without this expedient (which in
another Commonwealth not planted upon a like Agrarian,
would have availed little, as the <hi>Roman</hi> people heard after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
by their Tri<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>unes) had the people af <hi>Lacedemon</hi>
through a Senate for life been deprived of their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealth was also founded upon a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
for life; which though first instituted by election of the
people, came afterwards to be such into which their children
found other admittance, in such manner as from hence grew
a <hi>Pairician</hi> order, ingrossing not only the Senate, and exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the people from bearing Magistracy in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
but oppressing them also by an heavy yoke of Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52456:5"/>
which caused perpetual fewd between this Senate and
the People, and in the end the ruine of the Commonwealth.
Yet entitled this Nobility themselves unto these preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
no otherwise then by such religious rites, as among them
were believed to confer Saintship, and thereby to intitle them
unto Dominion over the people, in which they were also
aided by the Optimacy.</p>
            <p>Now examples of a Senate for Life being of like nature
and necessary consequence, it is my hope and prayer, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any such be introduced in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in case of an Optimacy, a Commonwealth, though not
admitting of a Senate for Life, may yet be unequal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Athens</hi> consisted of a Senate upon annual Rotation; yet
through the Optimacy which was instituted by <hi>Solon,</hi> came
under such a yoke of the Nobility, as upon victory obtained
in the battel of <hi>Plataea,</hi> they took the opportunity to throw
off, and reduce the Commonwealth unto more equality.</p>
            <p>An Optimacy is introduced, where a people is not only
divided by Tribes according to their habitation; but every
Tribe into Classes, according unto their estates or different
measures in riches; as if you should cast all that have above
two thousand pounds a year into one Classis; all that have
above one thousand pounds a year, into another; all that
have above five hundred, into a third; and so forth, for as
many Classes as you like to make.</p>
            <p>Now if in this case the first and second Classes may give
the suffrage of the whole people, as in <hi>Rome;</hi> or that these
only may enjoy the Senate, and all the Magistracies, though
but upon Rotation, as in <hi>Athens;</hi> yet the people, as to these
parts being excluded, the Commonwealth must needs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
unequal: wherefore this also ought to be forewarned,
to the end that it may be prevented.</p>
            <p>To conclude, if we in <hi>England</hi> can have any Monarchy,
we shall have no Commonwealth; but if we can have no
Monarchy, then bar but a Senate for Life, and an Optimacy,
and we must have an equal Commonwealth. Successive Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments,
whether immediately, or with Councels in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52456:6"/>
and like fancies, will be as void of effect, as of example,
or reason.</p>
            <p>But an abundance of things is tedious; we would have
such a Commonwealth as may be dictated in a breath. Thus
then: Let a Senate be constituted of Three hundred, and a
Popular Assembly of One thousand and fifty, each for the
term of three years, and to be annually changed in one third
part. But in case a Commonwealth were thus briefly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctated,
what would this abate of those many things which
must of necessity go unto a like structure, that it may be
equally and methodically brought up from a firm and proper
foundation? there is no way of dictating a Commonwealth
unto facile practice, but by the seeming difficulty of the
whole circumstances requisite, even to a tittle. Nevertheless
to try again: Let the Lands throughout <hi>England</hi> be all cast
into some Parish. Let every Parish elect annually a fifth
Man; let every hundred of these fifth men, with the places of
their habitation, constitute one hundred; then cast twenty
of these hundreds into one Tribe or Shire. Putting the case
the Tribes or Shires thus stated amount unto fifty, let the
fifth men or Deputies in every Tribe or Shire, elect annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
two out of their own number, to be Senators for three
years, and seven to be of the assembly of the people for a like
term, each term obliging unto an equal interval: which
Senate being for the first year constituted of three hundred,
and the Assembly of the people of one thousand and fifty,
gives you those bodies upon a triennial Rotation, and in
them the main orders of an equal Commonwealth. If you
must have a Commonwealth, and you will have an equal
Commonwealth, then (pardon my boldness) after this or
some like manner must you do, because like work never was,
nor can be done any otherwise.</p>
