         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PUBLISHER
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>I Was desirous to make the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
a Present, without being
at the same time oblig'd to
make an Apology. The present
Collection of Poems has afforded
me an occasion to perform it. They
all carry such Credentials, as not
only to justifie the good Taste of
our Age and Nation, in the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb facs="tcp:103161:3"/>
Approbation that has been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of the greater part of them,
but likewise to authorize their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
the Reception of all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity.
It is neither my Province,
nor have I the Presumption to shew,
that the Performances of such Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious
Hands, as this Collection
is made up of, will stand the Test
of the severest Criticisms, and are
work'd according to the Standard
Rules of Poetry: but the best Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
I could advise with, have as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
me they are so; and it is my
Duty as well as Pride, to acquiesce
in their Authority, and Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation.
Nevertheless, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
some small oversights shall have
been committed for want of a due
<pb facs="tcp:103161:3"/>
Review: yet I must beg the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Reader to be pleas'd to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that the Richest Ore will have
some Dross; notwithstanding which
I despair not of so Honourable a
Reception, as shall hereafter give
Encouragement for a Second Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> have lately Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
Five or Six Volumes of their
choicest Poems, by several Hands;
but I must beg, that this Collection
may not be thought to be done in
imitation of them. We are pretty
well recovered from the Servile
way of following their Modes;
and this Publication is an effect
of Emulation, to shew, That as
the <hi>English</hi> Genius and Language
<pb facs="tcp:103161:4"/>
for the <hi>Drama</hi> and for <hi>Epick Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>
has been granted, infinitely
to excel theirs; so we have no less
the Advantage in the less, tho' nice
Productions of the Nature of these
Collections. Their Gallantry and
Courtship is what we justly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
as Foppery; and their Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyricks
are made up of nothing but
Intolerable Dawbing: whereas in
this Collection you will find Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances
of the Sublimest Fancy,
Govern'd by Solidity of Judgment,
and Polish'd by the utmost Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of Art; which sufficiently
demonstrates, that our Great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons,
the <hi>MecoEnases</hi> of Poetry,
can, when they please, be the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gils</hi>
and <hi>Horaces</hi> too.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103161:4"/>
I shall no longer detain the <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Reader,</hi> than to give him my
Assurances that all Care and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
has been used as well by the
Printer as my self, to render this
Impression becoming such finisht
Pieces from so Masterly Hands.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE
TO THE
ART of POETRY.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Have seldom known a Trick succeed, and
will put none upon the Reader; But tell
him plainly that I think it could never be more
seasonable than now to lay down such Rules,
as if they be observ'd, will make Men write
more Correctly, and judge more discreetly;
But <hi>Horace</hi> must be read seriously or not at
all, for else the Reader wo'n't be the better for
him, and I shall have lost my labour. I have
kept as close as I could, both to the Meaning,
and the words of the Author, and done nothing
but what I believe he would forgive if he
were alive; And I have often ask'd my self
that Question. I know this is a Field
<pb facs="tcp:103161:9"/>
Per quem Magnus Equos <hi>Arunci</hi> flexit
Alumnus.</p>
            <p>But with all the respect due to the name of
<hi>Ben. Johnson,</hi> to which no Man pays more
Veneration than I; it cannot be deny'd, that
the constraint of Rhyme, and a literal Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation
(to which <hi>Horace</hi> in this Book de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
himself an Enemy) has made him want
a Comment in many places.</p>
            <p>My chief care has been to Write intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
and where the Latin was obscure, I have
added a Line or two to explain it.</p>
            <p>I am below the Envy of the Criticks, but
if I durst, I would beg them to remember,
that <hi>Horace</hi> ow'd his Favour and his Fortune
to the Character given of him by <hi>Virgil</hi> and
<hi>Varius,</hi> that <hi>Fundanius</hi> and <hi>Pollio</hi> are still
valued by what <hi>Horace</hi> says of them, and
that in their Golden Age, there was a good
Vnderstanding among the Ingenious, and those
who were the most Esteem'd were the best
Natur'd.</p>

               <hi>ROme</hi> was not better by her <hi>Horace</hi> taught,</l>
            <l>Than we are here, to comprehend his
thought:</l>
            <l>The Poet writ to Noble <hi>Piso,</hi> there,</l>
            <l>A Noble <hi>Piso</hi> does instruct us here,</l>
            <l>Gives us a pattern in his flowing Stile,</l>
            <l>And with rich Precepts does oblige our Isle,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:103161:10"/>
               <hi>Britain,</hi> whose Genius is in Verse exprest</l>
            <l>Bold and sublime, but negligently drest.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Horace</hi> will our superfluous Branches prune,</l>
            <l>Give us new rules, and set our Harp in tune,</l>
            <l>Direct us how to back the winged Horse,</l>
            <l>Favour his flight, and moderate his Force;</l>
            <l>Though Poets may of Inspiration boast,</l>
            <l>Their Rage ill govern'd, in the Clouds is lost;</l>
            <l>He that proportion'd wonders can disclose,</l>
            <l>At once his Fancy and his Judgment shows.</l>
            <l>Chast moral Writing we may learn from hence</l>
            <l>Neglect of which no wit can recompence;</l>
            <l>The Fountain which from <hi>Helicon</hi> proceeds,</l>
            <l>That sacred Stream should never water weeds,</l>
            <l>Nor make the Crop of Thorns and Thistles grow</l>
            <l>Which Envy or perverted Nature sow.</l>
            <l>Well-sounding Verses are the Charm we use,</l>
            <l>Heroick thoughts, and vertue to infuse;</l>
            <l>Things of deep sense we may in Prose unfold,</l>
            <l>But they move more, in lofty numbers told;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:103161:10"/>
By the loud Trumpet, which our Courage aids,</l>
            <l>We learn that sound, as well as sense perswades.</l>
            <l>The Muse's Friend, unto himself severe,</l>
            <l>With silent pity looks on all that Err;</l>
            <l>But where a brave, a publick Action shines,</l>
            <l>That he rewards with his Immortal Lines;</l>
            <l>Whether it be in Counsel or in Fight,</l>
            <l>His Countrey's Honour is his chief delight;</l>
            <l>Praise of great Acts, he scatters as a seed,</l>
            <l>Which may the like, in coming Ages breed:</l>
            <l>Here taught the fate of Verses, always priz'd</l>
            <l>With admiration, or as much despis'd,</l>
            <l>Men will be less indulgent to their faults,</l>
            <l>And patience have to cultivate their thoughts,</l>
            <l>Poets lose half the praise they should have got,</l>
            <l>Could it be known, what they discreetly blot,</l>
            <l>Finding new words, that to the ravish't Ear,</l>
            <l>May like the Language of the Gods appear,</l>
            <l>Such as of old, wise Bards employ'd to make</l>
            <l>Unpolish't men their wild retreats forsake,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:103161:11"/>
Law-giving-Heroes, fam'd for taming Brutes,</l>
            <l>And raising Cities with their Charming Lutes,</l>
            <l>For rudest minds, with Harmony were caught:</l>
            <l>And civil Life was by the Muses taught.</l>
            <l>So wandring Bees would perish in the Air,</l>
            <l>Did not a sound, proportion'd to their Ear,</l>
            <l>Appease their rage, invite them to the Hive,</l>
            <l>Unite their force, and teach them how to thrive,</l>
            <l>To rob the Flowers, and to forbear the spoil,</l>
            <l>Preserv'd in Winter by their Summers toyl,</l>
            <l>They give us food, which may with Nectar Vie,</l>
            <l>And Wax that does, the absent Sun supply.</l>

OF THE

            <lg>
               <l>IF in a Picture (<hi>Piso</hi>) you should see</l>
               <l>A handsome Woman with a Fishes Tail,</l>
               <l>Or a Man's Head upon a Horse's Neck,</l>
               <l>Or Limbs of Beasts of the most different kinds,</l>
               <l>Cover'd with Feathers of all sorts of Birds,</l>
               <l>Wou'd you not laugh, and think the Painter mad?</l>
               <l>Trust me that Book is as ridiculous,</l>
               <l>Whose incoherent Stile (like sick Mens Dreams)</l>
               <l>Varies all Shapes, and mixes all Extreams.</l>
               <l>Painters and Poets have been still allow'd,</l>
               <l>Their Pencils, and their Fancies unconfin'd,</l>
               <l>This priviledge we freely give and take;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:103161:12"/>
But Nature, and the Common Laws of Sense,</l>
               <l>Forbid to reconcile <hi>Antipathies,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Or make a Snake engender with a Dove,</l>
               <l>And hungry Tygers court the tender Lambs;</l>
               <l>Some that at first have promis'd mighty things,</l>
               <l>Applaud themselves, when a few slorid Lines</l>
               <l>Shine through th' insipid dulness of the rest;</l>
               <l>Here they describe a Temple, or a Wood,</l>
               <l>Or Streams that through delightful Medows run,</l>
               <l>And there the Rainbow, or the rapid <hi>Rhine,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But they misplace them all, and croud them in,</l>
               <l>And are as much to seek in other things,</l>
               <l>As he that only can design a Tree,</l>
               <l>Would be to draw a Shipwreck or a Storm.</l>
               <l>When you begin with so much Pomp and Show,</l>
               <l>Why is the end so little and so low?</l>
               <l>Be what you will, so you be still the same.</l>
               <l>Most Poets fall into the grossest faults,</l>
               <l>Deluded by a seeming Excellence:</l>
               <l>By striving to be short, they grow Obscure,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:103161:12"/>
And when they would write smoothly they want
strength,</l>
               <l>Their Spirits sink; while others that affect</l>
               <l>A lofty Stile, swell to a Tympany;</l>
               <l>Some timerous wretches start at every blast,</l>
               <l>And fearing Tempests, dare not leave the Shore;</l>
               <l>Others in love with wild variety,</l>
               <l>Draw Boars in Waves, and Dolphins in a Wood;</l>
               <l>Thus fear of Erring, joyn'd with want of Skill,</l>
               <l>Is a most certain way of Erring still.</l>
               <l>The meanest Workman in the Aemilian Square,</l>
               <l>May grave the Nails, or imitate the Hair,</l>
               <l>But cannot finish what he hath begun;</l>
               <l>What is there more ridiculous than he?</l>
               <l>For one or two good features in a Face</l>
               <l>Where all the rest are scandalously ill,</l>
               <l>Make it but more remarkably deform'd.</l>
               <l>Let Poets match their Subject to their strength,</l>
               <l>And often try what weight they can support,</l>
               <l>And what their Shoulders are too weak to bear,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:103161:13"/>
After a serious and judicious choice,</l>
               <l>Method and Eloquence will never fail;</l>
               <l>As well the Force as Ornament of Verse,</l>
               <l>Consist in choosing a fit time for things,</l>
               <l>And knowing when a Muse should be indulg'd</l>
               <l>In her full flight, and when she should be curb'd.</l>
               <l>Words must be chosen, and be plac'd with skill,</l>
               <l>You gain your point, if your industrious Art</l>
               <l>Can make unusual words easie and plain,</l>
               <l>But (if you write of things Abstruse or New)</l>
               <l>Some of your own inventing may be us'd,</l>
               <l>(So it be seldom and discreetly done)</l>
               <l>But he that hopes to have new Words allow'd,</l>
               <l>Must so derive them from the Graecian Spring,</l>
               <l>As they may seem to flow without constraint;</l>
               <l>Can an Impartial Reader discommend</l>
               <l>In <hi>Varus,</hi> or in <hi>Virgil</hi> what he likes?</l>
               <l>In <hi>Plautus</hi> or <hi>Caecilius?</hi> Why should I</l>
               <l>Be envy'd for the little I invent,</l>
               <l>When <hi>Ennius</hi> and <hi>Cato</hi>'s copious Style</l>
               <l>

               <l>Men ever had, and ever will have leave,</l>
               <l>To coin new words well suited to the age:</l>
               <l>Words are like Leaves, some wither every year,</l>
               <l>And every year a younger Race succeeds;</l>
               <l>Death is a Tribute all things owe to Fate;</l>

               <l>We Plow and Reap where former Ages row'd.</l>

               <l>Confin'd by our great Emperor's Command;</l>
               <l>Yet this and they, and all will be forgot;</l>
               <l>Why then should Words challenge Eternity,</l>
               <l>When greatest Men, and greatest Actions dye?</l>
               <l>Use may revive the obsoletest Words,</l>

               <l>Of all the Passions which Mankind destroy,</l>
               <l>I only felt excess of Love and Joy:</l>
               <l>Numberless Pleasures charm'd my Sense, and they</l>

               <l>From Heav'n her Beauty like fierce Light'ning

               <l>Ah! Dear <hi>Orontes,</hi> my hard Fate denys</l>
               <l>That hope is the last thing which in us dies:</l>
               <l>From my griev'd Breast all those soft Thoughts
are fled,</l>
               <l>And Love survives, although my Hope is dead;</l>
               <l>I yield my Life, but keep my Passion yet,</l>
               <l>And can all thoughts but of <hi>Orontes</hi> quit;</l>
               <l>My flame increases as my strength decays,</l>
               <l>Death, which puts out the light, the heat does raise;</l>
               <l>That still remains, though I from hence remove,</l>
               <l>I lose my Lover, but I keep my Love.</l>

                  <hi>The Sigh,</hi> which sent forth that last tender word,</l>
               <l>Up towards the Heav'ns like a bright <hi>Meteor</hi>
soar'd,</l>
               <l>And the Kind Nymph bereft of all her Charms,</l>

               <l>Here let me end the Story of my Cares,</l>
               <l>My Dismal Grief enough the rest declares.</l>
               <l>Judge thou by all this Misery display'd,</l>

               <l>Thou visitest, Men tremble at thy Face,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:103161:33"/>
And fear thy Name; once let thy fatal hand</l>
               <l>Fall on a Swain, that does the blow demand.</l>
               <l>Vouchsafe thy Dart: I need not one of those,</l>
               <l>With which thou dost unwilling Kings depose;</l>
               <l>Thy weakest, my desir'd release can bring,</l>
               <l>And free my Soul already on her wing.</l>
               <l>But since all Prayers and Tears are vain, I'll try,</l>

            <l>YOU tell me, <hi>Celia,</hi> you approve,</l>
            <l>Yet never must return my love;</l>
            <l>An answer that my hope destroys,</l>
            <l>And in the Cradle wounds our joys.</l>
            <l>To kill at once what needs must die,</l>
            <l>None would to Birds and Beasts deny.</l>
            <l>How can you then so cruel prove,</l>
            <l>As to preserve and torture Love?</l>
            <l>That Beauty Nature kindly meant</l>

            <l>

Why shou'd the Tyrant Honour make</l>
            <l>Our greatest torment? Let us break</l>
            <l>His Yoke, and that base power disdain,</l>
            <l>Which only keeps the good in pain.</l>
            <l>In Love and War th' Impostor do's</l>
            <l>The best to greatest harms expose.</l>
            <l>Come then, my <hi>Celia,</hi> let's no more</l>
            <l>This Devil, for a God adore.</l>
            <l>Like foolish <hi>Indians</hi> we have been,</l>
            <l>Whose whole Religion is a sin.</l>
            <l>If we the Laws of Love had kept,</l>
            <l>And not in Dreams of Honour slept,</l>
            <l>He wou'd have surely, long ere this,</l>
            <l>Have Crown'd us with the highest Bliss;</l>
            <l>Our Joy had then been as compleat,</l>

            <l>To Honour there were nothing due:</l>
            <l>Then would I pay my Debt of Love</l>

            <l>Which now you must in Friendship take,</l>
            <l>'Tis all the Payment I can make;</l>
            <l>Friendship so high, that I must say,</l>
            <l>'Tis rather Love with some allay.</l>
            <l>And rest contented, since that I</l>
            <l>As well my self as you deny.</l>
            <l>Learn then of me bravely to bear</l>
            <l>The want of what you hold most dear;</l>
            <l>And that which Honour does in me,</l>

               </l>
               <l>But before that day comes (Heavens) may I have</l>
               <l>The mournful Privilege of an early Grave!</l>
               <l>For I, of your dear Company bereft,</l>
               <l>Have no <hi>Reserve,</hi> no second Comfort left.</l>
               <l>My Father, who did in <hi>Cilicia Reign,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>By fierce <hi>Achilles</hi> was in Battel Slain:</l>
               <l>His Arms that Savage Conquerour durst not spoil,</l>
               <l>But paid just Honours to his Funeral Pile:</l>
               <l>Wood-Nymphs about his Grave have planted since</l>
               <l>A rural Monument to a mighty Prince:</l>
               <l>Seven Brothers, who seven Legions did Command,</l>
               <l>Had the same Fate, from the same murdering hand.</l>
               <l>My Mother too, who <hi>their</hi> sad Heir did reign,</l>
               <l>With a vast Treasure was Redeem'd in vain;</l>
               <l>For she soon clos'd her Empire, and her Breath,</l>
               <l>By Wretches last good fortune—Sudden Death.</l>

Thus Father, Mother, Brethern, all is gone,</l>
               <l>But they seem all alive in <hi>you</hi> alone.</l>
               <l>To gain you, those <hi>Endearments</hi> I have sold,</l>

               <l>Have pity then, here in this Tower abide,</l>

               <l>I have revolv'd in serious Thoughts before.</l>

               <l>Perhaps some haughty Dame your hands shall doom,</l>

            <head>ON A
POET
Who Writ in the Praise of
SATYR.</head>
            <byline>By the Earl of Rochester.</byline>
            <l>TO vex and torture thy unmeaning Brain</l>
            <l>In Satyr's praise, to a low untun'd strain,</l>
            <l>In thee, was most impertinent and vain.</l>
            <l>When in thy Person we more plainly see</l>
            <l>That Satyr's of Divine Authority;</l>
            <l>For God made one on Man, when he made thee:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:103161:63"/>
In whom are all those Contradictions joyn'd,</l>
            <l>That make a Fop prodigious, and refin'd;</l>
            <l>A Lump deform'd and shapeless, wert thou born,</l>
            <l>Begot in Love's despight, and Nature's scorn,</l>
            <l>And art grown up the most ungainly Wight,</l>
            <l>Harsh to the Ear, and hideous to the Sight:</l>
            <l>Yet Love's thy Business, Beauty thy Delight.</l>
            <l>Curse on that silly hour that first inspir'd</l>
            <l>Thy Longing to Admire, and be Admir'd,</l>
            <l>To paint thy Grizly Face, to Dance, to Dress,</l>
            <l>And all those awkard Motions that express</l>
            <l>Thy Loathsome Love, and Filthy Daintiness.</l>
            <l>Who needs will be an Ugly <hi>Beau, Garsoon,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Spit at, and scorn'd by every Girl in Town;</l>
            <l>Where dreadfully Love's Scare-crow thou art
plac'd</l>
            <l>To fright the tender Flock, who long to taste.</l>
            <l>For none so Lewd and Silly yet have prov'd,</l>

            <head>EPILOGUE
TO
Every Man in his Humor.</head>
            <byline>By the same Author.
*</byline>
            <l>INtreaty shall not serve, nor Violence,</l>
            <l>To make me speak in such a Play's defence:</l>
            <l>A Play, where Wit and Humour do agree</l>
            <l>To break all practis'd Laws of <hi>Comedy:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>The Scene (what more absurd) in <hi>England</hi> lies,</l>
            <l>No Gods descend, nor dancing Devils rise;</l>
            <l>No Captive Prince, from nameless Countrey</l>
            <l>brought,</l>
            <l>No Battel, nay, there's not a Duel fought.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:103161:66"/>
And something yet more sharply might be said.</l>
            <l>But I consider the poor Author's Dead:</l>
            <l>Let that be his Excuse—Now for our own,</l>
            <l>Why—Faith, in my Opinion, we need none.</l>
            <l>The parts were fitted well; but some will say,</l>
            <l>Pox on 'em Rogues, What made'em chuse this Play?</l>
            <l>I do not doubt but you will credit me,</l>
            <l>It was not Choice, but meer Necessity.</l>
            <l>To all our writing Friends, in Town, we sent,</l>
            <l>But not a Wit durst venture out in <hi>Lent.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Have patience but till <hi>Easter</hi>-Term, and then</l>
            <l>You shall have Jigg and Hobby-horse again.</l>
            <l>Here's Mr. <hi>Matthew,</hi> or Domestick Wit,</l>
            <l>Does promise one of the ten Plays h'as writ:</l>
            <l>But since great Bribes weigh nothing with the
Just,</l>
            <l>Know, we have Merits, and in them we trust;</l>

We ride not forth, although the Day be fair,</l>
            <l>On Ambling Tit, to take the Suburb-air:</l>
            <l>But with our Authors meet, and spend that time</l>
            <l>To make up Quarrels between Sense and Rhyme.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Wednesdays</hi> and <hi>Fridays,</hi> constantly we sate,</l>

            <l>For divers weighty Reasons, 'twas thought fit,</l>
            <l>Unruly Sense shou'd still to Rhyme submit.</l>
            <l>This the most wholesome Law we ever made,</l>
            <l>So strictly in this <hi>Epilogue</hi> obey'd:</l>
            <l>Sure, no Man here will ever dare to break.</l>

            <l>And add new faults still to the great Offence</l>
            <l>Your Ancestors so rashly did commit</l>
            <l>Against the mighty Powers of Art and Wit?</l>
            <l>When they condemn'd those noble works of mine</l>

Repent, or on your guilty Heads shall fall</l>
            <l>The Curse of many a Rhyming Pastoral:</l>
            <l>The three bold <hi>Beauchamps</hi> shall revive again,</l>
            <l>And with the <hi>London</hi> Prentice conquer <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>All the dull Follies of the former Age</l>

            <l>But if you pay the great Arrears of Praise,</l>
            <l>So long since due to my much injur'd Plays:</l>
            <l>From all past Crimes I first will set you free,</l>
            <l>And then inspire some one to write like me.</l>

            <l>WHile others toil, our Country to supply</l>
            <l>With what we need only for Luxury,</l>
            <l>Spices, and Silk, in the rich East provide,</l>
            <l>To glut our Avarice, and feed our Pride.</l>
            <l>You Foreign Learning prosperously transmit,</l>
            <l>To raise our Virtue, and provoke our Wit.</l>
            <l>Such brave Designs your Gen'rous Soul inflame</l>
            <l>To be a bold Adventurer for Fame;</l>
            <l>How much oblig'd are <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>France,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>While with your Voice their Musick you advance?</l>

In these Attempts, so few have had success,</l>

            <l>As if you meant these Injuries to atone,</l>

their own.</l>
            <l>Not like the dull laborious Flatterer,</l>
            <l>With secret Art those Graces you confer.</l>
            <l>The skilful Painters, with slight stroaks impart,</l>
            <l>That subtil <hi>Beauty</hi> which affects the Heart.</l>
            <l>There are, who publickly profess they hate</l>
            <l>Translations, and yet all they Write, Translate:</l>
            <l>So proud, they scorn to drive a Lawful Trade,</l>
            <l>Yet by their Wants, are shameless Pirates made:</l>
            <l>These you incense, while you their Thefts reveal,</l>
            <l>Or else prevent in what they meant to steal</l>
            <l>From all besides; you are secure of praise,</l>

               <l>HOpeless I languish out my Days,</l>

            <l>AS in those Nations where they yet adore</l>
            <l>Marble and Cedar, and their aid implore,</l>
            <l>'Tis not the Workman, nor the precious Wood,</l>
            <l>But 'tis the Worshipper that makes the <hi>God:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>So, cruel Fair, tho Heaven has giv'n thee all</l>
            <l>We Mortals (Virtue, or can <hi>Beauty</hi>) call,</l>
            <l>'Tis we that give the Thunder to your Frowns,</l>
            <l>Darts to your Eyes, and to our selves the Wounds.</l>
            <l>Without our Love, which proudly you deride,</l>
            <l>Vain were your <hi>Beauty,</hi> and more vain your Pride,</l>
            <l>All envy'd Beings that the World can shew,</l>
            <l>Still to some meaner thing their greatness owe.</l>

Subjects make Kings, and we (the numerous
Train</l>
            <l>Of Humble Lovers) Constitute thy Reign.</l>
            <l>This difference only Beauties Realm may boast,</l>
            <l>Where most it favours, it enslaves the most.</l>
            <l>And they to whom it is indulgent found,</l>
            <l>Are ever in the rudest Fetters bound.</l>
            <l>What Tyrant yet, but thee, was ever known</l>
            <l>Cruel to those that serv'd to make him one?</l>
            <l>Valour's a Vice, if not with Honour joyn'd,</l>
            <l>And Beauty a Disease, when 'tis not kind.</l>

            <l>AH! Pardon, <hi>Madam,</hi> if I ever thought</l>
            <l>Your smallest Favours could too dear be
bought;</l>
            <l>And the just greatness of your Servant's Flame,</l>
            <l>I did the poorness of their Spirits Name;</l>
            <l>Calling their due attendance, Slavery,</l>
            <l>Your power of Life and Death, flat Tyranny;</l>
            <l>Since now I yield, and do confess, there is</l>
            <l>No way too hard that leads to such a bliss.</l>
            <l>So when <hi>Hippomanes</hi> beheld the Race,</l>
            <l>Where Loss was Death, and Conquest but a
Face,</l>
            <l>

He stood amazed at the fatal strife,</l>
            <l>Wondring that Love shou'd dearer be than Life,</l>
            <l>But when he saw the Prize, no longer staid,</l>
            <l>But through those very dangers sought the Maid,</l>
            <l>And won her too: O may his Conquest prove</l>
            <l>A happy Omen to my purer Love;</l>
            <l>Which, if the honour of all Victory</l>
            <l>In the resistance of the Vanquisht lie,</l>
            <l>Though, it may be, the least regarded Prize,</l>
            <l>Is not the smallest Trophy of your Eyes.</l>

            <l>FEar not, <hi>My Dear,</hi> a Flame can never die,</l>
            <l>That is once kindled by so bright an Eye:</l>
            <l>Look on thy self, and measure thence my Love,</l>
            <l>Think what a Passion such a Form must move;</l>
            <l>For though thy Beauty first allur'd my Sight,</l>

            <l>That knot (be confident) will ever last,</l>

            <l>So fast, that time (although it may disarm</l>

And Age, deluded when it comes, will find</l>

            <l>The Passion I have now, shall ne'er grow less:</l>
            <l>No, though thy own Fair Self should it oppress.</l>
            <l>I could e'en hazard my Eternity,</l>
            <l>Love but again, and 'twill a Heaven be.</l>

Imperfect Enjoyment.</head>
            <byline>By Sir George Etherege.</byline>
            <l>AFter a Pretty, Amorous Discourse,</l>
            <l>She does resist my Love with a pleasing
force;</l>
            <l>Mov'd not with Anger, but with Modesty,</l>
            <l>Against her will she is my Enemy.</l>
            <l>Her Eyes the rudeness of her Arms excuse,</l>
            <l>Whilst those accept what these seem to refuse;</l>
            <l>To ease my Passion, and to make me blest,</l>
            <l>Th' obliging Smock falls from her whiter Breast;</l>
            <l>Then with her lovely Hands she does conceal</l>
            <l>Those Wonders Chance so kindly did reveal;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:103161:97"/>
In vain, alas, her nimble Fingers strove</l>
            <l>To shield her <hi>Beauties</hi> from my greedy Love;</l>
            <l>Guarding her Breasts, her Lips she did expose,</l>
            <l>To save a Lilly she must lose a Rose;</l>
            <l>So many Charms she has in ev'ry place,</l>
            <l>A hundred Hands cannot defend each Grace.</l>
            <l>Sighing, at length her force she does recal,</l>
            <l>For since I must have Part, she'll give me All.</l>
            <l>Her Arms the joyful Conqueror embrace,</l>
            <l>And seem to guide me to the sought-for place.</l>
            <l>Her Love is in her sparkling Eyes exprest,</l>
            <l>She falls o'th' Bed for Pleasure, more than rest.</l>
            <l>But Oh, strange Passion! Oh, Abortive Joy!</l>
            <l>My Zeal does my Devotion quite destroy,</l>
            <l>Come to the Temple, where I shou'd Adore</l>
            <l>My Saint, I Worship at the sacred Door;</l>
            <l>Oh, cruel Chance! The Town which did op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</l>
            <l>My Strength so long, now yields to my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spose;</l>

When, overjoy'd with Victory, I fall</l>
            <l>Dead at the foot of the surrender'd Wall,</l>
            <l>Without the usual Ceremony, we</l>
            <l>Have both fulfill'd the Am'rous Mystery,</l>
            <l>The Action which we shou'd have joyntly
done,</l>
            <l>Each has unluckily perform'd alone;</l>
            <l>The Union which our Bodies shou'd enjoy,</l>
            <l>The Union of our eager Souls destroy.</l>
            <l>Our Flames are punish'd by their own excess,</l>
            <l>W'd had more Pleasure had our Loves been less;</l>
            <l>She Blush'd and Frown'd, perceiving we had
done</l>
            <l>The Sport, she thought, we scarce had yet
begun.</l>
            <l>Alas, said I, Condemn your Self, not Me;</l>
            <l>This is th' effect of too much Modesty.</l>
            <l>Hence with that peevish Virtue, the Delight</l>
            <l>Of both our Victories was lost i'th' Fight;</l>

Yet from my Shame, your Glory does arise,</l>
            <l>My Weakness proves the Vigour of your Eyes:</l>
            <l>They did consume the Victim, e're it came</l>

               <hi>Phillis,</hi> let then this Comfort ease your Care,</l>

            <head>ON THE
STORM
BETWEEN
Gravesend and Diepe;
Made at that Time.</head>
            <byline>By the same Author.</byline>
            <l>WHen the Tempestuous Sea did foam
and roar,</l>
            <l>Tossing the Bark from the long-wish'd for Shore;</l>
            <l>With false affected fondness it betray'd,</l>
            <l>Striving to keep what Perish'd, if it stay'd.</l>
            <l>Such is the Love of Impious Men, where e're</l>

               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:103161:127"/>
I, toss'd in tedious Storms of troubled Thought,</l>
            <l>Was careless of the Waves the Ocean brought.</l>
            <l>My Anchor <hi>Hope</hi> was lost, and too too near</l>
            <l>On either hand were Rocks of sad Despair.</l>
            <l>Mistaken Seamen prais'd my fearless Mind,</l>
            <l>Which, sunk in Seas of Grief, could dare the
Wind.</l>
            <l>In Life, tempestuous Life is dread and harm,</l>
            <l>Approaching Death had no unpleasing Form;</l>
            <l>Approaching Death appeases ev'ry Storm.</l>

            <l>And now your Tears afresh his Laurel crown.</l>
            <l>It is this Flight of yours excites my Art,</l>

COMPLAINT.</head>
            <byline>By the same Author.</byline>
            <l>IN soft Complaints no longer ease I find,</l>
            <l>That latest refuge of a Tortur'd Mind;</l>
            <l>Romantick Heros may their Fancy please</l>
            <l>In telling of their Griefs to senceless Trees.</l>
            <l>'Tis now to me no pleasure to rehearse</l>
            <l>A doleful Tale in Melancholy Verse!</l>
            <l>Men are more Deaf than Trees, more Wild than
Seas:</l>
            <l>Complaints and Tears will sooner Storms appease,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:103161:130"/>
Than draw soft pity from an Humane Breast.</l>
            <l>All Sooth the Happy, and Despise the Opprest.</l>
            <l>Each Man who lives, of sorrow hath his share,</l>
            <l>Or else of Pride, and cannot pity spare,</l>
            <l>For those whose weight is more than one can
bear.</l>
            <l>All who are happy, do their Merit boast,</l>
            <l>Think Heaven ows 'em more, and Heav'n is Just.</l>
            <l>Still they observe the Opprest with Partial Eyes,</l>
            <l>And think their Crimes draw Vengeance from
the Skies.</l>
            <l>But were they gentle, pitiful, and mild,</l>
            <l>Not (as they are) rough, unconcern'd and wild.</l>
            <l>What Joy can pity bring on other's Grief?</l>
            <l>For what I feel, affords me no relief;</l>
            <l>To see another's Eyes with pity melt,</l>
            <l>For wretched me, would add to what I felt.</l>
            <l>Since in Complaints there can no ease be found,</l>
            <l>For such an Heart as mine in sorrow drown'd.</l>

Sleep, sleep, <hi>Melpomene,</hi> thou, mournful Muse:</l>
            <l>For of my Torments, I will thee accuse.</l>
            <l>I'll say thou keep'st 'em waking with thy Charms,</l>
            <l>And drives soft slumbers from my Longing Arms.</l>
            <l>Sleep, sleep, my Muse, and let my Cares alone;</l>
            <l>But if thou wilt not, since thy Harp is strung,</l>
            <l>Attend a while, and, like a dying Swan,</l>
            <l>My latest Accents shall be sweetly sung.</l>

            <head>WIT's ABUSE.</head>
            <byline>By the same Author.</byline>
            <l>I Ask not why <hi>Astraea</hi> fled away,</l>
            <l>But wonder more, why any Vertues stay;</l>
            <l>In such a World, where they are made a scorn,</l>
            <l>Oppress'd by numerous Vice, mangled and torn,</l>
            <l>Wounded by Laughter, and by Wit forlorn.</l>
            <l>I mean not here by Wit, what's truly so,</l>
            <l>But that false Coin which does for Current go.</l>
            <l>'Tis certain but a few can Judgment make</l>
            <l>Of such a gift, which but a few partake.</l>
            <l>Ignorant Judges may decide a Cause,</l>
            <l>Sooner against, than for Concealed Laws.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:103161:131"/>
This is Wit's Pledge, but few those Precepts
know,</l>
            <l>Which many false Pretenders over-throw.</l>
            <l>And yet amongst those very few, there are</l>
            <l>Some who betray that Glorious Character;</l>
            <l>Whilst low-born Falshood goes for Heavenly
Wit;</l>
            <l>How many aim at what so few can hit?</l>
            <l>The Trade of Hell was never hard to get.</l>
            <l>Thus these Intruders double ends pursue,</l>
            <l>Rooting out Wit, they root out Vertue too.</l>
            <l>Soft pity passes now for Servile Fear,</l>
            <l>A generous scorn of Life for mean despair.</l>
            <l>Truth and Sincerity the Fools proclaim,</l>
            <l>Which witty falshood always load with shame.</l>
            <l>An Active Soul affected Notions prove,</l>
            <l>Out-flying common Thoughts, or private Love.</l>
            <l>Thus tho' each Vertue in it self they hate,</l>
            <l>They love to make it add to a Deceit.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:103161:132"/>
Undress'd 'tis scorn'd; but favour'd and allow'd,</l>
            <l>When to the Neighbouring Vice it lends a Cloud.</l>
            <l>Thus the Inconstant Empress of the Night,</l>
            <l>Tho' foul, and spotted, cloaths her self with
Light,</l>
            <l>And can with borrow'd Beams be always
bright.</l>

            <l>RAising my drooping Head, o'er charg'd
with Thought,</l>
            <l>Having each Scene of Life before me brought;</l>
            <l>I chid my self because I durst repine</l>
            <l>At Nature's Laws, or those that were Divine.</l>
            <l>Throughout the whole Creation 'tis the same,</l>
            <l>The Fuel is devoured by the Flame;</l>
            <l>Each peaceful, harmless, unoffending thing</l>
            <l>Is to the Offender made an Offering:</l>
            <l>Even God himself. Hold, my aspiring Thought;</l>
            <l>Descend, my Muse, thy flight too high is wrought;</l>
            <l>Tell not, how He, all peaceful, and all kind,</l>

Descend, I say, my Muse; low things afford</l>
            <l>Theams high enough for thee: Touch not the
Word,</l>
            <l>Till he hath touch'd thy Wings with Grace
Divine,</l>
            <l>Then, only his, thou shalt the World decline.</l>
            <l>The harmless Dove the Falcon doth betray;</l>
            <l>The Lamb is to the Wolf become a Prey;</l>
            <l>And Men to whom free will Heaven doth impart,</l>
            <l>To follow still the Counsels of his Heart,</l>
            <l>If wrack'd with doubt; if harmless, he designs</l>
            <l>Peace to his Heart, and still his Wish confines</l>
            <l>Justice to Peace, and Love to Quiet joyns.</l>
            <l>Why then the Dove-like Fate will sure be his;</l>
            <l>Short is his Life, unsettled is his Bliss:</l>
            <l>Hard Fate; that choice we eagerly pursue,</l>
            <l>Is, or to be undone, or to undo.</l>

            <head>ON THE
DEATH
OF
Mr. Abraham Cowley,
AND HIS
BURIAL
IN
Westminster-Abbey.</head>
            <byline>By the Earl of Orrery.</byline>
            <lg>
               <l>OUR Wit, till <hi>Cowley</hi> did its lustre raise,</l>
               <l>May be resembled to the first Three Days,</l>
               <l>In which did shine only such streaks of Light</l>
               <l>As serv'd but to distinguish Day from Night:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:103161:134"/>
But Wit breaks forth, in all that he has done,</l>
               <l>Like Light when 'twas united in the Sun.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Poets formerly did lie in wait</l>
               <l>To rifle those whom they would imitate:</l>
               <l>We Watch'd to rob all strangers when they writ,</l>
               <l>And learnt their Language but to steal their Wit.</l>
               <l>He from that need his Country does redeem,</l>
               <l>Since those who want may be supply'd from him;</l>
               <l>And Foreign Nations now may borrow more</l>
               <l>From <hi>Cowley,</hi> than we could from them before:</l>
               <l>Who though he condescended to admit</l>
               <l>The <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> for his Guides in Wit;</l>
               <l>Yet he those Ancient Poets does pursue,</l>
               <l>But as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> great <hi>Columbus</hi> do;</l>
               <l>He taught them first to the New World to steer,</l>
               <l>But they possess all that is precious there.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When first his Spring of Wit began to flow,</l>
               <l>It rais'd in some, Wonder and Sorrow too,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:103161:134"/>
That God had so much Wit and Knowledge
lent,</l>
               <l>And that they were not in his Praises spent.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But those who in his <hi>Davideis</hi> look,</l>
               <l>Find they his <hi>Blossoms</hi> for his <hi>Fruit</hi> mistook:</l>
               <l>In diff'ring Ages diff'rent Muses shin'd,</l>
               <l>His Green did Charm the Sense, his Ripe the
Mind.</l>
               <l>Writing for Heaven, he was inspir'd from
thence,</l>
               <l>And from his Theam deriv'd his Influence.</l>
               <l>The Scripture will no more the Wicked fright:</l>
               <l>His Muse does make Religion a Delight.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Oh how severely Man is us'd by Fate!</l>
               <l>The Covetous toil long for an Estate;</l>
               <l>And having got more than their Life can spend,</l>
               <l>They may bequeath it to a Son, or Friend:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:103161:135"/>
But Learning (in which none can have a share,</l>
               <l>Unless they climb to it by Time and Care,</l>
               <l>Learning, the truest Wealth which Man can
have)</l>
               <l>Does, with his Body, perish in his Grave:</l>
               <l>To Tenements of Clay it is confin'd,</l>
               <l>Tho' 'tis the Noblest Purchace of the Mind:</l>
               <l>Oh, why can we thus leave our Friends possest</l>
               <l>Of all our Acquisitions but the best?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Still when we study <hi>Cowley</hi> we lament,</l>
               <l>That to the World he was no longer lent;</l>
               <l>Who, like a Lightning, to our Eyes was
shown,</l>
               <l>So bright he shin'd, and was so quickly gone.</l>
               <l>Sure he rejoyc'd to see his flame expire,</l>
               <l>Since he himself could not have rais'd it higher;</l>
               <l>For when wise Poets can no higher flie,</l>
               <l>They would, like Saints, in their perfection die.</l>

               <l>Though Beauty some Affection in him bred,</l>
               <l>Yet only Sacred Learning he would wed;</l>
               <l>By which th' Illustrious Off-spring of his Brain,</l>
               <l>Shall over Wit's great Empire ever Reign:</l>
               <l>His Works shall Live, when Pyramids of Pride</l>

            <lg>

               <l>The best Good Man, that ever fill'd a Throne:</l>

Wisdom for Councils, Bravery in War,</l>
               <l>With all the mild Good-nature of the Fair.</l>
               <l>The Womans sweetness temper'd Manly Wit,</l>

               <l>With Wonders born, by Miracles preserv'd,</l>
               <l>A Heavenly Host the Infants Cradle serv'd.</l>
               <l>And Men His healing Empire's Omen read,</l>

agreed.</l>
               <l>His Youth for valorous Patience was renown'd,</l>
               <l>Like <hi>David,</hi> persecuted first, then Crown'd.</l>
               <l>Lov'd in all Courts, admir'd, where e'er he came,</l>
               <l>At once our Nation's Glory, and its Shame:</l>

They blest the <hi>Isle,</hi> where such great Spirits
dwell,</l>
               <l>Abhorr'd the Men, that could such worth expel.</l>
               <l>To spare our Lives, He meekly did defeat</l>

               <l>Unhappy <hi>Albion,</hi> by strange Ills opprest,</l>
               <l>In various Feavers tost, could find no rest:</l>
               <l>Quite spent and wearied, to His Arms She fled,</l>
               <l>And rested on His Shoulders, her fair bending

               <l>In Conquests Mild, He came from Exile
kind,</l>
               <l>No Climes, no Provocations, chang'd His Mind:</l>
               <l>No Malice show'd, no Hate, Revenge, or Pride,</l>
               <l>But <hi>Rul'd</hi> as <hi>Meekly,</hi> as His <hi>Father</hi> Dy'd;</l>
               <l>Eas'd us from endless Wars, made Discords cease,</l>
               <l>Restor'd to Quiet, and maintain'd in Peace:</l>
               <l>A mighty Series of new Time began,</l>
               <l>And rowling Years in joyful Circles ran.</l>
               <l>Then Wealth the City, business fill'd the Port,</l>
               <l>To Mirth our Tumults turn'd, our Wars to Sport:</l>
               <l>Then Learning flourish'd, blooming Arts did
spring,</l>
               <l>And the glad <hi>Muses</hi> prun'd their drooping wing.</l>
               <l>Then did our <hi>flying Towers</hi> improvement know,</l>
               <l>Who <hi>now</hi> command as far, as Winds can blow.</l>
               <l>With Canvass Wings round all the Globe they
fly,</l>
               <l>And, built by <hi>Charles</hi> His Art, all Storms defie:</l>
               <l>

To ev'ry Coast with ready Sails are hurl'd,</l>
               <l>Fill Us with Wealth, and with our Fame the
World:</l>
               <l>From whose Distractions Seas do us divide;</l>
               <l>Their Riches here in floating Castles ride.</l>
               <l>We reap the swarthy <hi>Indian</hi>'s Sweat and Toil,</l>
               <l>Their Fruit, without the mischiefs of their Soil.</l>
               <l>Here in cool Shades their Gold, and Pearls re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</l>
               <l>Free from the heat, which does their lustre give.</l>
               <l>In <hi>Persian</hi> Silks, eat <hi>Eastern</hi> Spice; secure</l>
               <l>From burning Fluxes, and their Calenture.</l>
               <l>Under our Vines upon the peaceful Shore,</l>
               <l>We see all <hi>Europe</hi> tost, hear Tempests roar:</l>
               <l>Rapine, Sword, Wars, and Famine rage abroad,</l>
               <l>While <hi>Charles</hi> their Host, like <hi>Jove</hi> from <hi>Ida,</hi>
aw'd;</l>
               <l>Us from our Foes, and from our selves did shield,</l>
               <l>Our Towns from Tumults, and from Arms the
Field.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:103161:139"/>
For, when bold Factions <hi>Goodness</hi> could disdain,</l>
               <l>Unwillingly He us'd a straiter Rein:</l>
               <l>In the <hi>still gentle Voice</hi> He lov'd to speak,</l>
               <l>But could with Thunder harden'd Rebels break.</l>
               <l>Yet though they wake't the Laws, His tender
Mind</l>
               <l>Was undisturb'd, in Wrath severely Kind.</l>
               <l>Tempting His Power, and urging to assume;</l>
               <l>Thus <hi>Jove</hi> in Love did <hi>Semele</hi> consume.</l>
               <l>As the Stout <hi>Oak,</hi> when round his Trunk the
Vine</l>
               <l>Does in soft wreaths, and amorous foldings twine,</l>
               <l>Easie and slight appears: The Winds from far</l>
               <l>Summon their noisie Forces to the War,</l>
               <l>But though so gentle seems his outward form,</l>
               <l>His hidden strength outbraves the loudest storm:</l>
               <l>Firmer he stands, and boldly keeps the Field,</l>
               <l>Showing stout Minds, when unprovok'd, are
mild.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:103161:139"/>
So when the <hi>Good Man</hi> made the Crowd pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume,</l>
               <l>He show'd himself, and did the <hi>King</hi> Assume:</l>
               <l>For Goodness in Excess may be a sin,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Justice</hi> must <hi>tame,</hi> whom <hi>Mercy</hi> cannot <hi>win.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Thus Winter fixes the unstable Sea,</l>
               <l>And teaches restless Water constancy,</l>
               <l>Which under the warm influence of bright days,</l>
               <l>The fickle motion of each Blast obeys.</l>
               <l>To bridle Factions, stop Rebellion's course,</l>
               <l>By easie Methods, vanquish without force,</l>
               <l>Relieve the Good, bold stubborn Foes subdue,</l>
               <l>Mildness in Wrath, Meekness in Anger shew,</l>
               <l>Were Arts, Great <hi>Charles</hi> His Prudence only
knew.</l>
               <l>To fright the Bad thus awful <hi>Thunder</hi> rolls;</l>
               <l>While the bright <hi>Bow</hi> secures the Faithful
Souls.</l>

               <l>Such is thy Glory, <hi>Charles,</hi> thy lasting Name,</l>
               <l>Brighter than our proud <hi>Neighbour</hi>'s guilty
Fame:</l>
               <l>More noble than the Spoils, that Battles yield,</l>
               <l>Or all the empty Triumphs of the Field.</l>
               <l>'Tis less to Conquer, than to make Wars cease,</l>
               <l>And without fighting, awe the World to Peace;</l>
               <l>For proudest Triumphs from Contempt arise,</l>
               <l>The vanquisht first the Conquerours Arms
despise,</l>
               <l>Won Ensigns are the gaudy marks of scorn,</l>
               <l>They brave the Victor first and then adorn.</l>
               <l>But peaceful Monarchs Reign like Gods; while
none</l>
               <l>Dispute, all Love, bless, Reverence their Throne.</l>
               <l>Tigers, and Bears, with all the Savage Host,</l>
               <l>May Boldness, Strength, and daring Conquest
boast:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:103161:140"/>
But the sweet Passions of a Generous Mind,</l>
               <l>Are the Prerogative of Humane kind,</l>
               <l>The God-like Image, on our Clay imprest,</l>
               <l>The Darling Attribute, which Heaven loves best.</l>

               <l>Oh! Had He more resembled It! Oh why</l>
               <l>Was He not still more like; and could not die?</l>
               <l>Now do our Thoughts alone enjoy His Name,</l>

               <l>The pleasing Emblem of his Reign does glide.</l>

               <l>Though no rich Sand in him, no Pearls are

               <l>Yet Fields rejoyce, his Meadows laugh around;</l>
               <l>Less Wealth his Bosom holds, less guilty stores,</l>

Mild, and Serene, the peaceful Current flows,</l>
               <l>No angry foam, no raging Surges knows.</l>
               <l>No dreadful Wreck upon his Banks appears,</l>
