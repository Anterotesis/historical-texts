            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>In the ſame Year 1670. the Claymant humbly addreſſed himſelf by Petition to His <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Majeſty for redreſs in that matter, who was graciouſly pleaſed to ſend Sir <hi>John Birkenhead</hi> to the ſaid Attorney General, to demand of him from his Majeſty why he did not ſign the Claymants <hi>Quo Warranto;</hi> who returned for anſwer, <hi>That he could n<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This Anſwer of the Attorney Generalls being ſignifyed to His Majeſty, he was pleaſed expreſly to refer the Clymant to Sir <hi>Edward Walker</hi> and Sir <hi>John Bir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenhead,</hi> to inquire and ſearch into the Claymants Pedigree; for which purpoſe the Claymant attended them with his Councel Mr. Serjeant <hi>Brampſton,</hi> where the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was debated; and there then appearing ſome difficulty to find with certainty, who was the Claymants Great Grandfather: It was the joynt adviſe of Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Walker,</hi> Sir <hi>John Birkenhead,</hi> and Serjeant <hi>Brampſton,</hi> That the Claymant ſhould at adventure Clayme under ſome one of the Family of the <hi>Percies,</hi> and not delay his proſecution any longer; they all then declaring to the Claymant, that in caſe he pitcht upon a wrong Perſon to Clayme from, yet it could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the Claymant; for that on the contrary would be a means <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> out the Right Perſon.</p>
            <p>Purſuant to this Advice, the Claymant took his deſcent from Sir <hi>Richard Percy</hi> as his Great Grandfather; and the matter thereon coming to be heard before the Lords in Parliament, Sir <hi>Richard Percy</hi> appeared to be too young to be the Clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mants Great Grandfather; Serjeant <hi>Pemberton</hi> then of Counſel with the Claymant, Informed their Lordſhips of the Reaſon and Advice aforeſaid of the Claymants fixing upon Sir <hi>Richard Percy</hi> as his Great Grandfather; and that notwithſtanding the miſtake, yet the ſame could not, nor ought really to prejudice the Claymant,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57766:6"/>
as to any definitive Sentence to be paſſed thereon by their Lordſhips, againſt the Claymant; For that the matter of the Claymants Right and Claim ought firſt to be Tryed in the Inferiour Courts; and in caſe the Truth of the matter could not be found out and determined at Law, then (and not before) it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for their Lordſhips Judgment and Determination; with which their Lordſhips were ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>Upon this the Claymants Adverſaries procured to be Publiſhed in the Gazets, That the Claymant was an <hi>Impoſtor;</hi> and at their Courts, declared to the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, That his Name was not <hi>Percy,</hi> but that he was a Baſtard, and that they could prove, that <hi>Henry Percy,</hi> who he declared was his Father, was never marryed: the Conſequence of which evil, and unheard of practices, Was</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> Rendring the Claymant Odious to the World. And</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> Through the foul practice of the Claymants Sollicitor, there was a miſinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation given unto His Late Gracious Majeſty of ever Bleſſed Memory, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon gave the Title and Land away, which multiplied not only Enemies, but Power againſt the Claymants Juſt demands: In Order to the removing theſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles, convincing the World of the Malice of his Adverſaries, and clear himſelf of theſe vile Imputations, to aſſert his undoubted Right to the Honours and Earldom of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> the Claymant brought his Action of Scandal againſt Mr. <hi>John Clerk</hi> one of the Adverſaries principal Agents.</p>
            <p>In 1674. The Cauſe came to Tryal <hi>(Clerk</hi> having for a long time before ſheltred himſelf under Priviledges of Parliament) where notwithſtanding the Claymant prov'd himſelf Legitimate by Father, Mother, Grandfather and Grandmother; yet the Claymants Attorney, with coluſion, and without the Claymants conſent, ſuffered a Non-Suite; upon which the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hale,</hi> ſtood up and declared his diſſatisfaction thereat; ſaying in open Court, <hi>That the Claymant had fully proved himſelf a true</hi> Percy, <hi>by Father, Mother, Grandfather and Grandmother, and of the Blood and Family of the</hi> Percyes <hi>of</hi> Northumberland, <hi>and that he did verily believe the Claymant was Couſin, and next Heir Male to</hi> Joſceline Percy <hi>late Earl of</hi> Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland? <hi>only he was afraid, he had taken his Deſcent a little too low.</hi> Nay, the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (then Impanneld, and ſworn upon the Tryal; after the Tryal, had a Treat given them by the Adverſaries) declared thus to <hi>Clark</hi> the Defendant in the Suit: Sir, <hi>You are beholding to the Claymant</hi> James Percy, <hi>for ſuffering a Non-Suit; for truly, otherwiſe we muſt have given a Verdict againſt you for him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Pedigree was proved ſo clear.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> Immediately after this Tryal was over, the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> riſen, and the Judge going to his Coach, the late Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> meeting him at his Coach, ſayd thus to the Judge, <hi>My Lord, I hear Mr.</hi> Percyes <hi>Tryal was to day; I pray, What do you think of him? To which the Lord Chief Juſtice</hi> Hales, (with much earneſtneſs) replied, <hi>I verily believe he hath as much right to the Earldom of</hi> Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland, <hi>as I have to this Coach and Horſes which I have bought and paid for;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>☞ <hi>Note,</hi> The Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> when he was Lord Chancellor of <hi>England</hi> was by Agreement with ſome of the Adverſaries to have had Lands of the <hi>Percies</hi> to the value of <hi>30000ll.</hi> for what purpoſe let the prudent and unprejudiced judge.</p>
            <p>After this, the Claymant (purſuant to Judge <hi>Hale's</hi> Intimation) endeavoured to ſearch higher for his Pedigree, and for that purpoſe repaired to the Right Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and truely Noble and Vertuous the then Counteſs of <hi>Dorſet, Pembroke</hi> and <hi>Montgomery</hi> at <hi>Appleby-Caſtle,</hi> at ſuch time as Judge <hi>Wild</hi> and Judge <hi>Ellis</hi> (in their Circuit) Dined there; when and where (after a long diſcourſe had between the ſaid Counteſs and the Claymant touching his Claym to the Earldom of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and inquiry after his great Grandfather) the Counteſs in the preſence of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57766:7"/>
Sir <hi>Thomas Stringer,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Otway,</hi> ſaid thus to the Claymant: <hi>If you be of Kin to me, you muſt be Deſcended from thoſe Children that were ſent into the</hi> South <hi>in Hampers, in the Troubleſom times, in Queen</hi> Flizabeth's <hi>Dayes;</hi> which proved a happy intimation to the Claymant, for thereby he at laſt arrived to the knowledge of his Great Grand Father, as in the Pedigree.</p>
            <p>Some ſhort time after this, the Claymant brought an Action in Ejectment, in the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> for <hi>Cannington,</hi> and <hi>Rodway</hi> in <hi>Somerſetſh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Now (at this Tryal with Sir <hi>John Coppleſton)</hi> the Clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant proved by Mr. <hi>Henry Champion</hi> (who kept the Books and Records for <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gernoon</hi> Tenth, and <hi>Jocelin</hi> Eleventh Earls of <hi>Northumberland)</hi> that he found in thoſe Books and Records, that Sir <hi>Ingelram Percy</hi> was Married, and had Sons and Daughters: And the Court then Declared, That the Claymant had fully proved his Pedigree, and Right of Claim, and willed him to proceed to the Title of the Lands in queſtion; unto which, the Claymants Councel replyed, They had proved his Pedigree and Right; and conceived the Lands muſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that, and that they relying therein, were not prepared nor Inſtructed to proceed further, than to prove the Claymants Legal Lineal Deſcent. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, for want of certain Evidences and Records touching the ſame Lands, then in the Defendants Cuſtody; a Non-ſuit was had againſt the Claymant, and <hi>Seventy</hi> Pound Coſts Awarded.</p>
            <p>☞ <hi>Note,</hi> Upon payment of theſe Coſts, Sir <hi>John Coppleſton</hi> Offered to the Claymant, That if he would relinquiſh his Right to thoſe Lands in <hi>Sommerſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> he ſhould have ſome conſideration for the ſame; and further, That he the ſaid Sir <hi>John Coppleſton,</hi> would furniſh the Claymant with ſuch Writings as ſhould enable him to recover above 5000. <hi>Per Annum,</hi> good Lands.</p>
            <p>The Claymant brought another Action of Scandal againſt one Mr. <hi>Wright,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Adverſaries Agents, for the like Scandalous words with thoſe ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by <hi>Clark.</hi> This Cauſe was tryed before the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Rainsford,</hi> where the Claymant proved his Legitimacy and Pedigree by ſeveral Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs; ſo fully and clearly; and to that fullneſs and Satisfaction, that before he had Examined half his Witneſſes, the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Rainsford</hi> ſtood up, and ſaid, <hi>You Gentlemen of the Jury, We need not trouble the Court further in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining any more of the Plaintiffs Witneſſes, by reaſon his Pedigr<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

            <p>In <hi>June</hi> 1676.

            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 7. 1677. Appointed by the Court for Tryal, and the Maſter of the Office atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by both ſides, &amp; a Jury ſtruck, &amp; the Claymant prepared for Tryal, &amp; brought
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57766:8"/>
up <hi>Sixty-Five</hi> Witneſſes; ſeveral of which came from the moſt remote parts of the Kingdom; the Travel in Sommoning, and bringing them to <hi>London,</hi> above <hi>Four Thouſand</hi> Miles: The Charges thereof, and in retaining, and feeing fourteen Councels for the Tryal, amounting to above <hi>Four Hundred</hi> Pounds.</p>
            <p>At the day appointed, the Claymant attended with his Counſel and Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, prepared for Tryal; when the Defendants Counſel Inſiſted, the Defendant was priviledged, as Agent of the Counteſs-Dowager of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> that he was Steward of her Courts, and Receiver of her Rents; and therefore if the Claymants Councel proceeded to the Tryal, it ſhould be at their Perils; which ſo awed them, that they refuſed to Plead; declaring, they had no mind to go to the <hi>Tower:</hi> Some of them having been there upon the like occaſion before. And ſo the Tryal was put off; at which the Court ſeemed much diſatisfied; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, Mr. Juſtice <hi>Wild</hi> ſtood up in open Court, declaring his reſentment of the Adverſaryes practiſes in theſe words, <hi>viz. Fye, fye, Gentlemen; Is this a time to inſiſt upon Priviledges; when you forc't the Plaintiff to this Tryal, and have put him to ſo great Expence, Travel, and Labour? You do but caſt cold Water upon your Cauſe. It is not the firſt time this Cauſe hath been before this Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, <hi>Blackeſton</hi> ſheltring himſelf under the late Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s priviledge, (the Counteſs Dowagers being taken off by Order of the Houſe of Lords upon another occaſion) the Clayment Petitioned the Houſe of Lords to diſcharge <hi>Blakeſtons</hi> priviledge, under the Earl; whereupon an Agreement was made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Earl, and the Clayments Councel; that the Clayment paying Ninety Pound Coſts into Court (then unpaid upon the Non-ſuit againſt <hi>Clarke) Blake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi> ſhould not ſtand upon Priviledge, but go forth-with to Tryal; whereupon the Claymant paid the Ninety Pound Coſts into Court, there to remain, until a fair Tryal had; and the <hi>11th.</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> 1678. the Tryal came on, and after opening of the Cauſe, the Defendants Councel took Exceptions to ſome Point in the Declaration, which, after a debate, was waved; the Action judged to be well laid, and the ſcandalous Words proved.</p>
            <p>Then the Claymants Councel proceeded to call Witneſſes, to pove his Pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree upwards, as being the better way to ſatisfy the Court, and inform the Jury; and that the Claymant could not poſſibly Arrive at, any preſent better way to prove his Pedigree, than by his Action of Slander; For that the Claymant had before that delivered Declarations in Ejectment in ſeveral Counties, but the Lands being all in the hands of great Perſonages, ſtopt his Proceedings, on ſuch Ejectments by Priviledge, which Candidneſs of the Claymants Councel was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably made uſe of to the Claymants great Damage. For hereupon Draughts of the Claymants Pedigree being delivered to the Judges, the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs</hi> ſaid, <hi>What need you trouble the Court to Examine all theſe Witneſſes, if there be no Lands, therefore let us ſee firſt, what Lands there are.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the Claymant produced divers Records out of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and elſewhere; which evidenced, that the Lands (late the Lady <hi>Lucy's</hi> in <hi>Cumberland,</hi> and other Counties, in the Records eſpecially named) were Settled upon the Heirs-Males of the <hi>Percyes</hi> for ever, tendring <hi>three Hundred</hi> Pounds to the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the ſaid <hi>Lucyes</hi> Coat of Armes next their own, and before the <hi>Percyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the Defendants Councel ſtarted up an Attainder of Sir <hi>Thomas Percy</hi> in King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Eighth</hi>'s time, alſo his Son in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which being new to the Claymant, and therefore his Councel not prepared pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to anſwer, time was given to the Clayment, to Inform and prepare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to anſwer that matter; and a further day appointed for Tryal, and the Jury then Sworn, with-drawn; and after that, two ſeveral dayes appointed for Tryal, and alſo a third day, to wit, the <hi>27th.</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> 1678. But</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:57766:9"/>
The firſt day of <hi>Hillary</hi> Term, 1678. the Defendants Councel moved the Court, for a new Jury, and alſo for a further day for Tryal; both which the Court granted. Yet after all this, the Defendant moved again for a longer day, which was granted, until <hi>Thurſday</hi> the <hi>6th.</hi> of <hi>February.</hi> Notwithſtanding all which, and that the Claymant had (at a vaſt Expence) kept his Witneſſes in Town, all this time, yet would not the Court Award him any Coſts.</p>
            <p>☞ <hi>Note,</hi> In the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hayles</hi> time, it was otherwiſe; for, in the Suit brought as aforeſaid againſt <hi>Clarke,</hi> the Defendant moving to put off that Tryal for ſeven days, on pretence he was not prepared; the Court Awar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Defendant to pay the Clayman<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Thirty Five</hi> Pound Coſts, in reſpect of the Charge of keeping his Witneſſes in Town, before any further time gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for Tryal; and which was paid accordingly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixth</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> 1678. The New <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ury appeared, and the Tryal came on again; the Cauſe opened, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd one of the Witneſſes called to prove the Words; who appearing, the Court declared he had ſufficiently proved them before. So no Exception being made thereunto, or to any matter in the Declaration, by the Defendants Councel: It was Agreed to proceed, and take up the Caſe, where they left at the former Tryal, the <hi>11th.</hi> of <hi>November.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon Copys of the Records of the Patents in Queen <hi>Maryes</hi> time <hi>(viz.)</hi> One for the Barony, and th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> other for the Earldom, were produced. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, the Defendants Councel Objected the Attainder of <hi>Thomas Percy.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which, the Claymants Councel inſiſted, and Evidenced, That the Claymants Deſcent and Claim was Paramount the Attainder, and that the ſame could not, in any ſort, affect the Claymant, and which was admitted by the Court.</p>
            <p>This Point being thus Cleared, the Claymant deſcended to Examine his Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to prove his Pedigree, but the Defendants Councel declared, They admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and owned the Claymants Pedigree and Title, but that could not Affect the Lands, for that by an Act of Parliament touching Exchange of Lands between King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Eighth,</hi> and <hi>Henry Percy</hi> the <hi>Sixth</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and others, the Limitations in the Settlement, under whom the Claymant Claymed, were deſtroyed. But this Point being alſo anſwered, as well by ſeveral Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings in that Act, as otherwiſe; and the Claymant Preſſing, That he might be permitted to Examine his Witneſſes, to prove his Pedigree, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the Cauſe: The Defendant then reſorted to their firſt piece of Craft, and Inſiſted upon a pretended Inſufficiency in the Declaration, and which had been debated, and waved as aforeſaid; but the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs</hi> now falling in with them, would not ſuffer the Claymants Witneſſes to be Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as to his Pedigree; but on the contrary, Cryed out <hi>The Declaration is nought, the Declaration is nought;</hi> whereupon, the Claymant was driven to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a Non-Suit.</p>
            <p>After this, the Claymant brought an Ejectment, for recovery of that part of the Eſtate belonging to the Earldom, called the Lady <hi>Lucyes</hi> Lands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in 1681. brought the ſame to Tryal at the <hi>Kings-Bench-Bar,</hi> where the Claymant ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved his Pedigree; and ſo was Declared by the Court; But by the evil Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes of the Adverſaries, with the Perſon that managed the Cauſe for the Clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant; and his not producing, at the Tryal, the Copy of the Grants, made by <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi> to the Earls of <hi>Northumberland;</hi> for want thereof, and ſome other Records the ſaid Agent was entruſted with, by the Claymant, the ſaid Tryal paſſed againſt the Claymant. The then Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Pemberton</hi> ſtanding up in Court, and ſaying to the Claymant, <hi>Mr.</hi> Percy, <hi>Your Cauſe is ill managed, ſuffer a Non-ſuit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

Agents, one Mr. <hi>James Hooton,</hi> the Claymant loſt the benefit of two Writs of Error brought in the Houſe of Lords.</p>
            <p>By theſe Methods the Claymant proceeded in the Courts of Law ſingly.</p>
            <p>Now for Equity and Law together:</p>
            <p>The Earldom of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> being heretofore endowed by his Majeſty's Anceſtors, with an Annual Rent or Fee of <hi>Twenty</hi> Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> payable by the Sheriff of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> out of the County.</p>
            <p>In order to the Recovery thereof, and Affirmance of the Claymants Title, he exbibited his Bill in his Majeſties Court of <hi>Exchecquer,</hi> againſt <hi>Edmond Crai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> the then Sheriff of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> for Recovery of the ſaid <hi>Twenty</hi> Pounds <hi>per Annum;</hi> not in the leaſt doubting, but to bring the Merits of that Cauſe to a ſpeedy Iſſue; but on the contrary, notwithſtanding, the Sheriff was otherwiſe an uninterreſſed Party then, only as the hand to pay the <hi>Twenty</hi> pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> to the Claymant, and have it again allowed in his Accounts. Yet the Spirit and Practiſes that had hitherto oppoſed the Claymant, in his Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting his juſt Right in the Courts of Law, appears in this alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that the World may ſee it plainly, take this following Account of thoſe Proceedings, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Trinity-Term,</hi> 1682. The Bill was fyled againſt Mr. <hi>Craiſter,</hi> who appears, but ſits in Contempt for not anſwering; whereupon four ſeveral Attachments iſſued againſt him, directed to the Coroner of the County of <hi>Northumberland;</hi> but before any Obedience would be given thereunto, or Execution procured there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Claymant (Plaintiff in the Cauſe) was neceſſitated to be at the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Expence of ſending Perſons on purpoſe, from <hi>London</hi> into <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to procure the ſame to be Executed.</p>

            <p>Upon this Petition, the Court ordered, That if <hi>Craiſter</hi> did not pay the Coſts by a day certain in <hi>Michaelmas-Term,</hi> 1684. then all the former Amerciaments to be forthwith Levyed, and a further Amerciament ſet.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all which, the Plaintiff was put to the Charge of ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Motions for the Coſts; and they not paid until the beginning of <hi>Hillary-Term</hi> laſt.</p>
            <p>9 <hi>January</hi> 1684. The Claymant, by Petition, humbly Addreſſed himſelf to his late Sacred Majeſty, and the Lords of his Privy-Council, briefly ſetting forth the ſaid Matters in the Suit againſt <hi>Craiſter;</hi> and that the proceedings of <hi>Craiſter</hi> (and the Coroner) were in notorious Contempt of His Majeſties Dignity and Authority; and tended not only to the bringing His Majeſties Courts of Juſtice into Contempt, but to the Obſtruction of Juſtice in general, and utter Ruin of the Claymant in particular.</p>
            <p>Upon this Petition the Claymant received a Gracious verbal Anſwer, That the whole Matter of the Petitioners Cauſe ſhould be heard and determined in the next enſuing Parliament.</p>
            <p>That it being neceſſary to make his ſaid late Majeſty, by his Attorney General,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57766:12"/>
a Deſendant to the Claymant's ſaid Bill, in the Court of <hi>Exchequer,</hi> he made humble Application to the ſaid <hi>Attorney General,</hi> to put in an Anſwer thereunto; but hath not hitherto been ſo happy, as to obtain the ſame; whereby the Claymants further proceedings in that Cauſe, are at a full ſtop.</p>
            <p>Now it remains, that the Claymant anſwer ſome <hi>Objections</hi> much inſiſted on by his Adverſary: As,</p>
            <p>Object. I. <hi>That the Claymant, at firſt, derived his Pedigree from Sir</hi> Richard Percy, <hi>as his Great Grand-Father, and afterwards from Sir</hi> Ingleram Percy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is admitted to be true in Fact; but the occaſion of deriving from <hi>Richard Percy,</hi> was:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Matches of the <hi>Percies</hi> were rent out of the <hi>Heralds</hi> Book, and Sir <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleram Percy</hi>'s was quite leſt out of the Firſt Pedigree.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Misfortunes of the Family of the <hi>Percies</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> Time; and thereby, thoſe of them under whom the Claymant is immediately Deſcended, dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of their Native Country, and from their Father's Houſe, in a moſt obſcure manner, meerly for Preſervation of their Lives in their tender Years.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The taking away the <hi>Court of Wards</hi> and <hi>Inquiſitions, poſt mortem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The Interruption in the Executing the Office of <hi>Heralds,</hi> in <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Times of the late Rebellion.</p>

               </gap> poſſeſſing themſelves of all the <hi>Memorandums</hi> and <hi>Records</hi> of the late <hi>Earls of Northumberland, Algernoon</hi> and <hi>Ioſcelin,</hi> and the Pedigrees and Deſcents of that Family.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Advice above-ſaid, given to the Claymant by Sir <hi>Edward Walker,</hi> Sir <hi>John Berkenhead,</hi> and the Claymant's Councel, to fix upon a Wrong Party, as the only way to find out the Right; and which, in truth, had the hoped-for Effect. Nor is this an <hi>Objection</hi> with any knowing, intelligent, unbyaſs'd Perſon; it being a thing frequently in practice in the Courts of Law.</p>
            <p>Object. II. <hi>The Obſcureneſs of the Claymant, and Meanneſs of his Profeſſion, having been a Trunk-maker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Obſcureneſs was, as before is ſaid, from the Misfortunes and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties of the Family of the <hi>Percies,</hi> in the troubleſome Times of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is it any real Diſreputation upon any Noble Family; the ſupporting Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies by Lawful Callings, though never ſo mean, being eſteemed a Virtue by all virtuous Perſons: And it's moſt frequent in the Nobleſt Families in <hi>Germany<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> To Train up their Sons in the learning Handicraft-Trades. Nor can any thing but Vice, diſparage True Nobility. Beſides, the Matter in Controverſie, is not, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Claymant was of this, or that Trade? but, Whether he be Couſin, and next Heir Male to <hi>Joſcelin Percy,</hi> late Earl of <hi>Northumberland;</hi> which he hath at ſeveral Tryals, and in ſeveral Courts, proved to full Satisfaction of the ſaid Courts, by all the Methods and Ways imaginable?</p>
            <p>As by Proof of his Lineal Deſcent, and the Ownings and Declarations of the late Earls of <hi>Northumberland, Algernoon</hi> and <hi>Ioſcelin;</hi> That the Claymant (by the Appellation of <hi>James Percy,</hi> the Trunk-maker at <hi>Dublin)</hi> was of the Blood and Family of the <hi>Percies,</hi> and next Heir Male, after the ſaid <hi>Ioſcelin,</hi> to the Earldom; and by divers other unanſwerable Proofs.</p>
            <p>This being the True State of the Claymant's Right and Title to the ſaid Earldom, and of the Means by which he has endeavour'd to Recover his ſaid Right; wherein he hath been obſtructed by the Powerfulneſs of his Adverſaries, and the Corruption of his Agents: He humbly ſubmits to the Great Wiſdom, Honour, and Juſtice of the <hi>King</hi>'s moſt Sacred Majeſty, and the <hi>Lords</hi> Spiritual and Temporal, in <hi>Parliament</hi> Aſſembled, (and where it's not poſſible, there can be any Failer of Juſtice) for Relief and Redreſs in the Premiſes.</p>
