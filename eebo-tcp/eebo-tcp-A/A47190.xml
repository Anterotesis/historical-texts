            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHereas I have been lately accuſed by a certain Perſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore divers Witneſſes, for being the Author of a certain Book, called, <hi>The Two Hundred Queries,</hi> printed at <hi>London</hi> eight Years a go, his Proof being, <hi>That four or five Years ago he had it from my own Mouth</hi>; but being put to bring Evidence from Witneſſes, he ſaid, <hi>He could prove it by ſuch Circumſtances which I told him, that I could not deny.</hi> I anſwered him; It being ſo many Years ago, he might

juſtly queſtion his Memory, ſeeing when I called him to bear witneſs to things he had heard ſpoken but ſome few days or weeks paſt, he hath ſaid, <hi>He could not remember them, his Memory being weak, and he had rather forget than remember ſuch things.</hi> He did alſo further charge me, <hi>That he heard me ſay, I believed I ſhould be moved of God to preach the Doctrine of the Revol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tions, as he termed it</hi>; but what Revolutions I meant, he did not tell; for there are many Revolutions, and of many ſorts; The which I do not remember I ever ſaid to him; and as he may underſtand the Revolutions, his ſo charging me may be an utter Falſhood and Slander; for there are ſome ſorts of Revolutions relating to the Souls of men, that cannot be denyed, if we own the <hi>Reſurrection of the dead,</hi> according to Scripture, and our conveyance and deſcent out of the Loyns of our Anceſtors up to <hi>Adam,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Scriptures; ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 46.26. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 12.4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 9, 10, and the word <hi>Revolution,</hi> is the true Engliſh of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word Gilgal, mentioned <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 10.13. and this with reſpect to men (ſee the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, and Margen of the Engliſh Bible; alſo, the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Tehupha</hi> is tranſlated three ſeveral times [Revolution] by the Tranſlators of our Engliſh Bible, and ſet on the Margen by them; ſee <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.22.1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.20.2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.23. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I declared, That I did not remember that ever I owned my ſelf to be the Author of that Book, or that I ſaid, I did believe, that I ſhould be moved of God to preach the Revolutions; but on the contrary, ſeeing I do not remember it, and my Memory is as good as his, if not better, I did and do hold it to be raſhly and fooliſhly charged by him, and for which he may be accounted a falſe Accuſer; nor can I think whatever I ſaid ſuch a thing, becauſe I never made the Opinion of the Revolutions, as delivered in that Book, or as vulgarly held by its Aſſerters, a matter of my Faith, or as any divine Opening; beſides, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is varying the Charge, as Witneſſes can prove, ſaying firſt, <hi>I knew not but I might be moved, </hi> and laſt ſaying, <hi>I believed I ſhould be moved, &amp;c.</hi> which differ widely, and make the whole juſtly incredible. But he did ſo earneſtly aſſert them, that he ſaid, <hi>As God was in Heaven it was true</hi>; which ſome of us that heard him, were greatly offended with, judging it to be an Oath, as that Oath or manner of Swearing under the Law, <hi>As the Lord liveth,</hi> Jer. 5.2. And I ſaid to him, this is more than Yea or Nay, which Chriſt hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to keep unto in all our Communications, for whatſoever is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95313:2"/>
more than theſe, cometh of Evil; and many of us have ſuffered much in Old <hi>England</hi> for refuſing to ſwear in any caſe, even before a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate. However, let it be conſidered, whether it be not a Breach of all common Civility or Morality among men, to make Publick a thing ſecretly ſpoken (if the thing had been ſpoke by me, as he affirmeth) that he thought might tend to my Prejudice; nor doth it excuſe him, to ſay, <hi>I lately told ſome-what he ſpoke to me in private</hi>; for that was ſuch a thing he might have ſpoke to any, and did not tend to his, or any mans Prejudice, and was no ſecrecy. And whether his aſſerting a thing without any Proof, but what we take to be a very great Oath, will be any ſufficient Witneſs or Evidence, in point of common Juſtice among men? for if this be allowed, not only m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ns Fame and Reputation, but Property, Liberty and Life it ſelf lieth a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſtake to be taken away moſt unjuſtly.</p>
            <p>But to anſwer directly to his Charge; I do ſay, after the beſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of my Memory that I can make, after ſo many Years paſt, I do not remember that I ſaid to him, I was the Author of that book, and I know not how he can juſtly think, conſidering theſo very Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtances he alledgeth, and ſome other Circumſtances whereof he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ignorant, unleſs he hath forgotten the whole; for I told him, that divers Perſons were concerned in that Book, called, <hi>The Two Hundred Queries,</hi> and after what manner. Beſides, another Perſon hath in Print divers Years ago owned that Book; and why then ſhould he charge me with that which another hath owned. The moſt he can juſtly alledge, is, <hi>That I ſaid a conſiderable part of the Matter of that Book, which I had from another, I put into Writing</hi>; which will not prove me to be the Author; for I oft put into writing other mens words, even ſuch as are Adverſaries; and many do write for others that whereof they are not the Authors. But I further ſay, I never juſtly could, nor do own my ſelf to be the Author of that Book (how far I might be concerned otherwiſe in it, in any part or in the writing of a great part of the Matter of it, is not material nor neceſſary for me to determine, for others were concerned; and he who accuſeth me of a thing which he cannot prove by outward Evidence, by ſo doing rather proveth himſelf a falſe Accuſer, and ſhoweth both his own Folly and Prejudice againſt me: And I ſay yet further, as no man living can prove me to be the Author of that Book, ſo I had not the leaſt hand in the Printing it; for it was printed altogether without
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95313:3"/>
my Conſent and Approbation, and the Defaults (whether in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ranſcribing, or in the Printing it,) are ſo many, that it hath quite <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>red the ſence of the Queries in many places, and made others of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>em Non-ſenſical; and there are things in it for which I am no wiſe accountable, and which I never did own, or do own to be mine; yet I cannot diſown or blame the whole, but make a diſtinction; for there are things queried in that Book, that are no wiſe unbecoming the beſt Chriſtians, and which mention nothing of the Revolutions, ſo called, nor doth imply them, except by ſuch remote ſeeming Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, which one may as readily deny, as another may affirm, and they have no more neceſſary connexion with the Revolutions, than the Scriptures have, that are cited in them; and I am not convinced, that it is a Treſpaſs to query things that call not into Queſtion any one Article of the <hi>Christian Faith.</hi> But further, to clear the matter, I do affirm, that I never ſaid to any, nor did I ever conclude in my thoughts, that the Doctrine of the Revolutions, as they are commonly underſtood, or as delivered in that Book, was the matter of my Faith, or were things inwardly revealed or opened to me by the Spirit of Truth, as I am free to ſay concerning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all things of my <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> which I both believe and profeſs; nor have I ever had any Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, Strife or Contention with any man about the Revolutions, ſo called, and I have been very ſhy and backward, either to lend or recommend the ſaid Book. But it is one thing what a man may ſuppoſe to be a probable Opinion, or rational Hypotheſis (either as touching the Doctrine of the Revolutions, of which there are many ſorts aſſerted by Authors, or as touching any other Doctrine in Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy or Phyſick) and it is far another thing what a man aſſerts to be his Chriſtian Faith, grounded upon the inward Evidence and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Gods Spirit in the Heart.</p>
            <p>But as to my real ſence of the Opinion of that called the Revolutions, which do generally relate to Times paſt (and not with the leaſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty to any one particular Perſon to the time to come) ever ſince the Death of Chriſt. If any hold any such Opinion or Doctrine of them (as I know none that do,) that doth teach, <hi>That men may delay their Repentance, or living a good Life, in hope that they ſhall live again after Death:</hi> I do ſincerely declare, I have alwayes abhorred any ſuch Doctrine, and judged it Wicked and Abominable, and ſtill I do ſo judge, and hope ſo to do while I live, and I have upon many
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95313:3"/>
occaſions born my zealous Teſtimony, both in publick and in private to the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That to entertain any ſuch hope, to live again in order to Repent, and live a good Life, after a man has neglected the preſent Opportunity wherein to Repent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in this preſent Life, is as Wicked as it is vain; for <hi>The Grace of God that bringeth Salvation teacheth us to deny <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodliness and Worldly Luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent World, Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. But it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no man to delay his good living to any time after Death, either in hope of a Purgatory, while the Soul is out of the Body, or in hope to live again in a mortal Body; for <hi>NOW is the accepted Time, NOW is the Day of Salvation,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.2. <hi>And it is the last Time,</hi> as <hi>John</hi> hath declared, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.18. And alſo <hi>Paul, ſaying, Rom.</hi> 13.11. <hi>And that knowing the Time, that NOW it is high Time to awake out of ſleep, &amp;c. let us therefore caſt off the Works of Darkness, and put on the Armour of Light, for the Times of Ignorance God wincked at, but NOW com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enandeth all men every where to Repent,</hi> Acts 17.30. And as <hi>John</hi> ſaid, Mat. 3. 10. <hi>And NOW alſo the Ax is laid to the Root of the Trees, therefore eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y Tree that bringeth not forth good Fruit, is hewn down, and caſt into the Fire.</hi> And therefore if any hold ſuch Doctrine of Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, that putteth men upon delaying their Repentance, or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting to live a good Life, in hope to live again after Death, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and Amend, as I have alwayes abhorred it, ſo I hope I ſhall alwayes do, and bear my faithful Teſtimony againſt it.</p>
            <p>And whereas the ſaid Perſon hath accuſed me before divers Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>That my manner of Preaching the Faith of Chriſt Crucified and Raiſed again, its being neceſſary to make men Chriſtians and Sons of God of the Free Woman, and Children of the New-Covenant, doth infer my holding of the Revolutions, to wit, that all pious</hi> Gentiles, <hi>dying without all bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christ crucified and raiſed again preached to them, muſt of neceſſity live again in a mortal Body, in order to hear that Doctrine outwardly preached to them, or then be damned.</hi> The which Alternative I poſſitively deny. And by this his Accuſation, he hath ſhown what a Changeling he is, from better to worſe, in ſo finding fault with my Doctrine for Preaching or Printing the neceſſity of this Faith to Salvation, which he hath ſo frequently held forth himſelf &amp; owned and approved in my Books. And I propoſe it to the ſerious Conſideration of all ſincere <hi>Christians,</hi> Whether this Difficulty ſhow much ſo ever

real or ſeeming) doth more pinch or ſtraiten me, than all Chriſtendom that univerſally aſſert the neceſſity of faith in Chriſt crucified and raiſed again, to make men true and ſincere <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and that by this Faith men are juſtified, ſanctified, and attain to eternal Life; and that therefore no <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Turk</hi> can be a true <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> becauſe they have not this Faith, however otherwiſe juſt and conſcientious they may be? And whether, ſeeing the whole ſtrain and current of the Scripture, both of the Old and New Teſtament, is ſuch as doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the neceſſity of this Faith and Goſpel to be preached to all Nations, to wit, That Chriſt Jeſus the Son of God dyed for our ſins, and roſe again for our Juſtification; and that it is plain from expreſs Scripture, That this Juſtification is not obtained, nor Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation (to wit) finally, fully and perfectly, without this Faith; I ſay, Whether in oppoſition to, and in prejudice of the Revolutions, and for avoiding that Doctrine, and laying it aſide, we muſt and ought to lay aſide the Preaching and Faith of Chriſt as he outwardly dyed for our ſins on the Tree of the Croſs, and roſe again for our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
