         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I thanke you hartely of your good opinion, but chiefely I ioy in this: that you and I agrée in the onely ground and foundation of true and perfect amitye, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hence the cauſes of all noble actions whatſoeuer doe flowe: that whatſoeuer we purpoſe, attempt, and aduenture, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth wholy in the excellencye of the minde, and of that part of the minde, which reaſon perſwadeth, pietye directeth, honor rewardeth, felicitye crowneth.</p>

               <p>What meane you ſyr, where you ſay of that part of the minde? Is not the minde a complete and entire thing? Is it not in his proper nature moſt pure, and frée

               <p>The minde according to the opinion of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers (the true and diligent ſearchers out of naturall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) is ſorted twofoldly. The partition whereof, ſtandeth chiefely of reaſon, then of ſence: the one hath leſſe, the other more communion with the bodye. The reaſonable part in euery well gouerned bodye, hath the dominion, and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth principally. The duetye and action of the other, may not vnfitly be compared (albeit in a contrary manner) to a faythfull Corporall, who dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly attendeth the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and carefull call of his <hi>Sentenell,</hi> or to a ready and valiant ſouldiar, who executeth moſt ſpéedely the will of his commaunder. The office of the one, as of a chiefe, is to commaunde, rule, and controlle: the dutye of the other to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, and cherefully proſecute the charge to him commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. So that as to an armye encamped no greater perill can happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if the <hi>Corporall</hi> ſléepe, when the <hi>Sentenell</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, or the <hi>Souldiar</hi> diſobey, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Chiefe,</hi> or <hi>Captayne</hi> commaundeth: in lyke manner, a miſerable confuſion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but follow that minde and bodye, where right is abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the courſe of nature violated.</p>

               <p>I cannot but aſſent (except I would ſtriue agaynſt reaſon) to your good opinion. For where fanſie is plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without iudgements appoynting, where luſt taketh his pleaſure without reaſons lyking, where furye raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth without polityke direction, to conclude, where any affect is found phantaſtick: there vnlooked for miſerie ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes the minde forethinking, there ſoueraignetye lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably ſobbeth, through the ryott of indignitye.</p>

and dayly preſented before their eyes, the ſwéete and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious garland that is purchaſed by vertue, and chiefely, by Magnanimitye. There would not be then that vnſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and lothſome puffing, ſuch ſtryuing, and wreſtling would not be then for ſo vile a wretch. The complayntes of the poore would not be then ſo many, and ſo pitifull, the complayntes of the rich would not be found then ſo few and beggarly. Gentlemen of great value, ſhould not then wander as Pilgrims, in forrayne landes, ſuſpected as ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtardes, and children borne in haſt.

He had a lawe geuen him, that he ſhould exerciſe that frée will in the practiſe of vertue, that at length he might by his owne demerites, deſerue to be of the number and company of heauenly Saintes.

               <p>Your ſaying is moſt true.

               <p>This therefore was the eſtate of our firſt parent which ſhould haue bene moſt happy and bleſſed, if he had not acquaynted himſelfe with that huge and cruell mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous beaſt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath brought to all nations peſtilent infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For when the Prince of darckeneſſe (the chiefe Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of thoſe Angels as I haue declared) who through the puffe of Pride fell into the lamentable and pittifull pitt of perdition, who vnderſtood and ſaw man made of earth, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend into that place of glory fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence he fell: he through mallice waxed hoate, imagining all kinde of meanes to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow vtterly the ſtate of mankinde. Taking vpon him therefore the ſhape of a Serpent aſſaulted through guiles and fayned ſleightes, the woman our firſt parentes fellow mate, whom he thought to ſubdue with leſſe labor, for that ſhe was frayle and the féebler veſſell, he therefore inticeth her, and with ſwéete and ſugred wordes allureth her, to the eating the fruit forbidden: bearing her in hand, that as ſoone as ſhe ſhould take a taſt of that moſt pleaſaunt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſhe ſhould eftſoone be inſpired with that heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, of good and euill. The woman therefore being mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiloulſy
<pb facs="tcp:4839:13"/>
allured with the fayreneſſe of the trée, and alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed aboue meaſure with the deſire of that heauenly ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and wiſedome, was eaſily induced to drinke that cupp of deadly poyſon, offered vnto her, by that moſt ſubtle and peſtilent Serpent. Thus, the woman neglecting the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of the moſt high God, and gracious geuer of all goodneſſe, folowed the counſell of her moſt deadly ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, inuiting alſo her huſband to that woefull and bloudye banquett. <hi>This was the originall and beginning of the miſery of man. Herehence came all trouble ſome motions of minde, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by was inge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred in the fleſh all chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geable &amp; wauering deſires, herehence came all kinde of corruption, herehence ſprang all fooliſh and vayne opinions: from this roote roſe mortality, moſt bitter and greuous lamentations, ſorrowes, ſobbes, and grones, for feare of death grew from this foundation:</hi> which the ſeely and wretched minde of man incontinently felt. For this was moſt iuſtly deeréed, that he which had broken the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of his Lord, and moſt impudently and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly ſtood agaynſt his will and pleaſure, in like manner ſhould haue thoſe parts which before were obedient, rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious and contraryly diſpoſed, aſſaying moſt deſperately to inuade and ouerthrow the fortreſſe of reaſon. And whereas two thinges eſpecially belonged to man, that is to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe himſelfe in action and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templation, and therefore was indued with a reaſonable minde, that in whatſoeuer he tooke in hand, he ſhould wiſely gouerne euery affect of the minde and imploy all the power of his minde in ſearching out of heauenly wiſedome: he in both theſe partes was déepely wounded. For the minde, when the cleare light therof was extinct, wherewith it before gliſtred gloriouſly, lay now ouercaſt with darckeneſſe and obſcurity, and the whole order of life being (as it were with darcke night) o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerwhelmed, was wellnigh yut beſide his rule and ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raygnety, ſo that although in that darckeneſſe ſome glimſe of light appeared, yet could it not thereby be guyded to the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:4839:13"/>
end deſired. Then ſhamefull ſilthyneſſe ſhewed it ſelfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time vnknowen, by the ougly ſight and monſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous aſpect whereof, our firſt partes being diſmayed, ſhrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in darcke woodes, and couered thoſe partes with leaues of trees, which they felt to be moſt ſtriuing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt reaſon and vnderſtanding. Nothing was done in thoſe dayes for a great ſeaſon by due order of reaſon and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline, but all matters were executed violently whereas frantique and furious headineſſe had the vpper ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. Then Robberyes were rife, then rapes common, then inceſt not accompted of, then murthers infinite. Then thoſe, who in force and ſturdines paſt other, tooke it no offence at their pleaſure to afflict &amp; puniſh the weaker ſort. In this great darknes, in this common miſerye, in this vniuerſall woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, there appeared a man, who through his cleane and vnſpotted handes, his cleare &amp; pityfull eyes, his ſtreight and vpright minde, drewe many extremely handled, to his reuerence, loue, and honor. Whome when they noted, not onely to abſteine himſelfe from villany, but bend to Cay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues and Murtherers a ſterne and irefull countenaunce, and take commiſeration of the afflicted: then theſe wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched wormes crawled vnto him, making a ſcritch &amp; woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cry. Of whoſe ſutes and lamentable complayntes, when he had taken compaſſion, and ſought by witt and pollicie to ayde and aſſiſt, became vnto them at length, a lanterne of Juſtice, a mirrour of mildnes and courteſie.

               <p>The excellencie therefore of iuſtice, ſtands of force, and vertue: the vertue of iuſtice reſteth in the meaſure of thinges ordered, according to reaſons preſcription, which teacheth that all men ſhould beare the lyke affection to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as they would be affected of other. The force of iuſtice is to make of many, one, to vnite and knit many partes in one: which euidently may appeare, if we call to minde that in the beginning it did ſo greatly excite and ſtirre vp mens mindes, that for her loue they ſurre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dered their goods and poſſeſſions into the handes of one eſpeciall man, in whoſe amiable face this vertue did through flaſhing flames ſhewe forth her cleare light of glory.

On the other ſide there were for Cowards eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by very good lawes, bitter tauntes and reproches, moſt iuſtly appoynted. <hi>There was in olde tyme among the Macedonians a lawe ordeyned, that he who had not in fight of battaile ouercome one, ſhould in the ſight of all men be trust vp with an halter.</hi> Therefore, moſt wiſely was it thought of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> greatly honored among the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians for his deepe iudgement,</hi> that the ſecuritye and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a Commonwealth, did conſiſt in preferment, &amp; puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.

               <p>In that people, this is alſo greatly to be noted, that not onely noble men were wonderfully inflamed with the loue of glorye, but very many of the common people. And that I may, of a great and infinite number, call a fewe to memory, the two <hi>Decii</hi> by race and byrth no gentlemen, for theyr rare and ſingular fortitude, aſpired in the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth to the higheſt degrée of honor and dignity: and in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end, in theyr countryes quarrell, conſecrates themſelues as valiaunt and vowed veſſels, to glory and immortality. <hi>Lucius Marcius,</hi> euen he, which in Spayne recouered y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romaine Empyre, therefore ſhrunken and fallen downe to the ground, was borne of ſimple and poore parentage, yet through puiſſaunce obtayned in his countrey great honor &amp; a principal dignity. What ſhould I recite <hi>Marcus Porci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Cato,</hi> a man much commended for his wiſedome and pollicy? To what end ſhould I ſpeak of <hi>Marcus Marcellus</hi> who firſt gaue Haniball the ouerthrow, &amp; ſhewed playnly, that the way to ouercome, was by prowes and valiantnes. Agayne why ſhoulde I omitt Marius that worthye wight and a thowſand moe being no gentlemen borne, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding through theyr paſſing ſkill and experience in feates of Armes were aduaunced to honour, and promoted to high eſtate, leauing to poſterity fame and immortalitye. Herehence the armes and cognizaunces of honor and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe, which euen in theſe our dayes are borne, and had right worthely in eſtimation, did fetch their originall and firſt beginning. For when any man had in battayle ſhewed ſome notable poynt of a good valiaunt ſouldiar, he was by the Generall made a gentleman, &amp; had ſome badge or token therof aſſigned vnto him, wherby his bloud might
<pb facs="tcp:4839:16"/>
be ennobled, through the prayſe and glorye whereof his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring might be in like maner pricked with the deſire of fame and commendation. Therefore ſome haue in their ſcochins, Caſtles engraue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, geuing forth therby the ſtrong holdes, fortes, ſtraightes, ſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces and paſſages, that were by them in warre wonne and va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quiſhed: other ſome, ringes or bendes, or any other thing for the number of enemies which they had in ſome doubtfull and daungerous battaile ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued. Other haue in theyr ſchochins ſtarres, ſignifiyng per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe that they brought in ſome darcke and cloudy calamity, no ſmall light and comfort to the miſerable afflicted ſtate of their natiue countrye, by this it is playne that fortitude openeth the way to worſhippe, and bringeth vs moſt redy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the beholding the excéeding bright and cleare nature of true nobility. <hi>And to the end you may vndoubtedly diſcerne the true value of a man, and know aſſuredly where fortitude is, where puiſſaunce, where that high and lofty minde dwelleth: the calamities which doe equally aſſault aſwell the noble as baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, ſome with griefe, ſome with feare ſome with terror, ſome with trembling, may yelde vs a plaine and vndeceiueable marck and teſtimony. For where puiſſaunce and fortitude is, there is ingraffed a minde not to faynt for any trouble, not to diſpayre in any perrill, not to languiſh in any woe and greeuous miſery, yea if Fortune frowne, if daunger &amp; death enſue, a worthy mind will not be forgetfull. So that nothing may alike ſhew a gentle and valiant hart, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not to be va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quiſhed: which is ſeene in ſorrow, tried in trouble, proued in perſecution.</hi>

There is in vs a kinde of power, inferior to reaſon, yet her next handmayd, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we féele in vs a prones to be this or that way affected. The affection therefore that is ingendred by this faculty, is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:4839:17"/>
ſuch, that as it is moſt fitt, good and neceſſary, ſo if it wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth not the direction, and as it were the finger poynt of reaſon, it is intollerable &amp; bréedeth oft our woe and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. For by nature we waxe hoate, angry, and cholericke, naturally we loue, naturally we loth, we pitty, we deſpiſe, we feare, we frowne, we deſire, we diſdayne, we are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailouſly by kinde ſtirred vp with ioy and pleaſure. Which affections before they become actions, leaſt they ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede theyr iuſt due and proportion, and turne thereby to our annoy, are to be tempered and moderated by reaſons rule and diſcipline. This man therefore that can thus go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne, and moderate the motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the minde, hath wonne the loue of <hi>Temperaunce,</hi> and ſhall be honored of all men as one indued with a rare, and ſingular vertue. The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections therefore of the minde, as ire, loue, pleaſure, and the ſolace it ſelfe of lyfe, with many other are not (as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt men ſuppoſe) to be raced out, but rather with the light and flame of reaſon in the beſt and higheſt mindes enkindled. Lyke as in the ſea, ſuch quiet &amp; calme weather is not to be deſired, wherewith the floud may not be with the leaſt puffe of winde troubled, but rather ſuch open aire wherby the ſhipp at the ſtearne may ſulck the Seas with a mery gale and proſperous winde: euen ſo there is to be deſired in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> minde a puffe, &amp; as it were, a blowing billow to hoyſe vpp the ſayles of the minde, whereby the courſe thereof may be made more ſwift &amp; certayne.

Prudence therefore reſteth in the knowledge of ciuile gouernement: which learneth vs not onely to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne wiſely our ſelues, and families, but to rule poletik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly great Cittyes and Commonwealthes. And that you may fully vnderſtand, by what meanes this vertue is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned, it is right neceſſary, &amp; expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t you call to minde, how men liuing as Barbarians, in woods and deſolate places were brought to order, and at length perſwaded to lyue vnder one lawe embracing mutuall loue, &amp; all kinde of humanitye. Wherefore, if the ſwéetenes and excellencie of eloquence in antiquitie ſo much preuailed, that men were with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mellodious harmonye thereof, drawen from barbarouſnes, to ciuilytye: If puiſſance in the beginning repelled iniuries, and became thereby the roote of roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altye: if good and profitable lawes ſtayed moſt faſtly, men thus reclaymed and brought to the quiet and happy home of peace and reſt: I holde the onely redye and perfect ſtepp to trace out prudence, by the loue of Eloquence, by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of chiualrye, by the knowledge and ſtudye of the ciuile lawes. For theſe ſciences are right worthely reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe which are the moſt chiefe &amp; higheſt: for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they haue bene the founders of Citties, the ſafegard of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſocietye, the principall ſtay and rocke of all noble and floriſhing Commonwealthes. <hi>To be prudent in a priuate man, is right worthely commended: in a king, in a prince, and in the place of Maieſtye it geueth out ſuch comfortable bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, that thouſands and infinite numbers thereby, receaue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe: For her propertye is, to be diligent, and buſie for the weale</hi>

                  <hi>of all.</hi> They are therefore in no wiſe to be déemed prudent, which ſéeke the aduauncement of themſelues, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment of any one priuate Familye. Wherefore, if you to your expectation, and our wiſhed and laboured intent, purpoſe to behold the high and hautye hue of the Maieſtye of a king, marke and imprint déepely in your minde, what briefly inſueth. A king therefore, as it appeareth by the diſcourſe precedent, came of no ſmall beginning, deriued, and ſpringing of no other roote, then an honorable and roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all hart, garniſht, and deckt with all worthye, and noble vertues <hi>So that this king which we ſpeake of, and haue through the viewe, and conſent of many famous and worthy writers, cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to be chiefe in this our Commonwealth, is ſuch a one, whoſe Scepter iuſtice rayſed, whoſe ſoueraigntye fortitude defendeth, whoſe preheminence prudence ruleth, whoſe prerogatiue tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraunce keepeth in moſt ſafe and quiet eſtate.</hi> Which chiefe and principall vertues, reſte alwayes in perpetuall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, the motion whereof bringeth forth aboundantly braunches or rather (if you pleaſe) buddes, which cann be by no irkeſome and ſharpe aire blaſted, for that the ſapp and iuice of this trée in euery braunch and twigge thereof continually equally floriſheth, being ſubiect to no tyme and ſeaſon. <hi>Herehence mercy floweth, herehence mildenes, herehence courteſie, affabilitye, liberalitye, prouidence, loue, which maruelouſly graceth the maieſtye of a king.</hi> This is alſo to be required &amp; chiefely looked for, of a King, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what noble acte ſoeuer he take in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, whether it appertayne to ciuile gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in tyme of peace, or to martiall prowes, in tyme of warre, his clearenes and excellencye, geue moſt manifeſt notice and ſignification, that he ſetteth no ſtore by humaine thinges, but doth with moſt earneſt indeuour &amp; intention of minde, affect thoſe thinges that be heauenly, and euerlaſting.

               <p>I will moſt gladly doe my indeuour. The two limmes that chiefly and aboue other, ſtrengthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the body of <hi>Princely maieſtie, is the Iuſticer and ſouldiar.</hi> The charge of which is great, and honor acquired thereby right worthely had in eſtimation: The one executeth the will of his <hi>Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne</hi> vpon the offender at home, and in the Citty, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wreaketh the indignation of the <hi>Prince</hi> in the field, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the body of his enemy.

The one with his toung kéepeth peace, the other with the ſword reſtoreth peace in daunger, &amp; clean loſt to his former ſtate. So that whereas both ſhoot at one principall marcke (for the good and perfect ſouldiar hath two marckes and endes of his action, the one victory, wherein he winneth honor, more priuate: the other peace, wherby he returneth triumphantly to receiue of his Prince and countrey the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles due to ſo great deſart, which maketh his former honor which I before named more priuate, more publicke, more knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, more ample and glorious) yet ſith the meanes dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not a litle, whereby the iuſticer is promoted to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and the ſouldiar aduaunced to an honorable calling in
<pb facs="tcp:4839:20"/>

For what can the <hi>iuſticer</hi> haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſard in peace, where the enemy is repelled, where force is ſubdued, where fury is put to flight? his treaſure, wealth, wife and children, are by the lawes, as with a ſure and ſtrong forte) defended his name and honeſty, a number of lately richt clients (with earneſt and difficult ſuites ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) garde, his health phiſicke preſerueth. On the other ſide the ſouldiar ſo litle eſtemeth ſafety at home, content in his mate, pleaſure in his children, ſolace with his friendes, that where his fidelity to his <hi>Prince,</hi> loue to his countrey, honor of his vpright minde, ſhall be brought in queſtion, and ſtand to be tryed, he will not onely moſt willingly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe all theſe, but cherefully vow and conſecrate his luſtye limmes to tireſome labours, his body richly clad, to pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching nakedneſſe, his feeding nature, to ſtaruing hunger, his freſh and liuely lookes to lothſome languiſhing: his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowes to be ſeuered, his ioyntes to be cut in two, his bloud to be ſpilt, his carcaſe to be ſtamp to dyrt &amp; myre.

               <p>Albeit it be a matter very difficult to iudge, whether ſhould be preferred before other, ſith the vertue in a iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer and ſouldiar are not of one kinde (although they pricke at one marcke) and that it farre paſſeth the reach of either of our capacityes to waygh their priuate vertues ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, in equall ballances, leauing therefore the controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to be decided by men of déeper indgement, and ryper experience, notwithſtanding I thinke it moſt fitt the iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:4839:20"/>
not vnworthyly (if his calling and condition of life be well examined) to haue the ſecond place in this our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. For where you reaſon thus, that the ſouldiar doth haſſard more then the iuſticer, fearing no force, drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding no daunger, pricing no perrill whereby his honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble minde ſhould be more ſéene and appear (with lofty and high courage I cannot with words ſufficiently commend) yet your reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is inféebled by this, that it is agaynſt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of peace, and therefore much agaynſt the duety, order and courſe of good magiſtrates, to ſuffer (as much as in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lyeth) any ſuch iniurious action to be committed, whereby the ſtomake of the leaſt man ſhould be ſo tried and proued. The actions are not of one kinde, for that they take not the like beginning, although they haue the like end and direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Agayne a reaſon ſpringing of one ſinguler Action, to conclude in generality, a better or worſe hath ſmall, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther no force at all. Wherefore ſithe you made mention of fortitude and magnanimity as though the ſouldiar onely, and not the iuſticer did regarde and embrace ſo greate and noble a vertue, and might be condemned of daſtardly cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardiſe, I haue thought it good and expedient to cleare ſo high and eſtimable a calling, of ſo baſe &amp; foule a crime. Firſt therefore, whereas it is moſt manifeſt that the minde of the iuſticer and ſouldiar is occupyed about one thing, that is, peace and tranquility, the one to kéepe it alwayes flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, the other to reſtore it decaying and in daunger, here it would be demaunded, whither the honour of the iuſticer is not as great and nobler in preſeruing common quiet, or the worthineſſe of the ſouldiar to be more extolled in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing &amp; redéeming peace preſſed and throwen downe to the ground.

Where the the minde is ſtyrred with a deſier to be aduaunced, and to rayſe his name and bloud, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a meane to a higher degrée, there is the minde ſo vexed with diuerſitye, that at length it yeldeth to ſome great and greuous extremitye.

               <p>In this caſe I thinke it moſt expedient and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, I ſort a Souldiar firſt into his diuerſitye, or rather braunches, which knowen, you ſhall more playnely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what he is. All theſe therefore are conteyned within the name of a Souldiar. The <hi>Generall, high Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall with his Prouoſtes, Serieant generall, Serieant of a regiment, Corownell, Captayne, Liuetenent, Auncient, Serieant of a Company, Corporall, gentleman in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany or of the Rounde, Launce paſſado:</hi> theſe are ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, the other that remaine, priuate or commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Souldiars. The Profeſſion as well of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mmon, as priuate Sould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iar is honorable, which reſteth in the maintenaunce to death, of a good and rightfull cauſe: the condition no leſſe paynefull then full of perill, the quality, cleane, diligent, duetifull, delighting rather in braue furniture and glitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring armor, then in deynty dyet, womanlyke wantonnes, and vayne pleaſures. It is fitt he be not onely ſkilfull in the weapon he vſeth, but alſo in any other that his ſtrength

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement.

Finally the onely &amp; chiefe grace, that beautifieth the minde of a Souldiar, is the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt of Spoyle, and refuſall of riches. For the corrupt opinion of wealth and pleaſures, are the enemies of verue, the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements not to ſo fond, as wicked endeuors.</p>

               <p>On Sonday before Chriſtmas laſt paſt 4. hundred fifty and foure <hi>Malecontents</hi> were ſlayne by the Engliſhe nation, at <hi>Swarfe Sluce</hi> in the weſt partes of <hi>Friſeland,</hi> onely, with the loſſe of one <hi>Captayne</hi> named <hi>Elles</hi> &amp; thrée other priuate ſouldiars. The glory of which ouerthrow and victory is chiefly to be geuen to God, the honor to <hi>M. Norris</hi> and his Captaynes, the prayſe and commendation to his officers and ſouldiars. In conſideration whereof, I call to minde a prouerbe not ſo olde as true: As the king is ſo is his people: which I may moſt fitly &amp; truely apply to <hi>M. Norris</hi> now Generall of the Armye of the States in Friſela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. As the Generall is, ſo are his Captaynes Lieue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenauntes, officers and ſouldiars. For where the deſire of true honor, &amp; glory is in the Generall imprinted, there the
<pb facs="tcp:4839:30"/>
Captaynes, officers, and ſouldiars, by a naturall loue and inclination that the beſt mindes are ſtirred therewith, are much more ſet on fire and enkindeled.</p>
               <p>So that whereas this noble gentleman, hath by his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant actes, proued himſelfe to be a fountayne of fame, a welſpring of vertue, a riuer of royaltye, it cannot be, but that his people become péereleſſe, noble, and magnificent. For where the Generall féedeth his minde, with high and honorable cauſes, and ſtandes therein reſolute, there his Captaynes and Souldiars are preſt to all manner of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptes, be they neuer ſo difficult: And where ſuch Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes are preſt, there are atchiued feates more wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, then reaſonable. And to ſpeake ſomething of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and eſpecially, of the ſmall and litle troupe vnder Maiſter Norris, it is incredible to thinke and report how their vertue doubleth the worthynes of other Nations. For as their leaders, and commaunders excell in witt, prowes, and value: ſo haue they them in more loue, reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and admiration. For this may be truely ſayd of our Countrymen: that euen the rude multitude, doe loue their rulers, and ſuperiors, according to their vertues, and magnanimitye, that they ſée in them. No people in the world more faythfull, more affectionate, then are the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Nation, if they be reteyned accordingly: neither are they euercome a whitt with the helliſh furies, and brutiſh crueltyes, that doe generally poſſeſſe all other Nations in the world. For, it is naturally geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the right Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to content himſelfe with the victory, and to take pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye on the vanquiſhed. And where this vertue of commiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and mercye dwelleth, there alſo dwelleth naturally hardynes &amp; prowes. For it is an infallible rule, that where feare is, there is alſo crueltye. So that I conclude of this principle: ſith our Nation doth excell other in loue, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, courteſie, placabilitye and mercye, they alſo are to be preferred before the ſtraunger in true value, hardynes,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:4839:30"/>
courage, prowes, and magnanimitye.</p>

               <p>All of one nature, are not indued with the ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame qualitye and vertue, neither is this difference to be noted in men onely: but in beaſtes, trées, and plantes. For trées which are of one kinde, ſpread not their braunches in lyke fayrenes, euery Stead doth not his Carrier with the lyke loftynes, neither is euery Lyon of lyke ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth. In all the workes of Nature, as I haue before declared, there is to be noted a varietye of value, diſpoſition, and qualitye: ſo that according to that diuerſitye, and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nature wée ſée the oddes of labors, and ſtud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye. Some therefore according to their ſkill, and reach, embrace a ſcience, which more ſtrengtheneth, and ſtayeth the weaker partes of a Commonweale, then other: in which place, I putt the Clothyer, other worke on gold and ſiluer, other worke on Iron, other till the ground, other in this, or that ſcience, beſtow their carefull paynes: all to the profitt and commoditye of their natiue Countrye. In conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of whoſe diuers diſpoſitions, in one kinde and nature, this I iudge moſt worthy to be reported, reade, and remembred: that Nature by diſpoſing our affections, ſo diuerſly, brought to paſſe moſt prouidently, that man, who of all other creatures was ordayned to maintayne a ſocietye, ſhould be thereunto forced of neceſſitye. For the trauayle of each man thus differing, yeldeth to other that which by his owne inſtuſtrye, he could neuer attayne.</p>
