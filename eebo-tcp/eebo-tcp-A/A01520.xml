            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>You shall well vnderstand my well beloued schollers, that as God is the author of all goodnesse, so is it requisite that in all traditions and Morall preceptes we begin firste to consider of him, to regard his maiestie, and search the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne poyntes of his Godhead. The Heathen Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers (although they had not the light to vnderstand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect trueth) were yet all of them astonyed at the incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible maiesty and power of God, some of them thought the ayre to be God, some other the earth, some the infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of things, some one thing, some another, whose opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions I shall passe ouer as thinges vnméete to be much thought of, but by the way, the opinion of <hi>Plato</hi> is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy here to bee recited vnto you, who taught plainely that god was omnipotent, by whom the world was made, and al thinges therein created and brought vnto such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as they be in. <hi>Xenophon</hi> affirmed that the true God was inuisible, and that therefore we ought not enquire what or what maner of thing God is. <hi>Aristo</hi> the Stoicke, affirmed lykewyse that God was incomprehensible. To conclude, <hi>Simonides</hi> being demaunded what God was, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired one dayes respect to answer, and then being again demaunded the same question, he required two dayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spet, at the third apointment of his answere, he came &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired thrée dayes, and being demaunded wherefore he did so breake his apointments, and require alwayes further time, he aunswered, that the more déepely that he did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the matter, the more infinite he found it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore remained alwaies astonyed what to answere, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways craued further time.

                  <p>Your request is reasonable, and it shalbe by mée as readyly graunted, as it hath bene by you necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily required. Your first chapter and lesson shall then be, that in all your actions you haue an especiall eye and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to almighty God, and in that consideration I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend vnto your memory, first God himselfe, and seconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily his ministers. As touching your duties vnto God him self, although they be infinite, yet shall we sufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine them in thrée especiall poynts to be perfourmed: that is to say, <hi>Feare, Loue,</hi> &amp; <hi>Trust.</hi> And first to begin with feare, it shalbe necessary and aboue all thinges your bounden duty, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>eare God and his omnipoten power. <hi>Linus</hi> that auncient Poet wryteth, that with God all thinges are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie to be accomplished, and nothing is vnpossible. <hi>Tully</hi> in
<pb facs="tcp:6028:11"/>
his Oration <hi>Pro Roscio amerino</hi> saith, that the commodityes which wée vse, the light which we enioy, and the breath which we haue and drawe, are giuen and bestowed vppon vs by God: then if with God all thinges be possible (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Linus</hi>) he is to be feared, sithens the least part of his displeasure being prouoked, the greatest part of his will is to him right easie to accomplish: and if we haue our light, our lyfe, and all commodities of his gift (as <hi>Cicero</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth) then is hée to be feared, least with the facillity of his omnipotency he take away as fast as he gaue, or turne light into darknes, life into death, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities into dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities. I might recite you many heathen authorities, but it is most néedlesse, since y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> very word of God himself, is most plaine in this behalfe, and yet I haue here set downe these fewe, because they are not repugnant to holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Wée finde written in the xx. chapter of <hi>Exodus,</hi> that God is a Ielous God, and doth visit the sinnes of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vppon the children vnto the third and fourth genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Feare him then for he is most mightie.</hi> Againe: who shall defend me (saith the Psalmist) vntill thine anger be past? <hi>Feare God</hi> then, since against his power no defence preuay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth.

                  </p>
                  <p>And yet with this feare you must also ioyne loue, for it is not with God as it is with Princes of the worlde, which to make themselues feared do become Tyrantes, but the<note place="margin">Loue God.</note> goodnes of almighty God is such, that he desireth no lesse to be loued, then he deserueth to be feared, and though his might and power be vniuersall, and there withall his Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie great, and his displeasure soon prouoked, yet deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth he not in the distruction of mankind, but rather that a sinner should turne from his wickednes and liue. <hi>Tully</hi> in his second booke <hi>de legibus</hi> saith, that God being Lord of al things doth deserue best of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kind, bicause he b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Well then to return vnto the matter, you shall performe vnto the King thrée especial dutyes, that is to say: <hi>Honour, Obediencae,</hi> and <hi>Loue. Hypodamus</hi> in his booke of a common welth, saith that a kingdome is a thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the imitation of gods power. <hi>Diotogenes</hi> the schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of <hi>Pytagoras</hi> in his booke of gouernment, saith that a king representeth the figure of God amongst men. Lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he sayth, that as god excelleth the most perfect things of nature, so the king excelleth amongst men and worldly matters: so that he is to bee honored as the lieutenant of God here vpon earth, both because he hath power of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, and chiefly because he representeth that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly King, who is king of kinges, and aboue all Kynges to be honoured: Euen so is hee also to bee obayed in all se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer constitutions and pollitike prouisions. This obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth consequently follow hono<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

the body, for whatsoeuer he be that gyueth vnto his king that honor which to him apperteineth, will (no doubt) lykewise obay him with all humilitie. <hi>Erasmus</hi> teacheth in his <hi>Apothegmes,</hi> that obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce expelleth al seditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyneth concorde: the which may also appeare by naturall reason and common experience, neyther shall they euer become able to beare rule them selues, whiche cannot bee content to obay the aucthoritie of others. Wherfore it shal be most conuenient that you obay the King, synce his auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie is fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god, &amp; as this obedience dependeth vpon the honour wherewith ye shall reuerence the King as Gods lieutenant, so must you also ioyne therunto an vnfayned loue, for as almightye God is to be loued because hee is mercifull: so the King beeing apoynted by God muste be loued bycause he is thy pretector heere on earth. <hi>Salamon</hi> sayth, that the kings indignation is the messenger of death, whereby I would frame myne argument from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye, that hee is to be loued, least his indignation being iustly kindled, thou bee not able to beare it. Next vnto the king we are to consider the Magistrates which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted for administration of iustice, and pollityke gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: these Magistrates must also bee honoured, obeyed, &amp; loued: honored because they are y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> substituts of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> king vnto whom all honour (on earth) apperteyneth, obeyed because theyr office is appointed by the Kings aucthoritie, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued because they are the graue and expert personages, which deuise lawes and constitutions for continuaunce of peace and tranquillitie. The apostle <hi>Paule</hi> in his xiii. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Epistle to the <hi>Romaines,</hi> teacheth playnely, that Rulers beare not the sworde in vaine, saying: <hi>Let euerie soule be subiect vnto the higher powers, for there is no power but of God. Againe, the ruler (sayth he) doth not beare the sworde in vayne.</hi> Wherefore you must néedes be subiect, not onelye for feare, but also for conscience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And Sanct <hi>Peter</hi> in hys fyrst Epistle and the seconde chapiter, doth sufficientli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <hi>Submit your selfe vnto all manner ordinaunce of man for the Lordes sake, whether it bee vnto the king as hauing the preheminence, or vnto the rulers as vnto them that are sent of him for the punishment of euill dooers, but for the laude of them that do well.</hi> Whereby appeareth, that the magistrates are not onely to be feared, because they pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysh offenders, but also to be loued because they cherish the verteous: and for conclusion of this poynt, if you desire to be good men, then learne to performe duety towardes all magistrates. As <hi>Sophocles,</hi> well sayde, <hi>it becommeth a good man to haue due respect vnto all magistrates.</hi> I might nowe take your Parentes in hande, for the next pointe of your enstruction but I will first touch the duety which you owe vnto your countrye, and that is conteyned also in three especial pointes: that is to saye, in <hi>Thankefulnesse, Defence,</hi> and <hi>Proffit.</hi> And as ingratitude is the most heinous offence against God, so haue I taught you that it is the greatest faulte in humayne actions, amongst the which it sheweth it selfe no way more vntollerable, then if you shoulde hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to bee vnthankefull vnto your country. <hi>Tully</hi> in his offices sayth, that wee are not borne onely for our owne perticuler cause or profit, but parte (sayth he) our cuntrey challengeth, parte our Parentes think due vnto them, and our friendes ought lykewise to enioye some parte of our trauailes. There are dyuers Philosophers, whiche mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne in argument that all cuntryes are frée for a noble mynde, and I agrée thereunto, but yet thereby they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude not, that a noble minde by chusing a new cuntrey to enhabit, maye lawfully forgett the cuntrey wherein hee was natiue. <hi>Zopirus</hi> is condempned in all histories, for the vnthankefulnes he vsed in betraying his cuntrey. The truth of the Troyan historie accuseth <hi>Aeneas, Antenor,</hi> &amp; certeyne others, as most vnthankefull traytors to theyr cuntrey. <hi>Cillicon</hi> for betraying of <hi>Miletus, Lasthenes</hi> for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering of <hi>Oli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

for neglecting of his charge in <hi>Samos,</hi> are generally no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the names of vnthankeful and vntrustie traytors to theyr cuntreyes: so that you must alwayes remember to become thankefull to your cuntrey, and myndefull to maynteyne the honor of the same, least neglecting your dueties in that behalfe, you deserue the oprobrious names of traytors, which are odius to God and man. You muste also spare no peril or trauaile to defende the same, for your countrey challengeth not onely that you be thankfull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the soyle which hath bredde you, but furder also, that you defende the state, wherein you haue béene nourished. <hi>Tully,</hi> in his <hi>Tusculanes</hi> questions recyteth one <hi>Lascaena,</hi> who when he receiued tydings of his sounes death, whom he had sent into the warres in defence of hys countrey, answered: therefore did I beget him (quoth hee) that hée might be such an one, as woulde not doubt to dye for hys countrey.

I might trouble you with infinite stories to proue this proposition, but let these few suffice, and in your countrie haue allways especiall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specte to the elders, to whom you must also performe thrée seuerall deuties: that is, <hi>Reverence, Loue,</hi> and <hi>Defence. Lycurgus,</hi> ordeyned, that no young man should passe by an elder without reuerence fyrste doone vnto him, namelie if he were set, he rose to do reuerence vnto the elders, and if they were alone, he was bound to proffer them the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb facs="tcp:6028:19"/>
of his company. <hi>Plato,</hi> in his nynth dyalogue of lawes and constitucions doth thus propound: al men must grant (sayth he) that age is much to be preferred before youth, aswell in the sight of God, as also in the sight of men, which will lyue orderly: for it is abhominable (sayth he) that an olde man shoulde geue place vnto an young man, and the Gods them selues do hate it, since youth ought with paciente mynde to beare euen the strypes of their el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. You shal also loue them, because of them you may learne good preceptes, and of them you may be bolde to aske councell: for as <hi>Euripides,</hi> in his tragedy called <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissae,</hi> doth teache, prudence will not be gotten with fewe dayes seeking for, and the apostles teach vs our deuty dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly in that behalf, who ordeyned amongst them elders in euery congregation, to decyde all matters in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie, of whome they were resolued of all doubtes in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. It shal also becom you to defend the elders from al vyolence and outrage, since it is a thing as comly and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable to defende the weake, as it is glorious and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant to ouercome the mightie: whereof I myght re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite many famous examples out of the Romain histories, but I will partlie include the same in the dueties which you owe vnto your Parentes, which are also, <hi>Honor, Loue,</hi> and <hi>Reliefe.</hi> And of the first parte, although I might bring in sundry worthy examples, yet because the case is of it self familiar, I wil be briefe, and vse no other persuation then the expresse commaundement of God, who biddeth you to honor your Father and Mother, that your<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dayes maye bée long in the land which the Lord your god hath giuen you.

in bearing of you, you muste alwaies meditate in your minde, fyrst the cares which they haue had to preserue you from bodily perils in the cradell, from daunger of damp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by Godly education, from néede and hunger by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministring things necessarie, and from vtter destruction by vigillant foresight &amp; Godly care: all these with infinit other things considered, you shall finde your selues boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by manyfolde occasions to loue your Parentes, and to be assistant vnto them in the necessities of their age. For well sayd that Poet, which affirmed that children were tenderly swadled in their cradels, to the ende they mighte susteyne their aged Parentes and supplie their wantes. Meruelous is the nature of the Storke, which féedeth the damme in age, of whom it selfe receiued nouriture béeing young in the neast. <hi>Tully</hi> in his booke of the answers of soth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayers sayth, that nature in the beginning hath made an accord betwéene vs and our Parents, so that it were dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable not to cherish them.

                  <p>Surely my harte did not greately like him at the first sight, but since thinges done cannot be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, I lyke well that you should (according to your owne deuise) prouide in time before they wade déeper in such enterprises, and to speake mine opinion, you may doe wel to send them vnto some Uniuersity, before they haue fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acquaintance or haunt in such company, for whether
<pb facs="tcp:6028:32"/>
it be loue, or lust that hath infected them, there can be no presenter remedy then to absent them from the thinges which they desire, and therewithall I promise you (not to flatter) they are already very sufficiently able for the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersity, and the en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>And me thinkes we might better doe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme the Markgraue. Who vppon such meanes as we shall make, may banish the harlot with her traine out of the City, and may also punish the parasite for so entysing the younge men.</p>

Wherefore myne aduice shoud be that you send them to some Uniuersitie, and as neare as you can forsée to place them with such a Lutor as may alwaies haue an eye to their exercises, and may haue especiall care how they shall bestow their vacant tymes.
