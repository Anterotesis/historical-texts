            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHereas on the ninth inſtant there was a Letter, from the Lord <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> came on board the Ship <hi>James,</hi> directed to the Vice-Admirall, in which he deſired, that he, and thoſe concerned, might give the Freedome of their thoughts touching a Government for the Common-Wealth: In Anſwer to the which was Retorned by the Vice-Admiral, and all the Commanders preſent, That being burthened in Spirit, at the ſence of the unhappy breaches and diſtractions amongſt the good people in the Nation; it was their humble apprehenſion, that the hopefulleſt wayes and means to make up the breaches and diviſions, was a happy compoſure betwixt the Parliament and Army, and that the Parliament might return to their Truſts, which when the Lord pleaſe to Grant, they could heartily joyn with any in Petitioning, that all words ſpoken, or things done by any perſon whatſoever, concerned in the difference betwixt the Parliament and Army, ſince the 13th of <hi>October</hi> 1659. might be for ever obliterated.</p>
            <p>Now foraſmuch as the ſame burthen lyes upon our Spirits ſtill, in the Apprehenſion of the ſad Conſequences that are like to enſue; for that We do not hear of any Compoſure, but that the Breach growes wider, thereby eminently threatning the loſſe and utter Ruine of the Cauſe and Intereſt of Chriſt and His People, which for ſo many years hath been ſo conteſted for, and coſt much Blood and Treaſure, both by Sea and Land. We apprehending ſtill that there's no other Viſible means under Heaven to heal the Breaches, and ſecure the N<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And we do further Declare, (as in the preſence of the Lord) that we have no Aym nor Ends to Advance particular Intereſts, but the Intereſt of Chriſt, and the Good and Weal of all the People of God; in their Rights, Civil, and Religious; and of our poor ſuffering Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in General.
