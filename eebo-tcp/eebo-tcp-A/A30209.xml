            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THese are the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and are therefore in an especial manner to be heeded; besides, the subject matter of the words, is the most weighty, to wit, how we should attain salvation, and therefore also to be heeded.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43328:4"/>
good, and, that called for such an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer that might profit the people al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so: This question also, well pleased Jesus Christ, and therefore he prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and giveth such an answer, as was without the least retort, or shew of distaste, such an answer I say, as carried in it the most full resolve to the question it self, and help to the persons questioning; <hi>And he said unto them, strive to enter in,</hi> &amp;c. The words are an answer, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction also.</p>
            <p>1. An answer, and that in the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative, <hi>the gate is strait many that seek will not be able,</hi> therefore but few shall be saved.</p>
            <p>2. The answer, is an instruction also, <hi>strive to enter in,</hi> &amp;c. good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, and instruction; pray God help me, and my Reader, and all that love their own salvation to take it.</p>
            <p>My manner of handling the words will be, first by way of <hi>Explication,</hi> and then by way of <hi>Observation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By way of <hi>Explication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:43328:4"/>1. The words are to be considered, with reference to their <hi>general scope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. And then with reference to their several phrases.</p>
            <p>1. The general <hi>scope</hi> of the text is to be considered, and that is that great thing <hi>Salvation;</hi> for these words do immediatly look at, point to, and give directions about <hi>salvation. Are there few that be saved? strive to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in at the strait gate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words, I say, are to direct us, not only to talk of, or to wish for, but to understand how we shall, &amp; to seek that we may be effectualy saved; and therefore of the greatest impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. To be saved! what, is like being saved? to be saved from sin, from hell, from the wrath of God, from eternal damnation, what is like it? To be made an heir of God! of his grace! of his kingdome and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal glory! what is like it? and yet all this is included in this word, <hi>saved,</hi> and in the answer to that question, <hi>are there few that be saved?</hi> indeed this
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43328:5"/>
word, <hi>saved,</hi> is but of little use in the world, <hi>save</hi> to them that are hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily afraid of <hi>damning.</hi> This word lies in the Bible, as excellent salves lie in some mens houses, thrust into a hole, and not thought on for many moneths, because the houshold peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have no wounds nor sores: In time of sickness, what so set by, as the Doctors glasses, and gally-pots full of his excellent things; but when the person is grown well, the rest is thrown to the dunghil. Oh when men are sick of sin, and afraid of damning, what a text is that, where this word <hi>saved</hi> is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound? yea, what a word of worth and goodness and blessedness is it to him that lies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually upon the wrath of a guilty conscience? <hi>but the whole need not the phisitian:</hi> He therefore, and he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, knows what <hi>saved</hi> means, that knows, what <hi>hell</hi> and <hi>death</hi> and <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> means: <hi>what shall I do to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</hi> is the language of the trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling sinner; <hi>Lord save me,</hi> is the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43328:5"/>
language of the sinking sinner, and none admire the glory that is in that word <hi>saved,</hi> but such as see without being saved, all things in heaven and earth are emptyness to them, they also that believe themselves pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged in all the blessedness that are wrapped up in that word, blesse and admire God that hath saved them: wherefore, since the thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended both in the question and the answer is no less then the salvation of the soul, I beseech you to give the more earnest heed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 21.</p>
            <p>But to come to the particular phrases in the words, and to handle them orderly in the words I finde four things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. An intimation of the kingdom of heaven.</item>
               <item>2. A description of the entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</item>

            <p>Behold therefore what a great thing the Lord Jesus hath included by this little word, <hi>in,</hi> in this word is wrapt up an whole heaven, and eternal life: even as there is also by other little words in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of truth; as where he saith, <hi>knock, and it shall be opened unto you,</hi> and the elect have obtained <hi>it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This should teach us, not only to reade but to attend in reading, not only to read, but to lift up our hearts to God in reading, for if we be not heedful, if he give us not light and understanding; we may easily pass o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver without any great regard, such a word as may have a glorious king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and eternal salvation in the bowels of it: yea somtimes, as here, a whole heaven is intimated, where it is not at all expressed. The Apostles of old, did use to fetch great things
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43328:7"/>
out of the Scriptures, even out of the very order and timeing of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things contained therein, see <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 9, 10, 11. <hi>Gala.</hi> 3. 16, 17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 13. but,</p>
            <p>Secondly, As we have here an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation of the kingdom of heaven, so we have a description of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into it, and that by a double similitude.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. It is called a <hi>gate.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>A strait gate: strive to enter in at the strait gate.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>1. It is set forth by the similitude of a <hi>gate.</hi> A <hi>gate,</hi> you know, is of a double use, it is to <hi>open</hi> and <hi>shut,</hi> and so consequently, to let in, or to keep out; and to do both these <hi>at the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;</hi> as he said, <hi>let not the gates of</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem <hi>be opened till the sun be hot;</hi> and again, <hi>I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath:</hi> (<hi>Neh.</hi> 7. 3. <hi>chap.</hi> 13. 19, 20.) And so you finde of this gate of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, when the five wise virgins came,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43328:8"/>
the gates were open, but <hi>afterward came the other virgins, and the door was shut, Matt.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>So then, the entrance into heaven, is called <hi>a gate,</hi> to shew, there is a time when there <hi>may be</hi> entrance, and there will come a time <hi>when there shall be none;</hi> and indeed this is a chief truth contained in the text: <hi>strive to enter in at the strait gate, for many I say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I reade in the Scriptures of two gates or doors, through which they that go to heaven must enter.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>There is the door of faith,</hi> the door which the grace of God hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to the gentiles, this door is J<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, as also himself doth testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, saying, <hi>I am the door,</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>Acts.</hi> 14. 27. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 9.) By this door men enter into Gods favour, and mercy, and finde forgiveness through faith in his blood, and live in hope of eternal life; and therefore himself also hath said, <hi>I am the door, by me if any man</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:43328:8"/>
               <hi>enter in, he shall be saved,</hi> that is, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to mercy and inherit eternal life: but</p>
            <p>2. There is another door, or gate; (for that which is called in the text, <hi>a gate,</hi> is twice in the next verse, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>a door</hi>): there is, I say another gate, and that is the passage into the very heaven it self; the entrance into the celestial mansion-house, and that is the <hi>gate</hi> mentioned in the text, and the door mentioned twice in the verse that follows. And thus <hi>Jacob</hi> called it, when he said <hi>Bethel was the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven,</hi> that is, the entrance, for he saw the entrance into heaven, <hi>one end of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs ladder stands in Bethel, Gods house, and the other end reacheth up to the gate of heaven. Gen.</hi> 28. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>Jacobs</hi> ladder was the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of Christ, which ladder was not the gate of heaven, but the way from the Church to that gate which he saw above at the top of the ladder: <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 12. and <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 51.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:43328:9"/>But again that the gate in the text, is the gate, or entrance into heaven, consider,</p>
            <p>1. It is that gate that letteth men into, or shuteth men out of that place or kingdom where <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> is, which place is that paradice where Christ promised the thief, that he should be that day, that he asked to be with him in his kingdom: it is that place into which <hi>Paul</hi> said, he was caught, when he heard words unlawful or impossible for a man to utter, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>0. <hi>chap.</hi> 23. 24. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> But is not Christ the gate or entrance into this heavenly place?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> He is he without whom no man can get thither, because by <hi>his merits</hi> men obtain that world, and also because he (as the father) is the doner and disposer of that kingdom to whom he will: further, this place is called his house, and himself the master of it (<hi>when once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:43328:9"/>
               <hi>the door</hi> (<hi>ver.</hi> 25.) But we use to say, that the master of the house, is not the door: men enter into heaven then, by him, not as he is the gate or door, or entrance into the celestial mansion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house, but as he is the giver and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposer of that kingdom to them who he shall count worthy, because he hath obtained it for them.</p>
            <p>2. That this gate is the very passage into heaven, consider the text hath special reference to the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when Christ will have laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side his mediatory office, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he exercised for the bringing to the faith his own elect; and will then act, not as one that justifies the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, but as one that judgeth sinners; he will now be risen up from the throne of grace, and shut up the door against all the impenitent, and will be set upon the throne of judgment, from thence to proceed with ungodly sinners.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But Christ bids <hi>strive, strive n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w to enter in at the strait gate,</hi> but
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43328:10"/>
if that <hi>gate</hi> be as you say, the <hi>gate,</hi> or entrance into heaven, then it should seem, that we should not strive till the day of judgment, for we shall not come at that gate till then.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Christ, by this exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>strive,</hi> &amp;c. doth not at all admit of, or countenance delayes, or that a man should neglect his own salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but putteth poor creatures up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on preparing for the judgment, and counselleth them <hi>now</hi> to get those things that will then give them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into glory. This exhortation, is much like these, <hi>be ye therefore rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy also, for at such an hour as you think not, the son of man cometh: and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage, and the door was shut. Matt.</hi> 24. 44. <hi>Chap.</hi> 25. 10.</p>
            <p>So that when he saith, <hi>strive to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in,</hi> it is as if he should say, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed are they that shall be admitted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother day to enter into the kingdom of heaven, but they that shall be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted worthy of so unspeakable a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43328:10"/>
must be well prepared, and fitted for it before-hand: now the time to be fitted, is not the day of judgment, but the day of grace; not <hi>then,</hi> but <hi>now:</hi> therefore <hi>strive now</hi> for those things, that will <hi>then</hi> give you entrance into the heavenly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: but,</p>
            <p>Secondly, As it is called <hi>a gate,</hi> so it is called a <hi>strait gate; strive to enter in at the strait gate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The straightness of this gate, is not to be understood carnally, but misti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally: you are not to understand it, as if the entrance into heaven was some little pinching wicket, no, the straightness of this gate is quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing. This gate is wide enough, for all them that are the truly graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and sincere lovers of Jesus Christ, but <hi>so strait,</hi> as that not one of the other can by any means enter in: <hi>open to me the gates of righteousness, I will go into them, and I will praise the Lord, this gate of the Lord into which the righteous shall enter, Psal.</hi> 118. 19, 20.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43328:11"/>
by this word therefore Christ Jesus hath shewed unto us that without due qualifications there is no possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of entring into heaven; the straight gate will keep all others out: when Christ spake this parable he had doubtless his eye upon some pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage or passages of the old testament, with which the Jews were well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted. I will mention two and so go on.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The place by which God turned</hi> Adam <hi>and his wife out of paradise;</hi> pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly our Lord might have his eye upon that, for though that was wide enough for them to come <hi>out</hi> at, yet it was to strait for them to go <hi>in</hi> at, but what should be the reason of that? why they had sinned and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God set at the east of that gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, <hi>cherubins and a flaming sword, turning every way, to keep the way of the tree of life: Gen.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, 24. These Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubins and this flaming sword, they made the entrance too <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               </gap>r it for them to enter in: souls, there are Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43328:11"/>
and a flaming sword at the gates of heaven to keep the way of the tree of life, therefore none but them that are duely fitted for heaven can enter in at this strait gate, the flaming sword will keep all others out. <hi>Know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God, be not deceived, neither fornicatours, nor Idolaters, nor adulterers, nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>2. Perhaps our Lord might have his eye upon the gates of the temple, when he spoke this word unto the people, for though the gates of the temple were six cubits wide, yet they were so strait, that none that were unclean in any thing might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in thereat, <hi>Ezek</hi> 40 48. because there were placed at them gates, por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters whose office was to look that none but those that had right to enter, might go in thither: and so it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43328:12"/>
               <hi>Jehojadah set porters at the gates of the house of the Lord, that none that were unclean in any thing might enter in.</hi> 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 23. 19. Souls, God hath porters at the gates of his temple, at the gate of heaven; porters, I say, placed there by God, to look that none that are unclean in any thing may come in thither. In at the gate <hi>of the Church,</hi> none may enter <hi>now,</hi> that are open profane and scandalous to religion; no, though they pleade they are beloved of God; <hi>What hath my beloved to do in mine house</hi> (saith the Lord,) <hi>seeing she hath wrought leudness with many, Jer.</hi> 11. 15.</p>
            <p>I say, I am very apt to believe, that our Lord Jesus Christ had his thoughts upon these two texts, when he said, <hi>the gate is strait,</hi> and that which confirms me the more in the thing, is this, a little below the text he saith, <hi>there shall be weeping, and gnashing of teeth, when you shall see</hi> Abraham, <hi>and</hi> Isaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>and all the prophets in the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:43328:12"/>
               <hi>and you your selves thrust out, ver.</hi> 28. <hi>thrust out,</hi> which signifieth a violent act, resisting with striving; those that would (though unqualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) enter: the porters of the temple were, for this very thing, to wear arms if need were, and to be men of courage and strength, lest the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified or unprepared should by some means enter in.</p>
            <p>We reade in the book of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi> of the <hi>holy citie,</hi> and that it had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve Angels, but what did they do there? why amongst the rest of their service, this was one thing, <hi>that there might in no wise enter in, any thing that desileth, or worketh abomination, or that maketh a lie: Revel.</hi> 21. 12. 21.</p>
            <p>But more particularly to shew what it is, that maketh this gate so strait: there are three things that make it strait.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. There is sin.</item>
               <item>2. There is the word of the law.</item>
               <item>3. There are the Angels of God.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:43328:13"/>First, there is sin, the sin of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, and the sin of the professor.</p>
            <p>1. The sin of the profane, but this needs not be inlarged upon, because it is concluded upon, at all hands, where there is the common belief of the being of God, and the judgment to come, that the <hi>wicked shall be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into hell, and all the nations that forget God: Psal.</hi> 9 17.</p>
            <p>2. But there is the sin of professors, or take it rather thus, there is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession that will stand with an unsan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified heart and life, the sin of such will overpoise the salvation of their souls, the sin-end being the heaviest end of the scale: I say, that being the heaviest end which hath sin in it; they tilt over; and so are, notwithstanding their glorious profession, drowned in perdition and destruction: <hi>for none such hath any inheritance in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Christ and of God, therefore let no man deceive you with vain words, for because of these things, comes the wrath of God upon the children of</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:43328:13"/>
               <hi>disobedience;</hi> neither will a profession be able to excuse them, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 3. 4. 5. 6. The gate will be too strait for such as these to enter in thereat. A man may partake of salvation in part, but not of salvation in whole: God saved the children of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but overthrew them in the wilderness: <hi>I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards destroyed them that believed not: so we see,</hi> (that notwithstanding their beginning) <hi>they could not enter in, because of unbelief, Jud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> 5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 19.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>There is the word of the Law,</hi> and <hi>that will make the gate strait</hi> also: none must go in thereat but those that can go in by the leave of the law, for though no man be or can be, justifyed by the works of the law, yet unlesse the righteousness and holyness by which they attempt to enter into this kingdom, be justified
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43328:14"/>
by the law, 'tis in vain once to think of entring in at this <hi>strait gate:</hi> now the law justifieth not, but upon the account of Christs righteousness; if therefore thou be not indeed found in that righteousnes, thou wilt finde the law, lie just in the passage into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to keep thee out; every mans work must be tried by fire, that it may be manifest of what sort it is. There are two errors in the world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the law, one is, when men think to enter in <hi>at the strait gate by the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of the law,</hi> the other is, when men think, <hi>they may enter into heaven, without the leave of the law;</hi> both these, I say, are errors: for, as by the works of the law, <hi>no flesh shall be justified,</hi> so without the consent of the law, <hi>no flesh shall be saved, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth shall passe away, before one jot, or title of the law shall fail, till all be fulfilled: he</hi> therefore must be <hi>damned,</hi> that <hi>cannot</hi> be saved by the consent of the law, and indeed this law is the flaming sword that turneth
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:43328:14"/>
every way, yea, that lieth to this day, in the way, to heaven, for a barr to all unbelievers and unsancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied professors, for it is taken out of the way for the truly gracious <hi>only;</hi> it will be found as a roaring lion to devour all others: because of the law therefore the gate will be found too strait for the unsanctified to enter in; when the Apostle had told the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> that <hi>the unrighteous should not inherit the kingdom of God,</hi> and, that <hi>such were some of them,</hi> he adds, <hi>but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified, in the name of the Lord Jesus, &amp; by the spirit of our God.</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 9. 10. 11. closely concluding, that had they not been washed, and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, and justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, the law, for their transgressions, would have kept them out, it would have made the gate too strait for them to enter in.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There are also the Angels of God, <hi>and by reason of them the gate is strait.</hi> The Lord Jesus, calleth the

            <p>I come now to the Exhortation, which is <hi>to strive to enter in; strive to enter in at the strait gate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These words are fitly added, for since the gate is strait, it follows, <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> they that will enter in must strive.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Strive,</hi> this word <hi>strive,</hi> supposeth that great idleness is natural to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, they think to get to heaven by lying as it were on their elbows. 2. It also suggesteth, that many will be the difficulties that professors will meet with before they get to heaven. 3. It also concludeth, that only the labouring Christian, man or woman will get in thither.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Strive,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Three questions I will propound upon the word, an answer to which
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43328:16"/>
may give us light into the meaning of it.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Quest.</hi> What doth this word, <hi>strive,</hi> import?</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Quest.</hi> How should we strive?</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Quest.</hi> Why should we strive?</p>
            <p>First, What doth this word <hi>strive,</hi> import?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> When he saith, <hi>strive,</hi> It is as much as to say, bend your selves to the work with all your might: <hi>Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do; do it with all thy might, for there is no work nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the grave, whither thou goest. Eccles.</hi> 9. 10. thus <hi>Sampson</hi> did, when he set himself to destroy the Philistins, <hi>he bowed himself with all his might, Judg.</hi> 16. 30. Thus <hi>David</hi> did also when he made provision for the building and beautifying of the temple of God, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 29. 2. And thus must thou do if ever thou entrest into heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly,</hi> When he saith <hi>strive,</hi> he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth for the <hi>minde</hi> and the <hi>will,</hi> that they should be on his side, and on the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43328:16"/>
side of the things of his kingdome; <hi>for none strive indeed,</hi> but such as have given the son of God their heart, of which the minde and will are a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part, for saving conversion lieth more in the turning of the minde and will to Christ, and to the Love of his heavenly things, then in all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Judgment: and this the Apostle confirmeth when he saith, <hi>stand fast in one spirit, with one minde, striving</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 27.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly,</hi> And more particularly, this word <hi>strive,</hi> is expressed by several other terms, as,</p>
            <p>1. It is expressed by that word, <hi>so run that you may obtain,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 24. 25.</p>
            <p>2. It is expressed by that word, <hi>fight the good fight of faith, lay hold of eternal life,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 12.</p>
            <p>3. It is expressed by that word, <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour not for the meat that perisheth, but for that meat that endureth to everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life, Joh.</hi> 6. 27.</p>
            <p>4. It is expressed by that word, <hi>we</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:43328:17"/>
               <hi>wrestle with principalities and powers, and the rulers of the darkness of this world, Ephes.</hi> 6. 12. Therefore when he saith, <hi>strive,</hi> it is as much as to say, <hi>run</hi> for heaven, <hi>fight</hi> for heaven, <hi>labour</hi> for heaven, <hi>wrestle</hi> for heaven, or you are like to go without it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the second question, is <hi>how should we strive?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The answer in general is, thou must strive lawfully; <hi>and if a man also strive for the mastery, yet is he not crowned, except be strive lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 25.</p>
            <p>But you will say, <hi>what is it to strive lawfully?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Answer 1. to strive against the things which are abhored by the Lord Jesus, yea, to resist to the spilling of your blood, <hi>striving against sin, Heb.</hi> 12. 4. to have all those things that are comdemned by the word, yea, though they be thine own right hand, right eye, or right foot, in abomination; and to seek by all godly means the utter suppressing of them, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9. 43, 45, 47.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:43328:17"/>
               <hi>2ly,</hi> To strive lawfully is to strive for those things that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in the word; <hi>But thou O man of God fly,</hi> the world, <hi>and follow after, that is strive for righteousness, godly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, faith, love, patience, meekness, fight the good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ight of faith, lay hold on eternal life,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 11. 12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly,</hi> He that striveth lawfully must be therefore very temperate in all the good and lawful things of this life. <hi>And every one that striveth for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, is temperate in all things: now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 25. most professors give leave to the world, and vanity of their hearts, to close with them and to hang about their necks, and make their striving to stand rather in an out-cry of words, then a hearty labour against the lusts, and love of the world, and their own corruptions, but this kind of striving is but a beating of the air, and will come to just nothing at last, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9, 26.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:43328:18"/>
               <hi>4ly,</hi> He that striveth lawfully, must take God and Christ along with him to the work, otherwise he will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be undone: <hi>whereunto,</hi> said <hi>Paul, I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily, Colo.</hi> 1. 29. and for the right performing of this, he must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve these following particulars.</p>
            <p>1. He must take heed, that he doth not strive about things, or words to no profit, for God will not <hi>then</hi> be with him: <hi>of these things,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>put them in remembrance; charging them before the Lord, that they strive not about words to no profit, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the subverting of the hearers,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 14. But alas! how many professors in our days are guilty of this transgression, whose religion stands chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fly, if not only, in a few unprofitable questions, and vain ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glings, about words and things to no profit, but to the destruction of the hearers, <hi>Tit.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 9.</p>
            <p>2. He must take heed, that whilst
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43328:18"/>
he strives against one sin, he does not harbour and shelter another, or that whilst he cries out against other mens sins, he does not countenance his own.</p>
            <p>3. In the striving, strive to believe, strive <hi>for</hi> the saith of the Gospel, for the more we believe the Gospel, and the realitie of the things of the world to come, with the more stomack and courage shall we labour to possess the blessedness, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 27. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. <hi>let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. As we should strive for, and by faith, so we should strive by prayer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 30. by fervent and effectual praiers; O the swarms of our praier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less professors! what do they think of themselves! surely the gate of heaven was heretofore as wide as in these our dayes, but what striving by prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was there then among Christians for the thing that gives admittance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this kingdom, over there is in these latter days?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:43328:19"/>5. We should also strive by morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying our members that are upon the earth: <hi>I therefore so run, said</hi> Paul, <hi>so fight I, not as one that beats the air, but I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection, left that by any means when I have preached the Gospel to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers I my self should be a castaway.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 27. But all this is spoken principally to professors, so I would be understood.</p>
            <p>I come now to the third question, namely <hi>but why should we strive?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Answer 1. Because the thing for which you are here exhorted to strive, it is worth the striving for: it is for no less then for a whole heaven, and an eternity of felicity there; how will men that have before them, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle honour, a little profit, a little plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, <hi>strive?</hi> I say again, how will they <hi>strive</hi> for <hi>this? now they do it for a corruptible crown, but we an incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> Methinks this word <hi>heaven,</hi> and this eternal life, what is there again either in heaven or earth like them to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43328:19"/>
provoke a man to strive?</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Strive,</hi> because otherwise the devil, and hell, will assuredly have thee. <hi>He goes about like a roaring Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, seeking who he may devover:</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. these fallen Angels, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways watchful, diligent, unwearied, they are also mighty, subtle, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, seeking nothing more then the damnation of thy soul; O thou that art like the heartless dove, <hi>strive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Strive</hi> because every lust strives and wars against thy soul; <hi>the flesh lusteth against the spirit; dearly belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, I beseech you,</hi> said <hi>Peter, as stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul: Gal.</hi> 5. 17. 'tis a rare thing to see, or finde out a Christian, that indeed can bridle his lusts, but no strange thing to see such professors that are not only bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, but sadled too, yea, and ridden from lust to sin, from one vanitie to another, by the very devil himself, and the corruptions of their hearts.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Strive,</hi> because thou hast a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43328:20"/>
whole world against thee, the world hateth thee, if thou bee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t a christian: the men of the world hate thee, the things of the world are snares for thee, even thy bed and table, thy wife and husband, yea, thy most lawful enjoyments have that in them that will certainly sink thy soul to hell, if thou doest not <hi>strive</hi> against the snares that are in them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 9.</p>
            <p>The world will seek to keep thee out of heaven, with mocks, flouts, taunts, threatnings, goals, gibbits, hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, burnings, and a thousand deaths, <hi>therfore strive</hi> Again, if it cannot over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thee with these, it will flatter, promise, allure, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, intreat, and use a thousand tricks on this hand to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy thee; and observe, many that have been stout against the threats of the world, have yet been overcome with the bewitching flatteries of the same: there ever was enmity betwixt the devil and the Church, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his seed and her seed too; <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:43328:20"/>
and his Angels, and the dragon and his angels: these make war con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. There hath been great desires and endeavors among men to reconcile these two in one, to wit, the seed of the serpent, and the seed of the woman, but it could never be yet accomplished: the world says, they will never come over to us, and we again say, by Gods grace, we will never come o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to them, but the business has not ended in words, both they and we have also added our endeavours to make each other submit, but endeavours have proved ineffectual too: They for their part have devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed all manner of cruel torments to make us submit, as flaying with the sword, stoning, sawing asunder, flames, wilde beasts, banishments, hunger, and a thousand miseryes; we again on the other side have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured by praiers, and tears, by patience, and long-suffering, by gentleness, and love, by found do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43328:21"/>
and faithful witness-bearing against their enormities, to bring them over to us, but yet the enmitie remains; so that they must conquer us, or we must conquer them, one side must be overcome, <hi>but the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of our war fare are not carnal but mighty through God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. <hi>Strive,</hi> because there is nothing of Christianity got by idleness, idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness cloaths a man with rags, and the vineyard of the slothful is grown o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with nettles, <hi>Pro.</hi> 23. 21. <hi>chap.</hi> 24. 30. 31. 32. profession that is not attended with spiritual labour cannot bring the soul to heaven, the fathers before us were not slothful in busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but fervent in spirit, serving the Lord. <hi>Therefore be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises; Rom.</hi> 12. 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Strive to enter in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Methinks the words at the first reading, do intimate to us, that the Christian in all that ever he does in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43328:21"/>
this world, should carefully heed and regard his soul, I say, in all that ever he does; many are for their souls by fits and starts, but a Christian in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in all his doings, and designes which he contriveh and manageth in this world, should have a special eye to his own future and everlasting good, in all his labours he should strive to enter in. <hi>Wisdom</hi> (Christ) <hi>is the principal thing: therefore get wisdom, and in all thy gettings get un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi> Pro. 4. 7. Get nothing, if thou canst not get Christ and grace, and further hopes of heaven, in that getting; get nothing with a bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, with the hazzard of thy peace with God, and that in getting it, thou weakenest thy graces which God hath given thee, for this is <hi>not to strive to enter in:</hi> adde grace to grace, both by religious and worldly du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for <hi>so an entrance shall be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred unto you abundantly into the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting kingdom of our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Jesus Christ.</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 1. 8. 9. 10.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43328:22"/>
11. religious duties are not only the striving times, he that thinks so, <hi>it out:</hi> thou maist help thy faith, and thy hope in the godly managment of thy calling, and maist get further foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in eternal life, by studying the glory of God, in all thy worldly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. I am speaking now to Christians that are justified freely by grace, and am incouraging, or rather counselling of them, to <hi>strive to enter in,</hi> for there is an entring in by faith and good conscience <hi>now,</hi> as well as an entring in, in body and soul <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after;</hi> and I must, add, that the more common it is to thy soul to enter in now by faith, the more stedfast hope shalt thou have of entring in hereafter in body and soul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rive to enter in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By these words also the Lord Jesus giveth sharp rebuke to those profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors that have not eternal glory, but other temporal things in their eye, by all the bustle that they make in the world about religion: some there be,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:43328:22"/>
what a stir they make, what a noise and clamour, with their notions and forms, and yet perhaps all is but for the loaves; because they have eaten of the loaves and are filled <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 26. these strive indeed to enter, but it is not into heaven; they finde, religion hath a good trade at the end of it, or they finde, that it is the way to credit, repute, preferment, and the like, and therefore they strive to enter into these; but these have not the strait gate in their eye, nor yet in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves have they love to their poor, and perishing souls: wherefore this exhortation nippeth such, by predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of their damnation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Strive to enter in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These words also sharply rebuke them who content themselves as the Angel of the <hi>Church of Sardis</hi> did, to wit, <hi>to have a name to live, and be dead,</hi> Revel. 3. 1. or as they of the <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceans,</hi> who took their religion upon trust, and was content, <hi>with a poor, wretched, lukewarm profession:</hi> For
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:43328:23"/>
such as these do altogether unlike to the Exhortatian in the text; that says, <hi>strive;</hi> and they sit and sleep, that says <hi>strive to enter in,</hi> and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themselves with a profession that is never like to bring them thither.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Strive to enter in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, these words put us upon proving the truth of onr graces, <hi>now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> I say, they put us upon the proof of the truth of them <hi>now:</hi> for if the <hi>strait gate</hi> be the gate of heaven, and yet we are to strive to enter into it <hi>now;</hi> even while we live, and before we come thither, then, doubtless Christ means by this exhortation, that we should use all lawful means to prove our graces in this world whether they will stand in the judgment or no: <hi>strive to enter in,</hi> get those graces now that will prove true graces then, and therefore try them you have, and if upon tryall they prove not right, cast them away, and cry for better, lest they cast thee away, when better are not to be had: <hi>Buy of me gold tried in</hi>

               <hi>the fire,</hi> mark that, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 20. Buy of me faith and grace that will stand in the judgment, strive for that faith, buy of me that grace, <hi>and also white raiment that thou mayest be cloathed, that the shame of thy wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness doth not appear, and annoint thine eyes with eye-salve that thou maiest see:</hi> minde you this advice, this is right sttiving to enter in.</p>

            <p>The reason why Christ addeth these words, <hi>to enter in,</hi> is obvious; to

wit, because there is no true &amp; lasting happiness on this side heaven; I say none that is both true and lasting, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

teeth; yea without are all the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, sorrows, and plagues that an infinite God can in justice and power inflict upon an evil and wicked gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: <hi>strive therefore to enter in at the strait gate. Revel.</hi> 22. 15. <hi>Matt.</hi> 25. 41. <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. 9. <hi>Isai.</hi> 65. 13. 14. <hi>Matt.</hi> 22. 13. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 18. 19. 20.</p>

            </p>
            <p>We are now come to the motive which our Lord urges to inforce his exhortation: he told us <hi>before,</hi> that the gate was strait, he also <hi>exhorted</hi> us to <hi>strive</hi> to enter <hi>in</hi> thereat, or to get those things <hi>now</hi> that will further our entrance <hi>then,</hi> and to set our selves against those things that will hinder our entring in.</p>
            <p>In this motive there are five things to be minded.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That there will be a disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to some at the day of judgment, <hi>they will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:43328:26"/>2. That not a few, <hi>but many,</hi> will meet with this disappointment, <hi>for [many] will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. This doctrin of the miscariadge of <hi>many,</hi> then, it standeth upon the validity of the word of Christ; <hi>for many [I say] will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. Professors shall make a great heap, among the many that shall fall short of heaven, <hi>for many I say [un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you] will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>5. Where grace and striving are wanting <hi>now, seeking,</hi> and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to enter in, will be unprofitable <hi>then, for many, I say unto you will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>But I will proceed in my former method, to wit, to open the words unto you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For many,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>If he had said, <hi>for [some] will fall short,</hi> it had been a sentence to be minded: If he had said, <hi>for some that</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:43328:26"/>
               <hi>seek<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will fall short,</hi> it had been very awakening, but when he saith, <hi>many, many will fall short,</hi> yea many among professors will fall short, this is not only awakning, but dreadful.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For many,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I finde this word <hi>many,</hi> variously applyed in the Scripture.</p>
            <p>1. Sometimes it intendeth the open profane, the wicked, and ungodly world, as where Christ saith, <hi>wide is the gate, and broad is the way that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to destruction, and many there be that go in thereat; Matt.</hi> 7. 13. I say by the many <hi>here,</hi> he intends those chiefly, that go on in the broad way of sin, and prophanness, bearing the tokens of their damnation in their foreheads, those whose dayly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise proclaims, that their <hi>feet go down to death, and their steps take hold of hell. Job,</hi> 21. 29. 30. <hi>Isa.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>Pro.</hi> 55.</p>
            <p>2. Sometimes this word, <hi>many,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth those that cleave to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God deceitfully, and in hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisy; or as <hi>Daniel</hi> hath it, <hi>many shall</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:43328:27"/>
               <hi>cleave unto the Church with flatteries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dan.</hi> 11. 34. The word <hi>many,</hi> in this text, includeth all those who feign themselves better then they are in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; it includeth I say those that have religion, <hi>only,</hi> for an holy-day saint to set them out at certain times and when they come among sutable company.</p>
            <p>3. Sometimes this word <hi>many,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth them that apo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e from Christ, such as for a while believe and in time of temptation fall away, as <hi>John</hi> saith of some of Christs disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>from that time</hi> many <hi>of his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples went back, and walked no more with him. Joh.</hi> 6. 66.</p>
            <p>4. Sometimes this word <hi>many,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tendeth them that make a great noyse, and do many great things in the Church, and yet want saving grace, <hi>many,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>will say unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and in thy name cast out devils, and in thy name done many wonderful works:</hi> mark,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:43328:27"/>
there will be <hi>many</hi> of these.</p>
            <p>5. Sometimes this word <hi>many</hi> intendeth those poor ignorant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded souls that are ledd away with every winde of doctrine: those who are caught with the cunning and crafty deceiver, who lieth in wait to beguile unstable souls. <hi>And many shall follow their pernicious ways, by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of,</hi>

               <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
            <p>6. Sometimes this word <hi>many</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth all the world, good and bad. <hi>And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life, and some to everlasting sha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ly, Sometimes this word <hi>many</hi> intendeth the <hi>good</hi> only, even them that shall be saved, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>chap.</hi> 2. 34.</p>
            <p>Since then that the word is so va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously applied, let us enquire how it must be taken in the text, and.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:43328:28"/>1. It must not be applied to the <hi>sincerely godly,</hi> for they shall never perish, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 27. 28.</p>
            <p>2. It cannot be applied to <hi>all the world,</hi> for then no flesh should be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>3. Neither is it to be applied to the open profane only, for then the hypocrite is by it excluded.</p>
            <p>4. But by the <hi>many</hi> in the text our Lord intendeth in special the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor, the professor I say, how high so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he seems to be now, that shall be found without saving grace in the day of Judgment.</p>
            <p>Now that the professor, <hi>is in special intended in this text,</hi> consider; so soon as the Lord had said, <hi>many will seek to enter in, and shall not be able,</hi> he poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, as with his finger, at the <hi>many</hi> that then he in special intendeth, to wit, them among whom he had taught; them <hi>that had eat and drunken in his presence; them that had prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied, and cast out devils in his name, and in his name done many wonderful</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:43328:28"/>
               <hi>works. Luk.</hi> 13. 26. <hi>Matt.</hi> 7. 22. These are the <hi>many</hi> intended by the Lord in this text, though others are also included under the sentence of damnation by his word in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For many,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Matthew</hi> saith concerning this strait gate, <hi>That there are but few that finde it:</hi> but it seems the cast-aways in my text, did sinde it, for you reade that they knocked at it, and cried, <hi>Lord open unto us:</hi> so then, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may seem to be this, <hi>many of the few that finde it, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I finde at the day of Judgment, some will be crying to the rocks to cover them, and some at the gates of heaven for entrance: suppose that those that cry to the rocks to cover them, are they whose conscience will not suffer them, once to look God in the face because they are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en under present guilt, and the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fears of the wrath of the lamb.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:43328:29"/>
               <hi>Revel.</hi> 6. 16. And that those that stand crying at the gate of heaven, are those whose confidence holds out to the last, even those whose boldness will enable them to contend even with Jesus Christ for entrance. Them, I say, that will have, profession, ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of devils, and many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful works to pleade: of this sort are the <hi>many</hi> in my text; <hi>for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For many,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Could we compare the professors of the times with the everlasting word of God, this doctrine would more easily appear to the children of men. How few among the many, yea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the many swarms of professors have heart to make conscience of walking before God, in this world, and to study his glory among the children of men: How few, I say, have his name lie nearer their hearts, then their own carnal concerns, nay, do not many make his word,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:43328:29"/>
and his name, and his ways a stalking-horse, to their own worldly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages. God calls for faith, good conscience, moderation, self-denial, humility, heavenly-mindedness, love to Saints, to enemies: and for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in heart, in word, and life to his will, but where is it? <hi>Mar.</hi> 11. 22. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. <hi>Philip.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>Matt.</hi> 10. 37, 38, 39. <hi>Colo.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, <hi>Mich.</hi> 6. 8. <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 17. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 21. <hi>Matt.</hi> 5. 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>These latter words carry in them a double argument to prove the truth asserted before.

            </p>
            <p>It is common with a professing people, when they hear a smart and thundring Sermon, to say, now has the preacher paid off the drunkard, the swearer, the lier, the covetous, and adulterer; forgetting that these sins may be committed in a spiritual and mistical way. There is spiritual drunkenness, spiritual adultery, and a man may be a lier <hi>that calls God his father when he is not, or that calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a christian and is not.</hi> Wherefore

perhaps all these thunders and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings in this terrible Sermon, may more concern thee then thou art a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of, <hi>I say unto you:</hi> unto you professors may be the application of all this thunder, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>chap.</hi> 3 9.</p>

            <p>[I say] <hi>unto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prophets used not to speak af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner, nor yet the holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles; for thus to speak is to press things to be received upon their own authority. They used to say, <hi>thus saith the Lord, or</hi> Paul, <hi>or</hi> Peter <hi>an Apostle, or a servant of God.</hi> But now we are dealing with the words of the son of God, it is <hi>he</hi> that hath said it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we fin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This consideration carrieth great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakning in it, but into such a fast sleep are many now adays fallen, that nothing will awaken them but that shril and terrible cry, <hi>behold the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom comes, go ye out to meet him.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>There are two things upon which this assertion may be grounded.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>There is in the world a thing like grace that is not.</hi>

            <p>Secondly, as there is a <hi>thing</hi> like grace which is not, so there is a <hi>sin</hi> called the <hi>sin against the holy Ghost,</hi> from which there is no redemption, and this sin doth more ordinarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal professors.</p>
            <p>1. There is a sin called the <hi>sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the holy Ghost,</hi> from which there is no redemption; this is evident both from <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But whosoever speaketh against the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>

            <p>These therefore are the persons that are the prey for this sin: this sin <hi>feedeth upon professors,</hi> and they that are such do very often fall into the mouth of this eater.

Now they will see what a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom it is, what glory there is in it, and now they shall also see the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse which they shall have that shall then be counted worthy to enter in: the reason why this kingdom is so little regarded, it is because it is not seen, the glory of it is hid from the eyes of the world: <hi>their eye hath not seen, nor their ear heard,</hi> &amp;c. I, but then they shall hear and see too, and when this comes to passe, then even then he that now most seldom thinks thereof, <hi>will seek to enter in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. They will now see what hell is, and what damnation in hell is, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

Now they will see what the meaning of such words as these are, hell-fire, everlasting fire, devouring fire, fire that never shall be quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: now they will see what for ever, means: what eternity means: now they will see what this word means, <hi>the bottomless pit:</hi> now they will hear roaring of sinners in this place, howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that, some crying to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to fall upon them, and others to the rocks to cover them; now they will see blessedness is no where but within.</p>

            <p>5. <hi>They will seek to enter in</hi> by plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding excuses, where they cannot e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade conviction. The flothful servant

went this way to work, when he was called to account for not improving his Lords mony. <hi>Lord,</hi> says he, <hi>I knew thou wast an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sowed, and gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where thou hast not strewed, and I was a fraid,</hi> &amp;c.

There are but few will be able to say these <hi>last words</hi> at the day of judgment; the most of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors are for imbezzeling, mis pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and slothing away their time, their talents, their opportunities to do good in; but, I say, if he that can make so good an exeuse as to say, <hi>lo, there thou hast what is thine:</hi> I say if

such an one shall be called <hi>a wicked and slothful servant,</hi> if such an one shall be put to shame at the day of judgment, yea if such an one, shall, notwithstanding this care to save his Lords mony, <hi>be cast as unprofitable into utter darkness, where shall be weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and gnashing of teeth,</hi> what will they do that have neither took care to lay out, nor care to keep what was committed to their trust?</p>
            <p>6. They will seek to enter in by pleading, that ignorance was the ground of their miscarrying in the things wherein they offended; wherefore when Christ charges them with want of love to him, and with want of those fruits that should prove their love to be true, as, <hi>that they did not seed him, did not give him drink, did not take him in, did not cloth him, visit him, come unto him, and the like:</hi> they readyly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, <hi>Lord, when saw we the an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred, or at hirst, or a strunger, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, or sick, or in prison, and did not</hi>

God forbid that we should have been such sinners, but Lord, give an instance; when was it, or where? true, there was a company of poor sorry people in the world very inconsiderable, set by with no body, but for thy self we professed thee, we loved thee, and hadst thou been with us in the world, wouldest thou have worn gold, wouldest thou have eaten the sweetest of the world, we would have provided it for thee; and therefore, <hi>Lord, Lord open to us.</hi> But will this plea do? no, then shall he answer them, <hi>in asmuch as you did it not to one of the least of these my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ye did it not to me.</hi> This plea then though grounded upon igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which is one of the strangest pleas for neglect of duty, would not give them admittance into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. <hi>These shall go away into everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

            <p>2. They will not only make a stop at the gate; but there <hi>they will knock and call,</hi> this also argueth them wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to enter: they <hi>will begin to stand without and to knock at the gate saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</hi> This word, <hi>Lord,</hi> being doubled, shews the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency of their desires: Lord, Lord, <hi>open unto us.</hi> The devils are coming; Lord, Lord, the pit opens her mouth upon us: Lord, Lord there is nothing but but hell and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

left us, if Lord, Lord thou hast not mercy upon <hi>us; Lord, Lord open to us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Their last argument for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance is their tears, when groundless considence, pleading of vertues, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses and ignorance, will not do; when standing at the gate, knowing and calling <hi>Lord Lord, open to us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> will not do, then they betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to their tears: tears are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the most powerful arguments, but they are nothing worth here: <hi>Esau</hi> also <hi>sought it carefully, with tears,</hi> but it helped him nothing at all, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 15. 16. <hi>There shall be weeping, and gnashing of teeth,</hi> for the gate is shut for ever, mercy is gone for ever, Christ hath rejected them for ever: all their pleas, excuses, and tears, will not make them able to enter into this kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in and shall not be able.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come now to the latter part of the words which closely shews us the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:43328:40"/>
reason of the rejection of these many that must be damned, <hi>they will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An hypocrite, a false professor may go a great way, they may pass tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the first and second watch, to wit, may be approved of Christians and Churches, <hi>but what will they do when they come at this iron gate that leadeth into the city?</hi> there the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of iniquity will fall, be cast down, and shall not be able to rise.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And shall not be able.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The time, as I have already hinted, which my Text respecteth, it is the day of judgement, a day when all masks and vizzards shall be taken off from all faces: It is a day wherein <hi>God will bring to light the hidden things of darknesse, and will make manifest the counsels of the heart,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 5. It is also the day of his wrath, the day in which he will pay vengeance, even a recompence to his adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:43328:40"/>At this day those things that now these <hi>many</hi> count sound and good, will then shake like a quagmire, even all their naked knowledge, their feigned faith, pretended love, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious shews of gravity in the face, their holy-day words and specious carriages will stand them in little stead: I call them holy day ones, for I perceive that some professors do with religion, just as people do with their best apparrel, hang it against the wall all the week, and put them o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> on Sundays: for as some scarce ever put on a Sute, but when they go to a Fair or a Market, so little house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion will do with some; they save religion till they go to a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; or till they meet with a godly chapman: O poor religion! O poor professor, what wilt thou do at this day, at the day of thy trial &amp; judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? cover thy self thou canst not, go for a Christian thou canst not, stand against the Judge thou canst not; what wilt thou do? <hi>The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:43328:41"/>
               <hi>shall not stand in judgement, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And shall not be able.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ability here intended, is not that which standeth in carnal power or fleshly subtilty, but in the truth and simplicity of those things, for the sake of which, God giveth the kingdom of heaven to his people.</p>
            <p>There are five things, <hi>for the want of which,</hi> this people will not be able to enter.</p>
            <p>First, this kingdom belongs to the <hi>elect,</hi> to those for whom it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared from the foundation of the world, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25. hence Christ saith, when he comes, <hi>he will send forth his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to another, Matt.</hi> 24. and hence he saith again, <hi>I will bring forth a seed out of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and out of</hi> Judah, <hi>an inheritor of my mountains, and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants</hi>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:43328:41"/>
               <hi>shall dwell there; they shall deceive, if it were possible, the very elect, but the elect hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded,</hi> Rom. 11. 7.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They will not be able to enter, because they will want the <hi>birth right;</hi> the kingdom of heaven is for the <hi>heirs,</hi> and if children then <hi>heirs,</hi> if born again then heirs: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is said expresly, <hi>except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God;</hi> by this one word, down goes all carnal priviledge of being born of flesh, and bloud, and of the will of man, canst thou produce the <hi>birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,</hi> but art thou sure thou canst? for it will little profit thee to think of the blessed kingdom of heaven, if thou wantest a <hi>birthright</hi> to give thee inheritance there? <hi>Esau,</hi> did dispise his birth-right, saying, <hi>what good will this birth-right do me?</hi> and there are many in the world of his mind to this day: tush (say they,) they talk of being born again, what good shall a man get by that? they say, no going
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:43328:42"/>
to heaven without being born again, but God is merciful, Christ died for sinners, and we will turn when we can tend it, and doubt not but all will be well at last. But I will answer thee, thou childe of <hi>Esau,</hi> that the birth-right and blessing go together, miss of one, and thou shalt never have the other; <hi>Esau</hi> sound this true, for having first despised the birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, when he would afterwards have inherited the blessing he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, for he found no place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance though he sought it careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with tears; <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14, 15. 16.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they shall not be able to enter in who have not believed with the faith of Gods operation, the faith that is most holy, even the faith of Gods elect: <hi>He that believeth on the son of God hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>verlasting life, he that believeth not the son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him. Joh.</hi> 3. But now, this faith is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of electing love, and of a new
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:43328:42"/>
birth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 11, 12. therefore all the professors that have not that faith which floweth from being born of God, will seek to enter in and shall not be able.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, they shall not be able to enter in, that have not Gospel-holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; holyness that is the effect of faith is that which admits into the presence of God, and into his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom too. <hi>Blessed and holy are they that have part in the first resurrection, on such the second death</hi> (which is hell and eternal damnation <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. 14.) <hi>hath no power,</hi> Revel. 20. 6. Blessed and holy, with the holiness that flows from faith which is in Christ, for to these the inheritance belongs. <hi>That they may receive forgivenes of sins and inheritance among them that are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by faith</hi> (said Christ) <hi>which is in me. Acts.</hi> 26. 18. this holyness which is the natural effect of faith in the son of God, Christ Jesus the Lord, will at this day of judgment, distinguish from all other shews of holiness, and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:43328:43"/>
sanctitie be they what they will, and will admit the soul that hath this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness into his kingdom, when the rest will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>They shall not be able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in,</hi> that do not persevere in this blessed faith and holiness, not that they that have them indeed, can final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall away, and everlastingly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, but it hath pleased Jesus Christ to bid them that have the right, to hold fast that they have, to endure to the end, and then tells them they shall be saved: though 'tis as true, that none is of power to keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but God worketh together with his children, and <hi>they are kept by the power of God through faith unto salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is also laid up in heaven for them:</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The foolish shall not stand in thy sight, thou h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>est the workers of iniquity.</hi> The foolish are the unholy ones, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have saith nor holiness, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance in godliness, and yet lay
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:43328:43"/>
claim to the kingdom of heaven: but <hi>better is a little with righteousness, then great revenues without right: Psal.</hi> 55. <hi>Pro.</hi> 16. 8. what is it for me to claim a house, or a farm without right; or to say, all this is mine, but have nothing to shew for it: this is but like the revenues of the foolish: his estate lieth in his conceit; <hi>he hath nothing by birth-right, and law,</hi> and therefore shall not be able to inherit the possession: <hi>for many I say unto you will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you see, that the <hi>non</hi> elect, shall not be able to enter, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e that is not born again, shall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to enter, that he that hath not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith, with holiness and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nce flowing therefrom, shall not be able to enter: wherefore consider of what I have said.</p>
            <p>I come now to give you some Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations from the words, and they may be three.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>When men have put in all the</hi>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:43328:44"/>
               <hi>claim they can for heaven, but few will have it for their inheritance; for many I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Great therefore will be the disappointment that many will meet with at the day of judgement; for many will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Going to heaven therefore will be no trivial businesse, salvation is not got by a dream, they that would then have that kingdom must now strive lawfully to enter: for many I say unto you will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall speak chiefly, and yet but briefly to the first of these Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to wit,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That when men have put in all the claim they can to the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but few will have it for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance:</hi> The Observation standeth of two parts.</p>
            <p>First, that the time is coming when every man will put in whatever claim
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:43328:44"/>
they can to the kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there will be but few of them that put in claim thereto that shall enjoy it for their inheritance.</p>
            <p>I shall speak but a word or two to the first part of the Observation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I have prevented my enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereon by my explication up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the words; but you finde in the 25. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> that all they on the left hand of the Judge, did put in all the claim they could for this blessed kingdome of heaven: If you shall take them on the left hand, as most do, for all the sinners that shall be damned, then that compleatly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the first part of the Observation, for it is expresly said, <hi>then shall they,</hi> (all of them jointly, and every one apart) also answer him saying, <hi>Lord, when saw we thee thus and thus, and did not minister unto thee, Matt.</hi> 25. 44. I could here bring you in the plea of the slothful servant, the cry of the foolish virgins; I could also here
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:43328:45"/>
inlarge upon that passage <hi>Lord, Lord, have we not eat and drunk in thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and thou hast taught in our streets;</hi> but these things are handled already, in the handling of which, this first part of the Observation is proved; wherefore without more words, I will God assisting by his grace, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to the second part therof, to wit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There will be but few of them that put in cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, more particularly, I shall prove but few of them that professe have been saved.</p>
            <p>First, in the old world, when it was most populous, even in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> we reade but of eight per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that were saved out of it; well therefore might <hi>Peter</hi> call them <hi>but few,</hi> but how few? why but <hi>eight souls; wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There were therefore but eight persons that escaped the wrath of God, in the day that the sloud came upon the earth, the rest were ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; there was also a world of them, and they are to this day in the prison of hell. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 11. 6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 19. 20.</p>
            <p>Nay I must correct my pen, there were but seven of the eight that were good, for <hi>Ham</hi> though he scaped the Judgment of the water, yet the curse of God overtook him to his damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Secondly, when the world began again to be replenished, and people began to multiply therein: how few even in all ages do we reade of, that were saved from the damnation of the world.</p>

            <p>Fourthly, there were but few in the days of David; <hi>help Lord</hi> says he, <hi>for the godly man ceaseth, for the faithful fail from among the children of men. Psal.</hi> 12. 1.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, In <hi>Isaia's</hi> time the saved were come to such a few, that he po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively says, but that there were a very small number left, God had made them like <hi>Sodom,</hi> and they had been like unto <hi>Jomorah, Isa.</hi> 1. 8, 9.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, It was cryed unto them in the time of <hi>Ieremiah, that they should run to and fro through the streets of</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>and see, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can finde a man, if there be any that executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth, and I will pardon it, Ier.</hi> 5. 1.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, God shewed his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:43328:47"/>
               <hi>Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>kiel</hi> how few there would be saved in his day, by the vision of a <hi>few hairs,</hi> saved out of the midest of a <hi>few hairs;</hi> for the saved were a few saved out of a few. <hi>Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>k.</hi> 5. 3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, you finde in the time of the Prophet <hi>Micha</hi> how the godly complain, that as to <hi>number</hi> they then were, <hi>so few,</hi> that he compares them to those that are left behinde when they had gathered the summer-fruit, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 1.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, when Christ was come, how did he confirm this truth, <hi>that but few of them that put in claim for heaven will have it for their inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> But the common people could not hear it, and therefore upon a time when he did but a little hint at this truth, the people, even all in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue where he preached it, <hi>were filled with wrath, rose up, thrust him out of the City, and led him unto the brow of the hill (whereon their city was built) that they might cast him down headlong, Luke</hi> 4. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:43328:48"/>Tenthly, <hi>John,</hi> who was after Christ, saith, that the whole world lies in wickedness, that all the world wondred after the beast, and that power was given to the beast, over all kindreds, tongues and nations; power to do what? why to cause all, both great and small, rich and poor, bond and free, to receive his mark, and to be branded for him: <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 3, 8, 16.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, should we come to observation and experience, the shew of the countenance, of the bulk of men, doth witness against them, <hi>they deciare their sin like</hi> Sodom, <hi>they hide it not, Isa.</hi> 3. 9. where is the man that maketh the almighty God his delight, and that designeth his glory in the world; do not even almost all, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue this world, their lusts and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures? and so, consequently, <hi>say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, depart from us, for we desire, not the knowledg of thy ways,</hi> or what's the Almighty that we should serve him? it's in vain to serve God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:43328:48"/>So that without doubt, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear a truth in the day of God, <hi>that but few of them, that shall put in their claim to heaven, will have it for their inheritance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I pass this head, I will shew you to what the saved are compared in the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>First, they are compared to an handful, <hi>there shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Psal.</hi> 27. 16. this corn is nothing else but them that shall be saved, <hi>Matt.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>chap.</hi> 13. 30.</p>
            <p>But mark, there shall be an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; what's an handful when compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the whole heap, or what's an handful out of the rest of the world?</p>
            <p>Secondly, As they are compared to an handful, so they are compared to <hi>a lillie among the thorns, Song,</hi> 2. 2. which is rare, and not so commonly seen. <hi>As the lillie among thorns,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>so is my beloved among the daughters.</hi> By <hi>thorns</hi> we understand
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:43328:49"/>
the worst and best of men, even all that are destitute of the grace of God, <hi>for the best of them is as a bryer, and the most upright of them as a thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedge, Mich.</hi> 7. 4. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 6. 2. I know that she may be called a <hi>lillie amongst thorns</hi> also, because she meets with the pricks of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>chap.</hi> 29. 24. 3. she may also be thus termed, to shew the disparitie that is betwixt hypocrites and the Church, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8 14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. But this is not all, the saved are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a <hi>lillie among thorns,</hi> to shew you, that they are but few in the world; to shew you, that they are few and rare; for as Christ compares her to a <hi>lillie among thorns,</hi> so she compares him to an <hi>apple-tree among the tres of the wood,</hi> which is rare, and scarce, not common.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they that are saved, are called but <hi>one</hi> of many, for though there be <hi>threescore queens, and four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score concubines, and virgins without number, yet my love,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>is</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:43328:49"/>
               <hi>but</hi> one, <hi>my undesiled is but</hi> one, <hi>Song.</hi> 6. 8. 9. according to that of <hi>Jeremiah, I will take you, one of a city. Ier.</hi> 3. That saying of <hi>Paul</hi> is much like this, <hi>know you not, that they which run in a race run all, but</hi> one <hi>receiveth the prize,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 24. but <hi>one,</hi> that is, few of many, few of them that run, for he is not here, comparing them that run, with them that sit still, but with them that run, some run and lose, some run and win; they that run and win, are few in comparison of them that run and lose: <hi>They that run in a race run all, but</hi> one <hi>receives the prise:</hi> let there then be threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number, <hi>yet the saved are but few.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, they that are the saved, are compared to the <hi>gleaning after the vintage is in: wo is me,</hi> said the Church, <hi>for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruit, as the grape gleanings after the vintage is in, Mich.</hi> 7. 1. The gleanings! what's the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:43328:50"/>
gleanings to the whole crop? and yet you here see, <hi>to the gleanings</hi> are the saved compared; 'tis the devil and sin that carry away the cart-loads, while Christ and his ministers come after a gleaning: <hi>But the gleaning of the grapes of</hi> Ephraim <hi>are better then the vintage of</hi> Abiezer, <hi>Jud.</hi> 8. Them that Christ and his ministers glean up and binde up in the bundle of life, are better then the loads that go the other way: you know it is often the cry of the poor in harvest, <hi>poor glean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, poor gleaning:</hi> And the rainisters of the Gospel, they also cry, <hi>Lord who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? Isa.</hi> 53 1.</p>
            <p>When the prophet speaks of the saved under this metaphor of glean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, how doth he amplify the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? <hi>Gleaning grapes shall be left,</hi> says he, <hi>two or three berries in the top of the upper most bough, four or five, in the outmost fruitful branches thereof, saith the Lord. Isa.</hi> 17. 6. Thus you see
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:43328:50"/>
what gleaning is left in the vineyard, after the vintage is in, two or three here, four or five there. Alas! they that shall be saved, when the devil and hell have had their due, they will be but as the gleaning, they will be but few, they that go to hell, go thither in clusters, but the saved go not so to heaven, <hi>Matt.</hi> 13. 30. <hi>Mich.</hi> 7. wherefore when the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet speaketh of the saved, he saith, <hi>there is no cluster,</hi> but when he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the damned, he saith, they are <hi>gathered by clusters, Revel.</hi> 14. 18. 19. O sinners, but few will be saved. O professors, but few will be saved!</p>
            <p>Fifthly, they that shall be saved, are compared <hi>to jewels; And they shall be mine, saith the Lord, in the day that I make up my jewels. Malachi,</hi> 3. 13. Jewels, you know, are rare things, things that are not found in every house: Jewels will lie in little room, being few and small; though lumber takes up much; In almost e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very house, you may find brass, and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:43328:51"/>
iron, and lead; and in every place you may finde hypocritical profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, but the saved are not these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon things: they are Gods peculiar treasure, <hi>Psal.</hi> 35. 4. wherefore <hi>Paul</hi> distinguisheth betwixt the lumber, and the treasure in the house; there <hi>is,</hi> saith he, <hi>in a great house, not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood, and of earth, and some to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and some to dishonour.</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 20 here is a word for wooden and earthy professors, the jewels and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure are vessels to honor, they of <hi>wood</hi> &amp; <hi>earth</hi> are vessels of dishonour, that is, vessels for destruction. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 21.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, they that shall be saved are compared to a <hi>remnant; except the Lord had left in us a very small remnant, we should have been as</hi> Sodom, <hi>and should have been like unto</hi> Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah: <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 9. A remnant, a small remnant, a very small remnant: O how doth the holy Ghost word it, and all to shew you, how few shall be saved: every one knows, what a
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:43328:51"/>
remnant is, but this is a <hi>small</hi> rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, a <hi>very,</hi> small remnant. So again, <hi>sing with gladness for</hi> Jacob, <hi>and shout among the chief of the nations, publish ye, praise ye, and say, O Lord, save thy people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the remnant of</hi> Israel; <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 7. What shall I say, the saved are often in Scripture called, <hi>a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r.</hi> 9. 8. 14. <hi>Isa.</hi> 10. 20 21, 22. <hi>chap.</hi> 11. 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16. <hi>Ier.</hi> 23. 3. <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. 32. But what's a remnant, to the whole piece: what's a remnant of people to the whole kingdom, or what's a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of wheat to the whole harvest.</p>
            <p>Eightly, the saved are compared to the tithe, or tenth part, wherefore when God sendeth the prophet to make the hearts of the people fat, their ears dull, and to shut their eyes: The prophet asketh, <hi>how long!</hi> to which God answereth, <hi>until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses with ut man, and the land be utterly desolute, and the Lord have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved man far away, and there be a great forsaking in the middest of the</hi>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:43328:52"/>
               <hi>land: but yet,</hi> (as God saith in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, <hi>I will not make a full end,</hi>) <hi>in it shall be a tenth, so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof; Isae.</hi> 6. 10. 11. 12. 13. but whats a tenth: whats one in ten? and yet so speaks the holy Ghost when he speaks of the <hi>holy seed,</hi> of those that was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served from the Judgment; and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it, the fatning, and blinding of the rest, it was to their everlasting destruction, and so both Christ and <hi>Paul</hi> expounds it often in the new Testament. <hi>Matt.</hi> 13. 14. 15. <hi>Mar.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 40. <hi>Acts.</hi> 28. 26. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 8. So that those that are reserved from them that perish, will be very few, one in ten. <hi>A tenth shall return, so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall not add more generals at this time, I pray God that the world be not offended at these: but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, <hi>but few of them that shall put in their claim for heaven will have it for their inheritance;</hi> which will
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:43328:52"/>
yet further appear in the reading of that which follows.</p>
            <p>Secondly, therefore I come more particularly to shew you, that <hi>but few will be saved,</hi> I say, but <hi>few of professors themselves will be saved,</hi> for that is the truth that the text doth more directly look at and defend. Give me therefore thy hand (good reader) and let us soberly walk through the rest of what shall be said, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let us compare as we go each particular with the holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>First, 'tis said, <hi>The daughter of</hi> Zion <hi>is left as a cottage in a vinyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged citie Isa.</hi> 18. The vineyard was the Church of <hi>Israel, Isa.</hi> 5. 1. the cottage in that vinyard, was the daughter of <hi>Zion,</hi> or the truly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious amongst or in that Church: a cottage: God had but a cottage there, but a little habitation in the Church, a very few that were truly gracious amongst that great multitude that professed; and had it not been for
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:43328:53"/>
these, for this cottage, the rest had been ruined as <hi>Sodom: Except the Lord of hosts had left in</hi> us, <hi>in the Church, a very few, they had been as</hi> Sodom: <hi>v.</hi> 9. wherefore among the multitude of them that shall be damned, professors will make a considerable party.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>for though</hi> thy <hi>people</hi> Israel, <hi>be as the sand of the sea, a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant shall return, a remnant shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Isa.</hi> 10. 22. <hi>Ro.</hi> 9. 27. for though <hi>thy</hi> people <hi>Israel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> whom thou brought'st out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to whom thou hast gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Church-constitution, holy laws, holy ordinances, holy prophets, and holy covenants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>thy</hi> people, by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration from all people, and <hi>thy</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by profession: though this <hi>thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved: wherefore among the multitude of them that shall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, professors will make a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable party.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Reprobate silver shall men call them because the Lord hath rejected them; Jer.</hi> 6. 30. the people here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:43328:53"/>
consideration, are called in <hi>verse</hi> 27. <hi>Gods people,</hi> his people by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession. <hi>I have set thee for a tower and a fortress among my people, that thou maiest know and try their way,</hi> what follows? <hi>They are all grievous revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, walking with standers, reprobate silver, the Lord hath rejected them.</hi> In <hi>chapter</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>ver.</hi> 29. they are called also the generation of his wrath: <hi>for the Lord hath rejected, and forsaken the generation of his wrath.</hi> This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I gather out of these holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; that with reference to professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Church-constitution, a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may be called the people of God, but with reference to the event and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal conclusion that God will make with some of them, they may be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the generation of his wrath.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, In the 5. of <hi>Isa.</hi> you read again of the <hi>vinyard of God,</hi> and that it was planted on a very fruitful hill, planted with the choicest vines, had a wall, a tower, a wine-press belonging to it, and all things that
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:43328:54"/>
could put it into right order and good government, as a Church, but this vinyard of the Lord of hosts brought forth wild grapes, fruits unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her constitution and government, wherefore the Lord takes from her his hedge and wall, and lets her be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>roden down: reade Christs expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon it in <hi>Matt.</hi> 2. <hi>and</hi> 33. &amp;c. look to it professors, these are the words of the text, <hi>for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Son of man, said God to the Prophet, the house of</hi> Israel <hi>is to me become dross, all they are brass and tin, and iron and lead, in the midest of the furnace, they are the dross of silver: Ezek.</hi> 22. 18. God had silver there, some silver, but it was but little, the bulk of that people was but the dross of the Church, though they were the members of it, but what doth he mean by the dross? why he looked upon them as no better notwithstanding their Church-membership, then the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:43328:54"/>
rabble of the world, that is, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to their latter end, for to be called dross, it is to be put among the rest of the sinners of the world in the judgment of God, though at present they abide in his house: <hi>Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross, therefore I love thy testimonies, Psal.</hi> 119. 119.</p>
            <p>God saith of his saved ones, <hi>he hath chosen them in the furnace of affliction.</hi> The refiner, when he putteth his sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver into his furnace, he puts lead in also among it; now this lead being ordered as he knows how, works up the dross from the silver, which dross still as it riseth, he putteth by, or taketh away with an instrument; and thus deals God with his Church, there is silver in his Church, I, and there is also dross; now the dross are the hypocrites, and graceless ones that are got into the Church, and these will God discover and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards put away as dross. So that it will without doubt prove a truth of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:43328:55"/>
God, that many of their professors that shall put in claim for heaven, will not have it for their inheritance.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, It is said of Christ, <hi>his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>an is in his hand, and he will through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purge his floor, and will gather his wheat into his garner, but will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire. Mat.</hi> 3. 12.</p>
            <p>1. The floor, is the Church of God. (<hi>O my threshing and the corn of my floor,</hi>) said God by the prophet, <hi>Isa.</hi> 21. 10. to his people,</p>
            <p>2. The wheat are those good ones in his Church that shall be undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly saved, therefore he saith, <hi>gather my wheat into my garner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The chaff groweth upon the same stalk, and ear, and so is in the same visible body with the wheat, but there is not substance in it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in time, they must be severed one from the other, the wheat must be gathered into the garner, which is heaven: and the chaff, or professors, that want true grace, must be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:43328:55"/>
into hell, that they may be <hi>burned up with unquenchable fire:</hi> therefore let professors look to it.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Christ Jesus casts away two of the three grounds that are said to receive <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e word, <hi>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Eighthly, The parable of <hi>the unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable servant,</hi> the parable of the <hi>man without a wedding garment,</hi> and the parable of <hi>the unsavory salt,</hi> do each of them ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

dreadful things happen to them.

By the vine there, I understand Christ, Christ as head; by the branches I understand his Church, some of these branches proved fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less cast-aways, were in time cast out of the Church, were gathered by men and burned.</p>
            <p>Fourteenthly, and Lastly, I will come to particular instances.</p>
            <p>1. The twelve had a devil among them. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 70.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> were in the Church of <hi>Jerusalem, Acts.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was among them
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:43328:58"/>
at <hi>Samaria, Acts.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>4. Among the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> were them that had not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Faul</hi> tells the <hi>Galatians,</hi> false brethren crept in unawares, and so does the Apostle <hi>Jude,</hi> and yet they were as quick-sighted to see as any now adays, <hi>Gala.</hi> 2. <hi>Jude.</hi> 3. 4.</p>
            <p>6. The Church in <hi>Sardis</hi> had but a few names in her to whom the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven belonged, <hi>Thou hast a few names even in</hi> Sardis <hi>which have not defiled their garments, and they shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. As for the Church of the <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceans,</hi> it is called a wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. So that put all things together, and I may boldly say as I also have said already, <hi>That among the multitude of them that shall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, professors will make a considerable party;</hi> or to speak in the words of the observation, <hi>when men have put</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:43328:59"/>
               <hi>in all the claim they can for heaven, but few will have it for their inheritance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will now shew you some reasons of the point, besides those five that I shewed you before.</p>
            <p>But first, I will shew you why the poor carnall ignorant world miss of heaven, and then why the knowing professors miss of it also.</p>
            <p>First, the poor carnal ignorant world miss of heaven, even because they love their sins, and cannot part with them; <hi>men love darkness rather then light because their deeds be evil, Joh.</hi> 3. the poor ignorant world miss of heaven, because they are enemies in their minds to God, his word and holyness: <hi>They all must be damned who take pleasure in unrighteousness;</hi> 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 10. 11. 12. The poor ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant world miss of heaven because they stop their ears against convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and refuse to come when God cals, <hi>because I have called and ye refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded, but have set at nought</hi>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:43328:59"/>
               <hi>all my counsels, and would none of my reproofs; I also will laugh at your cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and mock when your fear com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as desolution, and your destruction like a whirlwinde, when distress and anguish cometh upon you; then shall you call upon me, but I will not answer, they shall seek me early but shall not finde me, Pro.</hi> 1. 24. 25 26. 27. 28.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the poor ignorant world miss of heaven because the God of this world hath blinded their eyes, that they can neither see the evil, and damnable state they are in at present, nor the way to get out of it, neither do they see the beauty of Jesus Christ, nor how willing he is to save poor sinners 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 2. 3.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the poor ignorant world miss of heaven, because they putt off and defer coming to Christ, until the time of Gods patience and grace is over: some indeed are resolved ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to come, but some again say, we will come hereafter, and so it comes to pass, that <hi>because God called and</hi>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:43328:60"/>
               <hi>they did not hear, so they shall cry and I will not hear, saith the Lord. Zech.</hi> 7. 11. 12. 13.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the poor ignorant world miss of heaven, because they have false apprehensions of Gods mercy, <hi>they say in their hearts, we shall have peace, though we walk in the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our heart, to add drunkenness to thirst: but what</hi> saith the word, <hi>the Lord will not spare him, but then the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Lord and his jealousie shall smoak against that man, and all the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses that are written in this book shall be upon him, and God shall blot out his name from under heaven. Dent.</hi> 29. 19, 20, 21.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, the poor ignorant world miss of heaven, because they make light of the Gospel that offereth mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to them freely, and because they lean upon their own good meanings and thinkings and doings, <hi>Matt.</hi> 22. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 30, 31.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, The poor carnal world miss of heaven, because by unbelief, which reigns in them, they are kept
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:43328:60"/>
for ever from being cloathed with Christs righteousness, and from wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing in his blood, without which there is neither remission of sin, nor justification.</p>
            <p>But to pass these till anon.</p>
            <p>I come in the next place to shew you some reasons why the professor falls short of heaven.</p>
            <p>First, In the general, they rest in things below special grace, as in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakenings that are not special, in repentance that is not special, in faith that is not special, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and a little to run the parallel betwixt the one and the other, that if God will, you may see and escape.</p>
            <p>1. Have they that shall be saved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakenings about their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, so have they that shall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: they that never go to heaven may see much of sin and of the wrath of God due thereto: this had <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> and yet they came short of the kingdom. <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. <hi>Matt.</hi> 27. 4. The saved have convictions in order
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:43328:61"/>
to their eternal life, but the others convictions are not so: the convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the one doth drive them sincer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Christ, the convictions of the other doth drive them to the law, and the law to desperation at last.</p>
            <p>2. There are also convictions that shew a man his necessity of Christ, but wanting grace to lay hold ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually on Christ, they joyn the law also with the Savior, and so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, or through despair of obtaining the power of grace, they rest in the notions and profession of grace, and so perish.</p>
            <p>3. There is a repentance that will not save, a repentance to be repented of, and a repentance to salvation, not to be repented of, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10. yet so great a similitude, and likeness there is betwixt the one and the other, that most times the wrong is taken for the right, and through this mistake professors perish.</p>
            <p>As 1. In saving repentance there will be an acknowledgement of sin;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:43328:61"/>
and one that hath the other repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance may acknowledg his sins also, <hi>Matt.</hi> 27. 4.</p>
            <p>2. In saving repentance there is a crying out under sin, but one that hath the other repentance may cry out under sin also, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 13.</p>
            <p>3. In saving repentance there will be humiliation for sin, and one that hath the other repentance may hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himself also, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21. 29.</p>
            <p>4. Saving repentance is attended with self-loathing, but he that hath the other repentance may have loath<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing of sin too, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 22. a loathing of sin, <hi>because</hi> it is sin, that he cannot have, but a loathing of sin because i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is offensive to him, that he may have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the dog doth not loath that which troubleth his stomach because it is there, but because it troubleth him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when it has done troubling of him, he can turn to it again, and li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k it up as before it troubled him.</p>
            <p>5. Saving repentance is attended with prayers and tears, but he that hath
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:43328:62"/>
none but the other repentance, may have prayers and tears also<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 34, 35. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14, 15, 16.</p>
            <p>6. In saving repentance there is fear and reverence of the word, and Ministers, that bring it; but this may be also where there is none but the repentance that is not saving: <hi>for</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod <hi>feared</hi> John, <hi>knowing that he was a just man, and holy, and observed him; when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly, Mark.</hi> 6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>0.</p>
            <p>7. Saving repentance makes a mans heart very tender of doing any thing against the word of God: But <hi>Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> could say, <hi>If</hi> Balak <hi>would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord, Numb.</hi> 24. 13. Behold, then how far a man may go in repentance, and yet be short of that which is called <hi>repentance unto salvation not to be repented of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. He may be awakened. 2. he may acknowledge his sin. 3. he may cry out under the burden of sin. 4. he may have humility for it. 5. he may
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:43328:62"/>
loath it. 6. may have prayers and tears against it. 7. may delight to do many things of God. 8. may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of sinning against him, and after all this may perish for want of saving repentance.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Have they that <hi>shall</hi> be saved, <hi>faith;</hi> why they that <hi>shall not</hi> be saved, <hi>may have faith also.</hi> Yea a faith in many things, <hi>so like</hi> the faith that <hi>saveth,</hi> that they can <hi>hardly</hi> be distinguished (though they differ, both in root and branch:) to come to particulars.</p>
            <p>1. Saving faith hath Christ for its object, and so may the faith have that is not saving; those very <hi>Jews,</hi> of whom it is said, they believed on Christ; Christ tells them, and that after their believing: <hi>you are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. Jo.</hi> 8. from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 30. to <hi>v</hi> 44</p>
            <p>2. Saving faith is wrought by the word of God, and so may the faith be, that is not saving, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. 13.</p>
            <p>3. Saving faith looks for justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:43328:63"/>
without works, and so may a faith do that is not saving, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 18.</p>
            <p>4. Saving faith will sanctifie and purify the heart and the faith that is not saving may work a man off from the pollutions of the world, as it did <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Demas,</hi> and others, see 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>5. Saving faith will give a man tasts of the world to come, and also joy by them tasts, and so will the faith do that is not saving, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4. 5. <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 13.</p>
            <p>6. Saving faith will help a man, if called thereto, to give his body to be burned for his religion, and so will the faith do to that is not saving, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 1. 2. 3. 4.</p>
            <p>7. Saving faith will help a man to look for an inheritance in the world to come, and that may the faith do that is not saving: <hi>all those virgins took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom, Matt.</hi> 25. 1.</p>
            <p>8. Saving faith will not only make a man look for, but prepare to meet
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:43328:63"/>
the bridegroom, and so may the saith do that is not saving; <hi>then all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se virgins arose and trimmed their lamps, Matt.</hi> 25. 7.</p>
            <p>9. Saving faith will make a man look for an interest in the kingdom of heaven with confidence, and the faith that is not saving will even demand entrance of the Lord: <hi>Lord, Lord, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen unto us; Matt.</hi> 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 11.</p>
            <p>10. Saving faith will have <hi>good</hi> works follow it <hi>into heaven,</hi> and the faith that is not saving, may have <hi>great</hi> works follow it, <hi>as far as to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven gates, Lord, have we not prophesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thy name, and in thy name cast out devils, and in thy name done many wondrous works. Matt.</hi> 7. 22.</p>
            <p>Now then, if the saith that is not saving, may have Christ for its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, be wrought by the word, look for justification without works, work men off from the pollutions of the world, and give men tasts of, and joy in the things of another world; I say, again, if it will help a man to bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:43328:64"/>
for his Judgment, and to look for an inheritance in another world, yet if it will help a man to to prepare for it, claim interest in it, and if it can car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>great</hi> works, <hi>many</hi> great and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous works as far as heaven gates, then no marvel if abundance of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple take this faith for the saving faith, and so fall short of heaven thereby.

is; 1. partly because we cannot infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly, at all times, distinguish grace that saveth, from that which doth but appear to do so. 2. partly also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause some men have the art to give right names to wrong things. 3. and partly because we being commanded to receive <hi>him that is weak,</hi> are afraid to exclude the least Christian, by a hid means<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hypocrites creep into the Churches, but what saith the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? <hi>I the Lord search the heart, I try the reins: And</hi> again, <hi>all the Churches shall know that I am he that searches the reins and hearts, and I will give to every one of you, according to your works: Jer.</hi> 11. 20. <hi>chap.</hi> 17. 10. <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 23.

            <p>I come now to make some brief Use and Application of the whole:
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:43328:66"/>
and my first word shall be to the open profane: poor sinner, thou readest here, that but a few will be saved, that many that expect heaven, will go without heaven; what saist thou to this, poor sinner?

Thou maist wish thy self another man, but that will not help thee sinner; thou maist wish, <hi>would I had been converted in time,</hi> but that will not help thee neither; and if like the wise of <hi>Jeroboam, thou shouldest fain thy self to be another wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> the prophet, the Lord Jesus would soon finde thee out; what wilt thou do poor sinner: heavy tidings,

            <p>Secondly, my second word is to them that are upon the potters wheel, concerning whom, we know not, as yet, whether their convictions, and awaknings will end in conversion or no; several things I should say to you, both to further your convictions, and to caution you from staying any where below, or short of saving grace.</p>
            <p>1. Remember that but few shall be saved, and if God should count thee worthy to be one of that few, what a mercy would that be. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 45.</p>
            <p>2. Be thankful therefore for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, conversion begins at convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, though all conviction doth not end in conversion. It is a great mercy to be convinced that we are sinners, and that we need a Saviour, count it therefore a mercy, and that thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions

            <p>First, I begin with you whose re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion lieth only in your tongues, I mean you who are little or nothing known from the rest of the rabble of the world, only you can talk better
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:43328:72"/>
then they: hear me a word or two. <hi>If I speak with the tongue of men and angels, and have not charity,</hi> that is, love to God, and Christ, and saints, and holyness, <hi>I am nothing,</hi> no child of God; and so have nothing to do with heaven, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. a prating tongue will not unlock the gates of heaven, nor blinde the eyes of thy judge; look to it: the wise in heart will receive commandments but a prating fool shall fall: <hi>Pro.</hi> 10. 8.</p>
            <p>Secondly, covetous professor, thou that mak'n a gain of religion, that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest thy profession to bring grift to thy mill; look to it also, gain is not god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyness; <hi>Iudas's</hi> religion lay much in the bag, but his soul is now burning in hell; all covetousness is Idolatry, but what is <hi>that</hi> or what will you <hi>call it,</hi> when men are religions for filthy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uke, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 31.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, wanton professors I have a word for you; I mean, you that can tell how to misplead Scripture, to maintain your pride, your ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queting,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:43328:73"/>
and abominable idolatry: reade what <hi>Peter</hi> says, you are the share and damnation of others; <hi>you allure through the lust of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in errour,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 18. besides the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost hath a great deal against you, for your feastings, and eating without fear, not for health, but gluttony: <hi>Jud.</hi> 12. further <hi>Peter</hi> saies, that you that count it pleasure to riot in the day time, <hi>are spots and blemishes, sporting your selves with your own deceivings.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13. And let me ask, did God give his word to justifie your wickedness, or doth grace teach you to plead for the flesh, or the waking provision for the lusts thereof; of these, also are they that feed their bodyes to strengthen their lusts under pretence of strengthning frail nature. But pray remember the text, <hi>many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, I come next to the <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nionist,</hi>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:43328:73"/>
I mean to him whose religion lieth in some circumstantials of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; with this sort this kingdom swarms at this day; these think all out of the way that are not of their mode, when themselves may be out of the way in the midest of their zeal for their opinions, pray do you also observe the text, <hi>many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, &amp; shall not be able.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, neither is the <hi>formalist</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from this number: he is a man that hath <hi>lost all</hi> but the <hi>shell</hi> of religion, he is hot indeed for his form, and no marvel, for that is his <hi>all</hi> to contend for, but his form being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the power and spirit of godly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, it will leave him in his fins; nay, he standeth now in them, in the sight of God, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>and is one of the many that will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, The <hi>legalist</hi> comes next, even him that hath no life but what he makes out of duties, this man, hath chosen to stand and fall by <hi>Moses</hi> who
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:43328:74"/>
is the condemner of the world, <hi>there is one that accuseth you, even</hi> Moses <hi>in whom ye trust.</hi> Joh. 5. 45.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, There is in the next place the <hi>libertine,</hi> he that pretendeth to be against forms, and duties, as things that gender to bondage, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the order of God: this man pretends to pray always, but under that pretence, prays not at all; he pretends to keep every day a sabath, but this pretence serves him only to cast off all set times for the worship of God. <hi>This is also one of the many that will seek to enter in and shall not be able.</hi> Tit. 1. 16.</p>
            <p>Eightly, There is the <hi>temporizing Latitudinarian,</hi> he is a man that hath no God but his belly, nor any religion but that by which his belly is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiped, his religion is always like the times, turning this way and that way, like the cock on the steeple, neither hath he any conscience but a benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or seared one, and is next door to a down right athiest, <hi>and also is one of</hi>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:43328:74"/>
               <hi>them many that will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ninthly, There is also the <hi>wilfully ignorant</hi> professor, or him that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to know more, for fear of the cross; he is for picking and chusing of truth, and loveth not to hazzard his all for that worthy name by which he would be called: when he is at any time overset by arguments, or awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of conscience, he uses to heal all, by, <hi>I was not brought up in this faith,</hi> as if it were unlawful for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to know more then hath been taught them at first conversion, there are many Scriptures that lie against this man, <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> of great guns,</hi> and <hi>he is one of the many that will seek to enter in and shall not be able.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tenthly, we will add to all these, the professor that would prove him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a Christian by comparing himself with others, insteed of comparing himself with the word of God. This man comforts himself because he is as holy as such, and such: he also knows
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:43328:75"/>
as much as that old professor, and then concludes he shall go to heaven: as if he certainly knew, that those with whom he compareth himself would be undoubtedly saved, but how if he should be mistaken, nay may they not both fall short; but to besure he is in the wrong that hath made the comparison. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 12. and a wrong foundation will not stand in the day of Judgment. This man therefore <hi>is one of the many that will seek to enter in &amp; shall not be able.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eleventhly, There is yet another professor; and he is for God and for Baal too, he can be <hi>any</hi> thing, for <hi>any</hi> company: he can throw stones with both hands, his religion alters as fast as his company: he is a frog of <hi>Egypt</hi> and can live <hi>in</hi> the water, and <hi>out</hi> of the water, he can live in religious company and again as well out, <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> that is <hi>disorderly</hi> comes a miss to him, he'll <hi>hold</hi> with the <hi>hair,</hi> and <hi>run</hi> with the <hi>hound,</hi> he carries <hi>fire</hi> in <hi>one</hi> hand, and <hi>water</hi> i'th <hi>t'other;</hi> he is a
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:43328:75"/>
very <hi>any</hi> thing but what he <hi>should</hi> be: <hi>This is also one of the many that will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Twel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>thly, There is also <hi>that</hi> free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willer who denies to the holy Ghost the sole work in conversion, and <hi>that</hi> Socinian, who denieth to Christ that he hath made to God satisfaction for sin: and <hi>that</hi> Quaker who takes from Christ the true natures in his person, &amp; I might add as many more: touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whose damnation (they dying as they are) the Scripture is plain: <hi>these will seek to enter in &amp; shall not be able.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Fourthly, if it be so, what a strange disapointment, wil many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors meet with at the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: I speak not now to the open profaner, every body (as I have said) that hath but common under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing between good and evil, knows that they are in the broad way to hell and damnation, and they must needs come thither, nothing can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inder it, but repentance unto salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, except God should prove a lier to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:43328:76"/>
save them, &amp; tis hard ventring of that.</p>
            <p>Neither is it amiss, if we take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the examples that are briefly mentioned in the Scriptures concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing professors that have miscarried.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Judas</hi> perished from among the Apostles. <hi>Acts.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Demas</hi> as I think perished from among the Evangelists 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 10. 3. <hi>Diotrephes</hi> from among the Ministers, or them in office in the Church. 3. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9. 10. 4. And as for Christian professors, they have sell by heaps, and almost by whole Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Revel.</hi>

Let us adde to these, that the things mentioned in the Scriptures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout these matters, are but brief hints, and <hi>items</hi> of what is afterwards to happen; as the Apostle said; <hi>some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               </gap>, fifthly, As this disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be fearful, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:43328:77"/>2. Will it not be amazing to them to see their own madness and folly, while they consider how they have dallyed with their own souls, and took lightly for granted, that they had that grace that would save them but hath left them in damnable state.</p>
            <p>3. Will they not also be amazed one at another, while they remember how in their life time, they counted themselves fellow-heirs of life. To allude to that of the prophet: <hi>they shall be amazed one of another, their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces shall be as flames. Isa.</hi> 13. 8.</p>
            <p>4. Will it not be amazing to some of the damned <hi>themselves,</hi> to see some come to <hi>hell</hi> that then they shall see come <hi>thither.</hi> To see preachers of the word; professors of the word, practisers in the word, to come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; what wondring was there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>them</hi> at the fall of the king of <hi>Babilon,</hi> since he thought to have swallowed up all because he was run down by the <hi>Modes</hi> and <hi>Persians, how art thou fallen from heaven Lucifer,</hi>

               <hi>sun of the morning?</hi> how art thou cut down to the ground that didst wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the nations? If such a thing as this, will with amazement, surprize the damned, what an amazement will it be to them to see such an one as he, <hi>whose head reached to the clouds:</hi> to see him come down to the pit, and perish for ever like his own dung. <hi>Hell from beneath is moved for thee, to meet thee at thy coming, it stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth. Isa.</hi> 14. they that see thee, shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Sixthly, yet again, one word more, if I may awaken professors 1. consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, though the poor carnal world, shall certainly perish, yet they will want these things to aggravate their sorrow which thou wilt meet with in
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:43328:78"/>
every thought that thou wilt have of the condition thou wast in when thou wast in the world.</p>
            <p>1. They will not have a profession to bite them when they come thither.</p>
            <p>2. They will not have the tasts of a lost heaven, to bite them when they come thither.</p>
            <p>3. They will not have the thoughts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of, <hi>I was almost at heaven,</hi> to bite them when they came thither.</p>
            <p>4. They will not have, the thoughts of, how they cheated saints, Ministers, Churches, to bite them, when they come thither.</p>
            <p>5. They will not have the dying thoughts of false faith, false hope, false repentance, and false holyness to bite them when they come thither. <hi>I was at the gates of heaven, I looked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heaven, I thought I should have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into heaven! O how will these things sting! they will, if I may call them so, be the sting of the sting of death in hell fire.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:43328:78"/>Seventhly, Give me leave now in a word, to give you a little advice.</p>
            <p>1. Doest thou love thine own soul, then pray to Jesus Christ for an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakned heart, for an heart so awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, with all the things of another world, that thou maiest be allured to Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>2. When thou comest there, beg a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain for more awaknings about sin, hell, grace, and about the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ.</p>
            <p>3. Cry also for a spirit of discerning, that thou maist know that which is saving-grace indeed.</p>
            <p>4. Above all studies, apply thy self to the study of those things, that shew thee the evil of sin, the shortness of mens life, and which is the way to be saved.</p>
            <p>5. Keep company with the most godly among professors.</p>
            <p>6. When thou hearest what the nature of true grace is, defer not to ask thine own heart, if this grace be there; and here take heed,</p>

            <p>2. That thou takest not seeming graces for real ones, nor seeming fruits for real fruits.</p>
            <p>3. Take heed that <hi>a sin and thy life goes not unrepented of,</hi> for that will make a <hi>
