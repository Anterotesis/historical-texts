            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For to whom could I with so

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I Am afraid the Reader need not be inform'd that these are youthful Poems. I have now spent very little more than a third part of my <hi>threescore years and ten,</hi> and I was much younger when many o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ese Poems were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. Indeed they were generally the Performances of a School-boy or a Fresh-man; which I hope may in some measure excuse the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of some of them, and the meanness of all. The Translation
<pb facs="tcp:57448:5"/>
of that part of <hi>Virgil,</hi> which I here publish, was indeed a work of time, and crept upon me at broken Hours: when, tir'd with Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Studies, I chose to let down my Soul, and prepare my self for Conversation, by entertaining my thoughts with the Elegancies of that unimitable Poet. Being pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his Thoughts in Latin, it was natural to try how they would look in <hi>English,</hi> and that Trial produced a Verse, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, another; till at length I found my self far gone in a bold Work, before I knew what I was doing. Such as it is I now present it to
<pb facs="tcp:57448:5"/>
publick view. And, tho' I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it every way unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the Original; yet methinks there is nothing which I can so hardly forgive my self, as that I took such pains to make it worse than I needed. I mean, by confin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my self to Rhime, when blank Verse, as it would have been more easie, so I am perswaded it would have been more natural. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks blank Verse carries in it somewhat of the Majesty of <hi>Virgil</hi>; when Rhimes, even the most happy of them (after tedious pumping for them, and having good Expressions balk'd for want of
<pb facs="tcp:57448:6"/>
them) do but emasculate Heroick Verse, and give it an unnatural Softness. In Songs, Pastorals, and the softer sorts of Poetry, Rhimes may perhaps be not unelegantly retain'd; but an Heroe drest up in them looks like <hi>Hercules</hi> with a Distaff. I have there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ore annex'd a few Specimens of <hi>Virgil</hi> Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in blank Verse; and because I would be impartial, I took the beginnings of the three next Books. I hope my Failings will not be an Argument against my Opinion; for tho' I am unable to perform so great a Task, yet I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade my self that, if a <hi>Dryden</hi> (a
<pb facs="tcp:57448:6"/>
Master of our Language and Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try) would undertake to Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late <hi>Virgil</hi> in blank Verse, we might hope to read him with as great pleasure in our Language, as his own. Whether I have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried this Humour too far in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Blank <hi>Pindarique Ode,</hi> let o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers judge: only this I have to say, that the licentiousness of Rhiming, which is usual in that sort of Poetry among us, will make the want of it less discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; at least it will clear me from the imputation of chusing Blank Verse out of Laziness.</p>
