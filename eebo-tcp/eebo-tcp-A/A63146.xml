            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>'T</hi>IS no leſs deplorable than won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that in this Nation where the pureſt Religion is profeſs'd, and where Vice and Immorality are puniſh'd by ſevere Laws, Wickedneſs ſhould aſcend to ſuch a height, as equals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if not exceeds, all the Barbarous Regions of the Earth. Time was, when groſs enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in this Iſland, like <hi>Batts</hi> and <hi>Owls</hi> were obſcur'd by Night and Darkneſs, and thoſe that committed them were aſham'd to own their Crimes, or ſuffer their Examples to infect the open Air. They were conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to go to Hell alone, without Uſurping the Office of <hi>Belzebub,</hi> or loading their Souls with the Guilt of <hi>Tempting</hi> their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautious Brethren; but now the moſt <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, Inhuman, Unnatural, and Beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Offences,</hi> ſtalk abroad at Noon day, and he thinks himſelf a <hi>Puny</hi> in Wickedneſs, and
<pb facs="tcp:35630:3"/>
               <hi>ſcarce worth the Damning,</hi> that can't boaſt of numbers of Souls that he has lead to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Raviſhing Women,</hi> was a Crime rarely heard of among our Anceſtors, and though no Age has been ſo happy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it has produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſome <hi>Monſters</hi> in Morality, as well as Nature; yet now this Sin is grown ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that ſcarce a <hi>Seſſions</hi> paſſes, wherein there is not one or more Convicted of <hi>Rape,</hi> and that in the moſt Scandalous manner too, upon the Bodies of meer Children.</p>
            <p>Nay, the Debauches of this Age have found out another way of <hi>Raviſhing Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> and that is, of their <hi>Honours</hi> and <hi>Reputations;</hi> for where the <hi>Villains</hi> have impudently aſſaulted the <hi>Chaſtity</hi> of Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Women, and have encountred nothing but <hi>Scorns,</hi> or the <hi>Baſtinado</hi> from a Foot-Man; there they'll be ſure to fix a Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, and boaſt of the Favours they ne'er re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. Nay, a Fellow that has neither <hi>Sence</hi> in his Head, <hi>Money</hi> in Pocket, nor a <hi>Tatter</hi> to his Back, but what a <hi>Louſe</hi> wou'd break its Neck from, ſhall dignifie himſelf <hi>Gallant</hi> to perſons of the <hi>Beſt Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> that ne'er could reach above the Rank of a <hi>Dung-hill-raker<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
            </p>

               <pb facs="tcp:35630:3"/>
Another Abomination that ſhocks our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and puts our Modeſty to the Bluſh, to ſee it ſo commonly perpetrated, is the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villiſh and Unnatural Sin of Buggery.</hi> A Crime that ſinks a Man below the <hi>Baſeſt</hi> Epithet, is ſo <hi>Foul</hi> it admits of no Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and cannot be expreſs'd in its Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, but by the <hi>Doleful Shrikes and Groans of the Damned.</hi> A Sin that caus'd God Almighty <hi>Pluere Gehennam de Coelo,</hi> to Rain down Hell-Fire upon <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and turn a Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Pleaſant Country, into utter Barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Deſolation.</p>
            <p>This Sin being now Tranſlated from the <hi>Sadomitical</hi> Original, or from the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Copies into <hi>Engliſh;</hi> not only in the Infamous Example of that Monſter <hi>Ri—by,</hi> and other Notorious <hi>Sodomites;</hi> but he<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

in its Horrid Shape, and ugly Viſage, by the Grave and Learned Sages of the Law, and in the Death of a Noble Peer, other Men might be terrify'd, and ſcar'd from thoſe Sins that are attended with nothing but Infamy and Death in this World, and Eternal Damnation in the next. And,</p>
            <p>Now, ſeeing I have ſome Paper left, give me leave to tell the Miſcreants of our unhappy Days, that the preceding Sins of <hi>Sodom,</hi> which ſpaun'd the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural</hi> Sin of <hi>Buggery, were the ſame that now Reign among our</hi> Engliſh <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauche's,</hi> and as they would avoid the Effects, ſo they ought to be careful in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the Cauſe, or without the help of Prophecy, 'tis eaſie to foretel their R<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Pride, Luxury,</hi> and <hi>Irreligion,</hi> were the Infernal Parents of <hi>Sodomy,</hi> and that of their Deſtruction: And he muſt have neither Eyes, nor Ears, that knows not how egregiouſly the ſame Vices Reign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us alſo. <hi>Pride</hi> is in its Achme, and nothing ſo much admir'd as <hi>Eaſe</hi> and <hi>Softneſs, Courtſhip, Addreſs,</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment,</hi> And that <hi>Delicata Inſania,</hi> Effeminate Madneſs, had baniſh'd all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Vertues.

            <p>But the great Qualification they Boaſt of, and which wholly imploys our Modern Wits, is in <hi>Belching out Blaſphemy againſt the God that made them, and throwing bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Scoffs and Prophane Jeſts upon Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi> and having no other way to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate their Courage, they ſhew it in this: <hi>That they dare venture to be Damn'd to be accounted Contemptibly Witty.</hi> But if they are not already ſo far ſunk into <hi>Beaſt,</hi> as they have loſt the benefit of <hi>Thinking,</hi> I wou'd faign ſtop their Career by a few Modeſt Queſtions, <hi>viz.

The Matters of Fact are to be prov'd by Evidence, and your Lordſhips are to balance it. I have already obſerved to you, that probably this Cauſe may move ſome of you into Pity, and others into Deteſtation; but neither of theſe ought to be thrown into ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, ſince a Grain on either ſide may ſway the Scales; Therefore let Reaſon rule your Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and your Heads govern your Hearts; hear diligently, weigh matters equally, and then the Scale will lean on the right ſide. The Judges will aſſiſt your Lordſhips in point of Law, and therefore if any doubt ariſeth among you, you'll propound it to me, and I to them. In theſe proceedings your Lordſhips are not upon your Corporal Oaths, for the Law preſumes you of ſuch Honour and Integrity, that you will act as Juſtly without an Oath, as others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Obligation; and for the ſame Reaſon the Law admits of no Challenges. God direct you to do it.</p>

His Lordſhip having concluded, the King's Attorney General opened the Indictment in the following Words.</p>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Grace my Lord High Steward; here are two Indictments againſt <hi>Mervyn</hi> Lord <hi>Audley,</hi> the firſt is for <hi>Rape,</hi> and the ſecond is for <hi>Sodomy;</hi> the Priſoner is Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable, the Crimes of which he ſtands In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted are foul and Diſhonourable, and if they ſhould be prov'd true, I dare be bold to ſay, <hi>That never Poet invented, nor Hiſtorian related any thing ſo Odious, Inhuman, and abominable. Suetonius</hi> has with Horror diſplay'd the Vices of ſome Heathen Emperors, that having ingroſs'd an abſolute power, were fearleſs of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſhameleſs in committing abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Enormites; yet no Author has produc'd a Man that ever equal'd, or came near the Crimes that this Lord is accus'd of. This is a Crime, to the Honour of our Nation be it ſpoken, <hi>that is ſcarcely heard of in an Age,</hi> and whenever it happens calls aloud for timely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, <hi>that the Infection ſpread no farther, nor provoke Divine Vengeance to pour down the Vials of his wrath upon the whole Kingdom.</hi> I can ſpeak it with great ſatisfaction, That in all King <hi>James</hi>'s Reign, and from his Majeſties firſt Acceſſion to the Crown, till now, I never heard the like occaſion to ſpeak againſt <hi>a Peer of the Realm;</hi> and as God knows I do it now with abundance of Regret, ſo I hope I ſhall never have the like occaſion to do it any more. His Majeſty who is your Pattern of Vertue, not only as a King, but in his perſonal Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and of whom it is hard to ſay, whether
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:35630:10"/>
he excels moſt in Juſtice, or Mercy, (tho' I am inclin'd to believe 'tis in his Mercy) would have my Lord <hi>Audley,</hi> the Priſoner at the Bar, heard with as much favour as a Crime of that Horrid Nature will allow. When the Notice of this Crime came firſt to His Majeſty's knowledge, he was amazed, and gave ſtrick command that the Truth might appear, <hi>and his Throne and People might be cleard from the Guilt of ſuch abominable impieties;</hi> therefore the Priſoner was Indicted according to Law in his own Country, and by Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of known Worth and Integrity; <hi>Billa Vera</hi> being found againſt him, he is brought to this Bar to be Tryed by theſe Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lords his Peers; of whoſe Wiſdom and Juſtice there can be no queſtion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may expect the Event accordingly: Firſt I ſhall begin with the <hi>Rape.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now <hi>Rape</hi> is defin'd to be <hi>an Unlawful Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Knowledge, and Abuſe of a Woman by Force againſt her Will.</hi> This was Felony by the Common Law, and tho' the Statute of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 13. leſſen'd it into a Miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor, yet it was ſoon after 13. <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. <hi>C.</hi> 34. made a Capital Offence without Clergy, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Law of the Almighty Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 34. and was accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by our Fore-Fathers, ſo Deteſtable and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable a Crime, <hi>Bracton, l.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 147, that thoſe who were guilty of it, were puniſh'd <hi>with the Loſs of their Eyes, and their Privy Members, that they might at once be deprived of the wicked Inlets, and Inſtruments of their Baſe and Unlawful Luſts;</hi> but I ſhall not Tyre your
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:35630:10"/>
Lordſhips patience with Citing Authorities, nor inlarging upon the Hainouſneſs of an Offence that admits of no aggravation, and therefore ſhall only mention three or four Rules in Law, relating to the preſent Caſe; the Truth of which I ſubmit to the Opinions of my Lords the Judges.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> When any Offence is Felony, either by the Statute, or Common Law, all Acceſſaries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after, are incidently included, ſo that if any be aiding, aſſiſting, or abettiag any to do the Act, tho' the Offence be perſonal, and done by one only, as is in this Caſe, not only he that doth the Act is Principal, but alſo they that are preſent, Abetting, and Aiding the Miſdoer, are Principals alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> If the party on whom the Crimes was Committed, be notoriouſly Unchaſt, and a known Whore, yet there may be a Raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, In an Indictment of Rape,</hi> there is no Limitation of time for the proſecution; <hi>for</hi> Nullum tempus occurrit Regi, no time occurs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, or prevents the King<hi>'s</hi> Suit; but in caſe of an Appeal of Rape, if the Woman do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute in Convenient time, it will bar her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If a Man take away a Maid and Raviſh her by Force, and afterward ſhe gives her conſent and Marries him that did the Act, yet it is a Rape.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Crimen Sodomiticum,</hi> in the ſecond Indictment, I ſhall not Paraphraſe upon it, ſince <hi>it is of ſo abominable and Vile a Nature,</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:35630:11"/>
(that as the Indictment truly expreſſes it, <hi>Crimen inter Chriſtianos non nominandum) it is a Crime not to be named among Chriſtians;</hi> and by the Law of God, as well as the Antient Laws of <hi>England,</hi> it was puniſh'd with Death. <hi>Levit.</hi> 20. <hi>Fleta, l.</hi> 6. <hi>Cap.</hi> 35. <hi>Sodomitae in terra vivi confodiantur: Sodomites are to be buried alive in the Earth;</hi> or rather as ſome underſtand the Phraſe, be ſet deep and alive into a Pit dig'd for that purpoſe, with their heads above ground, till they are famiſh'd to Death, and this agrees with the <hi>Mirror, Cap.</hi> 4. The Statute of 25. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>Cap.</hi> 6. made it <hi>Felony</hi> without Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, which tho' Repeal'd by 1. <hi>Mar,</hi> yet it was revived by the 5. <hi>El. Cap.</hi> 17. and is ſtill in Force.</p>
               <p>As to this Indictment there is no other Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, but whether it be <hi>Crimen Sodomiticum penetratione,</hi> whether he penetrated the Body, or not; to which I anſwer, the Fifth of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ſets it down in general Terms, and <hi>ubi Lex non diſtinguit, ibi non diſtinguen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum;</hi> and I know you will be cautious how you give the leaſt Mittigation to ſuch abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Sins; for when once a Man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulges his Luſt, and Prevaricates with his Religion, as my Lord <hi>Audley</hi> has done, by being a Proteſtant in the Morning, and a Papiſt in the Af<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But here I find things that exceed all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and is what the Poet truly Calls <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>principiti vitium,</hi> or meditated miſchiefs, for
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:35630:11"/>
his ill inclinations were bent, to force his Wife to be naught againſt her own Inclinations, which the wickedeſt Man I ever heard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would have Vertuous and Honeſt, how bad ſoever he is himſelf; but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the Priſoner at the Bar tells his Wife, if ſhe loves him, ſhe muſt love <hi>Antill</hi> his Servant alſo; and to incline the Lady to lie with him, he fetcheth an argument from Scripture, and tells her, that her Body is his, and that ſhe is bound to obey his Commands; and if ſhe Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in obeying him, it was no fault of hers, but his own, and he would anſwer for it. He allowed this <hi>Antill,</hi> his vitious favorite, to ſpend Five Hundred Pounds a Year; but would not allow his Eldeſt Son One Hundred. If his Lady or Daughter wanted neceſſaries, they muſt lie with <hi>Skipwith,</hi> another of his Servants, before they could have Money to buy what they wanted, telling his Daughter he had rather ſhe ſhould have a Child by <hi>Skipwith,</hi> than any other perſon; but theſe things, my Lord, I had rather ſhould come out of the Mouths of the Witneſſes than from mine; therefore, pray <hi>Cryer,</hi> call <hi>Walter Tyte.</hi>

               <p>O think upon the Turpitude of your Offences, with an unfeigned Sorrow, and a Sincere Repentance; and as your Crimes have been Abominable, ſo let your Mortification for them be as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable. 'Tis not a ſlight and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Contrition can obliterate your Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:35630:18"/>
for you have not only Sin'd againſt the Law of God and Nature, but againſt the Rage of Man, Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; and though you are not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd for that enormity, you caus'd your Daughter to be abuſed, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Honour and Fortune to leave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind you, would have the ſpurious Iſſue of a Varlet to Inherit both. My <hi>Lord,</hi> I am ſorry to ſee you ſo unconcerned, and that you diſcover no ſigns of Sorrow, or Repentance, for the Crimes you have Committed. How are you obliged to bleſs God, that his Judgments did not ſeize and hurry you away, with the load of theſe Sins upon your Conſcience, and in the very Act of your Filthineſs; but has (I hope) reſerv'd you as a Subject of his Mercy, and when you were blinded in your Sins, has brought you to this day of Shame, that the ſight of them might turn you to him by Shame, Sorrow, and Repentance. Theſe, my <hi>Lord,</hi> are Arguments that invite you to lay hold of his Mercy, and ſecure a happy Eternity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I adviſe you, to improve this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and for the few Moments you have to Live, indeavour to waſh
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:35630:18"/>
away your Crimes in Tears of true Repentance, for the many Crimes you have Committed; That the Sentence I am going to Pronounce, may prevent your dreadful Doom from God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.</p>
               <p>The SENTENCE. For as much as Thou <hi>Mervyn</hi> Lord <hi>Audley,</hi> haſt been Indicted of divers Fellonies, and by thy Peers haſt been found <hi>Guilty</hi> of them, thy SENTENCE therefore is, <hi>That Thou return to the place from whence Thou cameſt, and from thence to the place of Execution, and there be Hang'd by the Neck, till thy Body be Dead.</hi> And the Lord have Mercy on Thee.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lord Audley</hi> hearing his Sentence, fell upon his Knees, denied the Fact, and deſired the Lords to intercede with His Majeſty, to grant him a little time to reconcile himſelf to God; which their Lordſhips promiſed they would, and then the Court was diſſolved.</p>
               <p>At the Interceſſion of the Lords, he had time given him by the King till <hi>Saturday</hi> the Fourteenth of <hi>May,</hi> and the SENTENCE was changed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:35630:19"/>
into that of <hi>Beheading.</hi> His Coffin was ſent to him about a Week be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Death, and he was daily vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited by Dr. <hi>Wickham,</hi> Dean of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to prepare himſelf for his Diſſolution. The Day of his Execution being come, he aſcended a Scaffold on <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> in a plain Black Grogram Suit, a fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Band, and a Black Hat without a Band; Accompanied by Dr. <hi>Winnerf,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Wickham,</hi> and ſeveral Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Gentlemen. Then he addreſs'd himſelf to Prayers, and having done, he ſtood upon his Legs, and leaning upon the two Deans, after a ſhort and private Conference with them, he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Lords and ſpoke as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>I Thankfully acknowledge the great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Almighty God, whoſe Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty has beſtow'd upon me Honour, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and other Endowments, which I have miſpent in a Vicious Life, and have juſtly deſerv'd Death, as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of my Sins againſt God; but for the two Heinous Crimes for which I am now to Suffer, <hi>I deny them upon my Death,</hi> and freely forgive all that have been any way acceſſary to it; even as
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:35630:19"/>
heartily as I deſire Forgiveneſs at the Hands of God, which I hope to obtain through his Infinite Goodneſs and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and the aſſiſtance of your Prayers, which I humbly beg of your Lordſhips, and this whole Aſſembly.</p>
                  <p>It has been Reported to my Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that I have been unſetled in my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and therefore I have made a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of it to theſe two worthy Doctors, and have Publiſh'd it in Print under my Hand a Week ſince, and do now again Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all the Errors and Superſtitions Taught by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church; and declare my ſelf a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly Believe all the Articles of that Church, as they are confirmed by Authority of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
                  <p>Having thus acquainted you with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of my Faith, I muſt next acknowledge the great Juſtice and Mercy of the King's Majeſty. His Juſtice in bringing me to a Tryal, and his Mercy in appointing me to be Tryed by ſuch Noble Peers, and in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning me this kind of Death, rather than that pronounc'd in my Sentence; but above all, for giving me ſo long a time to repent
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:35630:20"/>
in, and ſending theſe two worthy Divines to aſſiſt me; for I hope, nay, can ſpeak it to my Comfort, that I have made ſuch good uſe of theſe Favours, that I am fully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to Die, and before you all give my hearty Thanks to theſe two good Men, for the great pains they have taken in coming to me, praying for me, and Preaching and Reading to me; and I deſire your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips will give my humble Thanks to the King for ſending them to me, and for all the reſt of his Favours; for which I pray God to Bleſs His Majeſty, the Queen, the young Prince, the King and Queen of <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> and all the Royal Family. And now my Lords, and all you who are Spectators, I humbly requeſt you that you would remove your Eyes from me, and your Thoughts from what I am to ſuffer, and lift up your Eyes, your Hands, and your Hearts, to Heaven in Prayer for me; and ſo I take my laſt Farewell of your Lordſhips, and all the World.</p>
               </q>
               <p>After this, his Lordſhip betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his private Prayers, and then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſt, and prepar'd himſelf to receive the Fatal Stroke: Then taking leave again of the Lords and Doctors, he prayed a while by himſelf, pull'd his
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:35630:20"/>
Hankerchief over his Face, laid his Neck upon the Block, and having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the <hi>Sign,</hi> the Executioner at one Blow, divided his Head from his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
