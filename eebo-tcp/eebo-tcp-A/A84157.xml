            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

being called thereto, hath declared it freely to all people theſe 19. years', as you may ſee in his book
called <hi>[A Voice from Heaven,]</hi> Written in the year 1651. and directed to the Common-wealth of
<hi>England:</hi> as alſo the further preparation of God in him for the ſame purpoſe from his Nativitie to this time; And
the effects thereof you have fully ſet forth in his book called <hi>[An Eccho to the voice from Heaven, &amp;c.]</hi> Written
in the year 1652. In both which books is ſufficiently ſhewed Gods determination concerning this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Wealth.</p>
            <p>That, from the date of the ſaid books you may obſerve, how God hath in part fulfilled the words of your Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner,
and thereby conclude, God will fulfill the remainder thereof, ſo that, as ſure as the Parliament is diſſolved,
as ſure ſhall the <hi>King</hi> come to his <hi>Throne,</hi> as it is ſufficiently proved in the aforeſaid book. And indeed if your
Honours will looke into the ſame, and ſeriouſly reade and conſider them, you ſhall finde that your Petitioner
would not turn water into bloud, but would rather turn bloud into water, and water into wine, to cheriſh the
heart of the ſorrowfull, that the waters and tears of repentance might waſh away the guilt of bloud, and
become wine of conſolation to this Nation, in their union and conjunction with the KING.</p>
            <p>That without their conjunction to their Native and right KING, there is no hope of peace, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
or ſafety to this Nation, nor to your ſelves (moſt Noble Worthies) whoſe actions are glorious,
though as yet much imperfect: The great Mountain Parliament is become a plain before you: Next in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the KING is to be exalted by you, who is ſignified by the head-ſtone, <hi>Zachar.</hi> 4. 7.</p>
            <p>Crown all your actions by ſetting him up, and be glorious for ever: I am ſure, if you ſpeedily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
him KING, you will glorifie God thereby, and ſave an Ocean of <hi>Engliſh</hi> bloud from being ſpilt,
and have ſuch conditions of perfect peace from GOD and the KING, that you and your ſeed may be
his glorious Nobles for ever: Therefore, becauſe time is ſhort, uſe your Jewel for your beſt advantage, leaſt
you looſe it, as the Parliament did, for want of uſing it aright, according to the minde of God, and your
Petitioners inſtructions.</p>

Your <hi>Petitioner</hi> therefore humbly prayes, that your Honours would with

(Charles Stewart</hi> by Name) upon his Throne. Doe this and live for
