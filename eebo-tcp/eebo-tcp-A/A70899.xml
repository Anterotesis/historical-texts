            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

All <hi>Friday</hi> He was hot and Feavouriſh. On <hi>Saturday</hi> Morning, upon his loſing a little Blood, He thought himſelf better; but in the Evening his Feavour appearing more violent, a Bliſter was directed with ſuch other Remedies as were thought moſt proper, his Highneſs went this Day very often to Stool; this day a Raſh came out on his Skin, which increas'd the next, more Bliſters were laid on. On <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> in the Afternoon the Feavour growing ſtronger He went into a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirium, which laſted with his Life: He paſs'd this Night as he had done the preceeding, with ſhort broken Sleeps, and incoherent Talk. On <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> the Bliſters having taken effect, and the Pulſe mending, it was thought probable his Highneſs might recover. About Eleven at Night we were alarm'd with a ſudden change, and about two Hours after, Nature giving way to the Malignity of the Diſtemper, His Highneſs Expir'd.</p>

               <p>I came to wait on his Royal Highneſs <hi>July</hi> the 28<hi>th,</hi> being <hi>Sunday,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Three and Four in the Morning. I found him very Feavouriſh, with a quick and low Pulſe, and a crude Urine, and was inform'd by thoſe that attended him, that He had had ſeveral Stools that Afternoon. He ſwallow'd with eaſe, and when I look'd into his Throat, I ſound nothing amiſs there. About Eight the ſame Morning I found him in a Sweat, and Eruptions began to appear in his Skin, which towards the Afternoon increas'd, and at Night appear'd like a Raſh. About Three in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon He ſtrove to Vomit, and brought up a great deal of Veſci'd Phlegm, preſently after which He had a large Stool, and had like to have fainted

By the help of Alexipharmacal Medicines He continued in a Breathing Sweat, and the Raſh out, till about Eleven of the Clock laſt Night, when on the ſudden He was ſeiz'd with a difficult Breathing, and could ſwallow nothing down, and dy'd before Midnight.</p>

               </head>
               <p>ON <hi>Sunday</hi> the 28<hi>th.</hi> about Noon, I was ſent for to attend upon his Highneſs the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> at <hi>Winſor,</hi> I got thither about Six in the Evening, where I found his Highneſs in Bed with a very high Fever upon him, his Fleſh was extream hot, a high colour in his Cheeks, with ſeveral Eruptions upon his Skin and Face, attended with a Raſh; which gave ſome Suſpicion that it might prove the Small-Pox: His Pulſe was very quick and Fevoriſh; his Tongue White, and his ſwallowing without pain or difficulty; his Breathing by fits ſhort, and attended with great ſighing; his Urine Pale and without Sediment, and He himſelf very Reſtleſs and extream Light-headed. He had that day ſeveral Stools, and with the laſt ſo weaken'd, that He had like to have fainted away. After that I had inform'd my ſelf of the preſent Circumſtances and Condition of his Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, I retired with Dr. <hi>Gibbons,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hannes</hi> (who were both there) to conſult about his Recovery: We order'd him that Night a Drink, which was proper to ſuppreſs his Looſeneſs, which had it's effect, for He had no Stools afterwards. His Fever was a Malignant Fever in all its Symptoms, with a Raſh attending it: We order'd him Cordial-Powders and Cordial-Julips to reſiſt the Malignity; He took a Paper of thoſe Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that Night, which kept him in a Breathing Sweat, and brought out the Raſh in a greater quantity; He had but very little Reſt that Night with great ſighing and dejection of Spirits, and towards Morning complain'd very much of his Bliſters; they were open'd in the Morning, and they were drawn, and Run well; upon the Running of his Bliſters He was leſs Light-headed, and the Raſh came out more, ſo that towards Noon his Head was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably better, and his Breathing freer, which gave us ſome Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at that time to hope his Recovery: We order'd him in the Evening two more Bliſters, and to continue the Method He was in, hopeing, by the aſſiſtance of 'em, He would have a better Night, and be leſs Light-headed: But before the Bliſters could take place, the Malignity of the Diſtemper retreating from the Skin upon the Vital Parts, He was on a ſudden, after a little doſeing, taken with a ſort of Convulſive Breathing, with a defect in Swallowing, and a total Deprivation of all Senſe, which laſted about an Hour, and ſo between Twelve and One at Night he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted this Life.</p>
