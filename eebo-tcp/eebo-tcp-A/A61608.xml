            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen the <hi>Iewish Christians</hi> had form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselves into an established
<hi>Church,</hi> and were become consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
for their number as well
as for their zeal and devotion,
their obstinate Brethren thought
it high time for their own security, at least to
weaken and divide them, if they could not
wholly suppress and destroy them. For this
end, they made use of different instruments and
means, according to the different seasons, and
dispositions of men. Sometimes, when they
had any encouragement, or connivence from the
Roman Power, they set upon them with rage
and fury,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 32, 34.</note> 
               <hi>spoiling their goods,</hi> and threatning their
lives: But this hard uſage did only heighten the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95214:3"/>
courage, and unite the affections of the more
zealous Christians. Sometimes, they suggested
to them the mighty veneration, which their
whole Nation alwayes had for <hi>Moses</hi> and
the <hi>Law,</hi> and what an infinite scandal and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
it would be to them all, to have that Law,
which was delivered by Angels, confirmed
by Miracles, established by Prophets, admired by
the Gentiles, and had continued among them for
so many Ages, now of a sudden to be laid aside
for the sake of a new institution, that expressed
no more regard to them than to any other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the World. And so great was the love
which the <hi>Iews</hi> had to their own Countrey and
Religion, such an opinion was generally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
among them of the peculiar favour of God
towards them, that they who could not be shock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by persecution, were in danger of being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by flattery. From hence the <hi>Author</hi> of this
<hi>Epistle</hi> make it his business to shew the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of <hi>Christ</hi> above <hi>Moses,</hi> and of his <hi>institution</hi> above
that of the <hi>Law,</hi> in respect of the <hi>Priesthood</hi> and
<hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and <hi>the benefits</hi> which come by them;
and that although this <hi>new and living</hi> way were but
lately discovered, yet it was that which was
alwayes designed by God, foreseen by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs,
foretold by the Prophets, and longed
for by good men as <hi>the Consolution of Israel:</hi> and
it could be no more disparagement to <hi>Moses</hi> and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95214:3"/>
the <hi>Prophets</hi> to yield to the <hi>Glories</hi> of the Kingdom
of the <hi>Messias,</hi> than it is to the Stars not to be seen
when the light of the Sun appears. But besides
these, there were some among them capable of
being wrought upon by other kind of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
such I mean, who out of a sudden trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of zeal, and being convinced by the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
operations of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> had declared
themselves <hi>Christians,</hi> but yet retained a secret love
to their sins, and the pleasures of this World:
these were the Persons whom the <hi>Apostle,</hi> not
without reason, expresses the greatest jealousie
of, as in danger of Apostasie: and therefore in
many places of this Epistle, he represents to
them the dreadful consequences of such an
Apostasie,<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 6.</note> for it was no less than <hi>crucifying the
Son of God afresh and putting him to an open shame;
it was counting the blood of the Covenant wherewith they
were sanctified an unholy thing, and doing despight un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the spirit of Grace;</hi>
               <note place="margin">10. 20.</note> nay it was not only <hi>crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but treading under foot the Son of God;</hi> and
therefore he bids them consider, what punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
such persons would deserve <hi>at the hands
of God into which they must fall,</hi> and what
hopes there could be of pardon for those who
so openly rejected the only means of obtaining
it;<note place="margin">26. 27.</note> For <hi>if they did</hi> herein <hi>sin wilfully after they had
received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no
more sacrifice for sin, but a certain fearful looking for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95214:4"/>
of judgement, and fiery indignation which shall devour
the Adversaries.</hi> But he not only sets before them
the sad effects of Apostasie, but as one that loved
their souls, and designed to prevent their ruine,
he gives them the best advice and counsel against
it: He knew well enough, it was not the dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of mens reason, which was the ground
of their infidelity: but, as mens more open de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
are governed by such springs which are
least discovered; so, whatever these warping
Christians might pretend, as to zeal for the Law,
and their ancient Religion, the bottom of all
was a principle of infidelity, not arising from
want of sufficient reason to convince them, but
from a close and secret love of sin which made
them willing to quarrel with what ever was so
repugnant to it, as the doctrine of Christ. To
this end, he puts them in mind of the case of
their <hi>Fore-fathers</hi> in the Wilderness, who wanted
no arguments to convince them of Gods Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Providence; yet nothing would satisfie
them, but they were still murmuring and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining,<note place="margin">Heb. 3. 11.</note>
till at last <hi>God sware in his wrath that
they should not enter into his rest.</hi> 
               <q>And since you
all acknowledge, they had reason enough to
be satisfied, but out of an obstinate and stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
humour <hi>hardned their hearts in the day of
temptation in the Wilderness; take heed Brethren,</hi>
saith the Apostle,<note place="margin">12.</note> 
                  <hi>lest there be in any of you such
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95214:4"/>
an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living
God;</hi> and do not look upon this advice as vain
and needless to you that are called the <hi>believing
Iews,</hi> but you have cause to be very watchful
over one another, especially in this Tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Age, <hi>exhorting one another daily while it is
called to day, lest any of you be hardned through the
deceitfulness of sin.</hi>
               </q> As though he had said to
them, <q>You who now glory in the name of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,</hi>
and are hitherto as forward as any in
the profession of Christianity, do not think
your selves to be above the need of any helps
to confirm your faith, and to arm you against
the assaults of temptations, for your very se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
may betray you; but consider <hi>the sin
that doth so easily beset you</hi> on every side, the
various artifices it makes use of to deceive men,
and when it hath once gotten admission, how
strangely it bewitches and infatuates the
minds of men, how unwilling they are to
be convinced of their sins, how much more
unwilling to part with them, and how natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
the love of sin brings men to infidelity,
and then you will see how great reason there
is, why you should be <hi>exhorting one another daily
while it is called to day, lest any of you be hardned
through the deceitfulness of sin.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In which words, are these three things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:95214:5"/>
1. <hi>The</hi> danger <hi>they are in of</hi> being hardned through
the deceitfulness of sin, <hi>who have the most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
motives <hi>and</hi> engagements <hi>against it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The <hi>manner</hi> whereby <hi>sin</hi> doth prevail upon
men to harden them, <hi>through the Deceitfulness of sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>The</hi> care <hi>that all Christians ought to have
to prevent</hi> being hardned through the Deceitfulness of
sin: Lest any of you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Danger</hi> men are in <hi>of being hardned
through the deceitfulness of sin,</hi> though they have
the most powerful <hi>Motives</hi> and <hi>Engagements</hi> against
it. For never any Persons had greater argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
against returning to the practice of sin,
than these to whom this <hi>Epistle</hi> was written.
They had embraced among the first principles
of the doctrine of Christ,<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>the foundation of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
from dead works, and of faith towards God, of the
doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands</hi> (for the
miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghost) <hi>and of the
resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgement.</hi> And
what can we suppose to have greater force and
efficacy to restrain men from sin, than what is
contained in these fundamentals of Christianity?
But we shall find that no <hi>Motives</hi> have ever been
great enough to restrain those from sin, who have
secretly loved it, and only sought pretences for
the practice of it.</p>
            <p>Such is the frame and condition of humane
nature considered in it self, so great are the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95214:5"/>
advantages of reason and consideration for the
government of our actions, so much stronger are
the natural motives to vertue that to vice, that
they who look no farther, would expect to find the
world much better than it is. For why should we
suppose the generality of mankind to betray so
much folly, as to act unreasonably and against
the common interest of their own kind? as all
those do, that yield to the temptations of sin:
For if we set aside the consideration of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Law, <hi>to sin</hi> is nothing else but to act fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishly
and inconsiderately. But on the other
side, if men first look into the practice of the
World, and there observe the strange prevalency
of Vice, and how willing men are to defend as
well as to commit it; they would be apt to
imagine that either there is no such thing as
Reason among men, or that it hath very little
influence upon their actions; and that the talk
of Vertue was first found out by some great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to the Felicity of Mankind. Such different
apprehensions would men have from the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
wayes of beholding the Picture of Humane
nature; either as it is in its own frame, or as it is
to be seen in the World. They who have with
the greatest judgement and care searched into
the nature and first principles of humane Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
have all agreed that the chief end and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of men in joyning together was, for the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95214:6"/>
mutual benefit and advantage of each other; and
that in order to this, certain Laws of <hi>Iustice, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
Mercy, Truth, Gratitude, Temperance,</hi> as well as
of <hi>Subjection</hi> to <hi>Government,</hi> ought to be inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
observed by men. And since these things
have the universal consent of mankind to be for
their general good, how comes it to pass, that
men being joyned in these Societies for such
ends, make so little Conscience of the practice
of them? How come so many to live, as it were,
in open defiance to these Fundamental Laws of
Nature? How come others, only to make use
of the pretence of vertue to deceive, and of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty
and integrity to cover the deepest dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation?
If they be not good, why are they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended?
If they are good, why are they not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised?
So that whether we consider mankind
in it self, or in Society; we find the <hi>Motives</hi> to
vertue to be much more weighty, and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
than those to sin; and yet that the practice
of men is directly contrary.</p>
            <p>But it may be said, <hi>that all this might happen in
the world for want of wit and education to polish and
improve the natural Faculties of mens minds, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
and encourage the practice of vertue.</hi> I wish the
world had not so many instances that men of
the greatest wit have not been men of the best
Morals; but if wit, and education, and Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
had been the most effectual means to reclaim
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95214:6"/>
men from sin, where should we have looked
more for the flourishing of vertue, than in
<hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome?</hi> And yet in those times, when
all the accomplishments of <hi>wit</hi> were at the
highest in those places, the manners of men
were sunk into the greatest filth of debauchery.
It would make one astonished to read the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
discourses of their <hi>Philosophers,</hi> and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the strange height that <hi>eloquence</hi> and <hi>wit</hi>
were arrived to among their <hi>Orators</hi> and <hi>Poets;</hi>
and then to compare the account given of the
manners of the <hi>Gentile</hi> World, not only by their

It might be worth our while to consider how so
universal a degeneracy of manners should happen
in those ages, when men pretended more to Wit
and Learning, than they had done in any time
before. And for this, it were very unreasonable
to assign any Cause that were equally common
to all other Ages, such as the corruption of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
nature; which, how great soever it be, is
the same at all times; neither do I think it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
to lay it wholly on the bad examples
of the teachers of vertue, knowing how mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
the worst of men are in endeavouring to
make those who seem to be better, to be as bad
as themselves: but there are some peculiar rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
for it, and I wish they had been only proper
to those times: as,</p>
            <p>1. Separating <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Morality</hi> from each
other. When their <hi>Religion</hi> was placed in some
solemn Rites, and pompous Ceremonies, and
costly Sacrifices; but all the matters of <hi>Morality</hi>
were confined to their <hi>Schools,</hi> there to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
after by those that had leisure and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity
for them. As though God were more
concerned for the colour, and age, and pomp of
their Sacrifices, for the gestures and shews of
their devotion; than for the purity of their
hearts, the sincerity of their minds, or the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
of their lives. When once the people had
swallowed that pernicious principle, that Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95214:7"/>
was no part of their Religion, they had no
great regard to the good or evil of their actions,
as long as a little charge, and four looks, and going
to their Temples at certain times were thought
sufficient to expiate their sins. And they were much
more encouraged in Wickedness, when the Gods
they worshipped were represented on the stage as
acting all manner of villanies: and no doubt,
they thought it a great comfort to them in their
debaucheries, that their Gods were as <hi>good fellows</hi>
as themselves. And what could all the precepts
of <hi>Philosophers,</hi> or sayings of <hi>wise men</hi> signifie to
those who were so far from looking on vertue
as any necessary part of their Religion, that
they thought those fit to be worshipped for
Gods, whom they never believed to have been
good men?</p>
            <p>2. When they had thus rendred vertue unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
by making it no part of their Religion,
the next thing was to make it appear <hi>ridiculous;</hi>
which was a certain way to make <hi>Fools</hi> out of
love with it; who do not consider, what is fit to
be laughed at, but what is so. When <hi>Socrates</hi>
at <hi>Athens</hi> undertook with many sharp and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>Ironies</hi> to reprove the vices of his Age; and
with a great deal of Wit and Reason to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
men to the sober practice of Vertue, the
licentious people knew not what to do with him,
for they were not able to withstand the force of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95214:8"/>
his arguments; at last <hi>Aristophanes</hi> (having a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
Wit</hi> whereby he was able to make any thing
seem ridiculous although he knew very well
the <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Learning</hi> of <hi>Socrates;</hi> yet) to please
and humour the people, he brings him upon the
Stage, and represents his grave instructions af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
such a manner, as turn'd all into a matter of
laughter to the people of <hi>Athens:</hi> which did
more mischief to the reputation of <hi>Vertue</hi> among
them, than the taking away his life did. For,
his dying convinced the people he was in good
earnest, and brought a great veneration to his
memory; whereas the other exposed him only
to scorn and contempt; and the people were
made judges whether it were with cause or no:
who besides their ignorance and want of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
were too much parties to be Judges.
This is the method which men take, when they
set their <hi>wits</hi> against <hi>vertue</hi> and <hi>Goodness;</hi> they know
it is impossible to argue men out of it; but it is
very easie by ridiculous postures, and mimical
gestures, and profane similitudes, to put so grave
and modest a thing as <hi>vertue</hi> is out of Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
among those who are sure to laugh on
the other side. I do not think such things can
signifie any thing to Wise men; but when
was the world made up of such? and therefore
it signifies very much to the mischief of those,
who have not the <hi>courage</hi> to love <hi>despised vertue;</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:95214:8"/>
nor to defend a Cause that is <hi>laughed down.</hi> And
to these I may now add,</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>bad examples</hi> of others, especially of
those to whom it belonged to <hi>teach and encourage
vertue,</hi> above others. No man will pretend, that
it is ground enough for him to do a thing meerly
because he sees another do it; yet in all Ages men
have seen and complained that the power of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
hath outdone that of Laws. Some that
think themselves more subtle than others, questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whether those mean what they say, who speak
one thing and do another; and therefore they
will do what they think the others mean; which
were a good plea if their actions were better than
their words. Others think, that all discourses
of vertue, and honesty, and true Honour, are
meer matter of talk for men to entertain some
idle hours with, and that men are universally
agreed in nothing but in speaking well and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ill. These look on vertue as a kind of <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix,</hi>
a thing often talked of, and believed by some,
but never seen by any: but such find all things
so very bad at home, that out of charity to
themselves, they believe the whole World to be
like them. Others have so much natural mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
and sense of shame that they have not the
courage to commit a great wickedness, unless
they were hardned to it by the example of
greater sinners before them. But the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95214:9"/>
reason of the prevalency of example is,
that men find in themselves a strong propensity
and inclination to do evil, and are willing to
meet with such a pretence for committing it, that
they do but as others do; and therefore I cannot
think that bare example were enough to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
the World if there were not some antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
inclination in humane nature to the practice
of evil. For since there is less reason to follow
bad examples than good, why should one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
more than the other in the World, if there
were nothing but the bare example to move?
But that inclination being considered, we may
easily give an account of the ill consequence
which the bad examples of those who are to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
and encourage others in vertue, must needs
be of to the rest of mankind.<note place="margin">Xen. ep. ad Aesch.</note> 
               <hi>Xenophon</hi> was not
without reason so much displeased, when he
saw some of the best of <hi>Socrates</hi> his Disciples,
make their <hi>Court</hi> to <hi>Dionysius</hi> in <hi>Sicilie;</hi> knowing
how inconsistent the reputation of vertue is, with
the very <hi>suspicion</hi> of <hi>Flattery:</hi> and that nothing
makes great men more suspicious of <hi>vertue,</hi>
than when they see <hi>Philosophers</hi> become <hi>Flatterers,</hi>
and carrying on the restless designs of ambition
under the pretence of teaching the art of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
to others. It was this which made the
very name of them become so odious at <hi>Rome,</hi>
that even vertue it self was hated for their sakes:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95214:9"/>
so that the very teachers of vertue contributed to
the increase of vice. Especially, when by their end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
disputes &amp; wranglings about words &amp; terms
of art, they made the people suspect they did but
play prizes before them; and only pretended to
quarrel, but were well enough agreed to cheat and
deceive them. Upon such grounds as these, all
the <hi>Motives</hi> to <hi>vertue</hi> contained in the <hi>Writings</hi> and
<hi>instructions</hi> of <hi>Philosophers</hi> lost their due force and
efficacy on the minds of the people, who were
rather more <hi>hardned in their sins</hi> by these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages
which attended the means that were
used to reclaim them from the practice of
them.</p>
            <p>But when all other <hi>motives</hi> proved ineffectual
by these disadvantages, what could be more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
expected, than that the <hi>motives</hi> of the
<hi>Gospel</hi> should prevail with men, being of so great
weight in themselves, and recommended with
so much advantage to the World, by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of those who delivered them? The great
arguments of Christianity against the practice
of sin are not drawn from any uncertain <hi>Topicks,</hi>
or nice and curious speculations; but from the
influence mens good or evil actions in this World
will have upon their happiness or misery in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And what concerns another state is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
with much more clearness, and confirmed
by stronger evidence, and enforced by more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95214:10"/>
considerations, than ever it was before
among the best and wisest of the Gentiles. The
doctrine of Christianity is plain and perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in this matter,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 6. 1. 18.</note> 
               <hi>that God will render to every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Works:</hi> and <hi>that the wrath of God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of men.</hi> And however prone men <hi>are to
be deceived with vain words,</hi> yet let them look to
themselves,<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 7.</note> 
               <hi>God will not be mocked,</hi> (however men
may be) <hi>for because of these things the wrath of God
will come upon the Children of disobedience.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 6.</note> No Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
no prayers, no penances, no vows and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
will keep off this wrath of God without a
hearty repentance and timely reformation. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any Religion or institution in the World
made it so much its business to keep men from
doing evil, and to perswade them to do good, as
the Christian doth. The Apostles thought it the
greatest contradiction to their profession, for any
men to be called Christians, and to live in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of their former sins,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Let the time past of your
life suffice you,</hi> saith S. <hi>Peter, to have wrought the will
of the Gentiles,</hi> i. e. that time past when you were
no Christians. To be a Christian then was all
one as of a loose, profane, dissolute person to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
sober, religious, exact in his conversation
<hi>To put on Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 14.</note> was but another phrase, <hi>for making
no provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof; To learn
Christ,</hi> was all one as <hi>to put off as concerning the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95214:10"/>
conversation the old man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 20, 21, 24.</note> 
               <hi>which is corrupt according to
the deceitful lusts; and to put on the new man, which after
God is created in righteousness and true holiness.</hi> Those
were the blessed dayes of Christianity, when it
was no hard matter to understand what it was to
be a Christian; when the niceties of disputes,
and the subtle artifices of men of corrupt minds
had not yet debauched the notion of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to reconcile it with the lusts of men. To
be a Christian then, was not to be versed in the
subtilties of the Schools; or to be able to swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
contradictions without chewing them; or
to be as fierce and earnest for every doubtful opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and uncertain custome, as if the substance
of Christianity were like <hi>Epicurus</hi> his World
made up of a great number of very small and
restless Atomes. To be a Christian, was not
to fight for the Faith, but to live by it; not to
quarrel for good Works, but to practise them;
In short, to be a Christian was <hi>to depart from iniquity
and to do good,</hi> to be meek, and humble, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
and peaceable towards all men; to be
charitable, and kind; to be sober and <hi>temperate in
all things,</hi> to be holy, sincere, and innocent in his
actions towards God and men. This is the true
<hi>Idea</hi> of a Christian, and not a meer <hi>Idea;</hi> but such
as every one that owns himself to be a Christian
is bound by the most Sacred vow of <hi>Christianity</hi>
in <hi>Baptism</hi> to be like; so that if either the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95214:11"/>
of their own eternal welfare, or the
nature, design, or honour of Christianity, or
their own most solemn engagements can restrain
men from the practice of sin, we see that those
who are Christians, are under the most powerful
<hi>motives</hi> and <hi>engagements</hi> against it.</p>
            <p>But yet such there have been (I wish I could
not say such there are) who have broken through
all these things, and <hi>have been hardned through the
deceitfulness of sin.</hi> One might have thought, if
any persons had been out of this danger, they
had been such as the <hi>Apostle</hi> makes this exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to; who had seen the <hi>miraculous operations of
the Holy Ghost for</hi> confirming the <hi>doctrine</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi>
of <hi>Christianity;</hi> nay who had themselves been
<hi>made partakers of the Holy Ghost,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>and had tasted of this
Heavenly gift, and of the good word of God, and of the
powers of the world to come:</hi> Who had testified their
repentance for their former sins in the most pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
and solemn manner, and had entred into the
most Sacred Vow of Baptism, never to return
more to the practice of it: who had done this
in the heat of persecution, which they endured
with courage and rejoycing; yet after all these
things, the Apostle expresses a more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
jealousie lest any of them <hi>should fall away,</hi>
and <hi>their hearts be hardned through the deceitfulness of
sin.</hi> When <hi>Critias</hi> and <hi>Alcibiades</hi> had forsaken the
paths of vertue, which they seemed very forward
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95214:11"/>
in, while they continued under the instructions of
<hi>Socrates,</hi>

               <hi>Xenophon</hi> saith, <hi>there were some that contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that they never had any vertue at all, because
those who once had it could never lose it: but for his
part,</hi> he saith, <hi>he was by no means satisfied with their
opinion: for as men by discontinuing bodily exercises
make themselves uncapable of doing those things which they
were most expert in before; so men by the neglect of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
their minds in vertue; and giving way to the
temptations of honour and pleasure</hi> (which was the
case of <hi>Critias</hi> and <hi>Alcibiades) may by degrees lose the
force of all the Motives to vertue and consequently the
vertue it self.</hi> It is agreed by all men who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
any thing in these matters, that even
<hi>Grace,</hi> although it be the effect of a divine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
on the minds of men, is of it self capable of
being lost; the great dispute is, whether it may
be lost past all recovery? But as <hi>we</hi> have no
more reason to set any bounds to the Grace of
God in mens Recovery, than as to their first Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
so we ought to consider, that there is
such <hi>a falling away</hi> mentioned by the <hi>Apostle,</hi> of
<hi>those who have been once enlightned,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 4, 6.</note> 
               <hi>of which,</hi> he saith,
<hi>it is impossible to renew them again to repentance:</hi> and
that Scripture deals with all persons in its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations,
and adomonitions, and threatnings,
as if they were capable of falling to the utmost
degree: and to suppose that thing impossible to
be done, which the gravest counsels, and the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95214:12"/>
most vehement perswasions are used to keep
men from the doing of, is to make a severe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
on the wisdom of them that give them.
And the <hi>Apostle</hi> here leaves none of them out;
but bids the most <hi>forward believers</hi> beware of an
<hi>evil heart of unbelief;</hi> and those who had been
most softned by repentance, take heed of <hi>being
hardned through the deceitfulness of sin.</hi> So that we
see, how powerful soever the <hi>motives</hi> to <hi>Vertue</hi>
are; how great soever the <hi>engagements</hi> against <hi>Sin;</hi>
yet the <hi>Apostle</hi> thought it needful to give them
warning against the <hi>deceitfulness of sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. But what kind of <hi>deceitfulness</hi> is this in sin, that
the best and wisest men are so much caution'd
against it? What irresistible <hi>charms</hi> doth it use to
draw men into its snares? with what infusion
doth it so far intoxicate mankind to make them
dote upon it, against the convictions of Reason,
and dictates of Conscience, and the power of
perswasion, and the most solemn and repeated
Vows and Promises against it? nay to make men
pursue it, to such a degree as rather to be
damned for it than forsake it? If we were to
consider this only by Reason, we could imagine
nothing less than that <hi>sin</hi> at one time or other
hath laid such a mighty obligation on mankind,
that rather than part with it, the greater part of
men, out of meer gratitude, would be content
to suffer for ever with it: or, that it is a thing so
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95214:12"/>
absolutely necessary to the comfort of mens
lives, that they cannot live one good day without
it: Whereas in truth, the whole race of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
hath suffered extreamly and continually by
it: and it is so far from being necessary to the
comfort of mens lives, that the greatest troubles
and vexations of life have risen from it; and
men may enjoy far greater satisfaction, and more
real contentment; and more noble, and solid,
and lasting pleasures if they did utterly renounce
and forsake it. But this still makes the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
so much the greater, how it should so far
be witch and infatuate the far greatest part of
mankind; and of those who know how dearly
they must suffer for it in another World? And
yet to assoil this difficulty, we have only two
Accounts to give how sin comes to deceive
mankind so generally, so fatally; and those are
1. By subtle insinuations; 2. By false rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>By subtle insinuations.</hi> The great Masters
of pleading in ancient times have told us, that
there are some Causes which are never to be
managed by plain and downright reasonings,
(because they are too weak to bear that method
of handling) and then they bid men have a
care in their beginning, of coming close to
the business; but they must fetch a compass
about, and by secret arts and degrees insinuate
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95214:13"/>
themselves into the good opinion of the Judges
before they are aware of it. This is the very
method which is made use of <hi>by the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Sin;</hi> it dares not stand the examination of
any close reasoning, for all its artifices would
presently be discover'd then; but it makes use of
these arts of insinuation. 1. It endeavours to
raise a good opinion of it self by false colours
and representations of things. 2. When it hath
done that, it draws men on by degrees to the
practice of it. 3. When men are engaged in the
practice of sin, then it represents to them how
much it is their own interest to defend it, and so
brings them from <hi>the counsel of the ungodly, and the
way of sinners, to the seat of the scornful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. It endeavours to raise a good opinion of
it self by <hi>false colours</hi> and representations of
things. The first precept of insinuation is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
prejudice; for while that continues, all
that can be said will be of no force. While
men look on sin as vile, and loathsome; as mean
and unworthy of a man; as inconsistent with the
peace and contentment of their minds, so long
temptations are easily resisted: all arts must
therefore be used to make it appear with all the
address and flattery which is most apt to entice
a poor deluded sinner. Then, the fetters and
shackles which it brings to enslave men with,
must be looked on and admired as ornaments;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95214:13"/>
its most sordid and filthy pleasures must be
thought great and manly; and a little present
honour and advantage appear more valuable
than an eternal state of Happiness and Glory.
These are things we should think it very hard
for men to be deceived with; and yet every
day we find they are so; and which is far more,
they are ready to take it very ill of those who
go about to undeceive them. In other cases, if
a man tells another, that he is like to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
with a false and counterfeit Jewel instead
of a true one; or to buy a bad Title to an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
instead of a good one, he thinks himself
very much obliged to him for his fidelity and
kindness; only in the case of mans beloved
sins, although they will prove the greatest
cheats in the World to him, yet he cannot well
endure to be told so; but his blood is apt to
fire and enflame him into a passion against him
that doth it; and although it be meant with
the greatest innocency and kindness, it is ready
to be interpreted to be only the effect of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and ill will. For now sin hath insinuated
it self so far into him, that no one can be
thought a friend to the person, who is not so to
his sins; and they are then come to that height
of friendship and community of interests, to
have common friends and common enemies.
Now all the discourses of the freedom, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95214:14"/>
pleasure, and satisfaction of a mans mind in the
practice of vertue appear very dull and insipid
things; and fit only for <hi>Learned Fools</hi> or <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi>
to talk of.</p>
            <p>Nothing deserves the name of <hi>Liberty</hi> with
them, but a power of doing what they please.
What nonsense and contradiction doth it seem
to them for those to be accounted free, who are
under any bonds or restraints? No matter to
them, whether they be from God, or Nature,
from Reason or Conscience, as long as they
are restraints, they look on them as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with their notion of liberty. And
next to those who threaten men with pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
in another World for what they do
amiss in this, they account those the greatest
Fools that first found out the distinction of good
and evil, and just and unjust in the actions of
men, <q>What Fools (say they) were they to
fasten dishonourable and reproachful names on
some of the most pleasant and beneficial acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of life? For thus a man is debarred that
noble and manly Vice of Drunkenness for fear
of losing the reputation of Sobriety; and the
extravagancies of Lust, for fear of doing inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to his neighbours Bed; and supposing a
man hath never so much advantages in his
hands to enrich himself by defrauding ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
yet he must not do it, because although
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95214:14"/>
an estate be in the keeping of a Fool, yet
another must not be a Knave to get it from him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus do these miserable Slaves to Vice pitty the
weakness of those who have so little wit (as they
think) not to understand the Liberty they enjoy:
But thus do mad men pitty the dulness of those
that are in their wits, that do not sing, and rant,
and despise the World, as they do: and fancy
themselves to be Kings and Princes, while they
are tyed fast in their chains, and lye in Straw.
And upon such grounds as these, the most rude
and barbarous <hi>Indians</hi> did better understand the
liberty of mankind, than the most civilized Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
For all civility is a debarring men of
some part of this natural liberty, <hi>i. e.</hi> of those
things which men have a power to do; and
upon this ground all antient Law-givers and
Wise men, who by degrees brought several Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to Order and Government, and to live by
Laws, ought to be hated as the greatest Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
and Usurpers upon the liberties of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:
and the natural consequence of this
would be the overthrow of all Laws, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and Government in the World. But if
there must be some restraints upon men, then
we are to consider what restraints are just and
reasonable, within whose bounds we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
our selves; and whatever tends to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
of God, to the injury of others, or to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95214:15"/>
our own destruction, it is all the reason in the
World we should abstain from. And if men
would but do this, they would be kept from the
practice of sin: And so this imaginary noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a boundless <hi>liberty</hi> will appear to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one of the <hi>false colours</hi> that sin puts upon evil
actions, on purpose to tempt men to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of them.</p>
            <p>But there is another Poison which more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly
and dangerously insinuates it self into the
hearts of men, and by which sin gets the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
there, and that is the <hi>love</hi> of <hi>pleasure;</hi>
I do not mean the pleasure of the mind, or the
pleasure of a good conscience, for there is no
danger in these; but it is the love of sensual
pleasure which is most apt to ensnare men in
the practice of sin. It is under this representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
chiefly, that sin deceives, betrayes, entangles,
bewitches, destroyes the souls of men: It is this
which fills the imagination, and darkens the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
with filthy steams and vapours,
and hurries a man on with the impetuous vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of passions, without considering the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
consequence which attends it, either as
to his honour in this World, or his salvation in
another.<note place="margin">

of sin was well represented in one of the
<hi>Eastern Parables, of a man violently pursued by Wild
Beasts to the top of a Precipice, where there was a Tree
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95214:15"/>
growing on the side of a great lake, and at the foot of
it a prodigious Serpent lying ready to devour him; the
man being in this astonishment gets upon the first branch
of the tree he could reach; but he was no sooner there,
but his horrour increased at the apprehension of his
danger on every side of him; and that which added the
most to his consternation was that the very branch on
which he stood was almost eaten off; while he was in
this terrible fright, he looks up to the top of the tree, and
there sees some wild honey trickling down the body of
the tree, which he was so taken with, and so pleased
with the sweetness of it, that he forgets his danger,
till of a sudden the branch breaks, and down he drops
into the lake without recovery.</hi> This is the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
of the pleasures of sin, which men
are so much entertained with, that they never
consider the hazard they run, and scarce think
of their danger till they drop into that state of
misery from whence there is no redemption.</p>
            <p>But besides these soft and voluptuous sinners,
(who are easily deceived and hardly drawn out
of the snares they fall into) there are others of
a more busie, restless, and designing temper, and
to these sin appears under another shape to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them, with all the advantages of external
Splendour and Greatness. And thus they who
possibly might escape the baits of pleasure, are
carryed away by the more plausible temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Riches and Honour. It is supposed by
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95214:16"/>
some, that when the Devil tempted Christ
with the offers of <hi>the Kingdoms of this world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 4. 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>if he
would fall down and worship him,</hi> he did not
know, who he was, but had a mind to try him
by the most probable way of discovering what
was within him: But surely the Devil thought
him some extraordinary person, or else he
would never have made so large an offer at
first, <hi>viz.</hi> of no less <hi>than all the Kingdoms of the
World,</hi> whereas very much less than one of these
hath served to corrupt and debauch the minds of
many who have been great pretenders to Piety
and Vertue. It was indeed somewhat a hard
condition the Devil joyned with his offer, <hi>to fall
down and Worship him,</hi> because he then design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not only a Victory but a Triumph; but with
others he conceals the condition and draws them
on by degrees, still rising higher and higher in his
temptations, thereby feeding and enlarging their
desires; till the love of this World hath gotten
such an entire possession of their hearts, that
they scarce ever in good earnest think of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
till their souls are passing into it. And then
it may be, they sadly reflect on their own folly, in
that they have preferred the deluding scenes and
pompous shews of worldly greatness, before the
compleat and endless felicity of another life.
But it very often happens, that it is not so long,
as till their leaving this World, that men come
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95214:16"/>
to understand the restless folly of ambition.
For the things of this World are like <hi>Epicurus</hi> his
<hi>Atoms,</hi> alwayes moving and justling one against
another; and one mans ambition serves to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant
anothers, and they who cannot raise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
may yet help to ruine others; and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
those very designs by which they most
hoped to advance themselves, prove the occasion
of their fall and destruction. The <hi>Mahumetans</hi>
have a story to this purpose;<note place="margin">Warn. Prov. Persic. p. 33.</note> 
               <hi>In the time of Iesus
three men in a journey hapned to find a Treasure; but
being hungry, they sent one of their number to buy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions;
he consults how he might get this treasure to
himself, and for that end resolves to poison their meat,
the other two agreed to share it between them, and to
kill the third assoon as he returned; which they did, and
themselves soon after dyed of the poisoned meat. Iesus
passing by with his disciples, said, This is the condition
of this world! see what the love of it hath brought these
men to! Wo be to him that looks for any other usage
from it.</hi> This is the first way whereby sin doth
insinuate into the minds of them; <hi>viz.</hi> by
false colours and representations of things.</p>
            <p>2. But when sin hath so far insinuated it self
to bring men to a better opinion of it, it doth not
presently hurry them on to the greatest height
of wickedness; but leads them gently and by
easie steps and degrees, lest they should start
back presently with the fright of some dreadful
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95214:17"/>
sin. Which will appear if we consider, how one
comes to be corrupted by sin that hath had the
advantage of a modest and vertuous education:
if those who design to debauch him speak out at
first in plain words what they aim at, a sudden
horrour seizes upon him at the apprehension
of it, and it may be he hates their company for
ever after. But there is so much a sense of
shame left in humane nature, that men dare not
tempt others to sin, at least at first, in plain terms;
and the same temptation which being represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
one way would affright, appearing with
greater art and dissimulation may easily prevail.
And sin is a thing, that men hate to be forced,
but too much love to be cheated into the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of it. How doth a young sinner struggle
with himself, and would if it were possible get
out of the noise of his own Conscience, when
he hath offered force and violence to it! He is
very uneasie to himself, and wisheth a thousand
times he had never committed the sin, rather
than to feel such horrour and disquiet in his
mind, upon the sense of it. But if this doth not
make him presently repent, and resolve never
to be guilty again of the same folly, (as in all
reason it ought to do) then by time and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
he wears off the impression of his guilt,
and the next occasion of sinning makes him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
the wounds of his Conscience, and the smart
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95214:17"/>
he endured before; and the fresh temptation
revives the sense of his former pleasure, and
then he is able to withstand no longer; and
thus by repeating the same acts, by degrees he
becomes a very hopeful sinner, and the reports
of his Conscience are but like that of sounds at
a greater distance; they lessen still more and
more, till at last they cannot be heard at all.
And when he hath thus mastered his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
as to any one sin, which at first he was
fearful of committing, and hath found
such an <hi>Ice</hi> upon his Conscience as will bear
him, he goes on still farther and farther, till no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
be too hard for him. He that at first
started and trembled at the hearing of an horrid
oath, now can hear whole volleys of them dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
without shrinking; and can bear his
part in that hellish <hi>Concert:</hi> and he that was so
hardly brought to be wicked himself, may in a
little time (as some men are strange proficients
in wickedness) tempt and encourage others to
the practice of it.</p>
            <p>3. And when men are arrived to an habitual
continuance in sin, then for their present ease and
security, they cast about for any wayes to defend
it. For whatever is become of Conscience, they
may have such a sense of reputation left, that
they would not be thought <hi>Fools,</hi> and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
and despised by others. But although
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95214:18"/>
it be impossible for such to avoid scorn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
among all those who have any true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to Vertue or Honour, yet they will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
rather to defend themselves in doing ill,
than recover their reputation by repentance.
And because it would puzzle the wits of the
most subtle and concerned persons to find out
pretences and excuses for some kinds of sins;
therefore the easiest way is to represent all the
World as alike bad, although not alike cunning;
and although it may be not in the same way, yet
in something as ill in it self, but more agreeable
to their Age, temper, and condition of life.
Thus the greatest sinners love to herd themselves
in a croud, and think it some poor defence for
their sins, that they would have others believed
to be as bad as they: as though a man were in
the less danger by the plague, because it is a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
contagion. But if it happen that some persons
in the World should have any reputation for Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
among them, then all the weaknesses, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discretions
of such, are sure to be enquired after,
that so what is accounted vertue, may be thought
only natural sourness of temper, or want of wit
to be otherwise. But if any such should be
found in a miscarriage, what Joy and Triumph
doth this make? what load of circumstances
and aggravations do they lay upon them; as
though one single miscarriage of such persons
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95214:18"/>
were to weigh down a thousand enormities of
theirs. And because it is impossible to defend
their extravagant courses by <hi>Reason,</hi> the only
way left for them is to make <hi>Satyrical Invectives</hi>
against <hi>Reason;</hi> as though it were the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,
foolish and (I had almost said) <hi>unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable</hi>
thing in the World: and yet they pretend
to shew it in arguing against it: but it is pitty
such had not their wish, <hi>to have been Beasts rather
than men,</hi> (if any men can make such a <hi>wish</hi> that
have it not already) that they might have been
less capable of doing mischief among mankind;
by representing all the excellencies of humane
nature, which are <hi>Reason,</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> and <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
but as more grave and solemn fopperies.
But how hard are such men put to defend their
vices, that cannot do it, without trampling un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
foot the most noble perfections of their own
nature!</p>
            <p>These however are the more ingenuous sort
of sinners, that yield <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> to be of
<hi>Vertues</hi> side; but there are others that make use
of some shallow pretences of <hi>Reason</hi> to excuse
themselves in their sins: which is the second way
whereby sin deceives men, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>By false Reasonings:</hi> and those taken either,
1. From their Present impunity: 2. Or from
their Future Repentance.</p>
            <p>1. From their <hi>present impunity</hi> in sinning, men
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95214:19"/>
are apt to deceive themselves into a continuance
in it. This is the account the Wise man hath
long since given of mens being hardned in sin;<note place="margin">Eccl. 8. 11.</note>
               <hi>Because sentence against an evil work is not executed
speedily; therefore the hearts of the sons of men is fully
set in them to do evil.</hi> It seems somewhat hard to
understand the consequence, why men should
grow more desperately wicked, because God
gives them a space to repent? Is it necessary that
if God doth punish at all, he must do it present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?
that would seem to be rage and fury, or a
necessity of nature, and not justice. Cannot
judgement be duly executed, unless the Judge
break open the Prison doors, and torment the
Malefactor in his chains? Why may not God
respite the punishment of sinners, when he
pleases, to another state, since he hath declared
<hi>that he hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the
World in righteousness?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 17. 31.</note> What incongruity is there
in this to any principle of reason or justice?
Will not this time of Gods patience, be a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
vindication of his lenity and goodness in
order to the drawing men to repentance? And
will not the day of his future judgement be a
full vindication of his justice? Will not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable
honours of a miserable eternity dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
far more Gods abhorrence of sin, than pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
sufferings in this life, which, the greater
they are, the less they continue? But all this
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95214:19"/>
false way of reasoning ariseth from that gross
piece of self-flattery that such do imagine God
to be like themselves; <hi>i. e.</hi> as cruel and revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
as they are: and they presently think, if any
persons did offend them at the rate that sinners
are said to offend God, and they had so much
power in their hands to punish them as he has,
without any fear of revenge upon themselves,
they would be sure to dispatch them presently;
but because they see God doth it not, therefore
they conclude that all the talk of Gods anger and
hatred against sin is without ground: and from
hence they take encouragement to sin. So the
Psalmist saith in Gods name,<note place="margin">Psal. 50. 21.</note> 
               <hi>These things thou didst
and I kept silence;</hi> and they presently took his
<hi>silence</hi> for <hi>consent;</hi> for it follows, and <hi>thou thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
that I was altogether such a one as thy self:</hi> but
the Psalmist adds, how ill he took this at mens
hands, and that he would one day make them
know the difference between the forbearance of
sinners, and the love of their sins; <hi>but I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
thee, and set them in order before thee.</hi> And
therefore he bids them be better advised, and
<hi>consider this while they forget God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 22.</note> 
               <hi>lest he tear them in
pieces, and there be none to deliver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Men are hardned by the deceitfulness of
sin, from the hopes of their <hi>future repentance.</hi>
For that is one of the great cheats of sin, that
every one thinks he can repent and shake off
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95214:20"/>
his sins when he hath a mind to do it. Sin
doth not lye like a heavy weight upon their
backs, so that they feel the load of it; and
therefore they think it is easily removed, if
they would set themselves to it. Most of those
that believe a God and a judgement to come,
and yet continue in sin, do it upon this presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
that one time or other, they shall leave
their sins, and change the course of their lives
before they go out of this world. They have
not only thoughts of repentance, but general
purposes of doing the acts of it at one time, or
other; but that time is not come, and God
knows whether it ever will or no. For sin en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices
them and draws them on still; and when
any motions towards repentance come into their
minds, that presently suggests, <hi>It is time enough yet;
why so much haste? there will be trouble enough in it
when you must do it, what need you bring it so fast
upon you? Are not you likely to hold out a great many
years yet? what pitty it is to lose so much of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of life, while you are capable of enjoying it? There
is old Age coming, and when you will be good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else, then will be time enough to grow wise and
to repent.</hi> But O foolish sinner, who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched
thee to hearken to such unreasonable
suggestions as these are! For</p>
            <p>3. In the last place, it ought to be our present,
our constant, our greatest care to prevent being
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95214:20"/>
               <hi>hardned by the deceitfulness of sin.</hi> For to this end,
it is not enough to consider of it at one time
or other in our lives, but we must be <hi>exhorting
one another daily, while it is called to day, lest any of us
be hardned through the witchcraft and deceitfulness of
sin:</hi> And if it be so much the duty of others to
shew that regard to one anothers souls; how
much more doth it become us to do it, who
expect to be called to an account at the great day
for the discharge of our trust in this matter?
It is a dreadful passage we read of in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
Ezekiel,</hi> and enough to make our ears to tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
at the repeating it,<note place="margin">Ezek. 33. 8.</note> 
               <hi>When I say unto the wicked,
O wicked man thou shalt surely dye, if thou dost not
speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked
man shall dye in his iniquity, but his blood will I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
at thine hand.</hi> We would fain believe this
to have been some particular and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
commission given to the Prophet by God
himself, which doth not concern us; for what
will become of us, if not only our own faults
(which God knows are too many) but other
mens shall be charged upon us? when either
through neglect, or flattery, or fear of displeasing,
or for any mean and unworthy ends, we betray
our trust, and instead of preventing prove the
occasion of mens being too much <hi>hardned through
the deceitfulness of sin.</hi> But although we neither
pretend to be <hi>Prophets,</hi> nor <hi>Apostles,</hi> yet it is
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95214:21"/>
our Office to take care of the <hi>Souls</hi> of men, and
can we discharge that, as we ought to do, if we
do not with all faithfulness warn men of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
they run into <hi>through the deceitfulness of sin?</hi>
It were happy for us if we could say, <hi>that all the
Lords people are holy;</hi> for then we should have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to do, but to praise and commend their
Vertues, which were an easie and a delightful
task: but what pleasure is it to rake into the
sores, or to reprove the Vices of a degenerate
age? to be thought troublesome and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
if we do our duty; and men of no consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
if we do it not? But our work is neither
to libel our Auditors, nor to flatter them; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to represent them as better, nor worse than
they are; nor to charge them with more guilt
than their own consciences do charge them
with: but our business is, to beseech and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
them by the mercies of God, by the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
of Christ, by the love and tenderness they
have for their immortal souls, that they <hi>would to
day, while it is called to day, take heed lest they be
hardned through the deceitfulness of sin.</hi> And that
will appear to be very reasonable on these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations.</p>
            <p>1. That none are out of the danger of it, while
they live in this tempting World. What need
have we to take care of being deceived by that,
which hath been too hard for the <hi>best,</hi> the <hi>wisest,</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:95214:21"/>
and the <hi>greatest</hi> of men? Man in his best state,
even that of Innocency, was deceived by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuations
of sin: when there was no matter
within for the temptation to work upon, no
reason suggested that could move a common un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
no interest or advantage that could
sway him; no other moving cause appears to
us of that fatal Apostasie of <hi>Adam,</hi> but either the
imagination of some unknown pleasure, or the
bare curiosity of trying an experiment what the
effects would be of tasting <hi>the forbidden fruit.</hi>
And ever since so general hath the corruption
of mankind been, so successful have the artifices
and deceits of sin been in the World, that the
best of men have not wholly escaped them; but
have sometimes fallen in those very Graces
which have been most remarkable in them, as
<hi>Abraham</hi> in his trust in God, <hi>Moses</hi> in his meekness,
<hi>Iob</hi> in his patience, <hi>Peter</hi> in his zeal for Christ.
What cause then have others to look to themselvs!</p>
            <p>If wisdom and experience would have se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
men, we should have thought, of all
men in the World, <hi>Solomon</hi> the least in danger
of being deceived by the insinuations of sin,
who had given such excellent cautions against
those very snares he fell into himself; and that
to such a degree, that his case is left disputable
to this day, whether he ever recovered by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
or no. What numbers are there upon
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95214:22"/>
record of those mighty men, who have made
the earth to tremble at the noise of their Armies;
who have led Kings in chains after their Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal
Chariots, and have been served by those
whom others have adored; yet have, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all this, been enslaved themselves by
some mean lust, and destroyed by the power of
an effeminate passion? What can be strong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to resist those charms, which neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,
nor wisdom, nor power are sufficient
security against? Nothing, but the <hi>Grace of God,</hi>
and continual care of our selves.</p>
            <p>2. The less men suspect their danger, the
more cause they have to be afraid of it. None
are more fatally deceived by sin, than those who
apprehend no danger in it, or think they can
escape it when they please. How strangely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuated
are those through <hi>the deceitfulness of sin,</hi>
who think with themselves, that after they have
spent their lives in sin, they shall make God
amends by a few dying groans, and such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
as can have <hi>no amendment of life?</hi> Most
men, who are the greatest slaves to their sins,
are so much deceived by them, as to think they
have them wholly at their command, and can
when they please cast them off: and such ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
keep them faster in subjection to
them. For if they did apprehend themselves
under such slavery, as really they are, they
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95214:22"/>
would grow weary and impatient of the yoak;
whereas now because they are not forced to
commit their sins, they suppose they can with
ease forsake them. But none are such incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Fools, as they that think themselves Wise;
and none are so miserably deceived as they that
think themselves too cunning for their sins. If
it be so easie to shake off your sins, remember
that your condemnation will be so much more
just, if you do it not; for God required no hard
thing for you to do: and if it be so easie, why
is it not hitherto done? Why do you mock God
so often, and pretend every year to repent, and
yet are every year as bad, if not worse than
other? Why are not <hi>the fruits of repentance</hi> seen
in the amendment of life for one year, or a
moneth, or one bare week? Is it not worth
while to do so little for him, that hath done so
much for you? Methinks, common ingenuity
might prevail with men, at least to let God have
some part of their lives entire to himself,
without interfering with the Devil. But there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
lyes a great part of the <hi>deceitfulness of sin,</hi>
that it falls out here, as in some malignant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases,
men seldom understand their danger, till
they are almost past recovery.</p>
            <p>3. None are so likely to be hardned in sin, as
those who delay and put off their repentance.
For the very putting it off is a sign that sin
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95214:23"/>
hath a greater power, than the convictions of
Conscience: for why should men ever intend to
repent, if they did not think it necessary? and
if they think it necessary and yet do it not, it is
plain there is something within them stronger
than Conscience, which keeps them from it.
So that he that intends to repent, and yet lives
in sin, hath that aggravation of sin above others,
that he sins against his Conscience all that time.
Tell me then, O thou subtle sinner, that hopest
to be too hard for God and for sin too, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
thy sins as long as thou canst, and then
repenting at last, to escape the vengeance of
God: dost thou in good earnest intend ever to
repent or no? If thou dost not, never deceive thy
self; God will not accept these pretences and
promises instead of real repentance. If thou
dost intend it sincerely, what makes thee to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it? is it not, that thou art convinced it is
much better to be done than not, but canst not
find it in thy heart to do it yet? Thou knowest
all this while it were much better to leave thy
sins, than to live in them, it were far better to be
sober, and temperate, and pious, and devout, than
to be debauched and profane; and yet for all
this, thou dost not repent, but goest on in the
same course. Consider then, that this very cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance
deeply aggravates every sin that is
committed after it. For it is not a bare neglect
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95214:23"/>
of repentance, which thou art guilty of, but a
contempt of God and Goodness; it is, not only
not repenting, but it is an obstinate and wilful
resolution of sinning: for there is no <hi>medium</hi>
between living in sin and forsaking of it; and
nothing deserves the name of Repentance, that is
short of that. And if thou art so wilful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
now, as notwithstanding thy resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to repent, to live still in thy sins, how canst
thou ever hope to repent at last, when thy
heart will be so much more hardned by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
in sin?</p>
            <p>4. Lastly, Consider the sad condition of those
who are hardned through the deceitfulness of
sin.<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 19.</note> They are said in Scripture to be <hi>past feeling,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 28.</note>
and <hi>to be given over to a reprobate mind, i. e.</hi> to have
lost all sense of their danger, and of the ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
they are in; they despise all means of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
and scorn all those who would do
them good, and who mean them no other injury
but to perswade them to be happy. With what
disdain and contempt do those proud and lofty
sinners, who are once arrived at this height of
wickedness, look down upon all those, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
by <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Scripture</hi> to convince them
of their sins! As though it were not possible for
any thing to make men seem more ridiculous to
them, than to see them concerned to plead the
cause of Vertue and Religion. <q>To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95214:24"/>
is all this ado about Repentance? why
should not men be let alone to do as they
think fit? for let them preach their hearts out,
men will do as they please.</q> This is the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of those who are already hardned in their
sins; but God forbid, it should be so of any here
present; who make it our prayer to God <hi>to be
delivered from hardness of heart, and contempt of his
word and commandments.</hi> And we have great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
so to do; for there is no judgement short
of hell, like to the being given up to a <hi>reprobate
sense:</hi> for all the most weighty arguments and
most forcible perswasions are to such but like
showres falling upon a Rock, that make some
noise and slide off again, but make no impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
or entrance into them. <hi>God Almighty</hi> give
us all his <hi>Grace</hi> to understand our danger and to
repent in time, that <hi>none of us be hardned through
the deceitfulness of sin.</hi>
