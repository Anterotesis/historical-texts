            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader (for so I hope to finde thee) so nefande and execrable, I confesse, haue beene the practises of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi> in this exorbitant age of the world, as late barbarous attempts at home, &amp; a later bloudy deed abroad can well testifie: that no man I thinke hath a toung so Satirically invectiue, that hee can any waye make the bitternes of his speech correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the cruelty of their actions. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these Apologues long since fitted to their follies, in comparison with it, may seeme vnto thee like <hi>Domitions</hi> pricking of flies, in regard of managing the astaires of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: yet good vse may be made of them in these our dayes. For as in former time among the Romans (who were neuer almost with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out warres) there were <hi>Ludi Circences,</hi> and <hi>Naumachiae,</hi> plaies as they accounted them,
<pb facs="tcp:11209:3"/>
but in nature consonant to their present im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; for they did both yeeld recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the present, and also excercise them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any future ocasion; so in these our daies of warfare against the trecheries of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, after thy wiriting against their errors, or reading of graue controuersies, or at least more serious consideration of their irreligious practices against vs; these Apologues may serue vnto thee as a recreation, and yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all they wil afford thee a manifest declaration of some of their sortish superstitions, &amp; good arguments against them: for vnder a fabulous <hi>superficies,</hi> thou shalt find true substance, and in a seeming tale manifesteth truth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as <hi>Virgil</hi> on a time hauing some of old <hi>Ennius</hi> his workes in his hands, said to one asking him what hee did, <hi>Ex Ennis stercoro aurum colligo:</hi> so maist thou, reading in this booke answeare any demaunding what thou dost, that thou gatherest gold out of the dust of Apologues. But (that I may come to my selfe) if the plainenes of the translation bee not pleasing to curious eares, I Apologize for my selfe two waies; first, that mine Author shall excuse mee, whom I so followed as one intending to translate, and not to make a new. Secondly, (wherein also I excuse mine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor)
<pb facs="tcp:11209:3"/>
that the forme of the Apologues is such, namely, a relation of Dialogues, where <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam</hi> and <hi>inquit</hi> is oft inferred, that it could not bee otherwise. Yet as gold is not to bee refused, because it is digged out of the earth, nor pearles, because they are found in the sands: so I hope these witty conceites, will not bee distastfull to any, although they bee not related in curious tearmes; and that I shall not deserue dispraise in immitating him in words, of whom I borrowed the subiect of my speech. And so committing my selfe &amp; my translation to thy censure, I commit thee and my selfe to him that will censure vs both: wishing thee as thou likest this first booke, so to expect more of me hereafter.</p>

The Noble man perceiuing this diuersity <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> caused them all to be sent for, and to be assembled into his Chamber, and then said thus vnto them. When I first fell

sicke, I caused all the Phisitians in the City to come vnto mée: and they could not agrée a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselues to giue me a medicine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that euery one of them, to séeme more learned then the rest, reproued all that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would haue giuen mée, &amp; counselled mee to take that which he would administer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee. Therefore calling them togither, I said vnto them, euery one of you would haue me take the Phisicke which he hath ordained for mée, now if I should take all, they would bring my body into worse estate then it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready if not kill mée, and if I should resolue to take but one, I know not which to choose: wherefore you shall goe into this next cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, from whence you shall not come, vntill you doe agrée to giue me a medicine approued of you all to be the best; then the Phisitians, knowing that long fasting would bring dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to their owne bodies, did quickely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and brought me physicke; assuring mee that it was farre better, and more agreable to my maladie then any they would before haue giuen mée.

               <p>THere was a Bishop of Denmarke, who because he dwelt farre from Rome, and that diuers occasions might happen in his Bishoprick to cause him to send to the Pope; did for a thousand crownes buy the Popes whole authority, with this <hi>prouiso,</hi> that hee should vse the farce no farther then the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts of his owne Dicresse: notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he so behaued himselfe: that complaints of him were brought vnto Rome, so that the Pope cited him to make his personall appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance before him, and the Bishop at the day appointed was present. Now because that hee was a man of great authority, the Pope held the Articles whereof hee was accused in his owne hands, and examined him before all the Prelates, saying, wee haue vnderstood that you haue charged your people with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny new fasts ordained by you, as if ours were not sufficient, but that you must sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our imperfections: and you (said the Bishop)
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:11209:13"/>
haue grieued the poeple with fasts ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by you, as if that the temperance and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety giuen vnto men by God were not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, but vnperfect, vnlesse you added som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing thereunto. Againe said the Pope, wee gaue you our authority, to the end that you should make men obserue our ordinances, and not to forge a new Christianity: so (said the Bishop) Iesus Christ hath giuen his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority vnto you <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to this end and purpose, that you should cause men to keepe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, and not by adding yours thereunto, to make a new Christian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. We should haue liked it well (said the Pope) if for the good of your Church, you had made any statute or ordinance, so that you had not also made the breach thereof a mortall sinne, but you haue obliged the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thereunto vpon paine of eternall death, and which is more, haue more seuerely pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ished the transgressors of your commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then the transgressours of ours. In like manner (said the Bishop) if you had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained any indifferent thing for the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of your Church, and not tyed men to the keeping thereof vnder paine of damnation, it had not béene displeasing to God: but you on the contrary haue decréed that whosoeuer
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:11209:14"/>
will not obserue your commandements, shall goe to hell; and doe inflict more grieuous pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment on those which transgresse your or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, then on those which break the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of God; wherefore I haue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed you, as your good and obedient sonne. Then the Pope said againe vnto him, but wherefore haue you commaunded, that in your fasts the people shall drinke but once? If you (said the Bishop) haue ordained, that in your fasts men shall eate but once; why may not I hauing all your authority (so that I can by no meanes erre) commaund that they drinke but once in mine? but were it not much better (said the Pope) that they dranke thrée or fower times, rather then poure down so much at once to make their eies stare, and their bellies cracke againe? So (said the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop) they who eate but once in your fasts doe so gorge themselues that their bellies are euen ready to breake, and were it not much more profitable for the health of their bodies, if they made thrée or foure moderate repasts of that which they gourmundize at once? But what folly is it of you (said the Pope) that in your fasts you haue wholly denied bread? what would you haue them eate? And what I pray you (said the Bishop) hath mooued
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:11209:14"/>
you to forbid the vse of flesh, and egges, and milke in your fasts? what would you haue them eate in those dayes? Other things (said the Pope) ordained for their sustenance; men may likewise liue without bread (said the Bishop.) But if néede bée (said the Pope) I permit the vse of flesh, so they pay me for it. So I (said the Bishop) suffer my people to eate bread if they will buy a licence of mée. But bread (said the Pope is a creature ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by God for the sustenance of mans life; so (replied the Bishop) is flesh created of God for the benefite of men, yet you notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing haue forbidden it. The Pope was now at the end of his roule, and for a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion added this. There is one thinge more, which indeed hath offended vs more then all the rest, which is, that when any of your subiects being grieued by your strange ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, doe flye vnto vs for succour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, you confiscate all their goods, yea and put them to death also, if they fall into your hands. That also (said the Bishop) I learned of you Holy Father; for if any one oppressed by your intolerable imposito<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, haue recourse to God, hoping through faith only to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine remission of his sinnes; you cause him to be burned, because he did not beg absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:11209:15"/>
of the Priests and Monkes by you or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained; accounting him an heritique, who puts all his trust in God onely through Iesus Christ his welbeloued sonne, our onely saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and aduorate. Well to conclude, the Pope would haue punished him, but that the Bishop shewed he could not doe it, but hee must much condemne himselfe thereby, and greatly derogate from his authority, for (said hee) séeing I haue done nothing, but I did it as I was Pope, and by the authority which you haue giuen mee, if you punnish mée, it will follow, that the Pope as hee is Pope may erre, and by consequence the Popdome will loose much of its credit and reputation. The Pope was aduised that hee spake the truth. Wherefore he commanded him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his presentment to the Popdome, and to resigne his authority, which he would not do, aleadging that the Popdome was his, for he had well bought it, then the Pope offered to restore his thousand crownes, which hee paid for it: but the Bishop would not accept of them, both by reason of the great gaines he made thereof, as also for the great honour he receiued thereby. Finally, the Pope sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no remedy, did earnestly intreat him, that he would gouerne himselfe so wisely in

Peter</hi> was neuer at Rome, and therefore could not leaue the Popedome to the Bishops of Rome, which Iesus Christ (if men will belieue it) left vnto him: but another answered him, and said, if they haue no other reasons, they can neuer bring their enterprise to passe, for to ouerthrow the Popdome they must prooue, not that <hi>S. Peter</hi> was neuer at Rome, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that the great Diuell of hell was neuer there: and then it will necessarily follow, that no Bishop of Rome was Pope, seeing
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:11209:16"/>
that, not <hi>S. Peter,</hi> but the Diuell brought the Popedome thither: now because they shall neuer be able to prooue that the Diuell hath not beene at Rome, which is the chiefe and principall Citty where the Diuell keepes his residence, it followes that by this meanes, they cannot ruinate the Popedome.</p>

               <p>IT happened on a time as Pope <hi>Clement</hi> was at dinner, that certaine of the Monks disputed in his presence, whether the Pope might erre or no? and after long disputations they concluded that he might erre as he was man, but not as Pope; and the Pope giuing eare vnto them said, you are dissembling flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, for we erre dayly in many things, &amp; neuerthelesse we are Pope still. Then one of them answering said, that when he erred it was as hee was man, and not as Pope; to whom the Pope replied thus: when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow Bishoprickes, it is certaine that wée doe it as Pope, and yet therein we often erre in conferring them on wicked persons, estée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them to bee honest men.

Then the Cardinall said, although the rule of my religion be different from that of Christ, yet is it not contrary: but (said they) the rule of Iesus Christ is so perfect, that nothing can be added therevnto, for wee ran doe no good worke to the glory of God but we are obliged vnto it, by the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect law of God, which commaundeth vs to honour him aboue all thinges, in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, at all times, and by all meanes possible: wherefore if your religion being (according to your owne speeches) different from that of Christ, doe commaund any thing which you are not tyed to doe by the law of God, it followeth that it is all naught, seeing that God hath commaunded all thinges which are good. Now that those things which you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund besides the commandements of God
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:11209:24"/>
are all bad, and wicked, yea and contrary to those thinges which God commaundeth, it appeareth plainely, for you forbid your sect to preach, and Christ would haue the Gospell preached in season and out of season: you would not haue them labour, and take paines, and God commaundeth that wee should get our bread with the sweate of our browes: you exempt them from their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their Parents, Princes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Maiestrates, and God commaunds the contrary, that wee honour our fathers and mothers, and be obedient to the higher powers; you forbid them to marry, although they haue not the guift of contineutie, but God on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contrary inuits men to holy mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; you commaund them to abide alwaies in the Monastery, although they bee indued with good guifts from aboue to do some good and holy worke abroad: and so of all your ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, where with men being fast bound they are depriued of the true spiritual Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an liberty, and in nothing subiect and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to God, and the holy spirit.

Monkes, who thinke to be iustified and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not by the obseruation of the Law of God, but by kéeping their owne lawes, and ordinances, inuented and forged by their owne braines: and also there are very many ceremonies amongst them which are not ionely without reason, foolish and ridiculous, but also full of impiety, and directly repugnant to the Law and Gospell of God: as not to be obedient to parents, or Princes, not to marry although they haue not the guift of continence, not to labour, not to preach, and a rabble of other fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies almost innumerable: and yet for all this you hould them for Christians.

Then the <hi>Cerretan</hi> said, you are a very hereticke, who would thus limit the power of the Pope: tell mee I pray you is not God
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:11209:44"/>
omnipotent? may not hee doe what hee will? can any one limit or bound the power of God? And the Legate answered no: so (repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Cerretan</hi>) in as much as the Pope hath all the power of God, as his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant on earth, none can bound or restraine his power. But, said the Legate, wee read that out of hell there is no redemption, but that the paines thereof are eternall. Doe not you know (said the <hi>Cerretan</hi> that there is no rule so generall but hath some exception? that which you say is to bee vnderstood thus. That they cannot ordinarily bee deliuered thence: as heere in the prisons of <hi>Venice</hi> the malefactors kept therein cannot come out when ther will, notwithstanding the Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory can set them at liberty when they please. But (said the Legate) what authority haue you ouer hell? The same (said hee) which the Pope hath ouer Purgatory; but I haue gained more by Hell then by Purgatory, and therefore if the Pope would follow my councell, hee might quickly fill his coffers with Treasure: the Legate asked him how? And hee saide, If hee would say that hee would deliuer Soules out of Hell; which might easily bee done, if (on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) in that place of his Bulles, where
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:11209:44"/>
hee saith, Deliuer soules out of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, hee would also adde deliuer Soules out of Hell. But the chiefe and principall matter of the businesse is, (said the Legate) not that hée onely say so in wordes, but that they bee deliuered in déed and effect. What (said the <hi>Cerretan</hi>) neede the Pope care whether they be deliuered or no, so that the world doth beléeue they are deliuered? Is it not sufficient for him, that hée may fill his Chests with the gaine which hee reaps thereby? But (said the Legate) it is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard matter to make the world beléeue that hée can deliuer soules out of Hell: nay (said the <hi>Cerretan</hi>) so much hath hée blinded and besotted the world that it is a very easie matter. Yea if you well consider it, you shall find that the Pope shall haue much lesse la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to perswade the poore world that he can deliuer Soules out of hell, then that he can frée them from Purgatory. For as touching Purgatory, hée hath two labours, the first to make men understand that there is a Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; the second to make them beléeue that he can deliuer Soules thence: but as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hell, whereas euery one is already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that there is one, there remaineth but one labour for him, which is to make men

               <p>THere was a Pope, who had loued his mother dearely, I therefore for a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of her kept her Picture alwayes han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in his presence Chamber; now the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador of Florence vnderstanding of it, as also in what part of the chamber it was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, hauing occasion on a time to goe to the Pope, when he entred into the Chamber hee presently knéeled downe before the picture, turning his backside to the Pope, before hee had done his duty to him, and the Pope very much disdaining at it reprehended him for the little manners and reuerence he vsed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him; but the Embassador excusing himself, said, we Florentines haue a custome that when we enter into our great Church of Florence, incontinently we do reuerence to the Image of the mother of Iesus Christ, turning our backs to her sonne, who (as they

say) is in the host, and the Monkes of that Church say, that it is the will of Christ wée should doe so: wherefore I thought it would likewise haue pleased your Holinesse, that I should haue done reuerence to the picture of your Mother, before I did reuerence to you.

               <p>THere was a Gentleman of <hi>Venice,</hi> who would neuer worship the host; for the which being on a time reprehended by the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:11209:46"/>
Popes Legate, hee answered and said, I haue not this long time worshipped Christ in the Sacrament, neither will I euer doe it; for if he bee present there at all (which I will presuppose to ease you of the labour of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it) yet as your selues say hee is not there vntill the Priest hath finished the words of consecration, with an intent to consecrate it. Now because hee alwaies speaketh the words with a low voyce, I am neuer certaine whether he speaketh them or noe: againe, if I did heare him speake the words, I am not sure that hee doth it with an intent to consecrate, especially, because I find by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that the Priests are commonly ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and dissemblers. Therefore being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine that hee is in the host, and most certaine that hee is in heauen, what euill doe I, if I worship him in heauen, and not in the host? for knowing that the Masse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priests haue very little faith or none at all; would you haue me commit to their credit a matter of such consequence as to leaue off worshiping of Christ where I am assured he is, to worship him where I altogether doubt of his presence? but put y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> case that I were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so sure that he is in the host, as I doubt not that he is in heauen: what iniury should I do

               <p>THe Bishoppes being assembled at Trent, w<hi rend="sup">e</hi> a purpose to enact somthing beneficiall to the Romish Church, one of them said that it was good that euery one proposed his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion therein, to the end they might adde som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge to the dignity of the Popedome, as Bishoppes in precedent Counsels had done; but some answered y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> it was sufficient to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould and maintaine it in that scale of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes whervnto it had already attained, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in these times wher many did endeauour to ruinate &amp; bring it to distructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; besids being it was already mounted to that height of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:11209:47"/>
that if they would haue it vnder heauen they could exalt it no higher. The other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that it was their parts not onely to preserue it, but also still to indeauour to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and exalt it: for as (said hee) wee who liue in this world, are but trauellers and possengers, neuer, during this life, attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the wished end of soueraigne perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but aspiring dayly vnto it: so in like manner the Popedome is not yet come to the highest degree thereof. The Lutherans say that the holy spirit taught the Apostles all thinges necessary to saluation: but we hold on the contrary, that the same holy spirit doth day by day giue greater light vnto his Church, by reuealing new thinges vnto it: wherefore wee ought to hope that hee will reueale vnto vs some hidden secret which may serue much to the exaultation of the Popedome, Then one of the most ancient among them said, at the beginning they who came to visit the Bishop of Rome did kisse his mouth, as <hi>Iudas</hi> kissed Iesus Christ; but after hee was made Bishoppe of Bish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops, they kissed his hand in token of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reuerence: after that beeing made equal to the Emperour, whereas hee was moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted higher, it was fit that they should kisse
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:11209:47"/>
lower, and therefore they did kisse his knée: at length when hee was ascended aboue the Emperours, they began to kisse his foote (as they doe at this day) because it was the lowest and basest member of man: but as yet they kisse the vpper part, and not the sole of the foote, but now seeing that the Pope is exaulted not onely aboue the Emperour, but also aboue Iesus Christ himselfe, I think it fit that the Crosse which hee hath hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore worne on the vpper part of his shooe, be hereafter placed on the sole thereof; and that all henceforth who will doe reuerence to the Pope, euen to the Emperour himselfe, bee compelled to kisse the bottome of his foote; which will bee a very great exaultation of the Popedome; for wee shall thereby plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shew that the Pope is so highly aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in glory, that hee hath troad vnder his feete the Crosse of Iesus Christ, and all holy thinges. Hee had scarcely ended these words, before all the Bishoppes (lifting vp their hands towards heauen, and giue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing praise to God for the reuelation of so great a secret) began to say, that although in that Councell they did determine of nothing else but that, and could profite the Church by no other meanes yet they thought
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:11209:48"/>
that they had well bestowed their cost and paines in comming togither. Wherefore in all hast they made it an article of faith. But they say that Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> was not well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with it, because hee was vnwilling to take so much paines as to lift vp his foote to all that came vnto him, as also because he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that if he did lift vp his foote when hee was standing he should fal downe backward; so that the Bishops were very much discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, because they thought that they had neuer made any decree better, or more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to their religion.</p>

               <p>A Certaine Romane Gent. caused an enig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall discription of the foure first facts of their religion to bee made in a fayre house which hee had in the Countrey. And in the first place there was painted a Monke of the order of S. <hi>Benet,</hi> with scroles and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings in his hand, and attournies, proctors, and notaries round about him; who taking Mounsier Monke by the habite did drawe him, one this way another that way, to shew that they are neuer out of strife and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Next there was a young Frier of S <hi>Augustine,</hi> who hauing a faire beard did Kombe it with one hand, and held a looking glasse in the other, wherein hee beheld how hansome it was.

In the last place was a Cordelier, who held downe his head, hauing his hood ouer his eyes, and his armes a crosse within his sleeues, so that hee seemed to bee a Saint; but out at one of his sleeues, there hung part of a roasted Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon which he perceiued not.</p>

               <p>IN the Councel of Trent (as I haue heard) the Fathers did discourse of faith and good workes, wresting the Scriptures to proue that faith was not sufficient to iustifie vs, but that workes also were thereto required;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:11209:49"/>
And there was a Bishop amongst them of great learning as they thought, who said, I meruaile greatly that the Lutherans, dare say that faith alone doth Iustifie, seeing that there is a text in the Gospell which doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly beat downe this their opinion, and I wonder much more at our selues, that none of vs heretofore could finde it out; for by this meanes we had long since shut vp the mouths of all the Lutherans, and constrayned them to magnifie good workes, and say with vs that they iustifie. And willing to reueale it vnto them, hée said, doe yee not remember, that it is written in the Gospell that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles being in a shippe tossed with a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest. Iesus Christ appeared vnto them on the waues, and that S. <hi>Peter</hi> (who was then a Lutheran beleeuing that faith alone was sufficient to saue him) said vnto Christ bid me come vnto thee on the waters? and that after Christ had commaunded him to come, hee leapt into the sea with his faith, and was almost drowned? Yea hee had been drowned in
deed, if Iesus Christ had not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculously aided him, and placed him againe in the barke, making him returne vnto works and rowing with the oare. Wherefore, let who will do as <hi>Peter</hi> did, &amp; be drowned with
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:11209:49"/>
their trust in Iesus Christ, for my part I am determined not to abandon the little ship but therein (for my better assurance) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine rowing with the Dare, and trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with workes, these his spéeches (as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the reuelation of a rare and excellent secret) were entertained with a great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause by all the other Bishops, except the Bishop of <hi>Caua,</hi> who said thus, my opinion is that whereas <hi>Peter</hi> began to sinke, it came to passe not by reason of his faith, but of his infidelity and want of faith. And therefore Christ reprehending him said, O thou of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle faith! why didst thou feare? As if he had said, If thou hadst béene strong in faith, thou mightst safely haue marched vpon the waues of the Sea. So that if other Bishops héereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did not produce this text of Scripture to proue that faith alone was not sufficient to saue vs, it was because they did plainely sée that it serued nothing to their purpose. Hée had scarce made an end of speaking, but a Bishop great in wealth and dignity, called the <hi>Greguetto,</hi> said that he was an hereticke, for his words did sauour strongly of heresie. Now the first Bishop (who was very angry that his reason which hee thought inuincible was gainsaid) when hée perceiued that his
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:11209:50"/>
opinion was maintained by a man of such credit, hee ranne vpon the Bishop of <hi>Caua</hi> which contradicted him and paid him by the beard, and had done worse to him if the rest had not speedily come betwéene them, and parted them, and also reconciled them one to the other, inioyning them straitly that for the honour of the Councell they should neuer speake word of it.</p>

               <p>IT is reported that the Emperor was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to haue three questions disputed and agreed vpon at the Councell of Trent. The first whereof was, whether <hi>Constantine</hi> could giue Rome, or did giue it to the Bishop of Rome? The second, whether it were true as <hi>Platina</hi> hath written, that the Emperor <hi>Phoca</hi> was hee who gaue power to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rome to be Superior and chiefe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bishops: and whether by that it did fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that the power of the Pope did depend on him? The third, whether it were conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to reason, that a Bishop who ought to be busied altogether in spirituall thinges, should also haue the gouernment of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall estate? These questions (they say) hee
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:11209:50"/>
gaue to the best learned of the Lutherans; that they might study and examine them well, to the end they might come to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell armed and furnished with good and sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid reasons. When the Pope heard of this hee was very much perplexed with it, and therefore proposed this enterprize of the Emperor to the Cardinalls in the Consisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to know their mindes therein; and some of them tolde him, that hee had no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys for it, but to hinder the Councell by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing new warres and dissentions in the Christian Common-wealth. But others were of opinion that it was more for the Popes profit to agree secretly with the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans; to which the Pope answered, we would willingly yeelde vnto them in all thinges which concerne the soule, so that they would suffer our Kingdome and Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to remaine safe and entire without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minishing.</p>

                  <hi>Paul</hi> (who was the Lord <hi>Loys</hi> his father) being much displeased with it, said to the Emperors Embassador that hee would haue him certifie his Maiesty, that if he did not out of hand restore it to him, hee would excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate him &amp; publish his excommunication in the world: but the Embassador answered &amp; said vnto him; As fathers to keep their little Children in feare and obedience are accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to shew them vizards and other strange sights, to make them affraid; in like maner your Holines to keep the Christians in feare and subiection, haue found meanes to terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them by excommunicating, Anathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing and cursing them; causing them to bee painted with fire and Diuells round about them, and euen as little Children when they come to maturity and yeares of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, do no more stand in feare of their Fathers Bug-beares: So the Christians, (who thankes bée to God begin to open their eyes) doe now little regard your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications; wherefore may it please you to vnders

               <p>THere was in times past a Monastery of Nunnes, which by reason of factions and dissentions raigning in it (according to the custome of all other) as also for many other respects might very well bee called hell. The Abbesse well knowing it, on a day called all the Nunnes together into the Chapter house and said vnto them: Yée sée plainely how mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable our life is, in this place, where wee liue as it were in a coniinuall hell; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt if we perseuere in this kind of life, wée shall one day goe to the other. Ye know well that when wee came first into this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery, wée were pure as Angells, chast, humble, deuout, feruent to call vppon God, charitable, and full of all vertues: but think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to come hether, as to the schoole of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, wee are become crafty, proud, facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, vnchast, enuicus, disobedient, couetous, yea filled with all kind of impiety; and yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day wee grow worse and worse, so that without all hope wée shall be damned, if wee doe not in time seeke some remedy. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:11209:64"/>
I earnestly intreat you that if yée know any meanes to redresse it, ye will impart it to mée, and if it bée good, I wil very willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put it in practise. Then one of them said, I thinke it good that we resigne our offices to nouices, (who are Angels in respect of vs) and that wée choose out of them, one to bée Abbesse, another to bee Uicaresse, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be Mistres of the schoole, and so, for all other principall offices; and this wee ought to yéeld vnto, because they are not yet entred into our factions, nor diuided among vs, but are pure and vertuous, so that wée béeing gouerned by them may procure our owne safety, and after our deathes the Monastery will bee reformed. But all the rest opposed themselues against her, saying: Truely that were a faire mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that wee should become nouices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and now at length obey them which yet sauour strongly of the world; and it were a great credit surely for vs that the world should know that wee had so resigned our offices to nouices; it is far better (if you would not haue the nouices corrupted) that they gouerne themselues, and we our selues; the other replied, that so of one Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry they should make two, and beside the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:11209:65"/>
nouices should haue none to teach &amp; instruct them in the Ceremonies of Religion. In the end, the Abbesse séeing they could not agrée among themselues, said, for my part I thinke it most expedient for vs, that wee burne the Monastery, and that all of vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne some to our friendes, where wee may liue peaceably, and honestly: this motion pleased them them all, and within a while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they set it on fire and departed.</p>

When their father perceiued it, hée much wondred and grieued at it, and calling them vnto him, hee sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reprehended them, and demounded of them where, and of whom they had learned

sonne of his which was lately dead, saying, that by them he should bee deliuered out of Purgatory, and hee, making as though hée were perswaded by their words, said vnto them, goe and say your Masses, and if my sonne be deliuered by them, as your promise is, I will giue you a crowne; so the Corde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers went to the Temple, and quickly mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled vp their Masses, and then returned to him for the crowne, but hée said first shewe mée some token that yée haue deliuered my sonne out of Purgatorie and then I will giue it you; for so farre am I from knowing that hée is fréed from Purgatorie by your Masses, that I cannot tell whether hée went thither or no when hée died: when the Cordeliers saw hée would not satisfie their expectation, they went vnto the Duke, humbly intreating him that hée would doe them iustice; and hée presently sent for the Cittizen to come before him, and asked him why hée would not pay the Friers the crowne which hee promised them?
