            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N <hi>Greece,</hi> there dwelt a mighty King called <hi>Aegeus,</hi> who had raigned fiftie yeeres; fortunate and ſucceſſiue in all his warlike affayres: that through the puiſſance of his force to his foes, and bountifull courteſie to his friends; he was feared in hate, and imbraced in loue. This <hi>Aegeus</hi> had one onely Sonne, whoſe name was <hi>Theſeus,</hi> who was by birth Royall, learned by education, by Nature va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous, and by Vertues famous: inſomuch that it was hard to iudge whether his valour, Fortune, or Vertue wonne the greateſt praiſe.</p>
            <p>This young Prince, being ſo richly adorned with ſhe rare feats and accompliſhments of Chiualry that he did not onely enioy his Fathers loue, but alſo wonne his Subiects hearts: at that inſtant, there liued <hi>Meleagar,</hi> King of <hi>Achaia,</hi> not farre diſtant from the Court of <hi>Aegeus,</hi> who had a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a faire young Virgin, whoſe name was <hi>Titana,</hi> her ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous diſpoſitions were ſuch, as might iuſtly challenge more loue than the world could yéeld her: for her beauty was ſuch, as it tainted <hi>Venus</hi> chéekes, her vertue ſhadowed <hi>Diana</hi>'s Altars, her learning ſtayned ſacred <hi>Pallas,</hi> &amp; her loyalty was

When this ſolemne Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph was quite ended, the people returned vnto their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer labour, and wonted courſe of life, where wéele leaue them and turne to <hi>Theſeus:</hi> who though but yong in yeares, yet old in experience, though valorous with <hi>Hercules,</hi> yet not too venturous with <hi>Phaëton</hi>; though vpheld with the wings of Fortune, yet not raſh in flying with <hi>Icarus,</hi> but kéeping lower bounds with <hi>Daedalus</hi>; hee feared not the Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolts of <hi>Jove,</hi> nor yet the raging waues of <hi>Neptune:</hi> well (to be briefe:)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſeus,</hi> who had euer ſince hée was able to harbour, or conceiue one amorous thought, mark'd the excellency of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana's</hi> behauiour, and the exquiſitie of her beauty, perſwaded himſelfe that ſhe was matchleſſe on earth: in ſo much, that at
<pb facs="tcp:15733:4"/>
laſt he fell into paſſionate affections with <hi>Titana;</hi> and burſt out his paſſions in theſe tearmes, being alone in a garden, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnder an Orenge Trée:</p>
            <p>Ah <hi>Theſeus</hi> thou art a Kings ſonne, and art applauded by the <hi>Greekes,</hi> to be the only champion of this climat, and wilt thou liue a ſlaue to <hi>Venus,</hi> confin'd and bard of libertie? no, no, caſt off theſe fooliſh affections; for <hi>Theſeus,</hi> ſurely thou doſt not loue, theſe are but inſtant conceits, ſwéetned with hony, or fire made with ſtraw, they are not Amors of perfection.</p>
            <p>Ah <hi>Theſeus,</hi> flatter not thy ſelfe, thy heart doth féele ſhe deadly wound of <hi>Cupids</hi> Dart: Oh, that blinde boy hath pierſt it cleane through, like an <hi>Indian</hi> pearle: yet be cheareful <hi>Theſeus,</hi> what néedſt thou feare, thou knoweſt the ſalue to cure thy amorous corraſiue: <hi>Titana,</hi> is a Kings Daughter, and ſhe is by birth Royall, learned by education, faire by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by vertues famous and by poſſeſſions rich: why then what néedſt thou feare, caſt off theſe deſpairing follies, and put on aſſuring fancies, for <hi>Cupid</hi> neuer throwes his Dart, but <hi>Venus</hi> ſéekes the wound: why then <hi>Theſeus,</hi> art thou a Prince, a valiant Souldier, and wilt liue thus perplexed with fooliſh loue, or a wound giuen by a Boy? expell ſuch capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall follies, as would include thee with ignominious conceits, when he had thus ſufficiently explained his paſſions, &amp; ſearcht the deepneſſe of his ſtill bleeding wound, he takes his farwell of the Orenge Trée, that ſhaddowed him from the beames of <hi>Phoebus,</hi> and returnes to his chamber, where weele leaue him ruminating on his loue, and turne to <hi>Titana</hi>: Who all this while euen from her infancie, had noted the princely geſture of <hi>Theſeus,</hi> &amp; ſeeing his face ſo perfectly featured, and viewing each limb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the portraiture of his body ſo well limited, that ſhe greatly commended <hi>Dame</hi> Natures art, and excellencie in ſhaddowing ſuch perfection vnder her Fortunes lot: perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding herſelfe, that none but <hi>Theſeus</hi> ſhould reape the harneſt of her affection: being thus perplexed with inordinate paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp; poſſeſt with amorous affection, it wrought like a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation

            <p>Ah <hi>Titana,</hi> (thou art in loue) (I) with whom? with <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus,</hi> (with <hi>Theſeus)</hi> hee is a Kings ſonne, why ſo art thou a Kings Daughter; he is famous in birth; thou art vertuous, and faire by Nature; he is a Prince, why thou art a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe: thou euery way art equiualent with him: why then, if thou loneſt <hi>Theſeus, Theſeus</hi> cannot chuſe but loue <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana:</hi> Ah <hi>Titana,</hi> thou fond foole, ſigh, ſob, and lament thee of thy follies, art thou ſo fond to thinke that <hi>Theſeus</hi> being a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant warrier, the <hi>Grecians</hi> champion, and heire apparent to that inuincible King <hi>Aegeus,</hi> will looke on thee? no, thou art not an obiect fitting for his expectiue eye, though thy vertuous qualities be oppoſite to his valorous accompliſhments, yet he cannot loue <hi>Titana:</hi> why? <hi>Titana</hi> is beautifull, vertuous, and rich, I, and after her Fathers deceaſe heire to the Crowne of rich <hi>Achaia:</hi> why then <hi>Titana,</hi> ſuppreſſe theſe franticke paſſions, and incline to louely affections, for doe thou but ſmile, hee cannot chuſe but loue: well when ſhe had thus at large playd and diſplayd her paſſionate affection, ſhe returnes to her chamber, to be melancholy, where wéele leaue her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſeus,</hi> who had receiued ſuch a deadly wound, thought it long vntill he had ſome remedy for it, ſtarts him vp from the imbracements of his reſtleſſe bed, and walkes towards the Court of <hi>Meleagar:</hi> euen at his approach within the Court gates, ſhe clocke ſtrucke eight: quoth <hi>Theſeus,</hi> it is too earely dayes to ſéeke to ſpeake with <hi>Titana</hi> yet; Ile goe walke a courſe or two about the Gorden, till the clocke ſtrikes againe, and that I thinke will be about the time of <hi>Titana's</hi> riſing: he immediately turnes on the backe ſide of the Court, to enter into the Garden, but when he came he found the doore faſt lockt: yet Fortune willing to fauour his preſence, would not ſuffer him to returne, but cauſed him to knocke, the which hée did, and immediatly it was opened by a Groome of <hi>Titana's</hi> chamber: quoth <hi>Theſeus,</hi> where is your Lady and miſtris,
<pb facs="tcp:15733:5"/>

ſmile, as loue giues louers direction (and thus beginnes.) Faire <hi>Titana,</hi> euer ſince I could conceiue one Amorous thought, or caſt a wanton eye on beauties perfection, I haue remained imburthened with the eſſence of your beauty, and wounded with the vlcerous ſore of your loue: therefore, faire Lady reiect me not with diſdaine, becauſe I approach with courteſie: and as our two aged Fathers liue in peacefull ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo let vs combine a matrimoniall vnity, it will not onely be a comfort to them, but alſo an eternall ioy to vs: <hi>Titana</hi> reſting, and meditating a while, at laſt be paints her chéekes with a maiden bluſh, and thus replies.</p>
            <p>Prince <hi>Theſeus,</hi> this is very ſtrange to mee, that ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate paſſions of loue, ſhould ſo farre ouerflow her ſhores on the ſudden, being no ſtorme nor ſpring to be the cauſer: therefore <hi>Theſeus,</hi> ſurely this is not loue, theſe are but faigned fictions to try ſimplicity: inluring baites, to catch fond folly in wantons ſnares: for <hi>Demophoon</hi> was faire by nature, but prooued falſe to <hi>Phyllis: Aeneas</hi> was a braue man, but as falſe as <hi>Almider:</hi> yet were their proteſted vowes, greater than common hearts can conceiue: Therefore <hi>Theſeus</hi> ſuppreſſe thy paſſions, and leaue to loue <hi>Titana,</hi> for ſhe cannot loue thee againe, ſhee is like the ſtarre <hi>Artophylax,</hi> that is beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the eye, but fit for no vſe: euen ſo is <hi>Titana,</hi> iuſt oppoſite againſt nature: well ſtill ſhe keepes him at the ſtaffes length, and ſits her ſtill on the gréene banke where hee found her: ſhadowing her yéelding paſſions with denying frownes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſeus,</hi> who all this while had mark'd, and viewed each limit of her body, and the feature of her face, thought it very ſtrange, that Nature ſhould endow ſo faire a face, with ſo hard a heart, ſuch comely limmits with ſuch peruerſe conditions? at laſt thus beganne to proſecute his cauſe againe in theſe tearmes.</p>
            <p>Faire <hi>Titana,</hi> be not proud of beauties painting, for it is but a Summers flower, the Winter ſéedes it, and thoſe which diſdaine in youth, are deſpiſed in age: therefore faire Lady,
<pb facs="tcp:15733:7"/>
make not a Goddeſſe of beauty, but yéeld me loue, for loue; and let not the deſtinies cauſe me to deſpaire, now in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of my blooming youth. <hi>Titana</hi> ſitting ſtill on the banke, (as it were) not regarding him, thus beginnes. <hi>Theſeus</hi> I commend thine excéeding wit, but in this caſe, I pitty thy diſtreſſe, and for thy extremity of loue thou beareſt to mée, I vow thee recompence, but with contract I dare not promiſe, therefore good <hi>Theſeus,</hi> ſuppreſſe thoſe paſſions, which now thy minde is perplexed with.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſeus</hi> ſtanding a while, commenting of his dull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, ſcarcely dared vouchſafe to giue an anſwere, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a remedie, yet ſayd hee, opportunities neglected are ſignes of follie, therefore hée beganne againe in theſe tearmes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Titana,</hi> the fatall doubts of cruell death, is not ſo feared of me, but I dare extend my life with fortunes ſate, to enioy thy loue: why then faire Lady, ſith I am ſo wounded with your loue, yéeld to my requeſt, which is within the bounds of modeſtie deſired: If I were laſciuious, demanding vnchaſt deſires to vſe thee as a Concubine, then mighteſt thou iuſtly be peruerſe, &amp; ſay me nay: or were I a begger, or a baſe borne vaſſall of no deſert, or for reputation vile, then would I hold it wiſedome: or came I like a <hi>Scythian</hi> Shepheard, with my ſhéepe-hooke on my neck: but comming like a <hi>Grecian</hi> Prince, with my Scepter in my hand, demanding loue with a chaſt deuotion, me thinkes you ſhould not be ſo peruerſe to deny ſo kind a demand. Quoth <hi>Titana,</hi> good <hi>Theſeus</hi> be not ſo tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, for to be ſhort in tearmes, I will not grant thee loue; for loue is the only thing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Theſeus</hi> hearing her ſtill in that froward denying veine, quite expel'd hope, and included deſpaire: and thus beganne
<pb facs="tcp:15733:8"/>
hee, which ſcarcely found beginning. O wicked and deſpai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring wretch, forlorne, and of <hi>Titana</hi> forſaken, worſe than the ſeruilſt ſlaue in <hi>Achaia,</hi> more baſe than the ſtimie earth vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath thy féete, more in bondage than <hi>Tuniſian</hi> gally ſlaues, more vacant on earth, than <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> and more wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched than <hi>Progne</hi> in her tranſformation: why how cameſt thou thus metamorphoſed being a Kings ſonne? (oh with loue) with loue of that ingratefull <hi>Titana,</hi> for had I not loued <hi>Titana,</hi> ſhe had not cauſed my vntimely death, but meaſuring my adverſe fortune, with thy peruerſe obſtinacy, Ile end my life: and with that hee unſheaſhed his fatall Engine, and ſayd thus: Faire Lady, as like the <hi>Camelion,</hi> I haue liued by the Airy eſſence of thy loue: ſo like faithfull <hi>Theſeus</hi> by thy hate Ile die: He ſets the point of his ſword to his breſt. <hi>Titana</hi> ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſo deſperate, lightly skipt from off the banke where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhe ſate, and ſuddenly takes him by the hand which held his ſword, and thus beganne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſeus,</hi> art thou a Prince, and a Kings ſonne, a warriour, and <hi>Grecians</hi> Champion: and wilt at a wenches frowne ruine thy body, and bring thy aged Fathers gray haires with griefe vnto his graue, and his carefull head on a reſtleſſe pillow? remember this, thou art Heire apparent vnto thy Fathers Crowne and kingdome; and by thy well liuing, thy Fathers daies are prolonged on earth, but by thy ill dying, with griefe they are ſoone ended: why then know this braue <hi>Theſeus,</hi> wenches will moſt deny the thing they moſt deſire; and ſéeme moſt peruerſe, where moſt they loue; and proue moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, where they ſéeme moſt wauering (and ſo will I) I loue, although I faigned a frowne, yet deteſted I to hate, and though my tongue ſayd no, my heart proteſted I.

zealous deuotion, and I loued <hi>Theſeus</hi> with as dutifull af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as <hi>Titana</hi> could performe, or <hi>Theſeus</hi> deſire: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſwéet loue, thinke not I yéeld with vrgent prayers: but with the force of Loue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſeus</hi> noting her behauiour, and hearing ſuch vnexpected tearmes, and ſnared allurements of <hi>Titana,</hi> which made ſuch pleaſing harmony in his halfe dead eares, was halfe rauiſhed, &amp; wholly reuiued to his former ſenſes ſheathed his fatall blade againe, imbracing her in his armes, layd battery to her skar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let lips, with many a ſugred kiſſe he giues aſſault and winnes the Fort: In briefe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they ſuddenly combind, and fully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd a matrimoniall contract, ſo that after many louely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracings, and pleaſing-wanton toyes, (as loue hath many) they parted for the time, ſo fraught with inordinate ioy, that it is impoſſible for the capacity of man to looke ſo high as their ioy did raiſe rebounds.</p>
            <p>Fortune now enuying their good acts, turnes her Whéele, and as ſhe had dimpled her cheekes, ſo now ſhe wrinkled her forehead, and vnréeled the deſtinies, for in <hi>Achaia</hi> there dwelt <hi>Oenie,</hi> which euery yéere did ſacrifice the firſtlings of his ſtore: the which he firſt aſſigned of his corne, and fruits to <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res:</hi> to <hi>Bacchus</hi> the firſt preſſing of his wine: and vnto <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> Oliue oyle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thus honouring the gods of Graine, and fruit, hee offered frankincenſe, but at <hi>Diana's</hi> Altars none was offered, hee ouer ſlipt them, the which <hi>Diana</hi> tooke in high diſdaine, and ſayd, he ſhall not ſcape vnpuniſhed, though he paſt mine Altars vnworſhipped, nor vaunt of his eſcape vnreuenged, if I be a Goddeſſe ile plague him and his fruits, and with that away ſhe flies: and on the next morne, ſhe ſent a huge ouer growne Beare to <hi>Oenies</hi> ground, ſuch as the like had neuer yet beene ſéene.

            <p>THis Lady for the giuers ſake was as glad in heart, as for the gift, and receiued it very thankfully: but the reſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinde that ſhee ſuch honour had, and armes diſplayd, that all the field might eaſily ſée, and heare, their murmuring diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content: <hi>Plexippus</hi> and <hi>Toxey</hi> cryed: Dame, lay downe this geare, doe we take the toyle, and thou the honour of our Game? no nor let that faire face ſmooth of thine beguile thee, leaſt he that being doted in thy loue, and giuing thee our ſée, be ouer-farre to reſcue thee: and with that word they tooke the gift away from her, and right of gift from him.</p>

            <p>This bloudy proſpect, bred ſuch a mutiny amongſt them, that their armes diſplayd on both ſides, inſomuch that the two houſes, <hi>Meleagar</hi> and <hi>Aegeus,</hi> fell into ciuill diſcenſion, and much bloud was ſpilt on both ſides: and not onely theſe two

               <hi>Meleagar</hi> walking priuately in his Garden, commenting on his Daughter <hi>Titana,</hi> brake out his paſſions in theſe tearmes; <hi>Meleagar,</hi> thou haſt but one onely Daughter, and ſhe is now about the yéeres of <hi>23.</hi> and ſhe is a Prince ſo rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deckt, and adorned with the gifts of Nature, ſo fraught with beauty and vertuous qualities, that ſhe is not onely a comfort to thee, but alſo a ioy to thy poore Commons: why then, place all thy ioy in her perfection, and fith ſhe is now marriageable, prouide her a huſband that is equiualent with her: when he had thus paſſioned a while, he ſate him downe vnder a Poomſiſherne Trée, to meditate on whom he might beſtow his Daughter <hi>Titana</hi>: till at laſt, he called to minde great <hi>Ambroſia</hi> King of <hi>Portugall,</hi> who in former time had bin brought vp togeither for the ſpace of ſeuen yéeres in Schoole: and knowing this <hi>Ambroſia</hi> to haue a Sonne, whoſe name was <hi>Piriſmus,</hi> who was faire by Natures, royall by birth, by vertues famous, and by poſſeſſions rich: preſently ſends Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors to the King of <hi>Portugall,</hi> to intreate a marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene his Daughter <hi>Titana,</hi> and his Sonne <hi>Piriſmus. Ambroſia</hi> hearing this, was excéedingly fraught with ioy, and
<pb facs="tcp:15733:11"/>
told the Embaſſadors, it was his decrée before they came, to haue ſent to their King <hi>Meleagar,</hi> concerning the ſame mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but ſith they were ſo hapily come, he told them his nauy was ready, and his Sonne <hi>Piriſmus</hi> ſhould along with them to <hi>Calidon,</hi> and if God did permit him, he would be there with them within forty dayes. The Embaſſadors hauing receiued their anſwere, and the Prince borded his Fléet, the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners hoiſted their maine ſailes, weighed anchors, and halled into the déepe.</p>
            <p>Fortune fauouring <hi>Theſeus</hi> deſtinie, opens the windowes of <hi>Aeolus,</hi> and giues them a full wind, which in a ſhort ſpace arriued them on the ſhores of <hi>Achaia,</hi> being ſo fortunately arriued, they inſtantly retired to the Court with the young Prince <hi>Piriſmus,</hi> and made report to <hi>Meleagar</hi> of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſia's</hi> anſwere, and how he had ſent his Sonne as a pledge in the meane while. When <hi>Meleagar</hi> heard that was <hi>Ambro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia's</hi> Son, hee ſéemed very angry they did not ſend him word of their comming, that he might haue receiued him in a more Prince like manner: but ſéeing it was now too late, to recall what was paſt, he ſaluted him very ſubmiſſiuely, and told him he was very ſorry he knew not of his comming, for if he had, he would haue met him by the way. Well after theſe, and ſuch like words, <hi>Meleagar</hi> takes him about the middle, and leades him into the priuy Chamber, cauſing the Nobles to attend them, whereas <hi>Titana</hi> ſate a ſowing.

After they had thus ſufficiently paſt the daye in ſumptuous feaſts, and banquets; the King gaue command he ſhould be attended on to his lodging, and all his Lords, Knights and Gentlemen, and their followers appointed their lodgings, and attended alſo: which being done and all departed, <hi>Meleagar</hi> calls for <hi>Titana,</hi> and thus brake his mind vnto her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Titana,</hi> my gray haires ſounds an alarum, and calls mee to my graue: therefore actions meaſured by time are ſeldome bitten with repentance? thou art young, and I am old, my white haires are fading bloſſomes, and thy freſh colors bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming flowers, mine preparing to die, and thine repairing to liue: therefore <hi>(Titana)</hi> I take care, and tell thee as a father

            <p>
               <hi>Titana,</hi> hearing her fathers counſaile, and marking well his words, beganne to féele which way the winde ſate, and at laſt perſwaded her ſelfe in her opinion, as this, that her father had choſen this young Prince <hi>Piriſmus</hi> to be her ſpouſe: fearing to diſpleaſe her father, yet ſwearing and vowing not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake <hi>Theſeus,</hi> made him this anſwer.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſe your Grace, to giue me leaue to ſpeake? Quoth <hi>Meleagar,</hi> we giue you free leaue.

               <hi>Meleagar</hi> hearing this vnexpected anſwer of his Daughter, and ſéeing how light ſhe accounted of Loue, began to be very hot, and chollericke, and with a frowning countenance, made her this haſty anſwer.</p>
            <p>What <hi>Titana,</hi> canſt thou not loue? why, doth the cynicall paſſion of prone deſires ouercome thee with franticke fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe, or péeuiſh peruerſeneſſe? or doſt thou thinke thy ſelfe a young <hi>Phoenix,</hi> that there is none to equall ſhee?

thee; and with that takes him about the necke, and doth ſo pay and repay him with kiſſes, that ſhée halfe ſmothers him. <hi>Theſeus</hi> heard her politicke anſwere; hearing her witty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and ſeeing her loue ſo conſtant, much commended her wit, but more pittied her griefe, deſired her to patience, and wiſhing her not to be ſo paſſionate, promiſed her that euery teare that ſhe had for him ſpent, ſhould from him returne ten thouſand ioyes againe: and quoth <hi>Theſeus</hi> I haue prouided a ſhip, and all things neceſſary for our paſſage, which lyee ready in the hauen, and if you are ready and willing, now there is a fit gate of Winde to tranſport vs from the <hi>Grecian</hi> ſhores to <hi>Tunis.</hi> Quoth <hi>Titana,</hi> my deare loue, it is the onely thing I deſire, through fire and water to follow thee ſwéet <hi>Theſeus.</hi> Quoth <hi>Theſeus,</hi> faire <hi>Titana,</hi> this night about the houre of twelue, I will come and meet thee héere, for then I hold it the beſt time to depart without ſuſpition of any, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſwéet heart make no delayes, neither for Iewels, or rich array, leſt that wee omitting this opportunity, may ſtay long for ſhe like againe, for I haue all things néedfull already prouided. <hi>Titana</hi> hearing theſe ioyfull tidings, was excéeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fraught with boundleſſe ioy, thinking that euery houre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore night came would proue a yéere, inſomuch that the time being appointed, and fearefull to bee eſpied in their priuate parley, after many louely enterchanges, and ſwéet eclipſed lips, they parted, where wée'l leaue them a while ruminating on their enſuing fortune, and turne to <hi>Piriſmus.</hi>

            <p>Who now is prouiding Robes for the Nuptiall, which I doubt will proue his funerall, yet loue being ſo vrgent with him, it caſts a miſt before the eyes of his folly, in ſo much, that he thinkes euery ſmile that <hi>Titana</hi> lends him, is a promiſe of perfection: but alaſſe poore foole, that ſuch infancy ſhould reſt in ſuch experienced yéeres: but tis not to be maruelled at, for <hi>Cupid</hi> doth greater miracles than this ſometimes, for hée forceth the bondſlaue to loue, and blinds the eies with folly: he makes the yong old, and the old become yong againe; hée cleares the ageds eyes, and make the youthfull dim: therfore
<pb facs="tcp:15733:17"/>
blame I not <hi>Piriſmus,</hi> nor yet co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend him, but as he deſerues, ſo let fortune attribute her fauours vnto him, where weele leaue him a ſpectator to his aduerſe hopes, &amp; turne to <hi>Titana.</hi>

            <p>The morne being come, and <hi>Phoebus</hi> ſaluted the day with his glorious Beames: <hi>Piriſmus</hi> ſtarts him from the imbrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his bed, to rouſe <hi>Titana</hi> from her nightly couth; hee being entred her chamber, and ſaw ſhee was ſtirring before him, and forſaken her chamber, he thus began:</p>

            <p>But yet me thinkes, I féele no hate procéed from forth their chirping blaſts, therefore ſurely thou doſt miſconceiue them: for thy loue is gone to recreate her ſelfe in the garden this freſh morne: and is eſpied by theſe louing creatures; and to adorne her and her Nuptiall, they all accord, ſtriking the ſwéet rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their conſorted tunes, to giue the Heauens an Eccho of their ioy, and thy <hi>Titana</hi> the harmonie of ſo happy a ioy.</p>
            <p>When hee had thus paſſioned a while, he was returning forth of her chamber againe, euen as he was parting, comes <hi>Meleagar,</hi> calling haſtily, for his Daughter <hi>Titana,</hi> and mée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Piriſmus,</hi> aſked him for <hi>Titana,</hi> who anſwered, ſhe was not in her chamber: <hi>Meleagar</hi> returning againe enquired, and ſent about the Court &amp; Garden to ſeeke her, but no newes could be heard of her, in ſo much that in the end <hi>Meleagar</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to feare ſome ill was betided her, and that ſhe had béene walking late, and ſo was taken by ſome of <hi>Aegeus</hi> men and kept priſoner: well this conceit tooke ſuch effect, that he ſends Embaſſadors to <hi>Aegeus</hi> Court, to demand the queſtion, if <hi>Titana</hi> were taken priſoner by any of his Souldiers, who had an anſwere no: returning againe, told <hi>Meleagar</hi> their anſwer: they had no ſooner deliuered their meſſage, but there comes a poſt from <hi>Aegeus</hi> Court, to demand if they had not taken <hi>Theſeus</hi> priſoner, the which had his anſwere deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered him in the ſame manner, no: which done, he returnes againe, <hi>Meleagar</hi>; who thought to haue feaſted, and made a triumphant Nuptiall; now caſts oft his ſumptuous Robes, and put on mourning wéedes, and inſtéed of delicious feaſting, imbraceth mournefull faſting: <hi>Piriſmus,</hi> who fed on the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

very angry with her, and beganne to goe forth of her chamber: the ſéeing no hope to obtaine loue of him, ſhe ſware ſhe would haue his life: ſhe ſteps to him againe, and thus beſets him.

the priſon, vntill the next market day: in the meane while they made ready the ſtake, and ſet it in the midſt of the market, and when the day came, according to their order, they brought him to the place of execution, where was gathered together two or thrée hundred to ſée him executed; he was ſo beloued that there was many a wéeping eie for him, and cried out to the Sheriffes, ſaying, it was a great pitty ſo braue a man ſhould die for ſo ſmall an offence: yet they could not doe withall, but cauſed him to be tied to the ſtake; which done, they layed ſtraw &amp; faggots about him, and were kindling the fire about him; yet did he ſmile and laugh on the people, and prayed them to pray for him, the which they did all very heartily he prouided himſelfe to die: euen as the fire was kindling, there came riding by a Knight of <hi>Athens</hi> by chance, as he was trauelling into <hi>France,</hi> eſpying a multitude of people, gathered together, turnes his horſe-head, and rides to the place to ſée the occaſion: when he came néere to the place, and ſéeing a man bound faſt to the ſtake, he began to looke very earneſtly on him, in ſo much that in the end, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to perſwade himſelfe that it was <hi>Theſeus</hi>: thruſts in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the people &amp; thus ſpake (Prince <hi>Theſeus) Theſeus</hi> ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly look'd vp, maruelling who it was that knew his name ſo perfectly, looking on this knight called him to mind, and anſwered, <hi>Horatio.</hi> Quoth the Knight <hi>Horatio,</hi> for ſo was his name: my Noble Liege, what make you here thus bound with chaines ſo neere your death?
