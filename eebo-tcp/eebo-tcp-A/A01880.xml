            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

flattering perſuaſions, and ſuffre her to tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne vs to wilful deſtruction. So that betwixt Cuſtome and Negligence we rather holde with damnable Ignorance, and wiſſhe to be plonged in abominable errors, then by dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſtudy and ſerching of the Trueth lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne to knowe our duetie to God, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d what he requireth of vs to do towardes our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.

God is glorified, but if God be diſhonored thy obedience is abominable in the ſight of God, be it neuer ſo beautiful in mans eyes.

Saint Peter here ſeemeth to preuent the obiection which ſeruantes (deſierous of libertie) might haue obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, being willed to obey their Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: as thoghe he would ſaye: I am not ignorant that there are many Maiſters trobleſome, frowarde, and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ouer you:<note place="margin">Of what maner of maiſters Peter ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth.</note> which are not ſo gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le and curteous towardes you as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comethe them: well: that is their faut and infirmitie, which you muſt for Chriſtes ſake, whom you profeſſe, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently ſuſtayne and beare. For thogh your Maiſters be roughe or frowarde (he ſaith not wicked and vngodly) that is no
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:3414:59"/>
cauſe why ye ſhuld not faithfully ſerue them for the tyme of your ſeruitude, ſo longe as they will nothing of you, but that which is good and godlie.</p>
            <p>Then the mynde of S. Peter is that the ſhreudneſſe or frowardnes of Maiſters, is no lawful or iuſt occaſion why the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes ſhulde be diſobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And as this is the verie meaning of the Apoſtle in that place ſo is it not like that he would write contrarie to him ſelf, when he ſayed:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 4.</note> God oght rather to be obeyed then man. Nether can he be iudged con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary to the Apoſtle Paul,<note place="margin">The true knot of obedience. Ephe. <hi>6.</hi>
               </note> who bindeth vp all lawful obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce whith this knot, In the Lorde: ſpeaking vnto childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d exhortyng the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to obeye their fathers &amp; mothers. But how? In the Lorde ſaith he. And why? For that is iuſt. Then if Paule charge not children with further obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their parentes, then in the Lorde, to whom principallie they are by Gods commandement and nature bounde, will Peter bynde ſeruantes to their Maiſters anie further the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Lor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de? And if it be iuſte obedience onlie whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ch is in the Lorde: can ther be any lawful obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce agaynſt him, either of childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>And that S. Peter had onely reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecte to the rough condicions of Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and not to their vnlawful comman<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dement agaynſt God and their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce (which they are bownde to do for no mans pleaſure) the wordes do playnelie witneſſe.

For what prayſe is it, if when ye be buf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feted for your faults, ye take it patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye? &amp;c. Then ye ſee the meanyng of S. Peter is not to make vs ſubiecte to anie euill or vngodlie comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, but to perſuade all ſeruantes not to caſt of their duetie, during the tyme of their ſeruitude,<note place="margin">S Peter ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>proueth not frowarde maiſters.</note> notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding they be roughlie dealt with all of their Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, which thing is not ſpoken here of S.

            <p>In like caſe may we conclude of Prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Magiſtrats,<note place="margin">How far wicked Princes may be obeyed.</note> thogh they be rough and frowarde: yea, thoghe before God they are wicked, vngodlie, and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate perſons (as was Saule) yet ſo longe as their wikedneſſe braſteth not out ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly agaynſt God, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his Lawes, but outwardly will ſee them obſerued and kept of others, puniſhing the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and defending the innocent: ſo lon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge are we bounde to render vnto ſuch, obedience, as to euill and roughe Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: becauſe we may not take Gods of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in hande to iudge of the harte any farther then their outwarde deedes do geue manifeſt teſtimony.

and ſubiectes reuerently obeye them without grudging or murmuring. For is there anie lawes more parfit then are the Lawes of God? Or did anie ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> better know the nature of man, then he which created man? Or anie more deſierous to keepe them in his feare, and true obedy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ence, then God him ſelf, who choſe them for his people?

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:3414:97"/>
and to keepe his preceptes and ſtatutes, which he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded them that day. And why? bycauſe (ſaithe Moyſes) he is the God of Gods, the Lorde of Lordes, the greate mightie and dreadful God, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che hath no reſpecte of perſones, nor ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth anie rewardes.

For what people is ſo great, whiche hath their God ſo friendly and familiar with them, as the Lorde our God is in all thinges that we call to him for?

            <p>Yt is then no newe doctrine which God ſo longe ago taught to the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, nor no raſhe or perelous doctrine wherby they are onely made wiſe, and moſte ſtrongly defended. Nether yet dothe it miniſter occaſion of rebellion, without which there can be no godlie peace or quietneſſe, as your experience in Englande hath all readie (as I ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe) ſufficiently taught you: who haue felt rather hellike tormentes, and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mefull confuſion, ſince ye permitted the wilde bores to caſte downe the hedge of the Lordes vinyarde, that is, his Lawes and preceptes, then anie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of godly peace, either in conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or bodies:<note place="margin">Let your owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces be Iudges in this behalfe</note> which miſerie ſhall haue no end before you reclayme with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement zele and loue, your right title and poſſeſsion of Gods Lawes, which
