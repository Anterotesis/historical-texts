         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>SInce Cuſtome obliges me to give a
Welcome at the Gate, I ſhall
not be ſo irregular, as not to
meet that common Civility, with
a fair Compliance. And though
like the paſſive Elements, I lie open to all
the Incongruity of Aſpects, of which I
have ſome reaſon to doubt, the moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull
may be found in a diſdainfull oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition;
yet, like the nobleſt of Active
Creatures (<hi>Light</hi>) I ſhall not think my
ſelf ſullied by every Vapour; nor ſollicite
his Acquaintance, that cannot ſo long ſpare
his Eyes from beholding more Active Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities.</p>
            <p>I have alwaies held it a <hi>Soloeſcim</hi> for En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainers
to be Beggers. And, although
by expoſing theſe Papers to the publick
View, I muſt conſequently expect variety
<pb facs="tcp:52159:6"/>
of <hi>Cenſures;</hi> ſhould be loath to deſcend ſo
low to court the Applauſe of every Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
from whoſe various <hi>Genii,</hi> I am ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated
to take ſuch Welcome, as Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in moſt (though Judgment in
ſo the) ſhall incline them to give. For the
firſt of which, as their <hi>Cenſures</hi> are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
ſo their <hi>Calumnies</hi> are ſmall, not of
weight ſufficient to ballance the indifferent
temper of my thoughts: But for the latter,
ſince look'd upon as competent Judges,
though their Sentence may be formidable;
I ſhall beg no further favour, then what
their Abilitie thinks fir to beſtow; only,
for what they may juſtly except againſt,
could rather wiſh that whilſt theſe <hi>Papers</hi>
were private, I had had their Advice to
reform, then now they are publiſht their
<hi>Cenſure</hi> to condemn. <hi>Fortune</hi> hath plac'd
me in too low a <hi>Sphear</hi> to be happy in the
Acquaintance of the Ages more <hi>Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Wits:</hi> Wherefore wonder not, that I
appear un-uſher'd in with a Train of <hi>Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums,</hi>
which (though I confeſs) If
from knowing and juditious Friends, they
add a Luſter to the Authors enſuing La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;
<pb facs="tcp:52159:6"/>
yet the Cuſtome of theſe Times
often makes them appear as ridiculous, as
a ſplendid and beautifull <hi>Front</hi> to an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and contemptible <hi>Cottage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have made bold with the <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick,</hi>
but have a late Example that deters
me from diſputing upon what grounds I
aſſumed it: If it ſuits not with the Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of my <hi>Pen,</hi> yet it is no un-becoming
<hi>Epithite</hi> for the Eminence of thoſe perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
in my <hi>Poem.</hi> For the place of my
<hi>Scean,</hi> manner of <hi>Compoſure,</hi> and the like;
though in <hi>Prefaces</hi> they often find an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature
Diſcovery, and perhaps, but acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
an <hi>Apetite</hi> to what, on further progreſs
may prove but a diſtaſtfull Banquet: I
hold them ſo impertinent, that if Will,
and Leaſure ſerves you to read, you may
ſuddenly with more Advantage, ſatisfie
your ſelf, if not omit them as ſtrangers to
your other Affairs, and not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
but in their own <hi>Dialect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have done with all that in probability
may prove my Readers; And now a
<pb facs="tcp:52159:7"/>
word to ſuch, whom I preſume, will be
none, for they are deſir'd to do no more
then the <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> It being fit to ſerve them
like Vagabonds, let them enter no further
then the Gate; I mean, all ſquint-ey'd
<hi>Sectaries,</hi> from the <hi>Spawn</hi> of <hi>Geneva,</hi> to
the black <hi>Brood</hi> of <hi>Amsterdam:</hi> together
