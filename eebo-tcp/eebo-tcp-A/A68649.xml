         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE common and vulgare ſorte of people (Right Honorable) are accuſtomed to eſtimate and valewe of ſuch thinges as ſhall happen to their ſight, more rather according to the credit and opinion that they haue conceyued in the authour, then for the ſubſtance or matter of that is eyther ſayde, or written.</p>
            <p>For better proofe I could alleadge ſundrie examples, but leauing many others, this fable may ſuffice (fayned by the Poetes) of the man, which by the conſent of all the goddes, was deemed for his feauture in euery proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be ſo pure and perfect, that with one generall verdite they all commended him to bee without any maner imperfection.</p>
            <p>In the ende <hi>Momus</hi> taking the vewe of this goodly perſonage, and throughly peruſing the excellencie of this creature, perceyued yet one faute which all the reſt had miſſed: which was, that there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a windowe in his breſt, through which his thoughtes might bee looked into, whereby might be ſeene what there remayned within him.</p>
            <p>Meaning that there were no man that almoſt might be founde, howe comely ſo euer he was in his perſonage, how gallantly ſo euer he went in his apparell, howe ſmoothly ſo euer he could ſpeake with his tongue, howe demurely ſo euer he ſeemed in countenance, nor howe plauſible ſo euer he appeared in his other demeanours, yet if his ſecrete thoughtes might be ſeene into, and that the priuities of his heart might be throughly conſidered of, there is no doubt, but there would be founde ſome great corruption yet remayning.</p>
            <p>If this faute had bene founde by <hi>Pallas</hi> or <hi>Apollo,</hi> queſtionleſſe it would haue bene regiſtred amongeſt the ſayinges and ſentences of the wiſe: but proceeding from him whome they rather had in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, then eſteemed in any credit, it was reputed to be but a mocke and a ſcorne.</p>
            <p>I haue here (right Honourable) raſhly and aduenterouſly taken vpon me to become a writer, wherein a great number (I knowe) will
<pb facs="tcp:16374:3"/>
likewiſe condemne me, and the rather conſidering my ſimplicitie &amp; trayning vp, which hath not bene ſo much with my penne, but more with my pyke, nor in the ſcholes amongſt learned clarkes, but rather in the fields amongſt vnletered companions, or as ſome will terme them, amongſt a company of ruſtike ſouldiers.</p>
            <p>Wherefore moſt humbly I deſire your Honour to accept of theſe my ſlender trauayles in good parte, the which I do here preſent vnto you with my ſimple ſeruice during my lyfe, to be at your Honorable diſpoſition: And although I do know both the one and the other to be to farre inſufficient to be preſented vnto you, yet though not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to mine owne deſeruing, eyther for the valew of that I haue written, yet according to your accuſtomed clemencie and goodnes, that you would vouchſafe to protect and ſhroud them with your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable countenance, whereby they may be made more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the readers, and be the better welcome to ſuch as ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe them.</p>
            <p>I do here omitte to follow the order of ſome writers, which is with great circumſtance to blaſe the vertues of ſuch as they chooſe to be patrons of their workes: for what may bee ſayde ſounding more to your aduancement, then what your ſelfe haue already gayned, whoſe noblenes hath not onely aduaunced you to ſo great honour, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in euery mans iudgement hath made you to be deemed worthie to enioye it?</p>
            <p>But I may not here omit, that amongſt other honorable roomes whereto you haue bene called, what a preſident you haue begunne, whereby our captaines of Englande may learne and gather light.</p>
            <p>I meane where her Maieſtie hath worthily appointed you to bee Captayne of a worthy bande, what care and conſideration you haue euer had, aſwell of the maners and conditions, as otherwyſe of the perſonage and abilitie of any one that you would permit, whereby her Maieſtie is guarded with a bande of men, not onely indued with actiuitie, but alſo with honeſtie.</p>
            <p>Howe much they be bound to your Honour, that was the onely meane to her Maieſtie, for the amending of their pay, whereby they are made the better able to do her ſeruice, I leaue for them ſelues to reporte, and do but onely wiſhe that our Captaynes of Englande would by your Honourable example, take ſuch light, whereby they might be made the more renowmed.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Llarmes (gentle Reader) as they are giuen vpon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe and ſundrie occaſions, ſo they are many times offred aſwel by friends as foes.</p>
            <p>By foes to further their pretences when they practiſe to deceyue: by friendes, but to ſee howe they be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and in what readines they ſtande. Who if they ſhall be negligent or vnprouided, to giue them as it were a friendly <hi>caueat,</hi> hereafter to vſe greater circumſpection and care.</p>
            <p>I haue in like maner aduentured to giue a friendly warning, the which I haue termed by the name of an <hi>Allarme,</hi> wherein, I knowe, there be a great number wil confeſſe I haue bewrayed mine owne ſimplicitie, in that I ſhould thinke to giue any <hi>Allarme</hi> to thoſe that ſtande in doubt neither of King nor Keyſer.</p>
            <p>But becauſe I would not be thought to arrogate ſo great preſumption to my ſelfe, I haue rather but vſed the parte of ſome poore bel ringer, or of ſome other inferiour perſon, that ſometymes being more afrayde then hurt, hath rong the larume bell, or hath runne through the campe in great haſte, crying, Arme, arme, arme, wherewith euery one hath runne to his furniture, and being prepared to make defence, ſeeking on euery ſide where the foe ſhould make aſſault, it hath in the ende fallen out, that the poore man was but ſtared in his owne conceyte, or elſe afrayde of ſome ſhadowe in the Mooneſhine. Now it may be likewyſe, that I am but afrayde of myne owne ſhadowe, the which if it be ſo, my ſimplicitie yet ought the rather to be borne withal, conſidering it procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of good wil that I beare to my countrey.</p>
            <p>But what excuſe might ſeeme here ſufficient, wherewith to auoyde me from ſo many quipping tauntes, which I knowe wil be pronounced againſt me, by our carping cauillers, ſuch as wil be correcting of euery mans doing? Some wil find faulte with my homely maner of inditing, and wil ſay, This is no good ſenſe, or this is no true Engliſhe, here he hath bene ſomething to tedious, and this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter asked longer circumstance, this maner of phraſe is but bad, and by this he ſhewed his eloquence was but ſmall, and here it is not well poynted, and ſo forth with many other faultes, I know not what.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I would theſe ſuperficial heades would take this for myne an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that what I haue written, it hath not bene to prooue my ſelfe artificiall or eloquent, but to ſhewe things more needfull, which I haue noted by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>
            <p>Some others there be, which are of ſuch excellent memorie, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may be written which they do not already knowe, and wil ſay, This is but borowed in ſuch a place, and this I haue read in this or in that booke.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16374:4"/>Surely I must confeſſe I haue vſed the helpe of ſundrie writers, but not of ſo many as I would haue done, if I had bene in place where I might haue come by them: for what I haue written, was onely done in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where there is no great choyce of bookes to be had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>But what then? Is this ſufficient cauſe to condemne what I haue written? is not the bee accustomed to gather out of euery flower what liketh her best, wherewith ſhe maketh hony? Or I pray you, what is the medicine the worſe, although the Phyſition be ſometimes driuen to borowe a handful of herbes out of his neighbours garden, ſhal his compoſition be any thing the vnwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomer, becauſe the ſimples were not al his owne?</p>
            <p>There is yet an other ſorte, that becauſe they thinke it a ſhame to reade o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any thing, &amp; not to be able to miniſter ſome correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe they wil not be thought to be ſo dul witted, wil finde ſome fault, if it be but with the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphie, and wil ſay, It was pitie this man would take in hande to write before he could ſpell.</p>
            <p>To theſe I anſwer, As great folly might be aſcribed to thoſe that were their bringers vp, that would learne them to goe, before they had taught them to ſpeake well.</p>
            <p>But ſuch is the delicacie of our readers at th<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

But our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey hath alwayes had that faute (and I am afrayde will neuer be without it) of being vnnaturall and vnthankfull to ſuch as with their great hazard, paynes and charges haue ſought to attayne to the knowledge of armes, by which ſhee is chiefly maintey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſuccoured and defended. To bring one example amongſt thouſands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was there of noble Gentlemen, and worthy ſouldiours, that in the dayes of that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious prince King Henry the fifth (after the honourable behauing of them ſelues, as well at <hi>Agincort,</hi> as other places, to the diſcomfiture and vtter ouerthrowe of the whole Chiualry of Fraunce) returning to their countrey, were pitifully conſtrained (&amp; which was in deede moſt miſerable) in their olde and honourable age for very want and neceſſitie to begge, whyle a great number of vnworthie wretches that lyued at home, enioyed all kindes of felicities. That Noble Gentleman Syr William Drurie a Paragon of armes at this day, was wont (I reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber) to ſay, that the ſouldiers of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland had alwaies one of theſe three endes to looke for: To be ſlayne, To begge, or To be ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged. No doubt a gentle recompence for ſuch a merit.

Such a one was ſometime Syr Thomas More, who hauing more skyll in ſealing of a writte, then ſurueying of a Campe, was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed moſt vnwiſely to write (if I may ſo ſpeake of ſo wyſe a man) that the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> labourer of Englande, taken from the plowe, was hee, that when it came to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, dyd the deede: whoſe goodly ſeruice in tyme of neede, is better knowen then I neede to ſpeake of. But what hath this Realme gayned by her ſmall accompt of ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers? Shee hath of barbarous people bene foure or fyue tymes inuaded and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunne. I pray God the ſixt be not neerer then men looke for. It is not money nor multitude of men that in extremetie preuayleth, but skyll and experience that ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mainteyneth and preſerueth. <hi>Rome,</hi> whyle ſhee maynteyned her ſouldiours, was myſtreſſe and commandreſſe of the whole world: but when ſhee fell to her owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacies, and neglecting of them, ſhe became not only a triumphe, and contempt to the

Wee haue a number of Captaynes, ſuch as neuer came yet vnder enſeigne in their life: happy ſhall that realme be, that ſhall haue neede of ſuch expert ſouldiours, but moſt vnhappy and vniuſt men that dare chalenge to them ſelues the place of ſo great a charge Souldiers ynough we haue that in time of peace can range their battailles, caſt out their ſkirmiſhes, aſſault townes, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quer king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, that a man would iudge them at the firſt ſight, for very Hectors and Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balles. But theſe be they, (I knowe not how it happeneth) that are the firſt that wil be gone, when they come to it. We haue on the other ſide, a number of good captaynes, who by their ſkilfull experience, are well able to trayne and leade a gallant companie of ſouldiours, who perceyuing their colde entertaynement, do dayly (as no man can blame them) abandon, and vtterly renounce their profeſsion, or ſerue in other places where they ſhould not. Theſe diſorders and great numbers more, your booke (if it continew according to that part that I haue ſeene) will ſufficiently lay out at large, and with his larum awake (I truſt) the mindes of thoſe, in whoſe handes it lyes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe them: whether it do or do not, your well doing deſerueth of all men to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, that haue with learned authorities, and ſufficient eloquence, done what in you lyeth to mooue it: the reſt is to be ſupplied by him, that being of that Maieſtie, vouch<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſafeth, in ſigne of his well liking of ſo noble a profeſsion, to be called by the name of <hi>Dominus exercituum,</hi> the Lord of Armies.

to defende his owne countrey: alleadging by many perſuaſions, that ayde to their neighbours was very needful and neceſſarie, when their owne ſafetie did chiefly conſiſt in the others good ſucceſſe: for who withdraweth him ſelfe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his neighbours houſe is on fyre, may wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t helpe to que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch his owne.<note place="margin">Warres ſometime attempted, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of better peace.</note> Thus we may ſee, although that peace be chiefly to be deſired, yet many times by entring into warres it is the more ſafely &amp; quietly maintayned: Like to a ſhip which many times by ſome extraordinary winde, forſaketh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quiet harbour, and ſeeketh her ſafetie in the wilde and raging ſeas.</p>

that would take thy cloke, thou muſt likewiſe giue him thy coate.

               <hi>Firſt therfore, I can conceiue no reaſon why they ſhould deſpiſe warfare when it is rightfully begunne and taken in hand in the defence of religion, whereas we ſee it wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully extold in innumerable places of holy ſcripture, which thei do not denie: but what ſay they? many things (ſay they) were conteyned in the olde law, which rather for the tymes ſake were tolerated, then worthy dewe commendation: as to make a diuorce, to take vſurie of foraine countreys, of which ſorte they ſay is to make warres vpon our enemies: but what ſemblance or ſimilitude hath either vſurie or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorces with martial affaires? for they were not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended, but tolerated becauſe of mens weakenes and imbecillitie: but he that durſt preſume not to obey, when commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was giuen to wage battell, committed an offence ſo heynous, that he could redeeme the ſame by no ſatiſfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For in what place read we that it was decreed, that he ſhuld eyther abyde a payne, or bee ſubiect to a curſe if any man (whereas after the firſt offence his wife counted it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſo to doe) did not departe from his wife, or exacted no vſurie of forriners and ſtrangers? but in many places wee haue wel noted, that men rauiſhed and repleniſhed with the holy ſpirit, haue decreed that they ſhould dye</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>death which through cowardiſe refuſed to come foorth into the fielde. But what ſhould I in this place make mention of Debora, who being inſpired with the holy ghoſt, curſeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which for as much as in them lyeth, take not in hand the warres of the Lord, and inueyeth againſt their cowardiſe in ſharpe &amp; vehement wordes? And agayne, they lay to our charges cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, the offering vp of a lambe, old ſacrifices, which were in olde tyme with great deuotion kept, and after the comming of Chriſt did want their wonted reuerence: as though warfare dyd any whit appertayne to the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and myſteries of holy things, and were not rather or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned for the preſeruation of the common wealth: for
<pb facs="tcp:16374:13"/>
thoſe holy rightes, in which were foreſhadowed the expreſſe ſignes and tokens of Iuſtice and ſaluation, to be procured by our high and mightie Sauiour Chriſt, after the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of the thing it ſelf, which was by thoſe ſignes declared, were by good right and iuſt deſert abrogated and diſanulled: but this can not be thought of the noble knowledge of feates of armes, for as much as it is not compriſed vnder the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ceremonies, but embraced for the maintenance and preſeruation of the common ſafetie, and wholy appertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to ciuill policie: and to confound thoſe thinges which are to be diſtinguiſhed, it is eyther the propertie of extreme madnes, or an argument of wonderfull temeritie and raſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. And whereas the ſtate of the common wealth can not be eſtabliſhed, but it muſt needes be ſtayde, and as it were propped vp with ſtrength and force of armes, for as much as all things in the time of peace to be practiſed and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, are vnder the tuition and defence of martiall proweſſe: he that taketh away the knowledge of feates of armes, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the ouerthrowe of the common wealth: which thing if it had happened through chriſtian diſcipline, then madde men mooued with ſome reaſon, might laye to our charge, that ſome common wealth by meanes of Chriſtian diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline was ouerthrowen: which ſlaunderous accuſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> how wicked and vayne it is, we haue afore declared. For Chriſte would not that the ſtate of ciuill policie ſhould bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen, but rather eſtabliſhed and confirmed: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as he hath not wreſted the ſword out of the hande of a Magiſtrate, ſo neyther would he haue a ſouldiour to wante his weapon, to the intent that a Magiſtrate beeing armed with authoritie of lawes, might with ſeueritie of the ſame lawes, ſuppreſſe wickednes amongſt the members and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward partes of the common wealth, and the ſouldiour clad in armour, might with dint of ſworde repelle and put aſide from the common wealth all imminent daunger. For this
<pb facs="tcp:16374:14"/>
cauſe Iohn neuer exhorted men from applying themſelues to the knowledge of feates of armes, but preſcribeth lawes vnto ſouldiours of harmeleſſe vſage, and temperat behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: And Paul calleth thoſe Magiſtrates the ſeruantes of God, which with the ſword puniſhe wicked and deſperate perſons. Truely nothing were more hartily to be deſired of a Chriſtian man, then that all men would refrayne them ſelues from wickednes and ſinfull luſt: but for as much as that can not alwayes fall out, and in ſtead of continencie, vnbrideled luſt: in ſteade of iuſtice, either forayne force or ciuill broyles vſe to ariſe: then of neceſſitie eyther force of the enemie is with weapons and maine ſtrength to be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten backe, or the outrage of our citizens with ſworde to be repreſſed. That ſay they is contrary to chriſtian charitie: as thogh any kind of crueltie were greater the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be diſſolute and negligent in a general diſtreſſe and miſerie. Chriſt hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded that we ſhuld not be reuenged of our enemies: no doubt it is the propertie of perfect and abſolute vertue, when priuately wee ſuſtayne wrongs and iniuries, to ſhewe a ſingular and wonderful patience of the minde: but when either the common wealth or ſafetie of our countrey, or the honour or eſtate of religion is impugned, then againſt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and vilanie, to take an inuincible ſtomacke. Chriſte hath eſpecially commended vs vnto peace: no doubt, that peace hee hath commended, which hee him ſelfe gaue vs, which doth not conſiſt in pleaſant reſte and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that mans nature is prone to require (for who can ſuppoſe that he hath graunted vnto vs that kinde of ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſuffered his own diſciples to be toſſed, as it were, with troubleſome waues of mans outragious furie?) but that peace, by the which we were reconciled into the grace and fauour of God, which had conceiued great wrath &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation againſt vs, and to whoſe religion our wilful appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites were moſt repugnant: theſe enimities therefore &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likings
<pb facs="tcp:16374:14"/>
betwene vs and God, Chriſt (as Paul teſtifieth in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places) with his owne preciouſe bloud hath done away, and hath purchaſed for vs a peace continual &amp; euerlaſting. The which we may then eſpecially enioy, when we moſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently and egerly fight, either for the ſafetie of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, or maintenance of the faith of Chriſt and his religion: vnleſſe peraduenture we ſuppoſe, that Abraham wanted the benefite of this peace, at what time he gathering a bande of men of his owne domeſticall ſeruants, encountered with a huge and puiſſant hoſte of his enemies, &amp; valiantly (farre exceeding the eſtimation of man) vanquiſhed foure mighty Kings, and his enemies being part of them ſlayne, the other put to the worſe, he caryed away the ſpoyle.

               <note place="margin">A fond maner of reaſoning.</note>But I do not a litle wonder, what madnes ſhould moone mens mindes to frame ſuch argumentes, that becauſe mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſpoyles, and other like hauockes be committed in the warres, the warres therefore can not pleaſe God, and what ſoeuer pleaſeth not God, can not be good.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The fruites that ſpring in the time of peace.</note>By the like argument, peace is the moſt greateſt and the moſt deteſtable enormitie that of al others may happen, and amongſt Chriſtians moſt to be abhorred: for peace is the nouriſher of vices, the roote of euils, the proppe of pride, and to be ſhort,<note place="margin">What meanes to come by riches.</note> it is the mother of al miſchiefes. For in the tyme of peace we ſet our mindes onely to waxe riche, for the attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whereof, what extortion, what deceit, what fraud, what flatterie, what lying, what forſwearing is vſed to come by them? and when they be had, they are the onely inſtruments to vanitie, the readie miniſters to vices, the very occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> why ſo great warres be many times arreared betweene Princes, a ſpecial cauſe of commotions amongſt ſubiects, they breede quarelles amongſt friendes, ſuites betweene brethren, they make him that ſhall poſſeſſe them proude, preſumptuous, vaine glorious, and of a good man to become euil &amp; wicked.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, in peace men growe to be ſlouthful, ydle, proude, couetouſe, diſſolute, incontinent, vicious, folowing al maner of vanities, giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al to delights, to inordinat luſt, glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonie, ſwearing, &amp; to be ſhort, to al maner of filthineſſe: which was very wel perceyued by <hi>S.

               <note place="margin">Auguſtine de ciuitate Dei.</note> who in a booke that he wrote intituled, <hi>De ciuitate Dei,</hi> hath theſe wordes:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>More hurtful was the citie of Carthage to Rome after her deſtruction, then during the whole courſe and ſeaſon of the warres which the Romaines had with her: for that whyleſt they had enemies in Affrike, they knewe not what vyces ment in Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what greater argument may there be of the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God, then where he ſendeth amongſt them ſuch peace and quietnes? for as the ſcriptures witneſſe, Whom he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth,
<pb facs="tcp:16374:17"/>
them he chaſtiſeth: but a ſmall ſigne of care ſhould ſeeme, where he giueth the people ouer to their owne vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſuffereth them to wallowe in all vyce and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>Thus you may ſee, by ſuch maner of reaſoning, vice may be made to ſeeme vertue,<note place="margin">Vice may be made to ſeeme vertue.</note> and contrarie vertue appeare to be vice. But here if any man would coniecture, that by this which I haue alleadged, I ment in deede to perſwade, that warres were more conuenient then peace, they ſhould doo me great wrong: for, although I do know I haue ſayde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is true, and that in the time of peace al kinde of vices do moſt wickedly abounde, yet I do very wel know, that the time of peace is not therefore to be condemned: ſo likewiſe, in the time of warre, although there be many diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and ſundrie outrages committed, yet the warres ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are not abſolutely to be reprooued. For as peace is the great benefite and bleſſing of God, ſo warres being attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon due conſideration, doe nothing at all offende him: but like as the ſunne when it ſhineth in ſome pleaſant gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, the herbes and flowers do yeelde a moſt delectable ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, ſo where it ſhineth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome filthie dunghill, the ſtench and lothſomeneſſe to the paſſers by, is moſt noyſome.</p>
            <p>As the ſunne which was prepared of the almightie God to be a comfort to euery humane thing, is not the cauſe of the one nor the other, but the qualitie of the places: ſo thoſe abuſes which are vſed either in peace or warre,<note place="margin">Leude diſpoſed people good at no ſeaſon.</note> are not to be imputed to the time, but to the diſpoſition and lewdnes of the people, which like to filthie dunghilles, at euery time and ſeaſon, are more noyſome then profitable.</p>
            <p>Let this ſuffice then: that what I haue written, is but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to prooue that warres are not alwayes to bee comdem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and that it is not agaynſt the lawes of God, that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhould erect warres vpon ſufficient cauſe, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme for ciuil policies ſake, moſt requiſite to be done: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding,

For in the time of warres, he that is founde to be bloudily minded, killing without compaſſion all that lighteth in his wrath, they tearme him by the name of a Tyrant and a murtherer, where in the time of peace, they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſhadow him vnder the title of my Lord Iudge, but many times by the name of Maiſter Iuſtice of peace and Quoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

            <p>For if it were well conſidered, what a benefite it
<pb facs="tcp:16374:25"/>
would be to the countrie, if there were a place, where gentlemen might bring vp their children in learning, where nowe they bring them vp in lewdneſſe, in fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and ſtealing: where they might be brought vp in knowledge of good artes and ſciences, in manners and ciuilitie, where nowe they remaine in ignoraunce, and be onely trayned but in brutiſh beaſtlineſſe.</p>
            <p>Neither is it much to be meruelled at, for beſides that there is no place in the countrie, where they might attaine to knowledge and learning: no more there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie one meane whereby they might almoſt knowe vice from vertue: for they are likewiſe béereued of one of the greateſt benefits, that giueth light and vnderſtanding, which is by reading of hiſtories: conſidering that there is nothing which may be either pleaſaunt, profitable, or neceſſarie for man: but is writen in books,<note place="margin">The light that reading of hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories do bring</note> wherin are reported, the manners, conditions, gouernementes, counſels, and affaires of euerie countrie: the geſtes actes, behauiour, and manner of liuing of euerie peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: the formes of ſundrie Common wealthes, with their augmentations, &amp; decayes, &amp; the occaſions ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: the precepts, exhortations, counſels, &amp; good perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions comprehended in quicke ſentences: to conclude, in bookes and hiſtories are actually expreſſed, the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of vertue, and the lothſomnes of vice.

A proude man clothed in ſumptuous or coſtly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray, it maketh him the more proud and hautie in his mind: or a whore that is bedect in light and gariſh ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, it maketh her in her mind to be the more who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe. And like as a foole is not in his right kind with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a yellowe coate, ſo fonde or vndecent apparell, may ſomtimes confuſe the wiſeſt heads. As to ſée a learned preacher go into a pulpit pretending to make ſome ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne ſermon, appareled like ſome luſtie courtier, it woulde not onely bréede laughter to his audience, but it woulde likewiſe ſo amaſe him in his owne conceipte, that it woulde be a greate let to the tale that he ment to tell. And like as <hi>Semiramis,</hi> when ſhée gouerned the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> tooke on her y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> habit of a man, the better to ſhewe her manly courage: and as <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed himſelfe into womanes attyre, the more liuely to expreſſe his effeminate minde: ſo I am of this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that theſe Iriſh do the rather deſire this rogiſh ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of apparel, becauſe it is moſt ſutable and beſt agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their conditions: neither were it amiſſe if by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion they were reſtrained from it as much as conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently it might be.</p>
            <p>I doe heere ouer paſſe many other abuſes, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will I ſpeake of an infinite number of priuie practiſes, that are ſometimes vſed in the Superla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue degrée, you may chooſe howe you will conſtrue it, either to ſome of thoſe that are of noble parentage in the countrie, and gentlemen that bee of the greateſt credite, and woulde be accompted the beſt Subiectes: either elſe to the number of their ſlye deuiſes whiche in déede dothe excéede in the higheſt degree, but ſome times rather then faile, you may
<pb facs="tcp:16374:27"/>
conſtrue it both for the one and the other, ſo expert they be in deuiſing of trecherie, and in the mainteining and relieuing of rebelles, and that by ſo many meanes and ſuch ſundrie ſhiftes, as it paſſeth my conceipt, neither will I take vppon mée to diſcipher. But theſe matters cannot be proued, and therefore may the eaſilier paſſe: but I cannot ſée almoſte howe it is poſſible, that any thing ſhould be proued that ſhould make againſt them, for there are verie fewe amongeſt them that will make any conſcience to forſweare them ſelues vppon a booke: but if <hi>Ananias,</hi> with <hi>Saphira</hi> his wife, receiued bothe death,<note place="margin">Actes. 5.</note> but for denying of that portion which was their owne, what puniſhment could be ſufficient for theſe people, that will ſo ordinarily denie GOD, and that almoſt for euery trifle?</p>
            <p>And here, (I knowe,) I ſhall offende the patience of a great number, for that they finde mée ſtill in one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſonge, and woulde exact nothing but puniſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, and ſharpe corrections vppon them: but I truſt I ſhall not offende thoſe that be good and honeſt, conſidering that my penne doeth not in any reſpecte touche them. And I knowe there are in the countrie many honourable houſes, as the houſes of <hi>Ormunde</hi> and <hi>Kyldare,</hi> the Lorde of <hi>Doluin,</hi> the Lorde of <hi>Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſore,</hi> the Lorde of <hi>Louthe,</hi> with many other (though not expreſſed by name) both honourable and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and others of inferiour calling, that may not any wayes be detected with any thing that I haue written. So I knowe likewiſe, that there be a great number, of ſuch as I haue ſpoken of, that are not to be reformed, but by moſte bitter and ſharpe puniſhmentes in déede: for the better triall, howe long time haue they béene gouerned by ſundrie noble Princes, but nowe laſtly,
<pb facs="tcp:16374:27"/>
and eſpecially, by a moſte gratious Quéene, who of her greate mercie and clemencie, ſpendeth not onely ſuch reuenues as riſe by the countrie it ſelfe: but alſo addeth no ſmall portion out of her owne purſſe, onely to kéepe the countrie in quietneſſe if it might be: which otherwiſe would be at ſtrife and warres in it ſelfe, the one killing and murthering the other, as it daily fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out notwithſtanding: and with no leſſe care, ſhée prouideth for them good &amp; wholſome lawes and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, where of them ſelues they would rather liue like beaſtes, voide of lawe and all good order: where other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if her maieſtie pretended to rule by rigour ouer them, who knoweth not that ſhée coulde ſende ſuche a power ouer into <hi>Irelande,</hi> as in verie ſhorte ſpace, would make quicke riddaunce of all that ragged rowt, which nowe ſo vexeth and moleſteth the countrie: but ſhée rather ſéeketh w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> mercie to reclaime them, and with lenitie to reforme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſending them ouer from time to time, ſuch gouernors to direct them, as are neither founde to be rigorous, cruell, nor mercileſſe. But how muche is the countrie bounde to her Maieſtie at this preſent, in ſending that noble gentleman, Sir <hi>Henrie Sidney,</hi> to be their gouernour, the onely man that they themſelues haue ſo muche deſired, and ſo long time wiſhed for: whoſe onely carke and care, hath béene to ſéeke the countries Common wealth, and the qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe of the people. And with what humanitie and gentleneſſe, hath he ſtill continued his gouernement: what pittie and mercie hath he from time to time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to thoſe that little deſerue it: conſidering with what treaſon, with what trecherie, with what fraude, and with what deceipt, they requite him? There is no hope of their promiſe, no holde of their worde, no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
<pb facs="tcp:16374:28"/>
in their othe, nor no trueth in their dealings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes him.</p>
            <p>Therefore, to conclude as I began at the firſt, there néedes no longer circumſtaunce, nor better triall to proue, that courteſie in the Iriſhe gouernement, is not the readieſt way to winne: but onely by ſeuere iuſtice without mercie, to him that ſhall offende: for this hope of forgiueneſſe is the onely marring of all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Thus farre I haue ſpoken partly by report, and as it were by <hi>vox populi</hi>: but if <hi>vox populi</hi> be <hi>vox Dei,</hi> as ſome will affirme, it is not onely the Iriſhe alone, that altogether confuſeth the gouernement, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there is falſhood in fellowſhip played amongeſt the Engliſh: but let him that is guiltie accuſe him ſelfe: I ſpeake but by report. And ſéeing I am entred into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portes, I will not let to make report howe a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do reporte, that ſome of thoſe that be ſent ouer, to be ayders and aſſiſtaunts to the gouernement, and ſuche as ſhould helpe to boult out ſuch matters, haue greater care to ſéeke their owne gaine, and to make them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues riche: yea, and ſo they may be rewarded with a bribe, will rather ſéeke to helpe couer and cloake ſuche cauſes, then to giue their conſentes to puniſhe them: ſuch is the effect of this filthie vice couetouſneſſe,<note place="margin">The effect of couetouſneſſe.</note> that when it once inrageth the mindes of men, it draweth from them all feare, religion, loue, reuerence, and knowledge of GOD: it peruerteth iuſtice and true dealing towardes men: and he that thirſteth onely for gaine, of force muſt runne into actions of iniuries and oppreſſions.</p>
            <p>And nowe to ſhewe what reportes runnes amongſt the miniſters of the lawes, whereof ſome be Engliſhe,
<pb facs="tcp:16374:28"/>
and ſome be Iriſhe.</p>
            <p>The Iriſhe (they ſaye) fauour no Engliſhe mennes cauſes, but foades them off with further delayes then may well ſtand with lawe or reaſon. The Engliſhe yet be founde to be moſt indifferent, for they reſpect no countries, but fauour his cauſe that hath moſte money to bribe them: ſuch parcialitie there is vſed amongeſt them, and ſo farre they be eſtraunged from pietie and iuſtice, that the miſerable poore oppreſſed people, doe holde it leſſe euill to ſuffer their iniuries, then to pleade their ſuites, before ſuch as haue greater regarde to the brybes that are giuen them, then eyther to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie or innocencie of their cauſes.</p>
            <p>Thus, I haue not thought it good, with ſecret ſilence to diſſemble and ſmother inwardly in my minde, what I haue heard: conſidering, that men ought rather to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téeme the wordes of him that telleth the trueth with ſimplicitie, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſmooth ſpéeches of him that ſpeaketh all to currie fauour, and yet in déede ſaye nothing that is worthie of commendation.</p>
            <p>And thus, wiſhing to <hi>Irelande</hi> as good ſucceſſe, as he that was borne in the countrie, I returne to my firſt purpoſe to ſpeake againe of Souldiers: neyther ſhall I néede ſpende any longer time, in that I preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to proue: that to become Souldiers, or warfaring men, is no profeſſion for thoſe that be honeſt: conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that there is alreadie ſufficiently ſaid,<note place="margin">The Souldiers of England in moſt miſerable eſtate.</note> to thoſe that be reaſonable. Wherefore nowe I will direct my tale to the poore Souldiers of <hi>Englande,</hi> whoſe number as it is verie ſmall, ſo their caſe is likewiſe moſt miſerable, if it be well conſidered.</p>
            <p>Firſt in the time of warres, they ſpare not in their countries behalfe, to forſake their wife, childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, father,

            <p>I wonder if <hi>Diogenes</hi> were nowe liuing, and going into <hi>England,</hi> whither he would ſay he were going, if he were demaunded: where we be wholie nouſeled in wantonneſſe, and onely nouriſhed in deintineſſe, both in minde, manners, and dyet: where we be altogether made ſtraungers to Martiall actions, and vtterly alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from lawes, and déedes of armes, where no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration is had of Martiall mindes: where prouiſion for defence is neuer called in queſtion.</p>
            <p>Here peraduenture, ſome will ſay vnto mée, Good ſir, if you would but put on your ſpectacles, and looke into the Tower of London, you might ſée that neyther ordinaunce, ſhott, poulder, pike, caliuer, armour, nor any other furnitures conuenient for the warres were any whit lacking: from thence, if it pleaſed you but to ſayle downe in Graueſend Barge, you haue but fiue myles to Rocheſter, where you might likewiſe take y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> view of ſo worthie a fleete of royall ſhips, as no Prince in <hi>Europe</hi> may make compariſon with the like.

            <p>Verie true in déede, which doth argue the ſpeciall care her Maieſtie hath euer had, not onely in making of ſuch prouiſion, but alſo at ſundrie times, ſhée hath like<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wiſe inſtituted diuerſe good ordinaunces for the tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of men, the which hath béene ſtill diſcontinued, by her ſubiectes, ſuch as will pyne at the ſpending of one pound of poulder towardes the practiſing of thoſe that ſhould fight for their ſafetie.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:16374:37"/>
Their Gallies and their Peere are but trifles and toyes vnto mee: For what account is to be made of thoſe fellowes that giue themſelues to daunſing, hoyting, banquetting, and to bellie cheere, that if Demoſthenes onely were not amongeſt them, I would ſooner gett A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens then Thebes, or Theſſalia, &amp;c.</hi> So, to what effect ſerue all theſe warrelike furnitures, where there are not men experienced to vſe them: &amp; where men be tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned onely in pleaſure, howe vnapt be they to indure the perplexities of warre: and howe hardly are they faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the vſe of weapons, that neuer haue had any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe in them: and with what difficultie are they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the field, when they haue neuer béene accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to marche?</p>
            <p>But I haue hearde many ſay, that ſouldiers may well be trayned in one moneth, and made fit for the warres: and in déede I am of this opinion, that he that in one moneth wil not learne the vſe of his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, whereto he ſhall be ſorted, and to learne to marche in order of array, being throughly inſtructed by a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and painefull Capteine, I am fully reſolued, that that man will neuer make good ſouldier. But as our Souldiers in <hi>Englande</hi> are acuſtomably leuied, a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine ſhall haue muche to doe, to make a greate parte of them for euer being Souldiers at all.</p>
            <p>But admitte, that Souldiers may be trained and made readie in one moneth, yet during that ſpace, our enimies would committ greater ſpoiles vppon vs, then wee ſhould be able to recouer againe in ſixe wéekes after.</p>
            <p>Moreouer in the day of ſeruice, I had rather haue one thouſande ſuch as haue alreadie ſéene and entred ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhe with the enimie, then foure thouſande of ſuch ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie mad Souldiers, that are but trained vp, as it were

at a Midſummer ſight, or at the fetching home of a Maypole. For proofe hereof, I could ſhewe many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, but it were but in vaine, conſidering there is no man of reaſon, but will conceiue it to be true: and ſuch as haue experience will confeſſe I am nothing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in my opinion.</p>
            <p>And to ſaye the trueth, if in <hi>Englande</hi> we ſhoulde haue néede to vſe any reaſonable number, there woulde hardly be founde conductors, ſuch as be ſufficient in déede for the training of them.</p>
            <p>For Gentlemen that are deſcended of honourable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, in theſe dayes, giue themſelues rather to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Battalus</hi> knightes,<note place="margin">Battalus an effeminate man.</note> then Martiall wights, &amp; haue greater deſire to be practiſed in Carpet trade, then in that kinde of vertue, which extendeth it ſelfe to the common profite, and preſeruation of the countrie.</p>

            <p>Likewiſe, when <hi>Lucius Pius,</hi> in a banquet that hee

               <hi>I can not denie the glorie I haue gained by this bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, neither may I hide the perplexitie I feele for thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent miſfortune: for noble mindes are bound to ſhew no leſſe compaſſion, to ſuch as are ſubdued, then to expreſſe ioy &amp; gladneſſe with thoſe that are victors. Thou being the chiefe of the Parthies, dideſt ſhewe great courage to reſiſt, &amp; in me the leader of the Romanes, was found no want of force to fight: notwithſtanding, though thou loſt the battell, and I remaine poſſeſſed of the victorie, yet as I know, that thou wilt not acknowlege this cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to happen for any want of ſtomache in thee, ſo it belongs to my grauitie not to attribute it altogether to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of my vertue, ſithens God doth always miniſter vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, not to ſuch as doe their duties beſt, but to thoſe that he loueth moſt: for the effect of al things depending vpon God, man can haue no power to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinie of a battell, ſeing he is not able to ſtay the courſe of the leaſt planet in heauen. Darius againſt Alexander, Pompeius againſt Caeſar, Hanibal againſt Scipio, had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all equalitie, far greater armies then their enimies, by whiche thou haſt reaſon to conclude with mee, that againſt the anger of the ſouereigne God, can not preuaile moſt huge and mightie hoaſtes. I meruell Popilio, that being great in birth, valiant of ſtomach, welthy in goods and mightie in eſtate &amp; dignitie, why thou beareſt with ſuch ſorow, the loſſe of this batel, ſeing that in no world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things fortune is more vncerteine and variable, then in the action of warre. It is tolde me, thou draweſt to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie corners, &amp; ſeekeſt out ſhaded places, thou eſche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt the conuerſation of men, and complaineſt of the gods, which extreme perplexities, ſince thou wert not wont to ſuffer in others much leſſe oughteſt thou to giue place in thy ſelfe: for that the valiant man, loſeth no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, for that fortune fayleth him, but is the leſſe

eſteemed of, if he want diſcretion to beare her mutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To aſſemble great armies, is the office of Princes, to leuie huge treaſures, belongs to ſouereigne Magiſtrates, to ſtrike the enimie is the parte of a couragious capteine: but to ſuffer infirmities and to diſſemble miſhaps, is a propertie duely annexed to noble and reſolute mindes: ſo that one of the greateſt vertues that worldly men can expreſſe, in the common behauiour of this life, is neither to riſe proude by proſperitie, nor to fall into deſpaire by aduerſitie. For Fortune hauing a free will, to come and goe when ſhee liſt: the wiſe man ought not to bee ſorie to loſe her, nor reioyce to hold her. Such as in their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie ſhewe heauie countenaunce, doe well proue, that they made accompt to be alwayes in proſperitie, which is a great folly to thinke, and no leſſe ſimplicitie to hope for: Seing the giftes and graces of Fortune haue no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thing more certeine in them, then to be for the moſte part, in all things moſt vncerteine, according to the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of the day, wherein thou gaueſt mee battell: for there thou orderedſt thy campe according to a wiſe cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine, madeſt choiſe of the place, in great policie, tookeſt aduauntage of the ſunne, as a leader of long experience, in conſideration of which things, thou haſt cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine againſt thy fortune, which fauoured not thy ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and not blame thy diſcretion, wherein could bee found no errour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſider that in wiſe and graue men, it is an office, that if they cannot doe what they will, at the leaſt they yeld to time, and are content with what they may. And as the vertuous and valiant minde, ought not to grieue for not obteining that which he woulde, but becauſe he deſired that which he ought not: ſo Popilio, I wiſh thee take heede, that the honour which ſo many times thou
<pb facs="tcp:16374:44"/>
haſt wonn, with the hazard of thy valiant perſon, in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes of warre, be not loſt at this preſent, for want of bearing well thy fortune: aſſuring thee, that he beares his miſerie beſt, that hides it moſt. And as of all voluble things, there is nothing more light then renowme: ſo in caſes of warre and hazarde, it is not ynough for the valiant man to do what he may, but alſo he is bound to attempt nothing but what he ought: for aſwell the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration as the execution of a fact, belonges duely to a diſcreete minde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I heare thou wandereſt here and there in great vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teintie of minde, fearing that if thou be taken of my ſouldiers thou ſhalt be euill intreated of mee, which if no man haue tolde thee, it is againſt reaſon thou beleeue it of thy ſelfe, becauſe to vs Princes of Rome, it is famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar to ſhewe our liberalitie to ſuch as yeld to vs, &amp; with others that are our priſoners to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate in great cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie. We raiſe armies againſt campes proudly furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and Cities ſtrongly walled, but to captiues in thy condition, we hold it more honourable to miniſter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort then to add increaſe of affliction. For as it ſufficeth the valiant Capteine to fight againſt the enimie that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth him, and diſſemble with him that flyeth: ſo the wiſe man ought to require no more of his enimie, then that he acknowledge that hee ſtandes in feare of him, becauſe to a daunted and timorous heart, is ſildome lefte courage to renue an enterpriſe. And therefore a man ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes greater reuenge, when he putteth his enimie to flight, then if he take his life from him. For the ſworde diſpatcheth a man in a day, but feare and remorſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes the minde continually. And better it were to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer without feare that which we expect in griefe and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe, then by feare to be alwayes in martyrdome. It is right terrible to fleſhe and bloud to dye of a ſworde, but
<pb facs="tcp:16374:45"/>
to be in perpetuall ſorrowe and diſquiet of mind, is the verie furie and torment of hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If thou eſcheweſt my preſence, in feare that I wil not vſe pittie to thee, thou art abuſed in the opinion of my diſpoſition, and doſt wrong to the reputation and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of my actions paſt. For I neuer refuſed to ſhewe mercie to him that aſked it, &amp; much leſſe deceiued him that put his truſt in mee. The doubt and feare that thus do trauell thy mind, ought not to be ſo much of my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as of the cuſtome of fortune, who vſeth not to vnloſe her ſharp arrowes with better wil againſt any then ſuch, as think they be in beſt ſecuritie of her: her nature being ſuch, as not to meddle with thoſe that ſhee findes prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the better to aſſure them, but followeth the fearfull &amp; negligent, to the end to deceiue them: yea, ſhe preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les euen ouer the counſels and actions of men, and being exempt to make reckoning to any, her prerogatiue is to require accompt of all men. I aſſure thee Popilio, that more do I feare the reuolution of Fortune at this houre, then I doubted her before the battell. For ſhee delightes not ſo much to keepe vnder the vanquiſhed, as to bridle and checke the victors. And worſſe doeth ſhee meane, when ſhee ſmiles the faireſt, then when ſhee frownes moſte. But to ſpeake on thy behalfe, I tell thee that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out daunger thou maiſt reſort to my preſence, ſince in thy eſtate is no cauſe of ſuſpicion, and in my hearte no malice to thy perſon: for in deede, that cannot be called true victorie, which bringeth not with it ſome clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. And therefore he cannot be called victorious, in whome reſteth intent of rigour and crueltie. For, Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, Iulius Auguſtus, Titus, and Traianus, wonne more renowme by the clemencie they vſed to their eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, then by all the victories they obteined in ſtraunge regions. To obteine a victorie is a thing naturall &amp; hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,
<pb facs="tcp:16374:45"/>
but to giue pardon and life, is the gifte and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God. By which it comes to paſſe, that men feare not ſo much the greatneſſe of the immortall God, for the puniſhments he doth, as for the mercie he vſeth. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtanding as I cannot denie, but that great is the value &amp; eſtimation, which we Romane Princes make of a victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie wonne by battell: ſo alſo I aſſure thee, wee holde it more honourable, to pardon ſuch as do offend vs, then to chaſtice thoſe that do reſiſt our power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore, if thou flye from my preſence as fearing the iuſtice which I haue executed vpon the Romanes, thou oughteſt to take ſecuritie and courage euen in that whiche makes thee gelous and doubtfull: for ſo muche greater ought to be clemencie, by howe much the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is in fault. And therefore as there is no offence which cannot be either forgiuen or fauoured, ſo right worthily may that pardon be called honourable and famous, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is giuen to an iniurie malicious and manifeſt, ſince all other common and light wrongs with greater reaſon we may ſay we diſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble them, then that we pardon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The thing that moſte drawes mee to enter friendſhip with thee, is for that in our firſt capitulations and truce, thou perfourmedſt all thinges that were concluded for the peace, and yet in the battell thou dideſt expreſſe the partes of a valiant Capteine, the ſame giuing me cauſe to beleeue, that as in warre I founde thee a iuſt enimie, ſo in the time of peace, thou wouldeſt proue an aſſured friend. Alexander neuer repented the pardon he gaue to Diomedes the tyraunt, nor Marcus Antonius the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour he ſhewed to the great Orator Cicero. Neither ſhall I haue cauſe (I hope) to forethink the reſpite I giue to thy life. For the noble mind, albeit he may haue occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to be ſorie for the vnthankefulnes of his friend: yet hath he no lice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to repent him of his good turns done
<pb facs="tcp:16374:46"/>
for him: &amp; therfore, in the caſe of liberalitie or clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, by howe much the perſon is vnworthy that recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the benefite, by ſo much more he is to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that beſtoweth it: for that onely may bee ſaide is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, when he that giueth, giueth without reſpect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>So that he that giueth in hope of recompenſe, deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not to be called liberall, but to pretend vſurie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou knoweſt well that in the time of the battel, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the incounter was moſt hot, I offered thee nothing worthy of reproch: euen ſo, thou haſt now to iudge, that if in the furie of the warre, thou foundeſt me faithfull, and mercifull, I haue nowe no reaſon, to exerciſe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, holding thee within the precinct of my houſe: ſo that if thou ſawe mercie in mee at that inſtant, when thy handes were buſie to ſpill my bloude, thinke not that my clemencie ſhal faile, calling thee to the fellowſhip of my table.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The priſoners of thy camp, can aſſure thee of my dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, amongeſt whom the hurt are cured at my charges, &amp; the deade are buried according to the place of ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: wherein if I extend this care vppon ſuch as ſought to ſpoile me, thinke there is farre greater plentie of grace, to thee that comeſt to ſerue me. And ſo leauing thee in the handes of thine owne counſell, I wiſhe thee thoſe felicities, which thy honourable hearte deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Loe her a mirrour, méete to be peruſed by kinges and princes, wherein they may learne, with what conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration they ſhould firſt enter into warres, with what valiaunce and courage they ſhoulde proſequute them, and with what iuſtice, temperaunce, and mercie, they ſhould vſe their enimies.</p>
            <p>Capteines may likewiſe learne how to vſe fortune, either when ſhe fauours, either when ſhée frownes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16374:46"/>But leauing a great number of neceſſarie leſſons, worthie to be noted, howe is it poſible in ſo fewe lines, more amply to deſcribe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glorie of the <hi>Romanes</hi>: neither are their vertues here ſo liuely painted forth in words, as they them ſelues, did nobly ſhewe it in their déedes.</p>
            <p>But all other examples of humanitie, amongeſt a great number vſed to their enimies, this in my opinion deſerueth not the leaſt commendation, that hauing ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Siphax</hi> king of <hi>Numantia,</hi> who being kept priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the houſe of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> died of ſickneſſe before he was ranſomed, notwithſtanding now when there was no maner of hope of requitall, his funeralles were yet perfourmed, with ſuch ſolemnitie, ſuche pompe, and ſuch honor, ſuch large giftes were giuen, &amp; ſuch libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie vſed, being but a <hi>Romane</hi> priſoner, as might haue wanted at <hi>Numantia,</hi> where he was Lord and King o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all. I haue thus farre briefely, and in this ſhort manner, ſhewed ſome ſmall part of the magnificence of the <hi>Romans,</hi> in their Martiall actions, whereby may be perceiued, howe farre we be digreſſed, and how cleane we be degenerate at this preſent,<note place="margin">Princes more deſireous with tyranie to offend others, then with iuſtice to keepe their owne.</note> from their honorable inſtitutions. For if we conſider in theſe dayes, the impietie that is founde amongeſt Princes, whiche for the moſt part are ſo led by the furie of ambition, where they thinke they may oppreſſe, that without any other reſpect of cauſe they are redy to accompanie themſelues, with a ſort of bloudie capteines, that ſhoulde haue the leading of a companie of as lewd and vngratious ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and euen according to their quarelles and to the qualitie of their owne diſpoſitions, they proſecute their warres, and performe all their enterpriſes, the whiche for the moſt part are executed with ſuch treaſon, and trecherie, as no Prince almoſt may be ſo ſurely garded, but his life ſhalbe finiſhed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſome deadly blowe with a

place, by whiche meanes the paſſage by lande ſhoulde haue béen quite cut off, that no victuals could haue come to the campe by lande: and by ſea it was as well gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, with the Princes ſhippes.

               </gap> haue fallen to fortifying, and to haue made them ſelues ſtrong: the one of the companies, perſuaded by two or thrée <hi>Duche</hi> capteines, which were amongeſt them (as there was in the companie both <hi>Engliſhe, French, Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan, Scotiſhe,</hi> and <hi>Duche</hi>) woulde néedes goe charge certeine <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whiche did lie hard by them, in a ſtreight they had made: although there were ſome that foreſawe what daunger might inſue, of this pretence, yet they woulde vſe no diſſuaſions, bicauſe it woulde haue béene coniectured, that it had rather procéeded of want of courage, then for any other thing. There was no delay in the matter, but the charge was giuen with courage ynough, but ſo muche to their coſtes, as the Spaniards at that charge, ouerthrew the greateſt part of their beſt and principal men. I wil not ſay they were <hi>Engliſhe</hi> men, becauſe I haue tearmed them the beſt and principall men. I might be thought to ſpeake par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially. But yet the matter being ſo lately done, and ſo well knowen, I néede not doubte to tell the trueth, they were <hi>Engliſhe</hi> men in déed, that receiued the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ouerthrowe: for howe coulde it otherwiſe fall out, they were the formeſt that were in the fray: nowe the Spaniards perceiuing what ſpoyle they had giuen, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the chace of the reſt, killing and ſpoyling of them as they retired, til they were come to a ſlender ſtrength, that was caſt vp, whiche the Spaniardes had entred, had it not béene valiauntly defended, by the reſt of the Engliſhe men that were left, who in the ende, as the
<pb facs="tcp:16374:50"/>
Spaniardes did retire, couragiouſly purſued them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to their owne ſtrength. By this fooliſhe attempt, this companie was made ſo weake and ſo féeble, that they were driuen to forſake the ground, and to get them againe aborde of their ſhippes, and the Spaniards ſent preſently thither a freſh ſupply of men, by which mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes the Prince could neuer get the like opportunitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. The other companie kepte the ſtrength fiue or ſixe dayes, in the end gaue it ouer, and came away: for that it was to ſmall purpoſe, conſidering the loſſe of the firſt. There were manie like parts played in thoſe <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſeruices, where I thinke as litle Martial diſcipline was vſed, as in any warres that euer were attempted: Neither had it béene poſſible that the countrie coulde ſo long haue holden out, but that it was by nature ſeated ſo ſtrong: for they might ſo drowne the countrie about them, that it was not poſſible that any enimie ſhoulde conquer them. The Prince him ſelfe was verie wiſe &amp; politike in all his directions, but many times they had but vnhappie ſucceſſe, by the raſhneſſe of ſome of his Capteines, which onely did procéede for want of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. For many of them were choſen after the Engliſh manner, I meane they had little knowledge, what them ſelues ought to do, &amp; leſſe experience howe to rule their ſouldiers. But leauing <hi>Holland</hi> cauſes, &amp; to returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to the examples of the Romanes, who I ſay were verie ſeuere in the puniſhing of thoſe offences,<note place="margin">The Romanes vſed to adioyne the authoritie of God to their owne preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the better to keepe their ſouldiers in awe.</note> &amp; the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to kéepe their ſouldiers vnder awe &amp; diſcipline, they adioyned to their owne lawes &amp; ordinances, the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of God, and vſed with greate ceremonies to make them ſweare to kéepe the diſciplines of warre. <hi>Cicero</hi> maketh mention howe <hi>Pompilius,</hi> when he was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the Romanes in the Perſian warres, had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged one legion, in the which <hi>Catoes</hi> ſonne had ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

            <p>But eſpecially by this example, both of the Romans and Grecians, may verie well be coniectured, that as they had ſuch conſideration to ſwear their ſouldiers, &amp; men of warre, they would vſe the like reſpect and care, in the chooſing of ſuch as had regarde of their oth, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe as good vnſworne, as to miniſter an othe vnto ſuch as care not to be foreſworne.

<pb facs="tcp:16374:52"/>
had ſought ſundrie meanes to haue ſurrendered them ſelues vnto the Spaniardes.</p>
            <p>The Prince was then in <hi>Zeland,</hi> in the Iſle which is called by the name of <hi>Waulkerland,</hi> which is the Iſle wherein <hi>Middleborough, Fluſhing, Camphyre,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mue</hi> are ſeated, and there it was thought he would haue remained, they neuer looked for him more in <hi>Holland.</hi> And while the Hollanders were thus in the middeſt of their dumps, liſtening euer when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Spaniardes ſhould haue taken y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Plaate Iſland, which was hard adioyning vppon <hi>Zurickzeas,</hi> wherein laye a fewe faint bandes (God knowes) to ſmall purpoſe: From thence the <hi>Bryel Iſland</hi> was nexte adioyning, the which coulde not haue béene defended, if the Spaniardes had once béene com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunders of the Plaate. The firſte thing the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes would there haue ſought for, ſhould haue béen the <hi>Bryel</hi> head, which is nowe verie ſtrongly fortified, but at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inſtant nothing begun: which if they had once take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>Holland</hi> had béene no longer able to haue holden out, for their trade by ſea would haue béene ſoudeinly cutte off, without the which they may not endure, conſidering it is the onely wealth of all their townes, that are to bée accompted of, as <hi>Skeydame, Delftes</hi> hauen, <hi>Roterdame, Delfte, Dorte, Gorcom,</hi> all theſe with many other, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vppon the riuer called the <hi>Maaſe,</hi> would haue béen ſhut vp, that they ſhould haue had no traffike or paſſage to the ſea.</p>
            <p>Thus (as I ſaide) as the Hollanders were in theſe muſes, coniecturing with themſelues, that this (in déede) was the marke which the Spaniardes ſhotte at, neither wiſt they howe to preuent it: for the taking of <hi>Zurickzeas</hi> had ſo quailed their courages, &amp; nowe their malice and their money was wel nigh ſpent, that they were hardly able to pay thoſe ſouldiers they had retei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
<pb facs="tcp:16374:53"/>
In ſo much that a great number of them were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding what they were able to make, to packe them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England.</hi> But in the middeſt of this perplexitie, and when they were moſte amazed with this terrour, the Spaniardes which were entred <hi>Zurickzeas</hi> fel in a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinie amongeſt them ſelues for a paye which had béene of long time behinde, proteſting that they would neuer proſecute further ſeruice, before they were paide: thus they diſcontinued ſeruice, forſaking ſo good occaſion, which euen then had happened vnto them. In the ende, hauing layd a platte amongeſt them ſelues, for the paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of theſe matters, all their practiſes were laide o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and manifeſt, by letters which were intercepted, by thoſe of <hi>Bridges,</hi> whereby <hi>Flaunders</hi> and <hi>Brabant,</hi> preſently put them ſelues in armes againſt them, and were nowe of friends become mortal enimies: by which meanes the Spaniardes were driuen to drawe them ſelues from all partes into one maine ſtrength. The Prince of <hi>Orenge</hi> in the meane while, forſlowed no time, but he recouered <hi>Zurickzeas</hi> againe, with <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam, Vtricke, Sconehouen, Hardame,</hi> with diuerſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther townes in <hi>Holand,</hi> which before were in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions of the Spaniards, the ſequele of the matter is ſo well kn<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
