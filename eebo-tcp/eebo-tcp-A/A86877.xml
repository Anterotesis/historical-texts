         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N that ſtrange Pamphlet which I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from you yeſterday, you cannot marvell if I ſtartled to meet ſo inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectly with the name of Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> diſgracefully ranked with Prieſts and Jeſuites, and the man that was executed the other day. (for ſo it hath pleaſed my unknown Accuſer, in his great charity, to range my unworthineſſe.) If my pale and wrinkled cheeks could be any whit capable of the tincture of ſhame, you may well think what change of countenance theſe words muſt needs have wrought in me. Lord, (thought I) what ſo hainous crime is this, for which I am thus ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully arraigned before all the world, now on the brink of my grave! Forſooth, Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> (as the reſt of thoſe meet complices) ſaith, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a true Church. [<hi>Grave crimen Caie Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar.</hi>]
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:167993:5"/>
What an impotent malice is this, to ſingle out my name thus ignominiouſly, from all the reſt of my profeſsion, for an odious Paradox; when I ſay no more, no other herein, then all the Orthodox Divines of Chriſtendome? How muſt the reader now needs think, Sure this Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> is a man of corrupt principles, ſingular for his dangerous miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opinions, a greater friend to <hi>Rome</hi> then all his fellows? whenas the world knows that I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, about 28 yeares ago, clearly vindicated my ſelf from this groſſe miſconſtruction, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that, in my ſenſe, there is no knowing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Divine that agrees not fully with me. You remember that about the time mentioned, when, upon ſome paſſages of the Old Religion, then publiſhed by me, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Burton</hi> and ſome others boggled at that expreſſion; namely, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is yet a true viſible Church, though ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely corrupted; and that the quarrell began to wax warm, and the Preſſe to complain of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peſtred with oppoſite Tractates: in a due care to lay this ill-raiſed ſpirit, beſides my own full and ſatisfactorie Apology then ſet forth, I appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to other unqueſtionable Divines, the Oracles of our Church; writing my publick letters to two famouſly learned Biſhops, Biſhop <hi>Morton</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Davenant;</hi> and to two eminent and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:167993:5"/>
approvedly Orthodox Doctours, Doctor <hi>Pride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Primroſe</hi> Paſtor of the <hi>French</hi> Church; earneſtly deſiring them to declare their judgements freely and fully concerning this point. All which have not only in their publiſhed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers declared this to be an undoubted truth, in the ſenſe propoſed, proving it by ſound and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing reaſons, and aſſerting it, not as their own private opinion, but as conceived by them to be the juſt and common tenet of all Orthodox Divines and Churches: but withall affirming that thoſe men little know what prejudice they do to the Proteſtant cauſe, that hold the contrary. The inſtances whereof it were eaſy for me to give, were it not that I fear and hate to furniſh the adverſary with weapons to wound our ſelves. I wis, thoſe our enemies are quick-eyed enough to eſpy their own advantages, and our expoſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the danger of ſelf-wronging conſequences, without our intimation. The grave and ſolid determination of thoſe godly and judicious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines is ſtill extant in a thouſand hands: upon the publication whereof, the world then reſted ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, my ſelf acquitted, the adverſary ſilenced, and the controverſie quieted, which is now thus uncharitably and unadviſedly raked up from under the aſhes of a wiſe and juſt ſilence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:167993:6"/>The truth is, nothing but a groſſe and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate miſtake is guilty of this quarrell: The homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymy of this word True, (as maſter <hi>Blake</hi> in his anſwer to maſter <hi>Tombes</hi>) beſides the fore-named authours (hath truly obſerved,) makes all this ſeeming difference. If we take a True Church for a true believing Church; ſo the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is far from a True Church: If we take a True Church for a Church truly exiſting in a viſible profeſsion of Chriſtianity, ſo it cannot be denied to be a True viſible Church. A thief is no True man, yet he is truly a man. So the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> though falſe in too many of her Doctrines, yet hath a true viſible being. Her Clients vainly flatter her with the title of Catholick, or Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall: we expect no thanks from her to ſay ſhe is univerſally corrupted, yet a Church viſible ſtill. Thoſe groſſe errours wherewith ſhe abounds, have marred her firſt purity, but do not forfeit her out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Church-ſhip. It were a ſtrange uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe to ſay that a <hi>Romaniſt</hi> is no Chriſtian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though too many of their Tenets are juſtly bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for Antichriſtian. And where there is a ſociety of Chriſtians, not directly and obſtinately deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Foundation, (though otherwiſe foul, and erroneous in opinion,) there cannot be denied a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible appearance of a Church. Let the Church of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:167993:6"/>
               <hi>Rome</hi> then go for as erroneous, impure, falſe in matter of opinion and practice, as ſhe is: ſhe cannot be denyed the face of a Church, how ever rotten at the heart. All which hath been ſo judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, &amp; amply declared by thoſe learned &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Conteſts, whom I formerly mentioned, in their publick diſcourſes of this point, that I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Sadler</hi> had had leiſure to have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, he would rather have diſtinguiſhed then denied, and the Queſtioniſt (who ever he was) would, upon ſecond thoughts, have thought good to ſuffer my innocent name to reſt in peace; whereas now, he hath both wronged me, and himſelf more, in drawing upon himſelf an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of either ignorance, or uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or both. God forgive him, I do.</p>
            <p>Thus we too well ſee how apt nature is, even in thoſe who profeſſe an eminence in holineſſe, to raiſe and maintain animoſities againſt thoſe whoſe calling, or perſon they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to find cauſe to diſlike; and perhaps alſo to brand with the black note of unjuſt infamy, thoſe who concenter not with them in ſome lighter opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, (although indiviſibly theirs, in the brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the ſame moſt holy faith, and meekly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting to hold with them the unity of the ſpirit, in the bonds of peace.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:167993:7"/>Truly Sir, (to open my ſelf freely to you) nothing hath more wounded my ſoul, nor drawn deeper ſighs from me in ſecret, then to ſee that, whereas our dear and bleſsed Saviour hath ſo vehemently encharged all his true diſciples with the duty of mutuall Love; and his choſen veſſell, with ſo zealous importunity, cries down ſtrife, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, as arguing mere carnality, and utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the truth of Chriſtian diſpoſition and practice: yet no Grace is ſuch a ſtranger to us (for the moſt part) as Charity; nor no imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo univerſally rife amongſt us, on all hands, as quarrels and brawlings, both verball and reall, ariſing commonly from falſe ſurmiſes and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtructions; and proceeding (too often) not to the ſcratching of faces, but to the ripping of bowels, and to the ſtabbing of hearts; to the infinite ſcandall of the Goſpell of peace, and to the ſport and triumph of <hi>Gath</hi> and <hi>Aſcalon.</hi> Now <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
