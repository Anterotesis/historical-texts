            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Right Honourable
The Parliament of England

            <head type="sub">The humble Petition of <hi>ARTHUR HASLERIG.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>SHEWETH,</opener>
            <p>THat your ſaid Petitioner hath ever ſince the beginning of theſe troubles been a man of a moſt turbulent and vexatious
ſpirit; and finding himſelf grown a little popular among the rude multitude, he made the beſt uſe of it he could to
the ruine of his Countrey; So that ſhould your Petitioner reckon up to your Honours all the Crimes and Tyrannical
actions which he made a ſhift to juſtifie while he was in Authority, his Petition would ſwell into a Volume, and
his impatience would hardly give him leave to tarry till you had read it. Truly, he is afraid all the ſand in the Sea might run
through an Hour-glaſs before you could perform that task. Your Petitioner alſo ſheweth, that he ſhould be loath to be called
to his anſwer four and forty times, as <hi>Cato</hi> was, who was likewiſe ſo many times acquitted; for he is afraid that one time would
be enough to find him forty times over guilty. The pride of whoſe heart hath ever been greater then Sathans; and he queſtions
not, but that if he had been an Angel of Light in Heaven before the Creation, he had had the ſame fall with <hi>Lucifer;</hi> at the
pooreneſs of whoſe ſpirit he much wonders; for that if it had been your Petitioners caſe, he ſhould not have reſted ſo well
ſatisfied at the change of his Government, and have given over without ſo much as contriving one Plot for the recovery of it
again. The aim of his Ambition being ſo high, that had he ability according to his deſire, he would deſtroy the King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>Pope,</hi> the great <hi>Turk,</hi> the great <hi>Mogul,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> with all the reſt of the Potentates and Princes of
the World, not becauſe they are either Idolators, or Pagans, or Enemies to Chriſt and his Doctrine; but out of his
inſatiable deſire to domineer over the whole World. He alſo further ſheweth, that the Reaſon why he hath forſaken Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
is, becauſe the Miniſters tell him that Chriſt muſt Reign over him; and he doth hereby manifeſt to your Honours
his great envy to <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> becauſe he had ſo great a Power over one of the greateſt Monarchs in the World, as to lead
him up and down in a Cage, and alwayes made him lye at his Horſe ſide to tread upon, when he got up into his Stirrup; which
honour he alwayes coveted, though now he finds himſelf in a ſmall poſſibility to obtain it, he having done all that poſſibly he
could to enſlave his Countrey to the Tyranny of two or three Uſurpers beſides himſelf, who had promiſed that he ſhould
be their Supream, as one who was reſolved to have ſtopped his ears againſt all the clamours of the oppreſſed People, and
with a fury and violence to have carried on his Great Work; He alſo doth acknowledge, that he alwayes had a great kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for <hi>Dionyſius, Sylla, Caeſar Borgia, Nero</hi> &amp; <hi>Caligula,</hi> becauſe they were great Tyrants and Oppreſſours of their Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
Your Petitioner in the laſt place further declareth, that he beareth an immortal and unremoveable Spleen, Hatred
and Malice to his Excellency, and your Honours, for interrupting his deſigns, which hath ſo encreaſed his ſtomack, that he
could eat both your Honours and him with Salt; Nevertheleſs he is now conſtrained to ſue unto you for pardon, and</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In conſideration of the Premiſes, he humbly craveth of your honours, that you would in the firſt place ſet a
Mark upon him, as God ſet upon <hi>Cain,</hi> leaſt the People whom he hath ſo much wronged ſhould ſlay him
whereever they meet him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That he may have the Liberty to wear a Braſs Helmet to ſecure his raſh head from Stones and Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batts,
for that he finds the Free-born Boyes of <hi>England</hi> very much enraged againſt him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That he may have an Army of ten thouſand Foot, and ſix thouſand Horſe to guard him from outrages,
which if your honours pleaſe to grant, he will not onely uſe it to his own advantage, but to the confuſion of all
your good Endeavours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That your Honours would fully forgive your Petitioner, and give him an Act of Indemnity, he
having an Eſtate able to ſatisfie moſt perſons that ſhall now call him to an accompt, which upon aſſurance of your
gracious favour he promiſeth (though very unwillingly) to do, provided you will not ſuffer his Children to go a
Begging.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That you would be pleaſed to give your Petitioner and Coll. <hi>Lambert</hi> a Certificate to <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi>
to give us a Command at the Battel of <hi>Armageddon,</hi> For that we underſtand, that if the Saints get the better at
that fight, all confuſion will be at an end in this World, which we ſhould be very ſorry to ſee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <hi>Laſtly</hi> if all, or any of the former Particulars may not be granted, That your Honours would be pleaſed to hang
him out of the way, for that it was his deſire on Thurſday was ſeven-night, and becauſe he alſo promiſed it before one
of the Lords Commiſſioners, if his cauſe went againſt him, which happened accordingly.</hi>
            </p>
            <closer>And your Petioner ſhall never Pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
