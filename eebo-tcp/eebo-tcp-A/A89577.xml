            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">

But if you pleaſe you may firſt feaſt your <hi>eyes;</hi> doe but behold the face of this Aſſembly, I dare ſay it will be one of the excellenteſt feaſts that ever your eyes were refreſhed with: Here in this Aſſembly you may firſt ſee the <hi>two Houſes of Parliament,</hi> the Honourable Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, after thus many yeares wraſtling with extreme difficulties, in their endevouring to preſerve an undone Kingdome, and to purge and reforme a back-ſliding and a polluted Church, you may behold them ſtill not only
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:125946:4"/>
preſerved from ſo many treacherous deſignes, ſecret treaſons, and open violences, but as reſolved as ever cheerfully to goe on with this great worke, which God hath put into their hands. Here you may alſo ſee <hi>his Excellency</hi> (my moſt honoured Lord) the Generall of all our forces by land; and neare him that other noble Lord, the Commander of our forces by Sea; and with them abundance of noble and reſolute Commanders al of them with their faces like unto Lions, who after, ſo many terrible battells, and abundance of difficulties, and charging in the face of ſo many thouſand deaths, are all of them ſtill preſerved, and not a haire of their heads fallen to the ground. Here alſo you may behold the <hi>Repreſentative body of the City of London,</hi> the Lord Mayor, the Court of Aldermen, the Common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, the <hi>Militia,</hi> and in them the face and affection of this glorious City; <hi>This City,</hi> which under God hath hitherto had the honour of being the greateſt meanes of the ſalvation of the whole kingdome; and after the expence of millions of treaſure, and thouſands of their lives, ſtill as faithfull and reſolute to live and die in the cauſe of God as ever heretofore. Here you may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſee a <hi>Reverend Aſſembly of</hi> grave and learned <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi> who daily wait upon the Angel in the Mount, to receive from him the lively Oracles, and the patterne of Gods houſe, to preſent unto you. All theſe are of our <hi>owne</hi> Nation; and with them you may ſee the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, reverend,</hi> and <hi>learned Commiſsioners of the Church of Scotland;</hi> and in them behold the wiſdome and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their whole Church and Nation, willing to live and dye with us. All theſe you may behold in one view; and which is more, you may behold them all of <hi>one heart,</hi> and one minde, after ſo many plots and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:125946:4"/>
to divide them one from another, and thereby to ruine them all: And which is yet more, you may ſee them all met together this day <hi>on purpoſe,</hi> both to <hi>praiſe God for this union,</hi> and to rejoice in it, and to hold it out to all the world, and thereby to teſtifie, that as one man they will live and dye together in this common cauſe of God, of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt his Church, and theſe three Kingdomes. O beloved! how beautifull is the face of this Aſſembly? Verily I may ſay of it, as it was ſaid of <hi>Solomons throne,</hi> That <hi>the like was not to be ſeene in any other Nation;</hi> I queſtion where ever the like Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly was ſeene this thouſand yeeres upon the face of the earth: Me thinkes I may call this Aſſembly <hi>The hoſte of</hi>

               </p>
               <p>You will find alſo in this Chapter, <hi>That ſuch as did adhere to</hi> David <hi>in his low condition, (when the Lord had tryed and humbled them all) found to their comfort in the end, that they were no loſers by it; They after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards being made his Worthies, his Counſellors, and Princes.</hi>

joy at this time; the other from the <hi>manner</hi> of expreſſing their joy; The <hi>matter</hi> of their joy, you have in theſe words, <hi>that they were of one heart, and one mind, to ſet Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid to be their King;</hi> The manner of expreſſing their joy was this, they <hi>were eating, and drinking, and feaſting, at the coſt of all the Tribes in whoſe precincts their meeting was;</hi> Thoſe of <hi>Zebulon,</hi> and <hi>Napthali,</hi> and <hi>Iſſachar,</hi> did in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance expend their Oxen, and Sheepe, and Wine, and Oile, and all the delicates, to refreſh their Brethren; for the Army was I thinke no leſſe then two or three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand of them, who upon this occaſion were come together: from theſe two, I ſhall endeavour to handle theſe two Leſſons. The firſt is,</p>
               <p>That it is <hi>the greateſt matter and cauſe of joy that can bee to any People, to find a concurrence of Nobles, and Commons,</hi>

                  <hi>and Souldiers, and Citizens, and Divines, to ſet up</hi> David <hi>for their King;</hi> ſuch an union and concurrence is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the greateſt joy in all the World. Secondly,</p>
               <p>That this joy ſpringing from ſuch a concurrence to ſet up <hi>David</hi> to bee their King, may very lawfully, and comely be <hi>expreſſ'd in feaſting, eating, and drinking.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I begin with the firſt of theſe, <hi>That it is a matter of the greateſt joy in all the World, that can bee to any people, to finde</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                  <hi>ſuch a concurrence as there was in this Chapter, to ſet up</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid <hi>to be their King:</hi> Where firſt we muſt inquire, what is here intended by ſetting up <hi>David</hi> to bee their King: Know therfore (beloved) that <hi>David</hi> is to be conſidered two wayes, he ſtands in a two-fold relation, even in this his Coronation: The firſt is <hi>Typicall;</hi> the ſecond is <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall; Typicall,</hi> and ſo <hi>David is Chriſt: Politicall,</hi> and ſo <note place="margin">Explained in two Branches.</note>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:125946:7"/>
might give you twenty ſeverall places of Scripture for proof of both the branches: Firſt, <hi>David</hi> was a type of Chriſt; <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ordinarily called <hi>David;</hi> you will not find any one perſon (who <note place="margin">

welfare of the Church: Now when they concurred in this action, you ſhall finde that <hi>David and all the houſe of Iſrael plaied before the Lord on all manner of inſtrument,</hi> on Harps and Pſalteries, on Timbrels and on Cornets and on Cimbals, with ſhouting and ſound of Trumpets, and the <hi>King himſelfe</hi> being cloathed with a linne Ephod danced with all his might, and gloried in his dancing, though we know <hi>Michal</hi> his wife deſpiled him for it, as if he had played the foole; and all this becauſe they ſo well agreed in bringing the Arke, and ſetting it up in his place, in the Tabernacle that <hi>David</hi> had pitched for it, which was nothing in effect, but the <hi>ſetting up the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, both God and man, to be acknowledged as Lord and King in the midſt of the Church.</hi> So likewiſe when <hi>Solomon</hi> had builded the Temple, in 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. when the Arke was to be ſet upon the Table in the <note place="margin">1 <hi>King</hi> 8:</note>

               <p>Thus it doth it as <hi>ſignum.</hi> 2 Book upon it <hi>ut cauſa,</hi> as it works to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <note place="margin">2 <hi>As a cauſe working it, Pſa</hi> 17 2 27.</note> the effecting of it: Nothing which men can doe carryes ſuch an energie as this joynt conſent doth, and that 3. ſeverall wayes.</p>
               <p>Firſt ſuch a publique concurrence of all theſe, is a marvellous engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that people to adhere to the Lord without ſliding back.</p>
               <p>When <hi>David</hi> had <hi>ſworne unto the Lord to find out a place for the Lord, an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation for the mighty God of</hi> Jacob, <hi>he would give no ſleepe to his eyes, nor ſlumber to his eye lids, untill</hi> hee had done what he could to effect it.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:125946:11"/>
So when they have ſworne a Covenant, and their Princes and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and all of them joyne together with ſuch an vnanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, it averreth &amp; holdeth out to the world their full and unchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reſolution to ſpend, and to be ſpent, and to do all that ever they are able for the promoting of this worke; Now this ingageing of a Nation to the Lord is an infinite meanes of effecting it, and inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Lord to ſware to them, as he did to <hi>David</hi> in the like <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132. 11.</note> caſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this concurrence in the Princes and Leaders of the <note place="margin">2</note> people is a marvelous meanes to draw all the people on as one man without any oppoſition, when they that are their Leaders doe thus goe before them, there is a notable example in this Text of the Tirbe of <hi>Iſſachar. v.</hi> 32. of the reſt of the tribes it's ſaid how many there came; of ſome Tribes 10 thouſand, of ſome 20. thouſand, of ſome 40. thouſand but of the Tribe of <hi>Iſſachar,</hi> it is not ſaid how many came, but only 200. that were the Leaders and Lords of that Tribe with perfect heart, and the Text addeth, <hi>all their Bretheren were at their command,</hi> all the whole Tribe; If the Tribe of <hi>Iſſachar</hi> were 40. 50. 100. thouſand, ſet but the 200. Leaders right, and they cary all the reſt right infallibly whether they will or no: And you all know by experience the infinite power Leaders have to cary the people to any thing, be it good or evill; <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may lead the people to worſhip golden calves, <hi>Joaſh</hi> and his <note place="margin">1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12. 28. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. 28.</note> Princes may draw the people to forſake God; And againe <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaphat, Hezechiel, Ioſiah,</hi> and their Princes and Rulers may draw the people of the Lord into a Covenant to ſerve the Lord. That is the ſecond way to effect it, by leading the people to ſubmit unto Chriſt alſo.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this vnity and concurrence of heart and ſpirit, doth infinitely daunt and dampe the ſpirit of their Enemies who would hinder the worke, neither is any thing ſuch a terrour to thoſe that would deſtroy and hinder the ſetting up of Chriſt, as to ſee an vnity and concurrence of heart and hand of thoſe that are the prime Leading men to carie on the worke: This is notably ſet forth in the Booke of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> when <hi>Tobias</hi> and <hi>Sanballat,</hi> and the reſt of them had tried all their wits to devide and ſcare them, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 6.</note>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:125946:12"/>
and yet ſaw, they went on with the worke, that they would build, though they built with the ſword in one hand and a Trew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell in the other, and though they wrought both night and day, and that ſome ſlept whilſt others waked, and on they would goe the Rulers and Heads being the forwardeſt of all, when the enemie ſaw that, the Text ſaith, <hi>they were extreamly caſt downe, becauſe they ſaw the worke was wrought by the hand of God:</hi> So that enemies faile in their ſpirits, when they ſee without changing the Nobles and Leaders are reſoluedly ſet to carie on this worke, <hi>That Chriſt ſhall be ſet vp for Lord and King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus <hi>Beloved</hi> I have cleared the firſt Branch of this obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: That the greateſt joy that can be to any people is to ſee ſuch a concurrence of heart, to have the Lord Chriſt ſet vp for Lord &amp; King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the Application of it I ſhall inſiſt only vpon two things.</hi>

carriage at your Table which may grieve him, and make him ſay, <hi>This Roome I delight not to be in;</hi> Remember all the Feaſts of Gods people in the Old Teſtament, they were <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> or Feaſts which were accompanied with <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> yea the very heathen counted them prophan men, who would offer to make a feaſt of that, that was not firſt offered to their gods, hereby to make it bleſſed to them; <hi>So do you</hi> eate and drink as in the preſence of the Lord, that you may praiſe the Name of the Lord, who hath ſhewed this mercy to you; doe as the little birds, who take not one drop, but they lift up their heads to heaven, as if they would tell all the world, whence they received their food; ſo do you acknowledge the Lord, give him his glory and his praiſe; let there be no uncomely carriage among you; I ſhould juſtly be blamed if I ſhould think you needed any perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to keepe you from drinking healths, from riot and exceſſe; I know you abhor it, but I beg that none of your ſervants, nor atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants may do it, that nothing may be done which would grieve the Lord.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let the maine end of your feaſting be <hi>Symbolum &amp; vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum charitatis,</hi> a pledge and bond to ſhew, and more, to make you all one, of one heart, and one minde; that you may pledge one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſuch a Cup, as may not only ſpeak you all to be one, but may attaine the very end, for which this feaſt is made, more to ingage you in this Common cauſe. That this Feaſt, may be as a Feaſt, which (I think) <hi>Lucian</hi> ſpeakes of it, where a poore wronged man made a Feaſt of an Oxe, and every one who taſted of his meate, did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by engage himſelfe to live and dye with that poore man to recover his right, in ſomewhat that he was wronged in; and ſo let this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage your Spirits, that now you have eaten and drunk of their Cup, that Your and their Spirits, and Prayers, and Hearts, and Purſes ſhall be all one; O if this might be the carriage of it, this day would be a <hi>bleſſed day.</hi>
