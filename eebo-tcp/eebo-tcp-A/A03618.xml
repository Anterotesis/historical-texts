            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is not ſufficient to leaue yle undon, but that we muſt do the godd commaundid by god and his lawe. As Dauid ſaythe Pſal. 1. bleſſid is he that walky<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the not in the concell of the yle &amp;c. but hathe his meditacions in the law of god day and nyght. Wyſte I that my laboure ſhuld neuer do good, ner healpe the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience of one manne: yet for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundementes ſake would I haue wroten, to ſet one oracion agaynſt the other, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe I ſe the Name of god blaſphemid by the opinion that ye defend. But I haue hope that it ſhall ſomwhat auayle to confound the falſhode, and bring the truithe the ſoner to light. I know it is the condicion of god to permit unto euery oracion his nature and condicion, as we ſe ſom tymes by preaching of the trew word of god people ar conuertyd unto faythe, ſome tyme, by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the doctrine of men people ar ſeducid and caryd ffrom the faythe. It is not the nature of god to make the falſe oratour domme when he would perſwade à falſe opinion, Nether to make his auditours deffe, but as Iſay he ſuffrethe the oracion to work his uertewe, and leaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the ffre election unto the audience to imbrace whiche part they lyſt, by grace, and à conſenting will, the good, by the deuill and there awne malyce the yle. Now the oratour of god muſt perſuade withe none othere argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes or wordes then the maſter of the ſcole Chriſt ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>the tawght. The Prophetes and apoſteles wrote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: It is no orator of Chriſtes, that contrarie unto his Canones, Ru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les and preceptes, would perſwade in the churche ony

That law muſt nedes be mooſt perfete, that can haue nothing addid unto it, nor nothing taken from it, of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition is the ſcripture as ye know by the wordes of Moſes and the reuelacion of Iohan. Luc. in his later booke ſaythe: Superiore uolumine diximus Theophile, de omnibus quae cepit Ieſus facere &amp; doce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. The whych wordes Ioan.

Thoſe that will ſtabliſhe the Maſſe as ye do my lord and defend I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrye: Muſt proue the thyng ye ſpeke by the ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, and playnly ſatisfie the places of the ſcripture browg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te agaynſt youe. ye muſt not darken the places with glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes of your ymagyon.

Now likwyce to the other part of the ſacrament. If the will refer this pronowne hoc only unto the ſigne &amp; ad rem ſimbolicam. Behold Luk &amp; Paule and thow ſhalt fee playnely, that nether Chriſt callyd the winne that the Apoſtelles drank his blud, nether, the priſt if he beliue Luke and Paule ſhuld not ſay, that under the forme of winne is Chriſtes bludd But under the forme of the cuppe or chalyce is the blud of Chriſt. For Chriſtis wordes be theſe. Hoc poculum eſt nouum teſtamentum in meo ſanguine. Why dooth the priſt ſpeak of the form of winne when Chriſt ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke of the cuppe and not of the winne. If there be no tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe to be admyttyd in the wordes of the ſupper (I will not admit this figure continens pro contento) let them proue the goldin chalice, tobe tranſubſtanciatid into the bludd.

unto Idoles Logiſmos talis eſt. His conſideracion and intencion was to declare that it was Idolatryre, to eat of ydoles meat with ydolatres. And prouith his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſicion deducing his argument à comparatis if thiſrae lites, in etyng the ſacryfices dedicatyd unto god, were participant of the thing that the ſacrifices were offryd for. Then ſouch as eat of meates dedicatyd unto ydoles were pertakers of the ſame religion wherfore this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes unto ydoles were offryd. The firſt part of the reaſon is trew by the wordes that he à legith out of Moſes. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dete Iſraclem, iuxta carnem &amp;c. They were ſuer to be pertakers of the temple that eat the meat dedicatyd into the temple. So were they ſure that eat of the meates de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatyd unto ydoles, pertakers of ydolatrye. Therefore Paule concludith thus. Non poteſtis poculum domini bibere, &amp; poculum daemoniorum. Non poteſtis menſae domini participes eſſe, &amp; menſae daemoniorum. They that communicatid with the fideles, were participant of there religion: they that communicatid with ydolatres, were like wyce participant of the ydolatrie. Now the ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me wayes that thinfideles were participant of the deuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les that they worſhippid, the ſame wayes the fideles we reparticipant of Chriſtes body: in falſe fayth were the knyt and unit unto the deuill in trew fayth the fideles unit unto Chriſt. And as the ydolatres dyd not by hand with the meat dedicatyd unto ydoles exhibit and dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the deuill to him that eat of the deuilles ſacrament, ſo thoſe that eat of the bread broken by the miniſter, as Chriſt commaunded had not the body of Chriſt deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryd by hand unto them but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

with Chriſt and therfore dyd eat of one bread, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatid to be the miſtery of his glorious death. So dooth Paules argument procede that becauſe wear by fayth one body myſtically with Chriſt we eat of one myſticall bread, to teſtifie the ſame, Quoniam inquit, unus panis &amp; unum corpus multi ſumus, Nam omnes ex eodem pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne participamus 1.

They cannot tell what this word offerre meanith. When they ſay they offer the ſonne of god.
