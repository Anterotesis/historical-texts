            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:57570:3"/>
the loss of such a <hi>Master in Israel:</hi> as the world (I say) is, at no small loss, by being robbed of so rich a treasure, which was intended for them; so, these few, which the Author did not at all intend for publike use, are here sent abroad: he did violence to the desires of many in refusing to publish them (howbeit he was known to consult the satisfaction and advantage of the truely godly, more then his own contentment or ease) not because he thought them unworthy of a scholler, as not being stuffed with a great many sterril notions: If any alledge this, it's <hi>non Causa pro Causa;</hi> but the true reason why he endeavoured to suppress &amp; conceal them from the world, was, lest any man should think of him above what was meet; because (if not of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of revelation, which yet God did indeed give his suffering servant, as will be clear by comparing what he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw, both as to the work in generall, and as to some particular persons, with the event; yet) of the abundance of soul-refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manifestations that he had: This was the true reason which made him inexorable and kept him from listening to the most pressing &amp; assiduous entreaties of his friends: he had many things which commended him to the people of God; but his covering his great attainments as a Christian, and the pregnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of his parts as a scholler, with the vail of humility (which is the chief ornament of a gracious spirit) as it did render him peculiarly &amp; deservedly dear to them; so it made both the one and the other shine more brightly, &amp; did besids their native and intrinseck beauty, give an adventitious brightness and lustre to all that great stock of grace, and store of Parts, which were found <hi>(rara avis interris)</hi> joyntly in him. It was manifest to all who were but a little acquaint with him, that his modestie and humility was such, that in all his most eminent appearances for God, he studied to disappear, lest he should by standing up, be guilty of intercepting any part of that glory, which belongs to him alone; <hi>of whom are all things, &amp; for whom are all things:</hi> neither was he at any loss hereby; for thus he became great in the Kingdom of God: his growing downward, in that high and Gospel-adorning grace of humility, made him grow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in favour with God and all Good men; and thus by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself, and seeking God alone; he both found what he
<pb facs="tcp:57570:3"/>
sought, and got what he was not willing to take, nor would owne as his due.</p>
            <p>But, besids this true account I have given, why the world was deprived of so usefull &amp; edifying a peice to this day; I think it should not pass without a <hi>remarke,</hi> that God in his good providence, hath reserved the publication thereof, for such a time as this, wherein it seems to promise a singular advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, beyond &amp; above, what was probably attainable at any other season: First as to the suffering people of God, who while they are deprived of these things in publike, for the most part, which comforted them over all their sorrowes, &amp; while the songs of the Sanctuary (because the Philistims have stopped most of these wells out of which they used to draw &amp; drinke with joy, that, which was sweter to the taste, then honey to the mouth; or they have thrown that into them, which hath not onely made them lose their former relish &amp; sweetness; but hath rendred them so bitter, that they are now become gall and wormewood) are turned into howling &amp; bitter lamentation; while it is thus I say, with the people of God, that in stead of being made glad in his house of prayer as formerly, they are sighing for the ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these solemne assemblies: they may in their sad hours commune with this sufferer, who not being willing to eat his morsell his alone, speaks to them good words and comfortable: he telleth you, beloved sufferers, what a heaven is to be had in Christ's company, even when ye are put to bear the cross, &amp; to have shame &amp; suffering for his sake, as your inseperable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: Neither is his discourse upon this subject, an empty or idle speculation; nay, he speaks what he knoweth: the God for whose Cause he suffered, comforted him in the like tribulation, &amp; so he is in case to comfort you, by the comforts, wherewith he himself was comforted of God. Next, as to these of the Ministers of the Gospel, who by the violence of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries are driven from their flocks [which to a godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster is the greatest of afflictions] such I say, may see for strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their hands, while they are put to contend with these that are too strong for them; how this noble witness, who suffered for the same cause, carried, how he acquit himself, &amp; overcame: the Archers shot sore at him, but his bow abod in

it's strength<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> The armes of his hands were made so strong, by the hand of the mighty God of Jacob, that he was too hard for all that entered the lists with him, &amp; when they thought they had done sufficient, either to force him to a compliance, or to make him faint under the effects of their fury, by depriving him of his ministery, which was dearer to him then his life; he was not by all this, so much put to suffering (to speak properly) as he was for a season, a little removed from the noise &amp; distrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is abroad in the world, to be alone with God. O bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed solitude! O sweet societie!) he was taken out of the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour &amp; confusion that is here below, up to the mount, where he was admitted to a neer familiarity, &amp; experienced the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of that fellowship with God, which he had preached unto others: Though he was not taken from the earth; yet he was not onely keeped from the evill that was then, and is now, in the world; but he injoyed such a heaven under his heavy pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surs, that if the being about of his Master's business, had not been prized by him, as preferable to his own consolation, he would have been in hazard of forgetting the troubles of Zion, and of saying, <hi>it's good for me to be here;</hi> but he was such a servant, as made is his meat &amp; drink to doe his Masters will, he had so learned Christ, as to prefer his concernments to his Chief joy: &amp; therefore, ye will finde him often in these Epistles, feasting upon the consolations of God, with the tear in his eye, while he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members Zion, &amp; calls to mind the desolat condition of the flocks of Christ [particularly his own] for whom nothing was prepared. He found in his solitude such a measure of presence, as could hardly have been expected, out of the chamber of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, where there is fulnesse of joy &amp; pleasures for evermore: he know more in this happy retirement, of the excercise of them who are above (who being made Kings unto God, have crowns upon their head, &amp; being made priests also, sacrifice these to the giver) then he could have learned, by revolving all the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes that are written in many ages, amidst the greatest out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward calme &amp; tranquillity: This is the summer fruit which grew out of the hard tree of the cross of Christ that he was put to bear, which was so sweet to his taste, that it made him disdain the dainties of his Adversaries, &amp; disrelish these sowre &amp; unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury
<pb facs="tcp:57570:4"/>
delights of the sons of men, which however they may at first seem to have some petty sweet in them; yet they quickly set the teeth of the eater on edge, &amp; are found bitter in the belly &amp; of a bad digestion: These were the quiet fruits of ighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that his servant reaped by hi sufferings for Christ, &amp; that in such plenty, that out of his abundance, he sends some bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets of these sweet fruits abroad amongst his friends, both to bring up a good report upon his liberall Lord &amp; Master, who allowes on his followers, while they are pinched with penury of other comforts, full measure, heaped up, running over, &amp; shaken together: And upon the cross of Christ also, to the end it might appear, that this burden is so far from imbittering the life of a suffering saint, that by the contrary, as the sufferings of Christ abound in him, so his consolation also aboundeth by Jesus Christ. The publication then, I say, of these Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, seems in providence to be trysted on purpose, with the sufferings of his servants at this time, that we may be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by his example, to a Zealous faithfulnesse, &amp; a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full suffering, &amp; may wax bold by his bonds, under, &amp; in which, he did experience, much of the glorious liberty of the sons of God: How oft doe we finde him preferring his confinement, to all the sublunary contentments of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>securers? here did he feed upon these pure &amp; unmixed delights, which put such gladness in the heart, as expells all the Latent &amp; lurking griefs that are there, and causeth the soul, while sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with all outward trouble to sing; while they feed upon ashes, &amp; fill their belly with the east wind, who feast upon the tears of the people of God, and seem to have nothing else to interrupt their tranquillity, but how they may trouble the children of peace: It was under this restraint, &amp; in this house of his bondage, when being shut up from, and spoiled of all creatur-comforts, that he found the surpassing sweetness of the consolations of God, which taste best, when they are most free of the mud, &amp; mixture of other injoyments: there it was where he found the truth of that saying of <hi>Augustin, Tanta est dulcedo caelestis gaudii, ut si una guttula difflueret in infernum; totam amaritudinem infer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

bitterness of that place of torment:</hi> The love of God and the joy of the Holy Ghost, was so abundantly shed abroad in his heart, while he was in the furnace, that his cross was not onely made there by light &amp; easie, &amp; his life pleasant; but ye have him often saying (because he found by these foretasts what inconceivable consolation must be, in the immediat vision and full fruition of God) that if there were no other way, to come at the possession of that blessedness, he would, not onely chuse to swime through a sea of outward troubles; but he would wade through the lake of fire &amp; brimstone, to be possessed of God himself: and there is none, who knew the gracious sobriety of this holy man, that will judge he complemented in saying so: nay, there are none, who have found what a cool refreshing shade &amp; aboundant consolation the soul finds, in the company of the son of man, while they walk with him amdist the flames of the most scorching fiery trials; but they would think strange, if he spake otherwise.

And so soon as any begins to mind seriously the concernments of his soul, then, <hi>sine monitore,</hi> he falls in a dislike with them, &amp; their way: I doe not say, that all who hate the <hi>Prelats</hi> are <hi>Saints,</hi> for their is sufficient in their way to make them odious to others; but is not this known, that these who once begin to set their face towards God, turn their back upon them: I am sure this observation does seldome fail, or can be proved false in our native Land: And then on the other hand, since these men were exalted, doe not the wicked walk on every side? Is there not a profane spirit (the constant attendant of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> in Scotland) broken loose in the land? Is there not such a flood of impiety running through the land, that carryes most men down the current, as hath hardly been seen? hath not this leprousie spread it self over the whole land? So, that we are an abomination &amp; talk to all about us: And if any would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to accomplish a diligent search, to finde out the fountain that casts forth this mire &amp; dirt, to the defiling of the Land, &amp; defacing of congregations, he would it may befind it, where it ought lest to be expected: These streams of impety &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity
<pb facs="tcp:57570:10"/>
run from the sanctuary, hence is it, that profanity goes forth through the whole land; &amp; can it be otherwise when so many faithfull Ministers are driven away, &amp; men put in their places to handle the law, of most of whom without breach of Charitie, it may be said, that they know not God, &amp; care not for the souls of his people: It's under the shaddow of this plant (which because it is not of our heavenly father's planting, we live under the expectation, &amp;, though our eyes should be shut before we see it, we hope to die in the faith of it's being pluckt up) that these weeds have grown up, so that alas! The vineyard of the Lord of hosts, is now no more like his inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, it bringeth forth briers &amp; thorns in stead of good fruit: He planted the church of <hi>Scotland a noble vine; Wholly a right seed,</hi> but since it became a seminary for <hi>Prelats,</hi> the conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the generalitie proclaims this, that we are turned into <hi>the degenerat plant of a strange vine unto him:</hi> This is the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laticall reformation, which is sutable to it self all along; for having purged out of the church, the faithfull Ministers of Christ [&amp; the few who are yet remaining, being in expectation of the same lot) what can follow among the people; but, that the Land should be drowned with a deluge of profanity: And are we not for the most part [Oh if with a suitable measure of sorrow I could make mention of it] as the children of the Ethiopians to him? Are not our spots, unlike the spots of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? This observation I say, as it was a very heart-staying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration in former times, &amp; was in stead of many arguments amongst them who where no great disputants; so I hope: [since it was never more evident) it will still prove a heart-establishing consideration in the faith once delivered to the saints.</p>

as a thing very observable, &amp; the other, will I know, be taken notice of, &amp; welcomed by all the people of God: The first relats to the time when this faithfull labourer was removed to his rest, which was the night following that darke, &amp; dismall day, wherein the <hi>Act Rescissorie</hi> was past; the Lord thereby shewing a special piece of indulgence to his servant, in not adding grief to his sorrow, but hiding it from these eyes, which had accous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed themselves to trickle down without intermission, both for what he saw, &amp; what he foresaw: Since the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> so solemnly engaged to God, would at once burst all these bonds, &amp; cast away these Cords from them, which were neither our bondage nor our burden, but the badge of that glorious liberty, whereinto with a strong hand he had vindicat us: &amp; upon the matter, they would needs say to the God, whose sworne subjects &amp; servants they were, <hi>be gone from us;</hi> he would not let his faithfull servant (whose zeal to the work of God was such, that if the report of this shamefull revolt had not killed him at the first hearing outright; yet it alone without any other sicknesse, would have been more then enough, to have brought down his head with sorrow to the grave) see another sun arise upon that Land, out of which the sun of righteousness was banished by a law: And alas! Who would desire to dwell, where Christ may not reside, with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, honour, &amp; safety? Who, that prefers Jerusalem to there chief joy, would love to out-live the departing of the glory? Might not Jesus Christ have said to our <hi>Parliament,</hi> for which of my good deeds is it, that ye stone me? Have I been a wildernesse or land of drought unto you? Were ye not honourable &amp; renowned amongst the Churches abroad, after ye became precious in my sight?

What, is this my entertainment, where I was once crowned &amp; cryed up for a King? What a strange &amp; astonishing change is this, that the very persons who swore unto me the <hi>Oath of alleagance,</hi> &amp; did sing in my company, spreading their garments in the way with shouting, are now crying, <hi>Crucifie</hi> him, <hi>Crucifie</hi> him? Shall I not have whereupon to lay my head, except it be on a cold stone in a prison, amongst a people, who after a most solemne man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, had given themselves away unto me?

            <p>As for the letters themselves, I shall not offer to commend them, they had letters of recommendation deeply engraven on the hearts of all who have seen them, &amp; can savour the things that are of God; this they had I say, amongst them who have their senses exercised to discern good &amp; evil, long before they were made thus publike in the world; so they need not my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, nor will the detraction of any, who have a minde for that, blast their reput; as they are above the one, so they dispise the other; but sure I am, this may besaid, if thou hast any acquaintance with the sweet breathings of the spirit of God, if thou hast ever seen by tasting how good he is, or hast found what soul-anguish doth follow upon the hiding of his face from a person, who hath placed his satisfaction so entirly in the light of his countenance lifted up upon the soul, that the man cannot
<pb facs="tcp:57570:15"/>
enjoy himself, when he doth not enjoy him, but carries as one deprived of all that, which made life more desirable then death; if thou be such I say, then thou wilt finde somwhat hereto take thee: here thou wilt perceive both these conditions set before thine eye, &amp; examplified in an eminent saint: thou wilt both finde what a heaven the saints have, or is to be had in this side of glory &amp; how, as a sensible presence maks them forget all their sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, so, a felt absence doth imbitter a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l their other enjoyments.</p>
            <p>In Generall I may say this of these Epistles [&amp; it may be after thou hast perused them, thou wilt seal it] that thou hast many volumes wrapt up together in a few words, a great soul shut up in a little body, much of the marrow of real religion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed in every line: If thou be onely taken &amp; delighted with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse &amp; high-flown notions, which have not a native connexion with inflaming the heart, with love to God; but are rather the <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> of the age, being for the most part, smoak for light, or at best, a dime flash, rising out of the darkned understanding of men, whose light, till they be illuminat from above; as it arises out of a darke dungeon; so, it leads to destruction, &amp; in stead of directing the man who followes it, to a place of rest, it leads him to the pit, &amp; leaves him there to perish. If thou be taken, I say with such kinde of stuffe; I shall not bide thee, but I know thou wilt goe else where; but if thou be one, who loves not to feed upon ashes, &amp; hast no minde to fill thy belly with that east winde, which in stead of nourishment, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth nothing but much torment in the inward parts, I know thou wilt welcome this piece, as that which hath both meat &amp; medicine for thy soul in it: Here thou wilt meet with one warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the love of God, shining &amp; reflecting heat upon all that are about him, letting thee know from his own experience, what is to be found in a fellowship with God, &amp; desireous of nothing so much, as that thou &amp; others may share with him in that same love, which is better then life, &amp; be partakers of that same bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness, which made him boast of God all the day &amp; blesse him self in his afflicted lot: He would have thee taste of that, which made him cheerfull under the cross, &amp; put him in case, not onely to look, but to laugh all his troubles out of countenance: And if thou wilt but converse with him a little, it may be, thou finde
<pb facs="tcp:57570:16"/>
thy heart burne within the while thou talkest with this warme soul, whose words seem as they drop, to cast fire in the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp; set the heart in a flame. The Author in his other writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings (which have alwayes a special tincture of holyness; for even in following the most obstruse notion, &amp; apparently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot from practice, thou wilt still perceive him <hi>spirare sanctita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem)</hi> he is much above many men; but in these (how low so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever at the first look they may appear) he is above himself, being often, either as a man elevate above the pitch of mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp; caught up allready into the <hi>Quire</hi> of Angels, or as an Angel come down amongst men, shewing the inhabitants of this lower world, somwhat of that, which will be still a great se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, while we are here, to wit, what a life they live, who see God as he is, &amp; enjoy him.</p>
            <p>For the subject matter thou wilt meet with in these <hi>Epistles,</hi> I shall not say much, there is a sweet &amp; pleasant variety of purpose to be found in them, whereof thou canst onely expect a just account by a perusall of the whole; but mostly thou wilt finde these things insisted upon. 1. What high spring-tides of joy &amp; consolation, did fill &amp; overflow the soul of this sufferer, so, as sometimes ye have him expressing himself as pained with a surcharge of love [O rare &amp; blessed disease] &amp; having nothing else to seek, there are earnest longings, after a more capacious soul, to contain more of that infinit Ocean, which hath neither brime nor bottome: This is the gain of one who can suffer the loss of all things for Christ: This is the cool refres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shade that they finde in the furnace, which not onely keeps the fire of affliction from scorching them, or consuming them into ashes; but maks it a more desirable lot, then what others account the best of lives: the soul amidst these flames being admitted to such a neerness with God, as causeth joy to overflow all it's banks, &amp; perfumes the heart with delight, is so far from complaining, because of the fiery triall, that the cross of Christ is more desirable to it, then a crown: and since it is there, where nex to heaven, his people enjoy most of himself, it maks them sing sweetly amidst all the outward sorrowes that befall them, &amp; puts them in case to command a consort of Musick with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, while others in their fool's paradise, laugh as they list, have
<pb facs="tcp:57570:16"/>
sadness at their heart, &amp; finde themselves peirced through with many sorrowes. 2. Ye have sometimes a felt emptiness (for this full feast, is not, or cannot be the ordinary diet, it may well be the extraordinary disert of the people of God, while they walk by faith &amp; not by sight; the constancy of that joy, aswell as the fullness of it, is reserved for the chamber of presence, no saint how eminent soever, even in suffering for Christ, can expect, that all tears shall be wiped from his eyes, till he come to that land, where all the inhabitants have ever lasting joy upon their heads, and where he will be put beyond hazard of sinning, aswell as without the reach of suffering) there is somtimes a felt emptiness I say, that casts into a fever of desires: That river of God that is full of water, which did overflow &amp; refresh the soul, running again into that sea whence it came; &amp; in this low ebbe, ye see how the patient, is pained with absence; &amp; what a panting there is for a sensible presence; the soul as it were is evapourate in such wishes as these, O when wilt thou come unto me! Or, O when shall I come &amp; appear before thee, &amp; be put once for all, &amp; for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver beyond the fear of the arising of any cloud to eclipse the light of thy countenance! The soul in this absence, is scorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the fever &amp; flame of burning desires; but to keep it from being burnt up, there is hope, this holds the soul in life that it expire not; this saves from swooning &amp; perserves from sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into despondency: And though while hope is deferred, the heart be sick; yet there is ease in this very pain, for an unerring ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a future good, yeelds a present ease to the expectant, &amp; maks the man give himself the Check thus, why art thou cast down O my soul? This sickness was never yet unto death, but ever to the glory of God, therefore hope thou in him, for I shall yet praise him: In a word that which is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally insisted upon, in these short summaries of a communion with God, is this on the one hand, how a hungry &amp; longing soul is filled &amp; feasted with the Consolations of God, &amp; when in that posture, how pufled &amp; non-plus'd, as to what to think, or say of God: It knowes not what to doe, or how to lay out it self for him, the satisfaction that it hath in him, &amp; the obligation it sees it self under to him, making it look one very thing it doth for
<pb facs="tcp:57570:17"/>
him, sayeth or thinketh of him, with a kinde of regrate &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dissatisfaction: It doth not please it self in pleasing him, &amp; though he accept what love offers, yet love desiderats so much in the offering, that it presents all with a blush: &amp; suitable to this amiable &amp; orderly confusion of spirit, it's greatest Oratory &amp; Eloquence, is, a kinde of abrupt, concise, &amp; broken dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course: It is most desireous to speake, but not knowing what to say, which is not unworthy of him, it falls into silent admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, &amp; yet some thing it must say; wherein though, it doe not please it self; yet it maks good sense before him, &amp; is a most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent melody in his ears; it's then, when he seems to be so taken with that, wherein the soul finds so many failings &amp; defects, that he says speak on, let me see that blushing countenance, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>t me hear thy voice; <hi>for sweet is thy voice &amp; thy countenance is comely.</hi> And truely thou mayest perceive much of this kinde of discourse in these Epistles, whereto the holy writter was so ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituat in these soliloquies with God, which were ordinary to him in his retirement, that his pen, &amp; preaching, did ever after keep the tincture, &amp; had the relish of that: For while many preached notions, &amp; so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e spake because they believed; he was perceived oftimes, not so much to speake as believing; as seeing: His being so long in the mount with God, made his face to shine ever thereafter in his publike appearances: And there was some peculiar sweetness in his Phrase [especially in crying up, and commending the love of Christ: In mentioning the joy of the Holy Ghost, or the Glory of the life to come] beyond what was to be found, even with other holy men: Neither was it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the dry <hi>School-men,</hi> nor at <hi>Arestotle</hi> his feet (though there were few in the age, so well acquaint with either) that he learned this; Nay, nay, flesh and blood did not, could not reveale it unto him, he was a student above the clouds, &amp; there it was, where he learned these <hi>Metaphysicks.</hi> This I say i the thing upon the one hand which is insisted upon, &amp; on the other, thou hast the sad condition of a soul deprived of these sweet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments: He who was just now taken in to the banquetting house, &amp; had the banner of love for his canopy, hath that spiced wine which his soul was drinking with delight, snatcht out of his hand, &amp; is panting for a drop of the rivers of his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, wherein not long agoe he was bathing himself: Where
<pb facs="tcp:57570:17"/>
upon followes a night of sorrow in the soul; because the sun that did illuminat &amp; warme it, with his rayes, is set: Then, as if the soul would break forth at many passages togither, for hast to be after him, who hath withdrawn himself, it runs out at the eyes in tears, &amp; at the mouth in complaints, because of his absence; yet faith sets downe the fainter, upon the brink of the river, &amp; puts him under an arrest (that he run not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way) till the sea flow again: And desire maks him look out with a watery eye as impatient of delay, the inward <hi>Echo</hi> of the heart, in the mean time, being still this, <hi>how long wilt thou hide thy face from me? How long?</hi> &amp; while he is in thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> that is wanting &amp; away, which wa the health of his countenance, that he look pale: As the weeping man's eye, being blinded with water, cannot take up objects as they are, especially if they be at any distance; so ye have this holy man in these heavy hours, venting his jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies, &amp; because of withdrawing, giving way to his sorrow: Now, as the joy of injoying God, is by the former, made clear to be of all the greatest (for under these full manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the soul may be transported to such an extasy of delight that for the time, whether in the body, or out of the body, the man knowes not) so, the sorrow for being deprived of that, (the giver seeing it necessary, to withold &amp; suspend these ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestations, knowing that heaviness for a season through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold temptations, is fit for these, who are sons of consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; who shall have a few dayes hence, an everlasting year of Jubile) is, of all sorrowes seen to bee the sorest &amp; sharpest.

<pb facs="tcp:57570:18"/>
of that body, whereof he is head, hath excellently ordered this matter, that they who have the fullest feasts of joy, &amp; are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the neerest fellowship upon earth, to the end, that pride may be hide from their eyes; have ordinarily the deepest down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castings: These warme hours &amp; hot blenks of a sensible presence, are often followed with a sharpe showre &amp; darke night of bitter desertion; so that if poor souls in reading these, should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to think or say, Alas! We are sparingly dealt with, we are great strangers to such a favourit's feasts; let them consider also (besids that he was an Ambassadour now in bonds, &amp; so his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster allowed liberally upon him) that their soul-anguish is short of his, &amp; so, if they consider his condition well, they will see, that though he had much yet he had nothing over; &amp; if they take notice of the mercy that is in their own, they will perceive also, that though they have little yet they have no lake; for he abounds towards his, in all wisdome &amp; pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. There is a third condition spoken frequently to in these Epistles also, which lies in the middle betwixt these two: And that is, such a communion with God, as consists in the soul's being well pleased with him &amp; being most desireous to please him in all things, abstracting from these extraordinary transpotts of joy upon the one hand, &amp; free likewise of these deep down-castings upon the other: And this is the more ordinary way of the saints, whose dayly excercise it is, to come &amp; take out their directions from their Master, &amp; endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to walk according to these, both as men who are still under their Masters eye &amp; as these who must give an account of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to him: In which service, they want not their own sweet peace; for the way wherein they walk is a way of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santness, &amp; all these paths are peace; though it be not such an overflowing peace, as amounts to a joy unspeakable &amp; full of glory; for full joy is nothing else, but peace swelling without it's ordinary channel &amp; overflowing all it's banks: And on the other hand, they want not their own checks &amp; challenges, they are often before God with the tear in their eye, &amp; knowes what it is, to sigh because of a body of death within them: Because of that law which is in their members warring against that law which is in their minde, &amp; bringing them into Captivity to the
<pb facs="tcp:57570:18"/>
               <hi>law</hi> of sin, which is in their members; yet this is short of the sorrow of some dear to him, who are made to roar, by reason of the disquietness of their heart &amp; to cry out of the arrowes of the Almighty sticking within them &amp; the poison thereof drinking up their spirit; so that while they suffer this, they are with wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e <hi>Heman</hi> almost distracted. These things I say, are mainly insisted upon, which according to an epistolar method, lie scattered in severall parcells, up &amp; down the book: In read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof, thou wilt easily perceive also, that though the whole of these Epistles may be of singular use for a Christian in every condition, yet a great many of them have a more special reference, both to the comforts &amp; the carriage of a Christian under the Cross (whether his affliction be outward trouble, or inward soul-Excercise &amp; terrour) where he is most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to be found: Which is all I have to say for the matter. There are not a few in this generation I know, who will make i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> their business, &amp; think it of their interest, to derogat from the esteem which these Epistles doe justly challenge, &amp; will readily get, from all who know how to prize things according to their worth; as knowing very well, that what respect these get &amp; gain amongst readers, they lose; though I may true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say, &amp; they will at last sinde it so, that if they get the thing they seek by this artifice, they lose by that getting: &amp; I may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure my self also, if these either finde the a Christian or make thee such, they may well lose by this labour any esteem thou hadst for them, but they will not prosylite thee, to their profan contempt of so spirituall matter; yet I know they will essay it: First, somwhat to this purpose may be said &amp; will be sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested by them, that here is a needless and nauseating repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the same thing; though it may be, they are not so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased, that it is said often, as that it said at all; or if the frequenency of it offend them, it is out of a fear, that what is often said, be once listened to, &amp; at ast learned. I grant that the same matter &amp; purpose is diverse times touched &amp; insisted upon; But consider 1. that thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is to diverse persons, &amp; is there either reason or religion in it, to envy him the Liberty of telling all the fearers of God, to whom he writs, what was done for his soul, or the people of God, the advantage of that
<pb facs="tcp:57570:19"/>
relation? Was it not for the edification of the Church, that all who had heard of his persecution for the Gospel, should hear also, that the world, doe there worst, cannot make a sufferer truely miserable, while God maks him happy in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with himself: The heat of persecution may dry up, or imbitter all the nether springs, but then the soul hath free ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse to the upper, &amp; is admitted to drink yea drink abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of these rivers of his pleasure: This is the spiced wine he drinks, &amp; the meat the gets to eat in secret, which the world knoweth not of, &amp; cannot take from him; &amp; having found how sweet to the taste this bread of God, which comes down from heaven, is, he cannot forbeare to tell others, how he is feasted; to excite desires in all to come &amp; share with him in these dainties, &amp; forbeare to surffet themselves with the world's deceitfull meat 2. consider, that it is at diverse times, &amp; sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he finding the consolations of God new every morning, &amp; abounding every moment, it had been a peece of base ingratitude in him, to have made mention of that but once, which God had given him often. 3. Consider, though the same matter be often mentioned; yet it is mostly with a sweet &amp; taking va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of phrase; he brings forth the old &amp; new togither, nay, there is ever so much new in it, as may contribute to kindle new desires in the, in order to the satisfaction of thy own soul, to seek what he found, &amp; when thou hast fallen upon that, &amp; art filled with it, thy practice in telling it over to others, will, without doubt, have such a coincidency with his, as will ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify what he hath done, &amp; thou wilt then judge, that an apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for publishing &amp; frequent proclaming the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living is either wholly super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous. Or it doeth suppose the reader not be a Christian, at least in case.</p>
            <p>Secondly somthing will be said by malicious mutterers, (I know) against the apparent courseness of some phrases, and commonness of some words made use of by the Author; who all alongst sets himself, to make use of the most ordinary expressions, which are in use among the common sort of people. Something I say, of this kinde may probably be belched forth, by this carping, criticizing, profane, &amp; prejudicat age: But
<pb facs="tcp:57570:19"/>
If they would remember, what was said (by men much more knowing then themselves, &amp; more able to discerne what ought to be spoken, both as to matter &amp; words) to the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Plautus,</hi> who made use of the most common words that were in use, amongst the most common sort of people in Rome, <hi>Si ipsae Musae loquerentur ore Plautino uterentur;</hi> they would see reason, rather to commend a dexterous making use of common phrases, in writing to people of no extraordinary ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity then take, because of this, any occasion to quarrel at, or cry down, that which is so usefull &amp; excellent: And if in the opinion of men faithfull &amp; famous in their generation, he be the best preacher to a people (and consequently writter too) <hi>Qui, quam maxime trivialiter, pueriliter, populariter docet,</hi> as to words, &amp; phrases; I see no great reason such have to carpe, or necessity I have to make an Apology: But their is sufficient to be said, if not for silencing of bablers, whose tongue hath moe dimensions then their reason (which maks it not worth the while to take notice of their barking) yet for satisfying of the more sober minded. First, Consider that this disciple learned at his Master, both so to write &amp; speak, as not to hide his purpose in a cloud of new coined words: He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted his own reputation so little, while he sought his Master's honour, that he would rather seem a <hi>Babler</hi> to them, who minded nothing but words; then a <hi>Barbarian</hi> to the meanest, who was taken with spiritual matter: If <hi>Christ's</hi> example, who taught these high &amp; heavenly mysteries of salvation, by plain &amp; obvious similitudes, be not sufficient to silence such persons, who have habituat their tongue to drope satyrs against what is good, whether persons or things; yet it is enough to guard against the prejudice of what they take liberty to say. 2. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that the most common word's &amp; ordinary phrases, in use amongst a people, may, by the greatest Oratour, be very pertinently used, for illustrating &amp; pressing his purpose: Nay, in some cases, these have a special emphasis, beyond what can be wrapt up, in a great many more compt words, &amp; seemingly neat expressions, &amp; then, they are so far from being a blemish to a discourse, that they seem to give a kinde of life, &amp; adde a certain Iustre to the whole frame: &amp; thou wilt finde it often fall out here, that the Author hath so happy a dexterity in making the most
<pb facs="tcp:57570:20"/>
common (&amp; somtimes contemptible-like) phrase, with a gracefull sweetness, subservient to his purpose, that let the greatest master of words, alter but one of these words, or change one of these expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions (which if they stood not there might almost seem a <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risme)</hi> he marres what he undertooke to mend, &amp; while he endeavours to co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ct the Author, he leaves himself to be put in amongst the <hi>Errata.</hi> 3. Consider that a great many of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to whom he wrote, were no schollers, nay, had so little acquaintance With that, which passeth in the world for ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy of speech, that he had as good have said nothing at all to them, as have made use of any other words then what are pitched upon, in expressing his purpose; &amp; so his designe being to make affection, or to move it in the hearts of these to whom he wrote, there was a necessity to suit his stile to their capacity; which condescension in him, is yet managed with so much spirituall prudence &amp; discretion, as it is without debasing high matter or giving the least rational ground to mock at spiritual my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries: Yea I may say further, that there is so much majesty in the straine, as that the lowness of the stile is aboundantly thereby made up: And further, I might aske thee, if thou who maks the challenge doest pretend to be a Master of reason, whether he is the best Oratour, who can with the least noise, cast fire into the affections of these to whom he speaks or writs, &amp; bring down the highest mysteries in religion, to the capacity of the meanest hearer &amp; reader, or he who wraps up plain truths &amp; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious purposes, in such an obscurity of phrase, &amp; perplexing intricacy of words, as carryes the matter quite beyond the reach of a vulgar capacity: without making any other impression upon the minde of the hearer, then that the man hath forgotten his message, &amp; while he seeks himself, flights his Master's business: It often creats also a suspicion, that the writter or speaker either desires not to be understood, or, while he endeavours to sore too high above others, that is he hath fallen into such a confusion, as he knowes not where to finde himself? &amp; if thou concede here, what with reason thou canst not deny, thou hast granted all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thy self, which I need seek, for putting thee to silence. 4. Consider, that though there be some here written to, of the greatest quality in the Nation, &amp; a great many others, who
<pb facs="tcp:57570:20"/>
are eminent for their understanding &amp; parts, aswell as their grace; yet as these of the greatest quality &amp; parts, may reap ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, by what hath been written to the meanest &amp; most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure person; God in his providence led his servant to speak to these of understanding &amp; parts, so, that what was particularly intended for them, might be of speciall use &amp; advantage to every one: And thus all occasion of carping is taken away; unless, amongst the rest of the regularites of this time, <hi>Episcopall Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> be interposed, to make us read &amp; understand that axiome backward, <hi>bonum quo communius eo melius,</hi> which if it be; I have no more to say, but that it is of a peece with the rest of their <hi>Reformation.</hi> I suppose by this time; it may be thought, I have said too much upon this head, since it would seem that something ought rather to be said, for making many things in them plain that are mysterious &amp; darke; then to say so much for taking off prejudice, because of some common words &amp; expressions; but as to that, I shall not undertake it: For there are many things in them, onely intelligible by tasting: &amp; he who wants that commentary, will never understand this text. I have no more to say, either for the one or the other, but if any dislike them, he may let them alone; for I intend to obtrude them upon none, who distasts them; yet I cannot for bear to advise even such, so far to consult their owne reputation, as, by speaking against what the Author hath here written, not to discover that secret to the world, that they are persons void of a gracious principle, to whom the things that are of God are unsavoury: The wind of thy mouth, though accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all the venome thou canst vomit up, will not blast the Authors reputation, it will onely be a blazing of thy own shame, &amp; then thou wilt see thy self so unhappy, as to have hit the marke at which thou didst not aime: For without doing him any hurt, who is far above thy reach, thy tongue falls upon thy own head, &amp; in striking at one whom thou canst not wound, thy sword rebounds back upon thy self, &amp; enters into thine own bowells; but if thou remainest a man of imperswasion, &amp; hast so much pleasure in publishing thine own shame, I cannot help it, it is sufficient for me, to have warned thee of thy hazard; nor shall I endeavour hence forth to deprive the world
<pb facs="tcp:57570:21"/>
of their liberty (since thou wilt have it so) to look upon thee, according to the character which thou hast given of thy self, &amp; that is, <hi>Deest aliquid intus,</hi> to make the a man &amp; a Christian, &amp; since this Brutish shape pleases thee, thou mayest goe eat grasse &amp; let alone this bread, which is onely designed for Children? And so I leave thee to make use of that liberty, of saying what thou pleases, which thou hast now purchased with the loss of thy own reputation.</p>
            <p>If any think, it had been more convenient, to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed the names of these to whom the Author wrote, for some reasons obvious, in regard of the present Lamentable posture of affairs (when it is almost sufficent, to make a man guilty, that ever he was really zealous for God) I have onely this to say for my self, that I designed their honour &amp; not their preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice nor hurt in prefixing their names: Neither can I well i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine (what ever others may apprehend) what prejudice they can sustain, by this; since none, or very few of them, come from the Author, as returns to any thing they had written to him; &amp; there being no law, either discharging him to write, or any persons to receive his letters, there can be no transgression upon their part, &amp; so nothing to ground a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, or found a rational plea against them: And much less in that their names are prefixed; or if there be any thing in this blame worthy, I alone am in the transgression, who have done it without consulting themselves, or asking their consent; yet in order to the satisfaction of any, who may be offended at what is done, I have this to say for my self further, that I was induced to it, first, that thereby it might appear these were indeed the very Letters, which that faithfull sufferer &amp; witness of Jesus Christ wrote (though there is sufficient in the stile &amp; straine to put this beyond debat) &amp; no forgeries 2. many of these worthy persons being removed (whereby the Church of God is at a seen &amp; sad loss, in that she is deprived of so many, who would have weeped &amp; made supplication on her behalfe in this day of her distress, when not a few of her friends have dealt treacherously with her, &amp; are become her enemies) their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity might think themselves wronged, if I should have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived their worthy Predecessors, by suppressing their names
<pb facs="tcp:57570:21"/>
&amp; smothering their affection to the work of God, of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, of making their faithfullness known to the world: And truely, I judged it the least that was due, to the memory of these, who ought to be had in everlasting remembrance, to erect this poor monument over their grave, wherby they may live amongst the posterity, when they are gone, as persons who obtained mercy of the Lord, to be faithfull in their generation: &amp; that when the account of such comes to be taken, it may be said, this &amp; that man was borne there. 3. I did it to encourage the posterity of such, to be followers of the faith &amp; patience of their worthy proge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

As for such who are yet alive, I hope they will think, that God by this Providence, is making a honourable mention of their fidelity before the nations, &amp; is remembring for them, the Love of their espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals, when they went after him; thereby to ingage them, to cleave more closely, &amp; adhere more firmely to him, with full purpose of heart when the generality have gadded about to change their way, &amp; many of his professed disciples have gone back, &amp; are like to walk no more with him: And upon the other hand, God will have this to be a witness before the world, against any of them, who shall depart from the good way of the Lord, &amp; be offended in him, because of persecution: I hope what ever hazard threaten these who abide in Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that they will never forsake him, nor give him cause to say, <hi>what iniquity have ye found in me, that ye are gone far from me?</hi> But if it should prove otherwise, they may be sure, that he whose soul hath no pleasure in any man that draws back, &amp; hats the work of such as turne aside, will count himself ingaged in a peculiar way to lead them forth with the workers of iniquity; but we hope for better things of them all, though we thus speak: If none of these reasons which moved me to doe this be strong enough then let it be judged my weakness, for it is more fit, that I should pass in the world as such (which is no great mistake) then these honourable &amp; worthy persons, should suffer
<pb facs="tcp:57570:22"/>
any prejudice, by a deed whereto they had not the least accession.</p>
            <p>Reader, much pains hath been taken, in collecting these together, that they might be in the hands of many (a thing greatly desired of a long time by the godly) which have been hitherto onely in some broken &amp; imperfect parcells, in the hands of a few: Severall of the most correct copies that could be had, have been carefully compared, &amp; many fruits therby cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, which were crept in, by their being often transcribed, &amp; that by unskillfull hands. If it fall out so (as I suppose it shall not often be found) that they who have the Autographs by them, perceive any difference in a word or sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, betwixt this printed copy &amp; these, let them imput it to my want of he principals; for though I had a good number of them, yet it was not possible for me to get the most part: In some very few places also, to the end that this book might be of more universall use, it may be, that a scottish word, which would have darkned the sense, or ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the sentence wholly unintelligble to strangers, is either changed into some equivalent one, or a synonimous terme inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by it; but in most places these words are retained, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any alteration; because either alteration, or addition, would have made them less taking with, &amp; acceptable to them, for whom they were at first written, &amp; to these for whom they are now principally intended; because the life &amp; emphasis of the Phrase, is often found to lie, in that very word. But having kept thee under too long an arrest in the entry, I leave thee now to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruse these profitable Epistles, which are an account of the many sweet hours &amp; comfortable soliloquies which that eminent saint &amp; sufferer had with God in the furnace of his affliction: Wherein there is much to be seen, beyond the ordinary attainment of a Christian, even who hath made some remarkable progress, &amp; is no small proficient in the wayes of God. I nothing doubt; but when thou perceivest, while thou readest, how much pure zeal to God, doth burne in these lines, thou wilt Lament the lose of such a blessed instrument, now, when the Church of God is brought so very low, &amp; there are so few of all the sons whom she hath nourished &amp; brought up, to take her by the hand. I grant it is both a rational &amp; religious sorrow; for when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the many eminent lights (the removal of whom, hath

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Elbeloved and reverend Brother, grace mercy and peace be to you; upon acquaintance in Christ, I thought good to take the opportunity of writing to you; seeing it hath seemed good to the Lord of the harvest, to take the hooks out of our hands for a time, and to lay upon us a more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable service, even to suffer for his name. It were good to comfort one another in writing: I have had a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to see you in the face, yet now being the prisoner of Christ it is taken away: I am greatly comforted to hear of your soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers stately spirit, for your princely and royall Captain Jesus our Lord, and for the grace of god in the rest of our dear bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren with you; you have heard of my trouble I suppose, It hath pleased our sweet Lord Jesus, to let loose the malice of these inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted Lords in his house to deprive me of my Ministery at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woth
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57570:26"/>
and to confine me, eight score miles from thence to Aberden; and also (which vvas not done to any before) to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit me to speak at all in Jesus his name, within this Kingdome, under the paine of rebellion: The cause that ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their hatred was my book against the Arminians, whereof they accused me, these three Dayes I appeared before them; But let our crowned king in Zion raigne, by his grace the losse is theirs, the advantage is Christs and truths; albeit this honest crosse gained some ground on me; by my heavniesse, and inward Challenges of conscience for a time were sharpe, yet now for the incouragment of you all, I dare say it, and write it under my hand, welcome, welcome, sweet, svveet, Crosse, of Christ: I verely think the Chaines of my Lord Jesus are all overlaid with pure gold, &amp; that his crosse is perfumed, and that it smelleth of Christ, &amp; that the Victorie, shall be by the blood of the lamb, and by the word of his truth, and that Christ laying on his backe, in his weake servants, and oppressed truth, shall ride over his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies bellies, and shall <hi>stricke through Kings in the day of his wrath:</hi> It is time we laughe when he laugheth, and seeing he is now pleased to sit with wrongs for a time, it becometh us to be si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, untill the Lord hath let the enemies enjoy their hungerie, leane, and fecklesse paradise: Blessed are they who are content to take stroks with weeping Christ, faith will trust the Lord, and is not hastie, nor head strong; neither is faith so timorous as to flatter a tentation, or to bud and bribe the crosse, It is little up or little dovvn that the lamb and his followers can get no lavv-suitie, nor truce with crosses; it must be so, till we be up in our fathers house; my heart is woe indeed for my mother Church, that hath plaid the harlot with many lovers, her husband hath a mind to sell her for her horrible transgressions, &amp; heavy will the hand of the Lord be upon this backsliding nation. The wayes of our Zion mourne, her gold is become dim, her white Nazarites are blck like a coale, how shall not the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren weep, when the husband and the mother can not agree; yet I beleeve Scotlands skie shall clear again, &amp; that Christ shall build againe, the old wast places of Jacob, and that our dead and dry bones, shall become ane army of living men, &amp; that, our

beloved may yet feed among the lillies, untill the day breake and the shaddows flee away. My deare brother let us helpe one another with our prayers, Our king shall mowedown his enemies, and shall come from Bozra, with his garments all died in blood, and for our onsolation shall he appear, and call his wife Hephzibah, and his land Beulah; for he will rejoyce over us &amp; marie us, &amp; Scotland shall say what have I to doe any more with Idols? Only let us be faithfull to him that can ride through hell, and death, upon a windlestrae, and his horse never stumble, and let him make of me a bridge over a water so that his high and holy name may be glorified in me: stroks with the sweet mediators hand, are very sweet, he was always sweet to my soul, but since I suffered for him, his breath hath a sweeter smell then before, Oh that every hair of my head, and every member, and every bone in my bodie, were a man to witness a fair confession for him, I would think all too little for him, when I look over beyond the line, and beyond death to the laughing side of the world, I trimmph, and ride upon the high places of Jacob, howbeit otherways I am a faint dead-hearted cowardly man; oft borne down, &amp; hungry in waiting for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-supper of the lamb; neverthelesse I think it the Lords wise love that feeds us with hunger, and makes us fat with wants, and desertions: I know not my deare brother if our worthy brethren, be gone to sea, or not, they are on my heart and in my pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, if they be yet with you, salute my deare friend John Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art, my weilbeloved brethren in the Lord, Mr Blair, Mr Hamilton, Mr Livingston, and Mr Mak-Cleland, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them with my troubles, and intreat them to pray for the poor afflicted prisoner of Christ, They are deare to my soul: I seek your prayers and theirs for my flock, their remembrance breaks my heart: I desire to love that people, and others my deare acquantance in Christ with love in God, and as God loveth them; I know that he who sent me to the west, and south, sends me also to the north: I will Charge my soul to beleeve and to wait for him, and will follow his providence and not goe before it, nor stay behind it. Now my deare brother taking farewell in paper, I commend you all to the word of his grace, and to the

               <p>DEarly beloved, &amp; longed for in the Lord, my crown &amp; my joy in the day of Christ: Grace be to you, and peace, from God our father, and our Lord Jesus Christ. I long exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to know, if the oft-spoken-of match betwixt you &amp; Christ holdeth; and if you follow on to know the Lord. My day thoughts, and my night thoughts are of you, while ye sleep, I am afraid of your souls that they be off the rock: next to my Lord Jesus, and this fallen kirk, ye have the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est share of my sorrow, and also of my joy; ye are the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the tears, care, fear, and daily prayers of an oppressed prisoner of Christ: as I am in bonds for my high and lofty one, my Royall and princely master, my Lord Jesus; so I am in bonds for you, for I should have sleeped in my warme nest, &amp; kept, the fat world in my armes, and the cords of my taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle should have been fastned more strongly, I might have sung an <hi>Evangel of Ease</hi> to my soul and you for a time, with my brethren, the sons of my mother, that were angry at me, &amp; have thrust me out of the vineyard, if I should have been bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and drawn on to mire you the Lords flock; &amp; to cause you eat pastures troden upon with mens feet, and to drink foul and muddie waters: But truly the almighty was a rerror to me, &amp; his fear made me afraid. O my Lord judge if my ministry be not deare to me, but not so dear by many degrees, as Christ Jesus my Lord: God knoweth the heavie, &amp; sad Sabbaths I have bad since I laid down at my Masters feet my two shepherds staves, I have been often saying as it is writen, Lam. 3: 52. <hi>my enemies chased me sore like a bird without cause, they have cut off my life in

the dungeon &amp; cast a stone upon me:</hi> for next to Christ, I had but one joy, the apple of the eye of my delights, <hi>to preach Christ my Lord,</hi> and they have violently plucked that away from me, &amp; it was to me like the poor mans one eye, &amp; they have put out that eye, and quenched my light in the inheritance of the Lord; but my eye is toward the Lord; I know I shall see the salvation of God, and that my hope shall not alwayes be forgotten; And my sorrow shall want nothing to compleat it, and to make me say, <hi>what availeth it me to live?</hi> if ye follow the voice of a stranger, of one that cometh in to the sheepfold not by Christ the door, but climbeth up another way, if the man build his hay and stuble upon the golden foundation, <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> already laid among you, &amp; ye follow him, I assure you the mans work shall burn &amp; never bide Gods fire, and ye &amp; he both shall be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of everlasting burning, except ye repent. O if any pain, any sorrow, any losse that I can suffer for Christ, and for you were laid in pledge to buy Christs love to you, and that I could lay my dearest joyes, next to Christ my Lord in the gap, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt you &amp; eternall destruction! O if I had paper as broad as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, and inke as the sea, and all the rivers and fountaines of the earth, &amp; were able to write the love, the worth, the excellency, the Sweetnesse, and due praises of our dearest, and fairest welbeloved; and then if ye could read &amp; understand it! what could I want if my ministry among you, should make a marriage between the little bride in that bounds, &amp; the bridegroom? O how rich a prisoner were I, if I could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of my Lord (before whom I stand for you) the salvation of you all! O What a prey had I gotten to have you catched in Christs net! O then I had cast out my Lords lines &amp; his net with a rich gain! O then wel-wared pained breast and sore back, and a crased body, in speaking early and late to you! my witnesse is above, your heaven would be two heavens to me, &amp; the salvation of you all, as two salvations to me, I would subscribe a suspension, and a fristing of my heaven, for many hundred yeers, (according to Gods good pleasure) if ye were sure in the upper lodging, in our fathers house before me.

I wonder that men dow bide off Christ, I would esteem my self blessed if I could make an open proclamation, and gather all the world, that are living upon the earth, Jew, and Gentile, and all that shall be borne, to the blowing of the last trumpet, to flock round about Christ, and to stand looking, wondering, admiring, and adoring his beauty, and sweetnesse; for his fire is hotter then any other fire, his love sweeter then common love, his beauty surpasseth all other beauty: When I am heavie

               <p>DEarly beloved in our Lord, &amp; partakers of the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calling, Grace, mercy &amp; peace be to you, from God our father, &amp; from our Lord Jesus Christ: I alwayes but most of all now in my bonds (most sweet bonds for Christ my Lord) rejoyce, to hear of your faith, and love, &amp; to hear that our King, our welbeloved, our bridegroom, without tireing, stayeth still to wooe you, as his wife; and that persecutions, &amp; mockings of sinners have not chased away the wooer from the house, I perswade you in the Lord, the men of God now Scattered, &amp; driven from you; put you upon the right sent and pursuit of Christ, &amp; my salvation on it (if ten heavens were mine) if this way, this way that I now suffer for, this way that the world nicknameth, and reproacheth, &amp; no other way, be not the Kings gate to heaven; &amp; I shall never see Gods face (and alace I were a beguiled wretch if it were so) if this be not the only saving way to heaven. Oh that you would take a prisoner of Christs word for it, nay I know you have the greatest Kings word for it, that it shall not be your wisdom to spier out another Christ, another way of worshiping him, then is now savingly revealed to you. Therfore though I never saw your faces let me be pardoned to write to you ye honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able persons, ye faithfull Pastors yet amongst the flocks, and ye sincere professors of Christs truth, or any weak tired strayers who cast but halfe an eye after the bridegroom; if possibly I
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57570:31"/>
could by any weak experience, confirme and strengthen you, in this good way every where spoken against. I can with greatest assurance (to the honour of our highest, &amp; greatest &amp; dearest Lord let it be spoken) assert, (though I be but a child in Christ, and scarce able to walk, but by a hold, &amp; the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and lesse then the least of Saints) that we doe not come nigh, by twentie degrees, to the due love &amp; estimation of that fairest among the sons of men; for if it were possible that heaven yea ten heavens, were laid in the ballance with Christ, I would think the smell of his breath, above them all: sure I am he is the far best halfe of heaven, yea he is all heaven, and more then all heaven; &amp; my testimonie of him is, that ten lives of black sorrow, ten deaths, ten hells of pain, ten furnaces of brimstone, and all exquisit torments; were all too little for Christ, if our suffering could be a hire to buy him: and therefore faint not in your sufferings, &amp; hasards for him, I proclaim &amp; cry hell, sorrow, and shame upon all lusts, upon all by-lovers, that would take Christs room over his head in this little inch of love, of these narrow souls of ours that is due to sweetest Jesus. O highest, O fairest, O dearest Lord Jesus, take thine ovvn from all bastard lovers! O that vve could wodset, &amp; sell all our part of times glory and times good things, for a lease, &amp; tack of Christ for all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie! O how are we misted, and mired with the love of things that are in this side of time and in this side of deaths water! where can we finde a match to Christ, or an equal or a better then he among created things? Oh this world is out of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, &amp; all love with our welbeloved. O that I could sell my laughter, joy, ease, and all for him; and be content of a straw-bed, and btead by weight, &amp; water by measure, in the camp of our weeping Christ! I knovv his sackcloth and ashes, are better, then the fools laughter which is like the crackling of thornes under a pot. But alace we doe not harden our faces against the cold north stormes, which blow upon Christs fair face, we love well summer religion, &amp; to be that which Sin hath made us, even as thin skinned, as if we were made of white paper, &amp; would fain be carried to heaven in a cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I am charged in the Kings name, to enter against the twentie day of August next, &amp; there to remain during the Kings pleasure, as they have given it out. howbeit Christs green crosse newly laid upon me, be somewhat heavie, while I call to minde the many fair dayes, sweet &amp; comfortable to my soul, &amp; to the souls of many others, &amp; how young ones in Christ; are plucked from the breast, and the inheritance of God laid waste: yet that sweet smelled &amp; perfumed crosse of Christ, is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with sweet refreshments, with the kisses of a King, with the joy of the holy Ghost, with faith that the Lord hears the sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a prisoner, with undoubted hope (as sure as my Lord liveth) after this night, to see day light, &amp; Christs skie to clear up again upon me, &amp; his poor Kirk, &amp; that in a strange Land amongst strange faces he will give favour in the eyes of men, to his poor oppressed servant, who dow not but love that lovely one, that princely one, Jesus the comforter of his soul. All would be well if I were free of old challanges for guiltiness, &amp; for neglect in my calling, and for speaking too little for my wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloveds crown, honour, &amp; Kingdom. Oh for a day in the assembly of the saints to advocate for King Jesus! If my Lord goe on now to quarrels also, I die, I cannot endure it: but I look for peace from him, because he knoweth I dow bear mens feud but I dow not bear his feud: this is my onely exercise, that I fear I have done little good in my ministry: but I dare not but say, I loved the bai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Madam why should I smother Christs honesty, I dare not conceal his goodness to my soul, he looked fram'd and uncouth-like upon me, when I came first here; but I beleeve himself better then his looks: I shall not again quarrell Christ for a gloome, now he hath taken the mask off his face &amp; saith kisse thy fill, &amp; what can I have more, while I get great heaven in my little armes. O how sweet are the sufferings of Christ, for Christ! God forgive them that raise an ill report upon the sweet crosse of Christ, it is but our weak &amp; dim eyes, that look but to the black side that makes us mistake: these who can take that crabbed-tree hand-somely upon their back, &amp; fasten it on cannily, shall finde it such a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, as wings unto a bird, or sailes to ship. Madam rue not of your having chosen the better part: upon my salvation this is Christs truth I now suffer for, if I found but cold comfort in my sufferings, I would not beguile others, I would have told you plainly; but the truth is, Christs crown, his scepter, and the freedom of his Kingdom, is that, which is now called in question: because we will not allow that Christ pay tribute and be a vassall to the shields of the earth, therefore the sons of our mother are angry at us: but it becometh not Christ to hold any mans stir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I wish all this Nation knew how sweet his breath is, it is little to see Christ in a book, as men doe the world in a card, they talke of Christ by the book &amp; the tongue, &amp; no more; but to come nigh Christ and hausse him, &amp; embrace him, is another thing. Madam I write to your Honour for your encouragement in that honourable profession, Christ hath honoured you with: Ye have gotten the Sunny side of the brae, &amp; the best of Christs good things; he hath not given you the bastard's portion, &amp; howbeit ye get strokes &amp; sowre looks from your Lord, yet beleeve his love more then your own feeling, for this world can take nothing from you, that is truly yours, &amp; death can doe you no wrong: your rock doeth not ebbe &amp; flow, but your sea: that which Christ hath said he will bide by it, he will be your tutour, you shall not get your charters of heaven to play you with: It is good that ye have lost your cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with Christ, &amp; that Lord <hi>fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

O what sweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, what rich salvation, is laid up for these, who had rather wash and roll their garments in their own blood, then break out from Christ by Apostasie! keep your self in the love of Christ, &amp; stand far aback from the pollutions of the vvorld: side not with these times, and hold off from coming nigh the signs of a conspiracie with these, that are now come out against Christ; that ye may be One keept for Christ onely: I know your La: thinketh upon this, and how ye may be humbled for your self &amp; this backsliding land; for Iavouch, that wrath from the Lord is gone out against Scotland. I think ay the longer the better of my Royall and worthy master, he is become a new welbeloved to me now, in renewed consolations, by the presence of the spirit of grace and glory: Christs garments smell of the powder of the marchant when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out of his Ivory chambers; O his perfumed face, his fair face,

O if I could yoke in amongst the thick of Angels, &amp; Seraphims, &amp; now-glorified Saints; &amp; could raise a new love-song of Christ, before all the world!

O for an ingine to write a book of Christ and his love, nay I am left of him bound, &amp; chained with his love, I cannot finde a loosed soul to lift up his praises, and give them out to others; but oh my day light hath thick clouds, I cannot shine in his praises, I am often like a ship plying about to seek the wind, I saile at great leisure, and cannot be blowne upon that lovliest Lord. O if I could turn my sailes to Christs right arth, &amp; that I had my hearts wishes of his love! But, I but marre his praises, nay I know no comparison of what Christ is, and what his worth is, all the Angels, &amp; all the glorified, praise him not so much as in halfes, who can advance him or utter all his praises? I want nothing, unknown faces favour me, enemies must speak good of the truth, my masters cause purchaseth commendation. The hopes of my enlargement from appearances are cold, my faith hath no bed to sleep upon,

I hope ye are wrestling &amp; strugling on, in this dead age, wherin folks have lost tongue, and legs and armes for Christ. I urge upon you Madam, a neerer commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Christ and a growing communion: There are curtains to be drawn by, in Christ, that we never saw; and new fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of love in him: I despair that ever I shall win to the far end of that love, there are so many plies in it. Therefore dig deep, and sweat, and labour, and take paines for him; and set by so much time in the day for him; as you can: he will be win with labour. I, his exiled prisoner sought him, and he hath rued upon me, and hath made a moan for me, as he doth for his own, Jer. 31: 20. Isa 45: 11. and I know not what to doe with Christ, his love surroundeth, and surchargeth me.

Ye write that I am filled with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and stand not in need of these warnings, but certainly my light is dim, when it cometh to handy-grips: and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have full coffers &amp; yet empty bellies: light and the saving use of light, are far different. O What need have I to have

the ashes blowen away from my Dying-out fire! I may be a book-man, and be an Idiot &amp; stark fool in Christs way, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will not beguile Christ, the Bible beguiled the Pharasees, &amp; so may I be misted: Therefore as night watches hold one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother waking, by speaking to one another, so have we need to hold one another on foot; sleep stealeth away the light of watching, even the light that reproveth sleeping. I doubt not but moe should fetch heaven, if they beleeved not heaven to be at the next door: the worlds negative holiness, no adulter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, no murderer, no thief, no Cousiner, maketh men beleeve they are already glorified saints: but the, 6. Chap. to the, Heb: may affright us all, when we hear that men may take of the gifts, and common graces of the holy spirit, and a taste of the powers of the life to come, to hell with them: here is repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate silver which yet seemeth to have the Kings Image, and superscription upon it. 3. I finde you complaining of your self, &amp; it becometh a sinner so to doe, I am not against you in that, sense of death, is a sib friend, &amp; and of kin and blood to life, the more sense, the more life, the more sense of sin, the lesse sin. I would love my pain, &amp; sorness, &amp; my wounds, howbeit these should bereave me of my nights sleep, better then my wounds without pain. O how sweet a thing is it, to give Christ his hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of broken armes, &amp; legs, &amp; disjointed bones. 4. Be not afraid for little grace, Christ soweth his livingseed, &amp; he will not lose his seed: if he have the guiding of my stock, and state, it shall not miscarry. Our spilt works, losses, deadness, coldness, wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness; are the ground which the good husband-man labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. 5. Ye write that his compassions faile not, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that your service to Christ miscarrieth: To the which I answer: God forbid that there were buying, and selling, and blocking for as good again, betwixt Christ and us; for then free grace might goe play it, and a Saviour sing dumb, and Christ goe and sleep: but we goe to heaven with light shoulders, and all the bairn-time, and the vessels great and small that we have, are fastned upon the sure nail, Isa 23: 24. the onely danger is, that we give grace more a doe then God giveth it, that is, by turning his grace into wantonness. 6.

I know your counts are many, and will take telling, and laying, &amp; reckoning betwixt you and your Lord; fit your counts, and order them; lose not the last play, what ever ye doe; for in that play with death, your precious soul is the prize: for the Lords sake spill not the play, &amp; lose not such a treasure. Ye know out of love I had to your soul, and out of desire I had to make an honest count for you, I testified my displeasure and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking of your wayes very often, both in privat &amp; publike: I am not now a witness of your doings, but your judge is alwayes your witness. I beseech you by the mercies of God, by the salvation of your soul, by your comforts when your eye strings shall break, &amp; the face wax pale, &amp; the soul shall tremble to be out of the lodging of clay; and by your compearance before your awfull Judge, after the sight of this letter take a new course with your wayes, and now in the end of your day, make sure of heaven: examine your self if ye be in good earnest in Christ, for some, Heb. 6. 4. <hi>are partakers of the holy Ghost, &amp; taste of the good word of God, &amp; of the powers of the life to come:</hi> &amp; yet have no part in Christ at all.

howbeit I was preaching of it to you. To feel the smoke of hel's fire, in the throat, for half an hour, to stand beside a river of fire &amp; brimstone, broader then the earth, and to think to be bound hand &amp; foot, &amp; casten in the midst of it, quick, &amp; then to have God locking the prison door, never to be opened for all eternity: O how will it shake a conscience, that hath any life in it! I finde the fruits of my pains to have Christ and that people once fairly met, now meeteth my soul in my sad hours, &amp; I rejoyce that I gave fair warning of all the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, now entring in Christs house, and now many a sweet, sweet, soft kisse, many perfumed well smelled kisses, &amp; embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, have I received of my royall Master: He &amp; I have had much love together. I have for the present a sick, dwining life, with much pain, &amp; much love-sickness for Christ: O what I would give to have a bed made to my wearied soul, in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some! I would frist heaven for many yeers, to have my fill of Jesus in this life, &amp; to have occasion to offer Christ to my people: &amp; to wooe many people to Christ. I cannot tell you what sweet pain, and delight some torments are in Christs love? I often challenge time, that holdeth us sundry. I profess to you I have no rest, I have no ease while I be over head &amp; ears in lov's-ocean. if Christs love, <hi>(that fountain of delight)</hi> were laid as open to me as I would wish; O how would I drink, and drink abundantly! O how drunken would this my soul be! I half call his absence cruell, and the mask &amp; vaile on Christs face, a cruell covering, that hideth such a fair, fair face, from a sick soul. I dare not challenge himself, but his absence is a mountain of iron upon my heavie heart. O when will we meet! O how long is it to the dawning of the marriage-day! O sweet Lord Jesus take wide steps! O my Lord come over mountains at one stride! O my beloved flee like a roe, or young hart, upon the mountains of separation! O if he would fold the heavens together like an old cloak, &amp; shovle time and dayes out of the way, &amp; make ready in haste the lambs wife for her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band! Since he looked upon me, my heart is not mine own, he hath run away to heaven with it: I know it was not for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that I spake so meekle good of Christ to you in publike.

O if the heaven &amp; the heaven of heavens were paper, and the sea inke, &amp; the multitude of mountains pens of brasse, &amp; I were able to write that paper, within, and without, full of the praises of my fairest, my dearest, my loveliest, my sweetest, my matchless, and my most marrowlesse and marvellous welbelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved! woe is me I cannot set him out to men &amp; Angels. O there are few tongues to sing love-songs of his incomparable excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy! what can I poor prisoner doe to exalt him? or what course can <hi>I</hi> take to extoll my lofty, &amp; lovely Lord Jesus?

These that see his face, how dow they get their eyeplucked off him again! Lookup to him and love him, O love and live. It were life to me ifye would read this letter to that people, &amp; if they did profit by it. O if I could cause them die of love for Jesus! I charge them by the salvation of their souls, to hang about Christs neck, &amp; take their fill of his love, &amp; follow him as I taught them: part by no means with Christ; hold fast what ye have received; Keep the truth once delivered, If ye or that people quite it in an hair, or in an hoof; ye break your conscience in twain: and who then can mend it, and cast, a knot on it? my dearest in the Lord stand fast in Christ: Keep the faith; contend for Christ; wrestle for him, &amp; take mens feud for Gods favour, there is no comparison betwixt these. O that my Lord would fulfill my joy, and keep the young bride to Christ: that is at <hi>Anwoth,</hi> And now whoever they be, that have returned to the old vomit since my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture; I binde upon their back, in my masters name &amp; autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; the long-lasting weighty vengeance, and curse of God, in my Lords name I give them a doom of black, unmixed, pure wrath, which my master shall ratifie and make good, when we stand together before him: except they tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously repent, and turn to the Lord. And I write to thee, poor mourning, and broken hearted beleever, be who thou will, of the free salvation: Christs sweet balme for thy wounds, O poor humble beleever: Christs kisses for thy watery checks; Christs blood of atonement for thy guilty soul, Christs

O that people would spier out Christ, &amp; never, est while they finde him! O how shall my soul mourn in secret, if my nine yeers pained head, &amp; sore breast, and pained back, and grieved heart, and privat, &amp; publike prayers to God, shall all be for nothing among that people. Did my Lord Jesus send me but to summond you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your judge, &amp; to leave your summonds at your houses? was I sent as a witness onnly to gather your dittay's.

I told you often of wrath, wrath from the Lord, to come upon Scotland, and yet I bide by my Masters word; it is quickly coming, desolation for Scotland, because of the quarrell of a broken covenant. Now worthy Sir, now my dear people, my joy, and my crown in the Lord, let him be your fear, seek the Lord, and his face, save your souls: doves flee to Christs windows: pray for me, &amp; praise for me.

It is but his boundless wisdom, who hath taken the tutouring of his witlesse childe, and he knoweth, to be drunken with comforts, is not safest for our stomackes: However it be, the din and noise and glooms of Christs crosse, are weightier then it self. I protest to you (my witnesse is in heaven) I could wish many pound weights added to my crosse, to know that by sufferings, Christ were set forward in his kingly office in this Land. Oh what is my skin to his glory, Or my losses, or my sad heart, to the apple of the eye of our Lord, &amp; his beloved spouse, his precious truth, his royal priviledges, the glory of manifested justice in giving of his foes a dash, the testimony of his faithfull servants, who doe glorifie him when he rideth upon poor weak wormes, &amp; triumpheth in them! I desire you to pray that I may come out of this furnace with honesty, &amp; that I may leave Christs truth no worse then I found it, &amp; that this most honourable cause, may neither be stained, nor weakned. As for your case my Reverend and Dearest Brother, ye are the talking of the North and South; &amp; looked to so, as if ye were all crystall glasse, your mots and dust should soon be proclaimed, &amp; trumpets blowne at your slips: But I know ye have laid help upon one that is mighty.

               <p>MY very noble &amp; honourable Lord, Grace, mercy and peace be to you, I make bold to write to your Lo: that you may know the honourable cause ye are graced to prosesse, is Christs own truth. Ye are many wayes blessed of God, who hath taken upon you, to come out to the strects, with Christ on your fore-head; when so many are ashamed of him, and hide him (as it were) under their cloak, as if he were a stolen Christ. If this faithless generation, (and especially the Nobles of this Kingdom,) thought not Christ dear wares, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion expensive, hazardous, and dangerous, they would not slip from his cause as they doe and stand looking on, with their hands folded behinde their back; when lowns are running away with the spoile of Sion on their back, and the boards of the Son of Gods tabernacle. Law and Justice are to be had to any, especially for money, &amp; moyen; but Christ can get no law, good cheap nor dear. It were the glory and honour of you who are the Nobles of this land, to plead for your wronged bridegroom, and his oppressed Spouse, as far as zeal &amp; standing law will goe with you. Your ordinary logicke from the event <hi>(that it will doe no good)</hi> to the cause <hi>(and therefore silence, is
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57570:48"/>
best, till the Lord put to his own hand)</hi> it is not (with reverence of your Lo: Learning) worth a straw: Events are Gods, let us doe, and not plead against Gods Office, let him sit at his own helme who moderateth all events. It is not a good course to complain that we cannot get a providence of gold, when our lasiness, cold zeal, temporizing, and faithless fearfulness spil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth good providence. Your Lo: will pardon me, I am not of that minde, that tumults or armes is the way to put Christ on his throne, or that Christ will be served &amp; truth vindicated onely with the arme of flesh and blood: nay, Christ doeth his turn with lesse din then with garments rolled in blood. But I would, the zeal of God were in the Nobles, to doe their part for Christ: and I must be pardoned to write to your Lo: this: I dow not, I dare not but speak to others, what God hath done to the soul of his poor, afflicted, exiled prisoner: his comfort is more then I ever knew before, he hath sealed the honourable cause I now suffer for, &amp; I shall not beleeve that Christ will put his <hi>Amen</hi> &amp; ring upon an imagination: he hath made all his promises good to me, and hath filled up all the blanks with his own hand: I would not exchange my bonds with the plaistered joy of this whole world. It hath pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to make a sinner the like of me, an ordinary ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetter in his house of wine, with that royall Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one Christ Jesus. O what weighing! O what tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is in his love! how sweet must he be, when that black and Burdensome tree, his own crosse, is so perfumed with joy and gladness! O for help to lift him up by praises, on his royall throne! I seek no more but that his name may be spread abroad in me, that meekle good may be spoken of Christ on my behalf: this being done, my losses, place, stipend, credit, case, and Liberty, shall all be made up to my full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, and joy of heart. I will be confident your Lo: Will goe on in the strength of the Lord and keep Christ &amp; avouch him, that he may read your name publikly before men &amp; Angels. I wil entreat your Lo: to exhort &amp; encourage that Nobleman your Chief to doe the same: but I am woe, many of you finde a new wisdom, which deserveth nor such a name;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57570:48"/>
it were better that men should see, that their wisdom be holy &amp; their holiness wise: I must be bold to desire your Lo: To adde to your former favours to me (for the which your Lo: hath a prisoners blessing &amp; prayers) this, that ye would be pleased to befriend my brother, now suffering for the same cause. For he is to dwell nigh your Lo: Bounds; your Lo: word &amp; countenance may help him. Thus recommending your Lo: to the saving grace &amp; tender mercy of Christ Jesus our Lord. I rest.</p>

               <p>GRace, mercy &amp; peace be to you: I am well, my Lord Jesus is Kinder to me then ever he was, it pleaseth him to dine &amp; sup with his afflicted prisoner, a King feasteth me, and his spiknard casteth a sweet smell. Put Christs love to the triall and put upon it burdens, &amp; then it will appear love indeed: we employ not his love, &amp; therefore we know it not. I verily count more of the sufferings of my Lord, then of this worlds lustred &amp; overguilded glory: I dare not say but my Lord Jesus hath fully recompensed my sadness, with his joyes: my losses, with his own presence: I finde it a sweet &amp; rich thing to exchange my sorrows with Christs joyes, my afflictions with that sweet peace I have with himself. Brother this is his own truth I now suffer for, he hath sealed my sufferings with his own comforts; &amp; I know he will not put his seal upon blank paper; his seals are not dumb, nor delusive, to confirm imaginations &amp; lyes. Goe on my dear Brother in the strength of the Lord, not fearing man that is a worm, or the son of man that will die. Providence hath

a thousand keys to open a thousand sundry doors, for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of his own, when it is even come to a <hi>conclamatum est:</hi> Let us be faithfull and care for our own part, which is to doe &amp; suffer for him, &amp; lay Christs part on himself, &amp; leave it there: du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are ours, events are the Lord's: when our faith goeth to medle with events &amp; to hold a court (if I may so speak) upon Gods providence (and begineth to say, <hi>how wilt Thou do this, &amp; that?)</hi> we lose ground: we have nothing to doe there, it is our part to, let the Almighty exerce his own office, and stir his own helme: there is nothing left to us but to see how we may be approved of him, and how we may roll the weight of our weak souls (in wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing) upon him who is <hi>God Omnipotent:</hi> and when, what we thus essay, miscarrieth; it shall neither be our sin nor cross. Brother, remember the Lord's word to Peter, Simon, lovest thou me? Feed my sheep: no greater testimony of our love to Christ can be, then to feed painfully and faithfully his lambs. I am in no better neighbourhood with the Ministers here then before; they cannot endure that any speak of me, or to me: thus I am in the mean time silent, (which is my great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est grief.) Dr Barron hath often disputed with me, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about Arminian-controversies, and for the Ceremonies: three yokings laid him by, and I have not been troubled with him since: now he hath appointed a dispute before witnesses; I trust Christ and truth shall doe for themselves. I hope Brother ye will help my people, and write to me what ye hear the Bishop is to doe to them: Grace be with you.</p>

as the dew of herbs, I am most secure in this prison, salvation is for walls in it, and what think ye of these walls? he maketh the dry plant to bud as the lilie, and to blossome as Lebanon. the great husband man's blessing cometh down upon the plants of righteousness, who may say this (my dear Brother) if I, his poor exiled stranger, &amp; prisoner may not say it? Howbeit all the world should be silent I cannot hold my peace. O how many black counts hath Christ and I rounded over together, in the house of my pilgrimage! and how sat a portion hath he given to a hungry soul? I had rather have Christs <hi>four-hours,</hi> then have dinner and Supper both in one from any other; his dealing, and the way of his judgements passe finding out: No preaching, no book; no learning could give me that, which I behooved to come and get in this Town, but what of all this, if I were not misted, confounded, and astonished how to be thankfull, and how to get him praised for evermore? And which is more, he hath been pleased to pain me with his love, and my pain groweth through want of reall possession. Some have written to me that I am possibly too joyfull of the cross, but my joy over-leapeth the cross, it is bounded and terminat upon Christ: I know the sun will over-cloud &amp; eclipse, and I shall again be put to walk in the shaddow, but Christ must be welcome to come and goe as he thinketh meet; yet he would be more welcome to me I trow, to come then goe, &amp; I hope he pitieth and pardoneth me, in casting apples to me, at such a fainting time as this, holy and blessed is his name. It was not my flattering of Christ, that drew a kiss from his mouth, but he would send me as a spie into this wilderness of suffering, to see the land, and to try the foord, and I cannot make a lye of Christs cross; I can report nothing but good both of him, &amp; it, lest others should faint. I hope when a change cometh, to cast anchor at midnight upon the rock (which he hath taught me to know in this day light) whether I may run, when I must say my lesson without book, &amp; beleeve in the dark. I am sure it is sin to tarrow of Christs good meat, &amp; not to eat when he saith, eat <hi>O welbeloved &amp;, drink abundantly.</hi>

I desire he may get the fruit of praises for dâting, and thus dandling me upon his knee, &amp; I may give my bond of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness; sobeing I have Christ's back-bond again for my relief, that I shall be strengthned by his powerfull grace, to pay my vowes to him. But truly I finde we have the advantage of the brae upon our enemies, we are more then conquerours through him who hath loved us, &amp; they know not wherein our strength lieth.

               <p>GRace, mercy &amp; peace be unto you: the Lord hath brought me to Aberd: where I see God in few. This town hath been advised upon of purpose for me: It consisteth either of Papists, or men of Gallio's naughtie faith, it is counted wisdom in the most, not to countenance a confined Minister, but I finde Christ neither strange nor unkind; for I have found many faces smile upon me since I came hither. I am heavie and sad, considering what is betwixt the Lord &amp; my soul, which none seeth but he. I finde men have mistaken me, it would be no art (as I now see) to spin small, and make hypocrisie, seem a goodly web, and to goe through the mercat as a saint among men, &amp; yet steal quietly to hell, without observation: So easie is it to deceive men. I have disputed whether or noe I ever knew any thing of Christianity, save the letters of that name: Men see but as men, and they call ten twenty, and twenty, an hundred, but O to be approved of God in the heart, &amp; in sincerity, is not an ordinary mercy: my neglects while I had a pulpit, &amp; other things whereof I am ashamed to speak, meet me now,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57570:50"/>
so, as God maketh an honest cross, my daily sorrow, and for fear of scandal and stumbling, I must hide this day of the law's pleading: I know not, if this court kept within my soul, be fenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Christ's name. If certainty of salvation were to be bought, God knoweth, if I had ten earths, I would not prig with God. like a fool, I beleeved, under suffering for Christ, that I my self should keep the key of Christ's treasures, and take out comforts, when I listed, and eat, and be fat: But I see now, a sufferer for Christ, will be made to know himself, and will be holden at the door, as well as another poor sinner; and will be fain to eat with the bairns, and to take the by-board, and glad so: my blessing on the cross of Christ, that hath made me see this. Oh if we could take pains for the Kingdom of heaven, but we sit down upon some ordinary markes of God's children; thinking we have as much as will seperat us from a Reprobat, and thereupon we tak the play, and cry <hi>Holy-day:</hi> &amp; thus the devil casteth water on our fire, &amp; blunteth our zeal and care: but I see heaven is not at the next door: &amp; I see howbeit my challenges be many; I suffer for Christ, &amp; dare hazard my salvation upon it, for some times my Lord cometh with a fair hour, &amp; O but his love be sweet, delightfull, &amp; comfortable! half a kiss is sweet, but our doting love will not be content of a right to Christ, unless we get pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession; like the man who will not be content of rights to bought land, except he get also the ridges, and acers laid upon his back, to carry home with him. However it be, Christ is wise, and we are fools; to be browden and fond of a pawne in the loof of our hand: living on trust by faith, may well content us. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam I know your La: knoweth this, and that made me bold to write of it, that others might reap some what by my bonds for the truth, for I should desire, and I aime at this, to have my lord well spoken of and honoured, howbeit he should make nothing of me, but a bridge over a water. Thus recommending your La: your son, and children to his grace, who hath honoured you with a name and room among the living in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, and wishing Grace to be with your La: I rest.</p>

               <p>GRace, mercy and peace be unto you: I finde great men, especially old friends skar to speak for me, but my kingly &amp; Royall Master biddeth me try his moyen to the uttermost, &amp; I shall finde a friend at hand: I still depend on him, his court is as before, the prisoner is welcome to him, the black crab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed tree of my Lord's cross hath made Christ and my soul very entire, he is my song in the night: I am often laid in the dust with challenges and apprehensions of his anger, and then if a mountain of iron were laid upon me, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be heavier: and with much wrestling I win in to the Kings house of wine, and for the most part my life is joy, and such joy through his comforts, as I have been afraid to shame my self, and to cry out, for I can scarce bear what I get: Christ giveth me a measure heaped up, pressed down, and running over: and beleeve it, his love paineth me more then prison and banishment. I cannot get a gate of Christ's love, had I known what he was keeping for me, I would never have been so faint-hearted. In my heaviest times when all is lost, the memory of his love maketh me think Christ's gloomes are but for the fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: I seek no more but a vent to my wine, I am smother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ready to burst for want of a vent. Think not much of persecution, it is before you, but it is not as men conceive of it, my suggared-cross forceth me to say this to you, ye shall have wailed meat, the sick bairn is often times the spilt ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I am not cast down to goe further North, I have good cause to work for my Master, for I am well paid before the hand, I am not behinde, howbeit I should not get one

The Brethren of Ireland write not to me; chide with them for that, I am sure that I may give you and them a commission (and I will bide by it) that you tell my beloved, I am sick of love. I hope in God to leave some of my rust, and superfluites in Aberd: I cannot get an house in this town wherein to leave drink-silver in my Master's name, save, one onely, there is no sale for Christ in the North, he is like to lie long on my hand ere any accept him.

               <p>REverend and dear brother, I am a very far misstaken man, if others knew how poor my stock were, they would not think upon the like of me, but with compassion; for I am as one kept under a strict Tutour: I would have more then my Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour alloweth upon me, but it is good that a bairns wit is not the rule which regulateth my Lord Jesus: let him give what he will it shall ay be above merit, &amp; my ability to gain therewith. I would not wish a better stock (while heaven be my stock) then to live upon credit at Christs hands, daily borrowing: surely run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning over love, that vast, hudge, boundlesse love of Christ (that there is telling in for man and Angel) is the onely thing, I fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est would be in hands with: He knoweth I have little but the love of that love, &amp; that I shall be happy, suppose I never get another heaven, but onely an eternall lasting feast of that love: but suppose my wishes were poor, He is not poor; Christ all the seasons of the yeer is dropping sweetnesse, if I had vessels I might fill them, but my old riven, holly, and running out dish, even when I am at the well, can bring little away: Nothing but Glory will make tight, and fast, our looking and rifty vessels. Alace I have skailed more of Christs Grace, love, faith,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57570:52"/>
humility, and godly sorrow, then I have brought with me. How little of the sea can a childe carry in his hand, as little dow I take away, of my great sea, my boundlesse &amp; Runing-over-Christ-Jesus: I have not lighted upon the right gate of puting Christ to the banke, &amp; making my self rich with him: my misguiding and childish trafficking, with that matchlesse pearl, That heaven's jewell, the jewell of the fathers delights, hath put me to a great losse. O that he would take a loan of me, &amp; my stock, and put his name in all my bonds, and serve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self Heir to the poor mean portion I have: &amp; be countable for the talent himself! gladly would I put Christ in my room, to guide all; and let me be but a servant to run errands, &amp; doe by his direction, let me be his interdicted heir: Lord Jesus, work upon my minority, &amp; let him win a pupil's blessing. Oh how would I rejoyce to have this work of my salvation legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fastned upon Christ! a back-bond of my Lord Jesus that it should be forthcoming to the Orphan, should be my happinesse: dependency on Christ, were my surest way: if Christ were my bottome I were sure enough. I thought guiding of grace had been no art, I thought it would come of will; but I would spill my own heaven yet, if I had not burdened Christ with <hi>All:</hi> I but lend my bare name to the sweet covenant, Christ behinde &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, &amp; on either side, maketh all sure: God will not take an Arminian-cautioner <hi>Freewill,</hi> a weather-cock, turning at a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents tongue, a Tutor that couped our father Adam unto us, &amp; brought down the house, &amp; sold the Land, &amp; sent the father, &amp; mother, &amp; all the bairns through the earth, to beg their bread: nature in the Gospel hath cracked credit. O well to my poor soul for evermore, that my Lord called grace to the councel &amp; put Christ Jesus with free merits, &amp; the blood of God fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in the chase, to draw sinners after a ransomer. O what a sweet block was it, by way of buying &amp; selling, to give and tell down a ransome for grace, &amp; glory to Dyvours! O would to my Lord, I could cause paper and ink speak the worth and excellencie, the high, &amp; loud praises of a Brother-ransomer! O the Ransomer needs not my report, but oh if he would take it, &amp; make use of it: I should be happy if I had an errand to this
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57570:52"/>
world but for some few yeers, to spread proclamations &amp; out-crys, &amp; love-letters, of the highnes [the highnes for evermore] the glory (the glory for evermore) of the Ransomer, whose cloaths were wet, &amp; died in blood; howbeit that after I had done that, my soul &amp; body should goe back to the mother <hi>nothing,</hi> that their Creator brought them once out from, as from their beginning. But why should I pine away, and pain my self with wishes, &amp; not beleeve rather, that Christ will hire such an out-cast as I am, a masterlesse-body, put out of the house, by the sons of my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; give me employment, and a calling, one way, or other, to out Christ, and his wares, to countrey buyers, &amp; propose Christ unto, &amp; presse him upon some poor souls, that fainer then their life would receive him. You complain heavily, of your short coming in practice, and venturing on suffering for Christ: you have many marrowes. For the first, I would not put you off sense of wretcheduesse, hold on, Christ never yet slew a sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hing, groaning childe; more of that would make you won goods, and a meet prey for Christ, Alace I have too little of it! For venturing on suffering; I had not somuch free gier, when I came to Christs camp, as to buy a sword, a wonder that Christ should not laugh, at such a souldier: I am no better yet; but faith liveth &amp; spendeth upon our Captains charges, who is able to pay for all: we need not pitie him, he is rich enough. Ye desire me also not to mistake Christ under a mask, I blesse you &amp; thank God for it, but alace masked or bare-faced, kissing or glooming I mistake him! yea I mistake him furthest when the mask is off; for then I play me with his sweetness: I am like a childe that hath a golden book, that playeth more with the rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bens, and the guilding, &amp; the picture in the first page; then readeth the contents of it. Certainly, if my desires, to my wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloved, were fulfilled, I could provoke divels, and crosses, &amp; the world, &amp; tentations to the fields: but oh my poor weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, makes me, lie behinde the bush and hide me, Remember my service and my blessing to my Lord; I am mindfull of him as I am able: desire him from a prisoner, to come &amp; visite my good master, &amp; feel but the smell of his love: it sets him well howbeit he be young, to make Christ his garland. I could not

I marvel not my dear sister, that ye complain that ye come short of your old wrestlings you had for a blessing, and that now you finde it not so, bairns are but hired to learn their lesson when they first goe to school; and it is enough that these who run a race see the gold onely at the starting place; and possibly they see little more of it, or nothing at all, till they win to the rink's-end and get the gold in the loof of their hand: Cur Lord maketh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licates and dainties of his sweet presence and love-visits to his own, but Christs love under a vaile is love, if ye get Christ, howbeit not the sweet and pleasant way you would have him, it is enough, for the wel-beloved cometh not our way, he must waile his own gate himself. For worldly things, seeing they are medows and fair flowers in your way to heaven, a smell in the by-going is sufficient: he that would reckon and tell all the stones in his way, in a journey of three or four hundred miles, and write up in his count book all the herbs, and flowers growing in his way, might come short of his journey, you cannot stay in your inch of time to lose your day (seeing you are in haste, and the night and your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-noon will not bide you) in setting your heart on this vain world, it were your wisdom to read your count book &amp; to have in readin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is easie to get good words, and a comfortable message from our Lord, even from such rough serjeants, as diverse temptations: Thanks to God for crosses, when we count and reckon our losses in seeking God, we finde godliness is great gain. Great partners of a shipfull of gold, are glad to see the ship come to the harbour: surely we and our Lord Jesus together, have a shipfull of gold coming home, and our gold is in that ship. Some are so in love (or rather in lust) with this life, that they sell their part of the ship, for a little thing; I would counsel you to buy hope, but sell it not, and give not away your crosses for nothing, the inside of Christs crosse is white and joyfull, and the far end of the black crosse is a fair and glorious heaven of ease: and seeing Christ hath fastned heaven to the far end of the crosse, &amp; he will not loose the knot him self, &amp; none else can, (for when Christ casteth a knot all the world cannot loose it) let us then count it exceeding joy when we fall into diverse temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. Thus recommending you to the tender mercy, &amp; grace of our Lord I rest.</p>

               <p>I Wrote of late to you: multitudes of letters burden me now. I am refreshed with your letter: I exhort you in the bowels of Christ, set to work for your soul, &amp; let these bear weight with you, and ponder them seriously. 1.

is not gone down. 4. Consider what joy &amp; peace is in Christs service. 5. Think what advantage it will be to have Angels, the world, life, &amp; death, crosses, yea and devils, all for you, as the Kings serjeants, and servants, to doe your bussinesse. 6. To have mercy on your seed, &amp; a blessing on your house. 7. To have true honour, &amp; a name on earth: that casts a sweet smell. 8. How ye will rejoyce when Christ layeth down your head under his chinne, &amp; betwixt his brests, &amp; dryeth your face, &amp; welcometh you to glory &amp; happyness? 9. Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, what pain, &amp; torture is a guilty conscience? What slavery to carry the Devils unhonest loads? 10. Sins joyes are but night-dreames, thoughts, vapours, imaginations and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes. 11. What dignity it is to be a son of God? 12. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and mastery over tentations, over the world, and sin. 13. That your enemies should be the taile, and you the head. For your bairns now at their rest, I speak to you and your wife (and cause her read this.) 1. I am a witness of <hi>Barbara's</hi> glory in heaven. 2. For the rest, I write it under my hand, there are dayes coming on Scotland, when barren wombs &amp; dry breasts, and childless parents, shall be pronounced blessed: they are then in the lee of the harbour, ere the storm come on. 3.

My dearest in Christ, I write my souls desire to you: heaven is not at the next door: I finde Christianity an hard task: set to it in your evening: we would all keep both Christ &amp; our right eye, our right hand &amp; foot; but it will not be with us. I beseech you, by the mercies of God; and your compearance before Christ, look Christs count book and your own together, and collation them: give the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of your time to your soul: this great Idol-god, the world, will be lying in white ashes, in the day of your compearance; &amp; why should night-dreames, and day-shaddowes &amp; water-froth, &amp; May-flowers run away with your heart: when we win to the water-side, and black deaths river brinke, and put our foot in the boat, we shall laugh at our folly, Sir, I recommend you unto the thoughts of death, and how ye would wish your soul to be, when ye shall lie cold, blew, ill-smelling clay. For any hireling to be intruded, I being the Kings prisoner can not say much, but as Gods minister I desire you to read, Act. 2, 15, 16. to the end, &amp; Act. 6. 2, 3, 4, 5. &amp; ye shall finde God's people, should have a voice in chusing Church-rulers &amp; teachers.

               <p>GRace, mercy and peace be to you. Your letters give a dash to my laziness in writing: I must first tell you, there is not such a glassie, Icie, &amp; slippery piece of way, betwixt you
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57570:55"/>
and heaven as Youth: I have experience to say with me here, and seal what I assert: the old ashes of the sins of my youth, are new fire of sorrow to me: I have seen the Devil, as it were, dead &amp; buried, &amp; yet rise again &amp; be a worse Devil then ever he was. Therefore, my brother, beware of a green young Devil that hath never been buried: the Devil in his flowers (I mean, the hot fiery lusts &amp; passions of youth) is much to be feared: better yoke with an old gray-haired, withered, dry Devil: For in youth he findeth dry sticks, &amp; dry coals, and an hot hearth-stone, and how soon can he with his flint cast fire, and with his bellows blow it up, and fire the house: sanctified thoughts, thoughts made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of, and called in, and kept in aw, are green fewel, that burn not, &amp; are a water for Satans coal. Yet I must tell you, the whole saints now triumphant in heaven and standing before the throne, are nothing but Christs forlorn and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly Dyvours: What are they but a pack of redeemed sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? But their redemption is not onely past the seals, but compleated, and yours is on the wheels, and in doing: All Christs good bairns go to heaven with a broken brow, and with a crooked leg. Christ hath an advantage of you, and I pray you let him have't, he shall finde employment for his calling in you: if it were not with you as you write, grace should finde no sale nor mercat in you; but ye must be content to give Christ somewhat adoe: I am glad that he is employed that way: let your bleeding soul, and your sores be put in the hand of this expert physician: let young and strong corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and his free grace be yoked together, and let Christ &amp; your sins deal it betwixt them. I will be loath to put you off your fears, and your sense of deadness: (I wish it were more) there be some wounds of that nature, that their bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing should not be soon stoped: ye must take a house beside the Physician, it shall be a miracle if ye be the first sick man he put away uncured, &amp; worse then he found you: nay, nay, Christ is honest, and in that flyting free with sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners (Ioh. 6. 37. <hi>And him that cometh to me, I will in no, case cast out)</hi> Take ye that: It cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57570:56"/>
to take that as your own, when ye find your wounds stound you, presumption is ever whole at the heart, and hath but the truant-sickness, and groaneth onely for the fashion: faith hath sense of sickness, and looketh like a friend to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and looking to Christ therein, is glad to see a known face. Christ is as full a feast, as ye can have to hunger: nay Christ, I say, is not a full mans leavings; his mercy sends al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a letter of defiance to all your sins, if there were ten thousand moe of them. I grant you, it is a hard matter for a poor hungry man, to win his meat upon hidden Christ, for then the key of his pantrie door, and of the house of wine is a seeking, &amp; cannot be had; but hunger must break thorow iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks. I be moan them not who can make a din, &amp; all the fields adoe, for a Lost Saviour: ye must let him hear it (to say so) upon both the sides of his head, when he hideth himself: it is no time then to be bird-mouth'd and patient. Christ is rare indeed, and a delicate to a sinner; he is a miracle and a world's wonder, to a seeking and a weeping sinner, but yet such a miracle, as will be seen by them, who will come and see: the seeker, and sigher is at last a singer and enjoyer: nay, I have seen a dumb man get an almes from Christ. He that can tell his tale, and send such a letter to heaven, as he hath sent to Aberden, it is very like he will come speed with Christ. It bodeth Gods mercy to complain heartily for sin. Let wrestling be with Christ till he say, <hi>How is it, Sir, that I cannot be quite of your bills, &amp; your misl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is also meet ye should know by experience, that faith is not natur's il gotten bastard, but your Lords free gift, that lay in the womb of Gods free grace, praised be the winner. I may adde a 4. In the passing of your bill, &amp; your charters, when they went through the Mediators great seal, and were concluded, faith's advice was not sought: saith hath not a vote beside Christs merits, blood, blood, dear blood that came from your cautioners holy body, maketh that sure work. The use then which ye have of faith now, (having already closed with Jesus Christ for ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification) is, to take out a copy of your pardon; &amp; so ye have peace with God, upon the account of Christ: for since faith apprehendeth pardon, but never payeth a penny for it, no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel that Salvation doeth not die and live, ebbe, or flow, with the working of faith, but because it is your Lords honour to beleeve his mercy, and his fidelity, it is infinit goodness in our Lord, that misbeleef giveth a dash to our Lords glory, and not to our Salvation: and so who ever want (yea, howbeit God here bear with the want of what we are obliged to give him, even the glory of his grace, by beleeving, yet) a poor covenanted sinner wanteth not: but if guiltiness were removed, doubtings would find no friend, nor life; and yet faith is to beleeve the removal of guiltiness, in Christ. A reason why ye get less now (as ye think) then before (as I take it) is, because at our first conversion, our Lord putteth the meat in young bairns mouthes, with his own hand, but when we grow to some further perfection, we must take heaven by violence, and take by violence from Christ, what we get; and he can, and doeth hold, because he will have us to draw.

               <p>GRace, mercy &amp; peace be to you: I have seen no letter from you since I came to <hi>Aberdeen;</hi> I will no tinterpret it to be forgetfulness. I am here in a fair prison, Christ is my sweet &amp; honourable fellow-prisoner, &amp; I his sad &amp; joyful Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoner, [if I may speak so.] I think this cross becometh me well, &amp; is suitable to me in respect of my duty to suffer for Christ; howbeit not in regard of my deserving, to be thus honoured. However it be, I see Christ is strong, even lying in the dust, in prison, and in banishment. Losses &amp; disgraces are the wheels of Christs triumphing chariot. In the sufferings of his own saints, as he intendeth their good, so he intendeth his own glory, &amp; that is the butte his arrowes shoot at, &amp; Christ shooteth not at the tovers, he hitteth what he purposeth to hit: Therefore he doeth make his own feckless &amp; weak nothing's, &amp; these who are the contempt of men, a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth, to thresh the mountains, &amp; beat them small, &amp; to make the hills as chaff, &amp; to fan them. Isa. 51: 15, 16. What harder stuff, or harder grain for threshing out, then high and rockie mountains? But the Saints are
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57570:58"/>
Gods threshing instruments to beat them all in chaff: are we not Gods leem vessels, &amp; yet when they cast us over an house, we are not broken in sheards: we creep in under our Lords wings in the great shower, &amp; the water cannot goe thorow these wings. It is folly then for men to say, this is not Christs plea, he will lose the wed-fee, men are like to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile him: that were indeed a strange play. Nay I dare pledge my soul, &amp; lay it in pawne on Christs side of it, &amp; be half-tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er half-winner with my Master: Let fools laugh the fools<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laughter, &amp; scorn Christ, &amp; bid the weeping captives in Babylon, sing us one of the songs of Zion, play a spring to chear up your sad-hearted God: We may sing upon lucks head before hand, even in our winter-storme, in the expectation of a summer-sun at the turn of the yeer: no created powers in hell or out of hell, can mar our L. Jesus his musick, nor spill our song of joy: let us then be glad &amp; rejoyce in the salvation of our Lord; for faith had never yet cause to have wet cheeks, &amp; hinging<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down browes, or to droup or die: what can aile faith, seeing Christ suffereth himself, (with reverence to him be it spoken) to be commanded by it; &amp; Christ commandeth all things: faith may dance, because Christ sings, &amp; we may come in the Quite &amp; lift our hoarse &amp; rough voices, &amp; chirp, &amp; sing, &amp; shout for joy with our Lord Jesus. We see oxen goe to the shambles leaping &amp; startling; We see Gods fed oxen prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the day of slaughter, goe dancing &amp; singing down to the black chambers of hell; &amp; why should we goe to heaven weeping, as if we were like to fall down thorow the earth for sorrow. If God were dead (if I may speak so, with reverence of him ho liveth for ever &amp; ever) &amp; Christ buried, &amp; rotten among the worms, we might have cause to look like dead folks; but, <hi>the Lord liveth &amp; blessed be the rock of our salvation,</hi> Psal. 18: 46. None have right to joy but we, for joy is sown for us, &amp; an ill summer or harvest will not spill the crop. The children of this world have much robbed joy that is not well come: It is no good sport they laugh at: They steall joy, as it were, from God; for he commandeth them to mourn &amp; howle: Then let us claim our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

joy. <hi>My dear Brother,</hi> I cannot but speak what I have felt, seeing my Lord Jesus hath broken a box of spikenard upon the head of his poor prisoner, &amp; it is hard to hide a sweet smell; it is pain to smother Christs love, it will be out; whether we will or not. If we did but speak according to the matter; a cross for Christ should have another name; yea a cross, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when he cometh with his arms full of joyes, is the happiest hard tree that ever was laid upon my weak shoulders. Christ &amp; his cross together are sweet company &amp; a blessed couple. My prison is my palace my sorrow is with childe of joy, my losses are rich losses, my pain easie pain, my heavie dayes are holy &amp; happy dayes. I may tell a new tale of Christ to my friend. Oh if I could make a love-song of him, &amp; could commend Christ &amp; tune his praises aright! O if I could set all tongues in great Britain &amp; Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to work, to help me to sing a new song of my welbeloved! O if I could be a bridge over a water for my Lord Jesus to walk upon &amp; keep his feet dry! O if my poor bit heaven could goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt my Lord &amp; blasphemy &amp; dishonour! (upon condition he loved me] O that my heart could say this word &amp; bide by it for ever. Is it not great art &amp; incomparable wisdom in my Lord, who can bring forth such fair apples, out of this crabbed tree of the cross! nay my fathers never enough admired providence, can make a fair feast out of a black Devil: nothing can come wrong to my Lord in his sweet working. I would even fall sound a sleep in Christs arms, &amp; my sinful head on his holy breast, while he kisseth me; were is not that often the wind turneth to the north, &amp; whiles my sweet Lord Jesus, is, that he will neither give nor take, borrow nor lend with me: I complain he is not social, I half call him proud &amp; lordly of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, &amp; nice of his lookes; which yet is not true. It would content me to give, howbeit he should not take; I should be content to want his kisses at such times, providing he would be content to come near hand &amp; take my wersh, dry &amp; feckless kisses: But at that time he will not be entreated, but lets a poor soul stand still &amp; knock, &amp; never let it on him that he heareth; &amp; then the old leavings &amp; broken meat, &amp; dry sighs, are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er chear then I can tell: all I have then, is, that howbeit the law &amp;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57570:59"/>
wrath have gotten a decret against me, I yet lippen that meekle good in Christ as to get a suspension, &amp; to bring my cause in reasoning again before my welbeloved: I desire but to be heard. And at last he is content to come, &amp; agree the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with a fool, &amp; forgive freely, because he is God. Oh if men would glorify him &amp; taste of Christs sweetness. Brother, ye have need to be busie with Christ, for this whorish-Kirk: I fear Christ cast water upon Scotlands coal; nay I know Christ &amp; his wife will be heard, he will plead for the broken covenant. Arme you against that time. Grace be with you.</p>

               <p>GRace, mercy &amp; peace be to you: I am glad to hear that you have your face home-ward towards your fathers house, now when so many are for a home nearer hand: but your Lord calleth you to another life &amp; glory, then is to be found here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away: &amp; therefore I would counsel you to make sure the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, &amp; rights, which ye have to Salvation. You came to this life about a necessary &amp; weighty business, to tryst with Christ anent your precious soul, &amp; the eternal salvation of it: this is the most necessary business ye have in this life, &amp; your other adoés beside this, are but toyes &amp; feathers, &amp; dreams, &amp; fancies: this is the greatest haste &amp; should be done first. Means are used in the Gospel to draw on a meeting betwixt Christ &amp; you: if ye neglect your part of it, it is, as if you would tear the contract before Christ's eyes, &amp; give up the match, that there shall be no more communing of that business. I know other lovers beside Christ are in suit of you, &amp; your soul wanteth not many wooers, but I pray you make a chaste virgin of your soul, &amp; let it love but one: most worthy
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57570:59"/>
is Christ alone of all your souls love, howbeit your love were higher then the heaven &amp; deeper then the lowest of this earth, &amp; broader then this world: many, alas too many, make a common strumpet of their soul, for every lover that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the house. Marriage with Christ would put your love, &amp; your heart by the gate, out of the way, &amp; out of the eyes of all other unlawfull suiters; &amp; then you had a ready an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for all others, <hi>I am already promised away to Christ, the match is concluded, my soul hath a husband already, &amp; it cannot have two husbands.</hi> Oh if the world did but know what a smel the ointments of Christ cast, and how ravishing his beauty, even the beauty of the fairest of the sons of men is, &amp; how sweet &amp; powerful his voice is, the voice of that one welbeloved! Certainly where Christ cometh, he run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth away with the souls love, so that they cannot command it. I would far rather look but thorow the hole of Christs door, to see but the one half of his fairest, &amp; most comely face [for he looketh like heaven] suppose I should never win in to see his excellency &amp; glory to the full; then to enjoy the flower, the bloome, &amp; chiefest excellency of the glory, &amp; riches, of ten worlds. Lord send me for my part but the meanest share of Christ, that can be given to any of the indwellers of the new Jerusalem; But I know my Lord is no niggard: He can, &amp; it becometh him well to give more, then my narrow soul can receive. If there were ten thousand, thousand millions of worlds, &amp; as many heavens full of men &amp; Angels, Christ would not be pinched to supply all our wants, and to fill us all. Christ is a well of life, but who knoweth how deep it is to the bottom? This soul of ours hath love, and cannot but love some fair one: And O what a fair one, what an onely one, what an excellent lovely ravishing one is Jesus! Put the beauty of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand thousand worlds of Paradises like the garden of Eden in one, put all trees, all flowers, all smels, all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, all tastes, all joyes, all sweetness, all lovelyness is one, O what a fair and excellent thing would that be!
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57570:60"/>
&amp; yet it should be less, to that fair &amp; dearest welbeloved Christ then one drop of rain to the whole seas, rivers, lakes, &amp; four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of ten thousand earths. O but Christ is heavens wonder &amp; earths wonder! what marvel that his bride saith, Cant 5: v. 16. <hi>He is altogether lovely.</hi> Oh that black souls will not come, &amp; fetch all then love to this fair one! O if I could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite &amp; perswade thousands, &amp; ten thousand times ten thousand of Adam's sons; to flock about my Lord Jesus, &amp; to come &amp; take their fill of love! Oh pity, for evermore, that there should be such an one as Christ Jesus, so boundless, so bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomless, &amp; so incomparable in infinite excellency, &amp; sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and so few to take him. Oh, oh, ye poor, dry &amp; dead souls, why will ye not come hither with your toom vessels, &amp; your empty souls, to this huge, &amp; fair, &amp; deep, &amp; sweet well of life, &amp; fill all your toom vessels! Oh that Christ should be so large in sweetness, &amp; worth, &amp; we so narrow, so pinched so ebbe, &amp; so void of all happiness, and yet men will not take him! They lose their love miserably who will not bestow it upon this lovely one. Alas, these five thousand yeers, Adam's fools, his waster-heirs, have been wasting &amp; lavishing out their love, and their affections upon black lovers, and black harlots: upon bits of dead creatures, and broken idols, upon this, &amp; that feckless creature, &amp; have not brought their love, and their heart to Jesus. O pity, that fairness hath so few lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers! O woe, woe to the fools of this world; who run by Christ to other lovers! Oh misery, misery, misery, that comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness can scarce get three, or four hearts in a town, or a countrey! Oh that there is so much spoken &amp; so much written and so much thought of creature-vanity, and so little spoken, so little writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, so little thought of my great, and incomprehensible, and never-enough-wondered-at Lord Jesus. Why should I not curse this forlorn, and wretched world, that suffereth my Lord Jesus to lie his alone? O damned souls, O miskenning world, O blind, O beggerly, and poor souls, O bewitched fools, what aileth you at Christ, that you run so from him? I dare not challenge providence, that there are so few buyers, and so little sale for such an excellent one as Christ. O the depth, and

O the hight of my Lords wayes, that passe finding out. But oh if men would once be wise, and not fall so in love with their own hell, as to pass by Christ, and misken him! But let us come near, and fill our selves with Christ, and let his friends drink, and be drunken, and satisfie our hollow and deep desires, with Jesus. Oh come all and drink at this living well; come drink &amp; live for ever more, come drink &amp; welcome: wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, saith our fairest Bridegroom, no man getteth Christ with ill will, no man cometh &amp; is not welcome, no man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and rueth his voyage: all men speak well of Christ who have been at him; men and Angels who know him, will say more then I dow doe, &amp; think more of him then they can say. O if I were misted and bewildered in my Lords love! Oh if I were fettered &amp; chained to it! O sweet pain to be pained for a sight of him! O living death, O good death! O lovely death to die for love of Jesus! Oh that I should have a sore heart &amp; a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed soul for the wanting of the love of this, &amp; that idol! woe, woe to the mistakings of my miscarrying heart, that gapeth &amp; cryeth for creatures, &amp; is not pained, &amp; cutted, &amp; tortured, &amp; in sorrow for the want of a souls-fill of Christ. Oh that thou would'st come near, my Beloved: O my fairest one, why standest thou a far? come hither that I may be satiat with thy excellent love: O for an union, O for a fellowship with Jesus! O that I could buy with a price that lovely one, suppose hells torments for a while were the price! I cannot beleeve but Christ will ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>GRace, mercy &amp; peace be to you: I long to hear how your soul prospereth. I exhort you to go on in your journey: your day is short, &amp; your afternoon-sun will soon goe down: make an end of your accounts with your Lord: for Death and Judgement are tides, that bide no man: salvation is supposed to be at the door, and Christianity is thought an easie task; but I finde it hard, and the way strait and narrow, were it not but my guide is content to wait on me, and to care for a tired tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller. Hurt not your conscience with any known sin: let your children be as so many flowers, borrowed from God; if the flowers die or wither, thank God for a summers-loan of them, &amp; keep good neighbourhood, to borrow &amp; lend with him. Set your heart upon heaven, and trouble not your spirit with this clay-Idol of the world, which is but vanity, and hath but the lustre of the Rain-bow in the air, which cometh and goeth with a flying March-shower: Clay is the Idol of bastards, not the inheritance of the children. My Lord hath been pleased to make many unknown faces laugh upon me, and hath made me well content of a borrowed fire-side, and a borrowed bed: I am feasted with the joyes of the holy Ghost, &amp; my royal King beareth my charges honourably. I love the smell of Christ's sweet breath, better then the worlds gold. I would I had help

I know also, I have need of a buffeting tempter that grace may be put to exercise &amp; I kept low. Worthy &amp; dear Brother in our Lord Jesus, I write that from my heart which ye now read. 1. I avouch that Christ, &amp; sweating, &amp; sighing under his cross, is sweeter to me by far, then all the Kingdoms in the world could possibly be. 2. If you &amp; my dearest acquaintance in Christ, reap any fruit by my suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; let me be weighed in God's even ballance, if my joy be not fulfilled: What am I to carry the marks of such a great King? But howbeit I am a sink &amp; sinfull mass, a wretched captive of sin, my Lord Jesus can hew heaven out of worse timber then I am (if worse can be.) 3.

rash &amp; passionat oathes, of raging &amp; sudden revenging anger, of night-drinking, of needless companionry, of Sabbath-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of hurting any under you by word or deed, of hating your very enemies.

I know this will not be easily done, but I recommend it to you, as you tender your part of the Kingdom of heaven. Brother, I may from new experience speak of Christ to you: Oh if ye saw in him what I see: a river of God's unseen joyes hath flowed from bank to brae over my soul since I parted with you: I wish I want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed part, so being ye might have, that your soul might be sick of love for Christ, or rather satiat with him: this clay-idol the world, would seem to you then not worth a fig; time will eat you out of possession of it, when the eye strings break &amp; the breath grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth cold &amp; the imprisoned soul looketh out at the windowes of the clay house, ready to leap out into eternity, what would ye then give for a lamp full of oyl?

I hear a man is to be thrust in to that place to the which I have God's right: I know ye should have a voice by God's word in that: Act. 1, 15, 16. to the end, and Act. 6, 3, 5. Ye would be loath that any Prelat should put you out of your possession earthly, &amp; this is your right. What I write to you, I write to your wife. Grace be with you.</p>

But now the crown is fallen from her head, and her gold waxed dim, &amp; our white Nazarites are become black as the coal.

Kings earthly are well-favoured little clay gods and tim's-idol, but a sight of our invisible King shall decry and darken all the glory of this world. At the day of Christ, truth shall be truth, and not treason. Alas it is pitiful, that silence, when the thatch of our Lord's house hath taken fire, is now the flower and the bloom of court and state-wisdom; And to cast a covering over a good profession, (as if it blushed at light,) is thought a canny and sure way through this life: But the safest way I am perswaded, is, to tine &amp; win with Christ, &amp; to hazard fairly for him; for heaven is but a company of Noble venturers for Christ. I dare hazard my soul, Christ shall grow green and blossom as the rose of Sharon yet in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; howbeit now his leaf seemeth to wither and his root to dry up. Your noble Ancestors have been inrolled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the worthies of this nation, as the sure friends of the bridegroom and valiant for Christ: I hope, ye will follow on, to come to the streets for the same Lord; the world is still at <hi>yea</hi> &amp; <hi>nay</hi> with Christ: it shall be your glory &amp; the sure foundation of your house (now when houses are tumbling down, &amp; birds building their nests, &amp; thorns &amp; briers are growing up where Nobles did spread a table) if you engage
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57570:69"/>
your estate &amp; nobility for this noble King Jesus, with whom the created Powers of the world are still in tops: all the world shall fall before him, &amp; (as God liveth) every arm lifted up to take the crown off his royal head, or that refuseth to hold it upon his head, shall be broken from the shoulder-blad: the eyes that behold Christ weep in sackcloth, &amp; wallow in his blood, &amp; will not help, even these eyes shall rot away in their eye-holes, O if ye &amp; the Nobles of this land, saw the beauty of that worlds wonder, Jesus our King, &amp; the glory of him who is Angels wonder &amp; heavens wonder for excellency! Oh what would men count of clay-estates, of time-eaten life, of worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaten &amp; moth-eaten worldly glory, in comparison of that fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, fairest of Gods creation, the son of the father's delights. I have but small experience of suffering for him, but let my Judge &amp; witness in heaven, lay my soul in the ballance of justice, if I finde not a young heaven, &amp; a little Paradise of glorious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, &amp; soul-delighting love-kisses of Christ, here beneath the moon in suffering for him &amp; his truth: &amp; that glory, joy, &amp; peace, &amp; fire of love, I thought had been kept while supper time, when we shall get leisure to feast our fill upon Christ; I have felt it in glorious beginnings, in my bonds, for this prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lord Jesus. Oh it is my sorrow, my daily pain, that men will not come &amp; see: I would now be ashamed to beleeve that it should be possible for any soul to think that he could be a loser for Christ, suppose he should lend Christ the Lordship of Lindsay, or some such great worldly estate. Therefore my <hi>worthy &amp; Dear Lord</hi> set your face against the opposits of Jesus, &amp; let your soul take courage to come under his banner, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare as his souldier for him, &amp; the blessings of a falling Kirk, the prayers of the prisoners of hope who wait for Sions joy, &amp; the good will of him that dwelt in the bush &amp; it burned not, shall be with you.

               <p>GRace, mercy &amp; peace be to you: I am glad to hear that ye in the morning of your short day minde Christ, &amp; that ye love the honour of his crown &amp; Kingdom. I beseech your Lo: begin now to frame your love, &amp; to cast it in no mould but one, that it may be for Christ onely; For when your love is now in the framing, &amp; making, it will take best with Christ: if any other then Jesus get a grip of it, when it is green &amp; young, Christ will be an uncouth &amp; strange world to you. Promise the lodging of your soul first away to Christ, &amp; stand by your first covenant, &amp; keep to Jesus, that he may finde you honest. It is easie to master an arrow, &amp; to set it right ere the string be drawn, but when once it is shot &amp; in the air, &amp; the flight begun, then ye have no power at all to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it: It were a blessed thing, if your love could now levell onely at Christ, that his fair face were the black of the marke ye shot at; For when your love is loosed, and out of your grips, &amp; in its motion to fetch home an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

couple, what a glorious yoke are youth and Grace, Christ &amp; a young-man! This is a meeting not to be found in every town. None who have been at Christ can bring back to your Lo a report answerable to his worth; for Christ cannot be spoken of, or commended according to his worth; <hi>Come &amp; see</hi> is the most faithfull messenger to speak of him, little perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion would prevail where this were: It is impossible in the setting out of Christ's love, to lye, and passe over truth's line: The discourses of Angels, or Love-books written by the congregation of Seraphims [all their wits being conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and melted in one] would for ever be in the nether side of tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

God send me, if it were but the relicts and leavings, or an ounce weight or two, of his matchless love, and suppose I never got a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother heaven [providing this blessed fire were evermore burning] I could not but be happy forever. Come hither then and give out your money wisely for bread: Come here and bestow your love. I have cause to speak this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause except ye enjoy and possess Christ, ye will be a cold friend to his spouse; For it is love to the husband that causeth kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to the wife. I dare swear, it were a blessing to your House, the honour of your Honour, the flower of your credit, now in your place, and as far as ye are able, to lend your hand, to your weeping Mother, even your oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and spoiled Mother-kirk. If ye love her and bestir your self for her, &amp; hazard the Lordship of Boyd for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of her vail [which the smiting-watchmen have taken from her] then surely her husband will scorn to sleep in your common or reverence: Bits of Lordships are little to him who hath many crownes on his head &amp; the Kingdoms of the world in the hollow of his hand. Court, Honour, Glory, riches, Stability of houses, Favour of Princes are all

on his finger ends. O what glory were it to lend your honour to Christ, and to his Jerusalem. Ye are one of Zions born sons, your Honourable and Christian Parents would venture you upon Christ's errands: Therefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you by the mercies of God, by the death and wounds of Jesus, by the hope of your glorious inheritance and by the comfort &amp; hope of the joyfull presence ye would have at the water-side, when ye are putting your foot in the dark grave, take courage for Christ's truth, &amp; the Honour of his free Kingdom; for howbeit ye be a young flower and green before the sun, ye know not how soon death will cause you cast your bloom, and wither root and branch &amp; leaves: And therefore write up what ye have to doe for Christ, and make a treasure of good works, and begin in time: by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance ye have the advantage of the brae: see what ye can doe for Christ against these, who are waiting while Christ's Tabernacle fall, that they may run away with the boards thereof, and build their nests on Zion's ruines: They are blinde who see not lowns now pulling up the stakes and breaking the cords &amp; renting the curtains of Christ's (some times) beautifull tent in this land. Antichrist is lifting that tent up upon his shoulders and going away with it, &amp; when Christ &amp; the Gospel are out of Scotland, dream not that your houses shall thrive, &amp; that it shall goe well with the Nobles of the land; As the Lord liveth the streams of your waters shall become pitch, and the dust of your land brimstone, and your land shall become burning pitch, and the Owl and the Raven shall dwell in your houses, and where your table stood there shall grow briers, &amp; nettles: Isa. 34: 9, 11. The Lord gave Christ and his Gospel as a pawne to Scotland, the watchmen have fallen foul, &amp; lost their part of the pawne; &amp; who seeth not that God hath dryed up their right eye, &amp; their right arme, &amp; hath broken the shepherds staves, &amp; men are treading in their hearts upon such unsavoury salt,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57570:71"/>
that is good for nothing else. If ye the Nobles put away the pawne also, &amp; refuse to plead the controversie of Sion with the professed enemies of Jesus, ye have done with it. Oh where is the courage, &amp; zeal now, of the ancient Nobles of this land, who with their swords &amp; hazard of life, honour &amp; houses brought Christ to our hands? And now the Nobles cannot be but guilty of shouldering out Christ, &amp; murthering of the souls of the posterity, if they shall hide themselves, &amp; lurk in the lee-side of the hill, till the wind blow down the temple of God. It goeth now under the name of wisdom, for men to cast their cloak over Christ &amp; their profession, as if Christ were stolen goods, &amp; durst not be avouched, though this be reputed a pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I would heartily be content to keep a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Kings hall: Oh if I were at the yonder end of my weak desires, then should I be where Christ my Lord, &amp; lover, lives &amp; reigns, there I should be overlastingly solaced with the sight of his face, &amp; satisfied with the surpassing sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his matchless love: But truly now I stand in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side of my desires, &amp; with a drowping head, &amp; panting heart, I look up to fair Jesus standing a far off from us, while corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; death shall scour &amp; refine the body of clay, &amp; rot out the bones of the old man of sin: In the mean time we are blessed in sending word to the beloved, that we love to love him, and till then there is joy in wooing, suiting, lying about his house, looking in at the windows &amp; sending a poor souls groans &amp; wishes thorow a hole of the door to Jesus, till God send a glad meeting: And blessed be God that after a low-ebbe, &amp; so sad a word <hi>Lord Iesus it is long since I saw thee,</hi> That even then, our wings are growing &amp; the absence of sweet Jesus breedeth a new fleece of desires &amp; longings for him: I know no man hath a vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet cross, but the cross is made of that which God will have it. But verily howbeit it be no warrantable market, to buy a cross; yet I dare not say, O that I had liberty to sell Christs cross, lest therewith also I should sell joy, comfort, sense of love, patience &amp; the kind visits of a bridegroom: And therefore bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be God, we get crosses unbought &amp; good cheap.

               <p>GRace, mercy &amp; peace be to you: I dare not say I wonder that ye have never written to me in my bonds, because I am not ignorant of the cause; yet I could not but write to you: I know not whether joy or heaviness in my soul carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it away; sorrow without any mixture of sweetness, hath not often love-thoughts of Christ, but I see the devil can insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuat himself &amp; ride his errands upon the thoughts of a poor op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed prisoner. I am woe that I am making Christ my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend by seeking pleas against him, because I am the first in the Kingdom put to utter silence, &amp; because I cannot preach my Lord's righteousness in the great congregation: I am not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the less solicitous how it goe, if there be not wrath in my cup. But I know, I but claw my wounds when my physician hath forbidden me: I would beleeve in the dark upon luck's head, &amp; take my hazard of Christ's goodwill &amp; rest on this, that in my fever my Physician is at my bed-side, &amp; that he sympathizeth with me when I sigh. My borrowed house, &amp; another man's bed &amp; fire-side &amp; other losses have to room in my sorrow, a greater heat to eat out a less fire, is a good remedie for some burning. I beleeve when Christ draweth blood he hath skill to cut the right veine &amp; that he hath taken the whole ordering and disposing of my sufferings. Let him tutour me, &amp; tutour my crosses as he thinketh good, there is no danger nor hazard in following such a guide; howbeit he should lead me through hell, if I could put faith fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, &amp; fill the fieldwith a quiet on-waiting, &amp; beleeving to see the salvation of God. I know Christ is not obliged to let me see both

the sides of my cross, &amp; turn it over &amp; over, that I may see all, My faith is richer to live upon credit, &amp; Christ's borrowed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, then to have much in my hand. Alas I have forgotten that faith in times past hath stopped a lek in my crazed barke, &amp; hath filled my sailes with a fair wind: I see it a work of God that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences are all lost, when summonds of improbation, to prove our Charters of Christ to be counterfit, are raised against poor souls in their heavie trials: but let me be a sinner, &amp; worse then the chief of sinners, yea a guilty devil, I am sure my welbeloved is God, &amp; when I say Christ is God, &amp; my Christ is God, I have said all things, I can say no more: I would I could build as much on this, <hi>my Christ is God,</hi> as it would bear, I might lay all the world upon it: I am sure Christ untried, and untaken up in the power of his love, Kindness, mercies, goodness, wisdom, long-suffering &amp; greatness, is the rock that dim-sight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed travellers dash their foot against, &amp; so stumble fearfully. But my wounds are sorest, &amp; pain me most, to sin against his love, &amp; his mercy, &amp; if he would set me &amp; my conscience by the ears together &amp; resolve not to rid the plea, but let us deal it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us; my spitting upon the fair face of Christ's love, &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, by my Jealousies, unbelief, and doubting would be enough to sink me. Oh, oh, I am convinced O Lord, I stand dumb before thee for this: Let me be mine own Judge in this, and I take a dreadfull doom upon me for it; for I still misbeleeve, though I have seen that my Lord hath made my cross, as if it were all Crystal, so as I can see thorow it Christs fair face and heaven, and that God hath honoured a lump of sinfull flesh and blood the like of me, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But my Lord in his sweet visits hath done more, for he make me finde that he will be a confined prisoner with me: he lieth down, &amp; riseth up with me, when I sigh, he sigheth: When I weep, he suffereth with me; &amp; I confesse

here is the blessed issue of my sufferings already begun, that my heart is filled with hunger &amp; desire, to have him glorified in my sufferings.

Madam let me charge you in the Lord, as ye will answer to him, help me in this duty [which he hath tyed about my neck with a chain of such singular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of his loving kindness] to set on high Christ, to hold in my honesty at his hands, for I have nothing to give him. O that he would arrest &amp; comprise my love &amp; my heart for all! I am a Dyvour who have no more free goods in the world for Christ, save that, it is both the whole heritage I have &amp; all my movables besides: Lord give the thirsty man a drink. Oh to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ears in the well! Oh to be swattering, &amp; swimming over head &amp; ears in Christ's love! I would not have Christ's love entering in me, but I would enter into it, &amp; be swallowed up of that love. But I see not my self here, for I fear I make more of his love then of himself; whereas himself is far beyond &amp; much better then his love. Oh if I had my sinfull armes filled with that lovely one Christ! Blessed be my rich Lord Jesus who sendeth not away beggers from his house with a toom dish. He filleth the vessels of such as will come &amp; seek: We might beg our selves rich, [if we were wise,] if we could but hold out our withered hands to Christ, &amp; learn to suit, &amp; seek, aske, &amp; knock. I ow my salvation for Christ's glory, low it to Christ, &amp; desire that my hell, yea a new hell, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times hotter then the old hell, might buy praises before men and Angels to my Lord Jesus; providing alwayes I were free of Christ's hatred &amp; displeasure. What am I to be forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed &amp; sold in soul &amp; body, to have my great &amp; royall King set on high, and extolled above all? O if I knew how high to have him set, &amp; all the world far, far beneath the soles of his feet! Nay I deserve not to be the matter of his praises, far less to be an agent in praising of him. But he can win his own glory out of me, &amp; out of one worse then I [if any such be] if it please his holy Majesty so to doe; he knoweth that I am not

Oh if the Nobles had done their part, &amp; been zealous for the Lord it had not been as it is now; but men think it wisdom to stand beside Christ, till his head be broken, &amp; sing dumb. there is a time coming when Christ will have a thick court &amp; he will be the glory of Scotland, &amp; he shall make a diadem, a garland, a seal upon his heart &amp;

a ring on his finger, of these, who have avouched him before this faithlesse generation: Howbeit ere that come, wrath from the Lord is ordained for this land. My Lord, I have cause to write this to your Lo: for I dare not conceal his kindness to the soul of an afflicted, exiled prisoner: Who hath more cause to boast in the Lord then such a sinner as I? Who am feasted with the consolations of Christ, &amp; have no pain in my sufferings, but the pain of soul-sickness of love for Christ, &amp; sorrow that I cannot get help to sound aloud the high praises of him who hath heard the fighing of the prisoner, &amp; is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to lay the head of his oppressed servant in his bosome, under his chinne, &amp; let him feel the smell of his garments.

               <p>GRace, mercy and peace be unto you: Your nor writing to me, cannot binde me up from remembring you now &amp; then, that at least ye may be a witness &amp; a third man, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in paper what is betwixt Christ &amp; me. I was in his eyes like a young Orphan, wanting known parents, casten out in the open fields; either Christ behooved to take me up, &amp; to bring me home to his house and fire-side, else I had dyed in the fields: &amp; now, I am homly with Christ's love, so that I think the house mine own, &amp; the master of the house mine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. Christ enquired not when he began to love me, whether I was fair, or black, &amp; sun-burnt? love taketh what it may have. He loved me before this time I know, but now I have the flower of his love, his love is come to a fair bloom, like a young rose opened up out of the green leaves, &amp; it casteth a strong &amp; fragrant smell. I want nothing but wayes of expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Christ's love: A full vessel would have a vent. O if I could smoke out &amp; cast out coales to make a fire in many brests of this land! Oh it is a pity that there were not many imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Christ, for no other purpose, but to write books &amp; love-songs of the love of Christ. This love would keep all created tongues of men &amp; Angels in exercise, &amp; busie, night &amp; day to speak of it. Alas I can speak nothing of it, but wonder at three things in his love. First, <hi>Freedome.</hi> O that lumps of sin should get such love for nothing. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly. The <hi>Sweetness</hi> of his love, I give over either to speak or write of it, but these that feel it may better bear witness

What it is: but it is so sweet that next to Christ himself nothing can match it: nay I think a soul could live eternally blessed one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on Christ's love, &amp; feed upon no other thing: yea when Christ in love giveth a blow, it doeth a soul good, &amp; it is a kinde of comfort &amp; joy to it, to get a cuff with the lovely, sweet, &amp; soft hand of Jesus. And Thirdly, what power &amp; strength is in his love? I am perswaded it can climb a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Oh when will I see the bridegroom &amp; the bride meet in the clouds &amp; kisse each other! Oh when will we get our day &amp; our hearts full of that love!

It is not for nothing that it is said Colos. 1. 27. <hi>Christ in you the hope of glory.</hi> I will be content of no pawne of heaven but Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; for Christ possessed by faith here is young heaven &amp; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the bud: If I had that pawne I would bide horning &amp; hell both ere I gave it again. All we have here, is scarce the picture of glory: Should not we young bairns long &amp; look

for the expiring of our minority. It were good to be daily begging propines &amp; love-gifts, &amp; the bridegroom's favours, &amp; if we can doe no more seek Crumbs &amp; hungry dinners of Christ's love, to keep the taste of heaven in our mouth while supper time. I know it is far afternoon and nigh the marriage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supper of the Lamb, the table is covered already. O welbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved run, run fast! O fair day when wil't thou dawn! O shaddows flee away! I think hope &amp; love woven thorow other, make our absence from Christ spirituall torment: It is a pain to wait on, but hope that maketh not a hamed swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up that pain. It is not unkindness that keepeth Christ &amp; us so long asunder. What can I say to Christ's love? I think more then I can say: To consider that when my Lord Jesus may take the air [if I may so speak) &amp; goe abroad; yet he will be confined &amp; keep the prison with me: but in all this sweet communion with him what am I to be thanked, for I am but a sufferer, whether I will or not he will be kind to me, as if he had defied my guiltiness to make him unkind, so he beareth in his love on me. Here I die with wondering, that justice hindereth not love; for there are none in hell nor out of hell, more unworthy of Christ's love. Shame may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and scar me, once to hold up my black mouth, to receive one of Christ's undeserved kisses. If my inner-side were turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, &amp; all men saw my vileness, they would say to me, <hi>It is a shame for thee to stand still, while Christ kiss thee &amp; em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace thee:</hi> It would seem to become me rather to run away from hi love, as ashamed at my own unworthiness. Nay I may think shame to take heaven, who have so higly provoked my Lord Jesus: But seeing Christ's love will shame me, I am content to be shamed. My desire is that my Lord would give me broader &amp; deeper thoughts, to feed my self with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering at his love: I would I could weigh it, but I have no ballance for it. When I have worn my tongue to the stump in praising of Christ, I have done nothing to him, I must let him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, for my withered armes will not goe about his high, wide, long and broad love: What remaineth then, but that my debt to the love of Christ lie unpaid for all eternity. All that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57570:77"/>
are in heaven are black sham'd with his love as well as I, we must all be Dyvours together, &amp; the blessing of that house-full, or heaven-full of Dyvours, shall rest for ever upon him. Off this Land &amp; Nation would come &amp; stand beside his inconceivable &amp; glorious perfections, &amp; look in, &amp; love, &amp; wonder, &amp; adore! would to God I could bring in many lovers to Christ's house! But this Nation hath forsaken the fountain of living waters. Lord cast not water on Scotland's coal. Woe, woe will be to this Land, because of the day of the Lord's fierce anger that is so fast coming. Grace be with you.</p>

of religion, that bear bulk in the Kirk, is that wherewith most satisfie themselves: but a watered bed with tears a dry throat with praying, eyes a fountain of tears for the sins of the land is rare to be found among us. Oh if we could know the power of godliness! This is one part of my case, &amp; an other is, that I like a fool once summoned Christ for unkindness, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of his sickelness &amp; unconstaney, because he would have no more of my service nor preaching, &amp; had casten me out of the inheritance of the Lord: And I confess now, this was but a bought plea, &amp; I was a fool, yet he hath born with me: I gave him a fair advantage against me, but love &amp; mercy would not let him take it: &amp; the truth is, now he hath childed himself friends with me, &amp; hath taken away the mask, &amp; hath renewed his wounted favour in such a manner, that he hath paid me my hundred-fold in this life; &amp; one to the hundred. This prison is my banqueting house, I am handled as softly &amp; delicatly as a dâted childe: I am nothing behinde (I see) with Christ, he can in a moneth make up a yeers losses: &amp; I write this to you, that I may entreat, nay, adjure &amp; charge you, by the love of our welbeloved to help me to praise, &amp; to tell all your Christian ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance to help me, for I am as deeply drowned in his debt, as any Dyvour can be: &amp; yet in this fair sun-blenke I have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to keep me from startling, or being exalted above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. His word is a fire shut up in my bowels, &amp; I am weary with forbearing: the ministers in this town are saying they shall have my prison changed into less bounds, because they see God with me: my mother hath born me a man of contention, one that striveth with the whole earth. The late wrongs &amp; oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons done to my brother keep my sails low: yet I defie crosses to embarke me in such a plea against Christ, as I was troubl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with of late: I hope to overhope &amp; overbeleeve my troubles: I have cause now to trust Christ's promise, more then his gloom. Remember my hearty affection to your wife, My soul is grieved for the success of our brethrens journey to New-England, but God hath somewhat to reveal that we see not. Grace be with you. Pray for the prisoner.</p>

               <p>GRace, mercy &amp; peace be unto you: It is more then time that I should have written to you, but it is yet good time, if I could help your soul to mend your pace, &amp; to goe more swiftly to your heavenly countrey; for truly ye have need to make all haste, because the inch of your day that remaineth will quickly slip away, for whether we sleep or wake our glass runneth, the tide bideth no man: Beware of a beguile in the matter of your salvation: woe, woe for evermore to them that lose that prize, for what is behinde when the soul is once lost; but that sinners warme their bits of clay-houses at a fire of their own kindling for a day or two, which doeth rather suffocat with it's smoke then warme them, &amp; at length they lie down in sorrow &amp; are clothed with everlasting shame. I would seek no further measure of faith to begin withall, then to beleeve really, &amp; stedfastly the doctrine of God's Justice, his all-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring wrath &amp; everlasting burning, where sinners are burnt soul &amp; body in a river &amp; great lake of fire &amp; brimstone: Then they would wish no more goods but the thousand part of a cold fountain well to coole their tongue, they would then buy death with enduring of pain &amp; torment for as many yeers, as God hath created drops of rain since the creation: but there is no market in buying or selling life or death there. Oh alas the greatest part of this world run to the place of that torment rejoycing &amp; dancing, eating, drinking &amp; sleeping! my counsel to you is, that ye start in time to be after Christ; for if ye goe quickly, Christ is not far before you: Ye shall overtake him. O Lord God, what is so needfull as this, <hi>salvation, salvation:</hi> Fie upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned &amp; foolish world that will give so little for salvation. Oh, if there were a free market of salvation proclaimed in that day when the trumpet of God shall awake the dead, how many buyers would be then?

Rouze, rouze up therefore your soul, &amp; spier how Christ and your soul met together: I am sure they never got Christ who were not once sick at the yolk of the heart for him: too too many whole souls think they have met with Christ who had never a wearied night for the want of him: But alas, what richer are men that they dreamed the last night they had much gold, &amp; when they awoke in the morning they found it was but a dream? what are all the sinners in the world in that day when heaven &amp; earth shall goe up in a flame of fire, but a number of beguiled dreamers? every one shall say of his hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; his conquest. <hi>Behold it was a dream,</hi> every man in that day will tell his dream.

               <p>GRace, mercy and peace be unto you: I received your letter: I know the savour of Christ in you (that the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins love to follow) cannot be blowen away with winds either from hell, or the evil smelled air of this polluted world: Sir for aback from the walls of this pest-house, even the pollutions of this defiling world. Keep your taste, your love and hope in heaven, it's not good your love &amp; your Lord should be in two sundry countreys. Up, up after your lover, that ye &amp; he may be together. A King from heaven hath sent for you, by faith he sheweth you the new Jerusalem, &amp; taketh you alongst in the Spirit thorow all the ease-rooms, &amp; dwelling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses in heaven, &amp; saith, <hi>All these are thine, this palace is for thee &amp; Christ,</hi> &amp; if ye onely had been the chosen of God, Christ would have built that one house for you and himself: Now, it is for you &amp; many also: take with you in your journey what ye may carry with you, your conscience, faith, hope, patience, meekness, goodness, brotherly kindness; for such wares as these are of great price in the high &amp; new countrey whether ye goe: As for other things, that are but the world's vanity &amp; trash, since they are but the house-sweepings, ye shall doe

best not to carry them with you, ye found them here, leave them here, and let them keep the house. Your Sun is well turned, &amp; low: be nigh your lodging against night. We goe, one &amp; one, out of this great market, till the town be empty, &amp; the two lodgings Heaven &amp; Hell be filled: At length there will be nothing in the earth but room walls &amp; burnt ashes, &amp; therefore it is best to make away. Antichrist &amp; his Master are busie to plenish Hell, &amp; to seduce many; &amp; Stars, great church-lights, are falling from heaven, &amp; many are missed &amp; seduced &amp; make up with their faith, &amp; sell their birth-right, by their hungry hunting for, I know not what: Fasten your grips fast upon Christ, I verily esteem him the best aught that I have: He is my second in prison, having him, though my cross were as heavie as ten mountains of iron, when he putteth his sweet shoulder under me &amp; it, my cross is but a feather. I please my self in the choice of Christ, he is my waile in heaven &amp; earth, I rejoyce that he is in heaven before me, God send a joyfull meeting; &amp; in the mean time the traveller's charges for the way, I mean a burden of Christ's love to sweeten the journey, &amp; to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage a breathless runner, for when I lose breath climbing up the mountain, he maketh new breath.

               <p>GRace, mercy &amp; peace be unto you: I received your letter &amp; renders you thanks for the same; but I have not time to answer all the heads of it as the bearer can inform you. 1. Ye doe well to take your self at the right stot when ye wrong Christ by doubting &amp; misbeleef, for this is to nick-name Christ &amp; terme him a liar, which being spoken to our Prince would be hanging or heading, but Christ hangeth not alwayes for treason: It is good that he may registrat a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers bond a hundred times, &amp; more then seventy times a day have law against us, &amp; yet he spareth us <hi>as a man doeth his son that serveth him:</hi> No tender hearted mother who may have law to kill her sucking childe, would put in execution that law. 2. For your failings even ye have a set tryst with Christ &amp; when ye have a fair seen advantage by keeping your appointment with him, &amp; Salvation cometh to the very passing of the seals: I would say two things. 1. Concluded &amp; sealed Salvation may goe through &amp; be ended, suppose ye write your name to the tail of the Covenant with ink that can hardly be read: Neither think I ever any man's Salvation passed the seals, but there was an odde trick or slip in less or more, upon the fools part, who is infested in heaven: In the most grave &amp; serions work of our Salvation, I think Christ had ever good cause to laugh at our filliness, &amp; to put on us his merits, that we might bear weight. 2. It is a sweet law of the new Covenant, &amp; a priviledge of the new burgh, that the citizens pay according to their means, for the new covenant saith not <hi>so much obedience</hi> by ounce weights, &amp; no less under the pain of damnation: Christ taketh as poor men may give, where there is a mean portion, he is content with the less; if there be sincerity: broken summes &amp; little feckless obedience will be pardoned, &amp; hold the foot with him: know ye not that our kindly Lord retaineth his good old heart yet? He breaketh not a bruised reed nor quencheth the smoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flax: but if the wind blow, he holdeth his hands about, it till it
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57570:81"/>
rise to a flame. The Law cometh on with three <hi>Oyes's, with all the heart: with all the soul, &amp; with all the whole strength:</hi> &amp; where would poor folke like you &amp; me furnish all these summes? it feareth me, (may it is most certain) that if the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were to come out of our purse, when we should put our hand in our bag, we would bring out the wind or worse: But the new Covenant seeketh not heap mete nor stented obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience as the condition of it, because forgiveness hath alwayes place. Hence I draw this conclusion: To think matters betwixt Chirst &amp; us goe back for want of heaped measure, is a piece of old Adam's pride, who would either be at legal pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or nothing: We would still have God in our common &amp; buy his kindness with our merits; for beggerly pride is Devil's<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honest, &amp; blusheth to be in Christ's common, &amp; scarce giveth God a grammercy &amp; a lifted cap [except it be the Pharisee's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky <hi>God</hi> I <hi>

No marvell then of whisperings, whether you be in the Covenant or not? For Pride it maketh loose work of the Covenant of grace, &amp; will not let Christ be full bargain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker. To speak to you particularly &amp; shortly. 1. All the truly regenerated cannot determinatly tell you the measure of their dejections, because Christ beginneth young with many &amp; stealeth into their heart ere they wit of themselves &amp; becometh homely with them with little din, or noise. I grant, many are blinded in rejoycing in a good-cheap conversion, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cost them a sick night; Christ's physick wrought in a dream upon them: But for that, I would say; if other markes be found that Christ is indeed come in, never make a plea with him because he will not answer, <hi>Lord Iesus how camest thou in? whether in at door or window?</hi> Make him welcome since he is come. The wind bloweth where it listeth; all the world's wit cannot perfectly render a reason, why the wind should bea

moneth in the east, six weeks possibly in the west: &amp; the space onely of an afternoon in the south or north: Ye will not finde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>t all the nicks &amp; steps of Christ's way with a foul doe what ye can; for sometimes he will come in stepping softly, like one walking beside a sleeping person &amp; slip to the door, &amp; let none know he was there. 2. Ye object, the truly regenerat should love God for himself: &amp; ye fear that ye love him more for his benefits (as incitements &amp; motives to love him) then for himself. I Answer, to love God for himself as the last end, &amp; also for his benefits as incitements &amp; motives to love him, may stand well together, as a son loveth his mother because she is his mother, howbeit she be poor, &amp; he loveth her for an apple also: I hope ye will not say that benefits are the onely reason &amp; bottom of your love; it seemeth there is a better foundation for it: Alwayes if a hole be in it, sow it up shortly. 3. Ye feel not such mourning in Christ's absence as ye would. I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that the regenerat mourn at all times, &amp; all in alike mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure for his absence, I deny: There are different degrees of mourning less or more, as they have less or more love to him &amp; less or more sense of his absence: But, 1. Some they must have. 2. Sometimes they miss not the Lord, &amp; then they cannot mourn, howbeit it is not long so: At least it is not alwayes so. 3. Ye challenge your self that some truthes finde more credit whith you then others: Ye doe well, for God is true in the least as well as in the greatest, &amp; he must be so to you: Ye must not call him true in the one page of the leaf, &amp; false in the other, for our Lord in all his writtings never contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted himself yet, although the best of the regenerat have slipped here, alwayes labour ye to hold your feet. 4. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the estate of one truly regenerat [whose heart is a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the Holy Ghost] &amp; yours [which is full of uncleanness &amp; corruption] ye stand dumb &amp; discouraged &amp; dare not some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times call Christ heartsomely your own. I Answer, the best regenerat have their defilements &amp; [if I may speak so] their draff-poke that will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>log behinde them all their dayes, &amp; was la as they will, there will be filth in their bosom: But let not this put you from the well. 2. I Answer, albeit there be some
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57570:83"/>
ounce weights of carnality &amp; some squint look, or eye in our neck to an idol, yet love in it's own measure may be sound; for glory must purifie &amp; perfect our love, it will never till then be absolutly pure: yet if the idol reign &amp; have the yolk of the heart &amp; the keyes of the house, &amp; Christ onely be made an underling to run erra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ds, all is not right; therefore examine well. 3. There is a two fold discouragement: one of unbeleef to conclude &amp; make doubting the conclusion for a mote in your eye, &amp; a by-look to an idol, this is ill. There is another discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of sorrow for sin, when ye finde a by-look to an idol: this is good &amp; a matter of thanksgiving, therefore exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine here also. 5. The assurance of Jesus's love ye say would be the most comfortable newes that ever ye heard: <hi>Ans.</hi> That may stop twenty holes, &amp; loose many objections: That love hath tellng in it I trow. Oh that ye knew &amp; felt it as I have done! I wish ye a share of my feast; sweet, sweet hath it been to me: If my Lord had not given me his love, I would have fallen thorow the causey of Aberdeen ere now: But for you, hing on, your feast is not far off, ye shall be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ere ye goe, there is as much in our Lord's pantry as will satisfie all his bairns, &amp; as much wine in his cellar as will quench all their thirst: hunger on, for there is meat in hunger for Christ: Goe never from him, but fash him [who yet is pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the importunity of hungry souls] with a dish-full of hungry desires till he fill it; &amp; if he delay, yet come not ye away, albeit ye should fall a swoon at his feet. 7. Ye crave my minde, whether found comfort may be found in prayer, when conviction of a known idol is present. I answer, an idol as an idol can not stand with found comfort; for that comfort that is gotten at Dagon's sect is a cheat or blea-flumme: yet sound comfort &amp; conviction of an eye to an idol, may as well dwell together, as tears &amp; joy: But let this doe you no ill, I speak it for your encouragement, that ye may make the best out of your joyes ye can, albeit ye finde them mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with motes. 2. Sole conviction, if alone without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse and grief, is not enough, therefore lend it a tear if ye dow win at it. 7. Ye question, when ye win to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57570:83"/>
more fervency sometimes with your neighbour in prayer then your alone, whether hypocrisie be in it, or not? I answer, if this be alwayes, no question a spice of hypocrisie in in it, which would be taken head to; out possibly desertion may be in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat, &amp; presence in publike, &amp; then the case is clear. 2. A fit of applause may occasion by accident a rubbing of a cold heart &amp; so heat &amp; life may come, but it is not the proper cause of that heat: hence God of his free grace will ride his errands upon our stinking corruption, but corruption is but a meer occasion &amp; accident; as the playing on a pipe removed anger from the prophet &amp; made him fitter to prophesie: 2. King. 3: v. 15. 8. Ye complain of Christ's short visits, that he will not bear you company one night, but when ye lie down warm at night, ye rise cold at morning. <hi>Ans.</hi> I cannot blame you [nor any other who knoweth that sweet guest] to bemoan his withdrawings, &amp; to be most desirous of his abode &amp; company; for he would captivat &amp; engage the affection of any creature that saw his face: since he looked on me &amp; gave me a sight of his fair love, he gained my heart wholly, &amp; got away with it: Well, well may he brook it, he shall keep it long ere I fetch it from him. But I shall tell you what ye shall doe: treat him well, give him the chair &amp; the board-head, &amp; make him welcome to the mean portion ye have; a good supper &amp; kind entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment maketh the guest love the innes the better: Yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Christ hath an errand elsewhere, for meer trial, &amp; then though ye give him king's-chear he will away; as is clear in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions for meer trial, &amp; not for sin. 9. Ye seek the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the motions of the Spirit in their least measure, &amp; the natural joyes of your own heart. <hi>Ans.</hi> as a man can tell if he joy &amp; delight in his wife, as his wife, or if he delight &amp; joy in her for satisfaction of his lust, but hating her person, &amp; so loving her for her her flesh &amp; not grieving when ill befalleth her: so will a man's joy in God, and his who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ish naturall joy be discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if he sorrow for any thing that may offend that Lord, it will speak the singleness of his love to him. 10. Ye aske the reason why sense overcometh faith <hi>Ans.</hi> because sense is more naturall, &amp; neer of kin to our own selfish &amp; soft nature. Ye
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57570:84"/>
aske, if faith in that ease be found? Ans: If it be chased away, it is neither sound nor unsound, because it is not faith; but it might be &amp; was faith before sense did blow out the act of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving. Lastly, ye aske what to doe when promises are born in upon you, &amp; sense of impenitency for sins of youth, hindereth application. I answer; if it be living sense, it may stand with application, &amp; in this case, put to your hand &amp; eat your meat in God's name: if false, so that the sins of youth are not repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, then as faith &amp; impenitency cannot stand together, so neither that sense &amp; application can consist. <hi>Brother,</hi> excuse my brevity, for time straitneth me, that I get not my minde said in these things, but must refer that to a new occasion, if God offer it. <hi>Brother,</hi> Pray for me.

of a letter to a prisoner from you ere now. I am here, Sir, putting off a part of my inch of time, &amp; when I awake first in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing [which is alwayes with great heaviness &amp; sadness] this question is brought to my minde, Am I serving God or not? Not that I doubt of the truth of this honourable cause wherein I am engaged, [I dare venture in to eternity &amp; before my judge that I now suffer for the truth: because that I cannot endure that my Master who is a free-born King, should pay tribute to any of the shields or pot-sheards of the earth: Oh that I could hold the crown upon my Princely King's head with my sinfull arm, howbeit it should be stroke from me in that service from the shoulder blade] but my closed mouth, my dumb Sabbaths, the memory of my communion with Christ, in many fair, fair dayes in <hi>Anwoth</hi> [whereas now my master gotteth no service of my tongue as then] hath almost broken my faith in two halves; yet in my deepest apprehensions of his anger, I see thorow a cloud that I am wrong, &amp; he in love to my soul hath taken up the controversie betwixt faith &amp; apprehensions, and a decret is past on Christ's side of it, &amp; I subscribe the decret: The Lord is equal in his wayes, but my guiltiness often overmastereth my beleeving, I have not been well known, for except as to open out-breakings I want nothing of what Judas &amp; Cain had; onely he hath been pleased to prevent me in mercy &amp; to cast me into a fever of love for himself, &amp; his absence maketh my fever most painfull, &amp; beside, he hath visited my soul &amp; water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it with his comforts, but yet I have not what I would, the want of reall and felt possession is my onely death, I know Christ pitieth me in this.

upon my harlot-mother this Apostat-kirk, the time is coming when we shall wish for doves wings to flee and hide us, Oh for the desolation of this land. 3. I see my dear master Christ go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his alone [as it were] mourning in sackeloth, his fainting friends fear that King Jesus shall lose the field, but he must carry the day. 4. My guiltiness and the sins of my youth are come up against me, and they would come in the plea in my sufferings, as deserving causes in God's justice; but I pray God for Christ's sake he never give them that room, woe's me that I cannot get my Royall, dreadfull, mighty &amp; glorious Prince of the Kings of the earth set on high. Sir, ye may help me &amp; pity me in this, and bow your knee &amp; blesse his name, &amp; desire others to doe it, that he hath been pleased in my sufferings to make Atheists, Papists, &amp; ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies about me, say, <hi>It is like God is with this prisoner.</hi> Let hell &amp; the powers of hell [I care not] be let loose against me to doe their worst, so being Christ &amp; my Father, &amp; his Father be magnified in my sufferings. 6. Christ's love hath pained me, for howbeit his presence hath shamed me and drowned me in debt, yet he often goeth away when my love to him is burning, he seemeth to look like a proud wooer who will not look upon a poor match who is dying of love, I will not say he is lordly, but I know he is wise in hiding himself from a childe &amp; a fool, who maketh an idol &amp; a God of one of Christ's kisses, which is Idolatry: I fear I adore his comforts more then himself, and that I love the apples of life better then the tree of life.

Thirdly, but truly when Christ's sweet wind is in the right airth, I repent, &amp; I pray Christ to take law-borrows of my quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, &amp; unbeleeving sadness &amp; sorrow [Lord rebuke them that put ill betwixt a poor servant like me, &amp; his good master] then I say whether the black cross will or not, I must climb, hands &amp; feet up to my Lord. I am now ruing from my heart, that I pleasure the law [my old dead husband] so far as to apprehend wrath in my sweet Lord Jesus, I had far rather take an hire to plead for the grace of God, for I think my self Christ's sworn debter, &amp; the truth is to speak of my Lord what I cannot deny, I am over head &amp; ears drowned in many obligations to his love &amp; mercy, he handleth me sometimes so, that I am ashamed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most to seek more for a four-hours, but to live content till the marriage-supper of the Lamb with that which he giveth; but I know not how greedy &amp; how ill to please love is, for either my Lord Jesus hath taught me ill manners, not to be content of a seat except my head lie in his bosom, &amp; except I be fed with the fattest of his house, or else I am grown impatiently dainty &amp; ill to please, as if Christ were obliged under this cross to doe no other thing but bear me in his armes, &amp; as if I had claim by

O what sweet peace have I, when I finde Christ holdeth &amp; I draw, when I climb up &amp; he shutteth me down, when I grip him &amp; embrace him, &amp; he seemeth to loose the grips &amp; flee away from me: I think there even is a sweet joy of faith &amp; contentedness &amp; peace in his very tempting unkindness, because my faith saith, Christ is not in sad earnest with me, but trying if I can be kinde to his mask &amp; cloud that covereth him, aswell as to his fair face: I bless his great name that I love his vail that goeth over his face while God send better: for faith can kiss Gods tempting reproaches, when he nicknameth a sinner, <hi>a dog, not worthy to eat bread with the bairns,</hi> I think it an honour that Christ miscalleth me &amp; reproacheth me: I will take that well of him, howbeit I would not bear it well if another would be that homely; but because I am his own [God be thanked] he may use me as he pleaseth: I must say, the saints have a sweet life betwixt them &amp; Christ, there is much sweet solace of love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him &amp; them, when he feedeth among the lilies &amp; cometh in to his garden &amp; maketh a feast of honey combs, &amp; drinketh his wine &amp; his milk, &amp; cryeth, <hi>Eat O friends, drink, be ye drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en O welbeloved.</hi> One hour of this labour, is worth a ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of world's drunken &amp; muddy joy: nay even the gate of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is the sunny side the of brae &amp; the very garden of the world; for the men of this world have their own unchristned &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane crosses &amp; woe be to them &amp; their cursed crosses both; for their ills are salted with Gods vengeance, &amp; our ills seasoned with our fathers blessing: So they are no fools who choose Christ &amp; sell all things for him; it is no bairns market nor a blinde block, we know well what we get &amp; what we give.

               <p>GRace, mercy &amp; peace be unto you: I am sorry that what joy &amp; sorrow drew from my imprisoned pen in my love-fits, hath made you &amp; many of God's children beleeve, that there is something in a broken reed the like of me, except that Christ's grace hath bought such a sold body, I know not what else any may think of me, or expect from me: my stock is less [my Lord knoweth I speak truth] then many beleeve: my empty sounds have promised too much: I would be glad to lie under Christ's feet, &amp; keep &amp; receive the off-fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings or the old pieces of any grace that fall from his sweet fingers to forlorn sinners: I lie often uncouth-like, looking in at the King's windowes: surely I am unworthy of a seat in the King's hall-floor: I but often look afar off, both feared and framed-like to that fairest face, fearing he bid me look away from him: my guiltiness riseth up upon me &amp; I have no answer for it: I offered my tongue to Christ &amp; my pains in his house, &amp; what know I what it meaneth when Christ will not receive my poor propine: when love will not take, we expone, it will

neither take nor give, borrow nor lend. Yet Christ hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother sea-compass he saileth by, then my short &amp; raw thoughts: I leave his part of it to himself. I dare not expound his dealing as sorrow &amp; misbelief often dictateth to me: I look often with bleared and blinde eyes to my Lords cross, &amp; when I look to the wrong-side of his cross, I know I miss a step &amp; slide: sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I see I have not legs of my own for carrying me to heaven, I must goe in at heavens gates borrowing strength from Christ. I am often thinking, Oh if he would but give me leave to love him, &amp; if Christ would but open up his wares, &amp; the infinite, infinite plyes &amp; windings &amp; corners of his soul-delighting-love, &amp; let me see it back-side &amp; fore-side, &amp; give me leave but to stand beside it, like an hungry man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side meat, to get my fill of wondering as a preface to my fill of enjoying: but verily I think my foul eyes would defile his fair love to look to it: Either my hunger is over humble [if that may be said] or else I consider not what honour it is to get leave to love Christ. O that he would pity a prisoner, &amp; let out a flood upon the dry ground! it is nothing to him to fill the like of me, one of his looks would doe me meekle world's good &amp; him no ill. I know I am not at a point yet with Christ's love, I am not yet fitted for so much as I would have of it; my hope sitteth neighbour with meekle black hunger, &amp; certainly I dow not but think, there is more of that love or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for me, then I yet comprehend, &amp; I know not the weight of the pension the King will give me; I shall be glad, if my hungry bill get leave to lie beside Christ waiting on an ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer: now I would be full &amp; rejoyce, if I got a poor man's almes of that sweetest love: but I confidently beleeve there is a bal made for Christ &amp; me, &amp; that we shall take our fill of love in it: &amp; I often think, when my joy is run out &amp; at the lowest ebbe, that I would seek no more but my rights past the King's great seal, &amp; that these eyes of mine could see Christ's hand at the pen. If your Lord call you to suffering, be not dismayed; there shall be a new allowance of the King for you when ye come to it: One of the softest pillowes Christ hath, is laid under his witnesses head, though often they must set down their bare feet among

               <p>GRace, mercy &amp; peace be to you: I am glad that ye goe on at Christ's back in this dark &amp; cloudy time: It were good to sell other things for him; for when all these dayes are over, we shall finde it our advantage, that we have taken part with Christ. I confidently beleeve his enemies shall be his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stool, &amp; that he shall make green flowers dead withered hay, when the honour &amp; glory shall fall off them, like the bloom or flower of a green herb shaken with the wind. It were not wisdom for us to think that Christ &amp; the Gospel will come &amp; sit down at our fire side, nay, but we must goe out of our warm houses &amp; seek Christ &amp; his gospel: It is not the sunny side of Christ that we must look to, &amp; we must not forsake him for want of that, but must set our face against what may befall us in following on till he &amp; we be through the briers &amp; bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

O how sweet a thing were it for us, to learn to make our burdens light, by framing our hearts to the burthen and making our Lord's will a law! I finde Christ &amp; his cross not so ill to please, nor yet such troublesom guests as men call them: Nay, I think patience should make Christ's water good wine;

I am in as sweet communion with Christ as a poor sinner can be, &amp; am onely pained that he hath much beauty and fairness, and I little love, he great power &amp; mercy &amp; I little faith, he much light &amp; I bliered eyes.

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57570:93"/>
hath been going about you these many years by afflictions, to engage you to himself, it were a pity &amp; a loss to say him nay. Verily I could wish, that I could swim through hell &amp; all the ill weather in the world &amp; Christ in my arms; but it is my evil &amp; folly, that except Christ come unsent for, I dow not goe to seek, him: When he &amp; I fall in reckoning, we are both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, he in payment, &amp; I in counting, &amp; so marches lie still unrid &amp; counts uncleared betwixt us. O that he would take his own blood for counts &amp; miscounts, that I might be a free man, &amp; none had any claim to me, but onely, onely Jesus. I will think it no bondage to be rooped, comprised &amp; posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by Christ, as his bond-man. Think well of the visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of your Lord: For I finde one thing I saw not well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that when the saints are under trials &amp; well humbled, little sins raise great cryes &amp; war-shouts in the conscience; &amp; in prosperity conscience is a Pope to give dispensations, &amp; let out &amp; in, &amp; give latitude, &amp; elbow-room to our heart. O how little care we for pardon at Christ's hand, when we make dispensations! And all is but bairns-play, till a cross without, beget an heavier cross within, &amp; then we play no longer with our Idols: It is good still to be severe against ourselves, for we but transform God's mercy into an Idol, &amp; an Idol that hath a dispensation to give for turning of the grace of God into wantonness. Happy are they who take up God, wrath, jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice &amp; sin, as they are in themselves: For we have miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying light that parteth with childe, when we have good reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions: But God be thanked that Salvation is not rolled upon our wheels. O but Christ hath a saving eye! Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in his eye-lids: When he first looked on me, I was saved; It cost him but a look to make hell quite of me: O merits, free merits, &amp; the dear blood of God, was the best gate that ever we could have gotten of hell! O what a sweet, O what a safe &amp; sure way is it, to come out of hell leaning on a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour! That Christ &amp; a sinner should be one &amp; have heaven betwixt them &amp; be halvers of Salvation, is the wonder of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: What more humble could love be? &amp; what an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent smell doeth Christ cast on his lower garden, where there
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57570:93"/>
grow but wilde flowers, if we speak by way of comparison; but there is nothing but perfect garden flowers in heaven, &amp; the best plenishing that is there, is Christ: We are all obliged to love heaven for Christ's sake, he graceth heaven &amp; all his father's house with his presence: He is a rose that beautifieth all the upper garden of God; a leaf of that rose of God, for smell, is worth a world: O that he would blow his smell upon a withered &amp; dead soul, let us then goe on to meet with him &amp; to be filled with the sweetness of his love: Nothing will hold him from us; he hath decreed to put time, sin, hell, devils, men &amp; death out of the way, &amp; to rid the rough way betwixt us &amp; him, that we may enjoy one another. It's strange &amp; wonderfull that he would think long in heaven without us, &amp; that he would have the company of sinners to solace &amp; delight himself withall in heaven. &amp; now the supper is abiding us: Christ the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom with desire is waiting on till the bride, the Lamb's wife, be busked for the marriage, &amp; the great hall be rid for the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that joyfull couple. O fools, what doe we here? &amp; why sit we still? Why sleep we in the prison? Were it not best to make us wings to flee up to our blessed match, our mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row &amp; our fellow-friend? I think, <hi>Misterss,</hi> ye are looking there-away, &amp; this is your second or third thought: make forward, your guide waiteth on you.

I thought also of a sleeping Devil that would pass by the like of me, lying in moores &amp; out-fields: So I bigged the gook's nest, &amp; dreamed of dying at ease &amp; living in a fools paradise; but since I came hither I am often so, as that they would have much Rhetorick that would perswade me, that Christ hath not written wrath on my dumb &amp; silent Sabbaths [which is a persecution of the latest edition, being used against none in this land, that I can learn of besides me] &amp; often I lie under a non-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, &amp; would gladly sell all my joyes to be confirmed King Jesus's free tennent, &amp; to have sealed assurances; but I see often blank papers: &amp; my greatest desires are these two. 1. That Christ would take me in hand to cure me, &amp; undertake for a sick man, I know I should not die under his hand: &amp; yet in this, while I still doubt, I beleeve through a cloud, that sorrow which hath no eyes; hath but put a vail on Christ's love. 2.

him often since I came hither, to come with some short blenks of his sweet love, &amp; then because I have none to help me to praise his love, &amp; can doe him no service in my own person, [as I thought once I did in his temple] then I die with wishes &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, to take up house &amp; dwell at the well-side &amp; to have him praised &amp; set on high: But alas, what can the like of me doe to get a good name raised upon my welbeloved Lord Jesus, suppose I could desire to be suspended for ever of my part of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for his glory? I am sure, If I could get my will of Christ's love, &amp; could be once over head &amp; ears in the beleeved, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, &amp; seen love of the Son of God, it were the fulfilling of the desires of the onely happiness I would be at; but the truth is, I hinder my communion with him, because of want of both faith &amp; repentance, &amp; because I will make an idol of Christ's kisses: I will neither lead nor drive, except I see Christ's love run in my channel &amp; when I wait and look for him the upper way, I see his wisdom is pleased to play me a slip &amp; come the lower way; so that I have not the right art of guiding Christ: for there is art &amp; wisdom required in guiding of Christ's love aright, when we have gotten it.

Oh alas, I have cause to be grieved, that men expect any thing of such a wretched man as I am: It is a wonder to me, if Christ can make any thing of my naughtie, short &amp; narrow love to him; surely it is not worth the up-taking. 2. As for our lovely and beloved Church in Ireland, my heart bleedeth for her deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; but I beleeve our Lord is onely lopping the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees, but not intending to cut them down or root them out. It is true, seeing we are heart-Atheists by nature, &amp; can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take providence aright, [because we halt &amp; crook ever since we fell] we dream of an halting providence, as if God's yard whereby he measureth joy &amp; sorrow to the sons of men, were crooked &amp; unjust, because servants are on horse-back &amp; Princes goe on foot; but our Lord dealeth good &amp; evil &amp; some one por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or other to both, by ounce-weights; &amp; measureth them in a just and even ballance. It is but folly to measure the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel by summer or winter-weather: The summer-sun of the saints, shineth not on them in this life: how should we have complained if the Lord had turned the same providence, that we now stomacke at, up-side down, &amp; had ordered matters thus, that first the saints should have enjoyed heaven, glory, &amp; ease, &amp; then Methusalem's dayes of sorrow &amp; daily miseries; we should think a short heaven no heaven: certainly his wayes pass finding out. 3. Ye complain of the evil of heart-atheism, but it is to a greater atheist then any man can be, that ye write to of that: Oh, light findeth not that reverence &amp; fear as a plant of God's setting should finde in our soul! How doe we by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as others, detain &amp; captivat the truth of God in unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, &amp; so make God's light a bound prisoner, &amp; even when the prisoner breaketh the jayle &amp; cometh out in belief of a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, &amp; in some practice of holy obedience; how often doe we of new, lay h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THe constant &amp; daily observing of God's going alongst with you, in his coming, going, ebbing, flowing, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing &amp; kissing, glooming &amp; striking giveth me [a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less &amp; lazie observer of the Lord's way &amp; working] an heavie stroke: could I keep sight of him, &amp; know when I want, &amp; carry as became me in that condition, I would blesse my case. But. 1. For desertions, I think them like lying-lay of lean &amp; weak land, for some yeers, while it gather sap for a better crope: It is possible to gather gold where it may be had with moon light. Oh if I could but creep one foot, or half a foot neerer in to Jesus in such a dismal night as that, when he is away: I should think it an happy absence. 2. If I knew the beloved were onely gone away for triall, &amp; for further humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, &amp; not smoked out of the house with new provocations, I would forgive desertions, &amp; hold my peace at his absence, but Christ's bought absence [that I bought with my sin] is two running boils at once, one upon either side, &amp; what side then can I lie on? 3. I know as night &amp; shaddows are good for
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57570:96"/>
flowers, &amp; moonlight, &amp; dews are better then a continuall sun; so is Christ's absence of speciall use, &amp; it hath some nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vertue in it, &amp; giveth sap to humility, &amp; putteth an edge on hunger, &amp; furnisheth a fair field to faith to put forth it self, &amp; to exercise it's fingers in gripping, it seeth not what. 4. It is mercy's wonder, &amp; grace's wonder, that Christ will lend a piece of the lodging, &amp; a back-chamber be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side himself to our lusts, &amp; that he &amp; such swine should keep house together in our soul: For suppose they couch &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract themselves into little room, when Christ cometh in, &amp; seem to lie as dead under his feet; yet they often break out again: And that a foot of the old man, or a leg or arm nailed to Christ's cross looseth the naile or breaketh out again; &amp; yet Christ beside this unruly &amp; misnurtured neighbour can still be making heaven in the saints one way or other, may not I say, <hi>Lord Iesus, what doest thou here?</hi> Yet here he must be; but I will but lose my feet to goe on into this depth &amp; won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for free mercy &amp; infinite merits took a lodging to Christ &amp; us beside such a loath some guest as sin. 5. Sanctification &amp; mortification of our lusts, are the hardest part of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: It is in a manner as naturall to us to leap when we see the new Jerusalem, as to laugh when we are tickled, joy is not under command, or at our nod when Christ kisseth: but O how many of us would have Christ divided in two halves, that we might take the half of him onely &amp; take his office <hi>Iesus</hi> &amp; <hi>salvation,</hi> but <hi>Lord</hi> is a cumbersome word, &amp; to <hi>obey</hi> &amp; <hi>work out our own salvation</hi> &amp; <hi>to perfect holyness,</hi> is the cumbersome &amp; stormy north-side of Christ, &amp; that we eshew &amp; shift. 6. For your question, the accesse that reprobats have to Christ [which is none at all, for to the Father in Christ neither can they, nor will they come, because Christ dyed not for them; &amp; yet by law, God &amp; justice overtaketh them] I say, First, there are with you more worthy &amp; learned then I am <hi>Mrs Dickson, Blair, &amp; Hamilton</hi> who can more fully satisfie you; but I shall speak in brief what I think of it in these assertions. 1. All God's jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice toward man &amp; Angels floweth from an act of the absolut soveraign free-will of God, who is our former &amp; potter, &amp;
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57570:97"/>
we are but clay; for if he had forbidden to eat of the rest of the trees of the Garden of Eden, &amp; commanded Adam to eat of the tree of knowledge of good &amp; evil, that command no doubt had been as just as this, <hi>Eat of all the trees, but not at all of the tree of knowledge of good &amp; evil:</hi> The reason is, because his will is before his justice by order of nature, &amp; what is his will, is his justice, &amp; he willeth not things without himself because they are just: God cannot, God needeth not to hunt sanctity, holyness or righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness from things without himself, &amp; so not from the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men or Angels; because his will is essentially holy and just, &amp; the prime rule of holyness &amp; justice: as the fire is naturally light, and inclineth upward &amp; the earth heavie, &amp; inclineth downward. The 2 assertion then is, that God saith to reprobats beleeve in Christ [who hath not dyed for your salvation] &amp; ye shall be saved, is just &amp; right, because his eternall &amp; essentially just will, hath so enacted &amp; decreed: Suppose naturall reason speak against this, this is the deep &amp; speciall mystery of the Gospel. God hath obliged hard and fast all the reprobats in the visible Church to beleeve his promise, <hi>he that beleeveth shall be saved,</hi> &amp; yet in God's decree and secret intention, there is no salvation at all decreed and intended to reprobats; and yet the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of God being from his Soveraign free-will, is most just, as said is in the first assertion. 3. Assertion: The righteous Lord hath right over the reprobats &amp; all reasonable creatures that violat his commandements, this is easie. 4. As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion: the faith that God seeketh of reprobats, is, That they rely upon Christ as despairing of their own righteousness, lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly, &amp; withall humbly, as weary &amp; leaden, upon Christ, as on the resting stone laid in Sion; but he seeketh not that without being weary of their sin they rely on Christ, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind's Saviour; for to rely on Christ &amp; not to weary of sin, is presumption, not faith: faith is ever neighbour to a contrite spirit, &amp; it's impossible that faith can be where there is not a casten down &amp; contrite heart in some measure for sin: Now it is certain God commandeth no man to presume. 5. Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: then Reprobats are not absolutly obliged to beleeve, that Christ dyed for them in particular; for in truth neither repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57570:97"/>
nor others are obliged to beleeve a lye, onely they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to beleeve, Christ dyed for them, if they be first weary, burdened, sin-sick &amp; condemned in their own consciences, &amp; striken dead &amp; killed with the law's sentence, &amp; have indeed embraced him as offered, which is a second &amp; subsequent act of faith, following after a coming to him, &amp; closing with him. 6. Assertion: Reprobatsare not formally guilty of comtempt of God, &amp; misbelief because they apply not Christ and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of the Gospel to themselves in particular, for so they should be guilty because they beleeve not a lye, which God never oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to beleeve. 7. Assertion: justice hath a right to punish reprobats, because out of pride of heart, confiding in their own righteousness, they rely not upon Christ, as a Saviour of all them that come to him: This, God may justly oblige them unto; Because in Adam they had perfect ability to doe, and men are guilty because they love their own inability &amp; rest u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon themselves, &amp; refuse to deny their own righteousness, &amp; to take them to Christ, in whom there is righteousness for wearied sinners. 8. Assertion: It is one thing to rely, lean, &amp; rest upon Christ in humility &amp; weariness of spirit, &amp; denying our own righteousness beleeving him to be the onely righteousness of wearied sinners, &amp; it is another thing to beleeve Christ dyed for me, <hi>Iohn, Thomas, Anna,</hi> upon an intention &amp; decree to save us by name. For 1. the first goeth first, the latter is alway after in due order 2. The first is faith, the second is a fruit of faith. 3. The first obligeth reprobats &amp; all men in the visible Kirk, the latter obligeth onely the weary &amp; leaden, &amp; so onely the elect &amp; effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually called of God. 9. Assertion: It is a vain order, <hi>I know not if Christ dyed for me, Iohn, Thomas, Anna by name; &amp; therefore I dare not rely on him?</hi> The reason is, because It is not faith, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve God's intention &amp; decree of election at the first, ere ye be wearied: look first to your own intention &amp; soul, if ye finde sin a burden, and can, and doe rest, under that burden upon Christ; if this be once, now come &amp; beleeve in particular or rather apply by sense [for in my judgement it is a fruit of belief, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief] &amp; feeling the goodwill, intention, and gracious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of God anent your salvation: Hence because there is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57570:98"/>
in reprobats and contempt of Christ, guilty they are; and justice hath law against them: And which is the mystery, they cannot come up to Christ because he dyed not for them; but their sin is, that they love this their inability to come to Christ, and he who loveth his chains, deserveth chains: And thus in short remember my bonds.</p>

It is little your Lo: hath to give him, he will not sleep long in your common, but shall surely pay home your losses for his cause. It is but our bliered eyes that look thorow a false glass to this idol-god of clay &amp; think some thing of it: They who are past with their last sentence to heaven or hell, and have made their reckoning &amp; departed out of this smoky inne, have now no other conceit of this world, but as a piece of beguiling, wel-lustred clay: &amp; how fast doeth time [like a flood still in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion] carry your Lo: out of it? &amp; is not eternity coming with wings?

I hope ye know what conditions past betwixt Christ &amp; you at your first meeting: Ye remember he said, your summer dayes would have clouds and your rose a prickly thorn bende it: Christ is unmixt in heaven, all sweetness and honey, here we have him with his thorny and rough cross; yet I know no tree beareth sweeter fruit then Christ's cross, except I would raise a lving report on it: It is your part to take Christ as he is to be had in this life: Sufferings are like a wood planted round about his house, over door and window: If we could hold fast our grips of him; the field were won: Yet a little while and Christ shall triumph: Give Christ his own short time to spin, out these two long threeds of heaven and hell to all mankind, for certainly the threed will not break; and when he hath accomplished his work in mount Zion and hath refined his silver, he will bring new ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels out of the furnace, and plenish his house and take up house again. I counsel you to free your self of clogging temptations, by overcoming some, &amp; contemning others; and watching over all: abide true and loyal to Christ, for few now are fast to him: they give Christ blank paper for a bond of service and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, now when Christ hath most adoe: to waste a little blood with Christ, and to put out part of this drossie world in pawne over in his hand, as willing to quite it for him, is the safest ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet to keep the world in: But these who would take the world &amp; all their flitring on their back &amp; run away from Christ, they will fall by the way &amp; leave their burden behinde them, &amp; be taken captive themselves. Well were my soul to put all I have; life &amp; soul, over in Christ's hands; let him be forth-coming for all. If any ask, how I doe?

I see, nothing, no money, no worth no good, no life, no deserving is the ground that omnipotency delighteth to draw glory out of.

O that the middle things betwixt us were removed!

I finde it a difficult matter to keep all stots with Christ: when he laugheth I scarce beleeve it, I would so fain have it true. But I am like a low man looking up to a high mountain, whom weariness and fainting overcometh. I would climb up, but I finde that I doe not advance in my journey as I would wish: Yet I trust he shall take me home against night. I marvel not that Antichrist in his slaves is so busie, but our crowned King seeth and beholdeth, and will arise for Zion's safety. I am exceedingly distracted with letters and company that vilite me; what I can doe, or time will permit, I shall not omit: Excuse my brevity, for I am straitned.

The Lord reigneth, &amp; hath a saving eye upon you &amp; your ministery, &amp; therefore fear not what men can doe. I bless the Lord that the Irish ministers finde employment, &amp; the professors comfort of their ministery: Beleeve me, I durst not, as I am now disposed, hold an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest brother out of the pulpit: I trust, the Lord shall guard you &amp; hide you in the shadow of his hand: I am not pleased with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that are against you in that. I see this, in prosperity mens conscience will not start at small sins: But if some had been where I have been since I came from you, a little more would have caused their eye water &amp; troubled their peace.

               <p>I Am refreshed with your letters: I would take all well at my Lord's hands that he hath done, If I knew I could doe my Lord any service in my suffering: suppose my Lord would make a stop-hole of me to fill a hole in the wall of his house, or a pinning in Zion's new work: For any place of trust in my Lord's house, as steward or chamberlain, or the like: surely I think my self <hi>[my very dear brother,</hi> I speak not by any proud figure or trope] unworthy of it; nay I am not worthy to stand behinde the door: if my head &amp; feet &amp; body were half out, half in, in Christ's house, so I saw the fair face of the Lord of the house, it would still my grieuing &amp; love-sick desires. When I hear that the men of God are at work &amp; speaking in our Lord Jesus his name, I think my self but an out-cast or out-law chased from the City to lie on the hills &amp; live amongst the rocks &amp; out-fields. O that I might but stand in Christ's out-house, or hold a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in any low vault of his house! But I know this is but the vapours that arise out of a quarrellous &amp; unbeleeving heart, to darken the wisdom of God. And your fault is just mine, that I cannot beleeve my Lord's bare &amp; naked word: I must either have an apple to play me with &amp; shake hands with
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57570:109"/>
Christ, &amp; have seal, caution, &amp; witness to his word, or else I count my self loose; how beit I have the word &amp; faith of a King. Oh, I am made of unbelief &amp; cannot swim but where my feet may touch the ground! Alas, Christ under my temptations is presented to me as lying-waters, as a dyvour &amp; a cousener! We can make such a Christ as temptations [cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us in a night-dream] doeth feign &amp; devise [&amp; tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations represent Christ ever unlike himself] &amp; we in our folly listen to the tempter. If I could minister one saving word to any, how glad would my soul be: But I my self [which is my greatest evil] often mistake the cross of Christ: For I know if we had wit &amp; knew well that ease slayeth us fools, we would desire a market where we might barter or niffer our lazie ease with a profitable cross; howbeit there be an out-cast natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al betwixt our desires &amp; tribulation: But some give a dear price &amp; gold for physick which they love not &amp; buy sickness, howbeit they wish rather to have been whole then to be sick. But surely. <hi>Brother,</hi> ye shall not have my advice [howbeit alas I cannot follow it my self] to contend with the honest &amp; faithfull Lord of the house; for goe he or come he, he is ay gracious in his departure: There are grace &amp; mercy &amp; lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kindness upon Christ's back-parts: &amp; When he goeth away, the proportion of his face, the image of that fair sun that staveth in eyes, senses &amp; heart after he is gone, leaveth a mass of love behinde it in the heart. The sound of his knock at the door of his beloved after he is gone &amp; past, leaveth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And as for Christ's cross I never received evil of it, but what was of mine own making: when I miscooked Christ's physick, no marvel that it hurt me: For since it was on Christ's back it hath alwayes a sweet smell &amp; these 1600 Years it keepeth the smell of Christ; nay it is elder then that too, for it is a long time since <hi>Abel</hi> first hansel'd the cross &amp; had it laid upon his shoulders &amp; down from him all alongst to this very day all the saints have

known what it is. I am glad that Christ hath such a relation to this <hi>cross,</hi> &amp; that it is called <hi>the cross of our Lord Iesus, Gal.</hi> 6: v. 14. <hi>His reproaches, Heb.</hi> 13: 13. As if Christ would claim it as his proper goods, &amp; so it cometh in the reckoning among Christ's own property: If it were simple evil, as sin is, Christ, who is not the author nor owner of sin, would not own it. I wonder at the enemies of Christ [in whom malice hath run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with wit, &amp; will is up &amp; wit down] that they would essay to lift up the stone laid in <hi>Zion:</hi> surely it is not laid in such sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ground as that they can raise it or remove it; for when we are in their belly &amp; they have swallowed us down, they will be sick &amp; spue us out again. I know <hi>Zion</hi> &amp; her Husband can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not both sleep at once: I beleeve our Lord once again shall water with his dew the withered hill of mount <hi>Zion</hi> in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> &amp; come down &amp; make a new marriage again, as he did long since. Remember our <hi>Covenant:</hi> Your excuse for your advice to me is needless: Alas, many sit beside light as sick folks beside meat &amp; cannot make use of it. Grace be with you.</p>

more gentle mettall: It is easy for God, to make a fool of the Devil the father of all fools. As for me, I but breath out what my Lord breatheth in: The scum &amp; froth of my letters, I father upon my own unbeleeving heart. I know your Lord hath something to doe with you, because Satan &amp; malice have shot sore at you; but your bowe abideth in it's strength. Ye shall not by my advice be a halver with Christ, to divide the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of your deliverance betwixt your self &amp; him; or any other second mean whatsoever: Let Christ [as it setteth him well] have all the glory, &amp; triumph his alone. The Lord set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self on high in you: I see Christ can borrow a cross for some hours, &amp; set his servants beside it, rather then under it, &amp; win the plea too, yea &amp; make glory to himself &amp; shame to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies &amp; comfort to his children out of it: But whether Christ buy or borrow crosses, he is King of crosses, &amp; King of Devils, &amp; King over hell, &amp; King over malice: When he was in the grave, he came out, &amp; brought the keys with him: he is Lord-Jaylor, nay what say I, he is Captain of the castle, &amp; he hath the keys of deaths hell; &amp; what are our troubles but little deaths: &amp; he who commandeth the great castle commandeth the little also. 2. I see, a hardned face &amp; two skins upon our browes, against the winter hail, &amp; stormy wind, is meetest for a poor traveller in a winter journey to heaven. O what art is it to learn to endure hardness &amp; to learn to goe bare footed either through the devil's fiery coals or his frozen waters! 3. I am perswaded a sea-venture with Christ maketh great riches: Is not our King Jesus his ship coming home, &amp; shall not we get part of the gold? Alas, we fools miscount our gain when we seem losers. Beleeve me, I have no challenges against this well-born cross, for it is come of Christ's house &amp; is honourable &amp; his propine, <hi>To you it is given to suffer.</hi> O what fools are we to undervalue his gifts, &amp; to lightlie that which is true honour! For if we could be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, our tackling shall not loose, nor our mast break, nor our sails blow into the sea. The bastard crosses, the kinless &amp; base-born crosses of worldlings for evil doing, must be heavie &amp; grievous; but our afflictions are light &amp; momentany. 4. I think my self happy that I have lost credit with Christ, &amp; that
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57570:112"/>
in this bargain I am Christ's sworn dyvour, to whom he will lippen nothing, no not one pin in the work of my salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Let me stand in black and white in the Dyvour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book be ore Christ, I am happy that my salvation is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credited to Christ's mediation: Christ oweth no faith to me, to lippen any thing to me; but O what faith &amp; credit I ow to him! Let my name fall &amp; let Christ's name stand in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour with man &amp; angel. Alas, I have no room to spread out my affection before God's people, &amp; I see not how I can shout out &amp; cry out the loveliness, the high honour &amp; the glory of my fairest Lord Jesus. Oh that he would let me have a bed to lie in, to be delivered of my birth, that I might paint him out in his beauty to men as I dow. 5. I wondered once at providence &amp; called white providence black &amp; unjust, that I should be smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in a town where no soul will take Christ off my hand: But providence hath another lustre with God, then with my bliered eyes. I proclaim my self a blinde body who know not black &amp; white in the uncouth course of God's providence. Suppose Christ would set hell where heaven is &amp; devils up in glory beside the elect Angels [which yet cannot be] I would I had a heart to acquiesce in his way without further dispute. I see, infinite wisdom is the mother of his judgements &amp; his wayes pass finding out. 6. I cannot learn, but I desire to learn to bring my thoughts, will, &amp; lusts, in under Christ's feet, that he may trample upon them: But alas, I am still upon Christ's wrong side.

If this whole world were the balk of a ballance, it should not be able to bear the weight of Christ's love; man &amp; angels have short arms to fathom it: Set your feet upon this piece blew &amp; base clay of an over-guilded &amp; fair plaistered world; an hours kissing of Christ is worth a world of worlds. <hi>Sir,</hi> make sure work or your salvation, build not upon sand, lay the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation upon the rock in <hi>Zion:</hi> strive to be dead to this world &amp; to your will &amp; lusts: Let Christ have a commanding power &amp; a King throne in you: Walk with Christ, howbeit the wind should take the hide off your face: I promise you Christ will win the field: Your pastors cause you to erre; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you see Christ's word, goe not one foot with them: Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance not the reading of that Romish Service-book: Keep your garments clean, as ye would walk with the Lamb clothed in white. The wrongs I suffer are upon record in heaven: our great Master &amp; Judge will be upon us all, &amp; bring us before the sun in our black's &amp; white's: Blessed are they who watch &amp; keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in God's love. Learn to discern the Bridegroom's tongue, &amp; to give your self to prayer &amp; reading. Ye was often a hearer of me: I would put my heart blood upon the doctrine I taught, as the onely way to salvation: goe not from it, <hi>my dear Brother.</hi> What I write to your self, I write to your wife also. Minde heaven &amp; Christ, &amp; keep the spunk of the love of Christ you have gotten; Christ shall blow on it, if ye entertain it, &amp; your end shall be peace. There is a fire in our <hi>Zion;</hi> but our Lord is but seeking a new Bride refined &amp; purified out of the furnace. I assure you, howbeit we be nick-named <hi>Puritans,</hi> all the powers of the world shall not prevail against us: Remember, though a sinfull man write it to you, these people shall yet be in <hi>Scotland</hi> as a green olive-tree &amp; a field blessed of the Lord, &amp; it shall be proclaimed, <hi>up, up with Christ, &amp; down, down with all contrary powers.

But my Lord Jesus had a good eye that the tempter should not play foul play, &amp; blow out Christ's candle; he took no thought of my stomacke, &amp; fretting &amp; grudging humour, but of his own grace: when he burnt the house he saved his own goods: And I beleeve, the devil &amp; the persecuting world shall reap no fruit of me, but burnt ashes: for he will see to his own gold, &amp; save that from being consumed with the fire. O what ow I to the file, to the hammer, to the furnace of my Lord Jesus! Who hath now let me see how good the wheat of Christ is, that goeth through his mill &amp; his oven, to be made bread for his own table: <hi>Grace tried</hi> is better then grace, &amp; it is more then grace, it is glory in it's infancy. I now see, godliness is more then the out-side &amp; this world's passements &amp; their buskings: Who knoweth the truth of grace without a trial? O how little getteth Christ of us, but that which he winneth, [to speak so] with much toil &amp; pains! And how soon would faith frieze without a cross! How many dumb crosses have been laid upon my back, that had never a tongue to speak the sweetness of Christ, as this hath? when Christ blesseth his own crosses with a tongue, they breath out Christ's love, wisdom, kindness &amp; care of us. Why should I start at the plough of my Lord, that maketh deep fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows on my soul? I know he is no idle husbandman, he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth a crop. O that this white withered lay-ground were made fertile to bear a crop for him, by whom it is so painfully dressed, &amp; that this fallow ground were broken up! Why was I [a fool] grieved that he put his garland &amp; his rose upon my head, the glory &amp; honour of his faithfull witnesses? I desire now to make no moe pleas with Christ: Verily he hath not put me to a loss by what I suffer, he oweth me nothing; for in my bonds, how sweet &amp; comfortable have the thoughts of him been to me: where in I finde a sufficient recompence of reward! How blinde are my adversaries who sent me to a banquetting house, to a house of wine, to my lovely Lord Jesus his love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feasts, &amp; not to a prison or place of exile?

Yet I am not ashamed of my Lord Jesus his garland &amp; crown: I would not exchange my weeping with the fourteen Prelat, painted laughter. At my first coming here, I took the <hi>Dorts</hi> at Christ &amp; would forsooth summond him for unkindness; I sought a plea of my Lord &amp; was tossed with challenges, whether he loved me or not? &amp; disputed all over again that he had done to me; because his word was a fire shut up in my bowels &amp; I was weary with forbearing; because I said I was cast out of the Lord's inheritance: but now I see I was a fool: My Lord miskend all &amp; did bear with my foolish jealousies &amp; miskend that ever I wronged his love, and now he is come again with mercy under his wings: I past from my [O witless] summonds: he is God [I see] &amp; I am man. Now it hath pleased him to renew his love to my soul, &amp; to dâte his poor prisoner. Therefore, <hi>my dear Brother,</hi> help me to praise, &amp; shew the Lord's people with you, what he hath done to my soul, that they may pray &amp; praise: &amp; I charge you, in the name of Christ, not to omit it; for, for this cause I write to you that my suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings may glorifie my royal King &amp; edifie his church in <hi>Ireland.</hi> He knoweth how one of Christ's love-coals hath burnt my soul with a desire to have my bonds to preach his glory, whose cross I now bear. God forgive you if ye doe it not; But I hope the Lord will move your heart to proclaim in my behall, the sweetness, excellency &amp; glory of my royal King. It is but our soft flesh that hath raised a slander on the cross of Christ; I see now the white side of it: My Lord's chains are all over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guilded.

               <p>GRace mercy &amp; peace be unto you: I am yet waiting what our Lord will doe for his afflicted church, &amp; for my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entry to my Lord's house. Oh that I could hear the forfeiture of Christ [now casten out of his inheritance] recalled &amp; taken off by open proclamation, &amp; that Christ were restored to be a Free holder and a landed Hieritour in Scotland: &amp; That the courts fenced in the name of the bastard Prelats [their God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father's the Pop's Bailiffes &amp; Sherifes] were cryed down! Oh how sweet a sight were it to see all the Tribes of the Lord in this land fetching home again our banished king Christ to his own palace, his Sanctuary and his throne! I shall think it mercy to my soul, if my faith shall out-watch all this winter night &amp; not nod or slumber, till my Lord's summer day dawn upon me. It is much if faith &amp; hope in the sad nights of our heavie trial escape with a whole skin, &amp; without crack or crook: I confess unbelief hath not <hi>reason</hi> to be either <hi>father</hi> or <hi>mother</hi> to it: [for unbelief is alwayes an irrationall thing] but how can it be, but such weak eyes as ours must cast water in a great smoke; or that a weak head should not turn giddy when the water runneth deep and strong? But God be thanked that Christ in his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren can endure a stress &amp; storm: howbeit soft nature would fall down in peices. Oh that I had that confidence as to rest
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57570:118"/>
rest on this, though he should grind me into small powder, &amp; bray me into dust, &amp; scatter the dust to the four winds of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; that my Lord would gather up the powder &amp; make me up a new vessel again to bear Christ's name to the world: I am sure that love bottomed &amp; seated upon the faith of his love to me would desire &amp; endure this, &amp; would even claim &amp; thriep kindness upon Christ's strokes, &amp; kiss his lovely glooms: &amp; both spell &amp; read salvation upon the wounds made by Christ's sweet hands. Oh that I had but a promise from the mouth of Christ, of his love to me; &amp; then howbeit my faith were as ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as paper I think longing &amp; dwining &amp; griening of sick desires would cause it bide out the siege, till the Lord came to fill the soul with his love: &amp; I know also in that case faith should abide green &amp; sappy at the root, even at mid winter, and stand out against all stormes: However it be I know Christ winneth heaven in dispite of hell; But I ow as many praises &amp; thanks to free grace as would lie betwixt me &amp; the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most border of the highest heaven, suppose ten thousand hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens were all laid above other: But oh I have nothing that can hire or bud grace, for if grace would take hire it were no more grace; but all our stability, &amp; the strength of our salvation is anchored &amp; fastened upon free grace: and I am sure Christ hath by his death &amp; blood casten the knot so fast that the fingers of devils &amp; hel-fuls of sins cannot loose it; &amp; that bond of Christ [that never yet was nor never shall nor can be registrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed] standeth surer then heaven or the dayes of heaven, as that sweet pillar of the covenant, whereupon we all hang: Christ and all his little ones under his two wings, &amp; in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe or circle of his arms, is so sure, that cast him and them in the ground of the sea, he shall come up again &amp; not loose one: An odde one cannot, nor shall not be lost in the telling. This was alwayes God's aime since Christ came in the play be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him &amp; us, to make men dependent creatures, and in the work of our salvation to put created strength, &amp; arms, &amp; legs of clay, quit out of play, &amp; out of office &amp; court: &amp; now God hath substituted in our room &amp; accepted his Son the mediator
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:57570:118"/>
for us &amp; all that we can make. If this had not been I would have skinked over &amp; foregone my part of paradise &amp; salvation, for a break-fast of dead moth-eaten earth; but now I would not give it, nor let it go for more then I can tell: &amp; truly they are silly fools, and ignorant of Christ's worth [&amp; so full ill trained and tutoured] who tell heaven &amp; Christ over the board, for two feathers or two straws of the devil's painted plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, onely lustred in the utter side. This is our happiness now, that our reckonings at night when eternity shall come upon us, cannot be told; we shall be so far gainers &amp; so far from being su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per expended [as the poor fools of this world are, who give out their money &amp; get in but black hunger] that Angels cannot lay our counts nor summe our advantage &amp; in-comes. Who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how far is it to the bottom of our Christ, &amp; to the ground of our heaven? Who ever weighed Christ in a pair of bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances? Who hath seen the foldings, &amp; plyes, and the heights and depths of that glory which is in him and kept for us? Oh for such a heaven as to stand afar off and see &amp; love and long for him; while time's threed be cut, and this great work of creation dissolved at the coming of our Lord! Now to his Grace I recommend you. I beseech you also pray for a re-entry to me into the Lord's house, if it be his good will:</p>

               <p>GRace mercy and peace be unto you: I have long had a purpose of writing to you, but I have been hindred: I heartily desire that ye would minde your journey; &amp; consider to what airth your soul setteth it's face; for all come not home at night, who suppose they have set their face heaven-ward:
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:57570:119"/>
it is a woefull thing to die &amp; misse heaven, &amp; to lose house-room with Christ at night: It is an evil journey where travellers are benighted in the fields. I perswade my self that thousands shall be deceived &amp; ashamed of their hope: because they cast their anchor in sinking sands they must lose it. Till now I knew not the pain, labour, nor difficulty that there is to win home; nor did I understand so well before this, what that meaneth: <hi>The righteous shall scarcely be saved.</hi> Oh how many a poor Professor's candle is blowen out &amp; never lighted again! I see ordinary profession, &amp; to be ranked amongst the children of God, &amp; to have a name among men, is now thought good enough to carry professors to heaven; but certainly a name is but a name, &amp; will never bide a blast of God's storm: I counsell you not to give your soul or Christ rest, nor your eyes sleep, till ye have gotten something that will bide the fire &amp; stand out the storm. I am sure if my one foot were in heaven &amp; then he would say, <hi>fend thy self, I will hold my grips of thee no longer:</hi> I should goe no further; but presently fall down in as many Pieces of dead nature. They are happy for evermore who are over head &amp; ears in the love of Christ, &amp; know no sickness but love-sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for Christ: &amp; feel no pain but the pain of an absent &amp; hidden welbeloved. We run our souls out of breath &amp; tire them in coursing &amp; galloping after our own night-dreams [such are the rovings of our miscarrying hearts] to get some created good thing in this life &amp; on this side of death: We would fain slay &amp; spin out a heaven to our solves in this side of the water; but sorrow, want, changes, crosses &amp; sin are both woof &amp; warp in that ill-spun web. O how sweet &amp; dear are these thoughts that are still upon the things which are above! &amp; how happy are they who are longing to have little sand in their glass &amp; to have time's threed cut &amp; can cry to Christ, <hi>Lord Iesus have over, come &amp; fetch the driry passenger!</hi> I wish our thoughts were more frequently then they are on our countrey. O but heaven casteth a sweet smell afar off, to these who have spirituall smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling! God hath made many fair flowers, but the fairest of them all is heaven, &amp; the flower of all flowers is Christ. O why doe we not flee up to that lovely one? Alas that there is such
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:57570:119"/>
scarcity of love, &amp; lovers of Christ amongst us all. Fy, fy upon us who love fair things, as fair gold, fair houses, fair lands, fair pleasures, fair honours &amp; fair persons; and doe not pine &amp; melt away with love for Christ. O would to God I had more love for his sake. O for as much love as would lie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt me &amp; heaven for his sake. O for as much love as would goe round about the earth &amp; over the heaven, yea the heaven of heavens &amp; ten thousand worlds, that I might let all out upon fair, fair, onely fair Christ! But alas I have nothing for him; yet he hath much for me: it is no gain to Christ that he getteth my little feckless span-length &amp; hand-breadth of love. If men would have something to doe with their hearts &amp; their thoughts that are alwayes rolling up &amp; down, like men with oares in a boat after sinfull vainities, they may finde great &amp; sweet employment to their thoughts upon Christ: If these frothie fluctuaring &amp; restless hearts of ours, would come all about Christ &amp; look in to his love, to bottomless love, to the depth of mercy, to the unsearchable riches of his grace, to enquire after &amp; search into the beauty of God in Christ; they would be swallowed up in the depth, &amp; height, length, &amp; breadth of his goodness. Oh if men would draw the curtains &amp; look in to the inner side of the arke, &amp; behold how the fulness of the Godhead dwelleth in him bodily! O who would not say let me die, let me die ten times to see a sight of him! ten thousand deaths were no great price to give for him. I am sure, sick fainting love would high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the market &amp; raise the price to the double for him: But alas if men &amp; Angels were rouped &amp; sold at the dearest price, they would not all buy a night's love or a four &amp; twentie hours sight of Christ! O how happy are they who get Christ for nothing! God send me no more for my part of Paradise, but Christ: and surely I were rich enough &amp; as well hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven'd as the best of them, if Christ were my heaven. I can write no better thing to you, then to desire you, if ever ye laid Christ in a count; to take him up &amp; count over again; and weigh him again and again: And after this have no other to court your love, and to wooe your soul's, delight but Christ: he will be found worthy of all your love;
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:57570:120"/>

It must be your resolution to set your face against Satan's northern tempests &amp; stormes for salvation: Nature would have heaven come sleeping to us in our beds: we would all buy Christ, sobeing we might make price our selves; but Christ is worth more blood &amp; lives then either ye or I have to give him. When we shall come home &amp; enter to the possession of our brother's fair kingdom, &amp; when our heads shall finde the weight of the eternall crown of glory, &amp; when we shall look back to pains &amp; sufferings; then shall we see life, &amp; sorrow, to be less then one step or stride from a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to glory: &amp; that our little inch of time-suffering is not worthy of our first night's welcome-home to heaven.

I have been these two Sabbaths or three in privat, taking instruments in the name of God, that my Lord Jesus &amp; I have kissed each other in Aberden, the house of my pilgrimage: I seek not an apple to play me with he knoweth, whom I serve in the spirit but a seal; I but beg earnest, &amp; am content to suspend &amp; frist glory while supper time: I know this world will not last with me; for my moon-light is noon-day light, &amp; my <hi>four-hours</hi> above my feasts when I was a preacher; at which times also, I was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced very often in his armes: But who can blame Christ to take me on behinde him [if I may say so] on his white horse or in his chariot paved with love through a water: Will not a father take his little <hi>dated Davie</hi> in his armes, &amp; carry him over a ditch or a mire? my short legs could not step over this laire or sinking mire &amp; therefore my L: Jesus will bear me thorow: If a change

come &amp; a dark day, so being that he will keep my faith without flaw or crack, I dare not blame him; howbeit I get no more while I come to heaven: But ye know the physick behooved to have sugar, my faith was fallen a swoon, and Christ but held up a swooning man's head: Indeed I pray not for a Dâted Bairn's diet, he knoweth I would have Christ sowre or sweet; any way. sobeing it be Christ indeed: I stand not now upon paired apples or sugared dishes; but I cannot blame him to give, &amp; I must gape and make a wide mouth: since Christ will not pantry-up joyes, he must be welcome who will not bide away: I seek no other fruit but that he may be glorified: he knoweth, I would take hard fare to have his name set on high. I bless you for your counsel: I hope to live by faith and swim without a masse or bundle of joyfull sense under my chinne; at lest to venture albeit I should be ducked. Now for my case I think the Councel should be essayed, and the event referred to God: Duties are ours and events are God's.

               <p>GRace, mercy &amp; peace be to you: I received your long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked-for &amp; short letter; I would ye had spoken more to me who stand in need: I finde Christ as ve write ay the longer the better, &amp; therefore cannot but rejoyce in his salvation, who hath made my chains my wings, &amp; hath made me a King over my crosses &amp; over my adversaries: glory, glory, glory to his high, high &amp; holy name: Not one ounce, not one grain-weight more is laid on me, then he hath enabled me to bear: And I am not so much wearied to suffer as Sion's haters are to persecute. Oh if I could finde a way in any measure to strive to be even with Christ's love, but that I must give over! Oh who would help a dyvour to pay praises to the King of saints, who triumpheth in his weak servants? I see if Christ but ride upon a worm, or a feather, his horse will neither stumble nor fall: The worm Jacob is made by him a new sharp threshing instrument hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing teeth to thresh the mountains, &amp; beat them small, &amp; to make the hills as chaff &amp; to fan them, so as the wind shall carry them away, &amp; the whirlwind shall scatter them. Isa. 41: 14, 15, 16. Christ's enemies are but breaking their own heads in pieces upon the rock laid in Zion, &amp; the stone is not removed out of it's place: Faith hath cause, to take courage from our very afflictions, the devil is but a whet-stone to sharpen the faith &amp; patience of the saints: I know he but heweth &amp; polisheth stones all this time for the new Jerusalem: But in all this, three things have much moved me, since it hath pleased my Lord to turn my moon light into day-light. First, he hath yoked me to work, to wrestle with Christ's love of longing, wherewith I am sick, pained, fainting &amp; like to die, because I cannot get himself, which I think a strange sort of desertion; for I have
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57570:122"/>
not himself [whom if I had my love-sickness would coole &amp; my fever goe away, at least I should know the heat of the fire of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placencie, which would coole the scorching heat of the fire of desire] &amp; yet I have no penurie of his love, &amp; so I dwin, I die, &amp; he seemeth not to rue on me. I take instruments in his hand that I would have him; but I cannot get him, &amp; my best chear is black hunger: I blesse him for that feast. Secondly, old challenges now &amp; then revive &amp; cast all down, I goe halting &amp; sighing, fearing there be an unseen processe yet coming out, &amp; that heavier then I can answer: I cannot read distinctly my Surtie's act of cautionrie for me in particular, &amp; my discharge; &amp; sense rather then faith assureth me of what I have: So unable am I to goe but by an hold. I could [with reverence of my Lord] forgive Christ, if he would give me as much faith as I have hunger for him: I hope the pardon is now obtained, but the peace is not so sure to me as I would wish: Yet, one thing I know; there is not a way to heaven but the way he hath graced me to professe &amp; suffer for. Thirdly, woe, woe is me for the virgin daughter of <hi>Scotland</hi> and for the fearfull desolation &amp; wrath appointed for this land; And yet all are sleeping, eating and drinking, laughing and sporting, as if all were well. Oh our dim gold, our dumb, blinde pastors, the sun is gone down upon them, and our Nobles bid Christ send for himself if he be Christ: It were good we should learn in time the way to our strong hold. Sir howbeit not acquainted remember my love to your wife, I pray God establish you.</p>

I blesse his high &amp; glorious name that the terrors of great men, have not affrighted me from open avouching of the Son of God; nay his cross is the sweetest burden that ever I bare: It is such a burden as wings are to a bird, or sailes to a ship to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry me forward to my harbour. I have not much cause to fall in love with the world; but rather to wish that he who sitteth upon the floods would bring my broken ship to Land, &amp; keep my conscience safe in these dangerous times: for wrath from the Lord is coming on this sinfull Land. It were good that we prisoners of hope knew of our strong hold to run to, before the storm come on: Therefore Sir I beseech you by the mercies of God and comforts of his Spirit, by the blood of your Saviour, &amp; by your compearance before the sin-revenging Judge of the world, keep your garments clean &amp; stand for the truth of Christ, which ye professe: When the time shall come that your eye strings shall break, your face wax pale, your breath grow cold, &amp; this house of clay shall totter, &amp; your one foot shall be over the march in eternity, it shall be your comfort &amp; joy that ye gave your name to Christ. The greatest part of the world think heaven at the next door, &amp; that Christianity is an easie task; but they will be beguiled. Worthy Sir, I beseech you make sure work of salvation: I have found by experience that all I could doe, hath had much adoe in the day of my trial; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lay up a sure foundation for the time to come.

This is the fruit of my sufferings that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire Christ's name may be spread abroad in this Kingdom in my behalf. I hope in God not to slander him again; yet in all this I get not my feasts without some mixture of gall; neither am I free of old jealousies, for he hath removed my lovers &amp; friends far from me, he hath made my congregation desolate &amp; taken away my crown: &amp; my dumb sabbaths are like a stone tied to a bird's foot that wanteth not wings, they seem to hinder me to fleo: Were it not that I dare not say one word, but, <hi>Well done, Lord Iesus.</hi> We can in our prosperity sport our selves &amp; be too bold with Christ, yea be that insolent as to chide with him; but under the water we dare not speak.

I pray God I never finde my <hi>will</hi> again: Oh if Christ would subject my <hi>will</hi> to his &amp; trample it under his feet, &amp; liberate me from that lawless Lord.

I his banished prisoner? If the comparison could stand, I would not exchange Christ with heaven it self: He hath left a dart &amp; arrow of love in my soul, &amp; it paineth me till he come &amp; take it out: I finde pain of these wounds because I would have posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. I know now this worm-eaten apple, the plaistered rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten world, that the silly Children of this world are beating &amp; buffetting &amp; pulling others ears for; is a portion for bastards good enough: &amp; that is all they have to look for. I offend not that my adversaries stay at home at their own fire-side with more yearly rent then I; should I be angry that the good-man of this house of the world casteth a dog a bone to hurt his teeth? he hath taught me to be content with a borrowed fire-side &amp; an uncouth bed: &amp; I think I have lost nothing, the in come is so great. O what telling is in Christ! O how weighty is my fair garland, my crown, my fair supping-hall in glory, where I shall be above the blowes and buffettings of Prelats! Let this be your desire &amp; let your thoughts dwell much upon that blessednesse that abideth you in the other world: The fair side of the world will be turned to you quickly, when ye shall see the crown: I hope ye are neer your lodging: O but I would think my self blessed for my part to win the house before the shower come on! For God hath a quiver full of arrowes to shoot at &amp; shower down upon <hi>Scotland.</hi> Ye have the prayers of a prisoner of Christ. I desire <hi>Patrick</hi> to give Christ his young love even the flower of it, and put it by all others it were good to start soon to the way: He should thereby have a great advantage in the evil day.

ye take it as a mark of a lawfully begotten childe &amp; not of a bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard to be under your father's rod: till ye be in heaven it will be but foul weather, one shower up &amp; another down: The lintel-stones &amp; pillars of the new Jerusalem suffer moe knocks of God's hammer &amp; tool, then the common side-wall stones: &amp; if twenty crosses be written for you in God's book, they will come to ninteen &amp; then at last to one, &amp; after that nothing but your head betwixt Christ's breasts for evermore: &amp; his own soft hand to dry your face &amp; wipe away your teares. As for publike suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for his truth, your Master also will see to these: Let us put him in his own office, to comfort &amp; deliver: the gloom of Christ's crosse is worse then it self. I cannot keep up what he hath done to my soul: My <hi>dear Brother,</hi> will I not get help of you to praise &amp; to lift Christ up on high? He hath pained me with his love, &amp; hath left a love arrow in my heart that hath made a wound &amp; swelled me up with desires, so, that I am to be pitied for want of reall possession: love would have the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the party loved: &amp; my greatest pain is the want of him, not of his joyes &amp; comforts, but of a neer union, &amp; commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. This is his truth I am fully perswaded I now suffer for: For Christ hath taken upon him to be witnesse to it, by his sweet comforts to my soul; &amp; shall I think him a false witnesse, or that he would subscribe blank paper? I thank his high and dreadfull name, for what he hath given, I hope to keep his seal &amp; his pawne till he come &amp; loose it himself. I defie hell to put me off it, but he is Christ &amp; he hath met with his prisoner: &amp; I took instruments in his own hand, that it was he &amp; no other for him. When the Devil fenceth a bastard court in my Lord's ground &amp; giveth me forged summonds, it will be my shame to misbeleeve after such a fair broad seal: &amp; yet Satan &amp; my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension sometimes make a lye of Christ, as if he hated me; but I dare beleeve no evil of Christ: if he would cool my love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fever for himself with reall presence &amp; possession, I would be rich; but I dare not be mislearned and seek more in that kinde; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it be no shame to beg at Christ's door.

Let the good-man of the house cast a dog a bone why should I offend? I rejoyce that the broken bark shall come to land, &amp; that Christ will on the shore welcome the sea-sick passenger.

It is the Lord's kindness that he will take the scum off us in the fire: Who knoweth how needfull winnowing is to us, &amp; what dross we must want ere we enter into the Kingdom of God? So narrow is the entry to heaven that our knots, our bunches &amp; lumps of pride, and self-love, &amp; idol-love, &amp; world-love must be hammered off us, that we may throng in, stooping low &amp; creeping thorow that narrow &amp; thorny entry. And now for my self, I finde it the most sweet &amp; heavenly life, to take up house &amp; dwelling at Christ's fire-side, &amp; set down my tent upon Christ that founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-stone, who is sure &amp; faithfull ground &amp; hard under foot. Oh if I could win to it &amp; proclaim my self not the world's debt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, nor a lover obliged to it; &amp; that I minde not to hire or bud this world's love any longer; but defie the kindness &amp; feud of God's whole creation whatsomever; especially the lower vault &amp; clay part of God's creatures, this vain earth: For what hold I of his world? A borrowed lodging &amp; some years house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room, &amp; bread &amp; water, &amp; fire &amp; bed &amp; candle, &amp;c. are all a part of the pension of my King &amp; Lord to whom I ow thanks &amp; not to a creature. I thank God that God is God, &amp; Christ is Christ, &amp; the earth the earth, &amp; the Devil the devil, and the world the world, &amp; that sin is sin, and that every thing is what it is: Because he hath taught me in my wilderness not to shuffle my Lord Jesus, nor to intermix him with creature-va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:57570:130"/>
nor to spin or twine Christ or his sweet love in one web, or in one threed with the world and the things thereof. Oh if I could hold and keep Christ all alone and mix him with nothing! O if I could cry down the price and weight of my cursed self and cry up the price of Christ, and double &amp; triple and augment and heighten to millions the price &amp; worth of Christ! I am [if I durst speak so &amp; might lawfully complain] so hungredly tutour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Christ Jesus my liberall Lord, that his nice love which my soul would be in hands with, flyeth me; &amp; yet I am trained on to love him, &amp; lust &amp; long &amp; die for his love whom I cannot see: it is a wonder to pine away with love for a covered &amp; hid lover, &amp; to be hungred with his love, so as a poor soul cannot get his fill of hunger for Christ: It is hard to be hungered of hunger, whereof such abundance for other things is in the world: But sure if we were tutours and stewards and Masters, and Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carvers of Christ's love, we should be more lean &amp; worse fed then we are: Our meat doeth us the more good, that Christ keepeth the keys, &amp; that the wind &amp; the air of Christ's sweet breathing &amp; of the influence of his spirit is locked up in the hands of the good pleasure of him, who bloweth where he listeth: I see there is a sort of impatient patience required in the want of Christ as to his manifestations, &amp; waiting on: They thrive who wait on his love &amp; the blowing of it &amp; the turning of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious wind; &amp; they thrive who in that on-waiting make haste and din and much adoe for their lost and hidden Lord Jesus: However it be, God feed me with him any way. If he would come in, I shall not dispute the matter, where he got a hole, or how he opened the lock: I should be content that Christ and I met, suppose he should stand on the other side of hell's lake and cry to me, <hi>Either put in your foot &amp; come through, else ye shall not have me at all.</hi> But what fools are we in the taking up of him and of his dealing! He hath a gate of his own beyond the thoughts of men, that no foot hath skill to follow him: But we are still ill Scholars and will goe in at heavens gates wanting the half of our lesson, and shall still be bairns so long as we are under time's hands, and till eternity cause a sun to arise in our souls that shall give us wit.

Pray for me [I forget not you] that our Lord would be pleased to lend me house-room to preach his righteousness &amp; tell what I have heard &amp; seen of him.

But her bill is cast by them, &amp; Holiness hideth it self, fearing the streets for the reporoaches &amp; persecution of men: Justice is fallen a swoon in the gate, &amp; the long shadows of the evening are stretched out upon us: Woe, woe to us, for our day flyeth away: what remaineth but that the Antichrist set down his tent in the midst of us, except your Lo: &amp; others with you read Christ's supplication, &amp; give him that which the most lewd and scandalous wretches in this land may have before a judge, even the poor man's due, <hi>law and jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice for God's sake.</hi> O therefore, <hi>my noble &amp; dear Lord,</hi> as ye have begun, goe on in the mighty power and strength of the Lord, to cause our Lord in his Gospel and afflicted members laugh, &amp; to cause the Christian Churches [whose eyes are all now upon you] to sing for joy, when <hi>Scotland's</hi> moon shall shine like the light of the sun, &amp; the sun like the light of seven dayes in one: ye can doe noless then run &amp; bear up the head of your dying &amp; swooning mother-Church, &amp; plead for the production of her ancient charters: They hold out and put out, they hold in and bring in at their pleasure men in God's house; they stole the keys from Christ and his Church, and came in like the thief &amp; the robber, not by the door Christ; &amp; now their song is, <hi>Authority, Authority, obedience to Church-Governours.</hi> When such a bastard &amp; lawless pretended step-dame as our prelacy is gone mad, it is your place who are the Nobles to rise &amp;

binde them; at least, law should fetter such wilde bulls as they are, who push all who oppose themselves to their domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Alas! What have we lost since Prelats were made Master coiners to change our gold in brass, and to mix the Lord's wine with their water? Blessed for ever shall ye be of the Lord if ye help Christ against the mighty, and shall deliver the flock of God scattered upon the mountains in the dark &amp; cloudy day, out of the hands of these idol-shepherds. Fear not men that shall be moth-eaten-clay that shall be rolled up in a chest, &amp; casten under the earth: Let the holy one of <hi>Israel</hi> be your fear, &amp; be couragious for the Lord and his truth. Remember your accounts coming upon you with wings, as fast as time posteth away: Remember what peace with God in Christ &amp; the presence of the Son of God in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed &amp; felt sweetness of his love, will be to you, when <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> shall put <hi>time</hi> to the door, &amp; ye shall take <hi>good-night</hi> at <hi>Time,</hi> &amp; this little shepherd's tent of clay, this Innes of a bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed earth.

I beseech you, Madam, in the Lord make now sure work, &amp; see that the old house be casten down, &amp; razed from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and that the new building of your soul be of Christ's own laying; for then wind and storm shall neither loose it, nor shake it asunder.

I finde his sweet presence eateth out the bitterness of sorrow &amp; suffering.

               <p>GRace, mercy &amp; peace be unto you: Though all Galloway should have forgotten me I would have expected a letter from you ere now: But I will not expound it to be forgetfulness of me. Now, <hi>My dear Brother,</hi> I cannot shew you how matters goe betwixt Christ and me: I finde my Lord going and coming seven times a day: His visits are short, but they are both frequent &amp; sweet. I dare not for my life think of a challenge of my Lord: I hear ill tales, &amp; hard reports of Christ from the Tempter and my flesh; but love beleeveth no evil: I may swear that they are lyars, and that apprehensions make lyes of Christ's honest and unalterable love to me. I dare not say that I am a dry tree, or that I have no room at all in the vineyard; but yet I often think that the sparrows are blessed who may resort to the house of God in <hi>Anwoth,</hi> from which I am banished. Temptations that I supposed to be striken dead and laid upon their back, rise again and revive upon me; yea. I see that while I live temptations will not die: The devil seemeth to brag &amp; boast as much, as if he had more court with Christ then I have, &amp; as if he had charmed &amp; blasted my ministery that I shall doe no more good in publike; but his wind shaketh no corn: I will not beleeve Christ would have made such a mint to have me to himself, and have taken so much pains upon me as he hath done, and then slip so easily from possession, and lose the glory of what he had done; Nay, since I came to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berden</hi> I have been taken up to see the new land, the fair pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace

I see faith's necessity in a fair day is never known aright; but now I miss nothing so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as faith: Hunger in me runneth to fair and sweet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, but when I come, I am like a hungry man that wanteth teeth, or a weak stomack having a sharp appetite that is filled with the very sight of meat; or lik one stupified with cold under the water that would fain come to land, but cannot grip any thing casten to him: I can let Christ grip me, but I cannot grip him: I love to be kissed and to sit on Christ's knee; but I cannot set my feet to the ground, for afflictions bring the cramp upon my faith: All I dow doe is to hold out a lame faith to Christ, like a begger holding out a stump in stead of an arm or leg and cry <hi>Lord Iesus work a miracle.</hi> O what would I give to have hands &amp; arms to grip strongly &amp; fold heart somly about Christ's neck, &amp; to have my claim made good with reall posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion! I think my love to Christ hath feet abundance, &amp; ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth swiftly to be at him, but it wanteth hands and fingers to apprehend him. I think I would give Christ every morning my blessing, to have as much faith as I have love &amp; hunger; at least I miss faith more then love &amp; hunger. 2. I see mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; to be crucified to the world is not so highly accounted of by us as it should be. O how heavenly a thing is it to be dead &amp; dumb &amp; deaf to this world's sweet musick! I confess it hath pleased his Majesty to make me laugh at children who are wooing this world for their match: I see men lying about the world, as Nobles about a King's court; &amp; I wonder what they are a doing there: As I am at this present I would scorn to court such a feckless &amp; petty Princesse, or buy this world's kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness with <hi>a bow of my knee.</hi> I scarce now either hear or see what it is that this world offereth me; I know it's little it can take from me, &amp; as little it can give me.

Praise, praise with me. O if ye &amp; I betwixt us could lift up Christ upon his throne, howbeit all <hi>Scotland</hi> should cast him down to the ground! My Brother's case toucheth me neer, I hope ye will be kinde to him &amp; give him your best counsel: Remember my love to your Brother, to your wife &amp; G.

I cannot get help to praise his high name: He hath made me a King over my losses, imprisonment, banishment &amp; onely my dumb sabbaths stick in my throat: But I forgive Christ's wisdom in that: I dare not say one word: He hath done it &amp; I will lay my hand upon my mouth: If any other had done it to me, I could not have born it. Now <hi>My Lord,</hi> I must tell your Lo: That I would not give a drink of cold water for this clay idol, this plaistered world. I testifie &amp; give it under mine own hand, that Christ is most worthy to be suffered for.

As for my self I am here in good case, well feasted with a great King: At my first coming here, I was that bold as to to take up a jealousie of Christ's love: I said I was cast over the dike of the Lord's vineyard as a dry tree; but I see if I had been a withered branch, the fire would have burnt me long ere now: blessed be his high name who hath kept sap in the dry tree: &amp; now as if Christ had done the wrong, he hath made the mends, &amp; hath miskent my ravings [for a man under the water can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well command his wit, far less his faith &amp; love] because it was a fever, my Lord Jesus forgave me that among the rest: He knoweth, in our afflictions we can finde a spot in the fairest face that ever was, even in Christ's face: I would not have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved that a gloom should have made me to misken my old Master; But we must be whiles sick: Sickness is but kindly to both faith &amp; Love. But O how execedingly is a poor dâted prisoner obliged to sweet Jesus! My tears are sweeter to me, then the laughter of the fourteen Prelats to them: The worst of Christ, even his chaff, is better then the world's corn. <hi>Dear Brother,</hi> I beseech you, I charge you in the name &amp; authority of the Son of God, help me to praise his highness, &amp; I charge you also to tell all your acquaintance, that my Master may get many thanks.

Oh that I could give up with this clay-idol, this masked painted overguilded dirt, that Adam's sons adore!

The dross of my cross, gathered a scum of fearsin the fire, doubtings, impatience, unbelief, challenging of providence as sleeping, &amp; not regarding my sorrow; but my gold smith Christ was pleased to take off the scum &amp; burn it in the fire: And blessed be my finer he hath

I see not how to be thankfull, or how to get help to praise that royall King who raiseth up these that are bowed down. 2.

If Christ had in this matter been as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full &amp; short as I was, my faith had gone over the brae &amp; broken it's neck; But we were well met, a hastie fool &amp; a wise patient &amp; meek Saviour: he took no law-advantage of my folly, but waited on till my ill blood was fallen &amp; my drumbled &amp; troubled well began to clear: He was never a whit angry at the fever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravings of a poor tempted sinner; but he mercifully forgave, &amp; came (as it well becometh him) with grace &amp; new comfort to a a sinner, who deserved the contrary: And now he is content to kiss my black mouth, to put his hand in mine, &amp; to feed me with as many consolations as would feed ten hungry souls; Yet I dare not say he is a waster of comforts, for no less would have born me up, one grain weight less would have casten the ballance.

That hours of the day less or more time, for the word &amp; prayer, be given to God, not sparing the twelfth hour or midday, howbeit it should then be the shorter time. 2. In the midst of wordly employments, there would be some thoughts of <hi>sin, judgement, death &amp; eternity,</hi> with a word or two of ejaculatory prayer [at least] to God. 3. To beware of wandering of heart in privat prayers. 4. Not to grudge howbeit ye come from pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er without sense or joy: Down-casting, sense of guiltiness &amp; hunger is often best for us. 5. That the Lord's day from morning to night be spent alwayes either in private or publike worship. 6. That words be observed, wandering and idle thoughts be avoided, sudden anger &amp; desire of revenge, even of such as persecute the truth, be guarded against; for we often mix our zeal with our own wilde fire. 7. That known, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered &amp; revealed sins that are against the conscience be eshewed as most dangerous preparative, to hardness of heart. 8. That in dealing with men, faith &amp; truth in covenants &amp; traffiquing be regarded, that we deal with all men in sincerity, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science be made of idle &amp; lying words, &amp; that our carriage be such as that they who see it, may speak honourably of our sweet Master and profession. 9. I have been much challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 1. For not referring all to God as the last end: That I doe not eat, drink, sleep, journey, speak and think for God. 2. That I have not benefited by good company, &amp; that I left not some word of conviction even upon naturall and wicked men, as by reproving swearing in them, or because of being a silent witness to their loose carriage, &amp; because I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not in all companies to doe good. 3. That the woes &amp; calamities of the Kirk &amp; particular professors have not moved me. 4. That the reading of the life of <hi>David, Paul</hi> &amp; the like when it humbled me, I [coming so far short of their holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness] laboured not to imitate them afar off at least, according
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:57570:141"/>
to the measure of God's grace. 5. That unrepented sins of youth were not looked to &amp; lamented for. 6. That sudden stirrings of pride, lust, revenge, love of honours were not resisted &amp; mourned for. 7. That my charity was cold. 8. That the experiences I had of God's hearing me in this &amp; the other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, being gathered; yet in a new trouble I had alwayes [once at least] my faith to seek, as if I were to begin at A. B. C. Again. 9. That I have not more boldly contradicted the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies speaking against the truth, either in publike church-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or at tables, or ordinary conference. 10. That in great troubles I have received false reports of Christ's love &amp; misbeleeved him in his chastning, whereas the event hath said <hi>all was in mercy.</hi> 11. Nothing more moveth me &amp; weighteth my soul, then that I could never for my heart in my prosperity, so wrestle in prayer with God, nor be so dead to the world, so hungry &amp; sick of love for Christ, so heavenly minded, as when ten stone weight of a heavy cross was upon me. 12. That the cross extorted vows of new obedience which ease hath blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en away as chaff before the wind. 13. That practice was so short &amp; narrow, &amp; light so long &amp; broad. 14. That death hath not been often meditated upon. 15. That I have not been carefull of gaining others to Christ. 16. That my grace &amp; gifts bring forth little or no thankfulness. There are somethings also whereby I have been helped: As, 1. I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefited by riding alone a long journey, in giving that time to prayer. 2. By abstinence &amp; giving dayes to God. 3. By praying for others; for by making an errand to God for them; I have gotten something for my self. 4. I have been really confirmed in many particulars that God heareth prayers, and therefore I used to pray for any thing of how little importance soever. 5. He enabled me to make no question that this mocked way, which is nicknamed, is the onely way to heaven. <hi>Sir,</hi> these &amp; many moe occurrences in your life would be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto: &amp;, 1. Thoughts of <hi>Atheisme</hi> would be watched over as <hi>If there be a God in heaven:</hi> Which will trouble &amp; assault the best at some times. 2. Growth in grace would be cared for above all things, &amp; falling from our first love mourned for.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:57570:141"/>
3. Conscience made of praying for the enemies who are blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Sir,</hi> I thank you most kindly for your care of my brother &amp; me also: I hope it is laid up for you and remembred in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. I am still ashamed with Christ's kindness to such a sinner as I am: He hath left a fire in my heart that hell cannot cast water on to quench or extinguish it. Help me to praise and pray for me: for ye have a prisoner's blessing &amp; prayers. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member my love to your wife. Grace be with you.</p>

               <p>GRace, mercy &amp; peace be unto you: I thought to have answered your two letters upon this occasion; though I cannot say all that I would. Your timeous word <hi>[not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the cross, but in him who sweetneth it]</hi> came to me in due time: I finde the consolations &amp; off-fallings that follow the cross of Christ so sweet, that I almost forget my self: my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire &amp; purpose is, when Christ's honey combs drop, neither to refuse to receive &amp; feed upon his comforts, nor yet to make <hi>joy,</hi> my bastard-god, or my new found heaven: But what shall I say? Christ very often in his sweet comforts cometh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent for, &amp; it were a sin to close the door upon him: It is not unlawfull to love &amp; delight in Christ's apples, when I am not dottingly wooing, nor eagerly begging kisses: but when they come clean from the timber [like kindness it self that cometh of it's own accord] then I cannot but laugh upon him, who laugheth upon me: If joy &amp; comforts came single &amp; alone, without Christ himself, I think I would send them back again the gate they came, and not make them wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; But when the King's train cometh, and the King in the midst of the company, O how am I overjoyed with floods of love! I fear not that too great speats,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:57570:142"/>
of love wash away the growing corn, &amp; loose my plants at the roots: Christ doeth no <hi>skaith</hi> where he cometh; but certainly I would wish such spirituall wisdom as to love the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom better then his gifts, his propines, or drink-money. I would be further in upon Christ then at his joyes; they but stand in the utter side of Christ: I would wish to be <hi>in</hi> as a seal on his heart, <hi>in</hi> where his love &amp; mercy lodgeth, beside his heart. My welbeloved hath ravished me; but it is done with consent of parties, &amp; it is allowable enough: But <hi>my dear Brother,</hi> ere I part with this subject, I must tell you, [that ye may lift up my King in praises with me] Christ hath been keeping something these fourteen years for me, that I have now gotten in my heavy dayes, that I am in for his name sake; even an open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed coffer of perfumed comforts &amp; fresh joyes coming new, &amp; green, &amp; powerfull from the fairest, fairest face of Christ my Lord. Let the sowre law, let crosses, let hell be cryed down: Love, love hath shamed me from my old wayes. Whether I have a race to run or some work adoe, I see not; but I think, Christ seemeth to leave heaven [to say so] &amp; his court, &amp; come down to laugh &amp; play &amp; sport with a daft bairn. I am not this plain with many I write to: It is possible I be misconstructed &amp; deemed to seek a name; but my witness above knoweth, I seek to have a good name raised upon Christ. I observe it to be our folly, to seek little from Christ; because our <hi>four-hours</hi> may not be our supper: nor our propine sent by the Bridegroom our tocher-good; nor our earnest our principal summe: But I trow few of us know how much may be had of Christ for a four-hours &amp; a propine &amp; earnest: We are like the young heir who knoweth not the whole bounds of his own Lordship. Certainly it is more then my part to say, <hi>O sweetest Lord Iesus, what ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

cushion &amp; sweet peace for a sufferer: Christ's trencher from the first mess of the high-table is for a sinfull witness. O then <hi>Brother,</hi> who but Christ! Who but Christ? Hold your tongue of lovers where he cometh out! O all flesh, O dust &amp; ashes, O Angels, O glorified spirits, O all the shields of the world, be silent before him, come hither &amp; behold our Bridegroom, stand still &amp; wonder for evermore at him! Why cease we to love &amp; wonder, to kiss &amp; adore him? It is a hard matter that dayes lie betwixt me &amp; him &amp; hold us asunder. O how long, how long!

It is ill my common to be swier to goe an errand for Christ, &amp; to take the wind upon my face for him. <hi>Lord,</hi> let me never be a false witness to deny that I saw Christ take the pen in his hand &amp; subscribe my writes. <hi>My Dear Brother,</hi> ye complain to me ye cannot hold sight of me; but were I a foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man I should goe at leisure, but sometimes the King taketh me into his coach, &amp; draweth me; &amp; then I ontrun myself; but alas I am still a forlorn transgressour: O how unthankfull!

I would not have you to bring your dittay in your own bosom with you to Christ: Let the old man &amp; the new man be summoned before Christ's white throne, &amp; let them be confronted before Christ, &amp; let each one of them speak for themselves: I hope howbeit the new man complain of his lying among the pots, which maketh the beleever look black; yet he can say also, <hi>I am comely as the tents of Kedar:</hi> Ye shall not have my advice not to bemoan your deadness: but I finde by some experience [which ye knew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I knew Christ] it suiteth not a ransomed man of Christ's buying, to goe &amp; plea for <hi>the sowre law,</hi> our old forecaste<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I am every way in your case, as hard heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed &amp; dead as any man; but yet I speak to Christ through my sleep: Let us then proclaim a free market for Christ &amp; swear our selves <hi>bare,</hi> &amp; desire, &amp; cry on him to come without money &amp; buy us, &amp; take us home to our ransom-payer's fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, &amp; let us be Christ's free-boarders: because we dow not pay the old, we may not refuse to take on Christ's new debt of mercy: Let us doe our best, Christ will still be behinde with us, &amp; many terms will run together: For my part let me stand for evermore in his book for a forlorn Dyvour: I must desire to be this far in his common of new, as to desire to kiss his feet: I know not how to win to a heartsom fill &amp; feast of Christ's love; for I dow neither buy, nor beg, nor borrow: &amp; yet I cannot want it: I dow not want it.

Alas he is more then praises! I give it over to get him exalted according to his worth, which is above what can be known; yet all this time I am te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pting him to see if there be both love &amp; anger in him against me.

Tell me Lord, read the process against me:</hi> but I know I cannot answer his alleagance: I will lose the cause when it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to open pleading. Oh if I could force my heart to beleeve dreams to be dreams! Yet when Christ giveth my fears the lye &amp; saith to me <hi>thou art a lyar,</hi> then I am glad.

When all is done what can I adde to him? or what can such a clay-shadow as I doe? I know he needeth not me: I have cause to be grieved and to melt away in tears [if I had grace to doe it, Lord grant it to me] to see my wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloved's fair face spitted upon by dogs, to see lowns pulling the crown off my royall King's head, to see my harlot-mother &amp; my sweet father agree so ill, that they are going to skail and give up house: My Lord's palace is now a nest of unclean birds. Oh if harlot, harlot <hi>Scotland</hi> would rue upon her provoked Lord; &amp; pity her good husband, who is broken with her whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish heart!

Now for your question as far as I rawly conceive: I think God is praised two wayes: <hi>First,</hi> by a <hi>concional</hi> profession of his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness before men, such as is the very hearing of the word, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of either of the Sacraments, in which acts by profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, we give out to men, that he is our God, with whom we are in covenant, &amp; our Lawgiver: Thus eating &amp; drinking in the Lord's supper, is an annunciation &amp; profession before men, that Christ is our slain Redeemer: Here because God speaketh to us, not we to him, it is not a formal thanks giving; but an annunciation, or predication of Christ's death, <hi>concionall,</hi> not <hi>adorative;</hi> neither hath it <hi>God</hi> for the immediat object, and therefore no kneeling can be here. <hi>Secondly,</hi> there is another praising of God, <hi>formal,</hi> when we are either formally blessing God, or speaking his praises: And this I take to be twofold: 1. When we directly &amp; formally direct praises and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving to God: This may well be done kneeling in token of our recognizance of his highness; yet not so, but it may be standing or sitting, especially seeing joyfull elevation [which should be in praising] is not formally signified by kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 2. When we speak good of God, &amp; declare his glorious nature &amp; attributes, extolling him before men, to excite men to conceive highly of him: The former I hold to be worship every way immediat, else I know not any immediat worship at all: the latter hath God for the subject, not properly the object, seeing the predication is directed to men immediatly, rather then to God; for here we speak of God by way of praising, rather then to God: And for my own part, as I am for the present minded, I see not how this can be done kneeling seeing it is <hi>praedicatio Dei &amp; Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:57570:146"/>
is <hi>formal</hi> praising of God &amp; not meerly <hi>concional,</hi> as I distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished in the first member: for in the first member any speaking of God or of his works of creation, providence &amp; redemption, is indirect &amp; concional praising of him, &amp; formally preaching or an act of teaching, not an act of predication of his praises; for there is a difference betwixt the simple relation of the vertues of a thing, which is formally teaching, &amp; the extolling of the worth of a thing by way of commendation, to cause others to praise with us. Thus recommending you to God's grace, I rest.</p>

               <p>GRace, mercy &amp; peace be unto you: upon the report I hear of you [without any further acquaintance except our strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est bonds in our Lord Jesus] I thought good to write unto you, hearing of your danger to be thrust out of the Lord's house for his name sake: Therefore my earnest &amp; humble desire to God is, that ye may be strengthned in the grace of God, &amp; by the power of his might to goe on for Christ, not standing in aw of a worm that shall die. I hope ye will not put your hand to the ark to give it a wrong <hi>totch</hi> &amp; to overturn it, as many now doe, when the archers are shooting sore at Joseph, whose bowe shall abide in it's strength: We ow to our royall King &amp; Princely Master a testimony. O how blessed are they who can warde a blow off Christ &amp; his born-down truth! Men think Christ <hi>a gone man</hi> now, &amp; that he shall never get up his head again: And they beleeve his court is failed, because he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth men to break their spears &amp; swords upon him, and the enemies to plow Sion, &amp; make long &amp; deep their furrows on her back: But it would not be so, if the Lord had not a sowing for his plowing: What can he doe, but melt an old drossie Kirk, that he may bring out a new bride out of the fire again <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

I think Christ is just now reparing his house, &amp; exchanging his old vessels with new vessels, &amp; is going through this land and taking up an inventure &amp; a roll of so many of <hi>Levi's</hi> sons &amp; good Professors, that he may make them new work for the second temple: And whatsoever shall be found, not to be for the work shall be casten over the wall: When the house shall be builded, he shall lay by his hammers as having no more to doe with them: It is possible he doe worse to them then lay them by: &amp; I think <hi>the vengeance of the Lord &amp; the venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his temple shall be upon them:</hi> I desire no more but to keep weight when I am past the fire: &amp; I can now in some weak measure give Christ a testimonial of a lovely &amp; loving compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion under suffering for him. I saw him before but afar off; his beauty to my eye's sight groweth: a fig, a straw for ten worlds plaistered glory &amp; for childish shadows: The idol of clay [this God, <hi>the world]</hi> that fools fight for. If I had a lease of Christ of my own dating [for whoever once cometh nigh hand &amp; taketh a hearty look of Christ's inner side, shall never wring nor wrestle themselves out of his love-grips again] I would rest contented in my prison; yea in a prison without light of sun or candle, providing Christ &amp; I had a love-bed, not of mine but of Christ his own making; that we might lie together among the lilies, till the day break &amp; the shadows flee away. Who knoweth how sweet a drink of Christ's love is? O but to live on Christ's love is a King's life! The worst things of Christ even that which seemeth to be the refuse of Christ, his hard cross, his black cross, is white &amp; fair: &amp; the cross receiveth a beautifull lustre &amp; a perfumed smell from Jesus, <hi>Mydear Brother,</hi> scar not at it. While ye have time to stand upon the watch tower &amp; to speak, contend with this land, plead with your harlot-mother, who hath been a treacherous half-marrow to her husband <hi>Iesus:</hi> For I would think liberty to preach one day, the root &amp; top of my desires, &amp; would seek no more of the blessings that are to be had on this side of time, till I be over the water; but to spend this my crazed clay-house in his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice &amp; saving of souls: But I hold my peace because he hath done it: my shallow &amp; ebbe thoughts are not the compass
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:57570:147"/>
Christ saileth by: I leave his wayes to himself for they are far, far above me: Onely I would contend with Christ for his love and be bold to make a plea with Jesus my Lord for a heart-fill of his love; for there is no more left to me. What standeth beyond the far end of my sufferings, and what shall be the event he knoweth, and I hope to my joy shall make me know, when God shall unfold his decrees concerning me; for there are windings and too's and fro's in his wayes which blinde bodies like us cannot see. This much for further acquaintance: So recommending you &amp; what is before you to the grace of God, I rest.</p>

Let me entreat you, <hi>my dearly beloved,</hi> to be fast to Christ: My witness is above, <hi>My dearest Brother,</hi> that ye have added much joy to me in my bonds, when I hear that ye grow in the grace and zeal of God for your Master.

let him doe with me &amp; it both what he thinketh good: I think my self too little for him: &amp; let me speak to you, how kinde a fellow prisoner is Christ to me! Beleeve me, this kinde of cross [that would not goe by my door, but would needs visite me,] is still the longer the more welcome to me: It's true my silent sabbaths have been &amp; are still as glassy yee, whereon my faith can scarce hold it's feet, &amp; I am often blowen on my back, and off my feet, with a storm of doubting; yet truly my bonds all this time cast a mighty and ranck smell of high and deep love in Christ: I cannot indeed see through my cross to the far end; Yet I beleeve I am in Christ's books, &amp; in his decree [not yet unfolded to me] a man triumphing, dancing &amp; singing over on the other side of the red sea, &amp; laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; praising the lamb over beyond time, sorrow, depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, prelat's indignation, losses, want of friends &amp; death: Heaven is not a foul flying in the air (as men use to speak of things that are uncertain) nay it is well paid for, Christ's comprizement lieth on <hi>Glory,</hi> for all the mourners in Zion, &amp; shall never be loosed: Let us be glad &amp; rejoyce that we have blood, losses, &amp; wounds to show our Master &amp; Captain at his appearance, and what we suffered for his cause. Woe is me, <hi>my dear Brother,</hi> that I say often I am but dry bones, which my Lord will not bring out of the grave again, &amp; that my faithless fears say, <hi>Oh I am a dry tree that can bear no fruit, I am an useless body who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But I am but a short sighted creature &amp; my candle casteth not light afar off: He knoweth all that is done to me, how that when I had but one joy &amp; no more, &amp; one green flower that I esteemed to be my garland, he came in one hour &amp; dried up my flower at the root, &amp; took away mine onely eye, &amp; mine onely one crown &amp; garland: What can I say? Surely my guiltiness hath been remembered before him, &amp; he was seeking to take down my sails &amp; to land the flower of my delights, and to let it lie on the coast like an old broken ship that is no more for the sea: But I praise him for this wailed stroke, I welcome this surnace, God's wisdom made choice of it for me, &amp; it must be best because it was his choice. O that I may wait for him till the morning of this benighted Kirk break out! This poor afflicted Kirk had a fair morning; but her night came upon her before her noon-day, &amp; she was like a traveller forced to take house in the morning of his journey: &amp; now her adversaries are the chief men in the land, her wayes mourn, her gates languish, her children sigh for bread, and there is none to be instant with the Lord, that he would come again to his house &amp; dry the face of his weeping spouse &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort <hi>Zion's</hi> mourners, who are waiting for him: I know, he shall make corn to grow upon the top of his withered mount <hi>Zion</hi> again. Remember my bonds &amp; forget me not: Oh that my Lord would bring me again amongst you with abundance of the Gospel of Christ! But O that I may set down my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires where my Lord biddeth me! Remember my love in the Lord to your husband, God make him faithfull to Christ, &amp;

               <p>I Earnestly desire to know the case of your soul, &amp; to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that ye have made sure work of heaven &amp; salvation. 1. Remember, Salvation is one of Christ's dainties he giveth but to a few. 2. That it is violent sweating &amp; striving that taketh heaven. 3. That it cost Christ blood to purchase that house to sinners &amp; to set mankinde down, the King's free ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants &amp; free-holders. 4. That many make a start toward heaven who fall on their back &amp; win not up to the top of the mount, it plucketh heart &amp; legs from them, &amp; they sit down &amp; give it over, because the devil setteth a sweet smelled flower to their nose [this fair busked World] wherewith they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched &amp; so forget or refuse to goe forward. 5. Remember, many goe far on &amp; reform many things &amp; can finde tears as <hi>Esau</hi> did, &amp; suffer hunger for the truth as <hi>Iudas</hi> did, &amp; wish &amp; desire the end of the righteous as <hi>Balaam</hi> did, &amp; profess fair &amp; fight for the Lord as <hi>Saul</hi> did, &amp; desire the saints of God to pray for them as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> &amp; <hi>Simon Magus</hi> did, &amp; prophesie &amp; speak of Christ as <hi>Caiaphas</hi> did, walk softly &amp; mourn for fear of judgement as <hi>Ahab</hi> did, &amp; put away gross sins &amp; idolatry as <hi>Iehu</hi> did, &amp; hear the word of God gladly &amp; reform their life in many things according to the word as <hi>Herod</hi> did, &amp; say, <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> to Christ, <hi>I will follow thee whither soever thou goest,</hi> as the man who offered to be Christ's servant, <hi>Math.</hi> 8. &amp; may taste of the

vertues of the life to come &amp; be partaker of the wonderfull gifts of the holy spirit &amp; taste of the good word of God, as the <hi>Apostates</hi> who sin against the Holy Ghost, <hi>Heb</hi> 6. &amp; yet all these are but like gold in clink &amp; colour &amp; watered brass &amp; base mettall. These are written that we should try our selves &amp; not rest till we be a step nearer Christ then sun-burnt &amp; withering professors can come, 6. Consider, it is impossible that your Idol-sins &amp; ye, can goe to heaven together, &amp; that they who will not part with these, can indeed love Christ at the bottom; but onely in word &amp; shew: which will not doe the business. 7. Remember how swiftly God's post, <hi>time,</hi> flieth away, &amp; that your forenoon is already spent, your afternoon will come &amp; then your even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; at last night, When ye cannot see to work: let your heart be set upon finishing of your journey, &amp; summing &amp; laying your accounts with your Lord. O how blessed shall ye be, to have a joyfull welcome of your Lord at night! How blessed are they who in time take sure course with their soul! Bless his great name for what ye possess in goods &amp; children, ease &amp; worldly contentment, that he hath given you; &amp; seek to be like Christ in humility &amp; lowliness of minde, &amp; be not great &amp; intire with the world: make it not your God nor your lover that ye trust into; for it will deceive you: I recommend Christ &amp; his love to you in all things, let him have the flower of your heart &amp; your love, set a low price upon all things but Christ, &amp; cry down in your thoughts clay &amp; dirt that will not comfort you, when ye get summonds to remove, &amp; compear before your Judge, to answer for all the deeds done in the body. The Lord give you wisdom in all things: I beseech you sanctifie God in your speaking, for holy and reverend is his name: &amp; be temperate &amp; sober, compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onry [as it is called] is a sin that holdeth men out of heaven. I will not beleeve that ye will receive the ministry of a stranger, who will preach a new &amp; uncouth doctrine to you: Let my salvation stand for it, if I delivered not the plain &amp; whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of God to you in his word. Read this letter to your wife, &amp; remember my love to her, &amp; request her to take heed to doe what I write to you: I pray for you &amp; yours. Remember me

               <p>WHo knoweth but the wind may turn in to the West again upon Christ &amp; his desolate bride in this land? And that Christ may get his summer by course again; for he hath had ill weather this long time, &amp; could not finde law or justice for himself &amp; his truth these many years. I am sure, the wheels of this crazed &amp; broken Kirk run all upon no other axel-tree, nor is there any other to roll them, &amp; cogge them, &amp; drive them, but the wisdom &amp; good pleasure of our Lord: And it were a just trick &amp; glorious, of never-sleeping providence, to bring our brethrens darts they have shot at us, back upon their own heads: Suppose they have two strings in their bow, &amp; can take one as another saileth them, yet there are moe then three strings upon our Lord's bowe; and besides he cannot miss the white that he shooteth at. I know, he shuffleth up &amp; down in his hand the great body of heaven &amp; earth, &amp; that Kirk &amp; Commonwealth are in his hand, like a stock of Cards, &amp; that he dealeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

O how sweet a thing it is to trust in him! When Christ hath sleeped out his sleep [if I may speak so of him who is the watch-man of <hi>Israel</hi> that neither slumbereth nor sleepeth] and his own are tried, he will arise as a strong man after wine, and make bare his holy arm, and put on vengeance as a cloak, and deal vengeance thick &amp; double amongst the hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>Zion.</hi> It may be we see him sow and send down maledic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

On-waiting had ever yet a blessed issue, &amp; to keep the word of God's patience keepeth still the saints dry in the water, cold in the fire, &amp; breathing &amp; blood-hot in the grave. What are prisons of iron walls &amp; gates of brass to Christ? Not so good as feal dikes, fortifications of straw, or old tottering walls: If he give the word, then the chains will fall off the arms &amp; legs of his prisoners. God be thanked that our Lord Jesus hath the tutouring of King and Court and Nobles, and that he can dry the gutters and the mires in <hi>Sion,</hi> and lay causeys to the Temple with the carcases of bastard Lord-Prelats &amp; idol-shepherds: The corn on the house-tops got never the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-man's prayers, &amp; so is seen on it, for it filleth not the hand of mowers. Christ &amp; truth &amp; innocency worketh even under the earth, &amp; verily there is hope for the righteous: We see not what conclusions pass in heaven anent all the affaris of God's house: we need not give hire to God to take vengeance of his enemies; for Justice worketh without hire. O that the seed of hope would grow again and come to maturity! And that we could importune Christ &amp; double our knocks at his gate, &amp; cast our cries &amp; shouts over the wall, that he might come out &amp; make our <hi>Ierusalem</hi> the praise of the whole earth, &amp; give us Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for walls &amp; bulwarks!

Alas how doeth sin dog us in our journey &amp; retard us! What fools are we to have a by-god or an other lover or match to our souls beside Christ? It were best for us like ill bairns [who are best heard at home] to seek our own home, &amp; to sell our hopes of this little clay Innes &amp; idol of the earth, where we are neither well summered nor well wintered. Oh that our souls would fall so at oddes with the love of this world, as to think of it as a traveller doeth of a drink of water, which is not any part of his treasure, but goeth away with the using; for ten miles journey maketh that drink to him as nothing! O that we had as soon done with this world and could as quickly dispatch the love of it! But as a childe cannot hold two apples in his little hand, but the one putteth the other out of it's room; so neither can we be masters and Lords of two loves: Blessed were we if we could make our selves masters of that invaluable treasure the love of Christ; or rather suffer our selves to be mastered and subdued to Christ's love, so as Christ were our <hi>all things,</hi> &amp; all other things our <hi>nothings</hi> &amp; the refuse of our delights.

O what could we bairns doe without him! how soon would we mar all? But the less of our weight be upon our own feeble legs, and the more that we be on Christ the strong Rock the better for us: It is good for us that ever Christ took the cumber of us: it is our heaven to lay many weights and burdens upon Christ, and to make him all we have, root and top, beginning and ending of our salvation: Lord hold us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

My Lord now hath given me experience [howbeit weak &amp; small] that our best fare here is hunger; we are but at God's by-board in this lower house, we have cause to long for supper-time &amp; the high table, up in the high palace: This world deserveth nothing but the utter court of our soul. Lord hasten the marriage-supper of the Lamb. I finde it still peace to give up with this present world as with an old decourted &amp; cast-off lover: My bread &amp; drink in it, is not so much worth, that I should not loath the Innes, &amp; pack up my desires for Christ, that I have sent out to the feck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less creatures in it.

They think to make a nest for their hopes, and take quarters and conditions of hell and death, that they shall have ease, long life, peace, &amp; in the morning when the last trumpet shall awake them, then they rue the block. It is time &amp; high time for you to think upon death and your accounts, and to remember what ye are, where ye will be before the year of our Lord 1700. I hope ye are thinking upon this: pull upon your soul and draw it aside from the company that it is with, and round &amp; whisper in to it newes of eternity, death, judgement, heaven and hell. Grace, grace be with you.</p>

I were happy for evermore to get leave to stand but beside Christ and his love, and to look in, suppose I were interdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God to come near hand, touch or embrace, kiss or set too my sinfull head and drink my self drunken with that love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing.

see, more clearly then before, our folly in drinking dead wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters &amp; in playing the whore with our soul's love upon running<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wells, &amp; broken sheards of creatures of yesterday, whom Time will unlaw with the penalty of losing their being &amp; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ornaments. O when a soul's love is itching [to speak so] for God, and when Christ in his boundless and bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less love, beauty and excellency cometh &amp; rubbeth up &amp; excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that love, what can be heaven if this be not heaven? I am sure this bit feckless, narrow &amp; short love of regenerated sinners was born for no other end, but to breath &amp; live and love &amp; dwell in the bosom and betwixt the breasts of Christ: Where is there a bed or a lodging for the saints love but Christ? O that he would take our selves off our hand, for neither we nor the creatures can be either due conquest or lawfull heritage to love! Christ &amp; none but Christ is Lord &amp; proprietour of it. Oh alas, how pitifull is it that so much of our love goeth by him! O but we be wretched wasters of our soul's love! I know it is the deep of bottomless, and unsearchable providence, that the saints are suffered to play the whore from God, and that their love goeth a hunting, when God knoweth it shall rost no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that at supper-time: The renewed would have it otherwise; &amp; why is it so, seeing our Lord can keep us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out nodding, tottering or reeling, or any fall at all? Our desires I hope shall meet with perfection; but God will have our sins an office-house for God's grace, &amp; hath made sin a matter of an unlaw &amp; penalty for the Son of God's blood; &amp; howbeit <hi>sin</hi> should be our sorrow, yet there is a sort of acquiescing &amp; resting upon God's dispensation required of us, that there is such a thing in us as <hi>Sin,</hi> whereupon mercy, forgiveness, healing, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in our sweet Physician, may finde a field to work upon. O what a deep is here, that created wit cannot take up! However matters goe, it is our happiness to win new ground daily in Christ's love, and to purchase a new piece of it daily and to adde conquest to conquest, till our Lord Jesus &amp; we be so near other, that Satan shall not draw a straw or a threed betwixt us. And for my self, I have no greater joy in my welfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured bonds for Christ, then that I know, time shall put him

I dare avouch to all that know God, that the saints know not the length &amp; largeness of the sweet earnest &amp; of the sweet green sheaves before the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest, that might be had on this side of the water, if we should take more pains: And that we all goe to heaven with less earnest &amp; lighter purses of the hoped-for summe, then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise we might doe, if we took more pains to win further in upon Christ, in this pilgrimage of our absence from him.

               <p>I Am sorry that ye or so many in this Kingdom should expect so much of me an empty reed: Verily I am a naughty &amp; poor body: But if the tinkling of my Lord Jesus's iron chains on legs &amp; arms could sound the high praises of my royall King, whose prisoner I am, O how would my joy run over! If my Lord would bring edificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to one soul by my bonds, I am satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; but I know not what I can doe to such a princely &amp; beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full welbeloved: He is far behinde with me: Little thanks to me to say to others, his wind bloweth on me who am but withered &amp; dry bones: But since ye desire me to write to you, either help me to set Christ on high for his running-over love, in that the heat of his sweet breath hath melted a frozen heart, else I think ye doe nothing for a prisoner. I am fully confirmed that it is the honour of our Law-giver I suffer for now: I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to give out letters of recommendation of Christ's love to as many as will extoll the Lord Jesus &amp; his cross. If I had
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:57570:161"/>
not sailed this sea-way to heaven, but had taken the land-way as many doe, I should not have known Christ's sweetness in such a measure: But the truth is, let no man thank me; for I caused not Christ's wind to blow upon me: His love came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a withered creature whether I would or not; [&amp; yet by coming it procured from me a welcome] A heart of iron &amp; iron doors will not hold Christ out: I give him leave to break iron locks &amp; come in, &amp; that is al: &amp; now I know not whether pain of love for want of poss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For the <hi>First,</hi> O that he would come &amp; satisfie the longing soul &amp; fill the hungry soul with these good things? I know indeed my guiltiness may be a bar in his way, but he is God, &amp; ready to forgive: And for the other, woe, woe is me that I cannot finde a heart to give back again my unworthy little love for his great sea-full of love to me: O that he would learn me this piece of gratitude! O that I could have leave to look <hi>in</hi> thorow the hole of the door to see his face &amp; sing his praises! or could break up one of his chamber windows to look <hi>in</hi> upon his delighting beauty, till my Lord send more: any little communion with him, one of his love-looks should be my begun heaven: I know he is not Lordly, neither is the bridegroom's love proud, though I be black &amp; unlovely &amp; unworthy of him. I would seek but leave, &amp; withall, grace, to spend my love upon him: I counsel you to think highly of Christ &amp; of free, free grace more then ye did before; for I know that Christ is not known amongst us; I think I see more of Christ then ever I saw, &amp; yet I see but little of what may be seen: O that he would draw by the curtains &amp; that the King would come out of his gallerie &amp; his palace, that I might see him! Christ's love is young glory &amp; young heaven: It would soften hell's pains to be filled with it: What would I refuse to suffer, if I could but get a draught of love at my hearts desire? O what price can be given for him! Angels cannot weigh him, O his weight, his worth, his sweetness, his overpassing beauty! If men &amp; Angels would come &amp; look to that great &amp; Princely one, their ebbeness would never take up his depth, their narrowness would never comprehend his breadth height &amp;

length: If ten thousand thousand worlds of Angels were creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they might all tire themselves in wondering at his beauty, &amp; begin again to wonder of new. O that I could win nigh him to kiss his feet, to hear his voice, to finde the smell of his oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments! But Oh alas I have little, little of him; yet I long for more!

               <p>GRace, mercy &amp; peace be to you: I received your letter, which hath refreshed me in my bonds. I cannot but testifie unto you, <hi>my dear Brother,</hi> what sweetness I finde in our Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's cross; but alas, what can I either doe or suffer for him? If I my alone had as many lives as there have been drops of rain since the creation, I would think them too little for that lovely one, our welbeloved; but my pain and my sorrow is above my sufferings, that I finde not wayes how to set out the praises of his love to others: I am not able by tongue, pen or sufferings to provoke many to fall in love with him, but he knoweth whom I love to serve in the spirit, what I would doe &amp; suffer by his own strength, sobeing I might make my Lord Jesus lovely &amp; sweet to many thousands in this land. I think it amongst God's wonders that he will take any praise or glory or any testimony to his honourable cause, from such a forlorn sinner as I am: But when Christ worketh he needeth not ask the question by whom he will be glorious: I know, seeing his glory at the beginning did shine out of poor nothing to set up such a fair house for man &amp; Angels, &amp; so many glorious crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to proclaim his goodness, power &amp; wisdom, if I were burnt to ashes, out of the smoke and powder of my dissolved

body he could raise glory to himself: His glory is his end, Oh that I could joyn with him to make it my end! I would think that fellowship with him sweet &amp; glorious. But alas, few know the guiltiness that is on my part, it is a wonder that this good cause hath not been marred and spilt in my foul hands: But I rejoyce in this that my sweet Lord Jesus hath found something adoe, even a ready market for his free grace and incomparable and matchless mercy in my wants: Onely my loathsom wretchedness and my wants have qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified me for Christ and the riches of his glorious grace, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooved to take me for nothing or else to want me: Few know the unseen &amp; private reckonings betwixt Christ and me; yet his love, his boundless love would not bide away nor stay at home with himself, &amp; yet I dow not make it welcome as I ought, when it's come unsent for and without hire. How joyfull is my heart that ye write ye are desirous to joyn with me in praising; for it is charity to help a Dyvour to pay his debts; but when all have helped me, my name shall stand in his count-book under ten thousand thousands of summes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payed: But it easeth my heart that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I desire he may lay me in his own ballance &amp; weigh me, if I would not fain have a feast of his boundless love made to my own soul and to many others. One thing I know, we shall not all be able to come neer his excellency with eye, heart or tongue; for he is above all created thoughts; All nations before him are as nothing &amp; as less then nothing, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I think the sense of our wants, when withall we have a restlesness and a sort of spirituall impatience under them and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="272" facs="tcp:57570:163"/>
soul loveth, is that which maketh an open door to Christ: &amp; when we think we are going backward because we feel deadness, we are going forward: For the more sense the more life, &amp; no sense argueth no life. There is no sweeter fellowship with Christ, then to bring our wounds &amp; our sores to him. But for my self, I am ashamed of Christ's goodness &amp; love since the time of my bonds, for he hath been pleased to open up new treasures of love &amp; felt sweetness, &amp; give visitations of love &amp; access to himself in this strange land. I would think a fill of his love, young &amp; green heaven: &amp; when he is pleased to come, &amp; the tide is in, &amp; the sea full, &amp; the King &amp; a poor prisoner together in the house of wine, the black tree of the cross is not so heavie as a feather. I cannot, I dow not but give Christ an honourable and glorious testimony: I see, the Lord can ride through his enemies bands &amp; triumph in the sufferings of his own, &amp; that this blinde world seeth not, that <hi>Suffering</hi> is Christ's ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour wherein he is victorious: &amp; they that contend with <hi>Zion,</hi> see not what he is doing when they are set to work as under-smiths &amp; servants to the work of refining of the saints [Satan's hand also by them is at the melting of our Lord's vessels of mercy] and their office in God's house, is to scour &amp; cleanse vessels for the King's table. I marvel not to see them triumph &amp; sit at ease in <hi>Zion,</hi> our father must lay up his rods and keep them carefully for his own use: our Lord cannot want fire in his house, his furnace is in <hi>Zion</hi> &amp; his fire in <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> but little know the adversaries the counsel &amp; the thoughts of the Lord. And for your complaints of your ministry, I now think all I did too little: Plainness, freedom, watchfulness, fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, shall swell upon you in exceeding large comforts in your sufferings: The feeding of Christ's lambs in private visitations, &amp; catechising, in painfull preaching, &amp; fair, honest &amp; free warning of the flock is a sufferer's garland. O ten thousand times blessed are they, who are honoured of Christ to be faithfull and painfull in wooing a Bride to Christ! <hi>My dear Brother.</hi> I know ye think more on this then I can write, &amp; I rejoyce that your purpose is, in the Lord's strength to back your wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Master &amp; to come out &amp; call your self Christ's man, when
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:57570:163"/>
so many are now denying him, as fearing that Christ cannot doe for himself &amp; them. I am a lost man for ever, or this, this is the way to Salvation, even this way that they call Heresie, that men now doe mock &amp; scoff at. I am confirmed now that Christ will accept of his servants sufferings as good service to him at the day of his appearance, &amp; that ere it be long he will be upon us all, &amp; men in all their black's &amp; white's shall be brought out before God Angels and men. Our Master is not far off: Oh if we could wait on &amp; be faithfull! The good will of him who dwelt in the bush, the tender favour &amp; love, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Help me with your pravers, &amp; desire from me, other brethren to take courage for their Master.</p>

foot within the march of eternity &amp; all your good things of this short night-dream shall seem to you like the ashes of a bleaze of thorns or straw, &amp; your poor soul shall be crying, <hi>Lodging, lodging, for God's sake:</hi> Then shall your soul be more glad at one of your Lord's lovely &amp; homely smiles; then if ye had the charters of three worlds for all eternity. Let pleasures &amp; gain, will &amp; desires of this world be put over in God's hands, as arrested and fenced goods that ye cannot intromet with: Now when ye are drinking the ground of your cup &amp; ye are upon the utmost ends of the last link of time, &amp; old age like death's long shadow is casting a covering upon your days, it is no time to court this vain life, &amp; to set love &amp; heart upon it: It is near after supper, seek rest &amp; ease for your soul in God through Christ: Beleeve me I finde it hard wrestling to play fair with Christ &amp; to keep good quarters with him, &amp; keep love to him in integrity &amp; life, &amp; to keep a constant course of sound &amp; solid daily communion with Christ: temptatations are daily break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the threed of that course, &amp; it is not easie to cast a knot again, &amp; many knots make evil work. O how fair have many ships been plying before the wind, that in an hour's space have been lying in the sea bottom! How many professours cast a golden lustre, as if they were pure gold, &amp; yet are under that skin &amp; cover but base &amp; reprobate mettall! And how many keep breath in their race many miles, &amp; yet come short of the prize &amp; the garland! <hi>Dear Sir,</hi> my soul would mourn in secret for you, if I knew your case with God to be but false work: Love to have you anchored upon Christ maketh me fear your tottering &amp; slips: False under-water not seen in the ground of an enlightned conscience, is dangerous; so is often failing &amp; sinning against light: Know this, that these who never had sick nights nor days in conscience for sin, cannot have but such a peace with God, as will undercot &amp; break the flesh again and end in a sad war at death. O how fearfully are thousands beguiled with false hide growen over old sins, as if the soul were cured and healed! <hi>Dear Sir,</hi> I saw ever nature mighty, lofty, heady &amp; strong in you, &amp; it was more for you to be mortified &amp; dead to the world then another common man: Ye

It is violence to corrupt nature for a man to be holy, to lie down under Christ's feet, to quite will, pleasure, wordly love, earthly hope &amp; an itching of heart af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this fairded &amp; overguilded world, &amp; to be content that Christ trample upon all. Come in, come in to Christ and see what ye want &amp; finde it in him: He is the short cut [as we use to say] and the nearest way to an outgate of all your bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens: I dare avouch ye shall be dearly welcome to him, my soul would be glad to take part of the joy ye should have in him. I daresay, Angels pens, Angels tongues, nay as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worlds of Angels as there are drops of water in all the seas &amp; fountains and rivers of the earth, cannot paint him out to you: I think his sweetness since I was a prisoner hath swelled upon me to the greatness of two heavens: O for a soul as wide as the outmost circle of the highest heaven that containeth all, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his love! And yet I could hold little of it. O world's wonder! O if my soul might but lie within the smell of his love, suppose I could get no more but the smell of it! O but it is long to that day when I shall have a free world of Christ's love! O what a sight to be up in heaven in that fair orchard of the new Paradise, &amp; to see and smell and touch and kiss that fair field-flower, that ever green tree of life! His bare sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow were enough for me, a sight of him would be the earnest of heaven to me: Fy, sy upon us, that we have love lying rusting beside us, or which is worse, wasted away upon loathsom ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, &amp; Christ should lie his alone. Woe, woe is me, that Sin hath made so many mad men, seeking the fool's Paradise,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:57570:165"/>
fire under ice, &amp; some good and desireable thing without, and apart from Christ: Christ, Christ, nothing but Christ can cool our love's burning languor: O thirsty love, wilt thou set Christ the well of life to thy head &amp; drink thy fill; drink and spare not, drink love &amp; be drunken with Christ: Nay alas, the distance betwixt us and Christ is a death: O if we were clasped in other's arms! We should never twin again except heaven twinned and sundered us, &amp; that cannot be. I desire your children to seek this Lord: Desire them from me to be requested for Christ's sake to be blessed &amp; happy, and come &amp; take Christ &amp; all things with him: Let them beware of glassy &amp; slippery youth, of foolish young motions, of worldly lusts, of deceivable gain, of wicked company, of cursing, lying, blaspheming and foolish talking: Let them be filled with the Spirit, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint themselves with daily praying, &amp; with the store-house of wisdom and comfort, the good word of God. Help the souls of the poor people: O that my Lord would bring me again among them, that I might tell uncouth &amp; great tales of Christ to them! Receive not a stranger to preach any other doctrine to them. Pray for me his prisoner of hope, I pray for you without ceasing: I write my blessing, earnest prayers, the love of God &amp; the sweet presence of Christ to you and yours and them. Grace, grace, grace be with you.</p>

wink, &amp; in the dark reach your hand to Christ &amp; follow him. Let not mens fainting discourage you, neither be afraid of mens canny wisdom, who in this storm take the nearest shore &amp; goe to the lee &amp; calm side of the Gospel, &amp; hide Christ [if ever they had him] in their cabinets, as if they were ashamed of him, or as if Christ were stoln wares &amp; would blush before the sun. <hi>My very dear &amp; noble Lord,</hi> ye have rejoyced the hearts of many, that ye have made choice of Christ &amp; his Gospel, whereas such great temptations doe stand in your way: But I love your profession the better that it endureth winds: If we knew our selves well, to want temptations is the greatest temptation of all: Neither is father nor mother, nor court, nor ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, in this overlustred world with all it's paintry &amp; fairding any thing else, when they are laid in the ballance with Christ; but feathers, shadows, night-dreams &amp; straws. O if this world knew the excellency, sweetness &amp; beauty of that high &amp; lofty one, that fairest among the sons of men! verily they should see, if their love were bigger then ten heavens, all in circles without other, that it were all too little for Christ our Lord. I hope your choice shall not repent you, when life shall come to that twilight betwixt Time &amp; Eternity, and ye shall see the utmost border of Time &amp; shall draw the curtain &amp; look in to Eternity, &amp; shall one day see God take the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens in his hands &amp; fold them together like an old holly gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; set on fire this clay-part of the creation of God, &amp; consume away in smoke &amp; ashes the idol-hopes of poor fools, who think there is not a better countrey then this low coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of dying clay. Children can not make comparison aright betwixt this life and that to come; &amp; therefore the babes of this world who see no better, mould in their own brain a heaven of their own coyning, because they see no further then the nearest side of Time. I dare lay in pawne my hope of heaven that this reproached way, is the onely way of peace: I finde it is the way that the Lord hath sealed with his comforts now in my bonds for Christ: &amp; I verily esteem &amp; finde chains &amp; fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for that lovely one Christ, to be watered over with sweet consolations &amp; the love-smiles of that lovely Bridegroom, for

I have a dwining, sickly and pained life for a reall possession of him, and am troubled with love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brashes and love-fevers, but it is a sweet pain: I would refuse no conditions, not hell excepted [reserving alwayes God's ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred] to buy possession of Jesus; but alas I am not a merchant who have any money to give for him, I must either come to a good cheap market where wares are had for nothing, else I goe home empty: But I have casten this work upon Christ to get me himself: I have his faith &amp; truth &amp; promise [as a pawne of his] all engaged, that I shall obtain that which my hungry desires would be at, &amp; I esteem that the choice of my happiness: And for Christ's cross, especially the garland &amp; the flower of all crosses, <hi>to suffer for his name,</hi> I esteem it more then I can write or speak to you: And I write it under mine own hand to you, it is one of the steps of the ladder up to our countrey, &amp; Christ [who ever be one] is still at the heavy end of this black tree, &amp; so it is but as a feather to me: I need not run at leisure because of a burthen on my back, my back never bare the like of it, the more heavily crossed for Christ, the soul is still the lighter for the journey. Now would to God, all cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blooded, faint-hearted souldiers of Christ, would look again to Jesus &amp; to his love, &amp; when they look, I would have them to look again &amp; again, &amp; fill themselves with beholding of Christ's beauty, &amp; I dare say then, that Christ should come in great court &amp; request with many: The virgins would flock fast about the Bridegroom, they would embrace and take hold of him &amp; not let him goe. But when I have spoken of him till my head rive, I have said just nothing, I may begin again: A God-head, a God-head is a world's wonder: Set ten thousand thousand new made worlds of angels and elect men, &amp; double them in number, ten thousand, thousand, thousand
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:57570:169"/>
times, let their heart &amp; tongues be ten thousand, thousand times more agile &amp; large, then the heart &amp; tongues of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphims that stand with six wings before him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 6. 2. When they have said all for the glorifying &amp; praising of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, they have but spoken little or nothing: his love will bide all possible creatures to praise. Oh if I could wear this tongue to the stump in extolling his highness! but it is my daily grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sorrow, that I am confounded with his incomparable love, &amp; he doeth so great things for my soul, &amp; he got never yet any thing of me worth the speaking of. <hi>Sir,</hi> I charge you help me to praise him: It is a shame to speak of what he hath done for me &amp; what I doe to him again. I am sure, Christ hath many drowned Dyvours in heaven beside him, &amp; when we are conveened, man &amp; angel, at the great day in that fair last meeting, we are all but his drowned Dyvours: It is hard to say who oweth him most: If men could doe no more, I would have them to wonder: If we cannot be filled with Christ's love; we may be filled with wondering. <hi>Sir,</hi> I would I could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade you to grow sick for Christ &amp; to long after him, &amp; be pained with love for himself; but his tongue is in heaven, who can doe it! To him &amp; his rich grace I recommend you. I pray you, pray for me &amp; forget not to praise.</p>

If this land were humbled, I would look that our skie should clear &amp; our day dawn again, &amp; ye should then bless Christ who is content to save your travel, &amp; to give himself to you in pure ordinances on this side of the sea.

I am waiting on for enlargement, &amp; half content that my faith bow, if Christ while he bow it, keep it unbroken; for who goeth through a fire without a mark or a scald. I see the Lord making use of this fire to scour his vessels from their rust. Oh that my will were silent &amp; as a childe weaned from the breasts! Psal. 130. But alas, who hath a heart that will give Christ the last word in flyting, &amp; will hear &amp; not speak again? Oh contestations &amp; quarrelous replies [as a soon sadled spirit, <hi>I doe well to be angry, even to the death, Ion.</hi> 4: 9.] Smell of the stink of strong corruption!

I know not if my Lord will bring me to his sanctuary or not; but I know he hath the placing of me either within or without the house, &amp; that nothing will be done without him: But I am often thinking &amp; saying within my self, that my dayes flee away, and I see no good, neither yet Christ's work thriving; and it is like the grave shall prevent the ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of my desires of saving souls as I would: But alas I cannot

               <p>GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I have been too long in writing to you. I am confident ye have learned to prize Christ &amp; his love &amp; favour more then ordinary professours, who scarce see Christ with half an eye, because their sight is taken up with eying &amp; liking the beauty of this over-guileded world that promiseth fair to all it's lovers, but in the push of a trial when need is, can give nothing but a fair beguile. I know ye are not ignorant that men come not to this world as some doe to a market, to see and be seen, or as some come to behold a May-game, and onely to behold and to goe home again: Ye came hither to treat with God &amp; to tryst with him in his Christ, for salvation to your soul, &amp; to seek recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilation with an angry and wrathful God in a covenant of peace made to you in Christ, &amp; this is more then an ordinary sport or the play that the greatest part of the world give their heart unto: And therefore, <hi>Worthy Sir,</hi> I pray you by the salvation of your soul and by the mercy of God &amp; your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearence before Christ, doe this in sad earnest, &amp; let not salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be your by-work or your holy-day's task onely, or a work by the way: For men think that this may be done in three dayes space on a feather-bed, when death &amp; they are fallen in hands together, and that with a word or two they shall make their soul-matters right: Alas, this is to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

be that heavenly wise as to divorce from &amp; free their soul of all Idol-lovers, and make Christ the onely onely One, and trim &amp; make ready their lamps while they have time and day! How soon will this house skail and the Innes where the poor soul lodgeth fall to the earth! How soon will some few years pass away, &amp; then when the day is ended &amp; this life's lease expired, what have men of world's glory, but dreams &amp; thoughts? O how bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a thing is it to labour for Christ &amp; to make him sure! Know and try in time your holding of him and the rights and charters of heaven, and upon what terms ye have Christ and the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and what Christ is worth in your estimation, and how lightly ye esteem of other things and how dearly of Christ! I am sure if ye see him in his beauty and glory, ye shall see him to be all things, and that incomparable jewel of gold that ye should seek, howbeit ye should sell, wod-set &amp; forfeit your few years portion of this life's joyes. O happy soul for evermore who can rightly compare this life with that long-lasting life to come, &amp; can ballance the weighty glory of the one, with the light gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en vanity of the other! The day of the Lord is now near hand, &amp; all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shall come out in their black's &amp; white's as they are: There shall be no borrowed lying colours in that day, when Christ shall be called Christ &amp; no longer nicknamed: now men borrow Christ &amp; his white colour &amp; the lustre &amp; fairding of Christianity; but how many counterfeit masks will be burnt in the day of God, in the fire, that shall burn the earth &amp; the works that are in it: And howbeit Christ have the hardest part of it now, yet in the presence of my Lord whom I serve in the spirit, I would not niffer or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change Christ's prison, bands &amp; chains, with the gold chains &amp; Lordly rents, &amp; smiling &amp; happy-like heavens of the men of this world. I am far from thoughts of repenting because of my losses &amp; bonds for Christ, I wish all my adversaries were as I am except my bonds. Worthy, worthy, worthy for evermore is Christ, for whom we should suffer pains like hell's pains, far more the short hell that the saints of God have in this life. <hi>Sir,</hi> I wish your soul may be more acquainted with the sweetness of Christ.

I cannot set heavens above heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens till I were tired with numbering, &amp; set him upon the highest step &amp; story of the highest of them all: But I wish I could make him great through the world, suppose my loss &amp; pain &amp; shame were set under the soles of his feet, that he might stand upon me. I request you faint not because this world &amp; ye are at <hi>yea</hi> &amp; <hi>nay,</hi> &amp; because this is not a home that laugheth upon you, The wise Lord who knoweth you will have it so, because he casteth a net for your love to catch it &amp; gather it in to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; therefore bear patiently the loss of children and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens and other discontentments either within or without the house: Your Lord in them is seeking you, and seek ye him: Let none be your love &amp; choice, &amp; the flower of your delights but your Lord Jesus: Set not your heart upon the world, since God hath not made it your portion; for it will not fall you to get two portions, and to laugh twice, and to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py twice, and to have an upper-heaven and an under-heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en too: Christ our Lord &amp; his saints were not so; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

let goe your grip of this life &amp; of the good things of it: I hope your heaven groweth not hereaway: Learn daily both to possess &amp; miss Christ in his secret bridegroom-smiles: He must goe &amp; come because his infinite wisdom thinketh it best for you: we will be together one day: We shall not need to borrow light from sun, moon or candle: There shall be no complaints on eiher side in heaven: There shall be none there but He &amp; we, the bridegroom &amp; the bride; Devils, temptations, trials, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions, losses, sad hearts, pain &amp; death shall all be put out of play, &amp; the Devil must give up his office of <hi>Tempting:</hi> O blessed is the soul whose hope hath a face looking straight out to that day! It is not our part to make a treasure here: Any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the covering of heaven we can build upon, is but ill ground, &amp; a sandy foundation: Every good thing except God wanteth a bottom, &amp; cannot stand it's alone; how then can it bear the weight of us? Let us not lay a load upon a windlestraw, there shall nothing finde my weight or found my happiness, but God: I know all created power should sink under me, if I should lean down upon it; &amp; therfore it is better to rest on God then sink or fall: &amp; we weak souls must have a bottom &amp; being-place; for we cannot stand our alone: let us then be wise in our choice, &amp; chuse &amp; waile our own blessedness, which is to trust in the Lord: Each one of us hath a whore &amp; idol besides our husbend <hi>Christ:</hi> But it is our folly to divide our narrow &amp; little love: It will not serve two, best then hold it whole &amp; together, &amp; give it to Christ; for then we get double interest for our love, when we lend it to, &amp; lay it out upon Christ, &amp; we are sure besides, that the stock cannot perish. Now, I can say no more, remember me: I have God's right to that people; howbeit by the violence of men, stronger then I, I am banished from you &amp; chased away: The Lord give you mercy in the day of Christ: It may be God clear my sky again; howbeit there is small appearance of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance: But let him doe with me what seemeth good in his own eyes: I am his clay, let my porter frame &amp; fashion me as he pleaseth.

               <p>GRace, mercy &amp; peace be to you: I have been too long I confess in writing to you. My sute now to you in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per [since I have no access to speak to you as formerly] is, that ye would lay the foundation sure in your youth: When ye begin to seek Christ, try I pray you upon what terms ye co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to follow him, and lay your accounts what it may cost you; that summer nor winter, nor well nor woe, may not, cause you change your master, Christ: Keep fair to him &amp; be honest and faithfull that he finde not a crack in you. Surely ye are now in the throng of temptations: When youth is come to it's fairest bloom, then the Devil &amp; the lusts of a deceiving world &amp; sin are upon horse-back and follow with up sails: If this were not, <hi>Paul</hi> needed not to have written to a sanctified &amp; holy youth <hi>Timothy</hi> [a faithfull preacher of the Gospel] <hi>flee the lusts of youth.</hi> Give Christ your virgin-love, ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not put your love &amp; heart in a better hand. O if ye knew him &amp; saw his beauty! Your love, your liking, your heart, your desires would close with him &amp; cleave to him. Love by nature when it seeth, cannot but cast out it's spirit and strength upon amiable objects &amp; good things &amp; things love-worthy: and what fairer thing then Christ? O fair sun and fair moon and fair stars, and fair flowers and fair roses and fair lilies, and fair creatures; but O ten thousand thousand times fairer Lord
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:57570:179"/>
Jesus! Alas, I wronged him in making the comparison this way! O black sun &amp; moon, but O fair Lord Jesus! O black flowers &amp; black lilies &amp; roses, but O fair, fair, ever fair Lord Jesus! O all fair things, black &amp; deformed without beauty, when ye are beside that fairest Lord Jesus! O black heaven, but O fair Christ! O black Angels, but O surpassingly fair Lord Jesus! I would seek no more to make me happy for evermore, but a through &amp; clear sight of the beauty of Jesus my Lord: Let my eyes enjoy his fairness &amp; store him for ever in the face, &amp; I have all that can be wished. Get Christ rather then gold or silver, seek Christ howbeit ye should lose all things for him: They take their marks by the moon &amp; look asquint in looking to fair Christ, who resolve for the world &amp; their ease, &amp; for their honour &amp; court &amp; credit, or for fear of losses &amp; a sore skin that they will turn their back upon Christ &amp; his truth. Alas, how many blinde eyes &amp; squint-lookers look this day in <hi>Scotland</hi> upon Christ's beauty, &amp; they see a spot in Christ's fair face! Alas, they are not worthy of Christ who look this way upon him, &amp; see no beauty in him why they should desire him! God send me my fill of his beauty, if it be possible that my soul can be full of his beauty here: But much of Christ's beauty needeth not abate the eag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er appetite of a soul [sick of love for himself] to see him in the other world, where he is seen as he is. I am glad with all my heart that ye have given your greenest morning age to this Lord Jesus: Hold on &amp; weary not, faint not, resolve upon suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Christ, but fear not ten dayes tribulation, for Christ's sowre cross is sugared with comforts &amp; hath a taste of Christ himself. I esteem it my glory, my joy &amp; my crown, &amp; I bless him for this honour, to be yoked with Christ &amp; married with him in suffering, who therefore was born &amp; therefore came into the world that he might bear witness to the truth. Take pains above all things for salvation, for without running, fighting, sweating, wrestling, heaven is not taken. O happy soul, that crosseth nature's stomack, &amp; delighteth to gain that fair garland &amp; crown of glory! What a feckless loss is it for you to goe through this wilderness &amp; never taste of sin's sugared plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures! What poorer is a soul to want pride, lust, love of

the world &amp; the vanities of this vain &amp; worthless world! Nature hath no cause to weep at the want of such toyes as these. Esteem it your gain to be an heir of glory, O but that is an eye-look to a fair rent! The very hope of heaven under troubles, is like wind &amp; sails to the soul, &amp; like wings when the feet come out of the share. O for what stay we here! Up, up, after our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, this is not our rest nor our dwelling: What have we to doe in this prison, except onely to take meat &amp; house-room in it for a time?

It is my aim &amp; hearty desire that my furnace, which is of the Lord's kindling, may sparkle fire upon standers by, to the warming of their hearts with God's love. The very dust that falleth from Christ's feet, his old ragged clothes, his knotty &amp; black cross, is sweeter to me then Kings golden crowns &amp; their time-eaten plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures: I should be a liar &amp; false witness, if I should not give my Lord Jesus a fair testimonial with my whole soul: my word I know will not heighten him, he needeth not such props under his feet to raise his glory high: But Oh that I could raise him the height of heaven &amp; the breadth &amp; length often heavens in the estimation of all his young lovers! for we have all shapen Christ but too narrow &amp; too short, &amp; formed conceptions of his love in our conceit very unworthy of it. Oh that men were taken &amp; catched with his beauty &amp; fairness! They would give over playing with idols, in which there is not halfroom for the love of one soul to exspatiat itself, &amp; man's love is but heart-hungered
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:57570:180"/>
in gnawing upon bare bones &amp; sucking at dry breasts: It is well wared they want who will not come to him who hath a world of love &amp; goodness &amp; bounty for all. We seek to thawe our frozen hearts at the cold smoke of the short-timed creature, &amp; our souls gather neither heat nor life nor light, for these can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give to us what they have not in themselves. Oh that we could thrust in through these thorns &amp; this throng of bastard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovers, &amp; be ravished &amp; sick of love for Christ! We should sinde some footing &amp; some room &amp; sweet ease for our tottering &amp; wirless souls in our Lord. I wish it were in my power after this day, to cry down all love but the love of Christ, &amp; to cry down all Gods but Christ, all Saviours but Christ, all welbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loveds but Christ, &amp; all soul-suters, all love-beggers but Christ. Ye complain that ye want a mark of the sound work of grace &amp; love in your soul. For answer, consider for your satisfaction (till God send more) 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3: 14. And as for your complaint of Deadness &amp; Doubtings, Christ I hope will take your deadness &amp; you together: They are bodies full of holes, running boils, &amp; broken bones that need mending, that Christ the Physician taketh up: whole vessels are not for the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator Christ's art: Publicans, sinners, whores, harlots, are ready market-wares for Christ: The onely thing that will bring sinners within a cast of Christ's drawing arm, is, that which ye write of, some feeling of death &amp; Sin that bringeth forth complaints: &amp; therefore out of sense complain more, &amp; be more acquaint with all the cramps, stitches &amp; soul-swoonings that trouble you: The more pain &amp; the more night-watching &amp; the moe fevers, the better: A soul bleeding to death till Christ were sent for &amp; cried for in all haste to come &amp; stem the blood &amp; close up the hole in the wound, with his own hand &amp; balm, were a very good disease when many are dying of a whole heart. We have all too little of hell-pain &amp; terrours that way: Nay, God send mesuch a hell as Christ hath promised to make a heaven out of. Alas, I am not come that far on in the way as to say in sad earnest, <hi>Lord Iesus, great &amp; soveraign Physician, here is a pained patient for thee.</hi> But the thing that we mistake, is <hi>the want of victory,</hi> we hold that to be the mark of one that hath no grace:
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:57570:180"/>
Nay, I say, <hi>the want of fighting</hi> were a mark of no grace, but I shall not say, <hi>the want of victory</hi> is such a mark. If my fire &amp; the Devil's water make crackling like thunder in the air, I am the less feared; for where there is fire, it is Christ's part that I lay &amp; binde upon him to keep in the coal, and to pray the father that my faith fail not, if I in the mean time be wrestling &amp; doing and sighing and mourning: For prayer putteth not <hi>Paul's</hi> devil [the prick in the flesh &amp; the messenger of Satan] to the door at first, but our Lord will have them trying every one another and let <hi>Paul</hi> send himself by God's help, God keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the stakes &amp; moderating the play: And ye doe well not to doubt if the ground-stone be sure, but to try if it be so, for there is great ods between <hi>doubting</hi> that we have grace &amp; <hi>try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> if we have grace: the former may be sin, but the latter is good. We are but loose in trying our free-holding of Christ &amp; making sure work of Christ: Holy fear is a searching the camp that there be no enemy within our bosom to betray us, &amp; a seeing that all be fast &amp; sure: For I see many lecking vessels fair before the wind, &amp; professours who take their conversion upon trust, &amp; they goe on securely &amp; see not to the under-water till a storm sink them: Each man had need twice a day &amp; oftner, to be ryped &amp; searched with candles. pray for me that the Lord would give me house-room again to hold a candle to this dark world.

And verily I see no object in heaven or in earth that I could ware this much of love upon that I have, but upon Christ. Alas that clay and time and shadows run away with our love, which is ill spent upon any but upon Christ: each fool at the day of judgement shall seek back his love from the creatures, when he shall see them all in a fair fire, but they shall prove irresponsall debters: And therefore best here look ere we leap, and look ere we love. I finde now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his cross that I would fain give him more then I have to give him, if giving were in my power: But I rather wish him my heart then give him it, except he take it and put himself in possession of it [for I hope he hath a market-right to me, since he hath ransomed me] I see not how Christ can have me. O that he would be pleased to be more home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with my soul's love, and to come in to my soul and take his own! But when he goeth away &amp; hideth himself, all is to me that I had of Christ, as if it had fallen in the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bottom.

Acquaint your self with Christ's love &amp; ye shall not miss to finde new golde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mines &amp; treasures in Christ: Nay truly, we but stand beside Christ, we goe not <hi>in</hi> to him to take our fill of him. But if he should doe two things, 1. Draw the curtains &amp; make bare his holy face, &amp; then 2. Clear our dim &amp; bleared eyes to see his beauty &amp; glory, he should finde many lovers. I would seek no more happiness but a sight of him so near hand as to see, hear, smell, &amp; touch &amp; embrace him: But oh, closed doors &amp; vails &amp; curtains &amp; thick clouds hold me in pain while I finde the sweet burning of his love that many waters cannot quench! O what sad hours have I when I think, that love of Christ scarreth at me &amp; bloweth by me! If my Lord Jesus would come to bargaining for his love, I think he should make price himself, I should not refuse ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand years in hell, to have a wide soul enlarged &amp; made wider, that I might be exceedingly [even to the running over] filled with his love. O what am I to love such an one, or to be loved by that high &amp; lofty One! I think the Angels may blush to look upon him, &amp; what am I to file such infinite brightness with my sinfull eyes? O that Christ would come near &amp; stand still &amp; give me leave to look upon him!

a long time out of thy glorious presence is two deaths &amp; two hells to me; We must meet, I must see him, I dow not want him: hunger &amp; longing for Christ hath brought on such a necessity of enjoying Christ, that cost me what it will, I cannot but assure Christ, I will not, I dow not want him: For I cannot master or command Christ's love: nay, hell [as I now think] &amp; all the pains in it laid on me alone, would not put me from loving: Yea, suppose my Lord Jesus would not love me, it is above my strength or power to keep back or imprison the weak love I have, but it must be out to Christ: I would set heaven's joy aside, &amp; live upon Christ's love it's alone: Let me have no joy but the warmness &amp; fire of God's love, I seek no other: God knoweth, if this love be taken from me, the bottom is fallen out of all my happiness &amp; joy; &amp; therefore I beleeve, Christ will never doe me that, as to bereave a poor pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner of his love, it were cruelty to take it from me, &amp; he who is kindness it self cannot be cruel. <hi>Dear Brother,</hi> weary not of my sweet Master's chains, we are so much the sibber to Christ that we suffer: Lodge not a hard thought of my royal King: rejoyce in his cross: Your deliverance sleepeth not, he that will come is not slack of his promise: Wait on for God's time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous salvation, ask not when or How long?

We say we are removing and going from this world; but our heart stirreth not one foot off it's seat. Alas I see few heavenly minded souls that have nothing upon the earth, but their body of clay going up and down this earth, because their soul &amp; the powers of it are up in heaven, &amp; there, their hearts live, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, enjoy, rejoyce.

O how little doeth this world see of him, &amp; how far are they from the love of him, seeing there is so much loveliness, beauty and sweetness in Christ that no created eye did ever yet see!

And for my silence, I lay it before Christ, I hope it shall be a speaking silence: He who knoweth what I would, knoweth that my soul desireth no more, but that King Jesus may be great in the North of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the South and in the East &amp; West, through my sufferings for the freedom of my Lord's house and Kingdom. If I could keep good quarters in time to come with Christ, I would fear nothing: But Oh! Oh! I complain of my wofull out-breakings; I tremble at the remembrance of a new out-cast betwixt him and me, and I have cause, when I consider what sick &amp; sad dayes I have had for his absence who is now come. I finde Christ dow not be long unkinde, our <hi>Ioseph's</hi> bowels yern within him, he cannot smother love long, it must break out at length.

If I have not a stock to pre sent to Christ at his appearance, yet I pray God I may be able with joy, faith &amp; constancy, to shew the Captain of my savation in that day, a bloody head that I received in his service: howbeit my faith hang by a small tack &amp; threed, I hope the tack shall not break: &amp; howbeit my Lord get no service of me but broken wishes; yet I trust these shall be accepted upon Christ's account. I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to comfort me, but that I say, Oh will the Lod disappoint an hungry on-waiter? The smell of Christ's wine &amp; apples which surposse the uptaking of dull sense, bloweth upon my soul, &amp; I get no more for the mean time: I am sure to let a famish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing body see meat &amp; give him none of it, is a double pain: Our Lord's love it not so cruell as to let a poor man see Christ &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven &amp; never give him more, for want of money to buy; nay, I rather think Christ such fair market-wares, as buyers may have <hi>

That is the poor man's market. Now <hi>Brother</hi> I see old crosses would have done nothing at me, &amp; therefore Christ hath take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a new fresh rod to me, that seemeth to talk with my soul, &amp; make me tremble. I have often more adoe now with faith when I lose my compasse, &amp; am blowen on a rock, then these who are my beholders standing upon the shore are aware of: a counsel to a sick man is sooner given then taken: Lord send the wearied man a borrowed bed from Christ: I think often it is after supper with me, &amp; I am heavie: O but I would sleep soundly with Christ's left hand under my head &amp; his right hand embrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me: the devil could not spill that bed.

I would give Christ all his love stiles and titles of honour if he would give me but this; nay, I would sell my self (if I could) for that love. I have been waiting to see what friends of place &amp; power would doe for us; But when the Lord looseth the pins of his own Tabernacle, he will have himself to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged as the onely builder up thereof, &amp; therefore I would take back again my hope that I lent and laid in pawne in mens hands &amp; give it wholly to Christ: it is no time for me now to set up idols of my own, it were a pity to give an ounce weight of hope to any besides Christ: I think him well worthy or all my hope, though it were as weighty as both heaven &amp; earth: Happy were I, if I had any thing that Christ would seek or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of: But now alas I see not what service I can doe to him, except it to be talk a little &amp; bable upon a piece of paper, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the love of Christ.

I know he seeketh of us an out-cast with this house of clay, this mother-prison, this earth, that we love fall well: &amp; verily, when Christ snuffeth my candle &amp; causeth my light to shine upward, it is one of my greatest wonders that dirt &amp; clay hath so much court with a soul not made of clay, &amp; that our soul goeth out of kinde so far;

I see nothing in this life but sin &amp; the sowre fruits of sin: And O what a burden is sin; &amp; what a slavery &amp; miserable bondage is it, to be at the nod &amp; yea's &amp; nay's of such a lord-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster as a body of sin! Truly when I think of it, it is a wonder that Christ maketh not fire &amp; ashes of such a dry branch as I am. I would often lie down under Christ's feet, &amp; bid him trample upon me, when I consider my guiltiness: But seeing he hath sworn that sin shall not loose his unchangeable covenant, I keep house-room amongst the rest of the ill learned bairns, &amp; must cumber the Lord of the house with with the rest, till my Lord take the fetters off legs &amp; arms, &amp; destroy this body of sin, &amp; make a hole or a breach in this cage of earth, that the bird may flee out and the imprisoned soul be at liberty. In the mean time the least intimation of Christ's love is sweet, and the hope of marriage with the Bridegroom holdeth me in some joyfull on-waiting, that when Christ's summer-birds shall sing

upon the branches of the tree of life, I shall be tuned by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to help them to sing the home-coming of our welbeloved &amp; his Bride to their house together.

I exhort you &amp; beseech you in the bowels of Christ faint not, weary not: There is a great necessity of heaven, ye must needs have it: All other things, as houses, lands, children, husband, friends, countrey, credit, health, wealth, honour, may be wanted; but Heaven is your one thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, the good part that shall not be taken from you: See that ye buy the field where the pearl is, sell all &amp; make a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase of salvation: think it not easie, for it is a steep ascent to eternal glory: Many are lying dead by the way that are slain with security. I have now been led by my Lord Jesus to such a nick in Christianity as I think little of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer things. Oh what I want! I want so many things, that I am almost asking if I had any thing at all: Every man thinketh he is rich enough in grace, till he take out his purse &amp; tell his money, &amp; then he findeth his pack but poor &amp; light in the day of a heavy trial. I found I had not to bear my expences, and should have fainted if want &amp; penury had not chased me to the store-house of all. I beseech you, make couscience of your wayes, deal kindly &amp; with conscience with your Tenants: to fill a breach or a hole make not a greater breach in the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: I wish plenty of love to your soul: let the world be the portion of bastards, make it not yours: after the last trumpet is blowen, the world &amp; all its glory will be like an old house that is burnt to ashes, &amp; like an old fallen castle without a roof. Fy, fy upon us fools who think our selves debters to the world. My Lord hath brought me to this, that I would not give a drink of cold water for this world's kindness: I wonder that men long after, love, or care for these feathers: it is almost an uncouth world to me to think, that men are so mad as to block with dead earth: to give cut conscience &amp; to get in clay again, is a strange bargain. I have written my minde at length to your husband, write to me again his case, I cannot forget him in my prayers, I am looking Christ hath some claim to him: My counsel is, that ye bear with him when passion overtaketh him, <hi>A soft answer putteth away wrath,</hi> answer him in what he speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth &amp; apply your self in the fear of God to him, &amp; then ye will remove a pound weight of your heavy cross that way, &amp;

O what have I to say of that excellent, surpassing &amp; supereminent thing they call <hi>The Grace of God,</hi> the way of free redemption in Christ! And when poor poor I, dead in law, was sold, fettered &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned in Justice's closest ward, which is hell &amp; damnation;

when I a wretched one lighted upon <hi>noble Iesus, eternally kinde Iesus, tender hearted Iesus,</hi> nay, when he lighted upon me first &amp; knew me, I found that he scorned to take a price or any thing like hire of Angels, or Seraphims, or any of his creatures; and therefore I would praise him for this, that the whole armie of the redeemed ones sit rent-free in heaven: Our <hi>holding</hi> is better then <hi>Blench:</hi> We are all <hi>Free-holders,</hi> &amp; seeing our eternall <hi>feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duty</hi> is but thanks, Oh woefull me that I have but spilt thanks &amp; broken, lame &amp; miscarried praises to give him, &amp; so my silver is not good &amp; current with Christ, were it not that free merites have stamped it &amp; washen it &amp; me both! And for my silence, I see somewhat better through it now: If my high &amp; lofty one, my princely &amp; Royall Master say, <hi>Hold, hold thy peace, I lay bonds on thee thou speak none,</hi> I would fain be content, &amp; let my fire be smothered under ashes, without light or flame, I cannot help it, I take laws from my Lord, but I give none. As for your journey to F. ye doe well to follow it: The camp in Christ's ordinary bed: A carried bed is kindly to the Beloved down in this lower house: It may be, &amp; who knoweth but our Lord hath some Centurions ye are sent to: Seeing your angry mother denieth you lodging &amp; house-room with her, Christ's call to unknown faces must be your second wind, seeing ye cannot have a first. O that our Lord would water again with a new visite this piece withered &amp; dry hill of our widow-mount Zion! <hi>my Dear Brother,</hi> I will think it comfort if ye speak my name to our welbeloved: wherever ye are I am mindefull of you. O that the Lord would yet make the light of the moon in <hi>Scotland</hi> like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun seven fold brighter. For my self, as yet I have received no answer whither to goe: I wait on: O that Jesus had my love!

I perswade my soul that this is the way to heaven, &amp; his own Truth, I now suffer for: I exhort you in the name of Christ to continue in the truth which I delivered to you: Make Christ sure to your soul; for your day draweth nigh to an end: Many slide back now, who seemed to be Christ's friends, &amp; prove dishonest to him: But be ye faithfull to the death, &amp; ye shall have the crown of life: This span-length of your dayes, whereof the Spirit of God speaketh, Psal. 39. will within a short time, come to a finger-breadth &amp; at length to nothing: O how sweet &amp; comfortable shall the feast of a good conscience be to you, when your eye-strings shall break, your face wax pale, &amp; the breath turn cold, &amp; your poor soul come sighing to the windows of the house of clay of your dying body, &amp; shall long to be out, &amp; to have the jaylor to open the door, that the prisoner may be set at liberty: Ye draw nigh the water-side, look your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts: Ask for your guide to take you to the other side: Let not the world be your portion; What have ye to doe with dead clay?

and see your lodging: Look through all your father's rooms in heaven, in your father's house are many dwelling-places: Men take a sight of lands ere they buy them: I know Christ hath made the bargain already: But be kinde to the house ye are going to, &amp; see it often: Set your heart on things that are above, where Christ is, at the right hand of God: Stir up your husband to minde his own countrey at home: Counsel him to deal mercifully with the poor people of God under him: They are Christ's &amp; not his; therefore desire him to shew them mercifull dealing &amp; kindness, &amp; to be good to their souls. I desire you to write to me: It may be that my Parish forget me; but my witness is in heaven I dow, not, I doe not forget them: They'are my sighes in the night &amp; my tears in the day: I think my self like an husband plucked from the wife of his youth: O Lord be my Judge what joy it would be to my soul to hear, that my ministery hath left the Son of God among them, &amp; that they are walking in Christ! Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber my love to your Son and Daughtre: Desire them from me to seek the Lord in their youth, and to give him the morning of their dayes: Acquaint them with the word of God &amp; prayer.

Let no man doubt but the state of our question we are now forced to stand to by suffering exile &amp; imprisonment, is, <hi>If Iesus should reign over his Kirk or not?</hi>
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:57570:202"/>
Oh if my sinfull arm could hold the crown on his head, howbeit it should be striken off from the shoulder-blade. For your ensuing &amp; feared trial, <hi>my very dearest in our Lord Iesus,</hi> Alas what am I to speak, to comfort a souldier of Christ, who hath done an hundred times more for that worthy &amp; honourable cause then I can doe? But I know these whom the world was not worthy of, wandered up &amp; down in deserts &amp; in mountains &amp; in dens &amp; caves of the earth, &amp; that while there is one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of mystical Christ out of heaven, that member must suffer strokes till our Lord Jesus draw in that member within the gates of the new <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which he will not fail to doe at last; for not one toe or finger of that body but it shall be take in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the city. What can be our part in this pitched battel betwixt the Lamb &amp; the Dragon? But to receive the darts in patience, that rebound off us on upon our sweet Master, or rather light first upon him &amp; then rebound off him upon his servants. I think it a sweet North-wind that bloweth first upon the fair face of the chief among ten thousand &amp; then lighteth upon our sinfull &amp; black faces: When once the wind bloweth off him upon me, I think it hath a sweet smell of Christ, &amp; so must besome more then a single cross. I know ye have a guard about you, &amp; your attendance &amp; train for your safety, is far beyond your pursuers force or fraud: It is good under feud to be near our war-house &amp; strong hold: We can doe but little to resist them who persecut us &amp; oppose him, but keep our blood &amp; our wounds to the next Court-day, when our complaints will be read: If this day be not Christ's, I am sure the morrow shall be his. As for any thing I doe in my bonds when now &amp; then a word falleth from me, alas it is very little! I am exceedingly grieved that any should conceive any thing to be in such a broken, &amp; emptie reed, let no man impute it to me that the free &amp; unbought wind [for I gave nothing for it] bloweth upon an empty reed: I am his overburdened debter. I cry down with <hi>me,</hi> down, down with all the excellency of the world, &amp; up, up with Christ: Long, long may that fair One, that holy One be on high: My curse be upon them that love him not. O how glad would I be if his glory would grow out &amp; spring up out of my bonds
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:57570:202"/>
&amp; sufferings! Certainly since I became his prisoner, he hath won the yolk &amp; heart of my soul: Christ is even become a new Christ to me &amp; his love greener then it was, &amp; now I strive no more with him, his love shall carry it away: I lay down my self under his love, I desire to sing &amp; to cry &amp; to proclaim my self even under the water, in his common, &amp; eternally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to his kindness: I will not offer to quite commons with him [as we use to say] for that will not be: All, all for evermore be Christ's. What further trials are before me I know not, but I know Christ will have a saved soul of me, over on the other side of the water, in the yonder side of crosses &amp; beyond mens wrongs. I had but one eye &amp; that they have put out: My one joy, next to the flower of my joyes, <hi>Christ,</hi> was to preach my sweetest, sweetest Master and the glory of his Kingdom, and it seemed no cruelty to them to put out the poor man's one eye. And now I am seeking about to see if <hi>suffering</hi> will speak my fair One's praises, &amp; I am trying if a dumb man's tongue can raise one note or one of Zion's springs to advance my Welbeloved's glory: Oh if he would make some glory to himself out of a dumb prisoner! I goe with childe of his word, I cannot be delivered, none here will have my Master, Alas! What aileth them at him? I bless you for your prayers, adde to them praises: As I am able I pay you home. I commend your diving in Christ's Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I would I could set out the dead man's goodwill to his friends in his sweet Testament: Speak a prisoner's hearty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations to Christ: fear not, your ten dayes will over. These that are gathered against mount <hi>Zion,</hi> their eyes shall melt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in their eye-holes and their tongues consume away in their mouthes, &amp; Christ's withered garden shall grow green again in <hi>Scotland:</hi> My Lord Jesus hath a word hid in heaven for <hi>Scotland,</hi> not yet brought out.

Oh that he would give me more then paper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace or tongue-grace! Were it not that want paineth me, I should have skailed house &amp; gone a begging long since, but Christ hath left me with some hunger that is more hot then wise, &amp; is ready often to say, <hi>If Christ longed for me as I doe for him, we should not be long in meeting, and if he loved my company aswell as I doe his, even while I am writing this letter to you, we should flee in other's arms:</hi> But I know there is more <hi>will</hi> then <hi>wit</hi> in this languor &amp; pining love for Christ, &amp; no marvel; for Christ's love would have hot harvest long ere mid-summer: But if I have any love to him, Christ hath both love to me &amp; wit to guide his love: &amp; I see, the best thing I have, hath as much dross beside it, as might curse me &amp; it both; &amp; if it were for no more, we have need of a Saviour to pardon the very faults and diseases &amp; weakness of the new man, &amp; to take away [to say so] our godly sins, or the sins of our sanctification &amp; the dross &amp; scum of spiritual love: woe, woe is me! O what need is there then of Christ's calling to scour &amp; cleanse &amp; wash away an ugly old body of sin, the very image of Satan!

Were my blackness &amp; Christ's beauty carded through other [as we use to speak] his beauty &amp; holiness would eat up my filthiness: But Oh I have not casten old <hi>Adam's</hi> hew &amp; colour yet! I trow the best of us hath a smell yet of the old loathsom body of sin &amp; guiltiness: Happy are they for evermore who can employ Christ &amp; set his blood &amp; death on work, to make clean work to God, of foul souls: I know, it is our sin, that we would have sanctification on the sunny side of the the hill, &amp; holiness with nothing but summer, &amp; no crosses at all: Sin hath made us as tender as if were made of paper or glass. I am often thinking what I would think of Christ &amp; burning quick together, of Christ &amp; tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing &amp; hot melted lead poured in at mouth &amp; navel: yet I have some weak experience [but very weak indeed] that suppose Christ &amp; hell's torments were married together &amp; if there were no finding of Christ at all, except I went to hell's furnace, that there &amp; in no other place I could meet with him, I trow, if I were as I have been since I was his prisoner, I would beglodging for God's sake in hell, hottest furnace, that I might rub souls with Christ: But God be thanked I shall finde him in a better lodging: We get Christ better cheap then so, when he is rouped to us, we get him but with a shower of summer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troubles in this life, as sweet &amp; as soft to beleevers as a May-dew. I would have you &amp; my self helping Christ mystical to weep for his wife, &amp; O thatf we could mourn for Christ buried in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> &amp; for his two slain witnesses killed, because they prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied! If we could so importune &amp; solicit God, our buried Lord &amp; his two buried witnesses should rise again: Earth &amp; clay and stone will nto bear down Christ &amp; the Gospel in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> I know not if I will see the second temple &amp; the glory of it; but the Lord hath deceived me if it be not to be reared up again: I would wish to give Christ his <hi>welcome-home</hi> again: My blessing, my joy, my glory &amp; love be on the home-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.

O how worthy is Christ of my feckless &amp; light suffering, &amp; how hath he deserved it at my hands, that for his honour &amp; glory I should lay my back under seven hells pain in one, if he call me to that! but alas my soul is like a ship run on ground through ebbeness of water: I am sanded, and and my love is sanded: I finde not how to bring it on float again, it is so cold and dead that I see not how to bring it to a flame: Fy, fy upon the meeting that my love hath given Christ: woe, woe is me, I have a lover <hi>Christ,</hi> &amp; yet I want love for him: I have a lovely &amp; desirable Lord who is love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, &amp; who beggeth my love &amp; heart &amp; I have nothing to give him. <hi>Dear Brother,</hi> come further in on Christ &amp; see a new treasure in him: come in &amp; look down &amp; see Angels won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, &amp; heaven &amp; earth's wonder of love, sweetness, majesty &amp; excellency in him.

My dear Brother, search your self with the candle of God, &amp; try if the life of God &amp; Christ be in you: Salvation is not casten to every man's door: Many are carried over see &amp; land to a far countrey in a ship, whileas they sleep much of all the way: but men are not landed at heaven sleeping: The righteous are scarcily saved, and many run as fast as either ye or I, who miss the prize and the crown: God send me salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and save me from a disappointment, and I seek no more: Men think it but a stryde or a step over to heaven, but when so few are saved, even of a mumber like the sand of the sea, but a handfull &amp; a remnant (as God's word saith) what cause have we to shake our selves out of our selves &amp; to ask our poor soul, <hi>whether goest thou? where shalt thou lodge at night?

               <p>GRace, mercy &amp; peace be to you: So often as I think on our case in our souldiers night-watch, &amp; of our sighting life in the fields, while we are here: I am forced to say, prisoners in a dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon condemned by a judge, to want the light of the sun and moon &amp; candle, till their dying day, are no more, nay not so much to be pitied as we are; for they weary of their life, they hate their prison: But we fall to in our prison, where we see little, to drink our selves drunk with the night-pleasures of our weak dreams, &amp; we long for no better life then this; but at the blast of the last trumpet, &amp; the shout of the Archangel, when God shall take down the shepherd's tent of this fading world, we shall not have somuch as a drink of water of all the dreams that we now build on. Alas that the sharp &amp; bitter blasts on face &amp; sides which meet us in this life, have not learned us mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, &amp; made us dead to this world! We buy our own sorrow, &amp; we pay dear for it, when we spend out our love, our joy, our desires, our confidence upon an handfull of snow &amp; ice that time will melt away to nothing, &amp; go thirstie out of the drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Innes when all is done: Alas that we enquire not for the clear fountain; but are so foolish as to drink foul muddy &amp; rotten wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters even till our bed-time; &amp; then in the resurrection when we shall be awakned, our yesternight's sowre drinke &amp; swinish dregs shall <hi>rift</hi> up upon us, and sick, sick shall many a soul be then: I know no wholesom fountain but one: I know not a thing worth the buying but heaven: And my own minde is, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison were made betwixt Christ &amp; heaven, I would sell heaven with my blessing &amp; buy Christ. Oh if I could raise the market for Christ, &amp; heighten the market a pound for a penny, &amp; cry up Christ in mens estimation ten thousand talents more then

But they are shaping him &amp; crying him down &amp; valuing him at their unworthy <hi>half-penny,</hi> or else ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing &amp; bartering Christ with the miserable old fallen house of this vain world, or then they lend him out upon interest &amp; play the usurers with Christ: Because they profess him &amp; give out before men that Christ is their treasure &amp; stock, &amp; in the mean time, praise of men, &amp; a name, &amp; case, &amp; the summ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-sun of the Gospel is the usury they would be at, so when the trial cometh, they quite the stock for the interest &amp; loose all: Happy are they who can keep Christ by himself alone, and keep him clean and whole till God come &amp; count with them. I know in your hard and heavy trials long since, ye thought well and highly of Christ; but truly no cross should be old to us: We should not forget them, because years are come betwixt us and them, &amp; cast them by hand as we doe old clothes: We may make a cross old in <hi>time,</hi> new in <hi>use,</hi> &amp; as fruitfull as in the beginning of it: God is where and what he was seven years agoe, what ever change be in us: I speak not this, as if I thought ye had forgotten what God did to have your love long since; but that ye may awake your self in this sleepy age, &amp; remember fruitfully of Christ's first wooing and suiting of your love both with fire &amp; water, &amp; try if he got his answer, or if ye be yet to give him it: For I finde in my self that water run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not faster through a sieve, then our warnings slip from us; for I have lost &amp; casten by hands many summonds the Lord sent to me, &amp; therefore the Lord hath given me double charges, that I trust in God shall not rive me. I bless his great name who is no niggard in holding in crosses upon me, but spendeth largely his rods, that he may save me from this perishing world: how plentifull God is in means of this kinde is esteemed by many, one of God's unkinde mercies; but Christ's cross is neither a cruel nor unkinde mercy, but the love-token of a father. I am sure a lover chasing us for our well &amp; to have our love, should not be run away from or fled. God send me no worse mercy then the sanctified cross of Christ portendeth, &amp; I am sure I should be happy &amp; blest. Pray for me that I may finde house-room in

I have reasoned with your son at large, I rejoyce to see him set his face in the right airth, now when the Nobles love the sunny side of the Gospel best, and are afraid that Christ want souldiers and shall not be able to doe for himself. <hi>Madam,</hi> our debts of obligation to Christ are not small, the freedom of grace &amp; sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is the wonder of man and Angels, but mercy in our Lord scorneth hire: Ye are bound to lift Christ on high, who hath given you eyes to discern the Devil now coming out in in his white's, &amp; the Idolatry and Apostacy of the time well washen with fair pretences, but the skin is black &amp; the water foul: It were art, I confess, to wash a black Devil and make him white.

The supper will be great chear that is up in the great hall with the royal King of glory, when the four-hours, the standing drink in this driery wilderness is so sweet: When he bloweth a kiss a far off to his poor heart broken mourners in <hi>Zion,</hi> and sendeth me but his hearty commendations till we meet, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with wonder to think what it shall be, when the fairest among the sons of men shall lay a King's sweet soft cheek to the sinfull cheeks of poor sinners.

O time, time, goe swiftly &amp; hasten that day! Sweet Lord Jesus post, come flying like a young Hart or a Roe upon the mountains of separation. I think we should tell the hours carefully &amp; look often how low the sun is: For love hath no <hi>ho,</hi> it is pained, pained in it self, till it come in grips with the party beloved. 2. I finde Christ's absence love's sickness &amp; love's death: The wind that bloweth out of the airth where my Lord Jesus reigneth, is sweet-smelled, soft, joyfull, &amp; heartsom to a soul burnt with absence. It is a painfull battel for a soul sick of love to fight with absence &amp; delayes: Christ's <hi>not yet,</hi> is a stounding of all the joynts &amp; liths of the soul: a nod of his head when he is under a mask would be half a pawne: to say, <hi>fool, what aileth thee? He is coming,</hi> would be life to a dead man. I am often in my dumb sabbaths seeking a new plea with my Lord Jesus, God forgive me: &amp; I care not, if there be not two or three ounce weight of black wrath in my cup. For the 3 Thing, I have seen my abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vileness: If I were well known there would none in this Kingdom ask how I doe: Men take my ten to be an hundred, but I am a deeper hypocrite &amp; shallower professour then every one beleeveth, God knoweth I feigne not: But I think, my reckonings on the one page written in great letters, &amp; his mercy to such a forlorn &amp; wretched Dyvour on the other, more then a miracle. If I could get my finger ends upon a full assurance, I trow I should grip fast: But my cup wanteth not gall, &amp; upon my part despair might be almost excused, if every one in this land saw my inner side: But I know I am one of them who have made great sale &amp; a free market to free grace: If I could be saved, as I would fain beleeve, sure I am I have given Christ's blood, his free grace &amp; the bowels of his mercy, a large field to work upon, &amp; Christ hath manifested his art [I dare not say, to the uttermost; for he can, if he would, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give all the Devils &amp; damned reprobates in respect of the wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his mercy] I say, to an admirable degree. 4. I am striken with fear of unthankfulness: This Apostate Kirk hath played the harlot with many lovers; they are spitting in the face of my lovely King and mocking him and I

dow not mend it, &amp; they are running away from Christ in troops, and I dow not mourn &amp; be grieved for it: I think Christ lieth like an old forecasten castle forsaken of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, all men run away now from him: Truth, innocent Truth goeth mourning &amp; wringing her hands in sackcloth &amp; ashes. Woe, woe, woe is me, for the virgin-daughter of <hi>Scotland:</hi> Woe, woe to the inhabitants of this land, for they are gone back with a perpetual backsliding: These things take me so up, that a borrowed bed, another man's fire-side, the wind upon my face. [I being driven from my lovers &amp; dear acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance &amp; my poor flock,] finde no room in my sorrow: I have no spare of odde sorrow for these: Onely I think the sparrows and swallows that build their nests in the Kirk of <hi>Anwoth</hi> blessed birds: Nothing hath given my faith a harder back-set, till it crack again, then my closed mouth: But let me be miserable my self alone, God keep my dear bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren from it: But still I keep breath, &amp; when my royal and never, never-enough praised King returneth to his sinfull pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, I ride upon the high places of <hi>Iacob,</hi> I divide <hi>Shechem,</hi> I triumph in his strength: If this Kingdom would glorifie the Lord in my behalf, I desire to be weighed in God's even bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance in this point, if I think not my wages payed to the full: I shall crave no more hire of Christ. <hi>Madam,</hi> pity me in this, &amp; help me to praise him: For what ever I be, the chief of sinners, a devil &amp; a most guilty devil, yet it is the apple of Christ's eye, his honour &amp; glory as the head of the church, that I suffer for now, &amp; that I will goe to eternity with.

I am content with my own cross, that Christ hath made mine by an eternal lot, because it is Christ's &amp; mine together. I marvel not that winter is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heaven, for there is no winter within it: All the saints therefore have their own measure of winter before their eternal summer. Oh for the long day &amp; the high sun &amp; the fair garden &amp; the King's great citie up above these visible heavens! What God layeth on, let us suffer: For some have one cross, some seven, some ten, some half a cross, yet all the saints have whole &amp; full ioy, &amp; seven crosses have seven ioyes. Christ is cumbred with me [to speak so] &amp; my cross, but he falleth not off me, we are not at variance.

Now, <hi>very worthy Sir,</hi> I am glad in the Lord, that the Lord reserveth any of your place, or of note, in this time of common Apostacy, to come forth in publike to bear Christ's name before men, when the great men think Christ a cumbersom neighbour and that religion carrieth hazards, trials &amp; persecutions with it. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade my self, it is your glory &amp; your garland &amp; shall be your joy in the day of Christ, &amp; the standing of your house &amp; seed to inherit the earth, that ye truly &amp; sincerely profess Christ: Neither is our King, whom the father hath crowned in mount <hi>Zion,</hi> so weak, that he cannot doe for himself &amp; his own cause. I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily beleeve, they are blessed who can hold the crown upon his head and carry up the train of his robe royal, and that he shall yet be victorious and triumph in this land. It is our part to back our royal King, howbeit there were not six in all the land to follow him. It is wisdom now to take up and discern the devil &amp; the Antichrist coming out in their whites, &amp; the Apostacy &amp; Idolatry of this land washen with foul

water: I confess it is art to wash the Devil till his skin be white: For my self, <hi>Sir,</hi> I have bought a plea against Christ since I came hither, in judging my princely Master angry at me, because I was cast out of the vineyard as a withered tree, my dumb sabbaths working me much sorrow: But I see now sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row hath not eyes to read love written upon the cross of Christ, &amp; therefore I pass from my rash plea: Woe, woe is me that I should have received a slander of Christ's love to my soul: &amp; for all this, my Lord Jesus hath forgiven all, as not willing to be heard with such a fool, &amp; is content to be as it were confined with me &amp; to bear me company &amp; to feast a poor oppressed pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner. And now I write it under my hand, <hi>Worthy Sir,</hi> that I think well &amp; honourably of this cross of Christ: I wonder that he will take any glory from the like of me: I finde that when he but sendeth his hearty commendations to me, &amp; but bloweth a kiss afar off, I am confounded with wondering what the supper of the Lamb will be, up in our father's dining-palace of glory, since the four-hours in his dismall wilderness, &amp; when in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons &amp; in our sad dayes a kiss of Christ is so comfortable, O how sweet &amp; glorious shall our case be, when that fairest among the sons of men shall lay his fair face to our now sinfull faces, &amp; wipe away all tears from our eyes! O Time, Time, run swiftly &amp; hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en that day! O sweet Lord Jesus, come flying like a roe or a young hart! Alas that we blinde fools are fallen in love with moon-shine &amp; shadows! how sweet is the wind that bloweth out of the airth where Christ is! Every day we may see some new thing in Christ, his love hath neither brim nor bottom. Oh if I had help to praise him! He knoweth if my sufferings glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his name, &amp; encourage others to stand fast for the honour of our supream Law-giver Christ, my wages then are payed to the full. <hi>Sir,</hi> help me to love that never-enough praised Lord. I finde now that the faith of the saints under suffering for Christ is fair before the wind &amp; with full sails carried upon Christ, &amp; I hope to lose nothing in this furnace but dross; for Christ can triumph in a weaker man then I am, if there be any such: And when all is done, his love paineth me &amp; leaveth me under such debt to Christ as I can neither pay principal nor interest. Oh

if he would comprize my self, &amp; if I were sold to him as a bond-man, &amp; that he would take me home to his house &amp; fire-side; for I have nothing to render to him! Then after me let no man think hard of Christ's sweet cross, for I would not change my sighs with the painted laughter of all my adversaries. I desire grace in patience to wait on, &amp; to lie upon the brink till the water fill &amp; flow: I know he is fast coming. <hi>Sir,</hi> ye will excuse my boldness, &amp; till it please God I see you, ye have the prayers of a prisoner of Christ, to whom I recommend you &amp; in whom I rest.</p>

               <p>HOld fast Christ without wavering, &amp; contend for the faith, because Christ is not easily gotten nor kept: The lazie professour hath put heaven [as it were] at the very next door, &amp; thinketh to flye up to heaven in his bed and in a night-dream; but truly that is not so easie a thing as most men beleeve: Christ himself did sweat ere he won this city, howbeit he was the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Heir. It is Christianity, <hi>My heart,</hi> to be sincere, unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, honest &amp; upright-hearted before God, &amp; to live &amp; serve God, suppose there were not one man or woman in all the world dwelling beside you to eye you: Any little grace that ye have, see that it be sound &amp; true: Ye may put a difference betwixt you and reprobats if ye have these markes. 1. If ye prize Christ &amp; his truth so, as ye will sell all &amp; buy him &amp; suffer for it. 2. If the love of Christ keepeth you back from sinning more then the Law or fear of hell. 3. If ye be humble, &amp; deny your own <hi>will, wit, credit, ease, honour,</hi> the <hi>world</hi> &amp; the vainity &amp; glory of it. 4. Your profession must not be barren &amp; void of good works. 5. Ye must in all things aime at God's honour, ye must eat, drink, sleep, buy, sell, sit, stand, speak, pray,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:57570:211"/>
read, and hear the word with a heart-purpose that God may be honoured. 6. Ye must shew your self an enemy to sin, and reprove the works of darkness, such as drunkenness, swearing &amp; lying, albeit the company should hate you for doing so. 7. Keep in minde the truth of God that ye heard me teach, and have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to doe with the corruptions and new guises entred into the house of God. 8. Make conscience of your calling, in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, in buying &amp; selling. 9. Acquaint your self with daily praying, commit all your wayes &amp; actions to God by prayer, supplication &amp; thank giving, and count not much of being mocked; for Christ Jesus was mocked before you. Perswade your self that this is the way of peace and comfort I now suffer for, I dare goe to death &amp; in to eternity with it, though men may possibly seek another way. Remember me in your prayers, &amp; the state of this oppressed Church. Grace be with you.</p>

soul, lose no more time, run fast for it is late: God hath sworn by himself who made the world and time, that time shall be no more, Rev. 10 Ye are now upon the very border of the other life; your Lord cannot be blamed for not giving you warning: I have taught the truth of Christ to you &amp; delivered unto you the whole counsel of God, &amp; I have stood before the Lord for you, &amp; I shall yet still stand: awake, awake to doe righteously: Think not to be eased of the burthens &amp; debts that are on your house, by oppressing any or being rigorous to these that are under you: remember how I endeavoured to walk before you in this matter as an example: behold here am I, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness against me, before the Lord &amp; his Anointed, whose ox or whoseass have I taken? Whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed? Who knoweth how my soul feedeth upon a good conscience, when I remember how I spent this body in feeding the lambs of Christ? At my first entry hither, I grant, I took a stomack against my Lord, because he had casten me over the dike of the vineyard as a dry tree, &amp; would have no more of my service: My dumb sabbaths broke my heart, and I would not be comforted: but now he whom my soul love this come again, and it pleaseth him to feast me with the kisses of his love: A King dineth with me and his spikenard casteth a sweet smell: The Lord my witness is above, that I write my heart to you, I never knew by my nine years preaching, so much of Christ's love, as he hath taught me in <hi>Aberden</hi> by six moneths imprisonment. I charge you in Christ's name help me to praise &amp; shew that people &amp; countrey, the loving kindness of the Lord to my soul, that so my sufferings may someway preach to them when I am silent: He hath made me know now better then before, what it is to be crucified to the world: I would not now give a drink of cold water for all the world's kindness: I ow no service to it: I am not the flesh's debter: My Lord Jesus hath dâted his prisoner, &amp; hath thoughts of love concerning me: I would not exchange my sighs with the laughing of my adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries. <hi>Sir,</hi> I write this to inform you, that ye may know it is the truth of Christ I now suffer for, &amp; he hath sealed nay sufferings with the comforts of his spirit on my soul, &amp; I know
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:57570:212"/>
he putteth not his seal upon blank paper. Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> I have no comfort earthly, but to know that I have espoused, and shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent a bride to Christ in that congregation. The Lord hath given you much, and therefore he will require much of you again: Number your talents &amp; see what ye have to render back again, ye cannot be enough perswaded of the shortness of your time: I charge you to write to me, &amp; in the fear of God be plain with me, whether or no ye have made your salvation sure, I am confident &amp; hope the best, but I know your reckonings with your Judge are many and deep. <hi>Sir,</hi> be not beguiled, neglect not your one thing [Philip. 3, 13] your one necessary thing [Luke 10: 42] the good part that shall not be taken from you. Look beyond time: things here are but moon-shine, they have but Childrens wit who are delighted with shadows &amp; deluded withfeathers flying in the air. Desire your children in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their life to begin &amp; seek the Lord, &amp; to remember their Creator in the dayes of their youth [Eccles. 12: 1.] to cleanse their way by taking heed thereto according to God's word [Ps. 119: 9.] youth is a glassy age: Satan findes a swept chamber [for the most part] in youth-hood, &amp; a garnished lodging for himself &amp; his train: Let the Lord have the flower of their age: The best sacrifice is due to him: Instruct them in this, that they have a soul, &amp; that this life is nothing in comparison of eternity: They will have much need of God's conduct in this world, to guide them by these rocks upon which most men split; but far more need when it cometh to the hour of death &amp; their compear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance before Christ. O that there were such a heart in them to fear the name of the great &amp; dreadfull God, who hath laid up great things for these that love &amp; fear him! I pray that God may be their portion. Show others of my parishoners, that I write to them my best wishes and the blessings of their lawfull Pastor: Say to them from me, that I beseech them by the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of Christ, to keep in minde the Doctrine of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, which I taught them; that so they may lay hold on eternal life, striving together for the faith of the Gospel, &amp; making sure salvation to themselves: Walk in love &amp; doe righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness: seek peace, love one another, wait for the coming of our

Master &amp; Judge: Receive no doctrine contrary to that which I delivered to you: If ye fall away &amp; forget it &amp; that Catechisme which I taught you, &amp; so forsake your own mercy, the Lord be judge betwixt you &amp; me, I take heaven &amp; earth to witness, that such shall eternally perish; but if they serve the Lord, great will their reward be, when they &amp; I shall stand before our Judge. Set forward up the mountain to meet with God: climb up, for your Saviour calleth on you. It may be, God call you to your rest when I am far from you, but ye have my love &amp; the desires of my heart for your souls wel-fare.

               <p>I Long to hear whether or not your soul be hand-fasted with Christ: Lose your time no longer: Flee the follies of youth: Gird up the loins of your minde, &amp; make you ready for meeting the Lord. I have often summoned you, &amp; now I summond you again, to compear before your Judge, to make a reckoning of your life: while ye have Time, look upon your papers &amp; consider your wayes: O that there were such an heart in you, as to think what an ill conscience will be to you, when yeare upon the border of eternity, &amp; your one foot out of time! O then, ten thousand thousand floods of tears cannot extinguish these flames, or purchase to you one hour's release from that pain! O how sweet a day have ye had! But this is a fair day that runneth fast away, see how ye have spent it, &amp; consider the necessity of salvation: &amp; tell me [in the fear of God] if ye have made it sure: I am perswaded ye have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science that will be speaking somewhat to you: Why will ye die &amp; destroy yourself?

up your conscience, &amp; begin to indent &amp; contract with Christ in time while salvation is in your offer: This is the accepted time, this is the day of salvation: play the marchant, for ye cannot expect another market-day when this is done; therefore let me again beseech you to <hi>consider in this your day, the things that belong to your peace, before they be hid from your eyes. Dear Brother,</hi> fulfill my joy, &amp; begin to seek the Lord while he may be found: Forsake the follies of deceiving &amp; vain youth: Lay hold upon eternall life: Whoring, night-drinking, &amp; mispending of the sabbath, &amp; neglecting of prayer in your house, &amp; refusing of an offered salvation, will burn up your soul with the terrours of the Almighty, when your awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened conscience shall flee in your face. Be kinde &amp; loving to your wife, make conscience of cherishing her and not being rigidly austere. <hi>Sir,</hi> I have not a tongue to express the glory that is laid up for you in your father's house, if ye reform your doings and frame your heart to return to the Lord. Ye know this world is but a shadow, a short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>living creature, under the law of time; within less then fifty yeers, when ye look back to it, ye shall laugh at the evanishing vanities thereof, as feathers flying in the air, and at the houses of sand within the sea-mark, which the children of men are building: Give up with courting of this vain world: Seek not the bastard's moveables, but the Son's heritage in heaven. Take a trial of Christ, look unto him &amp; his love shall so change you, that ye shall be taken with him &amp; never chuse to goe from him: I have experience of his sweetness in this house of my pilgrimage here: My witness who is above, knoweth, I would not exchange my sighs &amp; tears with the laughing of the fourteen Prelats: There is nothing will make you a Christian indeed, but a taste of the sweetness of Christ, <hi>come and see</hi> will speak best to your soul: I would fain hope good of you: be not discouraged at broken &amp; spilt- resolutions, but to it, &amp; to it again: Wooe about Christ, till ye get your soul espoused as a chaste virgin to him: Use the means of profiting with your conscience: Pray in your family, &amp; read, the word: Remember how our Lord's day was spent
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:57570:213"/>
when I was among you: It will be a great challenge to you before God, if ye forget the good that was done within the walls of your house on the Lord's dayes, &amp; if ye turn aside after the fashions of this world, &amp; if ye goe not in time to the kirk to wait on the publike worship of God, &amp; if ye tarry not at it, till all the exercises of religion be ended: Give God some of your time both morning &amp; evening &amp; afternoon, &amp; in so doing, rejoyce the heart of a poor oppressed prisoner. Rue upon your own soul, &amp; from your heart fear the Lord. Now he that brought again from the dead the great Shepherd of his sheep, by the blood of the eternall Covenant, establish your heart with his grace, &amp; present you before his presence with joy.</p>

               <p>I Will not impute your not writing to me, to forgetfulness: how ever, I have one above who forgetteth me not, nay, he grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his kindess: It hath pleased his holy Majesty to take me from the pulpit &amp; teach me many things in my exile &amp; prison that were mysteries to me before: As, 1. I see his bottomless &amp; boundless love &amp; kindness, &amp; my jealousies &amp; ravings, which at my first entry into this furnace were so foolish &amp; bold, as to say to Christ, who is truth it self, in his face, <hi>thou liest.</hi> I had well nigh lost my grips: I wondered if it was Christ or not, for the mist &amp; smoke of my perturbed heart, made me mistake my Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Jesus: My faith was dim &amp; hope frozen &amp; cold, &amp; my love which caused jealousies, it had some warmness &amp; heat &amp; smoke but no flame at all: yet I was looking for some good of Christ's old claim to me: I thought I had forfeited all my rights, but the tempter was too much upon my counsels &amp; was still blowing the coal: Alas I knew not well before how good skill my Intercessor and advocate, Christ, hath of pleading, and pardoning me such follies: Now he is returned to my soul with healing under his wings, and I am nothing behinde

with Christ now, for he hath overpaid me by his presence, the pain I was put to by on-waiting, and any little loss I sustained by my witnessing against the wrongs done to him. I trow it was a pain to my Lord to hide himself any longer: In a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he was challenging his unkindness &amp; repented him of his glooms, &amp; now what want I on earth that Christ can give to a poor prisoner? O how sweet and lovely is he now! Alas that I can get none to help me to lift up my Lord Jesus upon his throne above all the earth! 2. I am now brought to some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of submission, and I resolve to wait till I see what my Lord Jesus will doe with me: I dare not now nick name or speak one word against the all-seeing &amp; over-watching providence of my Lord: I see, providence runneth not on broken wheels; but I like a fool carved a providence for mine own ease, to die in my nest, &amp; to sleep still till my gray hairs, and to lie on the sunny side of the mountain in my ministery at <hi>Anwoth:</hi> But now I have nothing to say against a borrowed fire-side &amp; another man's house, nor Kedars tents where I live, being removed far from my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, my lovers &amp; my friends: I see God hath the world on his wheels &amp; casteth it as a potter doeth a vessel on the wheel: I dare not say that there is any inordinat or irregular motion in Providence; The Lord hath done it, I will not goe to law with Christ, for I would again nothing of that. 3. I have learned some greater mortification &amp; not to mourn after or seek to suck the world's dry breasts: Nay, my Lord hath filled me with such dainties, that I am like to a full banquettor who is not for common chear. What have I to doe to fall down upon my knees &amp; worship mankind's great idol, <hi>The World?</hi> I have a better God then any clay-God; Nay, at present as I am now disposed, I care not much to give this world a discharge of my life-rent of it, for bread &amp; water: I know it is not my home, nor my father's house; it is but his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stool, the outer clo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

if my waters should stand, they would rot: Faith is the better of the free air, &amp; of the sharp winter-storm in it's face: Grace withereth without adversity: The Devil is but God's Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fencer to teach us to handle our weapons. 5. I never knew how weak I was till now, when he hideth himself, &amp; when I have him to seek seven times a day. I am a dry &amp; withered branch &amp; a piece of a dead carcase, dry bones &amp; not able to step over a straw: The thoughts of my old sins are as the summonds of death to me: And of late my Brother's case hath striken me to the heart; when my wounds are closing, a little rifle, causeth them to bleed afresh: So thin-skin'd is my soul, that I think it is like a tender man's skin, that may touch nothing: ye see how short I would shoot of the prize, if his grace were not sufficient for me. Woe's me for the day of Scotland, Woe, woe is me for my harlot-mother; for the decree is gone forth: women of this land shall call the childless &amp; miscarrying wombs blessed: The anger of the Lord is gone forth &amp; shall not return till he perform the purpose of his heart against Scotland: Yet he shall make Scotland a new sharp instrument having teeth to thresh the mountains &amp; fan the hills as chaff.

And for my self, if I had ten loves &amp; ten souls, O how glad would I be if he would break in upon me &amp; take possession of them all! Woe, woe is me, that He &amp; I are so far asunder! I hope we shall be in one countrey &amp; one house together: truly pain of love-sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for Jesus, maketh me to think it long, long, long to the dawning of that day. Oh that he would cut short years &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths &amp; hours, &amp; overleap Time, that we might meet! And for this truth, <hi>Sir,</hi> that ye profess, I avow before the world of men &amp; Angels, that it is the way &amp; onely way to our countrey, the rest are by-wayes; &amp; that what I suffer for, is the apple of Christ's eye, even his honour as Law-giver &amp; King of his Church.

I think the worst things of Christ, even his reproaches &amp; his cross [when I look on these not with bleared eyes] far rather to be chosen then, the laughter &amp; worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaten joys of my adversaries. Oh that they were as I am, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept my bonds!

Woe is me that I was so loose, rash, vain &amp; graceless in my unbeleeving thoughts of Christ's love: But what can a soul under a non-entry [when my rights were wod-set and lost] doe else, but make a false libel against Christ's love? I know your self, Madam, and many moe will be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses against me, if I repent not of my unbelief; for I have been seeking the Pope's wares, some hire for grace within my self: I have not learned as I should doe, to put my stock &amp; all my treasure in Christ's hand, but I would have a stock of mine own, &amp; ere I was aware, I was tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hire to be the Law's advocate, to seek Justification by works: I forgot that grace is the onely garland that is worn in heaven upon the heads of the glorified. And now I half rejoyce that I have sickness for Christ to work upon: since I must have wounds, well's my soul I have a day's work for my Physician Christ: I hope to give Christ his own calling, it setteth him full well to cure diseases. My ebbings are very low &amp; the tide is far out when my Beloved goeth away; &amp; then I cry, Oh cruelty! to put out the poor man's one eye &amp; that, that was my joy next to Christ, to preach my welbeloved, then I make a noise about Christ's house, looking uncouth-like in at his window &amp; casting my love &amp; my desires over the wall, till God send better.

I think I conceive new thoughts of heaven, because the Carde &amp; the Mappe of Haven that he letteth me now see, is so fair, &amp; so sweet: I am sure we are niggards &amp; sparing bodies in seeking: I verily judge, we know not how much may be had in this life, there is yet something beyond all we see, that seeking would light upon. O that my love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sickness would put me to a business, when all the world are sound sleeping, to cry &amp; knock! But the truth is, since I came hither, I have been wondering, that after my impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to have my fill of Christ's love, I have not gotten a reall sign, but have come from him crying, <hi>hunger, hunger.</hi> I think Christ letteth me see meat in my extremity of hunger, &amp; giveth me none of it: When I am near the apple he draweth back his hand &amp; goeth away, to cause me follow: And again when I am within an arm-length to the apple he maketh a now break to the gate, &amp; I have him to seek of new: He seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to pity my dwining &amp; my swooning for his love. I dare sometimes put my hunger over to him to be judged, if I would not buy him with a thousand years in the hottest furnace in hell, sobeing I might enjoy him: But my hunger is fed with want &amp; absence: I hunger &amp; I have not, but my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is to lie &amp; wait on, &amp; to put my poor soul &amp; my sufferings in Christ's hand: Let him make any thing out of me, sobeing he be glorified in my salvation, for I know I am made for him: O that my Lord may win his own gracious end in me!

<pb n="397" facs="tcp:57570:225"/>
what may we say of this world's laughing &amp; sporting themselves with gold &amp; silver &amp; honours &amp; court &amp; broad large conquests, but that they are poor souls in the height and rage of a fever gone mad? Then a straw, a fig for all created sports and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing out of Christ: Nay I think that this world at it's prime &amp; perfection, when it is is come to the top of it's excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and to the bloom, might be bought with an half penny, &amp; that it would scarce weigh the worth of a drink of water: There is nothing better then to esteem it our crucified idol, that is dead &amp; slain, as <hi>Paul</hi> did; <hi>

Then let pleasures be crucified, &amp; riches be crucified, &amp; court &amp; honour be crucified, &amp; since the Apostle faith, the world is crucified to him, we may put this world to the hanged man's doom and to the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, &amp; who will give much for a hanged man? &amp; as little should we give for a hanged &amp; crucified <hi>world:</hi> Yet what a sweet smell hath this dead carrion to many fools in the world, and how many wooers and suiters findeth this hanged carrion? Fools are pulling it off the gallowes and contending for it. O when shall we learn to be mortified men, &amp; to have our fill of these things that have but their short summer-quarter of this life! If we saw our father's house and that great and fair citie, the new <hi>Ierusalem</hi> which is up above sun &amp; moon, we would cry to be over the water &amp; to be carried in Christ's arms out of this borrowed pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.

I think Christ's love playeth the niggard to me, &amp; I know, it is not for scarcity of love, there is enough in him; but my hunger prophesieth of in-holding and sparingness in Christ, for I have but little of him and little of his sweetness: It is a dear summer with me, yet there is such joy in the eagerness &amp; working of hunger for Christ, that I am often at this, that if I had no other heaven but a continuall hunger for Christ, such a heaven of ever-working hunger, were still a heaven to me.

O how steadable a thing is a Saviour to make a sinner rid of his chains &amp; fetters!

<pb n="402" facs="tcp:57570:228"/>
it's above all price, God be thanked for ever that Christ was a told down price for Sanctification: Let a sinner [if possible] lie in hell for ever, if he make him truly holy, &amp; let him lie there burning in love to God, rejoycing in the Holy Ghost, hanging upon Christ by faith &amp; hope; that is heaven in the heart and bottom of hell. Alas, I finde a very thin harvest here &amp; few to be saved! Grace, grace be with you.</p>

But let me, <hi>my very dear &amp; worthy Lord,</hi> most humbly beseech you by the mercies of God, by the consolations of his Spirit, by the dear blood &amp; wounds of your lovely Redeemer, by the salvation of your soul, by your compearance before the awfull face of a sin-revenging &amp; dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Judge, not to set in comparison together your soul's peace, Christ's love &amp; his Kingly honour now called in question, with your place, honour, house, or ease, that an inch of time will make out of the way. I verily beleeve, Christ is now begging a testimony of you, &amp; is saying, <hi>And will ye also leave me.</hi> It is possible the wind shall not blow so fair for you all your life, for coming out &amp; appearing before others to back &amp; countenance Christ the fairest among the sons of men, the Prince of the Kings of the earth. Isa. 51. 7. <hi>Fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be afraid of their revilings. v. 8. For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, &amp; the worm shall eat them like wool.</hi> When the Lord shall begin, he shall make an end, &amp; mow down his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, and they shall lie before him like withered hay, &amp; their bloom shaken off them. Consider how many thousands in this Kingdom veshall cause to fall &amp; stumble, if ye goe with them, &amp; that ye shall be out of the prayers of many who doe stand before the Lord for you &amp; your house: &amp; further, when the time of your accounts cometh, &amp; your one foot shall be within the border of eternity, &amp; the eye-strings shall break, &amp; the face wax pale, &amp; the

I have found by experience since the time of my impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment [my witness is above] Christ fealing this honourable cause with another &amp; a nearer fellowship then ever I knew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and let God weigh me in an even ballance in this, if I

               <p>GRace, mercy &amp; peace be to you: Though not acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet at the desire of a Christian brother, I thought good to write a line unto you, intreating you in the Lord Jesus under your trials, to keep an ear open to Christ, who can speak for himself, howbeit your visitations and your own sense should dream hard things of his love and favour: Our Lord never getteth so kinde a look of us, nor our love in such a degree, nor our faith in such a
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:57570:233"/>
measure of stedfastness, as he getteth out of the furnace of our tempting fears &amp; sharp trials. I verily beleeve [&amp; too sad proofs in me, say no less] that if our Lord would grind our whorish lust in powder, the very old ashes of our corruption should take life again, and live and hold us under so much bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age that may humble us &amp; make us sad, till we be in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey where we shall need no Physick at all. O what violent means doth our Lord use to gain us to him, as if indeed we were a prize worthy his fighting for! And be sure if <hi>leading</hi> would doe the turn, he would not use <hi>pulling of hair and drawing:</hi> But the best of us will bide a strong pull of our Lord's right arm ere we follow him: Yet I say not this as if our Lord alwayes measured afflictions by so many ounce weights answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the grain weights of our guiltiness: I know he doeth in many [and possibly in you] seek nothing so much as faith that can endure summer and winter in their extremity. O how precious to the Lord is faith and love, that when thresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, beaten, and chased away, and boasted [as it were] by God himself, doeth yet look warm-like, love-like, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and life-like home-over to Christ, &amp; would be in at him, ill &amp; well as it may be! Think not much that your husband or the dearest to you in the world, proveth to have the bowels &amp; mercy of the Ostrich, hard &amp; rigourous &amp; cruel: For <hi>Psal.</hi> 27. 10. The Lord taketh up such fallen ones as these. I could not wish a more sweet life nor more satisfying expressions of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness till I be up at that Prince of kindness, then the Lord's saints finde when the Lord taketh up mens refuse &amp; lodgeth this world's out-lawes whom no man seeketh after: His breath is never so hot, his love casteth never such a flame, as when this world and these who should be the helpers of our joy, cast water on our coal: It is a sweet thing to see them cast out, &amp; God take in, &amp; to see them throw us away as the refuse of men, &amp; God take us up as his jewels &amp; his treasure: Often he maketh gold of dross, as once he made the cast-away stone, the stone rejected by the builders, the head of the corner. The Princes of this world would not have our Lord Jesus a pinning in the wall or to have any place in the building, but the Lord
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:57570:234"/>
made him the Master-stone of power &amp; place. God be thanked that this world hath not power to cry us down so many pounds, as rulers cry down light gold, or light silver: We shall stand for as much as our master-coiner <hi>Christ,</hi> whose coin, arms &amp; stamp we bear, will have us: Christ hath no miscarrying ballance. Thank your Lord, who chaseth your love through two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms &amp; followeth you &amp; it over sea, to have you for himself, as he speaketh <hi>Hos.</hi> 3. For God layeth up his saints as the waile &amp; the choice of all the world for himself, &amp; this is like Christ &amp; his love. O what in heaven or out of heaven is comparable to the smell of Christ's garments! Nay, suppose our Lord would manifest his art, &amp; make ten thousand heavens of good &amp; glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things, &amp; of new joyes devised out of the deep of infinite wisdom, he could not make the like of Christ, for Christ is God, &amp; God cannot be made: &amp; therefore let us hold us with Christ, howbeit we might have our waile &amp; will of an host of lovers, as many as three heavens could contain. O that he &amp; we were together! O when Christ &amp; ye shall meet about the outmost march &amp; borders of time &amp; the entry into eternity, ye shall see heaven in his face at the first look, &amp; salvation &amp; glory sitting in his countenance &amp; betwixt his eyes! Faint not, the miles to heaven are but few &amp; short: he is making a green bed [as the word speaketh <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.] of love for himself &amp; you: There are many heads lying in Christ's bosom, but there is room for yours among the rest: And therefore goe on &amp; let hope goe before you: Sin not in your trials, &amp; the victory is yours: pray, wrestle &amp; beleeve, &amp; ye shall overcome &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with God as <hi>Iacob</hi> did: No windle-straws, no bits of clay, no temptations which are of no longer life then an hour, will then be able to withstand you, when once ye have prevailed with God. Help me with your prayers, that it would please the Lord to give me house-room again, to speak of his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onsness in the great congregation, if it may seem good in his sight. Grace, grace be with you.</p>

I know, in spiritual confidence the Devil will come in, as in all other good works, &amp; cry <hi>half mine,</hi> &amp; so endeavour to bring you under a fearfull sleep, till he whom your soul loveth be departed from the door &amp; have left off knocking &amp; therefore, here the Spirit of God

must hold your souls feet in the golden mid-line betwixt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent resting in the arms of Christ, &amp; presumptuous and drousie sleeping in the bed of fleshly security. Therefore, <hi>worthy Lady,</hi> so count little of your self, because of your own wretchedness and sinfull drousiness, that ye count not also little of God in the course of his unchangeable mercy: For there be many Christians, most like unto young sailers, who think the shore &amp; the whole land doeth move, when the ship &amp; they themselves are moved; just so, not a few doe imagine that God moveth &amp; saileth &amp; chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth places, because their giddy souls are under sail &amp; subject to alteration, to ebbing &amp; flowing; but <hi>the foundation of the Lord abideth sure.</hi> God knoweth that ye are his own: Wrestle, fight, goe forward, watch, fear, beleeve, pray, &amp; then ye have all the infallible symptomes of one of the elect of Christ within you. Ye have now, <hi>Madam,</hi> a sickness before you &amp; also after that a death, gather then now food for the journey: God give you eyes to see through sickness &amp; death, &amp; to see something beyond death. I doubt not but if hell were betwixt you &amp; Christ, as a river which ye behooved to cross ere ye could come at him, but ye would willingly put in your foot &amp; make through to be at him, upon hope that he would come in himself in the deepest of the river &amp; lend you his hand. Now I beleeve your hell is dried up &amp; ye have onely these two shallow brooks, <hi>Sickness</hi> &amp; <hi>Death,</hi> to pass through, &amp; ye have also a promise that Christ shall doe more then meet you, even that he shall come himself &amp; goe with you foot for foot, yea &amp; bear you in his arms. O then! O then for the joy that is set before you! For the love of the man [who is also God over all, blessed for ever] that is standing upon the shore to welcome you, run your race with patience: The Lord goe with you. Your Lord will not have you nor any of his servants to exchange for the worse. <hi>Death</hi> in it self includeth both the death of the soul &amp; the death of the body, but to God's children the bounds &amp; the limits of death are abridged &amp; drawn into a more narrow compass: So that when ye die, a piece of death shall onely seise upon you, or the least part of you shall die, &amp; that is the dissolution of the body; for in Christ ye are delivered from the second death: &amp;
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:57570:236"/>
therefore, as one born of God commit not sin [although ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live &amp; not sin] &amp; that serpent shall but eat your earthly part? As for your soul, it is above the law of Death: But it is fearfull &amp; dangerous to be a debter and servant to sin, for the count of sin ye will not be able to make good before God, except Christ both count &amp; pay for you. I trust also, <hi>Madam,</hi> that ye will be carefull to present to the Lord the present estate of this decaying Kirk: For, what shall be concluded in Parliament anent her, the Lord knoweth: sure I am, the decree of a most fearfull Parliament in heaven, is at the very point of coming forth, because of the sins of the land: For, <hi>We have cast away the law of the Lord and despised the words of the holy one of Israel, Isa. 5, 24.

I would not have you pitch upon me as the man able by lettters to answer doubts of this kinde, while there are in your bounds, men of such great parts, most able for this work: I know the best are unable, yet it pleaseth that Spirit of Jesus to blow his sweet wind through a pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ce dry stick, that the empty reed may keep no glory to it self; but a Minister can make no such wind as this to blow, he is scarce able to lend it a passage to blow through him. 2. Know that the wind of this Spirit hath a time when it bloweth sharp &amp; pierceth so strongly that it would blow through an iron door, &amp; this is commonly rather under suffering for Christ then at any other time: Sick children get of Christ's pleasant things to play them withall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Jesus is most tender of the sufferer, for he was a sufferer himself. O if I had but the leavings &amp; the drawing of the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board of a sufferer's table! But <hi>I</hi> leave this to answer yours.</p>

Matth.</hi> 26. 33. Nature is a sluggard &amp; loveth not the labour of religion: Therefore rest should not be taken till we know the disease be over &amp; in the way of turning, &amp; that it is like a fever past the cool: And the quietness &amp; the calms of the faith of victory over corruption, would be entertained in place of security, so that if I sleep, I would desire to sleep faith's sleep in Christ's bosom. 2. Know also, none that sleep sound can
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:57570:237"/>
seriously complain of sleepiness, sorrow for a slumbering soul, is a token of some watchfulness of spirit: But this is soon turned into wantonness, [as grace in us too often is abus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed] therefore our waking must be watched over, else sleep will even grow out of watching, &amp; there is as much need to watch over grace, as to watch over sin: full men will soon sleep &amp; sooner then hungry men. 3. For your weakness to keep off security, that like a thief stealeth upon you, I would say two things. 1. To want complaints of weakness, is for heaven &amp; Angels that never sinned, not for Christians in Christ's camp on earth: I think our weakness maketh us the Church of the redeemed ones &amp; Christ's field that the Mediator should labour in: If there were no diseases on earth, there needed no Physicians on earth: If Christ had cried down weakness, he might have cried down his own calling; but weakness is our Mediator's world, Sin is Christ's onely, onely fa e &amp; market; no man should rejoyce at weakness &amp; diseases, but I think we may have a sort of gladness at boils &amp; sores, because without them, Christ's fingers as a slain Lord should never have touched our skin. I dare not thank my self, but I dare thank God's depth of wise Providence, that I have an errand in me, while I live, for Christ to come &amp; visit me &amp; bring with him his drugs &amp; his balm. O how sweet is it, for a sinner to put his weakness in Christ's strengthning hand &amp; to father a sick soul upon such a Physician &amp; to lay weakness before him, to weep upon him &amp; to plead &amp; pray! weakness can speak &amp; cry when we have not a tongue. <hi>Ezek 16. 6. And when I passed by thee &amp; saw thee polluted in thine own blood, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live.</hi> The Kirk could not speak one word to Christ then, but blood &amp; guiltiness out of measure, spake, &amp; drew out of Christ pity &amp; a word of life and love. 2. For weakness, we have it, that we may employ Christ's strength because of our weakness: Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is to make us the strongest things, that is, when having no strength of our own, we are carried upon Christ's shoulders &amp; walk [as it were] upon his legs: If our sinfull weakness swell up to the clouds, Christ's strength will swell up to the sun and far above the heaven of heavens. 2. Ye tell me that there is
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:57570:237"/>
need of counsel for strengthning of new beginners, I can say little to that, who am not well begun my self; but I know, honest beginnings are nouri hed by him, even by lovely Jesus, who never yet put out a poor man's dim candle, who is wrestling betwixt light &amp; darkness. I am sure if new beginners would urge themselves upon Christ, &amp; press their souls upon him &amp; importune him for a draught of his sweet love, they could not come wrong to Christ: Come once in upon the right nick &amp; step of his lovely love, &amp; I defie you to get free of him again: If any beginners fall off Christ again &amp; miss him, they never lighted upon Christ as Christ; it was but an idol, like Jesus, they took for him. 3. Whereas ye complain of a dead Ministery in your bounds, ve are to remember that the Bible among you, is the contract of Marriage, &amp; the manner of Christ's conveying his love to your heart, is not so absolutly dependent upon, even lively preaching, as that there is no conversion at all, no life of God, but that, that is tied to a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n's lips: The daughters of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> have done often that, which the watchmen could not doe: Make Christ your Minister, he can wooe a soul at a dike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in the field, he needeth not us, howbeit the flock be obliged to seek him in the shepherds tents: Hunger of Christ's making may thrive, even under stewards who minde not the feeding of the flock, O blessed soul, that can leap over a man and look above a pulpit up to Christ, who can preach home to the heart, howbeit we were all dead &amp; rotten! 4. So to complain of your self as to justifie God is right, and providing ye justifie his Spirit in your self; for men seldom advocate against Satan's work &amp; sin in themselves, but against Gods work in themselves: some of the people of God slander God's grace in their souls as some wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es use to doe, who complain &amp; murmure of want, I have nothing [say they] all is gone, the ground yeeldeth but weeds &amp; wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestraws; when as their fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I think it is not my sin, I have scarce wit to sin this fin: But I advise you to speak good of Christ, for his beauty &amp; sweetness, &amp; speak good of him for his grace to your selves. 5.

But for the matter of the complaint I would say: The light of glory is perfectly obeyed in loving and praising and rejoyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; resting in a seen &amp; known Lord; but that light is not hereaway in any clay body, for while we are here, light i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> in the most part broader &amp; longer then our narrow &amp; feckless obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: But if there be light with a fair train &amp; a great back, I mean, armies of challenging thoughts &amp; sorrow for coming short of performance in what we know &amp; see ought to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, then that sorrow for not doing is accepted of our Lord for doing: Our honest sorrow &amp; sincere aimes, together with Christ's intercession pleading that God would welcome that which we have &amp; forgive what we have not, must be our life, till we be over the bound-road &amp; in the other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, where the law will get a perfect soul. 6. In Christ's absence there is [as ye write] a willingness to use means, but heaviness after the use of them, because of formal &amp; slight performance. In Christ's absence I confess the work lieth behinde, but if ye mean absence of comfort &amp; absence of sense of his sweet presence, I think that absence is Christ's trying of us, not simply our sin against him: Therefore howbeit our Obedience then, be not sugared and sweetned with joy [which is the sweet meat bairns would still be at] yet the less sense &amp; the more willingness in obeying, the less formality in our obedience, howbeit we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> not so; for I beleeve many think obedience formal &amp; lif les, except the wind be fair in the West, and sails filled with joy and sense, till souls like a ship fair before the wind can spread no more sail; but I am not of their minde who think so. But if ye mean by absence of Christ, the withdrawing of his working grace, I see not how willingness to use means can be at all under such an absence: Therefore be humbled for heaviness in that obedience, &amp; thankfull for willingness: for the Bridegroom is busking his Spouse often times while she is
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:57570:238"/>
half sleeping, &amp; your Lord is working &amp; helping more then ye see. Also I recommend to you Heaviness for formality &amp; lifeless deadness in obedience: Be casten down as much as ye will or can, for deadness, and challenge that slow &amp; dull carcase of sin that will neither lead nor drive in your spirituall obedience. O how sweet to lovely Jesus are bills and grievances given in against corruption &amp; the body of fin! I would have Christ, in such a case, fashed [if I may speak so] &amp; deaved with our cries, as ye see the Apostle doeth, <hi>Rom. 7, 24. O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death!</hi> Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions against the law of sin in you, are law-grounds why sin can have no law against you: Seek to have your Protestation dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed &amp; judged, &amp; then shall ye finde Christ on your side of it. 7. Ye hold that Christ must either have hearty service or no service at all: If ye mean he will not half a heart or have fained service, such as the hypocrites give him, I grant you that: Christ must have honesty or nothing: But if ye mean, he will have no service at all where the heart draweth aback in any measure, I would not that were true, for my part of heaven and all that I am worth in the world: If ye minde to walk to heaven without a cramp or a crook, I fear ye must goe your alone: He knoweth our dross &amp; defects, &amp; sweet Jesus pitieth us when weakness &amp; deadness in our obedience is our cross &amp; not our darling. 8. The liar [as ye write] challengeth the work as formal, yet ye bless your cautioner for the ground-work he hath laid &amp; dare not say but ye have assurance in some measure. To this I say. 1. It shall be no fault to saye Satan's labour, &amp; challenge it your self, or at least examine &amp; censure; but beware of Satan's ends in chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging, for he mindeth to put Christ &amp; you at oddes. 2. Welcome home faith in Jesus, who washeth still when we have defiled our souls and made our selves loathsom, &amp; seek still the blood of atonement to faults little or meekle: Know the gate to the well &amp; lie about it. 3. Make meekle of assur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, for it keepeth your anchor fixed. 9. Out-breakings [ye say] discourage you, so that ye know not if ever ye shall win again to such overjoying consolations of the Spirit in this life,

as formerly ye had, &amp; therefore a question may be, <hi>If after assur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance &amp; mortification, the children of God be ordinarly fed with sense &amp; joy?</hi> I answer, I see no inconvenience to think, it's enough in a race, to see the gold at the starting place; howbeit the runners never get a view of it till they come to the rink's end, &amp; that our wise Lord thinketh it fittest we should not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be singering &amp; playing with Christ's apples. Our Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloved, I know, will sport &amp; play with his Bride, as much as he thinketh will allure her to the rink's end: Yet I judge it not unlawfull to seek renewed consolations, providing first, the heart be submissive &amp; content, to leave the measure &amp; t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Let them be sought not for our humors or swelling of nature; but as the earnest of heaven: &amp; I think many doe attain to greater consolations after mortification then ever they had formerly: But I know, our Lord walketh here, still by a soveraign latitude, &amp; keepeth not the same way as to one hair-breadth without a miss, towards all his children. As for the Lord's people with you, I am not the man fit to speak to them. I rejoyce exceedingly that Christ is engaging souls amongst you: But I know in conversion all the winning is in the first buying [as we use to say] for many lay false &amp; bastard foundations, &amp; take up conversion at their foot, &amp; get Christ for as good as half nothing, and had never a sick night for sin, &amp; this maketh loosework: I pray you dig deep, Christ's Palace-work, &amp; his n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I pray the Lord to give you all your own, &amp; to grace you with patience, to give God his also: he is an ill debter who payeth that which he hath borrowed, with a grudge: indeed that long loan of such a good daughter, an heir of grace, a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Christ [as I beleeve] deserveth more thanks at your Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor's hand, then that ye should gloom &amp; murmure when he craveth but his own: I beleeve ye would judge them to be but thankless neighbours, who would pay you a summe of money after this manner.

Consider what the Lord is doing in it, your daughter is plucked out of the fire &amp; she resteth from her labours, &amp; your Lord in that is trying you &amp; casting you in the fire: Goe through all fires to your rest, &amp; now remember that the eye of God is upon you, beholding your patience &amp; faith: he delighteth to see you in the burning bush &amp; not consumed, &amp; he is gladly content that such a weak woman as ye, should send Satan away frustrate of his design: Now honour God &amp; shame the strong roaring lion,

And goe wheresoever ye will, if your Lord goe with you, ye are at home, &amp; your lodging is ever taken before night, so long as he who is <hi>Israel's</hi> dwelling house is your home, <hi>Psal.</hi> 90, 1.

there are fair ease-rooms &amp; pleasant lights, if ye can in faith lean down your head upon the breast of Jesus Christ, &amp; till this be, ye shall never get a sound sleep: Jesus, Jesus be your sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow &amp; your covering: It is a sweet soul-sleep to lie in the arms of Christ, for his breath is very sweet.

               <p>I Salute you with grace, mercy &amp; peace from God our father, &amp; from our Lord Iesus Christ. I promised to write to you, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though late enough, yet now I make it good. I heard with grief, of your great danger of perishing by the sea, but of your merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full deliverance with joy. Sure I am, <hi>Brother,</hi> Satan will leave no stone unrolled [as the proverb is] to roll you off your rock, or at least to shake &amp; unsettle you: For at that same time, the mouths of wicked men were opened in hard speeches against you by land, &amp; the Prince of the power of the air was angry with

you by sea: See then how much ye are obliged to that malitions murderer, who would beat you with two rods at one time, but blessed be God, his arm is short: If the sea &amp; winds would have obeyed him, ye had never come to land: Thank your God who saith: <hi>Rev. 1, 18. I have the keys of hell and of death. Deut, 32, 39. I kill and I make alive. 1, Sam. 2, 6. The Lord bringeth down to the grave and bringeth up.</hi> If Satan were Iayl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Ye were knocking at these black gates and ye found the doors shut, and we doe all welcome you back again: I trust ye know it is not for nothing, that ye are sent to us again: The Lord knew ye had forgotten something that was necessary for your journey, that your armour was not as yet thick enough against the stroke of death: Now in the strength of Jesus, dispatch your business: that debt is not forgiven, but fristed: Death hath not bidden you <hi>fare-well,</hi> but hath onely left you for a short season: End your journey ere the night come upon you, have all in readiness against the time that ye must sail through that black &amp; impetuous <hi>Iordan,</hi> &amp; Jesus, Jesus who knoweth both these depths &amp; the rocks &amp; all the coasts, be your Pilot: That last tide will not wait for you one moment: if ye forget any thing, when your sea is full &amp; your foot in that ship, there is no returning again to fetch it: What ye doe amiss in your life to day, ye may amend it to morrow: for as many suns as God maketh to arise upon you, ye have as many new lives: but ye can die but once, &amp; if ye mar or spill that business, ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come back to mend that piece of work again: No man sinneth twice in dying ill: As we die but once, so we die but ill or well once. Ye see now the number of your moneths is written in God's book, &amp; as one of the Lord's hirelings, ye must work till the shadow of the evening come upon you, &amp; ye shall run out your glass even to the last pickle of sand: fulfill your course with joy, for we take nothing to the grave with us, but a good or evil conscience. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the skie clear after this storm, yet clouds will engender another: Ye contracted with Christ, I hope, when first ye
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:57570:243"/>
began to follow him, that ye would bear his cross; fulfill your part of the Contract with patience &amp; break not to Jesus Christ: Be honest, <hi>Brother,</hi> in your bargaining with him, for who knoweth better how to bring up children then our God? For [to lay aside his knowledge, of the which there is no searching out] he hath been practised in bringing up his heirs these 5000 years, &amp; his bairns are all well brought up, &amp; many of them are honest men now at home up in their own house in heaven, &amp; are entred heirs to their father's inheritance: Now the form of his bringing up was by chastisements, scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, correcting, nurturing: See if he maketh exception of any of his bairns, <hi>Rev. 3. 19. Heb.</hi> 12. 7, 8. No: His eldest Son &amp; his heir, <hi>Iesus,</hi> is not excepted. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10. Suffer we must, ere we were born God dcreed it, &amp; it is easier to complain of his decree then to change it. It is true, terrors of conscience cast us down, &amp; yet without terrors of conscience we cannot be raised up again; fears &amp; doubtings shake us, &amp; yet without fears &amp; doubtings we would soon sleep and loose our grips of Christ; tribulation &amp; tentations will almost loose us at the root, &amp; yet without tribulations &amp; temptations we can now no more grow, then herbs or corn without rain. Sin &amp; Satan &amp; the World will say &amp; cry in our ear that we have a hard reckoning to make in Judgement, &amp; yet none of these three, except they lye, dare say in our face that our sin can change the Tenour of the new Covenant. Forward then, <hi>dear Brother,</hi> &amp; lose not your grip, hold fast the Truth, for the world sell not one dram weight of God's truth, especially now whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> most me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> measure Truth by time, like young sea-men setting their Compass by a cloud: For now Time is father &amp; mother to Truth in the thoughts &amp; practices of our evil Time.

               <p>I Have longed exceedingly to hear of your life &amp; health, &amp; growth in the grace of God. I lacked the opportunity of a bearer, in respect I did not understand of the hasty departure of the last, by whom I might have saluted your <hi>La:</hi> &amp; therefore I could not write before this time. I intreat you, <hi>Madam</hi> let me have two lines from you concerning your present condition: I know ye are in grief &amp; heaviness, &amp; if it were not so, ye might be afraid, because then your way should not be so like the way that our Lord saith, leadeth to the new <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> Sure I am, if ye knew what were before you or if ye saw but some glances of it, ye would with gladness swim through the present floods of sorrow, spreading forth your arms out of desire to be at land: If God have given you the earnest of the Spirit as part of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God's principal summe, ye have to rejoyce, for our Lord will not lose his earnest, neither will he goe back or repent him of the bargain. If ye finde at some time a longing to see God, joy in the assurance of that sight [howbeit that feast be but like the Passover that cometh about onely once a year] peace of conscience, liberty of prayer, the doors of God's trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure casten up to the soul; &amp; a clear sight of himself looking out &amp; saying with a smiling countenance, <hi>Welcome in to me, afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed soul;</hi> this is the earnest that he giveth sometimes, &amp; which maketh glad the heart, &amp; is an evidence that the bargain will hold: But to the end ye may get this earnest, it were good to come oft in terms of speech with God, both in prayer &amp; hearing of the word: For this is the house of wine, where ye meet with your Welbeloved, here it is where he kisseth you with the kisses of his mouth, and where ye feel the smell of his garments, and they have indeed a most fragrant &amp; glorious smell: Ye must, I say, wait upon him, &amp; be often communing with him whose lips are as lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrhe, &amp; by the mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof he will asswage your grief: for the Christ that saveth you is a speaking Christ, the Church knoweth him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.

Ioh.</hi> 17. 24. Amen; dear Jesus, let it be according to that word. I wonder that ever your heart should be casten down, if ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve this truth: &amp; they are not worthy of Jesus Christ, who will not suffer forty years troubles for him, since they have such glorious promises: But we fools beleeve these promises as the man that read <hi>Plato's</hi> writings concerning the immortality of the soul, so long as the book was in his hand, he beleeved all was true, &amp; that the Soul could not die; but so soon as he laid by the book, presently he began to imagine that the Soul is but a smoke or airy vapour that perisheth with the expiring of the breath: So we at starts doe assent to the sweet &amp; precious promises, but laying aside God's book we begin to call all in question: It is faith indeed to beleeve without a pledge &amp; to hold the heart constant at this work, &amp; when we doubt, to run to the Law &amp; to the Testimony &amp; stay there: <hi>Madam,</hi> hold you here, here is your father's Testament, read it, in it he hath left to you <hi>Remission of sins &amp; life everlasting</hi> If all that ye have here be crosses &amp; troubles, down-castings, frequent desertions, &amp; departure of the Lord, who is suiting you in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; courage, he who is wooer and suiter should not be an

If your <hi>La:</hi> be not changed (as I hope ye are not) I beleeve ye esteem your self to be of these whom God hath tried these many years &amp; refined as silver.

Know therefore that the best affected of the Ministery have thought it convenient &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary at such a time as this, that all who love the truth should joyn their prayers together, &amp; cry to God with humiliation &amp; fasting: The times which are agreed upon, are, the two first sabbaths of <hi>February</hi> next, &amp; the six dayes interveening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt these sabbaths, as they may conveniently be had, &amp; the first sabbath of every Quarter: And the Causes, as they are written to me, are these. 1.

The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable &amp; pitifull estate of a glorious Church [in so short a time, against so many bonds] in Doctrine, Sacraments &amp; Discipline, so sore persecuted, in the persons of faithfull Pastors and professors, and the door of God's house kept so strait, by Bastard-Porters, in so much, that worthy instruments, able for the work, are held at the door, the Rulers having turned over Religion into Policy, &amp; the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude ready to receive any Religion that shall be enjoyned by Authority. 3. In our Humiliation, besides that we are under a necessity of deprecating God's wrath, &amp; vowing to God sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely new obedience, the weakness, coldness, silence &amp; luke warmness of some of the best of the Ministery, &amp; the deadness of Professors, who have suffered the truth both secretly to be stoln away &amp; openly to be plucked from us, would be confessed. 4. Atheism, Idolatry, profanity &amp; vanity would be confessed: Our King's heart recommended to God, &amp; God intreated that he would stir up the Nobles &amp; the People to turn from their evil waves.

               <p>I Received your <hi>La;</hi> letter from I. G. I thank our Lord, ye are as well, at least as one may be, who is not come home: it is a mercy in this stormy sea to get a second wind, for none of the saints get a first, but they must take the winds as the Lord of the seas causeth them to blow, &amp; the Inne as the Lord &amp; Master of the Innes hath ordered it: if contentment were here, heaven were not heaven: Who ever seek the world to be their bed, shall at best finde it short &amp; ill made, &amp; a stone under their side to hold them waking rather then a soft pillow to sleep upon: Ye ought to bless your Lord that it is not worse: we live in a sea where many have suffered ship wrack, and have need that Christ sit at the helm of the ship: it is a mercy to win to heaven, though with much hard toil &amp; heavy labour, &amp; to take it by violence ill &amp; well as it may be: better goe swimming &amp; wet through our waters, then drown by the way; especially now when Truth suffereth, &amp; great men bid Christ sit lower &amp; contract himself in less bounds, as if he took too much room. I expect our new Prelate shall try my sitting: I hang by a threed, but it is (if I may speak so] of Christ's spinning, there is no quarrel more honest or honourable, then to suffer for truth: but the worst is, that this Kirk is like to
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:57570:262"/>
sink, &amp; all her lovers &amp; friends stand afar off, none mourn with her &amp; none mourn for her. But the Lord Jesus will not be put out of his conquest so soon in <hi>Scotland;</hi> it will be seen, the Kirk &amp; Truth will rise again within three dayes, &amp; Christ again shall ride upon his white horse, howbeit his horse seem now to stumble, yet he cannot fall: the fulness of Christ's harvest in the end of the earth is not yet come in. I speak not this because I would have it so, but upon better grounds then my naked liking: but enough of this sad subject. I long to be fully assured of your <hi>La:</hi> welfare &amp; that your soul prospereth, especially now in your so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary life, when your comforts outward are few, &amp; when Christ hath you for the very uptaking. I know, his love to you is still running over, &amp; his love hath not so bad a memory as to forget you, &amp; your dear childe, who hath two fathers in heaven, the one <hi>the Ancient of dayes:</hi> I trust in his mercy, he hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing laid up for him above, however it may goe with him here, I know it is long since your <hi>La:</hi> saw this world turned your step-mother &amp; did forsake you. <hi>Madam,</hi> ye have reason to take in good part a lean dinner &amp; spare diet in this life, seeing your large supper of the Lamb's preparing will recompense all. let it goe, which was never yours, but onely in sight, not in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty: the time of your loan will wear shorter &amp; shorter, &amp; <hi>time</hi> is measured to you by ounce-weights: &amp; then I know, your <hi>hope</hi> shall be a full ear of corn &amp; not blasted with wind: it may be your joy, that your anchor is up within the vail, &amp; that the ground it is cast upon, is not false but firm. God hath done his part, I hope ye will not deny to fish &amp; fetch home all your love to himself, &amp; it is but too narrow &amp; short for him, if it were more: if ye were before pouring all your love [if it had been many gallons more] in upon your Lord, if drops fell by in the in-pouring, he forgiveth you: he hath done now all that can be done, to win beyond it all, &amp; hath left little to wooe your love from himself, except one onely childe: what is his purpose herein, he knoweth best, who hath taken your soul in tutouring: Your faith may be boldly charitable of Christ, that however matters goe, the worst shall be <hi>a tired tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller,</hi> &amp; <hi>a joyfull &amp; sweet welcome-home:</hi> the back of your win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-night

               <p>GRace, mercy, &amp; peace be to you: It was not my part whom our Lord hath enlarged, to forget you his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner. When I consider how long your night hath been, I think Christ hath a minde to put you in free grace's debt, so much the deeper, as your sufferings have been of so long a continuance. But what if Christ minde you no jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I am sure, your joy bordering &amp; neighbouring with the joy of Christ's Bride, would be so much the sweeter that it were publike. I thought, if Christ had halved my mercies, and delivered his Bride and not me, that his praises should have been double to what they are: But now two rich mercies conjoyned in one have stoln from our Lord more then half-praises: Oh that mercy should so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile us, and steal away our counts and acknowledgements! <hi>Worthy Sir,</hi> I hope I need not exhort you to goe on, in hoping for the salvation of God: There hath not been so much taken from your time of ease &amp; created joyes, as Eternity shall adde to your heaven: Ye know when one day in heaven hath paved you, yea, &amp; overpayed your blood, bonds, sorrow &amp; suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that it would trouble Angels understanding to lay the count of that superplus of glory, which Eternity can &amp; will give you. O but your sand-glass of sufferings &amp; losses, cometh to little, when it shall be counted and compared with the glory that bideth you on the other side of the water! Ye have no leisure to rejoyce &amp; fing here while time goeth about you, &amp; where your Psalms will be short, therefore ye will think Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity

If the wisdom of Christ hath made you Antichrist's eye-sore &amp; his envy, ye are to thank God that such a piece of clay as ye are, is made the field of glory to work upon: it was the potter's aim that the clay should praise him, &amp; I hope it satisfieth you that your clay is for his glory. Oh who can suffer enough for such a Lord! &amp; who can lay out in bank enough of pain, shame, losses, tortures, to receive in again the free interest of eternall glory? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4: 17. O how advantagious a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining is it with such a rich Lord! If your hand &amp; pen had been at leisure to gain glory in paper, it had been but paper-glory: but the bearing of a publike cross so long for the now contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted priviledges of the crown &amp; scepter of free King Jesus, the Prince of the Kings of the earth, is glory booked in heaven. <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy &amp; dear Erother,</hi> if ye goe to weigh Jesus his sweetness, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, glory &amp; beauty, &amp; say fore-against him your ounces or drams of Suffering for him, ye shall be straitned two wayes. 1. It will be a pain to make the comparison, the disproportion being by no understanding imaginable: nay, if heaven's Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick &amp; Angels were set to work, they should never num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the degrees of difference. 2. It should straiten you to finde a scale for the ballance to lay that High &amp; Lofty One, that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>transcending Prince of excellency into: If your minde could fancy as many created heavens as time hath had minutes, trees have had leaves &amp; clouds have had rain drops, since the first stone of the creation was laid, they should not make half a scale to bear &amp; weight boundless excellency it to. And therefore the King whose marks ye are bearing &amp; whose dying ye carry about with you in your body, is out of all cry &amp; consideration beyond &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all our thoughts. For my self, I am content to feed upon wondering sometimes at the beholding but of the borders &amp; skirts

               <p>GRace, mercy &amp; peace be to you, from God our father &amp; our Lord Jesus Christ. Think it not strange, <hi>beloved in our Lord Iesus,</hi> that Satan can command keyes of prisons &amp; bolts &amp; chains; this is a piece of the Devil's Princedom that he hath over the world: interpret &amp; understand our Lord well in this: be not jealous of his love, though he make devils and men his under-servants to scour the rust off your faith &amp; purge you from your dross. And let me charge you, <hi>O prisoners of hope,</hi> to open your window &amp; to look out by faith, &amp; behold heavens post, that speedy &amp; swift salvation of God, that is coming to you; it is a broad river that faith will not look over; it is a mighty &amp; a broad sea that they of a lively hope cannot behold the furthest bank &amp; other shore thereof: Look over the water, your anchor is fixed within the vail, the one end of the cable is about the prisoner of Christ, &amp; the other is entred within the vail, whither the forerunner is entred for you, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6: 19, 20. It can goe straight thorow the flames of the fire of the wrath of men, devils, losses, tortures, death, and not a threed of it be either singed or burnt; men and devils have no teeth to bite it in two: Hold fast till he come: Your cross is of the colour of heaven &amp; Christ, &amp; pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented over with the faith &amp; comforts of the Lord's faithfull Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with <hi>Scotland;</hi> &amp; that dy &amp; colour will abide the foul weather, &amp; neither be stained nor cast the colour; yea it reflects a scad like the cross of Christ, whose holy hands, many a day lifted up to God praying for sinners, were fettered and bound, as if these blessed hands had stoln &amp; shed innocent

Oh, such a pair of sufferers and witnesses, as high and royal Jesus and a poor piece guilty clay marrowed together, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one yoke! O how lovely is the cross with such a second! I beleeve that your prison is enacted in God's court, not to keep you till your hope breath out it's life &amp; last: Your cross is under law to restore you again safe to your brethren &amp; sisters in Christ: take heaven and Christ's back-bond for a fair back-door out of your suffering. The Saviour is on his journey with salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and deliverance for mount <hi>Zion</hi> &amp; the sword of the Lord is drunk with blood and made fat with fatness, his sword is bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in heaven against <hi>Babylon,</hi> for it is the day of the Lord's vengeance and the year of recompences for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie of <hi>Zion:</hi> And perswade your selves, the streams of the rivers of <hi>Babylon</hi> shall be pitch, and the dust of the land brimstone and burning pitch, <hi>Isa.</hi> 34: 8. And if your deliverance be conjoyned with the deliverance of <hi>Zion,</hi> it shall be two salvations to you. It were good to be armed before hand for death or bodily tortures for Christ, and to think what a crown of honour it is, that God hath given you pieces of living clay to be tortured witnesses for saving truth, and that ye are so happy as to have some pints of blood to give out for the crown of that royal Lord, who hath caused you to avouch himself before men. If ye can lend fines of three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pound sterling for Christ, let heaven's register and Christ's count-book keep in reckoning your depursments for him: It shall be engraven &amp; printed in great letters upon heaven's throne, what you are willing to give for him: Christ's papers of that kinde cannot be lost or fall by. Doe not wonder to see clay boast the great potter, &amp; to see blinced men to threaten the Gospel with death &amp; burial &amp; to raze out Truth's name: but where will they make a grace for the Gospel &amp; the Lord's bride! Earth &amp; hell shall be but little bounds for their burial: lay all the clay &amp; rubbish of this inch of the whole earth above our Lord's spouse,

yet it will not cover her nor hold her down; she shall live &amp; not die, she shall behold the salvation of God. Let your faith frist God a little &amp; be not afraid for a smoking fire-brand: there is more smoke in Babylon's furnace then there is fire: till dooms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day shall come, they shall never see the <hi>Kirk of Scotland</hi> &amp; our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant burnt to ashes, or if it should be thrown in tho fire, yet it cannot be so burnt or buried, as not to have a resurrection: angry clay's wind shall shake none of Christ's corn; he will gather in all his wheat into his barn: onely let your fellowship with Christ be renewed: ye are sibber to Christ now when you are imprisoned for him, then before; for now the stroakes laid on you, doe come in remembrance before our Lord, &amp; he can owne his own wounds: a drink of Christ's love, which is better then wine, is the drink-silver which Suffering for his majesty leaves behinde it: it is not your sins which they persecute in you, but God's grace, &amp; loyalty to King Jesus: they see no treason in you to your Prince, the King of <hi>Britain,</hi> albeit they say so, but it is heaven in your that earth is fighting against, &amp; Christ is own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own cause: <hi>grace</hi> is a party that fire will not burn, not water drown: when they have eaten &amp; drunken you, their stomack shall be sick, &amp; they shall spue you out alive. O what glory is it to be suffering abjects, for the Lord's glory &amp; royalty! Nay, though his servants had a body to burn for ever, for this Gospel, so being that triumphing &amp; exalted Jesus his high glory did rise out, of these flames &amp; out of that burning body, Oh, what a sweet fire! O what soul-refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing torment should that be! What if the pickles of dust &amp; ashes of the burnt &amp; dissolved body, were musicians to sing his praises, &amp; the highness of that never-enough-exalted Prince of ages? O what love is it in him, that he will have such musicians as we are to tune that Psalm of his everlasting praises in heaven! Oh what shining &amp; burning flames of love are these, that Christ will divide his share of life, of heaven &amp; glory with you. <hi>Luk. 22. 29. Ioh. 17: 24. Rev.</hi> 3: 21. A part of his throne, one draught of his wine (his wine of glory &amp; life, that comes from under the throne of God &amp; of the Lamb) &amp; one apple of the tree of life will doe more then make up all the expences &amp; charges of clay, lent out for heaven.

Oh! Oh but we have short &amp; narrow &amp; creeping thoughts of Jesus, &amp; doe but shape Christ in our conceptions according to some created portraiture! O Angels, lend in your help to make love-books &amp; songs of our fair &amp; white &amp; ruddy standard-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er amongst ten thousand! O heavens! O heaven of heavens! O glorified tennants &amp; triumphing house-holders with the Lamb, put in new Psalms &amp; love-sonnets of the excellency of our bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom &amp; help us to set him on high!

O fairness of creatures, blush be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his uncreated beauty! O created strength, be amazed to stand before your strong Lord of hosts! O created love, think shame of thy self before this unparalleled love of heaven! O angel-wisdom, hide thy self before our Lord whose understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing passeth finding out! O sun in thy shining beauty, for shame put on a web of darkness &amp; cover thy self before thy brightest master &amp; maker! O who can adde glory by doing or suffering, to this never-enough-admired and praised lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er! Oh we can but bring our drop to this sea, and our can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, dim and dark as it is, to this clear and lightsom sun of heaven and earth! Oh but we have cause to drink ten deaths in one cup dry, to swim through ten seas, to be at that <hi>land of praises,</hi> where we shall see that wonder of wonders &amp; enjoy this jewel of heavens jewels! O death, doe thy out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most against us! O torments! O malice of men &amp; devils, waste thy-strength on the witnesses of our Lord's testament! O devils, bring hell to help you in tormenting the followers of the Lamb! we will defie you to make us too soon happy, &amp; to waft us too soon over the water to the land where the noble plant, <hi>the plant of venown</hi> groweth. O cruel Time, that torments us &amp; sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends our dearest enjoyments that we wait for, when we shall be bathed &amp; steeped, soul &amp; body, down in the depths of this love of loves! O Time, I say, run fast! O motions, mend your pace! O Welbeloved, be like a young Roe upon the mountains of Separations! Post, post; &amp; hasten our desired &amp; hungered-for meeting: love is sick to hear tell of <hi>to morrow.</hi>

And what then can come wrong to you, <hi>O honourable witnesses of his Kingly truth?</hi> Men have no more of you to work upon, but some few inches and span-lengths of fick, coughing and flegmatick clay: your spirits are above their benches, courts, or High Commissions: your souls, your love to Christ, your faith, cannot be summoned not sentenced nor accused nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by <hi>Pope, Deputy, Prelat, Ruler</hi> or <hi>Tyrant:</hi> your faith is a free Lord, &amp; cannot be a captive: all the malice of hell &amp; earth, can but hurt the scabbard of a beleever: &amp; death at the worst can get but a clay-pawne in keeping till your Lord make the King's keys &amp; open your graves. Therefore upon luck's head [as we use to say] take your sill of his love, and let a post way or a causey be laid betwixt your prison and heaven, and goe up &amp; visit your treasure: Enjoy your Beloved &amp; dwell upon his love, till Eternity come in Time's room &amp; possess you of your eternal happiness: Keep your love to Christ, lay up your faith in heaven's keeping; &amp; follow the chief of the house of the Martyrs, that witnessed a fair confession before <hi>Pontius Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late;</hi> your cause and his is all one. The opposers of his cause are like drunken Judges &amp; transported, who in their cups would make Acts &amp; Lawes in their drunken courts, that the Sun should not rise and shine on the earth, and send their Officers &amp; Purse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to charge the Sun and Moon to give no more light to the world, &amp; would enact in their Court-bookes that the Sea after once ebbing should never flow again: But would not the Sun &amp; Moon &amp; Sea break these Acts &amp; keeep their Creator's direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

I beleeve your ashes, if ye were burnt for this cause, shall praise him: For the wrath of men &amp; their malice shall make a psalm to praise the Lord, <hi>Psal.</hi> 76: 10. &amp; therefore stand still &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold &amp; see what the Lord is to doe for this Island; <hi>his work is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> Deut. 32: 4. the nations have not seen the last end of his work; his end is more fair &amp; more glorious then the beginning. Ye have more honour then ye can be able to guide well, in that your bonds are made heavy for such an honourable cause. The seals of a controlled Gospel, &amp; the seals by bonds &amp; blood &amp; sufferings, are not committed to every ordinary professour. Some that would back Christ honestly in summer-time, would but spill the beauty of the Gospel, if they were put to suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And therefore let us beleeve, that wisdom dispenseth to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one here as he thinks good who bears them up that bear the cross: &amp; since our Lord hath put you to that part which was the flower of his own sufferings, we all expect that as ye have in the strength of our Captain begun, so ye will goe on without faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Providence maketh use of men &amp; devils for the refining of all the vessels of God's house, small &amp; great, &amp; for doing of two works at once in you, both for smothing of a stone to make it take bond with Christ in <hi>Ierusalem's</hi> wall, &amp; for witnessing to the glory of this reproached &amp; born down Gospel, which cannot die though hell were made a grave about it.

Keep your intelligence betwixt you &amp; heaven, &amp; your court with Christ: he hath in heaven the keyes of your prison, &amp; can set you at liberty when he pleaseth: His rich grace support you.

               <p>GRace, mercy &amp; peace be multiplied upon you: I bless our rich &amp; onely wise Lord, who careth so for his new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he is going over it again &amp; trying every piece in you, &amp; blowing away the motes of his new work in you. Alas! I am not so fit a Physician as your disease requireth: sweet, sweet, lovely Jesus be your Physician, where his under-Chirurgians cannot doe any thing for putting in order the wheels, paces, &amp; goings of a marred soul. I have little time; but yet the Lord
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:57570:275"/>
hath made me so concern my self in your condition that I dow not, I dare not be altogether silent. <hi>First,</hi> ye doubt from. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13: 5. whether ye be in Christ or not, &amp; so whether ye be a reprobate or not? I answer three things to the doubt. 1. Ye ow charity to all men, but most of all, to lovely &amp; loving Jesus, &amp; some also to your self, especiall to your renewed <hi>self;</hi> because your new <hi>self</hi> is not yours but another Lord's, even the work of his own Spirit: therefore to slander his work is to wrong himself: Love thinketh no evil: if ye love Grace, think not ill of Grace in your self; and ye think ill of Grace in your self, when ye make it but a bastard and a work of nature: for a holy fear that ye be not Christ's, and withall a care and a desire to be his &amp; not your own, is not, nay cannot be bastard nature. The great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate pleadeth hard for you, be upon the Advocate's side, O poor feared client of Christ! stay &amp; side with such a lover, who pleadeth for no other man's goods but his own [for he, if I may say so, scorneth to be enriched with an unjust con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest] and yet he pleadeth for you, whereof your letter [though too too full of jealousie] is a proof: for if ye were not his, your thoughts, which I hope are but the suggestion of his Spirit (that onely bringeth the matter in debate to make it sure to you) would not be such nor so serious as these, <hi>am I his?</hi> or <hi>whose am I?</hi> 2. Dare ye forswear your owner, and say in cold blood, <hi>I am not his?</hi> what nature or corruption saith at starts in you, I regard not: your thoughts of your self, when sin and guiltiness round you in the ear, and when ye have a sight of your deservings, are <hi>Apocrypha</hi> and not <hi>Scripture,</hi> I hope. Hear what the Lord saith of you, <hi>he will speak peace:</hi> if your Master say, I <hi>quite you,</hi> I shall then bid you eat ashes for bread and drink waters of gall and wormwood. But howbeit Christ out of his own mouth should seem to say, I <hi>came not for thee,</hi> as he did <hi>Matth.</hi> 15: 24. yet let me say, The words of tempting Jesus are not to be stretched as Scripture beyond his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, seeing his intention in speaking them is to strengthen, not to deceive: &amp; therefore here Faith may contradict what Christ seemeth at first to say, and so may ye. I charge you by the mercies of God, be not that cruel to Grace and the
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:57570:276"/>
new birth as to cast water on your own coal by misbelief: If ye must die (as I know ye shall not) it were a folly to slay your self. 3. I hope ye love the new birth &amp; a claim to Christ, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit ye dow not make it good: &amp; if ye were in hell &amp; saw the heavenly face of lovely, ten thousand times lovely <hi>Iesus,</hi> that hath God's hew and God's fair, fair and comely red and white wherewith it is beautified beyond comparison and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, ye could not forbear to say, Oh! if I could but blow a kiss from my sinfull mouth, from hell up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yen upon his cheeks, that are as <hi>a bed of spices as sweet flowers, Cant.</hi> 5: 13. I hope ye dare say, O fairest sight of heaven! O boundless mass of crucified &amp; slain love for me, give me leave to wish to love thee! O flower and bloom of heaven &amp; earth's love! O Angels wonder! O thou the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's eternally sealed love! &amp; O thou God's old delight! give me leave to stand beside thy love &amp; look in &amp; wonder, &amp; give me leave to wish to love thee, if I can doe no more. 2. We being born in atheism &amp; bairns of the house that we are come off, it is no new thing, <hi>my dear Brother,</hi> for us to be under jealousies &amp; mistakes about the love of God: what think ye of this that the man <hi>Christ</hi> was tempted to beleeve there were but two Persons in the blessed Godhead, &amp; that the Son of God, the substantial, &amp; coerernal Son, was not the lawfull Son of God? Did not Satan say, <hi>If thou be the Son of God?</hi> 3. Ye say that ye know not what to doe? Your Head said once that same word or not far from it, <hi>Ioh. 12. 27. Now is my soul troubled, &amp; what shall I say?</hi> &amp; faith answered Christ's <hi>What shall I say?</hi> with these words, <hi>O tempted Saviour, askest thou</hi> What shall I say? <hi>say, pray, Father save me from this hour.</hi> What course can ye take but pray &amp; first Christ his own comforts? He is no dyvour, take his word. Oh [say ye] I cannot pray! <hi>Ans.</hi> Honest sighing is faith breathing &amp; whispering him in the ear: the life is not out of faith, where there is sighing, looking up with the eyes &amp; breathing towards God, <hi>Eam. 3: 36. Hide not thine ear at my breathing.</hi> But what shall I doe in spiritual exercis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, say ye? <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. If ye knew particularly what to doe, it were not a spiritual exercise. 2. In my weak judgement, ye would
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:57570:276"/>
first say, <hi>I will lorifie God in beleeving David's Salvation &amp; the Bride's Marriage with the Lamb, &amp; love the Church's stain hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, although I cannot for the present beleeve mine own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> 3. Say, <hi>I will not pass from my claim, suppose Christ would pass from his claim to me, it shall not goe back upon my side; howbeit my love to him be not worth a drink of water, yet Christ shall have it such as it is.</hi> 4. Say, <hi>I shall rather spill twenty prayers then not pray at all; let my broken words goe up to heaven: when they come up into the great Angel's golden censer, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passianat Advocate will put together my broken prayers &amp; perfume them:</hi> Words are but Accidents of Prayer. Oh [say y] I am slain with hardness of heart; &amp; troubled with confused and melancholious thoughts? <hi>Ans.</hi> My <hi>dear Brother,</hi> What would ye conclude thence, that ye know not well who ought you? I grant, <hi>Oh my heart is hard! Oh my thoughts of faithless sorrow!</hi> Ergo, <hi>I know not who ought me;</hi> were good Logick in heaven amongst Angels &amp; the glorified: but down in Christ's Hospital, where sick and distempered souls are under cure, it is not worth a straw. Give Christ time to end his work in your heart: hold on in feeling &amp; bewailing your hardness, for that is softness to feel hardness. 2. I charge you to make Psalms of Christ's praises for his begun work of Grace, make Christ your Musick &amp; your song, for Complaining &amp; feeling of want doeth often swallow up your Praises. What think ye of these who goe to hell, never trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with such thoughts? If your exercise be the way to hell, God help me; I have a cold coal to blow at, and a blank paper for heaven: I give you Christ caution, &amp; my heaven surety for your Salvation. Lend Christ your Melancholy; for Satan hath no right to make a chamber in your Melancholy; borrow joy &amp; comfort from the Comforter; bid the Spirit doe his office in you: &amp; remember, that <hi>faith</hi> is one thing, and the <hi>feeling &amp; notice of faith</hi> another: God forbid that <hi>feeling</hi> were <hi>Proprium quarto modo</hi> to all the Saints, &amp; that this were good reasoning, <hi>No feeling, no grace:</hi> I am sure ye were not alwayes these twenty years by-past, actually knowing that ye live, yet all this time ye are living: so is it with the life of faith. But Alas! <hi>Dear Brother,</hi> it is easie for me to speak

words &amp; syllables of peace, but <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 19. telleth you, <hi>I create peace:</hi> there is but one Creator, ye know: O that ye may get a Letter of peace sent you from heaven!

               <p>I Received your La: letter: but because I was still going through the countrey for the affairs of the Church, I have had no time to answer it. I had never more cause to fear then I have now, when my Lord hath restored me to my second crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted heaven on earth, &amp; hath turned my apprehended fears into joyes and great deliverance to his Church, whereof I have my share and part. Alas that weeping prayers answered and sent back from heaven with joy, should not have laughing prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses! O that this land would repent and lay burthens of praises upon the top of fair mount Zion. <hi>Madam,</hi> except this land be humbled, a Reformation is rather my wonder, then belief at this time: but surely it must be a wonder, and what is done already is a wonder: our Lord must restore beauty to his Churches without hire; for we were sold without money, and now our buyers repent them of the bargain, and would gladly give again better cheap then they bought us: they devoured <hi>Iacob</hi> and eat up his people as bread; now <hi>Iacob</hi> is grown a living childe in their womb, and they would fain be delivered of the childe and render the birth: Our Lord shall be midwife. O that this land be not like <hi>Ephraim an unwise son, that stayeth too long in the place of breaking forth of children!</hi> Your La: is blessed with children who are honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to build up Christ's waste places again: I beleeve your La: will think them well bestowed on that work, and that
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:57570:277"/>
                  <hi>Zion's</hi> beauty is your joy, this is a mark and evidence for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven which helpeth weak ones to hold their grip when other marks fail them. I hope your La: is at a good understanding with Christ, and that, as becometh a Christian, ye take him up aright [for many mistake and misshape Christ] in his comings and goings: Your wants and falls proclaim ye have nothing of your own but what ye borrow (nay, your <hi>self</hi> is not your <hi>own)</hi> but Christ hath given himself to you: Put Christ to the bank and heaven shall be your interest and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: Love him, for ye cannot over-love him: Take up your house in Christ, let him dwell in you and abide ye in him, &amp; then ye may look out of Christ and laugh at the clay-heavens that the sons of men are seeking after in this side of the water. Christ mindeth to make your losses grace's great advantage: Christ will lose nothing of you, nay, not your sins, for he hath an use for them aswell as for your service, howbeit ye are to loath your self for these. I hope ye fetch all the heaven ye have here in this life, from that which is up above, and that your anchor is casten as high and deep as Christ: O but it's far &amp; many a mile to his bottom! If I had known long since as I doe now (though still, alas! I am ignorant) what was in Christ, I would not have been so late in starting to the gate to seek him. O what can I doe or say to him who hath made the North render me back again! A grave is no sure prison to him for the keeping of dry bones. Woe's me that my foolish sorrow and unbelief being on horse-back did ride so produly &amp; witlesly over my Lord's Providence: but when my Faith was asleep, Christ was awake, &amp; now when I am awake I say he did all things well. O infinite wisdom! O incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable loving kindness! Alas that the heart I have is so little &amp; worthless for such a Lord as Christ is! O what oddes finde the saints in hard trials, when they feel sap at their roots, betwixt them and sun-burnt withered professors: crosses and storms cause them to cast their blooms and leaves: poor worldlings what will ye doe when the span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>length of your forenoon's laughter is ended and when the weeping side of Providence is turned to you? I

put up all the favours ye have bestowed on my Brother upon Christ's score, in whose book are many such counts &amp; who will requite them. I wish you to be builded more and more upon the stone laid in Zion &amp; then ye shall be the more fit to have a hand in rebuilding our Lord's fallen tabernacle in this land, in which ye shall finde great peace when ye come to grips with Death the King of terrouis.

               <p>GRace, mercy &amp; peace be to you: The necessary impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of my calling have hitherto kept me from making a return to your letter, the heads whereof I shall now briefly ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. As. 1. I approve your going to the fountain, when your own Cisterne is dry: A difference there must be betwixt Christ's well &amp; your borrowed water, &amp; why but ye have need of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiness &amp; drving up, aswell as ve have need of the well? want &amp; a hole there must be in our vessel, to leave room to Christ's art; his well hath it's own need of thirsty drinkers, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend infinite love, which from eternity did brew such a cellar of living waters for us. Ye commend his free love; &amp; it's well done: Oh if I could help you, &amp; if I could be master-conveen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to gather an earth-full &amp; an heaven-full of tongues dipped and steeped in my Lord's well of love or his wine of love, even tongues drunken with his love, to raise a song of praises to him, betwixt the East &amp; West-end &amp; furthest points of the broad hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens! If I were in your case [as alas! my dry &amp; dead heart is not now in that garden] I would borrow leave to come &amp; stand
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:57570:278"/>
upon the banks &amp; coasts of that sea of love, &amp; be a feasted soul to see Love's fair tide, free Love's high and lofty waves, each of them higher then ten earths, flowing in upon pieces of lost clay: O welcome, welcome, great sea! O if I had as much love for wideness and breadth, as twenty outmost shells and spheres of the heaven of heavens, that I might receive in a little flood of his free love! Come, come, <hi>dear Friend,</hi> &amp; be pained that the King's wine-cellar of free love &amp; his ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting house [O so wide, so stately! O so God-like, so glory-like!] should be so abundant, so overflowing, &amp; your shallow vessel so little to take in some part of that love: but since it cannot come in you for want of room, enter your self in this sea of love, &amp; breath under these waters, &amp; die of love, &amp; live as one dead &amp; drowned of this Love. But why doe ye complain of waters going over your soul, &amp; that the smoke of the terrors of a wrathfull Lord, doeth almost suffocate you &amp; bring you to death's brink? I know the fault is in your eyes, not in him; its not the rock that fleeth &amp; moveth, but the green sailer: if your sense &amp; apprehension be made judge of his love, there is a graven image made presently, even a changed God &amp; a foe-God, who was once <hi>[when ye washed your steps with butter, &amp; the rock poured you out rivers of oyl, Iob.</hi> 29. 6.] a friend-God: either now or never let God work; ye had never since ye was a man, such a fair field for faith: for a painted hell &amp; an apprehension of wrath in your father, is faith's opportunity to try what strength is in it: now give God as large a measure of charity as ye have of sorrow; now see faith to be faith indeed, if ye can make your grave betwixt Christ's feet, &amp; say, <hi>Though he should flay me, I will trust in him; his beleeved love shall be my winding-sheet, &amp; all my grave-cloaths; I shall roll &amp; sowe in my soul, my slain soul, in that web, his sweet &amp; free love:</hi> &amp; let him write upon my grave <hi>Here lieth a beleeving dead man, breathing out and making an hole in death's broad side, &amp; the breath of faith cometh forth through the hole.</hi> See now if ye can overcome &amp; prevail with God, &amp; wrestle God's tempting to death &amp; quit out of breath, as that renowned wrestler did, <hi>Hos 12. 3. And by his strength he had power with God.</hi> v. 4. <hi>Yea
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:57570:279"/>
he had power over the Angel &amp; prevailed.</hi> He is a strong man indeed who overmatcheth heaven's strength and the holy One of <hi>Israel,</hi> the strong Lord: which is done by a secret supply of divine strength within, wherewith the weakest being strengthned, overcome and conquer. It shall be great victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to blow out the flame of that furnace yeare now in, with the breath of faith: &amp; when hell, men, malice, cruelty, fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, Devils, the seeming glooms of a sweet Lord, meet you in the teeth, if ye then as a captive of Hope, as one fettered in Hope's prison, run to your strong hold, even from God glooming to God glooming, &amp; beleeve the salvation of the Lord in the dark, which is your onely victory: your enemies are but pieces of malitious clay, they shall die as men &amp; be confounded. But that your troubles are many at once, &amp; ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows come in from all airths, from countrey, friends, wife, children, foes, estate, &amp; right down from God who is the hope &amp; stay of your soul, I confess is more &amp; very heavy to be born; yet all these are not more then Grace, all these bits of coals casten in your sea of mercy cannot dry it up: your troubles are many &amp; great, yet not an ounce-weight beyond the measure of infinite wisdom, I hope, not beyond the measure of grace that he is to bestow; for our Lord never yet brake the back of his childe, nor spilt his own work: nature's plastering &amp; counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit work he doeth often break in sheards, &amp; putteth out a candle not lighted at the Sun of righteousness; but he must cherish his own reeds &amp; handle them softly, never a reed getteth a thrust with the Mediator's hand to lay together the two ends of the reed. O what bonds &amp; ligaments hath our Chirurgion of broken spirits, to binde up all his lame &amp; bruised ones with! cast your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynted spirit in his lap, &amp; lay your burden upon one who is so willing to take your cares &amp; your fears off you, &amp; to exchange &amp; niffer your crosses, &amp; to give you new for old &amp; gold for iron, even to give you garments of praise for the spirit of heaviness. It's true in a great part what ye write of this Kirk, that the letter of Religion onely is reformed &amp; scarce that: I doe not beleeve out Lord will build his <hi>Zion</hi> in this land, upon this skin of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:

so long as our scum remaineth &amp; our heart-idols are keeped, this work must be at a stand; and therefore our Lord must yet sift this land and search us with candles; and I know, he shall give and not sell us his Kingdom: his Grace and our remaining guiltiness must be compared, &amp; the one must be seen in the glory of it and the other in the sinfulness of it: But I desire to beleeve and would gladly hope to see, that the glancing and shining luster of glory, coming from the diamonds and stones set in the crown of our Lord Jesus, shall cast rayes and beams many thousand miles about. I hope Christ is upon a great Marriage, and that his wooing and suting of his excellent Bride, doeth take it's beginning from us the ends of the earth. O what joy and what glory would I judge it, if my heaven should be suspended, till I might have leave to run on foot, to be a witness of that Marriage-glory, &amp; see Christ put on the glory of his last married Bride and his last Marriage-love on earth, when he shall enlarge his love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and set it upon the top of the mountains, and take in the elder Sister, the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and the fulness of the <hi>Gentiles!</hi> It were heaven's honour &amp; glory upon earth, to be his lackey to run at his horse-foot and hold up the train of his Marriage-robe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>royal, in the day of our high a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

upon Christ, put on his own mask upon his face, and not your vail made of unbelief, which speaketh, as if he borrowed love to you, from you and your demerits &amp; sinfull deservings. Oh no! Christ is man, but he is not like man; he hath man's love in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but it is lustered with God's love, &amp; it is very God's love, ye have to doe with: When your wheels goe about, he standeth still: Let God be <hi>God</hi> and be ye a <hi>man,</hi> and have ye the deserving of <hi>man</hi> &amp; the sin of one who hath suffered your Welbeloved to slip away, nay hath refused him entrance, when he was knocking till his head and locks were frozen: Yet what is that to him? his book keepeth your name, and is not printed and reprinted and changed and corrected: And why but he should goe to his place &amp; hide himself? Howbeit his Departure be his own good work, yet the belief of it in that manner is your sin: But wait on till he return with Salvation and cause you rejoyce in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end. It is not much to complain: but rather beleeve then complain, and sit in the dust and close your mouth, till he make your sown light grow again; for your afflictions are not eternal, Time will end them, &amp; so shall ye at length see the Lord's salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: his love sleepeth not, but is still in working for you, his Salvation will not tarry nor linger, &amp; Suffering for him is the noblest cross that is out of heaven: Your Lord had the waile &amp; choice of ten thousand other crosses beside this, to exercise you withall; but his wisdom &amp; his love wailed and choosed out this for you, beside them all, &amp; take it as a choice one, &amp; make use of it, so, as ye look to this world as your step-mother in your bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed prison: For it is a love-look to heaven and the other side of the water, that God seeketh: &amp; this is the fruit, the flower &amp; bloom growing out of your cross, that ye be a dead man to time, to clay, to gold, to countrey, to friends, wife, children, &amp; all pieces of created nothings, for in them there is not a seat nor bottom for your soul's love. O what room is for your Love [if it were as broad as the sea] up in heaven and in God! and what would not Christ give for your love? God gave so much for your soul, &amp; blessed are ye, if ye have a love for him &amp; can call in your soul's love from all idols, and can make a God of God, a God of Christ &amp; draw a line betwixt your heart and him. If

your deliverance come not, Christ's presence and his beleeved love must stand as caution and surety for your deliverance, till your Lord send it in his blessed time: for Christ hath many Salvations, if we could see them: and I would think it better born comfort and joy that cometh from the faith of deliverance and the faith of his love, then that which cometh from deliverance it self. It is not much matter, if ye finde ease to your afflicted soul, what be the means, either of your own wishing, or of God's choosing; the latter I am sure is best and the comfort strongest and sweetest: let the Lord absolutely have the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your evils &amp; troubles, and put them off you by recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending your cross and your furnace to him, who hath skill to melt his own mettall and knoweth well what to doe with his surnace: let your heart be willing that God's fire have your tin and brass and dross: to consent to want corruption is a greater mercy then many professors doe well know, and to refer the manner of God's Physick to his own wisdom, whither it be by drawing blood, or giving sugared drinks that cure sick folks without pain, it is a great point of faith; and to beleeve Christ's cross to be a friend as he himself is a friend, is also a special act of faith: but when ye are over the water, this case shall be a yes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday past an hundred years ere ye were born, &amp; the cup of glory shall wash the memory of all this away and make it as nothing: Onely now take Christ in with you under your yoke, and let patience have her perfect work, for this haste is your infimity. The Lord is rising up to doe you good in the latter end, put on the faith of his salvation &amp; see him posting &amp; hasting towards you. <hi>Sir,</hi> my employments being so great, hinder me to write at more length excuse me: I hope to be mindfull of you.

jealouse of your heavenly husband's love, yet it is a sinful sign: as there be some happy sins [If may speak so] not of themselves but because they are neighboured with faith and love: and so, <hi>worthy Lady,</hi> I would have you hold by this that the ancient love of an old husband standeth firm and sure, and let faith hing by this small threed, that he loved you before he laid the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-stone of the world, &amp; therefore, he cannot change his minde because he is God, and rests in his love; neither is sin in you, a good reason wherefore ye should doubt of him, or think because sin hath put you in the courtesie and reverence of justice, that therefore he is wroth with you: Neither is it presumption in you to lay the burden of your salvation upon one mighty to save; so being ye lay aside all confidence in your self-worth &amp; righteousness. True faith is humble &amp; seeth no way to escape but onely in Christ: And I beleeve ye have put an esteem &amp; high price upon Christ: &amp; they cannot but beleeve, &amp; so be saved, who love Christ and to whom he is precious: for the love of Christ hath chosen Christ as a lover, &amp; it were not like God, if ye should chuse him as your liking &amp; he not chuse you again, nay he hath prevented you in that, for ye have not chosen him but he hath chosen you.

               <p>GRace be to you: I doe unwillingly write unto you of that which God hath done concerning your son in law; onely, I beleeve ye look not below Christ and the higest and most supream act of providence, which moveth all wheels: And certainly what came down enacted &amp; concluded in the great book before the throne, &amp; signed &amp; subscribed with the hand which never did wrong, should be kissed &amp; adored by us: we see God's decrees, when they bring forth their fruits, all actions, good &amp; ill, sweet &amp; sowre in their time; But we see not presently the after-birth of God's decree, <hi>to wit,</hi> his blessed end &amp; the good that he bringeth out of the womb of his holy &amp; spotless counsel: we see his working, &amp; we sorrow: The end of his counsel &amp; working lieth hidden &amp; underneath the ground, &amp; therefore we cannot beleeve: Even amongst men, we see hewen stones, timber &amp; an hundred scattered parcels &amp; pieces of an house, all under-tools, hammers &amp; axes &amp; saws; yet the house, the beauty &amp; ease of so many lodgings &amp; ease-rooms, we neither see nor understand for the present: these are but in the minde &amp; head of the builder as yet: wee see red earth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken clods, furrows &amp; stones; but we see not summer-lilies, roses, &amp; the beauty of a garden: If ye give the Lord time to work [as often he that beleeveth not, maketh haste, but not speed] his end is under the ground, &amp; ye shall see it was your good that your Son hath changed dwelling-places, but not his Master: Christ thought good to have no more of his service here, yet <hi>Rev. 22: 3. His servants shall serve him:</hi> He needeth not us or our service, either in earth or in heaven: But ye are to look to him, who giveth the hireling both his leave &amp; his wages for his naked aim &amp; purpose to serve Christ, as well as for his labours: It is put up in Christ's account, such a labourer did sweat fourty years in Christ's vineyard, howbeit he got not leave to labour so long, because he who accepteth of the <hi>will</hi> for the <hi>deed,</hi> counteth so: None can teach the Lord to lay an

But I hope ye have learned that much of Christ, as not to look to wheels rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led round about on earth: Earthen vessels are not to dispute with their Former: peices of sinning-clay may by reasoning &amp; contending with the Potter, mar the work of him, who hath his fire in Zion and his furnace in Jerusalem, as bullocks sweating &amp; wrestling in the furrow make their yoke more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie: In quietness &amp; rest ye shall be saved: If men doe any thing contrary to our heart, we may ask both <hi>who did it?</hi> And <hi>what is done?</hi> And <hi>why?</hi> When God hath done any such thing we are to enquire <hi>who hath done it?</hi> And to know that this cometh from the Lord, who is wonderfull in counsel: but we are not to ask <hi>what?</hi> or <hi>why?</hi> If it be from the Lord [as certainly their is no evil in the city without him <hi>Amos.</hi> 3. 6.] it is enough the fairest face of his spotless way is but coming, &amp; ye are to beleeve his works aswell as his word. Violent death is a sharer with Christ in his death, which was violent: it maketh not much what way we goe to heaven: the happie home is all, where the roughness of the way shall be forgotten: He is gone home to a friend's house and made welcome, and the race is ended: Time is recompensed with eternity, and copper with gold: God's order is in wisdom, the husband goes home before the wife, and the throng of the marker shall be over ere it be

long, and another generation where we now are, and at length an emptie house, and not one of mankinde shall be upon the earth within the sixth part of an hour after the earth and the works that are therein shall be burnt up with fire: I fear more that Christ is about to remove when he carrieth home so much of his plenishing before hand: we cannot teach the Almighty knowledge: when he was directing the bullet against his servant, to fetch out the soul, no wise man could cry to God, <hi>Wrong, wrong Lord, for he is thine own:</hi> There is no mist over his eyes who is wonderfull in counsel: If Zion be builded with your son in law's blood, the Lord [deep in counsel] can glew together the stones of Zion with blood, and with that blood which is precious in his eyes: Christ hath fewer labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in his vineyard then he had; but some moe witnesses for his cause and the Lord's <hi>Covenant</hi> with the three Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. What is Christ's gain is not your loss: Let not that which is his holy and wise will be your unbeleeving sorrow: Though I really judge I had interest in his dead servant; yet because he now liveth to Christ, I quite the hops I had of his succesfull labouring in the ministery: I know he now praiseth the grace that he was to preach: And if there were a better thing on his head now in heaven then a crown, or any thing more excellent then heaven, he would cast it down before his feet, who sitteth on the throne: Give glory therefore to Christ as he now doeth, and say, <hi>Thy will be done.</hi> The grace and consolation of Christ be with you.</p>

               <p>IT may be I have been too long silent, but I hope ye will not impute it to forgetfulness of you. As I have heard of the death of your daughter with heaviness of minde on your behalf, so am I much comforted, that she hath evidenced to your self &amp; other witnesses, the hope of the resurrection of the dead: as sown corn is not lost [for there is more hope of that which is sown, then of that which is eaten. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 42.] so also is it in the resurrection of the dead; the body is sown in corruption, it is raised in incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; it is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory. I hope ye wait for the crope &amp; harvest, 1 <hi>Thess. 4. 14. For if we beleeve that Iesus died &amp; rose again, even so also them which sleep in Iesus will God bring with him:</hi> then they are not lost who are gathered in to that Congregation of the first-born &amp; the General Assembly of the Saints: though we cannot outrun nor overtake them that are gone before, yet we shall quickly follow them, &amp; the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is, that she hath the advantage of some moneths or years of the Crown, before you &amp; her mother: &amp; we doe not take it ill, if our children outrun us in the life of grace, why then are we sad if they outstrip us in the attainment of the life of glory? It would seem that there is more reason to grieve that childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> live behinde us, then that they are glorified &amp; die before us: all the difference is in some poor hungry accidents of-time, less or more, sooner or later: so the godly childe, though young, died of an hundred years old: &amp; ye could not now have bestowed her better, though the choise was Christ's, not yours: &amp; I am sure, <hi>Sir,</hi> ye cannot now say, she is married against the will of her parents; she might more readily, if alive, fall in the hand of a worse husband, but can ye think that she could have fallen in the hands of one better? and if Christ marry with your house, it is your honour not any cause of grief, that Jesus should portion any of yours ere she enjoy your portion, is it not great love? the patrimony is more then any other could give as good a husband
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:57570:293"/>
is unpossible; to say <hi>a better,</hi> is blasphemy. The King &amp; Prince of ages can keep them better then ye can doe: while she was alive, ye could intrust her to Christ &amp; recommend her to his keeping, now by an after-faith ye have resigned her unto him, in whose bosom doe sleep all that are dead in the Lord: ye would havelent her to glorifie the Lord upon earth, &amp; he hath borrowed her [with promise to restore her again, 1 <hi>Cor. 15: 53. 1 Thess.</hi> 4: 15. 16:] to be an organ of the immediate glorifying of himself in heaven: sinless glorifying of God is better then sinfull glorifying of him. And sure your prayers concerning her are fulfilled: I shall desire, if the Lord shall be pleased the same way to dispose of her mother, that ye have the same minde: Christ cannot multiply injuries upon you, if the fountain be the love of God (as I hope it is) ye are enriched with losses. Ye know all I can say, better, before I was in Christ, then I can express it. Grace be with you.</p>

               <p>GRace, mercy &amp; peace be to you: If Death, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you &amp; us all, were any other thing but a friendly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, &amp; a change, not a destruction of Life, it would seem a hard voyage to goe through such a sad &amp; dark trance, <hi>so thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a valley,</hi> as is the wages of sin: but I am confident, the way ye know, though your foot never trode in that black shadow: the loss of life is gain to you: if Christ Jesus be the period, the end &amp; lodging-home at the end of your journey, there is no fear ye goe to a friend: &amp; since ye have had a communion with him in this life, &amp; he hath a pawne &amp; pledge of yours, even the largest share of your love &amp; heart, ye may look Death in the face with joy: If the heart be in heaven, the remnant of you cannot be kept the prisoner of the second Death. But though he be the same Christ in the other life, ye found him to be
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:57570:294"/>
here, yet he is so far in his excellency, beauty, sweetness, ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiations &amp; beams of Majesty, above what he appeared here, when he is seen as he is, that ye shall misken him, &amp; he shall appear a new Christ, &amp; his kisses, breathings, embracements, the perfume; the oyntment of his name poured out on you, shall appear to have more of God, &amp; a stronger smell of heaven, of eternity, of a Godhead, of Majesty &amp; glory there, then here: As water at the fountain, apples in the orchard &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side the tree, have more of their native sweetness, taste &amp; beauty, then when transported to us some hundred miles. I mean not that Christ can lose any of his sweetness in the carrying, or that he in his Godhead and lovileness of presence, can be changed to the worse, betwixt the little spot of the earth ye are in, and the right hand of the father far above all heavens; but the change will be in you, when ye shall have new senses, and the soul shall be a more deep &amp; more capacious vessel to take in more of Christ; and when means, the chariot, the Gospel that he is now carried in, and ordinances that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh him, shall be removed: sure ye cannot now be said to see him face to face, or to drink of the wine of the highest fountain, or to take in seas and tides of fresh love, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, without vessels, mids's or messengers, at the fountain it self, as ye shall doe a few dayes hence: when ye shall be so near as to be with Christ, <hi>Luk. 23: 43, Ioh, 17: 24. Phil. 1: 23. 1 Thess.</hi> 4: 17. ye would no doubt bestow a dayes journey, yea, many dayes journey on earth, to goe up to heaven and fetch down any thing of Christ: how much more may ye be willing to make a journey, to goe in person to heaven [it is not lost time, but gained eternity] to enjoy the full Godhead, &amp; then in such a manner as he is not there in his week-dayes apparel, as he is here with us, in a drop or the tenth part of a night's dewing of grace &amp; sweetness, but he is there in his Marriage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe of glory, richer, more costly, more precious, in one hem or button of that garment of fountain-majesty, then a million of worlds. O the well is deep! ye shall then think that Preachers &amp; sinfull Ambassadors on earth, did but spill &amp; mar his praises, when they spoke of him and preached his beauty.
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:57570:294"/>
Alas! we but make Christ black &amp; less lovely, in making such insignificant &amp; dry &amp; cold &amp; low expressions of his highest and transcendent super-excellency, to the daughters of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Sure, I have often for my own part sinned in this thing: No doubt, Angels doe not fulfill their task according to their obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, in that Christ kept their feet from falling with the lost Devils, though I know they are not behinde in going to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of created power: but there is sin in our praising, &amp; sin in the quantity, besides other sins: but I must leave this, it is too deep for me: Goe &amp; see &amp; we desire to goe with you: But we are not masters of our own diet. If in that last journey ye tread on a serpent in the way, &amp; thereby wound your heel, as Jesus Christ did before you, the print of the wound shall not be known at the resurrection of the just. Death is but an aw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The worst possibly that may be, is, that ye leave behinde you, children, husband, &amp; the Church of God in miseries; but ye cannot get them to heaven with you for the present, ye shall not miss them, &amp; Christ cannot miscount one of the poorest of his lambs: no lad, no girle, no poor one shall be a missing, ere ye see them again, in the day that the Son shall render up the Kingdom to his Father. The evening &amp; the shadow of every poor hireling is coming, the Church of Christ's Sun in this life is declining Low, not a soul of the Militant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany will be here within few Generations, our Husband will send for them all. It is a rich mercy, we are not married to Time longer then the course be finished. Ye may rejoyce that ye goe not to heaven till ye know that Jesus is there before you, that when ye come thither, at your first entry ye may finde the smell of his oyntments, his Myrrhe, Aloe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; Cassia: and this first salutation of his will make you finde, it is no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable thing to die. Goe and enjoy your gain, live on Christ's love while ye are here, and all the way, as for
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:57570:295"/>
the Church ye leave behinde you, the Government is upon Christ's shoulders, and he will plead for the blood of his Saints: The bush hath been burning above five thousand years &amp; we never yet saw the ashes of this fire: yet a little while &amp; the vision shall not tarry, it shall speak &amp; not lye. I am more afraid of my duty, then of the Head, Christ's government, he cannot fail to bring judgement to victory. O that we could wait for our hidden life! O that Christ would remove the covering, draw aside the curtain of time, and rent the heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens &amp; come down! O that shadows &amp; night were gone, that the day would break, &amp; he that feedeth among the lilies would cry to his heavenly trumpetters, <hi>marke ready, let us goe down &amp; fold to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the four corners of the world &amp; marry the Bride.</hi> His grace be with you. Now if I have found favour with you &amp; if ye judge me faithfull, my last sute to you is, that ye would leave me a legacy, &amp; that is, that my name be at the very last in your prayers, as I desire also it may be in the prayers of these of your Christian Acquaintance with whom ye have been intimate.</p>

               <p>GRace, mercy &amp; peace be to you: It is the least of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cely &amp; royal bounty of Jesus Christ, to pay a King's debts &amp; not to have his servants at a loss: his gold is better then yours, &amp; his hundred fold is the in-come &amp; rent of heaven &amp; far above your revenues: ye are not the first who have casten up your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts that way: better have Christ your factor then any other, for he tradeth to the advantage of his poor servants. But if the hundred fold in this life be so well told, as Christ cannot pay you with miscounting or deferred hope, O what must the rent of
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:57570:295"/>
that Land be, which rendereth every day, &amp; every hour of the years of long Eternity, the whole rent of a year, yea, of more then thousand thousands of ages, even the weighty in-come of a rich Kingdom, not every summer once, but every moment! That summe of glory will take you &amp; all the Angels telling. To be a Tennant to such a Land-lord, where every berry &amp; grape of the large field beareth no worse fruit then glory, fulness of joy &amp; pleasures that endure for evermore, I leave it to your self to think what a summer, what a soil, what a garden, must be there, and what must be the commodities of that highest Land, where Sun &amp; Moon are under the feet of the inhabitants: Surely the Land cannot be bought with gold, blood, banishment, loss of father &amp; mother, husband, wife, children: We but dwell here because we can doe no better; it is need, not vertue, to be sojourners in a prison; to weep &amp; sigh, &amp; Alas! to sin 60 or 70 years in a land of tears: the fruits that grow here are all seasoned &amp; salted with sin. O how sweet is't that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the first born should be divided in two great bodies of an Army, &amp; some in their countrey, &amp; some in the way to their countrey! If it were no more but to see once the face of the Prince of this good land, &amp; to be feasted for eternity with the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, sweetness, dainties of the rayes &amp; beams of matchless glory &amp; incomparable fountain-love, it were a well spent journey to creep, hands &amp; feet, through seven deaths &amp; seven hells, to enjoy him up at the well-head. Onely let us not weary, the miles to that Land are fewer &amp; shorter then when we first beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: strangers are not wise to quarrel with their Host &amp; complain of their lodging; it's a foul way, but a fair home. O that I had but such grapes &amp; clusters out of the Land, as I have sometime seen &amp; tasted in the place where of your <hi>La:</hi> maketh mention! but the hope of it in the end is a heartsom convoy in the way: if I see little more of the gold till the race be ended, I dare not quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel: it is the Lord: I hope his chariot shall goe through these three Kingdoms, after our suffering shall be accomplished. Grace be with you.</p>

               <p>I shall with my soul desire the peace of these Kingdoms, &amp; I doe beleeve, it shall at last come as a river &amp; as the mighty waves of the sea; but O that we were ripe &amp; in readiness to receive it! The preserving of two or three or four or five berries in the outmost boughs of the Olive-tree after the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, is like to be a great matter ere all be done: yet I know, a Cluster in both Kingdoms shall be saved, for a blessing is in it: but it is not [I fear] so near to the dawning of the day of Salvation, but that the clouds must send down moe showers of blood, to water the vineyard of the Lord, &amp; to cause it to blossom. <hi>Scotland's</hi> scum is not yet removed, nor is <hi>England's</hi> dross &amp; tin taken away, nor the filth of our blood purged by the spirit of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; the spirit of Burning. But I am too much on this sad sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. As for my self, I doe esteem nothing out of heaven and next to a communion with Jesus Christ, more, then to be in the hearts &amp; prayers of the saints: I know, he feedeth there amongst the lies till the day break: but I am at a low ebbe, as to any sensible communion with Christ, yea, as low as any soul can be, &amp; doe scarce know where I am, &amp; doe now make it a Question, If any can goe to him who dwelleth in light inaccessible through nothing but darkness? Sure, all that come to heaven have a stock in Christ, but I know not where mine is: It cannot be enough for me to beleeve the Salvation of others, &amp; to know Christ to be the honey-comb, the Rose of <hi>Sharon,</hi> the Paradise &amp; <hi>Eden</hi> of the Saints &amp; first-born writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in heaven, &amp; not to see afar the borders of that good land: But what shall I say? Either this is the Lord making grace a new creation, where there is pure nothing &amp; sinfull nothing to work upon, or I am gone. I should count my soul ingaged to your self &amp; others there with you, if ye would but carry to Christ for me a letter of ciphers &amp; non-sense [for I know not how to make language of my condition] onely showing that I have need of his love; for I know, many fair &amp; washen ones

stand now in white before the throne, who were once as black as I am. If Christ pass his word to wash a sinner, it is less to him then a word to make fair Angels of black Devils: Onely let the art of free Grace be ingaged. I have not a Cautioner to give Surety, nor doeth a Mediator, such as he is in all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, need a Mediator: But what I need, he knoweth: onely, it is his depth of wisdom to let some pass millions of miles over score in debt, that they may stand between the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning &amp; the losing, in need of more then ordinary free grace. Christ hath been multiplying Grace &amp; Mercy above these sive thousand years, &amp; the latter born heirs have so much greater guiltiness, that Christ hath passed moe experiments &amp; multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied essays of heart-love on others, by misbeleeving, after it is past all question many hundreds of ages, that Christ is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable &amp; now uncontroverted Treasurer of multiplied re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demptions; so now he is saying, The more of the disease there is, the more of the Physician's art of Grace &amp; tenderness, there must be: Onely I know, no sinner can put infinite Grace to it, so as the Mediator shall have difficultie or much adoe to save this or that man: Millions of hells of sinners cannot come near to exhaust infinite Grace. I pray you [remembring my love to your wife &amp; friends there] let me finde that I have Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitors there amongst your acquaintance, and forget not <hi>Scotland.</hi>

If there were not a fountain of free Grace to water the dry ground &amp; an uncreated wind to breath on withered &amp; dry bones, we were gone. The wheels of Christ's Chariot to pluck us out of the womb of many deaths, are winged like Eagles. All I have, is, to desire to beleeve that Christ will show all good-will to save, &amp; as for your La: I know that the Lord Jesus carrieth on no design against you, but seeketh you to save &amp; redeem you: He lieth not in wait for your fall's, except it be to take you up: His way of redeeming is ravishing &amp; taking: There are moe miracles of glorified sinners in heaven, then can be on the earth. Nothing of you, <hi>Madam,</hi> nay not your leaf can wither: Verily it is a King's life to follow the Lamb: But when ye see him in his own countrey at home, ye will think ye never saw him before: <hi>He shall be admired of all them that beleeve, 2 Thess</hi> 1: 10. Ye may judge how far all your now sad dayes &amp; tossings, changes, losses, wants conflicts, shall then be below you.

               <p>GRace, mercy &amp; peace be to you: It hath seemed good [as I hear] to him who hath appointed a bounds for the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of our moneths, to gather-in a sheaf of ripe corn [in the death of your Christian Mother] into his garner: It's the more evident that winter is near, when apples without violence of wind, doe of their own accord fall off the tree. She is now above the winter, with a little change of place, not of a Saviour, onely she enjoyeth him now without messages &amp; in his own immediat presence, from whom she heard by letters &amp; messengers before. I grant, Death is to her a very new thing, but Heaven was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared of old: &amp; Christ, as enjoyed in his highest throne &amp; as loade<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with glory &amp; incomparably exalted above men &amp; Angels, having such a heavenly Circle of glorified harpers &amp; Musicians above, compassing the throne with a song, is to her a new thing; but so new, as the first summer-rose or the first fruits of that heavenly field, or as a new Paradise to a traveller broken &amp; worn out of breath with the sad occurrences of a long &amp; dirty way. Ye may easily judge, <hi>Madam,</hi> what a large recompence is made to all her service, her walking with God, &amp; her sorrows, with the first cast of the soul's eye upon the shining &amp; admirably beautifull face of the Lamb that is in the midst of that fair &amp; white Army that is there, &amp; with the first draught &amp; taste of the fountain of life fresh &amp; new at the well-head: To say nothing of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying of that face without a date, for more then this terme of life which we now enjoy. And it cost her no more to goe thither, but to suffer Death to doe her this piece of service: For by him who was dead &amp; is alive, she was delivered from the second death: What then is the first death to the second? Not a scratch of the hide of a singer, to the endless second death. And now she <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

in the year: O what Spring-time is there! Even the smelling of the odours of that great &amp; eternally blooming Rose of <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> for ever &amp; ever? What a singing life is there? There is not a dumb bird in all that large field, but all sing &amp; breath out heaven, joy, glory, dominion, to the high Prince of that new found Land. And verily the Land is the sweeter, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ payed so dear a rent for it, &amp; he is the glory of the Land. All which, I hope, doeth not so much mitigate &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley your grief for her part [&amp; truely this should seem sufficient] as the unerring exprctation of the dawning of that day upon your self, and the hope ye have the the fruition of that same King and Kingdom to your own soul: Certainly, the hope of it when things look so dark-like on both Kingdoms, must be an exceeding great quickning to languishing spirits, who are far from home while we are here. What misery to have both a bad way all the day, &amp; no hope of lodging at night? But He hath taken up your lodging for you. I can say no more now but I pray that the very God of peace may establish your heart to the end. I rest.</p>

It may be that I am uncapable of new light, &amp; cannot receive that Spirit [whereof some vainly boast) but that which was from the beginning which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, &amp; our hands have handled, even <hi>the word of life, 1 Ioh.</hi> 1: 2, 3. hath been declared to you: Thousands of thousands walking in that light &amp; that good old way, have gone to heaven &amp; are now before the throne: Truth is but one, &amp; hath no num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. <hi>Christ</hi> &amp; <hi>Antichrist</hi> are both now in the camp, &amp; are come to open blowes: Christ's poor ship saileth in a sea of blood, the passengers are so sea-sick of a high fever, that they miscall one another, Christ [I hope] shall bring the broken bark to land: I had rather swim for life &amp; death on an old plank, or a broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> board, to land with Christ, then enjoy the rotten peace we have hitherto had. It is like, the Lord will take a severe course with us, to cause the children of the family agree together. I conceive that Christ hath a great designe of free grace to these Lands; but his wheels must move over mountains &amp; rocks: He never yet wooed a Bride on earth, but in blood, in fire, &amp; in the wilderness. A cross of our own chusing, honeyed &amp; sugared with consolations, we cannot have: I think not much of a cross when all the children of the house weep with me &amp; for me, &amp; to suffer when we enjoy the communion of Saints, is not much; but it is hard when Saints rejoyce in the suffering of Saints &amp; redeemed ones hurt, yea, even goe nigh to hate redeemed ones. I confess, I imagined there had no more been such an affliction on earth, or in the world, then that one elect Angel should fight against another: but for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the communion of Saints, we have need of new-born crosses, scarce ever heard of before: the saints are not Christ, there is no misjudging in him, there is much in us, &amp; a doubt it is, if we shall have fully one heart till we enjoy one heaven: our star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light hideth us from our selves, &amp; hideth us one from another, &amp; Christ from us all; but he will not be hidden from us. I shall wish that all the sons of our father in that Land be of one minde, &amp; that they be not shaken nor moved from the Truth once receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Christ was in that Gospel, &amp; Christ is the same now that he
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:57570:299"/>
was in the Prelates time: That Gospel cannot sink, it will make you free &amp; bear you out. Christ, the subject of it, is the chosen of God, &amp; cometh from <hi>Bozrah,</hi> with garments dyed in blood. <hi>Ireland</hi> &amp; <hi>Scotland</hi> both must be his field in which he shall feed &amp; gather lilies: suppose [which yet is impossible] that some had an eternity of Christ in <hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp; a sweet summer of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, &amp; a feast of fat things for evermore in <hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp; one should never come to heaven, it should be a desirable life; the King's spikenard, Christ's perfume, his apples of love, his oyntments, even down in this lower house of clay, are a choice heaven: O what then is the King in his own land! where there is such a throne, so many Kings palaces, ten thousand thousands of crowns of glory that want heads yet to fill them: O so much lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure as shall be there to sing! O such a tree as groweth there in the midst of that paradise, where the inhabitants sing eternally under it's branches! To look in at a window &amp; see the branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es burdened with the apples of life, to be the last man that shall come in thither, were too much for me. I pray you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber me to the Christians there &amp; remember our private Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Grace be with you.</p>

               <p>I Know ye have learned long agoe, ere I knew any thing of Christ, that if we had the Cross at our own election, we would either have law-surety for freedom from it, or then we would have it honeyed &amp; sugared with comforts, so, as the sweet should over-master the gall &amp; wormwood. Christ knoweth how to breed the sons of his house, &amp; ye will give him leave to take his own way of dispensation with you, &amp; though it be rough, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him: he defieth you to have as much patience to him, as he hath born to you. I am sure, there cannot a dram-weight
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:57570:299"/>
of gall be less in your cup, &amp; ye would not desire, he sould both afflict you &amp; hurt your soul. When his people cannot have a Providence of silk &amp; roses, they must be content with such an one as he carveth out for them: ye would not goe to heaven but with company, &amp; ye may perceive that the way of these who went before you, was through blood, sufferings, &amp; many afflictions: Nay, Christ, the Captain, went in over the door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threshold of Paradise, bleeding to death. I doe not think but ye have learned to stoop, though ye (as others) be naturally stiff, &amp; that ye have found that the apples &amp; sweet fruits which grow on that crabbed tree of the Cross are as sweet as it is so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I Judge you ten thousand times happy that ever ye was Grace's debter, for certainly Christ hath ingaged you over head &amp; ears to free Grace, &amp; take the debt with you to Eternity, <hi>Immanuel's.</hi> highest land, where ye finde before you a house-full of Christ's everlasting debters; the less shame to you.

O to suck these breasts of full consolation above, &amp; to drink Christ's new wine up in his father's house, is some greater matter then is beleeved! since it was brewed from eternity for the head of the house, &amp; so many thousand crowned Kings: Rubs in the way where the lodging is so good are not much.

               <p>I Cannot speak to you: the way ye know the passage is free &amp; not stopped, the print of the footsteps of the fore-runner is clear &amp; manifest, many have gone before you: Ye will not sleep long in the dust before the day break: it is a far shorter piece of the hinder-end of the night to you, then to <hi>Abraham</hi> &amp; <hi>Moses,</hi> beside all the time of their bodies resting under curruption, it is as long yet to their day as to your morning light of awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to glory; though their spirits having the advantage of yours, have had now the fore-start of the shore before you. I dare say nothing against his dispensation: I hope to follow quickly: The heirs that are not there before you, are posting with haste after you, &amp; none shall take your lodging over your head. Be not heavy, the life of faith is now called for: doing was never rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned in your accounts, (though Christ in &amp; by you hath done more, then by twenty, yea an hundred gray-haired &amp; godly Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors) beleeving now is your last: Look to that word: <hi>Gal. 2: v. 20. Nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me:</hi> Ye know the <hi>I</hi> that liveth, &amp; the <hi>I</hi> that liveth not: It is not single <hi>Ye</hi> that liveth, Christ by law liveth in the brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en debter: It is not a life by doing or holy walking, but the living of Christ in you: If ye look to your self as divided from Christ, ye must be more then heavy: All your wants <hi>[dear Brother]</hi> be upon him, ye are his debter, Grace must summe &amp; subscribe your accounts as paid: stand not upon <hi>Items,</hi> &amp; small or little Sanctification: ye know, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent</hi> Holiness must stand by, when <hi>imputed</hi> is all. I fear the clay-house is a-taking down &amp; undermining; but it is nigh the dawning, look to the East, the dawning of glory is near: your Guide is good company &amp; knoweth all the miles &amp; the up's &amp; down's in the way; the nearer the morning, the darker. Some traveller seeth the city 20 miles off &amp; at a distance; &amp;

yet within the eight part of a mile, he cannot see it. It is all keeping, that ye would now have, till ye need it: &amp; if sense &amp; fruition come both at once, it is not your loss: let Christ tutour you as he thinks good; ye cannot be marred nor miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in his hand. <hi>Want</hi> is an excellent qualification, &amp; <hi>no money, no price,</hi> to you [who, I know, dare not glory in your own righteousness] is ritness warrantable enough to cast your self upon him who justifieth the ungodly.

It is a rich mercy that the Lord Christ will be Master of your will and of all your delights, and that his way is so fair for the landing of husband &amp; children before-hand in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey wherherto ye are journeying. No matter, how little ye be ingaged to the world, since ye have such experience of cross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dealing in it: had ye been a childe of the house, the world would have dealt more warmly with it's own: there is less of you out of heaven that the childe is there and the husband is there, but much more that your Head and Kinsman &amp; Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er doeth fetch home such as are in danger to be lost: &amp; from this time forward, fetch not your comforts from such broken cis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns &amp; dry wells: if the Lord pull at the rest, ye must not be the creature that shall hold when he draweth. Truly to me your case is more comfortable, then if the fire-side were well plenished with ten children: the Lord saw ye was able by his grace to bear the loss of husband and childe, &amp; that ye are that weak and tender as not to be able to stand under the mercy of a gracious husband living, &amp; flourishing in esteem with Authority, and in reputation for Godliness and Learning: for he knoweth the weight of these mercies would crush you and break you: and a there is no searching out of his understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, so he hath skill to know what providence will make Christ dearest to you: and let not your heart say, <hi>it is an ill wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Ah, we savour not the things that are above, nor doe we smell of glory ere we come thither, but we transact &amp; agree with Time for a new lease of clay-mansions: Behold he cometh we sleep, &amp; turn all the work of duties into a dispute of events for deliverance; but the greatest haste, to be humbled for a brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en &amp; a buried <hi>Covenant,</hi> is first &amp; last forgotten: And all our grief is, the Lord lingers, enemies triumph, Godly ones suffer, Atheists blaspheme. Ah, we pray not! but wonder that Christ cometh not the higher way by might, by power, by gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments rolled in blood! What if he come the lower way? sure, we sin in putting the book in his hand, as if we could teach the Almighty knowledge: we make haste, we beleeve not: Let the onely wise God alone, he stirs well, he drawes straight lines, though we think &amp; say they are crooked: It is right that
