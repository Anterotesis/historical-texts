            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The firſt Commiſſion and Power granted to that Court to hear and determine Civil Actions, was in the Reign of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. And the Conſtituting Clauſe in the Statute of the 34. and 35 of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. relates only to the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> Juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>The Lordſhips-Marchers (being found inconvenient) by an Act made 27 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. were made new <hi>Welſh</hi> Counties, and the Court of the great Seſſions Erected, which ſtill continues; And leſt <hi>Wales</hi> ſhould not acquieſce under ſuch Conſtitution, the Court before the Preſident and Council of the <hi>Marches</hi> was continued, in the Nature of the Court of <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> only.</p>
            <p>The Statute of 16 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. which took away the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> doth alſo take away this Court, and the Lord Preſidents Court in the <hi>North;</hi> And declares that the King and Council have no Juriſdiction by Engliſh-Bill, or otherwiſe, to determine Civil Cauſes: But that the ſame ought to be determined in the Courts of Juſtice, by the Ordinary Courſe of Law.</p>
            <div type="reason">

               <p n="1">I. It is a great and conſtant Annual Charge to the Crown, and is of no Advantage to it, but an intollerable Grievance to the Subject: All Cauſes Tried there one year with another, amount not in Value, by common computation, to above 400 <abbr>
                     <hi>l</hi>
                  </abbr> tho the Expence to the Subjects is at leaſt 30000 <abbr>

                  <hi>per Annum;</hi> moſt of the Actions brought there, being for Treſpaſſes, Aſſaults, and other trivial Actions, where the Damages are generally 4 <abbr>

                  </abbr> and ſeldome exceed Ten Shillings.</p>
               <p n="2">II. It is uſeleſs, the Reaſons for Erecting and continuing it Ceaſing: It is not concerned in the preſerving of the Publick Peace, That being done by the Judges of the great Seſſions, and Juſtices of the Peace, as in all Engliſh Counties.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The Lands and Poſſeſſions of the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> are long ſince ſold, and all the Revenue ariſing from <hi>Wales,</hi> is now yearly paid to the Receiver for <hi>Wales,</hi> and Anſwer'd into the Exchequer at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> which was provided for by the Statute 27 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The Court of the Great Seſſions held twice every year, and kept for Six Days in every County, hath in it Courts of Common Law and Equity, and all Matters of Law are there Tryed by Jury, and the Expence there in Tryals is much leſs, and Cauſes ſooner determined, if proſecuted, than in the Court of the <hi>Marches of Wales;</hi> for a Suit in Equity may be brought to a hearing in one Circuit, the Court of Equity going through all the Circuit, which laſts for Three Weeks; and all the Actions under 40 <abbr>

               <head>The GRIEVANCES.</head>
               <p n="1">I. The Conſtitution of that Court is againſt Law, their Proceedings and Decrees being Arbitrary; Damages in Cauſes, wherein Damages are uncertain, aſſeſſed by the Judges without Jury, contrary to the great Charter, the Laws and Birthright of the Subject; from which Decree there lies no Appeal, and yet the Subject cannot Plead the Decree of that Court in Barr to a Suit brought in another Court for the ſame Matter; whereby all Suits and Determinations in that Court become ineffectual.</p>
               <p n="2">II. This Court, to encourage Suits, gives the Plaintiff on the leaſt colour of Suit his full Coſts, and holds Plea of Debt under 40 <abbr>
                     <hi>s</hi>
                  </abbr> and therein, and in Treſpaſſes, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, and Slander, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where the Damages are but 6 <abbr>

                  </abbr> there is uſually 5 <abbr>

                     <hi>l</hi>
                  </abbr> Coſts, given to the Plaintiff; and the Defendant, tho put to greater Expence, and the Suit appear vexatious, is diſmiſſed without Coſts.</p>

                  </abbr> and double the Sum for every other <hi>Dedimus;</hi> and ſcandalous Perſons are permitted to practiſe there, and the Court grants them Protections from being impleaded in other Courts; and alſo grant Injunctions for ſtay of Proceedings in the Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and Great Seſſions, and the inferiour Courts; and puniſh the Diſobedience to ſuch Illegal Injunctions, by Impriſonment and otherwiſe.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. That Prohibitions uſually granted in the Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to ſtay Proceedings in the ſaid Court of the Marches, have of late (to advance Arbitrary Power) been denied in any Action whatſoever, tho Damages be uncertain, which Practice is maintained by a general Contribution of all the Clerks there.</p>
               <p n="5">V. That before <hi>Subpoena,</hi> which is the Original Proceſs or Summons in that Court, the Court grants a binding Proceſs, in nature of an Attachment in <hi>Chancery;</hi> and the Parties taken thereupon, and upon other Proceſs of Contempt, give Sureties, who are not only obliged for the perſon's appearance, but alſo to pay the Debt; and the Party in Contempt is obliged to appear in perſon, and then being committed to Cuſtody, he is uſually charged at the Suit of other perſons; and his Sureties are equally obliged to anſwer ſuch ſubſequent Charge.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Proceſs of Contempt ought to be directed to the Sheriff; but this Court, till of late, directed them to their own Curſitors only: and when of late they have direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Sheriffs and Curſitors, they are always executed by the Curſitors only, whereby the Poor are much oppreſſed, and pay intollerable Compoſitions. And if any of their Curſitors, who are generally lewd perſons, make any Affidavit of any Abuſe in ſerving of Proceſs, a Serjeant at Arms is immediately thereupon ſent and the Party, before he be heard, muſt pay the Serjeant's Fees, and what the Court thinks fit, or ſent to Priſon, tho the Oath be never ſo much falſified.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Witneſſes in Cauſes wherein Damages are uncertain, are examined by Commiſſions, and that executed by one Commiſſioner, and he generally a Sollicitor in the Court named by the Plaintiff; and the Clerks commonly appoint one another Commiſſioners, whereby Perjuries and Frauds are encouraged.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. It is no Court of Record; and their Proceedings are in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and Paper, (which is againſt Law); and they cannot try any Error in Fact, having no power to <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               <p n="9">IX. If any Action be brought for falſe Impriſonment, for executing any Proceſs iſſued out of this Court, the Defendant muſt be at 8 <abbr>

               <p n="10">X. That the Courts of Equity in the Great Seſſions in each County can quiet Poſſeſſions: Yet this Court doth not only quiet, but alter Poſſeſſions; and upon filing a Bill without any Proceſs ſerved, gives Poſſeſſion where none was before. <hi>As thus:</hi> If the Plaintiff, tho he was never in Poſſeſſion, ſwears, or gets another to ſwear for him, That He, or thoſe under whom he claims, have for three years laſt been in Poſſeſſion, the Court orders the Poſſeſſion to ſuch perſon from the perſon that is in actual in Poſſeſſion, tho at the Hearing it often appears that ſuch Plaintiff hath no Title; and Trial of any Title there is contrary to the Conſtitution of that Court.</p>
