            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I can giue him; is, to make my selfe (as far as in mee lyeth) such a one, as that hee neede not repent, nor be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the respect hee hath showne mee: and that, if I should dye vnable to repay his kindnesses; he might yet, haue some cause, to think his fauors not altogether lost vpon mee. Nay rather, might reckon them among the good deedes he hath done) in regard I haue made vse of them, (not to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low my pleasures, but) to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble me in some good endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours.</p>
            <p>Of which, this little volume is a part; &amp; knowing, I should

well witnesse my loue vnto him, whensoeuer I gaue good testimony of mine honest affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction towards you. Lo, as a pledge therof, I consecrate to your vse, these <hi>Exercises.</hi> And, with your name, deliuer them ouer to the world. That, when, and wheresoeuer they shall be read; you may be remembred, both for a louer of these kinds of studies, &amp; a Fauourer of his, who was desirous to bee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly employed. For, such haue you approued your selfe towards mee, both in your courteous familiarity: and by that free accesse, which in my meditations, I haue alwayes
<pb facs="tcp:20921:3"/>
had to your Library.</p>
            <p>Accept then these papers; &amp; let it not be tedious vnto you, sometime to read them ouer. For, though I may be thought fitter by many, to accompany you in the way of pleasures: then to present you with any sound precepts of morality, or Religion. Yet, I hope, you shall finde me an Instrument: readier to encourage you, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery of those vertues, wherwith your education hath acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted your youth: then to whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper ought, that may bring you in loue with those vanities; whereunto, ouer-many other of our Gentry, are so much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinde.
<pb facs="tcp:20921:3"/>
For, though that way, I might haue more bettered my fortunes, and esteeme, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong some men. This way, I am sure, I shall better satisfie my conscience, and my dutie to God.</p>
            <p>Neuerthelesse, I prefer not this to instruct you; but, to be a Remembrancer, of those things, in which you haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie beene instructed. For, your good Father, hath not onely largely prouided for you, the temporall felicities: but, asmuch, as in him lieth, prepared you for that <hi>Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> which is treated of in these <hi>Exercises.</hi> More he cannot do;

For, the greatest <hi>Monarch</hi> of the world, hath neither power to giue, nor take it, from you. Yea, and without it, the more of other blessings you possesse, the more miserable they will make you. But, I know, you will bee happie in the prosecution therof, that you may treble that happines, in the possession of it. And, to that end, you haue my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who am</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Know, that many of you, e're this time, expected the first Decade of the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> according to the promise, in my <hi>Preparation.</hi> And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when you behold here, but a tenth part of it, I shall be thought to come too much short of what I inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. As indeed I doe (seeing, I then wanted not much, of hauing fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed the whole <hi>Decade</hi> in that manner, as I purposed to set it forth) But, if it were here fitting (or any way for your profit) to discouer them,
<pb facs="tcp:20921:5"/>
I might giue vndenyable reasons (to excuse my selfe) which I now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale.</p>
            <p>Onely thus much, I will say. Few men consider, how many paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full dayes (after the maine labour is ended) the writing ouer againe of such a volume will aske; how many moneths it may be afterward atten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded at the Presse; how much charge, the Authors little means, may (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any profit of his labours) bee put to; nor, through how many vnloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked-for troubles and businesses, hee must make way vnto the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it. For, if they did know, and weigh this; so many, that are idle ones themselues, would not so often (as I heare they doe) blame my
<pb facs="tcp:20921:5"/>
idlenesse. But, rather wonder, how; and when, I got meanes and time, to performe what is already done.</p>
            <p>Discouragements, and hinderan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I haue had many, since I began to meddle with the <hi>Psalmes.</hi> But helps, or encouragements, I haue had none; no, not the least part of one: saue the comforts, which I haue found, within mine owne heart. And they are so great, that I am still resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to proceed in this work, as I shal be enabled. For, though it may come the more slowly forward, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of some lets: yet, I am perswaded, God will supply, by his grace, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, I am that way depriued of. And (if I can haue patience) bring what I intend, to much more happie
<pb facs="tcp:20921:6"/>
perfection, then if I had receiued no obstacle in the performance.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Psalme,</hi> in the meane while, my friends were desirous of; and haue wished me thus to publish the rest, by one or two together, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till a whole <hi>Decade</hi> be imprinted: That so (euery <hi>Psalme,</hi> being an entire thing of it selfe) those poore men, who are desirous of them, and vnable to spare so much money to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as will buy a greater booke, may by little and little, without any hinderance furnish themselues of all. And beside, they thinke the portable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of it, may make it the more frequently read; for which causes I haue hearkned vnto them.</p>
            <p>Take then in good part, this little
<pb facs="tcp:20921:6"/>
beginning. Value it, as it shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue to bee esteemed; And, let not my vnworthinesse bee any blemish vnto it. For, though I am no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest Diuine; yet, my profession is Christianitie, and these my labours, hauing the approbation of Authority, are not to be despisedly reckoned of, as mine; but receiued as the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the <hi>Church</hi>: who hath now, by her allowance, both made them her owne, and deliuered them ouer vnto you. So; Gods blessing on you, and me, and farwell.</p>

and the meanes, whereby he ascended vnto the cleere know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the high Mysteries, deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in euery <hi>Psalme.</hi> Now, although here be no <hi>Title</hi> to shew vs so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly, what he made the foundation of his contemplation, that we should peremptorily conclude it, to be this, or that particular; yet, by the matter of the <hi>Psalme,</hi> we may (I hope) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out iniury to the Holy Spirit, giue our meditations leaue to ayme ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at. And to me it plainely appeareth to bee that Double-Law of God, which was giuen in <hi>Paradise.</hi> For, though at the beginning, God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man, that he should know, loue, enioy him, and bee made blessed in that fruition; yet, he would not that such blessednesse should be obtained without some condition. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee gaue him an easie, but (as I sayd before) a Double-Law,<note place="margin">Genes. 2.</note> partly affirmatiue, partly negatiue: the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatiue
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:20921:9"/>
part was, that hee should dresse the garden, and eat freely of euery tree therein: the negatiue was, that he should not eat of the Tree of knowledge of good and euill. And there was both a promise of reward, for his obedience; and a commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of punishment, if hee transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: but <hi>Adam,</hi> who by obedience, might haue beene eternally happy; by disobedience, was thrust out of <hi>Paradise,</hi> into a world of miseries, to wander for euer in discontentment, and in the vnhappy shadowes of death. Which God beholding with pity, bestowed on him, in place of originall righteousnesse which hee lost; a meanes of Iustification: and (changing the accidents, though not the essence of his first command) gaue to him in his Word, that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Law of Faith, by which hee, and his posterity, might bee directed out of the way of perdition, and ariue
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:20921:10"/>
againe at true felicity. This Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, being the first in the holy book of God, that most neerely concernes vs, the Prophet, as it seemeth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated, and made it the obiect and ground-worke of this first <hi>Psalme:</hi> For, as God gaue to our first <hi>Parents</hi> in <hi>Paradise,</hi> a negatiue and affirmatiue Law, so in that vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall Law, imposed since their fall, some things are commanded, and some forbidden to bee done; and that Law, in respect of the essence, is one throughout all the ages of the Church. Moreouer, as <hi>Adam,</hi> if hee had kept the Commandement of God in <hi>Paradise,</hi> should haue there liued a happy life, and peraduenture beene translated from thence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out death, into a more glorious bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse in Heauen; so wee, by kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Law, which is since giuen vnto vs insteed of the Tree of life in this world, shall obtaine the blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:20921:10"/>
of Grace in Gods Church for the present, and the perfection of all happinesse (euen the life of eternall glory) hereafter. Contrariwise, as <hi>Adam,</hi> by contemning the Law of God, with the tree of life, in eating the forbidden fruit, lost thereby the Estate of blessednesse, and incurred for the breach of a double Law, the danger of a double death; so, those which transgresse the two-fold Law of Faith and Workes, which he hath since giuen in his Word, doe both depriue themselues of the fore-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med felicity, and are the second time (and that irrecouerably) in the way of eternall damnation.</p>
               <p>The effect hereof is opened in this <hi>Psalme</hi>; and therefore it may with good probability bee supposed, that he tooke the Parable, whereupon he compiled this <hi>Hymne,</hi> from the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the Tree of <hi>Life</hi> planted in <hi>Paradise,</hi> and from the Law and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:20921:11"/>
Charge which was there giuen vnto <hi>Adam</hi>; and he sheweth, that as the transgression of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is the way that perisheth; so the fulfilling of the <hi>Law of the Lord,</hi> is the onely meanes which is left vs, to recouer againe the happinesse that we haue lost.</p>

the <hi>Deuill,</hi> or <hi>th'euill,</hi> for so it seemes to haue beene aunciently pronounced, vntill the Saxon Character being somewhat like our D. made vs loose that pronunciation; and as we call him that is the fulnesse of all Good, GOD; so; him that is the perfection of all euill, wee name the <hi>Deuill. These notes I haue added, to shew the Reader, that in my translation I tooke no vaine libertie, but made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of the least variation, and passed ouer nothing, vntill I had some reasonable warrant for what I did.</hi>

both wherein this happinesse consisted, and by what meanes it was to bee attained vnto. Nor in the times of heathen ignorance onely, were men deceiued in their aymes; but euen amongst vs also, at this day, the greatest part run wide, proposing vnto themselues, a happinesse in the enioying of those vaine things, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, they are often hurried quite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side it.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:20921:17"/>
shewes vs, that true <hi>Blessednesse,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther consisteth in obseruation of the morall vertues, as <hi>Philosophers</hi> thought; nor in the worship of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Gods, as the <hi>Pagans</hi> suppose; nor in obseruing the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> as the <hi>Iewes</hi> dreame; nor in enioying the pleasures of this life, as great <hi>Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> and <hi>Epicures</hi> beleeue: But quite ouerthrowing the opinions of all these, and their foolish expectations, who build their contentment on ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, riches, and such like things of this world; he affirmes, that man only to be most truely blessed, and in the path to highest happinesse, who, shunning the wayes of meere natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall men, endeauoureth also to auoyd the custome of sinners, to seperate himselfe from the scornfull enemies of the truth, and to continue sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, embracing and rightly professing the doctrine of Gods word. And this kind of <hi>Preface,</hi> the Holy Ghost,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:20921:18"/>
as it seemes,<note place="margin">Why the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost vsed this preface.</note> hath vsed; because, by discouering (at the first view) so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a Iewell, as <hi>Blessednesse</hi>; hee would allure men, to giue the more heede vnto those mysteries and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, which are afterward deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered: and, if it were possible, make them more willingly conforme themselues vnto the courses, which are inclusiuely propounded. The like kind of beginning hath the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Philosopher, <hi>Aristotle,</hi> vsed in his <hi>Ethicks</hi>; and which is more to be heeded, our Sauiour made it the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordium</hi> of his Doctrine: as appeares in that his first Sermon preached in the Mount, where he begins to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce,<note place="margin">

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:20921:18"/>
not in the Counsell of the vngodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners,</hi> as it followeth in the Psalme. And this his <hi>Blessednesse</hi> is double; for, he hath the hope and means of happinesse in this world, and assurance of eternall glory in the next: or, as the Apostle expresseth it,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8.</note> 
                  <hi>both the promise of this life, and that which is to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, what the blessings of this life are (which God hath ordained, for such as walke in his ordinances) you may read in the last booke of <hi>Moses</hi>;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.3.</note> 
                  <hi>Blessed,</hi> sayd he, <hi>shalt thou be in the Citie, and blessed in the field; blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, the fruit of thy ground, the fruit of thy cattell, the encrease of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep. Blessed shall bee thy basket, and thy store; blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out, and blessed when thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest in.</hi> Yea, as it is in the same chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, among many other temporall blessings, <hi>God shall make thee holy vnto
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:20921:19"/>
himselfe, if thou keepe his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> Or if you would, in a word, receiue a glimpse of the perfection of the blessednesse, which belongs to the godly man. <hi>S. Paul</hi> giueth vs the best knowledge of it, in shewing how farre it is beyond the reach of our knowledge;<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
                  </note> for, saith he, <hi>neither hath eve seene, nor care heard, nor can it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the heart of man, what God hath prepared for them that loue him,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.9.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Psalme,</hi> as I sayd in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, consisteth of two parts; in this first part, is set forth the blessed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of the Iust, and who is such an one: in the other part, the miserable condition of the wicked. In the two first verses, the <hi>Blessednesse,</hi> and Piety of the man so happy, is both nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely, and affirmatiuely described; for,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Psal.</hi> 34.14.</note> the <hi>Prophet</hi> hath begun, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that saying of S. <hi>Peter, Shun euill, and doe good:</hi> and indeed, true
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:20921:19"/>
righteousnesse consisteth, aswell in eschewing what may prouoke, or displease God, as it is expressed in the first verse; as in seriously perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, or endeauouring that which may please him (which is declared in the second.) And, as a well expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Physician, doth first purge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all the ill humours, that occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned the sicknesse of his weake Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; before hee will administer those Cordials, which are prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer his health: So, by this order, in his description of a blessed man, the Holy Ghost doth shew vs, that before the physick of his Word, can worke effectually in our hearts, for the saluation of our soules; wee must bee clensed from the corruptions, which wee haue gotten by the euill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected <hi>counsells</hi> of our owne hearts, or, the infectious society of the wicked: and, as it were, diet our selues, by abstaining from their abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:20921:20"/>
customes; which <hi>Diet,</hi> is here first prescribed in the negatiue: And it is, as if hee had sayd thus. <hi>If you euer intend to recouer the health of your soules, and become partakers of true blessednesse; you must neither walk in the counsels of the vngodly, nor stand in the way of sinners, nor sit in the seat of the scornfull:</hi> for these are the courses which hee shuns, that doth arriue at <hi>happinesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">What manner of expression the Holy Ghost vseth.</note>But, the Holy Ghost hath not here vsed the ordinary manner of speech, in his description; but rather, by way of <hi>Metaphor,</hi> exprest it: &amp; the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine <hi>Muse,</hi> hath into three <hi>Triads,</hi> or triple-heads, diuided this <hi>Negatiue.</hi> In which are to bee considered three <hi>subiects,</hi> three <hi>qualities,</hi> three <hi>actions.</hi> And there is an admirable <hi>gradation</hi> in all the parts: first, in the <hi>subiects,</hi> or <hi>persons</hi>; from an <hi>vngodly man,</hi> to a <hi>sinner</hi>: from a <hi>sinner,</hi> to a <hi>scorner.</hi> Next, in the <hi>degrees</hi> of sinne; as, from
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:20921:20"/>
the <hi>counsell,</hi> to the <hi>way</hi>: from the <hi>way,</hi> to the <hi>seat.</hi> Lastly, in the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> of it; from <hi>walking,</hi> to <hi>standing</hi>; from <hi>standing,</hi> to <hi>sitting</hi>: and their wickednesse, is increased to the full.</p>
               <p>By the <hi>vngodly,</hi>

                  </note> such are heere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, who are still in their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall corruptions; and being ignorant of God, and his seruice, encline to those euill affections, wherunto their nature is subiect. Yea, by the <hi>vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> are principally meant <hi>Infidels</hi>; such as are ignorant of religion, and the diuine worship of God, according to his Word: such, as employ all their endeauours, without thought of him, to become happy in this life; giuing themselues ouer vnto coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, pleasures, with such like vanities, whereunto their affections lead them.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>vngodly,</hi> in our tongue, doth of it selfe, very well answer to this Explication; for, as <hi>Godlinesse</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:20921:21"/>
most properly appertaineth to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi>; so, <hi>vngodlinesse</hi> expresseth the contrary thereunto.

                  <hi>stand</hi> in the <hi>way</hi> of <hi>sinners</hi> (which is the action of it) is worse; But to <hi>sit</hi> in the <hi>seate</hi> of the <hi>scornefull</hi> (which is to die impenitent in his wickednesse) is worst of all, and the highest degree of a Reprobate.</p>
               <p>But,<note place="margin">A briefe of what went before.</note> to draw into sewer words this exposition of these three-folde Negatiues; by the <hi>vngodly,</hi> are ment <hi>vnbeleeuers</hi>; by <hi>sinners,</hi> those that are vniust and dishonest in their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; by <hi>scorners,</hi> obstinate Hereticks; by the <hi>Councels of the vngodly,</hi> are vnderstood the vaine cogitations of meere naturall men, with the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions of <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi>; the <hi>way of sinners,</hi> is a vitious course of life, as the breach of the morrall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts; and the <hi>Chayre of Scorners,</hi> is the obstinate profession of false Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:20921:26"/>
and such like; <hi>stands</hi> in the <hi>way</hi> of the second: And hee, that dies in the maintenance of a false wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, or in any of these sinnes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance; is seated in the <hi>seate</hi> of the <hi>Scornefull.</hi>

And therefore obstinate Hereticks, Atheists, false Teachers, Scorners of the Truth, Deriders of Religion, and vnrepentant sinners; may very well be said to sit, in the <hi>Chayre of Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi>: For, they are the plague of the world; and to be abhorred as a

               <p>And thus haue you this gradation opened; which may bee eyther vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood according, to the ordinarie course: to wit, as from the positiue, to the superlatiue; in this manner.

                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:20921:27"/>
which may properly be gathered out of this verse, are these. First, I obserue, that there be but three steps to Hell, the <hi>purpose</hi> of sinne; the <hi>action</hi> of it; and an <hi>obstinate continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> therein, without repentance: and vnlesse we be very watchfull, we may stip downe those three stayres, before we be aware: For, <hi>Facilis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scensus Anerni</hi>; it is an easy way to Hell: and the nature of sinne is such; that it insinuates by degrees, into the heart, without being perceiued. First, it scrues into good liking; and gaines the consent, or purpose; then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes it vnto action. And so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, vntill it grow ripe; euen to the contempt of God: and this is the policy of the Diuell;<note place="margin">The policy of the Diuell, to draw vs vnto the Counsels of the vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and so forth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</note> to deceiue men: For hee knowes, if hee should perswade at first ouser, to renounce God: it is so vnnaturall a sinne; that it wold seem abhominable, to the worst disposed men: &amp; the hart would not
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:20921:27"/>
admit such a perswasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to take place. Therfore, he makes not that appeare to bee his ayme; but presents them, rather with such bayts, as seeme to haue no danger in them. He counsels them (according to the natural encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of their hearts, and the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of worldlings) to seeke prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, riches, pleasures, with such like vanities; hee shewes them the glory and vse they may haue; he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades the Christian, who is in a meane degree of life, that if he would seeke after honours, he might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by become a Patron, for the afflicted members of the Church, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. But hee knowes well, the olde saying will proue true, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nores mutant mores,</hi> Honours change manners: and that preserment is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, not onely to make them forget many good thoughts, and resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which they haue in a lower e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state: but to blot out of memory
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:20921:28"/>
also: friendship, kinred, and the knowledge of themselues (as wee daily see it doth) yea, the Deuill is sure, that if hee can procure a man, but once to climb the ladder of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion; it will so intangle him with the loue thereof, that it is twenty to one, but that he will renounce God, before hee will yeeld to step one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree backe againe.</p>
               <p>Others, hee tempts with ease; and makes them (poore soules) beleeue, that if they might disburthen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues of such businesses, or such and such cares, that they should then bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter attend to the seruice of God, and with a more quiet minde, follow their deuotions. But the Deceiuer is subtill, and hath by experience seene, that afflictions make those seek God, often and earnestly, that being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered of their cares, cannot finde one houre in a month, to serue him.</p>
               <p>Others, againe, hee allureth with
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:20921:28"/>
the loue of riches: and that hee may may do so, he causeth them to imagin (perhaps) that if they were wealthy, as some men are, whom they know: there should not so many poore people, goe thinly clad; nor such numbers die, for want of sustenance. So many <hi>Churches</hi> should not lie ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined; nor so many works of <hi>Pietie,</hi> or for the publike profit, bee vnperfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Yea, he perswades them, that these temporall things, may not only be sought after, and enioyed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the displeasure, or dishonour of God; but serue him also for his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and the better setting forth of his glory. And indeed, so they may; where they are moderately sought after, and gained by honest meanes But,<note place="margin">Few seeke the things of this world tempe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rately, as they ought.</note> where there is one that seekes them, with such temperance; there are ten, who settle their mindes so vpon them, as they choke vp all these good determinations, that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:20921:29"/>
were at first springing in their hearts. For, a man that is not contented with his estate, but desires things out of his owne concupiscence, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect vnto the will of God; that man hath giuen the Deuill aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and is <hi>walking in the counsells of the vngodly,</hi> euen after the vaine co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations of an vnregenerate heart. And not considering the dangerous aduise, that his appetite giues him; hee first suffers his thoughts, to bee busied about those vanities; next, approoues of them; and then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stens, to put them in execution: which aduantage, the Enemy of mans safety hauing gotten, hee cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth him to iterate, and augment his transgression, vntill his heart growes hardned, and his conscience lose the sence and feeling of sinne.</p>
               <p>And so it comes to passe, that hee, who made no account of the transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory things of this life, and was tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:20921:29"/>
with the guilt of such, as the world accounts most veniall sinnes; before he was allured vnto the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells of the vngodly</hi>: hauing <hi>walked</hi> a little in them; steps suddenly into the <hi>way of sinners.</hi> Which is a great broad path, that leades downe a steepe hill, vntill (without the great mercy of God) he ariue at the <hi>seat of the scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> or the chaire of obstinate impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency: and when hee is once so low, and seated there; the hill of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance prooues so steep, that hee neuer returnes again; but there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth in a desperate estate.</p>
               <p>Hereby then wee are taught,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doct.</hi>
                  </note> that if wee will bee preserued from the danger of sinne, we must auoyd the custome of sinne; yea, the first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticements, &amp; least occasions therof; and not presume vpon our owne strength: for, hee that is content to heare euill <hi>counsell,</hi> tempts God; and is not sure, whether he will therfore
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:20921:30"/>
draw his grace from him, and suffer him to bee deluded by it. Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence; if it be not resisted, will turne to action; action, to iteration; and, at last, comes hardnesse of heart: for, he that feeles in himselfe, the euill motions of lust, and can hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine them, hauing no obiects to entice him; how much lesse, will he bee able to curb them, if hee come, where hee may haue the beauty, and wantonnesse of another, to inflame him? Or, if he could not bridle his affections before he had committed vncleannesse, when hee had more grace, more shame, more denials, and many more stops, to hold him backe, from wickednesse: Alas!why should any man thinke it possible, for him to forsake it, at his owne pleasure, when hee hath put himselfe out of the way of vertue; and hath neither inward grace, nor outward meanes, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent it? If, when thou hadst two
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:20921:30"/>
eyes, thou couldst not keep the way, being in it: canst thou hope, hauing neuer an eye left thee; to find it, when thou art out of it? No doubtlesse, if wee cannot keepe the sea from ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing vs, when the bankes are whole; surely, after they are once broken, the breach will encrease, and the flouds will come in, vntill they haue quite ouer-whelmed vs: vnlesse the mercifull hand of a greater pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, then our owne, help to recouer vs. A little water will extinguish a cole; but a flame is not so easily quenched. And therfore, we ought to kill these Cockatrices in the egge, and bee wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, not to giue the least aduantage, vnto the infirmities of euill. We haue examples enough to warne vs. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> was a good, and an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man; yet, giuing his eyes too much liberty, the euill <hi>counsels</hi> of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly affections, got by those win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, into his heart, and drew him
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:20921:31"/>
on in their <hi>walke,</hi> vntill they brought him to the <hi>way of sinners</hi>; where hee <hi>stood</hi> a long time, heaping one of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence vpon another: And had not God sent a <hi>Prophet</hi> of purpose, to call him out of that <hi>way</hi>; as holy a man as he was, he had neuer of himselfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, vntill he had taken vp his <hi>seat with the scorners.</hi> And yet, for all this, wee, euen wee weaklings, dare giue our selues any liberty. We can willingly runne thither,<note place="margin">The bold pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of man.</note> where wee know before, that we shall here see; nay, bee compelled, to bee partakers of sinne: and notwithstanding, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant our owne safeties.</p>
               <p>Some, I haue heard say; that in all companies, they could beare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues temperately, and among Drunkards, escape free, though all their companie failed of that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment: but alas, they see not their owne deformities; for, I haue knowne, that some of them, were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

               <p>Others, I haue heard, so confident in their owne vertues; that they haue professed themselues able, to resist the strongest temptations of inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency: and that, though they were all alone, with the most tempting beauty, and where they had the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test prouocations to folly; they could neuerthelesse keep themselues, from any dishonest act. This I haue heard: and beleeue me; I think such a thing possible, if they rely more on Gods grace, then their owne abilities; and came into this temptation, by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, without wilfull seeking, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring any such occasion. Yea, many (no doubt) haue escaped such trials. But, if any man depend vpon his owne chastity, and purposely tempt himselfe with opportunities, to doe euill; hee, walkes <hi>the way</hi> which God approoues not: and therefore it shall

The bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed man; meditateth on the Law of the LORD, <hi>day</hi> and <hi>night</hi>; that is: He pondereth all the misteries of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>; as they were promised, figured, and prophecied of, in the old <hi>Testament</hi> (which, as the <hi>Night,</hi> shadowed them ouer) and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth and confesseth them, as they were fulfilled in the new <hi>Testament</hi>; which was the <hi>Day</hi> that made them

For, many can bee content, perhaps, to spare some lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time in the Day, for the meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods word: but there are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few, that will breake a sleepe; and arise at night, with <hi>Dauid,</hi> to praise God: many can be content, whilest they gayne any outward benefit, or preferrement by their profession; to be hot and earnest in the study there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: but few dare abide, the blacke and terrible night of persecution. Nay, a little aduersity, or worldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience, cooles all their zeale. Hypocrites by <hi>Day,</hi> that is; openly in the eyes of the world; will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry forward, and seeme to be stout professors: but, in the <hi>Night,</hi> that is,

secretly, and by themselues; where none but God is witnesse: they can laugh at their owne dissembling; and with those people, of whom God speakes by the Prophet <hi>Malachi,</hi> they say thus: <hi>It is in vaine to serue God;<note place="margin">

               <p>Out of this verse; I doe obserue these things. First, that there is no true happinesse, without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God; and the continuall meditation of his word. And that those, who are sincerely adicted to his seruice, and the loue of his <hi>Truth,</hi>

For, the end to which God created the soule of man, was (as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith) That she might know him; in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, loue him; and in louing, enioy him: wherein consisteth perfect <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse,</hi> neuer to be lost againe; and that, which is principally meant in this <hi>Psalme.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Doctrines,</hi> that we may gather

                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2.</note>Secondly, in that it is sayd. The Blessed is as the Tree, planted <hi>by the riuers of waters:</hi> Wee are taught, what the instrumentall causes of our saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are; euen the Word of God, &amp; his blessed Sacraments.<note place="margin">What the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters signifie.</note> For, by the <hi>Springs,</hi> or <hi>Riuers of waters,</hi> are those allegorically vnderstood (as I sayd before) &amp; in that, they are sayd to be planted; thereby, wee also gather further, that such as are out of the Church, till they bee there seated, by the fountaines of (life and inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the mysticall body of <hi>Christ</hi>)

For, if wee bee trees of his Vineyard, wee cannot but bee sensible, of the sweet graces and operations of his Spirit: and shall not be found barren, of those spirituall fruits, which God wil looke for, in their due time. And be assured, that if wee bee vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; though wee carry neuer so many faire leaues of hypocrisie, to couer our sterility: we shal one day bee stript of them, and cast into the fire.</p>

which would be a blessed man, ought to auoyd all manner of sinne, loue Gods Word: meditate it, practise it, goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in that practise, bring forth fruits of righteousnesse; and continue vnto the end of his life, in that course.</hi>

with the barren fig-Tree. They are in nothing answerable to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the well planted Tree, here spoken of: but vngodly men, and Hypocrites, for the most part, yeeld no fruit at all. If they bring forth any; it is not good. And then it is no better then if they were vnfruitfull: <hi>For euery Tree that bringeth not forth good fruite,</hi>

But it is with the fruit of other mens labours. Yea, they leaue many goodly shewes of Charity behinde them; with that which had beene, with extreme couetousnesse and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, torne, as it were, out of the throates of their poore Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:20921:53"/>
Or if we should grant that it was their owne fruite they gaue; yet, it would be found to come out of season, and when there is no great neede of it: whereas a cup of cold water; giuen vnto a poore man in extremity: comes in better season, then a great deale of vaine liberality at other times. But, if wee should yeeld them this; that their fruite came in <hi>season</hi>;<note place="margin">The World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings season in which hee brings fruite.</note> it is in their owne <hi>season</hi> then: And when is that?

For, most commonly, for one honest man that shall satisfie his necessity among them; two Russians shall be made drunke. Or else their <hi>season</hi> is, when they may take occasion to make most shew to the world, of the see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming good they doe: like the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:20921:54"/>

                     <hi>Math.</hi> 6.2.</note> when the Axe is set vnto the roote of the Tree. Then; when the leaues of their youth, and prosperity are fallen off; the branches quite wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered; the bodie rotten, ready to stinke with putrifaction; and they in case no more to hoard vp, or keepe it vnto themselues; then (if the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell</hi> doe not come before they be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, and carry them away by the Rootes; as sometime he serueth old Trees in the Forrest) it may so fall out, that they leaue a few vnseasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fruits behind them: which often, in fine painted Almeshouses; make shew of more reliefe, then is halfe performed.</p>
               <p>Nor are the vngodly, in respect of their vnfruitfulnesse, or vntimelinesse in bearing fruite (onely) so contrary to the righteous: but euen their

               <p>Thus; exceeding elegantly, hath the Prophet described the misery of the wicked, by opposing it vnto the felicitie of the Iust.

                  </note>And here I could shew, how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the wicked may, for diuerse reasons, be likened vnto <hi>Chaffe.</hi> As in regard of that lightnesse, which makes them inconstantly carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, with euery vanity: or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of their sterility, with such like.

To wit, that the enemies, and oppressors of Gods Children; with all other vngodly men (though they be admired of the world, and seeme mighty and vnmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable in their owne haughty opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) are, (neuertheles indeed) poore base things; meere <hi>Chaffe.</hi> Nay, the worst and lightest of it: euen that which is scattered euery way with the winde. Or worse, if worse may be: For, they are not onely
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:20921:55"/>
vnsetled, and restlesly driuen too and fro, in their owne vaine practises; or tumbled vp and downe by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered furie of their miserable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: but their riches, honours, powers, and <hi>their very place of being</hi> (as <hi>Dauid</hi> saith) <hi>shall decay, and be no more found.</hi> For, the terrible winde of Gods wrath, shall puffe all, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to euerlasting perdition. Yea, Gods iudgement will rush vpon them on a suddaine, and inuisibly, as a wind: which shall come they know not from whence; and carrie them they know not whether. Nor shall their strength, eminence, or greatnesse, defend them. But, as the winde makes most hauock among tall Cedars, on high Mountaines: So, shall their pride and loftinesse, make them more subiect to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest of Gods indignation. As appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in <hi>Pharaoh, Nebuchadonezor, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>; and such other. But some may
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:20921:56"/>
say; many vngodly men liue free from all those miseries and crosses here spoken off. Truely, it seemes so for a time; but the greater will be their sorrow at the last. Nay, I am perswaded, that euen in this life, and at the best; they haue so much bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse, to make vnsauorie all their delights:<note place="margin">The vnhappy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men in this life.</note> as, if we could look into the hearts and consciences, of those that seeme happiest men to the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. I beleeue we should discouer so much horror, and disquietnesse; as would make vs set light by our discontentments. For, many of them, amid their aboundance of wealth and honours; are more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered with toyes; then a constant Christian is, with his greatest afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And if trifles will not moue them; they haue matters of greater consequence to disturbe their rest. One grieues, to see the familie, which he thought to make honourable, by
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:20921:56"/>
his owne pollicy; quite rooted out by the improuidence of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: Yea, the miserable Catiue, liues to behold his sonnes prodigali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, consume his vsury; and yet hath not the power to afford himselfe the benefit of his owne labours, neither to doe one good deede, that may purchase a prayer for him; vntill it is too late. Another, hath labour'd for the applause of the people; and with vexation of spirit, comes to heare his name made the iust subiect of Libels; and himselfe reputed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious in the common-wealth. One, is sicke, for some disgrace receiued from his Prince. A second, grieued with the vnkindenes of those whom he thought his best friends. A third, mad at the pride of his equall. A fourth, ready to hang himselfe for the insolence of his inferiour. A fift, pines with enuying at his superiour. A sixt, sleepes not for desire of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:20921:57"/>
A seauenth, trembles through feare of losing his office. The eighth, hath a wife that is more shame, and discontent vnto him, then all these. And, which is worse then that too; he knowes not what shall become of him at last. For, sometime he thinkes that men die like beasts, without hope of another life. And then, it grieues him, that he must for euer, leaue the world, which he so much loued. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while, he remembers he hath heard of a <hi>God</hi>; and <hi>a Day of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Which, putteth him into such a desperat feare; that he is neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but his heart quakes; and his guilty Conscience so stings &amp; threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens him, with hell and damnation; that hee sometime wisheth hee were indeede, realy <hi>dust,</hi> or <hi>Chaffe</hi>; and that, the winde might scatter him into nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oh God! that I were able so to scrue
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:20921:57"/>
this, into the hearts of worldlings; as to make their muddy apprehensions, more sensible of their vnhappinesse: and allure them, to seeke for that true and perfect felicitie, which is here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised. But alas! it is beyond my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. For the whole world (almost) hath runne through all the degrees of wickednesse; and the greatest part, are become</hi> Benchers, <hi>in that damnable society of</hi> Scorners<hi>: with whom, it is impossible to preuaile. Nay, my God; would thou mightst bee pleased (though it were but so farre, to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mee with thy spirit) that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of these things, might e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer continue in my selfe, so feruent, as at sometimes they be. For, by that meanes, I should not onely; neuer more againe, be carried away by those vanities and infirmities, whereunto youth and the frailty of my condition is prone; but become also, so highly delighted with the contemplation, and hope
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:20921:58"/>
of that incomparable blessednesse which is prepared for the louers of thy Law: that the worlds minions shold see, I did not meerely in word; but truely in deede; neglect, and despise all those things, which they account eyther feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, or disasters in this life. Yea, they should perceiue me, so farre from thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king my selfe a miserable man; For being in pouerty, slandered, neglected, contemned, tortured, with such like: or, from imagining my selfe a happy man, in the fruition of that vaine fauour, honour, wealth, ease, fame,and respect, which they glorie in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as, they should with enuie be forced to confesse within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues; that, by a meanes which the world knew not, I had ariued at such felicitie; as in respect thereof, their happinesse, was but as dirt, and dung to Gold and Siluer. And perhaps also when they were in their greatest earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pompe: It should more vexe them, to behold me (whom they account misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:20921:58"/>
disdayning those things as triuiall, wherein they place their highest bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse; then it can delight, or content them, to possesse those pleasures or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments which they enioy. This, oh Lord were possible; if thou wouldst alwaies preserue in thy seruant, the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which at sometime thou vouch safest to bestow vpon me. But I am the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest of thy children; and I confesse that these good affections, and apprehensions, which I sometime haue of the blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse here promised: doe often; yea,too often faile in me. And then, I doe not onely shrinke as much as any other, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the burthen of temporall afflictions: but my heart is also intangled, with those desires, and preposterous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments, that vainest world-lings seeke after. Which weakenesse; I both heartily pray thee (Oh God) to heale in me; and surely beleeue also, that thou wilt doe it, when it shall be most for thy glory, and my furtherance, in the way

of truest</hi> Blessednesse. <hi>The thought whereof; hath now so highly transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me; that, I had almost forgotten what I had more to say, touching the infelicity of the wicked.</hi> But now I descend againe, to speake of them.</p>

against them, to their ouerthrow, at the generall <hi>Doome.</hi> For, so are these words, <hi>shall not stand,</hi> to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. And the phrase is not onely proper to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi>; but vsuall among the <hi>Latines,</hi> and vs also. <hi>Cicero</hi> hath, <hi>Causa cadere</hi>; which, is after the same manner of speaking: And <hi>Terence,</hi> where hee saith, <hi>Se, vix stetisse</hi>; meanes, that some of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles were scarse approued of, by the common people.

And although, here they may appeare powerfull; make great boast of their authority; and, perhaps, in our Courts of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on earth, be able to stand out, vntill they haue ruined the innocent (for, in any cause, fauours are to bee had, among the corrupted Iudges of this world.) Yet, in the generall <hi>Doome,</hi> when euery man shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare naked, without bribes; and before a Iudge, that can neuer be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. Alas! what will those things? those vain things, profit them, wherein they now glory?
