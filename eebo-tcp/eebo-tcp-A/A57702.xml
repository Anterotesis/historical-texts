         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Master Speaker,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou may remember the report
made about seven weeks since
by Master <hi>Woodward,</hi> of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from his Majesty sent out
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for drawing up
of certain <hi>Congideleers,</hi> for the
electing of five new Bishops,
whereof two are made and
consecrated; And that then I moved, for petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his Majesty to stay the making of them, but
other businesse of greater consequence for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
hindred my enlarging such Reasons as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of weight to stop the proceedings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them.</p>
            <p>And now, Master Speaker, under favour of this
honourable House, I intend to give you some fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ground of my opinion then, that it was not
neither is it yet convenient, as I under favour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
they should be made Bishops.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:96597:3"/>Master Speaker, You know the proceedings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
those Bishops which have beene great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents
in this State, and that we have prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to our Impeachment of them of high Treason,
which was a mayne ground of my opnion for the
then averting that intended businesse in making
these new Bishops, till that businesse was brought
to a period.</p>
            <p>And Master Speaker, I perswade my selfe that
there are as great Delinquents to their power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the inferiour Clergy, as the Bishops, I speak
not with an intent you should conceive that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
any ways upon the persons of any of these
that are elected or made, but that untill the other
impeached be proceeded against, either to their
condemnation or otherwise, as by the Parliament
they shall be found guilty, these new elected may
be awhile procrastinated and delayed.</p>
            <p>Master Speaker,</p>
            <p>We have (as occasion hath served us) had many
debates and arguments about the quite taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
of Bishops, and many divisions in the House
have been concerning the same, and although vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for their continuance, yet the manner of their
Government not determined of, then as (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
it can neither be requisite nor convenient to
make new Bishops till a certain forme of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
be fully concluded and setled by the
whole State of this Kingdome.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:96597:3"/>2. Secondly, Mr. Speaker, if wee should give
way to the making of these Bishops, great preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
may follow before wee can setle them in
such a government as may agree most for the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and safety both of this Kingdome, and the
fundamentall points and Principles of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Mr. Speaker, notwithstanding our procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
against Delinquents (both in Church and
State) how many Petitions and Complaints have
we daily received against pernitious, and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
tenents in Doctrine, besides scandalous and
slanderous aspersions delivered, by divers of the
Clergie in their Sermons, and otherwise, since the
sitting of this present Parliament, which out of
doubt are favoured, nay animated and incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by the Bishops, which doth much trouble ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
people, and is a great cause of their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in evill, and obstinate maliciousnesse of a
great many of good quality and estimation, and
then for new Bishops to be made (although per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
men of great Learning and Judgement) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Parliament hath fully agreed on the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of their Government, and proceedings to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
and punish such Delinquents as have beene
perverse instruments in the Church, to withdraw
the affections of many, (otherwise perhaps rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
well affected) from the right setling of
true Religion, with such Discipline congruent
thereunto, that should be the best meanes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the everlasting peace of King and People,
those inconveniencies and dangerous consequents
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96597:4"/>
that may happen, may be yet worse then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
we have had too much experience of.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly I conceive, the making of these Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
when they shall be admitted to sit in the
Lords house, their Votes there, although voted
downe in this House, yet not agreed unto by the
Lords, may be a great hinderance in our procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
to settle such a forme of Government in
Religion, as shall by the Parliament bee thought
requisite, they all of them contriving to continue
their old forme and power of Government, and
their Votes you know, Master Speaker, have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
much in that House, many of the Lords,
(not so many I could wish) being much inclined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, &amp; too willing to Complie with them
in their Designes, but I hope by Gods blessing,
and our indeavours, wee shall in time by degrees
remove such Impediments both in Church and
State as hinder our happy proceedings in redres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
such things that are amisse in the same.</p>
            <p>4. Fourthly, a fourth ground of my Opinion,
that I conceive to be of waight for the staying the
making of these Bishops, Mr. Speaker, is the Non-concurrence
amongst our selves concerning their
Consecration, which I desire may not bee Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive,
till the other things before mentioned for
the settlement of Religion, and punishment of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents
bee agreed unto; that then such as shall
be by this wise Councell of State thought fit to
beare any office in the Church in places of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
may be (by the same) tried and proved,
in their Learning, Judgement, and the holinesse of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96597:4"/>
their lives and conversations, that so having not
only able, but godly men, set in places of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
we may expect the well Government of the
inferiour Clergie.</p>
            <p>I desire, Mr. Speaker, not to bee misconceived
in this my speech concerning the stay of making
these Bishops yet unconsecrated, I speake not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their uncapablenesse or unworthinesse of
such places of Government, but that they are as
able and fit for the same as any other; But the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of my speech and humble motion is, that
only for the reasons before specified, they may
not yet be made and Consecrated, till such time as
all things for the well Government of the Church
be fully concluded and setled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Which God grant,
that having reformed all disorders both in
Church and State, we may every one sit
securely under his owne vine and
fig-tree, and reape and injoy
the fruit of his owne
labour.</p>
