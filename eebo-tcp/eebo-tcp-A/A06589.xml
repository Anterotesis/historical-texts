            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>O fayre <hi>Cynthia,</hi> why doe others terme thee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant,
whom I haue euer founde vnmoueable? Iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
tyme, corrupt manners, vnkind men, who finding
a constancy not to be matched, in my sweete Mistris,
haue christned her with the name of wauering, waxing,
and waning. Is shee inconstant that keepeth a setled
course, which since her first creation altereth not one
minute in her mouing? There is nothing thought more
admirable, or commendable in the sea, then the ebbing
and flowing, and shall the Moone, from whom the Sea
taketh this vertue, be accounted fickle for encreasing, &amp;
decreasing? Flowers in theyr buds, are nothing worth
till they be blowne, nor blossomes accounted till they be
ripe fruite, and shal we then say they be changeable, for
that they growe from seedes to leaues, from leaues to
buds, from buds to theyr perfection? then, why be not
twigs that become trees, children that become men, and
Mornings that grow to Euenings, termed wauering, for
that they continue not at one stay? I but <hi>Cynthia,</hi> being
in her fulnes, decayeth, as not delighting in her greatest
beautie, or withering when she should be most honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
When mallice cannot obiect any thing, folly will,
making that a vice, which is the greatest vertue. What
thing (my Mistris excepted) being in the pride of her
beauty, &amp; latter minute of her age, that waxeth young
againe? Tell mee <hi>Eumenides,</hi> what is hee that hauing a
Mistris of ripe yeeres, &amp; infinite vertues, great honors,
and vnspeakeable beauty, but woulde wish that shee
might grow tender againe? getting youth by yeeres, and
neuer decaying beauty, by time, whose fayre face, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:10262:4"/>
the Summers blase can scorch, nor VVinters blast
chappe, nor the numbring of yeeres breede altering of
colours. Such is my sweete <hi>Cynthia,</hi> whom tyme cannot
touch, because she is diuine, nor will offend because she
is delicate. O <hi>Cynthia,</hi> if thou shouldest alwaies conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
at thy fulnes, both Gods and men woulde conspire
to rauish thee. But thou to abate the pride of our affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
dost detract from thy perfections, thinking it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,

and then, to encrease our greefes, thou doost de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease

                  <p>O Fayre <hi>Cynthia,</hi> ô vnfortunate <hi>Endimion.</hi> Why
was not thy byrth as high as thy thoughts, or
her beautie lesse then heauenlie? or why are not thyne
honors as rare as her beautie? or thy fortunes as great as
thy deserts? Sweet <hi>Cynthia,</hi> how wouldst thou be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
how possessed? wil labours (patient of all extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties)
obtaine thy loue? There is no Mountain so steepe
that I will not climbe, no monster so cruell that I will
not tame, no action so desperate that I will not attempt.
Desirest thou the passions of loue, the sad and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholie
moodes of perplexed mindes, the not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
torments of racked thoughts? Beholde my sad
teares, my deepe sighes, my hollowe eyes, my broken
sleepes, my heauie countenaunce. Wouldst thou haue
mee vowde onelie to thy beautie and consume euerie
minute of time in thy seruice, remember my solitarie
life, almost these seauen yeeres, whom haue I entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
but mine owne thoughts, and thy vertues? What
companie haue I vsed but contemplation? Whom haue
I wondred at but thee? Nay whom haue I not contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb facs="tcp:10262:9"/>
for thee? Haue I not crept to those on whom I
might haue troden, onelie because thou didst shine vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them? Haue not iniuries beene sweet to mee, if thou
vouchsafest I should beare them? Haue I not spent my
golden yeeres in hopes, waxing old with wishing, yet
wishing nothing but thy loue. With <hi>Tellus,</hi> faire <hi>Tellus,</hi>
haue I dissembled, vsing her but as a cloake for mine
affections, that others seeing my mangled and disorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
minde, might thinke it were for one that loueth me,
not for <hi>Cynthia,</hi> whose perfection alloweth no compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
nor comparison.</p>
                  <p>In the midst of these distempred thoughts of myne,
thou art not onelie iealous of my truth, but careles, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicious,
and secure: which strange humor maketh my
minde as desperate as thy conceits are doubtfull. I am
none of those Wolues that barke most, when thou shy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
brightest. But that fish, (thy fish <hi>Cynthia</hi> in the
floode <hi>Aranis)</hi> which at thy waxing is as white as the

darknes. I am that <hi>Endimion</hi> (sweet <hi>Cynthia)</hi> that haue
carryed my thoughts in equall ballance with my actions,
being alwaies as free from imagining ill, as enterpry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing;
That <hi>Endimion,</hi> whose eyes neuer esteemed anie
thing faire, but thy face, whose tongue termed nothing
rare but thy vertues, and whose hart imagined nothing
miraculous, but thy gouernment. Yea that <hi>Endimion,</hi>
who diuorsing himselfe from the amiablenes of all La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
the brauerie of all Courts, the companie of al men,
hath chosen in a solitarie Cell to liue, onely by feeding
on thy fauour, accounting in the worlde (but thy selfe)
nothing excellent, nothing immortall; thus maist thou
see euerie vaine sinew, muscle, and artery of my loue, in
which there is no flatterie, nor deceipt; error, nor arte.
But soft, here commeth <hi>Tellus,</hi> I must turne my other

loue crept into his mouth before he could close it, and

                  <p>Aske? so I will: and what shall I doo but aske,
and whome should I aske but <hi>Semele,</hi> the possessing of
whose person, is a pleasure that cannot come within the
compasse of comparison, whose golden lockes seeme
most curious, when they seeme most carelesse, whose
sweete lookes seeme most alluring, when they are most
chaste: and whose wordes the more vertuous they are,
<pb facs="tcp:10262:20"/>
the more amorous they bee accounted. I pray thee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
when I shall first meete with fayre <hi>Semele,</hi> dash my
delight with some light disgrace, least imbracing sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
beyond measure, I take a surfit without recure: let
her practise her accustomed coynesse, that I may dyet
my seife vpon my desires: otherwise the fulnesse of my
ioyes will diminish the sweetnesse, and I shall perrish by
them before I possesse them.</p>
                  <p>Why doe I trifle the time in words? The least minute
beeing spent in the getting of <hi>Semele,</hi> is more worth
then the whole worlde: therefore let mee aske. What
nowe <hi>Eumenides?</hi> Whether art thou drawn? Hast thou
forgotten both friendship and duetie? Care of <hi>Endimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and the commaundement of <hi>Cynthia?</hi> Shall hee dye
in a leaden sleepe, because thou sleepest in a golden

                  <p>Shall I not hazard the losse of a friend, for the obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of her for whome I woulde often loose my selfe?
Fonde <hi>Eumenides,</hi> shall the intycing beautie of a most
disdainfull Ladie, bee of more force then the rare fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of a tryed friend? The loue of men to women is
a thing common, and of course: the friendshippe of
man to man infinite, and immortall. Tush, <hi>Semele</hi>

                     <hi>Eumenides,</hi> release <hi>Endimion,</hi> for all thinges
(friendship excepted) are subiect to fortune: Loue is
but an eye worme, which onely tickleth the heade with
hopes, and wishes: friendshippe the image of eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb facs="tcp:10262:20"/>
in which there is nothing moueable, nothing mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheeuous.
As much difference as there is betweene
Beautie and Vertue, bodies and shadowes, colours and
life: so great oddes is there betweene loue and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe.</p>
                  <p>Loue is a <hi>Camelion,</hi> which draweth nothing into the
mouth but ayre, and nourisheth nothing in the bodie
but lunges: beleeue mee <hi>Eumenides,</hi> Desire dyes in the
same moment that Beautie sickens, and Beautie fadeth
in the same instant that it flourisheth. When aduersities
flowe, then loue ebbes: but friendship standeth stifflie
in stormes. Time draweth wrinckles in a fayre face, but
addeth fresh colours to a fast friende, which neither
heate, nor cold, nor miserie, nor place, nor destiny, can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or diminish. O friendship of all things the most rare,
and therefore most rare because most excellent, whose
comforts in misery is alwaies sweet, and whose counsels
in prosperitie are euer fortunate. Vaine loue, that onely
comming neere to friendship in name, woulde seeme to
be the same, or better, in nature.</p>

alas poore Gentleman, hast thou spent thy youth in
sleepe, that once vowed all to my seruice. Hollow eyes?
gray haires? wrinckled cheekes? and decayed limmes?
Is it destinie, or deceite that hath brought this to passe?
If the first, who could preuent thy wretched starres. If
the latter, I would I might knowe thy cruell enemie. I
fauoured thee <hi>Endimion</hi> for thy honor, thy vertues, thy

might haue thee staied, and nowe are thy dayes ended

a man mortall, so I hope can it be no shame to tell
with whom, my Ladie beeing heauenlie. Your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
committed to my charge fayre <hi>Tellus,</hi> whose beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in the same moment tooke my hart captiue, that I
vndertooke to carry her bodie prisoner. Since that time
haue I found such combats in my thoughts betweene
loue and dutie, reuerence and affection, that I coulde
neyther endure the conflict, nor hope for the conquest.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cynthia</speaker>
                  <p>In loue? A thing farre vnsitting the name of

                  <p>Feeling this continuall warre, I thought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by parlee to yeeld, then by certaine danger to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
I vnfolded to <hi>Tellus</hi> the depth of my affections,
and framed my tongue to vtter a sweet tale of loue, that
was wont to found nothing but threats of warre. Shee
too fayre to be true, and too false for one so fayre, after
a nice deniall, practised a notable deceyt, commaunding
me to remooue <hi>Endimion</hi> from this Caban, and carrie
him to some darke Caue, which I seeking to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish,
founde impossible. And so by Fayries or fiendes
haue beene thus handled.</p>

alwaies practising of some deceites? In sooth <hi>Corsites</hi>
thy face is novve too foule for a Louer, and thine hart
too fonde for a Souldiour. You may see when VVarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors
become wantons, howe theyr manners alter with
theyr faces. Is it not a shame <hi>Corsites,</hi> that hauing
liued so long in <hi>Mars</hi> his Campe, thou shouldest now
bee rockt in <hi>Venus</hi> Cradle. Doost thou we are <hi>Cupids</hi>
Quiuer at thy gyrdle, and make Launces of lookes?
Well <hi>Corsites</hi> rouse thy selfe, and be as thou hast beene,
and let <hi>Tellus</hi> who is made all of loue, melt herselfe in her

verie mischeeuous, who in the one hande carryed a
knife, with which shee offered to cut my throte: and in
the other a looking-glasse, wherein seeing how ill anger
became Ladies, shee refrained from intended violence.
She was accompanied with other Damsels, one of which
with a sterne countenance, &amp; as it were with a setled ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
engrauen in her eyes, prouoked her to execute mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheefe:
an other with visage sad and constant onelie in
sorrow, with her armes crossed, and watery eyes, seemed
to lament my fortune, but durst not offer to preuent the
force. I started in my sleepe, feeling my verie veines to
swell, and my sinewes to stretch with feare, and such a

such a diuine Maiestie, mingled with a sweete mildenes,
that I was rauished with the sight aboue measure, and
<pb facs="tcp:10262:29"/>
wished that I might haue enioied the sight without end,

<hi>Endimion,</hi> receiue this booke with three leaues, in which

that he offered mee the booke, which I reiected: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
moued with a disdainefull pittie, hee rent the first
leafe in a thousand shiuers, the second time hee offered
it, which I refused also: at which bending his browes,
and pitching his eyes fast to the ground, as though they
were fixed to the earth, and not againe to be remoued:
then sodainlie casting them vp to the heauens, he tore in
a rage the second leafe, and offered the booke only with
one leafe. I know not whether feare to offende, or desire
to knowe some strange thing, moued mee: I tooke the
booke, and so the olde man vanished.</p>

with striuing bleede themselues to death. There might
I see ingratitude with an hundred eyes, gazing for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites,
and with a thousand teeth, gnawing on the
bowelles wherein shee was bred. Trecherie stoode all
cloathed in white, with a smyling countenance, but
both her handes bathed in blood. Enuye with a pale
and megar face, (whose bodie was so leane, that one
might tell all her bones, and whose garment was so

totterd, that it was easie to number euery thred) stood
shooting at starres, whose dartes fell downe againe
on her owne face. There might I beholde Drones,
or Beetles, I knowe not howe to terme them creeping
vnder the winges of a princely Eagle, who being carried
into her neast, sought there to sucke that veine,
that woulde haue killed the Eagle. I mused that
thinges so base, shoulde attempt a facte so barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,

that (not to be expressed, yet alwaies to be felt) Loue?
which breaketh the braines, and neuer brooseth the

fumes to Aetna, vallies to Alpes, Ants to Eagles, and
nothing could be compared to my beautie but his loue,
and eternitie. Thus drawing a smooth shoe vppon a
crooked foote, hee made me beleeue, that (which all of

though in maiestie, beautie, vertue, and dignitie, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
humbled and yeelded my selfe to <hi>Cynthia,</hi> yet in

Such a difference hath the Gods sette between our

loue. My vnspotted thoughts, my languishing bodie,

onelie wishing of impossibilities: with imagination of
which, I will spende my spirits, and to my selfe that no
creature may heare, softlie call it loue. And if any vrge
to vtter what I whisper, then will I name it honor. From
this sweet conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plation if I be not drinen, I shall liue of al

            <p>A Man walking abroade, the wind and
Sunne stroue for soueraignty, the one
with his blast, the other with his beames.
The wind blew hard, the man wrapped his
garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t about him harder: it blustred more
strongly, he then girt it fast to him: I cannot
preuaile sayd the wind. The Sunne casting
her Christall beames, began to warme the
man: he vnlosed his gowne. yet it shined
brighter: he then put it off. I yeelde sayd
the winde, for if thou continue shining, he
will also put off his cote.</p>
            <p>Dread Soueraigne, the malicious that
seeke to ouerthrowe vs with threats, do but
stiffen our thoughts, and make them stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
in stormes: but if your Highnes vouch
safe with your fauorable beames to glaunce
vpon vs, we shall not onlie stoope, but with
all humilitie, lay both our handes and
hearts, at your Maiesties feete.</p>
