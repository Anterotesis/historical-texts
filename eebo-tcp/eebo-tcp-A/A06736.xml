            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Whence it comes to be a thing most delightfull, that so vnciuill and rude a Nation, should seeme to yield vs a person of so gentle behauiour, &amp; celestiall manners.

Saluation, making a great deale more reckoning thereof, then of the swelling Literature o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In schoole he lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer, at home the feare of God; &amp; continually through his profit, did satisfy both Mother and Mayster. Which thing should not seeme to others to be any whit vntrue; he hauing through espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall fauour from heauen, the lot to haue so good a Soule, which made him as well docible, as strangely amiable and gracious.</p>
               <p>From Mothers breast, insteed of milke, he sucked the waters of wisedome, and day by day, became more wise. More wise, shall we say, or more Holy? If I say, both the one and other, I should not much repent me, because I should haue sayd but truth. For manners he was graue, a child indeed yeares, but voyd of childish sportfullnes: and howbeit, held in veneration and admiration of all, yet became he not thereby, as generally others do haughty or insolent, but rather quiet and submisse with all meckenes. He was not impatient of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment; not stubborne to discipline; not dull for studies; and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally not delighted with games, the proper and general affect of that age: so as in learning, which was competent for him, he out-stript all his equalls of the same age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in Goodnes of life and purchase of vertues, he excelled as many, as taught him; and that not only through the industry of his Mother, but euen also by the Vnction of the spirit; wherwith being interiourly solicited &amp; pushed on, he was neuer backward in diuine Exercises; as to retire himselfe in solitude; to meditate the holy law of <hi>Christ;</hi> to make o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And wheras from publique fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting of Churches he was partly hindred through schoole, and partly kept backe through a certayne respectfull modesty; yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare he not the lesse, to lift vp his Mynd to the supernall Father, &amp; to adore him euen likewise with exteriour gestures, wheresoeuer in secret he could find occasion there vnto: being at such tymes very cautious and circumspect to eschew vayne glory, the most certaine poyson of vertues.</p>
               <p>There lyes not farre off from <hi>Ardmach,</hi> a village whither his Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster went often to walke, without other company, the this beloued Disciple.

                  </gap>lyly would he be putting himselfe agayne somewhat handsomely on the way: and with so pious a theft, would the blessed youth from tyme to tyme be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his Guide. It boots not heere to relate all the acts, which made his greener yeares very illustrious and admirable. My penne makes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Being now arriued at last somwhat towards the end of the first arts, and thirsting after the grauer Sciences, being moued through the fame of a learned Doctour, he went his wayes with great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; though somewhat farre off, to be acquainted with him. But finding him at his entring into the howse very busy, scoring of the wall very impertinently with an awle, being disgusted with such a leuity, and immediately pulling backe his foote from thence, he had no list to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>te him any more; so much (howbeit neuer so greedy of Learning he were) he preferred honesty before knowledge. In this sort then, he passed ouer his childish yeares, and yet in Youth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned he still, as it were, the same tenour of candour &amp; purity; sau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> only that together with yeares, did Wisedome and grace, both with God and men alike increase in him: with this besides, that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally there beganne more high and sage reflections, and discourses to awake in his breast. For that the prudent youth beholding on the one side the malignity of the world, and on the other the quality of the Spirit which swayed within his mind; came more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> once to speake within himselfe in this sort.</p>
               <p>My spirit is no whit secular; for what hath it to do therewith, since there is no more resemblance betweene them, then betweene night and day? Mine seemes, to proceed from God, nor am I igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the gifts, which he hath vouchsafed me. From him, do I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the stole of innocency I enioy, with the flower of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency in me preserued hitherto. From him, that glory of myne so much securer, as it is more secret, consisting wholy in the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the proper conscience. None of all which possessions can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide without much dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger vnder the Prince of this naughty world. Besides, I go carrying so great a treasure in an earthen vessell, and there is good reason to feare, least it come to take a knock, and be broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; the Oyle of gladnes within be vnhappily spilt. And how
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:12171:12"/>
is it possible not to take a knock among so many stones, &amp; amidst so many rocks of this way, &amp; life so full of turnings, windings, &amp; rubs? And shall I seeme in a moment to be loosing of all these blessings of holy sweetenes, wherewith the Eternall Goodnes from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hath preuented me? Rather I resolue to secure the same in the hand of him, who hath giuen it me, &amp; my selfe likewise therewith; since also I am his, I will temporally loose my life for not to loose it eternally. And where may the same with my being, &amp; all what I am, be in more safety, then in the right hand of the giuer? For who is more wary then he in keeping? who more potent in deffending, and more faythfull in restoring? He will keepe it safely; he wil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store it in his tyme. I shal not loose a iot of whatsoeuer I shall seeme to distribute in workes of piety. Perhaps moreouer, I may looke for a good returne. This magnificent Bancher, is wont to redouble with vsury, the things which he hath giuen of courtesy. Such were the thoughts of <hi>S.

               <p>THERE was a holy man in <hi>Ardmach, Imarius</hi> by name, of a very austere life, and a most implacable chastiser of his proper flesh; he dwelt reclused in a Cell, neere the great Church, in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming there very hard penau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with continual prayer. To this man went <hi>S. Malachy</hi> to be instructed, and guided in a spirituall life, by him, though lyuing, yet voluntarily condemned to the graue. And though from a Child (as we said) he had God himselfe for Maister in the art of louing God, yet now more ancient, as a rude disciple, would he needs submit himselfe to the rule of a man. Heere now let those note well this point, who vndertake to teach the same which they haue not learned, and go gathering and multiplying Scholers without euer hauing been at schoole; blind guiders of the blind. And if <hi>S. Malachyes</hi> example suffice them not, yet let them marke what the <hi>Apostle S. Paul</hi> practised. For had not he, trow you receiued the Ghospell from Christ himselfe? And yet thought he it not amisse to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate the same with men, least his way &amp; labors might prooue otherwise in vaine. Where <hi>S.

me lesse. And let him who vnderstands it otherwise, beware his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity proue not presumption.</p>
               <p>But returne we now to the fact of <hi>S. Malachy,</hi> whose fame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incontinently spread, all were astonished at such a nouelty; but yet all not discoursed alike thereof.

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> disdaynefully blamed him, for putting himselfe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>an enterprize, so farre beyond his forces. But they wrongfully layd the blame v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him, while he could not be culpable of temerity, who so adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the counsayle of the Prophet, saying: <hi>It is good for him, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Malachy</hi> seemed so strait a way, as had not been seene to be trod by others steps; nor vntill that tyme, had any Student of the same Academy euer entred in. So as he was faygne to be exercised a good while with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a fellow of anyranke, sitting in silence and submission, all the while at the feete of <hi>Imarius,</hi> and refining his vnderstanding &amp; will with entire Obedience, with perpetnall mortification, and with al those industries and arts, which easily conduct a soule, that is both feruent and meeke, to the top of Euangelicall perfection. It was not long neuertheles, that others being enflamed through his example, began to giue themselues to the selfe same Discipline they seemed to abhor so much the other day: In so much as where he was soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary at first, and the only so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of his Father, very soone he came to be the eldest of many Brothers; but as he was more ancient in Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation, so was he more sublime in Conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plation. Whence he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the Archbishop <hi>Celsus,</hi> as likewise to <hi>Imarius,</hi> who by this tyme knew him well, to be worthy of Sacred <hi>Deaconship,</hi> &amp; so they ordayned him.</p>
               <p>From that tyme this new Leuit, seemed to buckle himselfe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliquely to all the workes of piety, but especially to those which are ordinarily held in most contempt with others. And with particular diligence would he attend to the Funerals &amp; Exequies of the Poore decea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And therin our <hi>Toby</hi> had the temptation of a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cked woman, or rather of the ancient Serpent, by her meanes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a Sister of his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> esteeming it a dishonour to her, that he should imploy himselfe in such affayres. What dost thou (would she say)

And so in this sort would he be cheerefully pursuing that Exercise, so gratefull to the eyes of the Diuine Goodnes. And for his perseuerance therein, his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Superiours holding him moreouer to be worthy, of <hi>Priesthood,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay promoted him there to, notwithstanding all the resistance which he could make. <hi>S.

Wherto it helped not a little, that <hi>S. Malachy</hi> from a youth had attended to his part in Musique. But that which more imports, he renewed the vse of the Sacraments, and in particular of <hi>Confession, Confirmation,</hi> and of <hi>Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> things that eyther out of malice, or ignorance, had bene heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore as it were, wholy forgotten, and dismissed.</p>

Now there being a great discord risen betweene <hi>Cormacus</hi> King of <hi>Momonia,</hi> &amp; a wicked brother of his; the King being vanquished in battayle, and thurst out of his seate, made his recourse in perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Bishop <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> to be succoured by him; not for recouering his scepter, but rather to saue his soule, as being timourous of him, who takes away the spirit of Princes, &amp; as very much alienated from sheding of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian bloud for temporall interests. At the newes of such a Ghest, did <hi>Malcus</hi> make preparation to receiue him with due honour: but he would not consent thereto, affirming his intention was to liue with him in a priuate and quiet manner; and laying aside all memory of royall pompes, to betake himselfe to the discipline, and fare of the other <hi>Canonists.

And in regard the Seruant of <hi>Christ</hi> loued the soule, as much as he hated the imperfections of his Sister, without delay he returned to his suffrages so intermitted. Nor was it long ere the dead Woman appeared to him, vpon the thre shall of the Church (but yet bard from entring in) and apprelled in black. But her Brother perseuering still in assisting her without euer omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any morning, wherein some Sacrifice was not offered vp for her, he espyed her very soon in a grayish gowne, within the Church indeed, but not admitted as yet to the Aultar.

               <p>We must vnderstand, that in a place of those parts, called <hi>Benchor,</hi> was anciently founded a Monastery, by a certayne holy Abbot, called <hi>Congellus,</hi> with so prosperous increase, as well of meanes, as of subiects, as that from thence, as from a fruitefull <hi>Metropolis</hi> were sent, as it were, infinite Colonies into diuers regions. And it is a constant rumour, that one child only of that Blessed <hi>Congregation,</hi> called <hi>Siluanus,</hi> had planted alone in diuers countryes, full a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Conuents.

With so cruell a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, that most noble Seminary though quite extinct, yet the inhabitants notwithstanding, ceased not successiuely, to create by a certayne forme, a Secular <hi>Abbot,</hi> who without any thought of Religion, attended only to the gathering vp of rents, and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them sacrilegiously to his proper vses.</p>
               <p>In this tyme now, <hi>S. Malachy</hi> had an Vncle (of whome we spake before) who had this rich Abbay in his hands: who eyther prickt with a Synderisis, or sting of conscience, or moued with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples and Exhortations of his wise Nephew, determined while he had space for holesome pennance, not only to quit his hands of such administration, but to renounce the world outright, and to apply that huge benefice, together with his person to diuine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and to the institutes of <hi>S. Malachy;</hi> who notwithstanding he were vnder the direction of <hi>Imarius</hi> had now begunne to haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny imitatours and followers. The man of God being glad of such a Vocation, did voluntarily accept of the care of his Vncle, and the plot, for some restauration of the building. But as one tenacious of the pouerty of Christ, would by no meanes admit of the possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, suffering the people to depute another to such affayres. The which afterwards (as we shall see in its place) repayed the benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the diuine man, with abominable ingratitude. The renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation being made in this sort, and the possession taken of the holy place, <hi>S.

and that I be licenced to returne agayne to my present Spouse, and to my most beloued <hi>Pouerty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the last and most resolute answere of <hi>S. Malachy,</hi> Whereby very cleerely may be seene a great purity conioyned with an equall Fortitude; since on the one side without simulation he fled honour; and for iustice sake on the other, he feared not death.</p>
               <p>In summe, by no meanes for prayers or threats, would he seeme to yield his assent thereto, vntill such tyme as promise and firme word was giuen him, vpon the conditions propounded. Assoone as he was in security therof, he finally accommodated himselfe to assume the charge; &amp; so much the rather, as besides the vnanimous, and perseuering instances of such like personages, it seemed to him he had yet some other manifest signes of the diuine will: whereof one is worthy of ponderation, and very considerable. There ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him (euen about the sicknes of <hi>Celsus,</hi> while he was then a farre off, and knew nothing thereof) a woman of a tall stature, and of a graue aspect, who being demaunded by him, who she was, made him answere, <hi>she was the Wife of Celsus,</hi> and without more ado, putting the staffe of gouernment into his hand, she sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daynely vanished. And within a few dayes after, while <hi>Celsus</hi> now drew neere to his death, he really sent him indeed in signe of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, a rod euen iust of the figure of the same Fantastique one. The memory whereof, and the correspondency of the tymes, was a matter of much moment in the mynd of <hi>S. Malachy,</hi> and iustly made him feare, least standing out longer, in such an occasion, he might seeme apparently to wrastle with God himselfe. He accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted then the charge; but yet without euer entring into the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whiles the intruder liued; and the same he did, for not to giue on his part any manner of perturbation, by which otherwise they might hap to loose their liues, to whome he was rather come to affoard the same. So as for the space of two yeares, (for so long that ambitious man escaped) did <hi>S. Malachy</hi> attend to exercise the office, abroad through the Prouince.</p>

               <p>The Diocesse of <hi>Conerthen</hi> of ancient tymes, had two Episcopal Seates; but afterwards through the couetousnes, and ambition of a great <hi>Incumbent,</hi> they were confounded together, and reduced to one only.

Where are they now, who so earnestly contend about their lymits and bounds? Who meerely for a base cottage, or a plot of ground, do wage Law, and stirre vp such fearefull tragedyes? But let vs desist from entring into such manner of discourses, and rather proceede to declare the rest of the life of this great Saint. From Metropolitan and Primate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> being thus made Bishop of <hi>Dune,</hi> the first thing he endeauours, is to haue (as he was wont) a flourishing Colledge about him of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Clerks.</p>
               <p>And behold now another tyme, how our new Souldyer of <hi>Christ,</hi> puts himself agayne into spiritual combats; he harnesseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with complete armour of <hi>Mortification,</hi> and perpetuall Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, although by this his desire, he seemed to obteyne the merit, rather then the effect; it being impossible for him to deny his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, counsaile, and presence to such a number of persons, as eyther touched with good inspirations, or tempted with sundry temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, repaired to him as to a fafe refuge &amp; true Oracle. Besides which, the obligation he had of trauayling through the Prouince, to sow the word of God, to visite the parishes, and to ordeyne all things as one of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> did employ him not a little. And commonly there was none would say vnto him; In whose authority do you this? so great was the opinion and credit he purchased; partly through the life he lead, partly also for the signes &amp; Miracles which he wrought. And yet for all that, while it seemed to him, that he could not with security promote so high affayres, without the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse commission of the holy <hi>Apostolike Sea;</hi> he determined to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle in person towards <hi>Rome,</hi> and that so much the rather, as he had many other occasions besids of no light importance, mouing him to this long and tedious pilgrimage: Whereof one the most vrgent was this which we shall now tell.</p>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:12171:24"/>
now, <hi>S. Malachy</hi> desired for their greater complement of honour &amp; reputation to obtayne the vse of the sacred Pall: and to the second as more late, the consent also of Apostolicall approbation. And to this effect, he went about to prepare for his iourney. But as the same came to be knowne abroad, not only his domestiques, but al others likewise were infinitely sorry thereat: while it seemed to be a very hard matter for them, to remayne so long without him: and fearing withall, in so great and difficult a voyage by Sea and land, some sinister accident, might betyde him.</p>
               <p>Their anxiety was increased the more, by reason of the death of <hi>Christianus</hi> Bishop and Brother of <hi>S. Malachy,</hi> which happened much about those dayes: a Prelate indeed, though second in glory, yet for zeale and sanctity, peraduenture not much inferiour to him. By reason of this fresh and grieuous a losse, came now the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the blessed Father, to be continually more difficult. And they all affirmed with one voyce, they would by no meanes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, their only prop should depart from them; the country in the meane tyme abyding in so manifest danger of a totall ruine, if both such pillars should thence be taken away at one tyme. So as all from the highest to the lowest, with one and the selfe same spirit, ran hastily to him, and hauing in vayne mixed their reasons, coniura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and protestations to moue him; did at last playnely giue him to vnderstand, that when they saw Loue would not preuayle with him, they would detayne him by force: When <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>o, the Seruant of God, with a seuere countenance, threatning them with chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sement from Heauen, endeauoured to pacify them: and yet was it not possisible for him to hinder them, but that for a finall conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, the matter should be remitted to a decision by Lots; and yet notwithstanding all that, so great was the pertinacity of them, as that after the first, &amp; then the second being drawne in fauour of the Bishop; yet they with exclamations and plaints, would needs haue him come to a third Election: when still finding the same to be conformable to the afore passed, and for that they iudged it to be enacted by the supreme <hi>Head,</hi> and <hi>Disposer</hi> of all things, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst their wills they yield to his desire. But before they would let him go, they desired and humbly requested him to ordeyne one to supply the place &amp; Episcopall Seate of his Brother deceased. To which he willingly condescended, and therefore calling into his presence some: three of his Schollers, was much perplexed in mynd

and vncertayne which of them were the most sufficient for such a high and eminent Ministery. And when he had taken a carefull and diligent suruey of them all: <hi>Do thou Edanus</hi> (sayth he, for so was one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> called) <hi>take vpon thee the charge.</hi> But the poore Wretch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused himselfe, in the best manner he could, and powred forth a shower of brinish teares. <hi>Feare not</hi> (replyed he) <hi>since thou hast been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to me by our Lord himselfe, and I haue seene thee already with the ring of the mysticall Espousalls on thy finger.

And being demaunded by some of the Bishops companions, concerning the successe of that pilgrimage of theirs, among other things he answered, they were not al of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> like to returne backe with him into <hi>Ireland</hi> agayne. Wherupon they fell into some suspition of their dying by the way, but their prediction came to be verifyed indeed in another sense. For as much, as in the returne which <hi>S. Malachy</hi> made from <hi>Rome,</hi> as we shall set downe in its place, he left part of them in the Conuent of <hi>Clarauallis.</hi> And so much may suffice of the Prophet <hi>Sicarus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the same Citty of <hi>York</hi> came to the holy Bishop a Noble ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whose name was <hi>William,</hi> being at that tyme Prior of the Canons of <hi>Circham,</hi> and now Monke, and Father of the Monkes, in our house of <hi>Mailros:</hi> who after he had very humbly recommended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to his prayers, did him a noble act of courtesy; which was, that seeing the trayne of the Bishop to be som what great, &amp; his prouisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of horse but slender (for hauing with him besides Seruants &amp; Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arks, some fiue Priests, he had no more then three horses for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al)
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:12171:25"/>
he made him a friendly present of a horse of his: which because he was outward for the saddle, &amp; of a naughty pace, <hi>William</hi> did inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously alleadge for himselfe how sory he was for the defects, and that he would haue more willingly giuen the same, if he had been much better. Whereto <hi>S. Malachy</hi> made answere: And I like him so much the more, as you seeme to depaynt him worse; and turning himselfe to his followers: Make ready (sayd he) this <hi>Beast for me for he is like to proue well inough, and will hold out for along voyage.</hi> And so got vp, &amp; though in the beginning he found him to be rude, &amp; of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard trot; notwithstanding shortly through a meruaylous chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge it appeared he now had a very dexterous Rider on his backe: and for confirmation of whatsoeuer he had prognosticated of him, for nine whole yeares togeather which <hi>S. Malachy</hi> suruiued, he alwayes serued his turne, becoming really a very excellent &amp; prized horse; &amp; for a later empromement, wheras before he had a coate of a darke gray, he beganne to wax white, in such sort, as within a short space there could hardly be seen a whiter beast.</p>
               <p>These and other like Offices of friendship, found <hi>S. Malachy,</hi> in that pilgrimage: and I my selfe likewise had the hap to know such a Man, and to be fed, and enriched with his spirituall Discourses; and he mutually made shew likewise of some contentment taken in me a Sinner, and loued me deerely, euen to the end of his life.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:12171:27"/>
at that tyme, they vsed much importunity to retayne <hi>S. Malachy</hi> their Ghest with them, to make much of him; so while he liued, they alwayes striued to honour him, and to shew themselues, not to be vnmyndfull, and very gratefull for such a benefit, and therefore offered to him many rich Presents.</p>
               <p>But the wise Contemner of transitory Rewards, and worldly pompe, by any meanes, on the next Morning would needs depart from thence; and passing by the way of <hi>Crugeldus,</hi> restored speach to a certaine young Girle.</p>
               <p>And in the Iland of <hi>S. Michael,</hi> he cured, in the presence of all the people, a woman so possessed with Deuils, as her friends were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to hold her very streightly bound with cords, &amp; sometymes in chaynes of Iron.</p>
               <p>From thence being come to the hauen of <hi>Lapisperius,</hi> while he expected commodity to passe ouer into <hi>Ireland,</hi> he was not ydle, but among other things gaue order, and himselfe likewise put hands to a certayne Oratory of grates or lattuce-worke, &amp; encompassed it round with a fense, leauing in the midst a certayne space for the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryall of the dead; and blessed the same. Which was so efficacious, as that euen to this day, from diuers parts are brought thither many la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing persons, and ill affected, and from thence returne with strength, and wished comfort.</p>
               <p>That same also was very notable, which happened there to a certayne insolent fellow: who being entred into that inuiolable Cemeter, with soule and impious intents to profane the same; he was seized vpon by an vgly and horrible Toade, which suddenly shewing it selfforth, with a swelling looke fell a spitting of venome vpon him. Whereat the poore wretch being sorely astonished and affrighted, threw himselfe ouer the sacred rayles, euen headlong the shortest way.</p>
               <p>But to leaue these degressions, and returne to <hi>S. Malachy;</hi> after he had embarqued himselfe in the said Port, with a good gale, he very happily arriued at the Monastery of <hi>Benchor,</hi> to the end that his first Children, perhaps might likewise be the first, to gayne his Benediction. And who were able sufficiently to expresse the ioy they felt in the reuiew and receiuing of such a <hi>Father,</hi> returned safe and found from parts so remote? Nor the said <hi>Congregation</hi> only, but euen all those people also thereabout, did shew forth such ioy for his returne, that euen from Cittyes, Castles, and Townes they ran

thither in great troupes, to do him Reuerence, &amp; bid him welcome. And he himselfe, not to hold his new <hi>Legation</hi> in vayne, without delay endeauours to visit all those kingdomes, distributing on euery side very holsome gifts of Apostolicall Facultyes, in such sort, as no Sex, nor Age, nor Condition, or Profession whatsoeuer remayned without feeling of some part of the Comfort.</p>
               <p>He celebrated likewise some Nationall Councells, in the more conuenient Cities. Where, for the sound and Catholique Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, were most profitable Canons and Decrees established: carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the meane while, his eyes continually fixed vpon the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sityes of euery one, and applying remedyes all wayes as need requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; now with sweetnes, and now with seuerity. Nor was there heere to be found any one that would seeme to contradict his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, or proudly contemne his admonishments, but they were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accepted of all, as holsome medicines, and as constitutions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued from Heauen. And how could it be otherwise, while al was confirmed by so many workes aboue nature.

               <head>A briefe Description of <hi>S. Malachyes</hi> manner of life, as an introduction to the ensuing miracles, which he wrought. <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.</head>
               <p>IN my iudgment truly, the first, and most stupendious myracle that <hi>S. Malachy</hi> wrought, was <hi>S. Malachy</hi> himselfe. For why; set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting apart the interiour man, whose beauty, worth, and sincerity sufficiently shined most brightly in his life and actions, what shall we say of the exteriour only; which with conformity of manners, to wit, most modest and decent, he would be alwayes shewing in such sort, as not the least thing could euer be discouered therin, that might any wayes seeme to offend the eyes of the beholders? Let vs come to the tongue: It is surely most certayne, that for a man not to trip in talking is a very great perfection. And yet what man, so curious let him be, was euer knowne, that could euer espye, or note in <hi>S. Malachy,</hi> I say not a word, but so much as an ill gesture? Who euer saw him to moue eyther hand or foote with vanity? Nay
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:12171:28"/>
wherin gaue he not Edification to his Neigbhours, in walking in his habit, and semblance? He had so perpetuall a serenity in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, as neyther with the grauity of Melancholy, or leuity of Laughing, was he euer seen to be distempered. All was discipline in him, all harmony, all Vertue. He was an Enemy to scoffs, but yet not austere, or froward. Remisse would he be sometymes, but dissolute neuer. Careles in nothing, though in many he knew wel how to dissemble, till tyme and place. Quiet oftentymes, but yet not once would seeme to be slouthfull.</p>
               <p>From the day of his conuersion, vnto his last breath, he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any thing proper, not seruants, nor farmes, nor messuages, nor finally any manner of rents, eyther Ecclesiasticall or secular. For his Episcopall table, he had no assignement made him at all: yea the good Prelate indeed, had not so much as a determinate dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to put his head in; as he who spent all his life, as it were, in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siting of Villages and Parishes; so seruing the Ghospell, and by the Ghospell therefore susteyning himselfe, according to the order and decree of our <hi>Lord.</hi> It is true, that he and his companions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they would not be burdensome, or put any to expences, would mainteyne themselues oftentymes with the sweat of their browes, and labours of their proper hands. And when at such ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes he had need of some rest, he would vsually be taking it in pious places, dispersed by himselfe heere and there through <hi>Ireland:</hi> and if he chanced to abyde any where, he would allwayes so conforme himselfe to the customes and obseruances of the house, as neyther at Table, or elswhere, would he seeme to haue any thing in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: nor euen at first sight could there any the least difference be discouered betweene him, and the rest of the Brothers.</p>
               <p>What more can be sayd of him? Euen inough to conteyne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Volumes, his life was so admirable, &amp; a mirrour to all Mortals. But my scope and intention is only, to demonstrate those thinges which in his life are most imitable, as I said aboue. To proceed then; although our blessed <hi>S. Malachy,</hi> were now an aged man, and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi> of the <hi>highest Bishop;</hi> yet did he neuer giue ouer his ancient vse to go on foote, to preach himselfe in person, still causing such others as he lead along with him to do the like; a forme very truly Euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and so much the more recommendable in <hi>S. Malachy,</hi> as it is found to be lesse in practice with others. Whereas he, who doth such things, may worthily be called the lawfull heyre, and Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:12171:28"/>
of the Apostles. What wonder is it then, if the diuine Man, did worke such admirable things, he being so admirable himselfe, though he wrought them not of himselfe, but God in him, since we read; <hi>Tu es Deus qui facis mirabilia?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By occasion of the loud acclamations of these his transcendent Vertues, &amp; most notable working of Miracles; his fame beganne to spread it self through out all the neighbouring places, nay euen ouer the whole Country; and there resorted dayly many to be cured by him of all kind of diseases; and among the rest a woman extremely vexed with the deuill, who dwelt in a Citty which is called <hi>Culta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin.</hi> Her parents thereupon procured <hi>S. Malachy</hi> to be sent for: Who comming into the house, presently fell vnto his prayers, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds the vniust possessour in the name of the highest, to go forth of that body; he obeys, but in stantly leapes into another Woman present. <hi>S. Malachy</hi> perceiuing this, spake thus to the accursed Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Making: <hi>I haue not so quit thee of her, as that thou shouldst seeme to assaile that other. Therefore I charge thee agayne in the name of the Highest, that thou let her go also.</hi> The Fiend being constrained thereto, obeyes, his behest, but yet returnes to his former habitation. When the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Seruant of <hi>Christ,</hi> obseruing the deceypt of our Aduersary, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells him a new from thence, he then flyes agayne into the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. This bobb the peruerse spirit gaue to him for a pretty while, in chopping so alwayes, and flying from one into the other. At last <hi>S. Malachy</hi> being stirred vp with a holy zeale, and not without iust indignation, to see him so mocked by all vncleane Spirit, recolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted himselfe a little, and resuming more in tense forces from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, withall violence quite banished him from both: leauing the cruell Serpent (so full of fraude and deceipt) enraged thereat, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king perhaps by that policy to make the <hi>Holy man</hi> desist from further troubling himself. But peraduenture some will admire at this long delay heerein, and resistance of the Aduersary, attributing the same (it may be) to the power of the malignant Spirit. To such persons I answere, that it pleased the Diuine Dispensatour of all things, <hi>Qui omnia ben<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>In <hi>Lesmor</hi> likewise did <hi>S. Malachy</hi> deliuer a Lunatike person; &amp; made him whole and perfect in all his senses.

Another woman in like sort being enraged, so as she would be a biting, &amp; tearing her flesh with her teeth, was by him through Prayer, &amp; a simple touch only restored to health.

I could name the place where this fel out; but because it happened in a place of so barbarous a name, that (as it happens often in many other words of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) it may scarce seeme fit to be expressed with the voyce much lesse represented with the pen, I thinke it a thing very conuenient, to let it passe namelesse.</p>
               <p>There was in the aforesayd Citty of <hi>Lesmor,</hi> a certayne young girle very dumbe, whome her Parents hauing humbly put in the presence of <hi>S.

In the Citty of <hi>Cassel,</hi> came one to <hi>S. Malachy,</hi> with a sonne of his, being sick of the palsey crauing pitty at his hands. The holy Bishop the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> litting vp his mynd to our Lord, said to the Father of that child: <hi>Goe thy wayes, for thy so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne shall recouer.</hi> He went then, but returned the next Morning, with the child not yet cured. <hi>S. Malachy</hi> making his prayer for the Child some what longer then before, cheered him vp, and gaue strict or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Father of the lame child, to dedicate him to the diuine Seruice, which he faithfully promised to do. But yet afterwards kept not his word. Wherupon the youth after some yeares relapsed agayne into the same palsey.</p>
               <p>Another Man likewise brought his sonne to the holy Man, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> parts farre distant. This child had withered feete, and was not able to moue a whit. <hi>S. Malachy</hi> demaunded how the same happened. I thinke (answered the Man) it was the worke of the Deuill, because my sonne, being, on a tyme, childishy disporting himselfe in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne meadow, that accursed Fiend (if I be not deceiued) made him to fall a sleepe, &amp; then awaking, I know not how, he was fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d taken in this manner. And speaking thes words, he powred forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of teares, and humbly prayed the Diuine Man, to giue his sonne some succour. Who being mollifyed therwith (according to his custome) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded the lame child, to giue himself to sleepe while he prayed; who did as much: and when <hi>S. Malachy</hi> had ended his prayer, the child immediately stood vpon his feete, very iocund and lusty. The holy man kept him afterwards with him, a prety while, and iustructed him well in the Rudiments of the Christian Fayth, carrying him along with him, into diuers places with his other Domestiques.</p>
               <p>A certaine poore Man, serued in a Mill of the Monastery of <hi>Benchor,</hi> maynteyning himselfe partly with that labour, partly also with dayly almes. This man had likewise been lame now for these twelue yeares, in such sort, as he was compelled to go with his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds on the ground, and trayling his dead feete after him. Now <hi>S. Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> beholding him one day before his Cell, to be somewhat sadder then ordinary; with the bowels of Charity, demaunded of him, the <hi>reason why he was so pensiue?</hi> The disconsolate man answered: <hi>You see,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:12171:31"/>
alas, how long now it is, that I miserable Caytiuehaue suffered this same: and how the hand of God seemes verily to oppresse me, and for a greater increase therof how I receiue dayly nothing but scornes and reproaches of such, as should rather compassionate my Case.</hi> The benigne Father, being wholy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with these words, with eyes and hands lifted vp towards the Mercy-Seate of <hi>God</hi> made his prayer to that Soueraigne <hi>Iudge;</hi> &amp; to the end they should be more efficacious, he retires himselfe into his Cel, where falling prostrate on the ground, he most hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bly beseeched the diuine Mercy, to restore that poore creature to his formen stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth. His prayer was quickly heard. For the Man arising from the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, stood vp firme on his feete. This thing seemed to him a Dreame, for he did nothing but looke about him, to see whether it were true or no. And yet neuerthelesse making some proofe to moue his Legs, &amp; to frame his Steps, he at last acknowledged the diuine Mercy to be shewed vpon him: and then nimbly returned home to the Mill, with much ioy, and with infinite rendring of thankes to <hi>God.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon his Companions, and the others who knew right well who he was, remayned astonished, and amazed, as it were, at the sight of some phantasme; attributing the same to the Goodnes of God, and the Sanctity of their blessed <hi>Bishop.</hi>

               <p>In the same place, was a Man cured of the dropsy, through the only Intercession of <hi>S. Malachy.</hi> Who afterwards remayned in the seruice of the Monastery.</p>
               <p>There was a certayne Gentlewoman of parentage very well descended, but yet farre more illustrious for her vertue, which made her most deere to the blessed <hi>Pastour.</hi> This woman, was grieuously afflicted with the bloudy flux; &amp; this her disease was so vehement, as she, in processe of tyme, was brought to an extreme debility, &amp; euen, through the aboundant issuing of bloud, was ready to giue and yeild vp her spotlesse Soule into the hands of her mercifull <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</hi> Her friends seeing her in this lamentable case, sent a messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with all speede to <hi>S.

When the holy <hi>Bishop</hi> heard this heauy Newes, he was strooke very sad, for the losse he saw would ensue of a Matron of that great worth and rare Example, as she was of. And sudenly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to go his wayes thither: but afterwards fearing to arriue too late, called to him <hi>Malcus</hi> a man of a singular integrity of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, (of whome we made mention before) and a very dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, taking one of the apples, with a trembling hand she beganne to bite the same, and being newly reuiued with the only tast ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, brake forth into words and prayses of God. By &amp; by her sleepe, which together with her tast had now for a good while been lost, returned to her agayne, and she reposing with great sweetnes, the bloud in the meane tyme came to make a stop. In so much as being now a wake without more ado, she found her selfe to be altogeather whole although not without some ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of weakenes, the which notwithstanding by the next day did likewise leaue her, at the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected presence of <hi>S.

The good Father (very loath) yeilds thereunto, and making the signe of the Crosse vpon the sick woman, retyred himself into the other Chambers. He had not been there long, but behold you might easily haue heard, some pittyfull cryes, plaints, and noyses founding through all the howse, that their <hi>Mistries was dead.</hi> The blessed man of God hearing this tumult, runs with his disciples, and approaching to the bed, certainely found she had giuen vp her last breath. Whereat he was full of sorrow &amp; heauynes, laying the fault on himselfe, for that she had so departed
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:12171:32"/>
without that <hi>Sacrament;</hi> and then lifting vp his hands to heauen, with great affect. <hi>Lord</hi> (said he) <hi>I cry thee mercy for I haue playd the foole, and been too negligent heerein. It is I, euen I, that haue sinned, with this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longation, &amp; not this poore wretch, who for her part had a very good wil therunto.</hi> After he had thus exclaymed, he vowed to take no more Comfort or repose of any sort, till he had rendred to the dead, what he had wrongfully taken from her: and so standing with his face ouer the corps, endeauours to warme and foment those frozen limmes with bitter teares, and burning sighs, supplying to his power, the passed want: and turning towards his Company, from tyme to tyme, would besaying to them: <hi>Watch, and pray,</hi> So as they with Psalter, and deuout prayers, he with deepe Sighes, passed away the whole night, without a winke of sleep; when as lo the Morning came, it pleased the <hi>Diuine Clemency,</hi> to listen vnto the vnspeakeable sighes of his most faythfull Seruant. What more? She opens her eyes, who was dead before: She sits vp right, and knowing <hi>S. Malachy,</hi> with a deuoute bow, saluted him. Whereat as many as beheld the sight, &amp; heard so meruaylous things, were exceedingly amazed; and all the sadnes turned into ioy. Yet <hi>S. Malachy,</hi> (though there appeared no more danger for the present) very piously would needes annoynt the reuiued, as knowing well, how assuredly in that Mistery sinnes are remitted, and how likewise the body feeles a help. After he had finished this good act, he departed from thence. As for her, she (to the greater glory of God) suruined for some tyme in good health: &amp; hauing performed the Penance imposed her by <hi>S. Malachy,</hi> sell sicke afterwards agayne, &amp; with the wonted succours of the holy <hi>Church,</hi> very happily dyed.</p>
               <p>There was moreouer a Woman so afflicted with the spirit of anger and fury, as not only her kinsfolkes and neighbours seemed to shun her conuersation; but euen her owne children could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endure to inhabite with her. Wheresoeuer she was, there was nothing but scolding, rancour, and a hideous storme, bold, fyery, audacious, gibing, light of fingers, vntollerable, and fastidious to euery one. By reason whereof, her afflicted Children not finding other way of redresse, from so continuall and bitter grieuances, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued to bring her (as dexterously they did) into the presence of <hi>S.

Which the furious woman did through diuine instinct: and he hauing enioyned her a conuenient pennance, &amp; prayed a while ouer her, commaunded her on the behalfe of <hi>Christ</hi> our <hi>Lord,</hi> that from thence forth, <hi>she should be angry no more.</hi> A thing incredible: there suddenly grew such a meeknes, and so great a patience in her, that euery one might know, there could be nothing therein, but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a change from Heauen. Which was so great a comfort to her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as cannot be expressed. She is yet lyuing, and is sayd to be of so fayre a condition, &amp; of so deep a Tranquility, as where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she was wont to exasperate and offend euery one; she is now not troubled a whit withall the losses, iniuries, or tribulations that can befall her.</p>
               <p>Now let euery one, esteeme of things as he please. If with the <hi>Apostle</hi> it may be lawfull for me, to abound in my sense, I dare say, that greater was the exploit of this amendement, then was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling of the Gentlewoman spoken aboue from death to life: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in the former was the exteriour Man raysed, in the later, only the interiour.

               <p>A secular man of good quality, came to condole with <hi>S.

And being so washed and cleansed from those spots of Capitall sinnes, his innocent Soule ascended on high to him, <hi>Qui in altis habitat,</hi> there to giue him laudes and prayses, and continually to sing the celestiall Song of <hi>Alleluia.</hi>

               <p>SAINT <hi>Malachy</hi> in trauayling (as we haue sayd) to preach the word of God, did many Miracles, whereof this is one.

Malachy</hi> resided in the Conue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of <hi>Benchor,</hi> those people happened to be in a great difference; to compose which, on all sides they accorded to stand to the arbitrement of <hi>S. Malachy</hi> the true Seruant of <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi> But he was at that tyme very much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with many cares, which was the reason he gaue the charge to decide that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersy to another Bishop. But he also excused him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, saying, that <hi>S. Malachy, and not he, was required for the effect.</hi> And therfore he desired to be quitted of that toyle, for that they would contemne him, &amp; he take paynes to no purpose. <hi>Go your wayes</hi> (sayth he) <hi>and our Lord shall be with you.</hi> And the other Bishop replyed: <hi>I am content to vndertake the charge, but if they listen not to me, then know for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne that I will send for you to determine this debate, which is rysen amongst them.</hi> At which words, <hi>S. Malachy</hi> smiling: Do so then, answered he. Wherupon the Bishop condescended to vndertake the taske, and so departed.</p>
               <p>Within a short tyme after, this Bishop caused the partyes to be assembled together. The cause was throughly debated on both sides: and for that tyme they were attoned, in such sort as they came to the signing of some articles of agreement betweene them, agreed vpon with full Consent on all sides: and theerupon they went home to their owne howses. But scarce were they gone on the way, when one of the Company being tempted by the accursed enemy of Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, raysed a sedition betweene them, hauing a fayre opportunity offered him. For the other was turning homwards carelesse on the way, supposing they were now out of all daunger, and therefore were naked, I meane, without any manner of defensiue or offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue weapons about them. Wherupon that wicked Company wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we first spake, began to say among themselues: <hi>What do we stand vpon? We haue already the victory in our hands, and we may now worke our owne reuenge.</hi> With this fatall resolution they furiously turning back, made hast to ouertake them on the suddayne, and vnawares. Which the <hi>Bishop</hi> perceiuing hyed him to the Captayne of that Rout, or assembly, and began to complayne for so great an iniustice, and for so open and vntolerable a treason; but his complaynt auayling little, he addes protestations, he alleadgeth the respect and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of him that sent him thither, he menaceth the wrath of God, &amp; in fine vsed all possible meanes to diuert him from so great a perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes.

But the barbarous man, after he had let him a while con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iure &amp; cry, at last turning himselfe to him with a proud countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: <hi>Do you think</hi> (answered he) <hi>that for your sake we should let the malefactours get out of our Clawes, whome God as a prey, hath so deliuered to vs?</hi> Then the poore Bishop remembring himselfe of the admonishment giuen at his departure, stretching his eyes and armes towards the Monastery began vehemently to weepe &amp; exclayme: <hi>O man of God, where are you now?

At which rumour, though vayne, their boldnes immediately being repressed, euery one betooke him to his heeles, leauing the rest to shift for themselues: and as it chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in like tumults, the confusion was so great, as the hind most not hauing once heard the said voyce, nor knowing wherefore, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Malachy,</hi> they had through diuine Iudgment, been giuen into the power of the Spirit of Lying. Wherat the Bishop reioycing, he spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily returned back to carry the newes to <hi>S.

For now to them it seemed to be more then the wonted brooke, yea a very huge water, which on euery side denyed them passage; in so much as being al in admiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they said: <hi>Whence comes this inundation? the weather is fayre, the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taines without snow, there hath fallen no rayne of late; and though it should chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to haue rayned, yet which of vs can remember this little torrent, with any wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters euer to haue been swolne in this sort, as to come thus to couer the land, and to ouer flow the champaines?

withall at so iust a quarrell, what he intends to do in this case, we will declare. Hauing so sure a foundation, as the past promise of the King, he quickly reares vp a strong Bull warke agaynst ensuing assaults, and endeauours withall power to suppresse this enormous treason; to effect which, he musters vp a braue army, to wit, a good company of his disciples, and with them presenting himselfe before the king, demaunds the prisoner at his hands: and being shamefully denyed. <hi>You wrong</hi> (saith he) <hi>at once the diuine Maiesty, your selfe, &amp; me, in violating the pact. And if you haue no care therof; yet haue I truly. This good man was perswaded by me; he founded himself vpon my word.

Then know for certayne, that neyther I, nor these of myne, are resolued to tast any food, vntill such tyme, as the innocent, be put into liberty, as be ought.</hi> That sayd, he entred with them into the Temple, where all that day, with the next night, they perseuered together in Fasting and Prayer. But the King who dwelt hard by, fearing least their prayers, he being so neere, might seeme to haue too much force vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him, with a foolish caution and aduise, tooke the resolution to absent himselfe from thence. But he no sooner was departed, but God, who reserues reuenge vnto himselfe, stroke him blind, and hauing lost wholy his sight, was glad to restore the prisoner; and to be as an other <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>Ananias,</hi> so he to the holy Bishop, being led vnto him, where humbly crauing pardon, and mercy, through the benigne &amp; feruent intercession of him, that could not be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of iniuries, with a double miracle he had presently his sight. And in fine, the Gentleman being deliuered, an inuiolable friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship was accorded on. This surely was a great demonstration of the diuine Iudgement; but perhaps, this other, which (God assisting vs) we intend to declare, will by the wise arbitratours, be held no lesse.</p>
               <p>We haue related aboue, that <hi>S. Malachy</hi> accepting the Abbay of <hi>Benchor,</hi> being content with the Church, and Seate, had volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily yielded the rents and demeanes to a certayne lay man. This ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> paying as commonly is wont so great a benefit with great discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesy and ingratitude, from the tyme he entred into the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those goods, beganne to vse many insolencies agaynst the holy <hi>Abbot</hi> and agaynst his <hi>Religious;</hi> annoying them in euery thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> persecuting them on euery side, and endeauouring alwayes to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify,

and denigrate their actions and deportments; but he escaped not free for so great iniustice. He had an only sonne, who through the example of the wicked Father being likewise bent to molest &amp; offend the Man of God, within the terme of a yeare onely, made a miserable End. The matter succeeded in this sort.</p>
               <p>It seemed good to <hi>S. Malachy,</hi> for the increase of diuine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, to build an Oratory of stone worke, as he had seene done in other countryes, and the foundations now being layd, those bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous people, fell a wondering thereat, as at a thing very vnu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall with them. But that malicious and proud yong man aboue the rest, of whome we spake, shewed not only with the others an admiration thereof, but such rancour withall, as he could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne himselfe from murmuring heere and there agaynst the same: and after he had with diuers instigations and calumnies endeauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to stirre vp those people agaynst the Seruant of <hi>Christ;</hi> at last comming with a shole of Townsmen, vpon the heate of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines, and with a scornefull eye, beholding <hi>S.

                  </gap>brayne and rash man came to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his wicked intention: without once reflecting on his small for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Forasmuch as his followers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in whome he confided so much, as soone as they came in sight of the venerable Bishop, being sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chaunged in hart, returned home to their houses; that impious, seditious and wretched Leader being quite aboandoned, as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued. To whome with Fortitude and Meroy withall, the man of God, answered: <hi>Thou miserable wretch, this worke which thou heere seest begunne, and beholdest with an ill countenance; shall be finished without doubt, and many shall see it accomplished. But thou, because thou hast no will thereunto. shalt neuer see it: And looke you to it, least Death surprize you not in your sinne.</hi> So <hi>S. Malachy</hi> sayd, &amp; so fell it out. He dyed, and the worke was finished: but he saw it not, because, as we sayd; he dyed the very same yeare.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:12171:37"/>
Now the Father of that wicked wretch, hauing known of the <hi>Saints</hi> prediction, he hath kild (sayth he) my sonne, and was so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed agaynst him for it, as in the presence of the Captayne and of the Chiefe of the Country there, he had no respect to him a whit, but called him Enuious, hollow-harted, and a meere Cosener; and lastly for a greater spight, termed him a Moncky. To which bitter contumelies, the follower of Christ answered not a word: But yet the great God would not seeme to hold his peace, throgh whose will, on that very day, that impious wretch, being seized on by an infernall spirit, and cast into the fire, was by his friends very hardly taken forth from thence, with his lymmes all burnt, with his wits crackt, with his face awry &amp; foaming as the mouth; sending forth such horrible cryes, &amp; framing such strange gestuures of the body, as put a terrour into euery one, and many togeather had much a do to hold him. Heerupon <hi>Saint Malachy</hi> was called to the spectacle, and with wonted clemency making his prayer for him, was heard, but not to the full; Because that in chastisement and memory of the offence committed agaynst the holy Father; he had after that, euen to this day, certayne grieuous fits, which at changes of the Mooue, doe most bitterly afflict him.</p>

them vp, but exposing them indeed; ordeyning so large a donary of the Creatour, should wholy without sparing a whit be spent in the seruice of the Creatour: and so much the rather, as by a passed Reuelation, he knew that Edifice to be acceptable to his diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty.

               <p>NOw at last, let vs heere make a stop to the signes and prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyes from the diuine arme, shewed forth in fauour of <hi>S. Malachy</hi> by an entire catalogue therof. It sufficeth that noting the same with some diligence, which we haue already touched, the Iudicious wil assuredly acknowledge all the species, at least of the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t myracles; as Prophesies, Reuelations, Chasticements of the wicked, Healths of body, Conuersions of mynds, Resurrection of the Dead. Besides which, through his so excellent vertues, he was magnifyed of our Lord likewise in the sight of Kings, and the greatest Men: he was full of merits, and after many and grieuous persecutions, surmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at last, euen Enuy it selfe. From so honorable a Race, what might be expected heere, but a glorious yssue? Let vs now see then in what manner he went forth.</p>
               <p>On a day <hi>S. Malachy,</hi> and the Brethren togeather were in a holy recreation, conferring amongst themselues of the last passage: and euery one being inuited by turnes, discouered where, &amp; when it would like him best to depose his terrene carkas, while some insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating one, and some another solemnity; some this, some that Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter or Churchyard; <hi>S. Malachy</hi> (when it came to his turne to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere) standing first a litle in suspense, for the place distinguished: That if he were to remayne in <hi>Ireland,</hi> it would be most gratefull to him, to be where he might arise in the company of the holy Apostle <hi>S. Patricke:</hi> &amp; if in forraine parts, no where more willingly would he repose his bones, then in the church of <hi>Clareuallis.</hi> As for the tyme he chose the day of All-soules: to the end to be accompanyed then with greatest number of suffrages, that might be. Now if this were <hi>S. Malachyes</hi> desire, he had the fauour afforded; If an Oracle, it missed not a iot, as we shall see.</p>
               <p>The feruent desire, which <hi>S. Malachy</hi> euer had to adorne the two Metropolitans with the sacred Palls, was not a whit extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, though for a tyme buryed in the ashes of obliuion. Which now he vnraked, and was wholy enflamed with a desire to put it in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent execution. Which to performe effectually, after he had recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended himselfe to our Lord, he gathered a generall Synod in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> and after the dispatch of other particulars, came to the foresayd
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:12171:39"/>
point of the Palls. The proposition pleased all for the most; but with condition, that the enterprize should be committed to some other, besides him. Yet notwithstanding <hi>S. Malachy</hi> made great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to go, in regard Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> was dead, &amp; <hi>Eugenius,</hi> a Monke of <hi>Clareuallis,</hi> was mutually chosen for his Successour: yet had he no cause to feare a repulse, in renewing of his memorial; for he was a Man of that benignity and sanctimony, as the fame therof spread it selfe throughout the world: and likewise in respect, <hi>Pope Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> for publique affayres, was then resident in <hi>France,</hi> which was a short way, and lesse daungerous, then the first he vndertooke. The Prelates perceiuing the great desire he had to vndergoe that paynefull iourney, durst not much oppose themselues agaynst the will of the holy man, but consented to his desire: Which he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke as soone as the Councell was dissolued.</p>
               <p>Amongst a great number of his friends, which accompanyed him to the Sea syde, one was called by name <hi>Catholicus,</hi> who was sorely molested with an Epilepsy; in such sort as often tymes in a day he would fall on the ground, to the exceeding great brusing of his whole body, which to preuent he had alwayes one to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend vpon him. This miserable wretch turning himselfe to <hi>S. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachy,</hi> with a lamentable voyce, and full of teares, sayd. <hi>Ay me, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you go now your wayes, and know in how great, and how many afflictions you leaue me, and yet can you help it, if you please: and though I for my sinnes, haue, and do deserue all euill, yet alas, what fault haue these poore Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers done, to whome for my sake is not permitted an houre of rest?</hi> with this plaint the hart of the Blessed Bishop was as it were, now spilt asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: When he deerly imbracing the sick man, made the signe of the Crosse on his breast, saying: <hi>Rest secure yet, and be confident that you shall not fall into the like fit agayne, till my returne.</hi> That malady the poore man had susteyned for six yeares togeather. But now at the only speach of <hi>S. Malachy,</hi> he was recouered in such sort, as he neuer fell more thereinto, being in a moment deliuered from so grieuous, &amp; bitter a payne, and the assistants themselues from a long and yrk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some a custody.</p>
               <p>After which, as <hi>S. Malachy</hi> was taking ship, came two of his most inward friends to him, for to craue a notable boone at his hands; and he demanding what their request was: we will not tell you, sayd they, till you promise vs first to comfort vs: he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed so to do; then they replyed. We will (sayd they) that you faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:12171:39"/>
promise vs another thing, which is to make your returne to <hi>Ireland</hi> agayne, very safe and sound: the very same did all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers beseech him. Whereupon the seruant of <hi>Christ,</hi> retiring a litle, as he was wont, within himselfe; and being sorry first for hauing so engaged his word, not knowing how to discharge himselfe, being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Then though with an euill will he answered, yea: and his disciples being comforted not a litle heerwith, he caused them to hoyse vp sayle. But in the midst of the Sea, he was driuen backe agayne vpon the cost of <hi>Ireland,</hi> by a sudden contrary wind. Where he landed, and passed the night in a Church of his, acknowledging and thanking the diuine goodnes, for that without the preiudice of any, he had by that meanes acquit him from all wherein he was bound to his Monkes. And in the morning being afresh embarqued, he landed very happily on the same day in the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> &amp; after two dayes more arriued at <hi>Verdestagnus,</hi> where leauing certayne sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects for a Cistercian Abbay which he had founded there, he pursued his iourney, and being honorably receiued by King <hi>Dauid,</hi> in the confines there, staying in that place for some dayes, not without a great deale of fruite, he passed into <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>SAINT Malachy</hi> at his entrance into the kingdome of England lodged in the Canonry of <hi>Gisburne:</hi> where he contracted a very streight friendship with those Priests there of singular fame.

               <p>Departing from thence, he went to the Sea side, where he met withan vnlookt for impediment, caused through certayne differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces risen at that tyme betweene the Apostolique Sea, and the King of England about iurisdiction; which were then growne so hoat, as he through abounda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t iealousy permitted no Prelate to go forth of the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:12171:40"/>
Iland; and for the same respect, was the Bishop <hi>Malachy</hi> likewise reteyned for some tyme. Who on the one syde though he were sory to be delayed in that sort from his businesses: yet was he not aware on the other syde, that this very delay seemed to fauour his vowes, &amp; designes. Because, if he had presently gon into <hi>Fraunce,</hi> he had been feigne, leauing <hi>Clareuallis,</hi> and passing the Alps, with diligence to haue measured the greater part of <hi>Italy;</hi> the Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> being alre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ady gone forth of France, &amp; approached to <hi>Rome.</hi> Where as now by this delay through a sea-passage, his iourney by diuine prouiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce came to be disposed in that manner as he arriued at <hi>Clareuallis,</hi> euen at the point himselfe desired. Where being receiued by vs, as an Angell descended from Paradise; what a light seemed to shine vpon this our habitation, and what a solemne Feast was it for vs al? and I my selfe now trembling, and weake as I was, being reuiued with the newes, ran full of exultation and iubiley to his holy kisses and imbraces; and he reciprocally, shewed himselfe to vs, as he was wont, very pleasant and affable, and wonderfully gratefull to euery one.</p>
               <p>Now by this tyme were some foure or fiue dayes of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon gladnes passed ouer, when behold on the Feast of the glorious <hi>S. Luke</hi> the Euangelist, after he had with extraordinary deuotion ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Masse in publique, he was taken with a feuer. Wherupon falling downe on his bed, he fell sick, and all our ioy was turned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So as recouering hope, you might haue seene, what running there was vp and downe in the howse, some to prouide medicins, some to apply some<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tations, some to bring him meate, some to exhort and intreate him to eate, euery one striuing to serue such a Ghest, and accompting themselues most happy that could haue most accesse to that holy &amp; blessed man Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>S. Malachy</hi> beholding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with a benigne countenance: <hi>All these paynes</hi> (would he say) <hi>are too much for you to take: but yet for your sakes I refuse them not, and willingly do what you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund me.</hi> He knew right well his latest hower approched: and to his companions, who would seeme to comfort him with saying there appeared in him no mortall signe, <hi>It is conuenient</hi> (would he answere) <hi>by all meanes that</hi> Malachy <hi>this yeare depart this life. The day approches now, which I, as you very well know, haue alwayes wished to be the last of my short dayes. I know well in whome I trust: and now that I haue part of my intent, I am certaine, and secure in like
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:12171:40"/>
sort that my desire shalbe graunted in the rest. He that brought me through his clemency to this place I desired so much; will not deny me the tyme nor terme: and for as much as concernes this weary body of myne, I will heere repose it: for the soule he shall prouide for it, who giues saluation to such as put their trust in him: Nor haue I any small confidence in the same dya, wherin by the lyuing is purchased so great a help to the dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now approached full neere the day indeed, when he spake so freely of it: so as not to loose any tyme, he craued for the <hi>Extreme vnction.</hi> And while the Monks were about to descend into the <hi>Church</hi> to fetch the holy Oyle with procession thence vnto his chamber, he would not seeme to consent thereunto by any meanes: but would in person be led downe thither, where with the greatest veneration that might be, hauing taken the holy Oyle, as also the heauenly <hi>Viatique,</hi> he returned to his bed, and recommended himselfe to the prayers of the Brethren, as he likewise mutually recommended the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to our Lord. And it is a meruaylous thing, how from an vpper cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that was somewhat high, wherin he was lodged, he came forth and descended on his feete, while he affirmed not withstanding, that death had knocked at the doore. And yet, who would belieue it? He was not pale in the face, nor meagre, nor wrinckled in the brow, nor had his eyes funck, nor his nose sharpe, nor his lips co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, nor black his teeth, nor leane &amp; slender his neck, nor cru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt in the shoulders, nor finally had he the flesh of the whole body any whit fallen away. Thus far hath my pen gon on its course; now it seemes, as it were, to runne a ground, and loath to passe to that which by all meanes is conuenient to be written, as immediately followes.</p>

The sacred Offices being ended, as well as they could be, <hi>S.

               <p>And now hope being quite lost on all sides, and ech one resu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his owne prognosticat, and acknowledging those of the sicke to be likewise true; we were called on his behalfe to the Cel where he lay, &amp; he casting his eyes towards vs: <hi>With a great desire</hi> (sayd he) <hi>haue I desired to make this present Pascha with your Charities: Thanks be to the supernal piety, that I see not my self defrauded of my hope. If I be able I shall not be vnmindfull of you. Go to, I shall. I haue put my trust in God, and euery thing is possible to the belieuer. I haue loued God, I haue loued you: Loue is without terme.</hi> Hereupon looking vp to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he adds, <hi>O Lord conserue these in thy name, and not these only, but all those who by meanes of thy word, and my ministery, haue beene dedicated to thy holy seruice.</hi> After which imposing hands vpon all, one by one, he makes vs to go rest our selues: alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the extremest article was not yet arriued. We went our wayes then, and about midnight, being newly awaked, we ran to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, who was now vpon departure.

And so with psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, hymnes, and spirituall Canticles accompanyed we our friend in his way homwards.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>S.

And may be said to sleepe; Since we all hauing our eyes fixed vpon that venerable face of his, were none of vs aware of his last breath; there not appearing in the dead the least signe to distinguish him a whit from what he was liuing. And such was the freshnes of that whole angelicall countenance of his, as he might seeme to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued rather an ornamet from death, then any iniury at all.

docible, acute, and constant. Besides he was bred of Christian pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, very honourable, with singular care and custody, and with so much the greater facility, as the Child of his owne accord, being much aliened from childish sports, and profane studies, shewed him selfe most amorous of silence, and of Churches; attentiue to the word of God, content with simple fare, and without any delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. To such matters, and addresses as these, the holy Ghost added the forme, and the ornaments, which presently we shall see. For that indeed in the most dangerous passage of his age, which was of 18. or 20. being left an Orpha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with one Sister only, certaine things began to come into his mynd, which formerly he had heard, or read, of the Counsayles of Christ, of the conuersation of his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and of the meruailous feruour of the primitiue Church, at such tyme as the faythfull, replenished with charity, selling their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and liuings, and whatsoeuer els they possessed in the world, went voluntarily, bringing the price thereof, and laying the same at the feete of the <hi>Apostles.</hi> Considering withall, the inestimable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, wherewith for the same they were to be recompenced in <hi>Heauen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These thoughts, went <hi>S. Antony</hi> reuoluing in his mind; when as it happened through diuine disposition, being entred into a Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, according to custome, he heard in the very same instant, these words of the Ghospell recited; <hi>Si vis perfectus esse, vade, &amp; vende om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia quaecumque habes, &amp; da pauperibus, &amp; veni sequere me, &amp; habebis the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saurum in caelo.</hi> The words were not sung to a deafe man: they sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly pierced with extraordinary feeling vnto the marrow &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> without delay: and gaue liberally the rents of his Patrimony to his kindred, which were 300. acres of very fertill land, as <hi>S. Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For the moueables he put them to sale, and taking from thence a summe of money, distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted the same to the poore; reseruing to himselfe, but a very small part for necessities occurring, and especially for his Sisters sake. But within litle after, being returned to the Church, and hearing that other aduise of the chiefe <hi>Verity; Nolite cogitare de crastino:</hi> with a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous resolution he made an end of selling the rest, and placing the child his Sister, in the company of some noble and deuout Virgins,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:12171:44"/>
he distributed the rest that remayned, to the poore. Thence lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his house, and parents, being replenished with singular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, he made his entry into the sharpe way of perfect Vertue.</p>
               <p>At that tyme, there were not on foote so many Monasteryes in <hi>Egipt,</hi> as were afterwards to be seene: and in the Deserts which were more remote (none can remember) that euer any one inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, till that tyme: But, he that would with particular study, giue himselfe to diuine Seruice, and attend to the saluation of his soule, for the most, recollected himselfe into some little Lodging, neare to his country, and there would exercise and apply himselfe with sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry meanes to pacify the heauenly wrath, to amend his manners, &amp; to prepare himselfe for death. The holy youth hauing got some no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of one of these Exe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>citants, being now of good yeares, and wel experienced, disposed himselfe to do as much. And likewise seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string himselfe from the conuersation of seculars, began first to deale with him, and afterwards with others, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time to tyme, such as dayly he discouered to be addicted to that manner of life: and not for curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity to know sundry inclinations of natures, or features of faces, but with diligence only to obserue the industryes, and vertuous quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes of all, and in ech one to imitate whatsoeuer might seeme more admirable in him; and so like a wise Bee, for the framing of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall hony, in visiting them at tymes, and shewing himselfe offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, obsequious, and obedient to them, he went on with a great deale of iudgment; collecting abstinence from hence, thence affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, from one dexterity in conuersation, from another vigilancy in praying, from this heere patience and meekenes, from him there sharpe penance and mortification, and from all together a feare of God, and christian charity to his Neighbour. And it is truly a thing worthy of note, that he contending so with euery one to his power in so noble an enterprize, would be doing the same with such cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection, and with so much sweetnes; as not only he was free from rancour and enuy, but likewise highly beloued and esteemed of euery one. And moreouer now hauing made the renunciation of his goods, and hauing nothing to susteyne himselfe, he would not liue with the sweat of other mens browes, but would giue some tyme to the labour of his hands, &amp; of the price which he purchased with his trauells, reteyning onely to himselfe, so much as might suffice him for a little bread, he would diuide the rest with very great charity, among the poore.</p>

               <p>TO so fayre a beginning, and so happy a progresse, the subtile &amp; cruell Enemy of human kind, opposeth himselfe, vsing all art, and framing euery engin, to withdraw the new souldiour from his glorious purposes. First he beginnes on the one side, to reduce into his mynd, his parentall inheritance, the commodity and delights of his home; his nobility of bloud, with the hope of new purposes. On the other, the streight way of vertue, the frailty of flesh, the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of pennances, especially in the spatiousnes of a long life, which with apparent reasons, he would seeme to make him promise to himselfe. He added moreouer, the due sollicitude of his kindred, &amp; particularly of the virgin his Sister; who though recommended to others, yet if peraduenture any sad disastre should betide her, she might iustly in the sight of God &amp; men, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine of him. With these suggestions, gaue Sathan the first assaults to <hi>S. Antony:</hi> and perceiuing himselfe to be so valiantly repelled with words of the diuine scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, through liuely fayth, and with the memory of the Pouerty, of the dolours, and Passion of <hi>Christ;</hi> he reenforced the battayle afresh, with a squadron of bestiall &amp; carnall thoughts, enflaming in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, the naturall incentiues of youthfull age, and representing in his imagination day and night, sundry formes of beautifull and lasciuious women. This new warre, as it was continuall and peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to <hi>S. Antony,</hi> so was it grieuous and troublesome to him beyond measure, and the Enemyes so much the more audacious and fierce, as their intelligence on earth was greater, and their enflamed darts seemed to penetrate more neere to the Fort of the soule.</p>
               <p>Neuertheles, the stout and faythfull Guardian, opposed so many rampiers of vigils, fastings, considerations of infernal paynes and of the last iudgment; and aboue all obteyned with humble and feruent prayer so much succour from heauen, as euen likewise from these battayles, he seemed to carry away alwayes a happy &amp; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious victory. Whereupon the restles Aduersary did te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt him with arrogancy, and vanity, hoping by that meanes to depriue him of the crowne. Within a little after, the Enuious &amp; diabolicall wretch appeared to the blessed young man, in the shape of a horrid, &amp; yong Blackamore, complayning with a human voyce, &amp; prostrate at his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:12171:45"/>
feete, sayd to him: Many, and many, <hi>O Antony,</hi> haue I deceiued in my tyme, but as by other <hi>Saints,</hi> so likewise now by thee, and thy valour, am I put to confusion. Being demanded, who he was: I am said he, the frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of Carnality. I am he that moues debates, &amp; in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry manners, do cause perplexities in youth; &amp; therfore they do call me, the spirit of Fornication. How many, that haue beene disposed to liue in Chastity, haue I made them already to alter their purposes? How many, that haue begun to keepe the same, haue I reduced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne to their obscenes and vncleanes, as before? I am he, through whose occasion, the <hi>Prophet</hi> so reprehends the lapsed, saying: <hi>Spirit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> fornicationis seducti estis:</hi> &amp; surely with reason too, since I, &amp; no other but I, am he that deceiued them. And I finally, am he, who haue tempted thee often, yet hitherto could I neuer ensnare thee.</p>
               <p>At these words, <hi>S. Anthony</hi> acknowledging, all good to come from heauen, sudenly gaue thanks to the diuine Goodnes, &amp; thence taking new confidence, thus answered the Deuill. Thou then for ought I can see, art a very coward, and hast little in thee: and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the age, and hew thou hast taken vpon thee, are right signes of great weakenes and basenes in thee: and added, For this reason alone, (quoth he) I will not care for thee. And concluded with great iubiley of hart: <hi>Dominus mihi adiutor, &amp; ego despiciam inimicos ineos.</hi> Scarcely had he begun to sing this goodly verse, of the hundred &amp; seauententh psalme, when the infamous seducer vanished quite, ful of rage, and confusion. And it was but iust, that the fierce encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and vercrate stratagems of that immortall substance, which had once the impious boldnes, to rise vp against the <hi>Highest;</hi> should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne thus scorned &amp; reproached by a yong man, encombred with flesh, and encompassed with infirmity.</p>
               <p>But yet for all this, <hi>S. Antony</hi> held not himselfe a whit secure, or out of danger: because he had well vnderstood ere now, how the wicked spirits, haue a thousand inuentions to hurt with. Heerupon taking al wais new courage, at the presence of God, he would neuer lay down the armes of iustice; nor yet discouered he only, from the strongest tower of holy fayth, with high contemplation, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try afarre off, but euen lay also in wayt with particular attention to be alwayes ready agaynst the domesticall enemies, not suffering in the Ports of the hart any thought to haue entrance, not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examined, and well known. He had all his parts subdued and restreyned with seuere lawes, and heasts. He would passe very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:12171:46"/>
whole mights in prayer, and when through extreme necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it behoued him to rest somewhat, he had no other bedd, then a peece of a mat, or the bare ground. Some two or three dayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather, would he be without eating or drinking awhit, and at last would refresh himselfe with nothing els, but bread, and a l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>le water, and salt.</p>
               <p>And heere it is to be noted, that he slackt not his rigour after he had thus continued a while as if he had done inough: nor mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured he the greatnes of his profit by continuance of tyme: But day by day, he would suppose he did but then beginne, remembring that saying of <hi>Elias: The Lord liues, in whose sight I do stand to day.</hi> In which saying, <hi>S. Antony</hi> would ponder on that word, <hi>to day:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well aduised, that the souldier of Christ, were to make no rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning of the trauayles, and yeares now passed ouer; but as if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day, he had but newly entred into the lists, so were he to be alwayes in a readines, to giue forth himselfe, as a glad spectacle to the diuine Maiesty, Men, and Angels. And now since mention i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In one of which causing himselfe to be shut vp, by a certayne friend of his, with order taken with him, to bring him bread within such a space; he heere would treate with none other, then himselfe, and God alone. For which the Prince of darknes, being now anew enflamed with rage, and fearing if he put not remedy to it in tyme, he should soone behold (to his irreparable losse) the desert likewise filled with Monasteries &amp; Monkes: sending presently to the Cell of <hi>S.

Whence might this siluer vessell seeme to come hither?

Which at the appearing of the <hi>Saint,</hi> as if they had been chased, went headlong away in al post; &amp; he damming vp the gate, with stone &amp; tymber, remayned within, with prouision of bread for six months: hauing left order with his friends, that twice a yeare (for which space and more some <hi>Egiptians</hi> knew, &amp; especially the <hi>Thebans,</hi> how to bake breake, &amp; make it last) should supply be made him, from tyme to tyme: with which suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and with a little water only to be had in the same place, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he his admirable sobriety, and singular abstinence.</p>
               <p>There came many to visit him, while he himself not withsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding being shut vp, saw them not, nor would suffer himselfe to be seen of any: and the bread I spake of, was let downe to him by certay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne holes in the roofe. In the meane while, his friends, attending with great desire at the doore, and passing that way many tymes by day and night, might heare from tyme to tyme, a very great noise within the roome, with raylings and outcryes, which sayd to him: Get you hence, out of our house.

And surely it was an admirable thing, that a soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary man, in so great a vastnes of regions, should haue no feare, neyther of infernall spirits, nor of dragons, nor wild beasts: but truly, according to the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> confiding in our <hi>Lord,</hi> like to Mount Sion, had alwayes his mind very peaceable, and quiet: so as the deuills had occasion to feare him, and the beasts laying their poyson and cruelty aside, became very meeke and tractable to him.</p>
               <p>But yet <hi>Lucifer</hi> ceased not to tempt him agayne, and to seeke alwayes to worke his annoyance, gnashing and grinding his teeth at him. And one night, among the rest while <hi>S. Antony</hi> was busy in prayer, he had leaue to set against him as many hurtfull beasts, as were to be found in those desert cliffs; who as forced to come forth of their dennes, were set on to encompasse the Seruant of <hi>Christ,</hi> making a proffer (as others heeretofore) to swallow and deuout him quite: but the vnderstanding the subtility of the Aduersary, told them, That if they had power from heauen, they might deuoure him, but if otherwise they came as sent by the deuill, without delay they should go their wayes, for he was the seruant of <hi>Christ.</hi> With which protestations, the brutish troupes, being affrighted &amp; scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, did suddainly fly away.</p>
               <p>From thence within few dayes, while he was making baskets, as he was wont, to bestow on them that dealt very charitably with him; he perceiued one of the wickers of his worke to be drawne to the doore-wards, and raysing vp himselfe, sees a monster, from the head to the hips, which appeared like a man, &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hips downe wards, was like an Asse. And yet was <hi>S. Antony</hi> not astonished a whit at so new, and straunge a spectacle; but rather making the signe of the Crosse on himselfe, defyed it boldly, as he was wont: whereupon the beast being scared, togeather with the spirits that guided it, so imperuously ranne from thence as falling downe head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, it dyed, representing in that fal the vnhappy aduenture of such
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:12171:57"/>
as would go about to driue away <hi>S. Antony</hi> from the Desert.</p>
               <p>Now after so many toyles of body and mynd, the Seruant of God was become Ninety yeares of age, &amp; could no more without manifest daunger, endure austerites as before.

Antony</hi> was nothing flack to obey. For scarce had the <hi>Aurora</hi> put forth, when without any other companion, then a little staffe, he puts himselfe into the voyage: and now was it about high Noone, and the parching rayes of the sunne beganne to scorch the head of the holy Old man, and yet neuerthelesse, would he not seeme to desist from going forwards, saying within himselfe: I haue a firme confidence in God, that he will shew me him he hath promised me to see. And standing to muse thereupon, behold a Hippo-centaur appeares before him, to wit, halfe a man, and halfe a horse. At which sight, arming himselfe with the holsome signe, on his forhead: <hi>Hola,</hi> said he, <hi>where abouts I pray you, inhabits a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne man of God?</hi> To which demaund, the beast, with a confused voyce, made offer to answere, and withall stretching form the right hand, seemed to point him the way, and flying vanished, nor could it euer be knowne, whether the same were a feigned appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or some reall thing.</p>
               <p>With such direction, did <hi>S. Antony</hi> follow on his way, deeply considering with himselfe on that strange figure, which he beheld a little before. He had not passed farre, thus musing with himselfe, but there appeared to him, in a craggy valley, a man of a little sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with a hawked nose, and horned countenance, who with a gratefull aspect, approaching to him, did offer him Dates, in signe of peace. Whereat <hi>S. Antony</hi> stood still, and laying hand on his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted armes, doubted not to aske him, <hi>who he was,</hi> and he answered so plainely as <hi>S. Antony</hi> was much astonished thereat. I am likewise mortall, said he, as you are, and one of the Inhabitants of the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes, adored by the blind Gentility, vnder the name of <hi>Fanus, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi>

At which words, the holy <hi>Abbot</hi> beganne to sheed teares for ioy, in beholding how the glory of <hi>Christ</hi> was dilated, and the power of Sathan annihilated, and smiting the ground with his staffe, addes: Wo be to thee <hi>Alexandria</hi> who giues the honour due to God, vnto Monsters &amp; Portents: Wo be to thee meretricious Citty, where haue all the superstitions of the world, built their neast now, wilt thou say? The beasts doe seeme to confesse <hi>Christ,</hi> and yet do you neuertheles, stand adoring of Idols.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Antony</hi> had not yet ended these wordes, when the Satyr as betaking himselfe to his wings in a moment, was quite vanished away. And to the end, that not any may hold it for a fabulous thing, it is to be vnderstood, that a like Monster to this, was brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where after it had been wel seene, and reuiewed, by all the people, it came to dye.

But then not hauing any instrument to digg his graue with, and with great anxiety thinking, &amp; bethinking himself what to do: Behold two Lyons, with their hayre layd open to the wind, to come run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at that tyme. Whence he at first being somewhat affrayd, and then taking courage in God, attended their comming, as so many Doues; and they being arriued to the corps, did humbly cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues at the feete thereof, with fanning in their manner, and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly roaring in signe of the sorrow they felt: and presently began with their feete to plough vp the sands, vntill such tyme, as there remayned sufficient roome for a man. Which being done, and as it were for their hire, receiuing the benediction of <hi>S.

               <p>After this, surueying the Heritage of the dead, for not to go thence, altogether empty handed, he tooke hold of the Cassocke of Palmes; and being returned home agayne as long as he liued af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in the solemnities of <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Pentecost,</hi> he would alwaies reuest himselfe therewith.

               <p>NOw it would be long, and superfluous heere, to explicate the ioy, which the Disciples shewed at the comming of their most sweest Father and Mayster, and he likewise reioyced as much to see them all, to be so seruent, with his presence and renewed in spirit. He had besides no small consolation, to find his <hi>Sister</hi> so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuering in the diuine seruice, being come to be Superiour of a most Noble, and numerous Conuent of Virgins. Now the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall of the <hi>Saint</hi> being knowne throughout all those Parts, a great multitude of persons of all qualityes resorted thither, to salute him, and to visit him as they were wont, and especially of the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: to whome he for entertaynement sake, insteed of presents, and gifts, would be giuing of precious aduertisements and aduises, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: They should alwayes hold firme their fayth, and dilection to God, and the Neighbour: They should guard themselues from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane thoughts, and delights: They should not not suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be deceyued with Gluttony: and should fly Vayne glory: continue their prayers: lay vp the documents of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in their breast: be allwayes reuoluing the actions, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of <hi>Saints,</hi> in mynd; endeauouring to reforme themselues, through the imitation of them.</p>
               <p>And principally, he aduised them not to cease to meditate on those words of the <hi>Apostle S.

It shall be also very profitable for vs to suruey with our Memory, the motions of our soule, and the workes which we dayly performe, and set them downe in writing, as if we were to giue accompt therof to others. Whence it shall come to passe, that for shame to be manifested to the world, we shall keepe our selues from falling into things which are worthy of reprehension. And with such a discipline refrayning the appetites, and subduing the flesh, we shall be able, very easily to conserue our selues in the grace of our Lord.</p>
               <p>These, and such like instructions, he fayled not to giue to his Monks, vpon good occasions. And for as much as among the secular multitude, there was continually a great number of lame, &amp; disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed people; he prayed afresh for them, but obteyned not equally forall: our Lord dispencing his graces, according to his good ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asure. And <hi>S. Antony,</hi> euen as when he was heard seemed not to vaunt himselfe; so when he suffered repulses, murmured he not, but alwayes gaue thankes to our <hi>Lord;</hi> &amp; exhorted the afflicted to haue Patience, and to be satisfyed, that their cure depended not on him, nor on men, but on God only, who affoardes health, when he wil, and to whome he lists. Wherupon, the languishing receiuing the words of the Old man, as from the mouth of God, learned to atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and suffer, and the cured came to acknowledge themselues bound not so much to <hi>S. Antony</hi> therefore, as purely to God. But what shall we say, besides al this, of the efficacy, which the Prayers of <hi>S. Antony</hi> had euen in persons, and places farre remote?</p>
               <p>He being in the Monastery, and on this side of the mountayne, the Count <hi>Hercolaus</hi> came humbly to beseech him to vouchsafe to intercede for the health of <hi>Policratia</hi> virgin of the Citty of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> a great seruant of God, who through much abstinence, and macera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the body, did feele most bitter dolours of the hips &amp; stomack and was quite fallen away and come to nothing: which the holy Father did with a very good will, and the Count noted the while in a little scrole the very day of the prayer. And being afterwards returned to <hi>Laodicea,</hi> and finding the virgin to be now on foote, &amp; free from all manner of paynes, to satisfy himselfe more fully, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were to be attributed to the prayer of the <hi>Saints,</hi> or no; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:12171:61"/>
of her, on what day she began to feele her selfe well; and hauing heard it, he presently tooke out the scrole, &amp; with the great astonishment of all, they found the <hi>Saints</hi> prayers, and recouery to haue happened on the selfe same day.</p>
               <p>In like manner, a certaine Courtier, called <hi>Frontone,</hi> that being tormented with a raging infirmity would haue eaten his tongue, &amp; pluckt out his eyes, had recourse to <hi>S. Antony.</hi> Who without any more ado, sayd to him: Go thy wayes, and thou shalt be healed. But <hi>Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone</hi> standing yet still for all that, and not departing thence for some dayes, the seruant of God replyed to him: Thou canst not be cured heere; Go thy wayes then into <hi>Egipt,</hi> &amp; thou shalt see wonders. And so it fell out, for scarcely was he arriued in those confines there, but his vehement sicknesse quite for sooke him.</p>
               <p>Many others likewise, whome it were too long to recount in this place, were by meanes of the <hi>Saint,</hi> deliuered from sundry, &amp; daungerous maladyes. Though the miracle of <hi>Frontone</hi> it seemes, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteynes not so much to the gift of <hi>Curing,</hi> as that of <hi>Prophecy.</hi> Which in <hi>S.

               <p>TWO <hi>Monkes</hi> on a tyme, being trauayling in the desert, came to fayle of water; in so much as the one of them dyed thereof, and the other seemed to lye in extremes. This, being reuealed to <hi>S.

And they diligently performing the same, found the one, as I said, departed, whome they buryed, &amp; brought succour to the other in good tyme, and being so escaped they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him to the <hi>Saint.</hi> Now for what cause, the same was not she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed him before, and why God would conserue the one, and not the other, seemes not to concerne me so curiously to seeke into.

               <p>Another day, he sitting on a hill, in company of others, sees

one ascending in the ayre, and many meeting of him, with very great ioy. Whereat <hi>S. Antony,</hi> remayning in admiration, and excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly desirous to know who it was; it was reuealed to him, to be the soule of <hi>Ammon</hi> a Monke, who dwelling in the Desart of <hi>Nitria,</hi> about some 13. dayes iourney from the residence of <hi>S. Antony,</hi> was wont notwithstanding to come sometymes to visit him. He was a person of rare vertue, and many miracles are likewise reported of him: and this one among others, that being once to passe ouer the riuer <hi>Licus,</hi> which at that tyme, was very much ouerflowne, he prayed <hi>Theodore</hi> his companion for his sake, to follow some distance from him, to the end by wading together, they might not be seene to ech other naked. So did the other, and yet for all that was <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> afterwards abashed at his owne skinne. And while he stood vpon such points, and bethought him thereof, I know not how, without touching the water, he sees himselfe on the other shore, in the twinckling of an eye: where likewise the other, being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards arriued, and seeing <hi>Ammon</hi> to be all clothed, and without any signe of wet vpon him, demanded the manner how he pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed ouer, and seeing he refused to participate the same with him, he tooke hold of his feete, and wrong him, and coniured him so much, as in fine he vnfolded the quality of his passage to him, with this pact notwithstanding, that he should not discouer it to any, till his death.</p>
               <p>Now the Monkes, as I sayd, seeing <hi>S. Antony</hi> with eyes so at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiue and suspended, very deerely intreated him, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale from them, what he saw: when as he answered, that <hi>Ammon</hi> was departed from these miseries, and was was gone triumphant to Heauen. Whereupon the disciples noted the day, and after a month some Brothers coming from <hi>Nitria,</hi> making a diligent comparison of tymes, they found, that <hi>Ammon,</hi> on that very very day, had pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to a better life.</p>
               <p>Another tyme, <hi>S. Antony</hi> sayling with some Monkes and other Seculars, began to smell a very loath some sauour, and all affirming it to be the smell of salt fish, and of dryed figs, he replyed, he felt another sent. And while he was thus affiming, there was heard a horrible cry to come from a yong man possessed of the deuill, who lay hid vnder the vpper decke of the ship. Then <hi>S.

not so much at the miracle, as at the purity of a soule, so quicke of sent, as to fauour the neerenes of the vncleane spirit. Besides, he was wont also to perceyue before hand, the comming of such, as came to see him, and the occasion wherefore: and many tymes, would foretell the one, and other, some three or foure dayes, and somty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes a month before they arriued at him.

               <p>Now the matter hauing passed thus a prety while, the trouble on the one side was intollerable to <hi>Eulogius,</hi> and he was now euen ready to acquit himselfe therof: on the other it seemed to him a great folly to loose through impatience, the trauayles and toyles of so lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g a tyme.

Of whome he was counsayled, that since the great <hi>S. Antony</hi> was aliue, he should be contented to repayre to that <hi>Oracle,</hi> and seeke fit remedy at his hands. Wherupon <hi>Eulogius</hi> did thinke it best so to do, in regard he had heard much commendatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the great Sanctity of that Holy man, and was glad to haue this opportunity to see him. To which end, <hi>Eulogius</hi> had prepared, though with great difficulty, a barke to put the Criple into, but not without much ado he got the miserable Wretch to be conueyed thereinto, with him: and so both of them went by water to the Monastery of the <hi>Saint,</hi> where being once arriued, <hi>Eulogius</hi> gladly attended his comming from the Hermitage, to visit the Brothers, and Ghests, as he was wont. Nor was it long; for on the night following the seruant of God, came into the publique view, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting for a tyme his diuine contemplations, and attending now to the good of his Brethren; &amp; causing all the strangers to be assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, according to custome, he sudda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ynely calls for <hi>Eulogius,</hi> very often by name, not known to him before: Who thinking there had been some other <hi>Eulogius</hi> present, held his peace for that tyme: But afterwards hearing himselfe to be called vpon a new, being halfe astonished, made answere; <hi>Behold I a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

With which words, <hi>Eulogius</hi> being much terrifyed, durst open his mouth no more. When <hi>S. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony</hi> turning himself to the infirme man, with a seuere countenance, and with a terrible voyce, beyond all expectation, sayd to him: Thou peruerse and abhominable Wretch, vn worthy both of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and earth: Thou neuer leauest fretting, &amp; quarrelling, to the offence of God: knowest thou not, that he who serues thee is <hi>Christ?</hi> How darst thou then so to mutter agaynst the diuine <hi>Maiesty?</hi> Is it not cleere, that <hi>Eulogius,</hi> only for the Loue of <hi>Christ,</hi> hath vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to haue care of thee, &amp; to do thee good? This sayd, he atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to giue audience to the others, and after some space of tyme, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to those two againe, with more benignity of speach, aduised them, saying: Beware my Children, you part not from ech other: but laying aside all rancour, &amp; bitternes returne you home againe, where you haue liued together, for so long tyme, because our <hi>Lord</hi> will soone be calling for you: and know, that so cruell a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hath not befallen you for ought els, then for being now so neere your End, and the reward of your labours: and take heed, you do not otherwise, for that if the Angell find you not so, you are in great daunger of loosing your Crownes.</p>
               <p>This manner of reprehension, with both, had the weight it ought to haue, and they departing without delay, by accord, went to their former habitation, and there passed not 24. dayes, but <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logius</hi> dyed: &amp; after three dayes more the Leaper followed him, very well disposed in the inward man, &amp; exceeding contrite.

               <p>TO this kind of visions, and Reuelations, may others be added, no lesse to the purpose of exciting the feare of God, and very worthy to be alwayes conserued in memory. Whereof one was, that <hi>S. Antony</hi> being one day in prayer, about the hower of Noone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore meate, he felt himselfe sudenly to be rauished in spirit, and it
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:12171:63"/>
seemed to him that he was carryed to Heauen, by some fauourable spirit. But in ascending some others of a proud and fierce aspect, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed themselues against him, who being repulsed by the Guard of <hi>S.

               <p>Then did the infernall Ministers dilate themselues against the seruant of <hi>Christ,</hi> in diuers accusations and calumnyes, but not being able to proue any, so ashamed, and confounded, in spight of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues they were feigne to let him passe. And at that very instant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, did <hi>S. Antony</hi> returne to himselfe, so strooke and astonished withall, as that forgetting his refection, he remayned all the rest of the day, and all the night, a sighing, and considering, with how many Enemyes vnhappy Man hath to deale withall. It came into his mind besides, how the <hi>Apostle</hi> not without good reason seemes to call the deuils, the <hi>Princes and Rulers of this ayre:</hi> exhorting the fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thfull, to betake them to the armour of God, that they may be able to resist him in that dreadfull day, and the spightful accuser may not haue wherewith to conuince them at that houre.</p>
               <p>Another tyme, after he had a while talked of the immortality of the Soule, with some that came to visit him; the next night, he heard himselfe called from aboue, with these words: <hi>Antony stand vp, go forth, and behold.</hi> Being gone out, he seees a foule and horrible Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Another day, he seemed to behold infinite snares, gins, and

Wherupon the disciples being affrayd, enforced him to manifest to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that which happened to him. Then the <hi>Saint,</hi> with many sobs, and with words interrupted, answered: O children, how much better were it to dye outright, then to behold the things to fall out, which haue now been declared to me. When they yet vrging him agayne, he addes, but with deepe sighs: The wrath of God hangs ouer the holy <hi>Church.</hi> Forlo, it is to be giuen vp into the power of bestiall persons. I haue seen the table of our <hi>Lord</hi> encompassed rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with lasciuious and vnbrideled mules, that with many kicks of the heeles, oppresse the Priests, and turne euery thing vpside downe. At which sight, I sighing amayne, and desirous to know the mistery, this voyce seemed to land in myne eares: <hi>My Aultar shall be profaned, and full of abhominations.</hi> But yet together with this euill newes, I haue likewise learned, how the storme shall soone passe ouer, and fayre weather agayne shall returne to the <hi>Catholiques.</hi> Both which Prophesyes, were shortly fulfilled.

               <p>These Ministers of the deuill, had sacked the Temple of <hi>Christ,</hi> and within sacred cloysters had violated the Virgins and Matrons there, made hauock of the pious people, and stayned the Yards, &amp; Chappels with innocent bloud, brought in the rabble, and the vilest

his hippe, whence being carryed to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> he dyed within three dayes, while all remayned astonished to see, how suddenly <hi>S. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonyes</hi> menaces were executed vpon him.</p>
               <p>In whose soule, besides so noble a gift of <hi>Prophesy,</hi> was seene also a rich ornament of <hi>Wisedome;</hi> not sprung from the curiosity of vnderstanding, but from purity of affect: not founded in meerespe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation or discourses, but in a sensible knowledge, and diuine Loue: not refined with the chayres, and scholasticall disputes, or written Bookes, but with liuely fayth, deuoute aspirations vpon the meruaylous volume of this great fabrique: Insomuch as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensity, and most swift, and ordinate motions of the heauenly sphears, the generation &amp; corruption of sublunary things, the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording concord of simple bodyes, the formes and differences of the mixt, the variety of inuentions, arts, customes, and accidents of men: but aboue all the sweet disposition, and infallible gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Eternall Prouidence, were to him, as well a glasse of verity, as an incentiue of Charity. And that which is more to be celebrated with these so great gifts, and treasures of profound know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg; he was so farre from being puffed vp with them; or once to thinke but vainely of himselfe, as how much more knowledge he got, so much the more he increased in true Modesty and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility. And especially he carryed a very singular respect, with an interiour and exteriour reuerence to the Interpreters &amp; Deposita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians of the diuine Scripture, such as are the Clarks, and Prelates of the holy Church, and as willingly demaunded, &amp; learned of them all, as if he had been the most rude and ignorant of the world: albeit on the other side, when need was, he would not sticke to giue a good account of himself, and of the fayth he imbraced to any person of what quality soeuer.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Arrians</hi> had spread throughout all <hi>Alexandria,</hi> with subtile lying, that <hi>S.

               <p>From such like aduertisements and protestations of the <hi>Saint</hi> the hearers tooke a great deale of pleasure, in seeing that pestiferous o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion so anathematized by such a Man: and all the inhabitants of the Citty, as well the Laicks, as Ecclesiasticall, as well Gentils as Christians, did striue to be the first in the Temple, to see the Man of God, (for so was he called of all) and there likewise, in the sight of them all, would he worke many Miracles, partly in expelling deuils, partly in curing: in so much as the very <hi>Pagans</hi> themselues, made instance to be touching at least of the garment of <hi>S.

               <p>THERE came on a tyme, as <hi>S. Antony</hi> was on this syde of the Mountayne, two Pagan Philosophers to him, to try him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while, and to proue what was in him: and he knowing a farre off,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:12171:66"/>
what manner of men they were, went forth to meete them, &amp; said to them by meanes of a good Interpreter: Wherfore haue you, being sage, and Philosophers as you are, taken such paynes, so to come to the house of a foole?

               <p>Others came afterwards of purpose to iest at him, as an Idiot, to whome he sayd: What thinke you? Which was the first, eyther wit or learning? Whereto the Philosophers answering, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, Wit was the first; and that by it, learning was found out. <hi>S.

               <p>BY these and such like things, may euery one easily imagine, how much daily the fame and renowne of <hi>S.

Who for to haue more easy accesse vnto him, sent to entreate the same at his hands, by meanes of prisoners, and guilty persons, who were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to criminall sentences, as knowing well such cases and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sityes,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:12171:68"/>
would not be despised of the seruant of Christ. Nor were they deceiued, since being vanquished by their prayers and teares, he went forth of his Hermitage, and came to exhort the Gouernour in passing sentence vpon them, by any meanes to preferre the feare of God before any passion, or human respect: remembring them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of that saying in the Ghospell, <hi>What measure you affoard to others, shal be likewise giuen to you.</hi> And with such manner of aduises as these, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned he, very many dispatches of suites, and releases of Innocents.</p>
               <p>For other personages, he forbare not with admirable modesty to remember them likewise of the vanity of the world, and the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of a solitary life: nor the same without fruite, for that many hauing left great riches, and honours, as well of warre, as of peace, haue conuerted themselues to a religious life. And in summe, in the person of <hi>S. Antony, Christ</hi> had affoarded a famous Phisitian to all <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi> What hart oppressed with sadnes which parted not cheerfull and content from him? What dolorous soule, for the death of their deerest friends, deposed not on a sudden their heauynes and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring? What wrathfull person, was not presently reduced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord? What beggar or Wretch, with his wordes and examples, that came not to make litle reckoning of money, and willingly to suffer the necessityes of life? What tepid Monke, resumed not againe new feruour? What young man, with the sight and discourses of <hi>S. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony,</hi> was not suddenly enamoured with chastity? What conscience afflicted and tempted of the Enemy, or molested with irksome thoughts, that was not immediately quietted. Because indeed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the vertues of this holy man (as we haue said aboue) one was so acute a discretion of spirits, as in the twinckling of an eye, he would know their inclinations and motions; and would not only suffer himselfe to be deceyued, but likewise giue opportune and excellent remedy to others, according to the necessityes of euery one. Besides, How many Virgins; already destined to matrimony, that with the only beholding of <hi>S. Antony</hi> a far off, haue been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated to <hi>Christ?</hi> And finally, as many as repayred to him, haue come their wayes from him much encouraged agaynst the Diuell, instructed against euill cogitations, comforted in tribulations, and full of vertuous, and holy purposes.</p>
               <p>True it is, that such manner of conuersation with men, was very cautiously dispensed by him, nor did he so giue himselfe to the care of others, as to be any whit vnmindfull of himselfe, but rather
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:12171:69"/>
assoone, as could be, in imtation of <hi>Christ,</hi> leauing the multitude, he would retire himself to prayer and solitude. Nor was the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of friends, or power of Princes, able to withdraw him from such manner of obseruance. To which purpose, we are not to passe ouer in silence, how a certayne Captayne, after he had visited him, being willing to entertayne him further in discourse, he gently excused himselfe, with that similitude of Fishes (so renowned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, and brought into a Prouerbe) that euen as those, remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning on the land, giue ouer and dye, so Monkes abiding too much with Seculars, do loose the feruour of the spirit; with which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison, the Captayne was well satisfyed, though much grieued the while to be seuered from him. But what great matter may it seeme, that <hi>S. Antonyes</hi> friendship, should so be desired of Rulers or Prefects of some Prouinces only, since we see it sought for no lesse of very Monarkes themselues, and of the Emperours of the world?</p>
               <p>It is a knowne thing, how <hi>Constantinus Augustus,</hi> and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces his sonnes, <hi>Constans</hi> and <hi>Constantius,</hi> sent him letters, as to a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, intreating him to vouchsafe to send them greeting, and good counsayle: but he was so alienate from worldly fauours, and so abhorred he euery least apparence of vanity, as he was vpon the point, not to accept the Epistles sent, saying to the Monkes, to whome it seemed to be some great honour to be so courteously greeted by the <hi>Caesars:</hi> Why meruayle you that a King should write to a man? Nay wonder rather, the immortall God, should write so his law to mortals, yea euen speake to them face to face by meanes of his only begotten Sonne. The magnanimous <hi>Abbot</hi> then (as we haue sayd) within a litle had refused to receiue the letters, at least he was resolued not to answere them at all, if through the prayers of his Monkes, and scruple which would arise of litle Edification, he had not been enforced in a manner to write backe, as he did: first with praysing those <hi>Lords,</hi> for the sayth they professed, &amp; then exhorting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to make no great reckoning of their present greatnes but to haue alwayes the future Iudgement in mynd, &amp; to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>Christ</hi> only, for the true, and eternall King; he concluded lastly in persuading them to be courteous and benigne, and to haue speciall care of the poore, and of Iustice.

               <p>With these, and other such like aduises, making an Epilogue as it were of the rest, he tooke leaue of his children, who vsing all violence to reteine him there, that they might be receiuing his last spirit, they could not procure the fauour, as well for many respects which he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cealed, as principally, to auoyd a certayne abuse, which the <hi>Egiptians</hi> had, to conserue with some art or other, the bodyes of persons of quality, vpon certaine beds, in performing their wonted Exequies indeed, &amp; en wrapping them after their manner in sheetes, but yet auoyding to put them vnder the ground, as a thing wholy vnworthy of them. Now was this abuse alwayes very much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing to <hi>S. Antony,</hi> and he had been reprehending the people for it at sundry tymes, and intreated the Bishops, often to remedy the same: alleadging that euen from the auncient <hi>Prophets</hi> themselues, were seen to bee sepulchers extant, yea that the body of <hi>Christ</hi> our <hi>Lord</hi> himselfe, had beene put in to a Monument, and was couered with a great stone, who arose the third day With which examples, howbeyt already, he had reduced many persons, to bury their dead; yet neuerthelesse, knowing the custome, and inclination of that people, he would not trust the multitude with his spoyles, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring himselfe into his Cell, from whence had he departed, within few months after fell sicke: and calling his two disciples to him, who had now some fifteene yeares been present with him, he spake to them in manner following.</p>
               <p>I am now (my deerest) vpon walking the way of my Fathers, and I feele my selfe to be called of our Lord.

But rather seeke to vnite your selues with <hi>Christ,</hi> and with his <hi>Saints;</hi> that after death, they may acknowledge you as Friends, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuing you into the Eternall tabernacles. Be this your opinion then, and this your discourse.</p>
               <p>And if you haue any care of me also, as of a <hi>Father,</hi> doe not suffer my Corps, by any meanes, to be carryed to <hi>Egypt,</hi> with the hazard of being put vp in some house, according to the peruerse cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the Country there; but hide me rather in the earth, in a place, where no person of the world, may know besids your sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, because if it be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sumed for the present, it shall yet be restored agayne very glorious in the Resurrection.

               <p>These were his last words, and then with a cheerefull counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, shewing the <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> to reioyce, who came to meete him, he gaue vp the Ghost. And the disciples, though sad for loosing such a Father on earth, neuerthelesse being recomforted, for hauing purchased such an Intercessour in Heauen, did bury him, according as he had ordyned. And to the Bishops, they gaue the garments, as welcome, and as much esteemed of them, as those who had gotten a very rich inheritance. And the great <hi>Athanasius,</hi> recounts of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, how he wore the same afterwards, very willingly: whereby it seemed to him, that he carryed about him, a perfect Memorial of the wholesome aduises, and documents of <hi>S.

The blessed <hi>Euagrius</hi> translated the same into latin, who liued very neere those tymes, and was the disciple of both the <hi>Macarius,</hi> enriching the same with some things receiued, as it is probable, of such as had much familiarity &amp; conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation with the Man of God.

               <head>Of the Birth of <hi>S. Pachomius,</hi> and his miraculous Conuersion to the Christian Fayth. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the same age (some few yeares after) the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Pachomius</hi> did flourish, a great Father likewise and an excellent Mayster of Monkes: whose vertue, and Religion, no doubt was so much the more memorable, as the helpe of Education, which he had was lesse, being borne of Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles both Father and Mother, &amp; brought vp in <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bais,</hi> without any knowledge of our <hi>Sauiour Christ,</hi> vntill such tyme, as he arriued vnto military age. Some notable signes did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run his Vocation. One was, that when they gaue him to drinke any wine, or other liquour, which had been offered to the Idols, with a certaine hidden auersion of the stomacke, he would sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be vomiting it forth. And another signe also was there yet of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:12171:72"/>
more wonder: for that, he being once conducted to a Sacrifice, which was to be performed, by a riuers side, hard by, there could be nothing done; for that at his presence, the Priest could neyther finish his ceremonies, nor would the Diuels seeme to enter into the Statues, to giue forth answeres, from thence, as they were wont: so as their wicked Minister, hauing finally vnderstood the occasion thereof, with furious brawling, began to controule the Parents of <hi>Pachomius,</hi> as hauing brought thither, an enemy of the immortall Gods: and commaunded them, suddenly to thrust him forth, as fearing least some heauenly wrath, or vengeance might light on their Sonne.</p>
               <p>Amidst so impious superstitions of his house, &amp; the rudiments of Egiptian learning and doctrine, <hi>S. Bachomius</hi> being arriued to the twentith yeare of his life, was enrolled as a Souldiour in a new leuy of men, which in the name of <hi>Constantius,</hi> was then made in diuers parts, against the Tyrant <hi>Maxentius.</hi> And with this occasion, being conducted by water with others, to a certayne Citty, neare vnto <hi>Thebes,</hi> he fell into great necessity, together with the whole army, through the smal prouision that was made of victuals for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Which being vnderstood, by those of the Country there, who by good hap, were of the faythfull people of <hi>Christ,</hi> and very friendly to the Neighbour, they suddenly prouided for the afflicted Souldiours, what was needfull for them; and that with so great sollicitude and charity, as <hi>S. Pachomius</hi> was astonished thereat: &amp; demaunding what nation they were of, that was so hospitable, and benigne; answere was made him they were Christians. When demaunding againe, of what manner of life &amp; institute they were, he vnderstood, that they did belieue in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> the only Sonne of God, and did well to all sorts of persons, with firme confidence, to haue some large re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muneration for it, at the hands of the same God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Pachomius,</hi> had scarcely heard these words, but that full, as well of interiour consolation, as of an vnusuall light, retyring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from the company, and being somwhat in a deepe study with himselfe, he lifted vp his hands to the starres, saying: <hi>Lord God,</hi> who framedst the Heauen and earth, if thou shalt vouchsafe to regard my basenes, and my trauayles, and giue me the knowledge of thy Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; I promise to serue thee, and obey thy precepts while I breath. With this prayer, and promise, the loue of vertue so increased in him, as he began, from that tyme forwards through the diuine Grace
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:12171:73"/>
to resist all sensuality, and valiantly to suffer Tribulations; helping himselfe with the memory of his first purposes, vntill such tyme, as the <hi>Emperour,</hi> hauing gotten a glorious victory vpon the Tyrant, he was cashiered with others: and not seeing opportunity there to become a Christian, he immediately went his wayes to <hi>Chemosium,</hi> a Towne of the higher <hi>Thebais,</hi> where remayned some notable and venerable Seruants of God. Of whome, being instructed in the holy Fayth, he was baptized: and the very same night, that he receiued this wholsome Sacrament, he sees in his Sleepe his right hand to be filled with dew, which falling from heauen, did incorporate it selfe in forme of hony, and withall heard a voyce, which said: <hi>Open the eyes of thy vnderstanding Pachomius, and know, that this is a signe of the grace, which is affoarded thee by Christ.</hi> This vision was not in vayne or vnprofitable a whit, but rather <hi>Pachomius</hi> felt himselfe so compund therewith, and enflamed with diuine Loue, as he determined, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay, to renounce the world, &amp; to consecrate himselfe to a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasticall life. And hauing heard of a famous Hermit, called <hi>Palemon,</hi> that dwelt in those desarts, he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t his wayes to him, to submit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to his discipline.</p>

               <p>THis <hi>Palemon</hi> for yeares was very graue, seuere of countenance, &amp; so rigid and mortifyed in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersation, as by many he was iudged to be inimitable. So soone as he heard then, one knocking at his cell, opening the doore, he sayd to <hi>Pachomius. Who art thou? and what seekes thou?</hi> To whome the good young man answering: <hi>God sends me to you to be admitted into your estate of life.</hi> The old man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed. This is no worke for you, not so easy as you thinke; for some three or foure others, haue come hither likewise that haue not been so well able to stand to it afterwards. Then <hi>Pachomius:</hi> All men are not made of the same mould. Do you receiue me, and in tyme (I trow) you shall be cleered in that point. I haue told you already (replyed the Hermit) that you cannot brooke the labour. Go your wayes then first to do pennance in some other place: and if you shall then thinke your selfe able to endure it, do you come to me, &amp; then perhaps I shall accept of you. Because indeed my manner of liuing (for to tell it you) is very sharpe, and difficult. I susteyne my

selfe (God be thanked) with no other thing, then bread and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>These and the like words, though deliuered. with a harsh voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and a horride brow, were not sufficient to terrify the constant <hi>Pachomius,</hi> but rather, as a litle water spurted on a great fyre, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled such a flame in his breast, as with much reuerence, he most cheerfully affirmed, that he felt in his mynd, a firme beliefe, that the diuine Goodnes, by meanes of the intercession of the same <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> (whose life was a mirrour to all Mortalls) would make him a disciple not vnworthy of so noble a Mayster. From such perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, vnited with like piety, the <hi>Anchoret,</hi> now easily gathered, that <hi>Pachomius</hi> had an extraordinary feeling, and a manifest voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God. Whereupon, hauing now some confidence of a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py successe, without more ado, he admits him into his Cell, and giues him his habit. And from thence, they began to liue together, spending the greater part of the tyme in deuotions, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>est, in twisting of Camels hayre, and making of sacks, and that not to pick out money for their owne profit, but to relieue the poore with, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> counsayles.</p>
               <p>At night then, in tyme of prayer, and Psalmes, if <hi>Palemon</hi> perceiued the disciple to be somewhat pressed with sleep, taking him forth of his Cell, with a basket in hand, he would employ himselfe with him, in carrying of heapes of sand, to and fro, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till such tyme, as the superfluous vapours of the body being disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by this meanes, he might come to be prompt, &amp; nimble againe, and haue the spirit now throughly awaked; and would besides be admonishing him, saying: be you sober and attentiue <hi>O Pachomius,</hi> that you be not ouercaught by the Tempter, and all our labours proue not to be in vayne. But the seruent <hi>Nouice,</hi> gaue not much occasion vnto spurs and incitements, and the holy <hi>Father</hi> exulted in himselfe, and glorifyed the Diuine Clemency, to see him become euery day, more obedient then other, to see him more addicted to mortification, and abstinence, he not sparing in the meane while to go alwayes before him, with a liuely, and continuall example.</p>
               <p>So as once vpon Easter day, <hi>Pachomius</hi> to solemnize that Feast, hauing dressed him a litle Oyle, seasoned with salt, when <hi>Palemon</hi> saw him to reach it to him, suddaynely striking his forhead, &amp; ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting

In such like acts <hi>Pacho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi> continually beheld himselfe, as in a glasse: and as from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Mayster, he was hourely encouraged more to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the good; so from others defects, became he alwayes more cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to beware the euill.</p>

               <p>AN audacious <hi>Monke</hi> but ill founded in the knowledge of himselfe, and human frailty, came on a tyme to see <hi>Palemon</hi> and <hi>Pachomius,</hi> while they had made by chaunce a very good fyre: &amp; after he had sate downe with them a pretty while, entertayning themselues with spirituall discourses, arising on a sudden, sayd to <hi>Palemon:</hi> if you, and your disciple haue true Fayth, shew me heere some Euangelicall experience thereof, and make your prayer, heere barefoote, vpon these burning coales. <hi>Palemon</hi> reprehending him for it, and aduising him, not to suffer himselfe to be deceyued so by the enemy; he puffed vp with greater pride, and presumption, went voluntarily vpon the Coales, and the Diuine Maiesty, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it so, the Diuell had power to preserue him without hurt at all.

But it was not long, ere he payd very soundly for it.</p>
               <p>For first, being deluded by the ancient Aduersary with lasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious shapes, and therupon very grieuously strooke and afflicted, he repayred agayne, after some dayes to <hi>Palemon,</hi> with sighes confessing his errour, saying: Know that I am vndon, for not hauing obeyed you, and now I do pray you, to succour me, with your prayers, for
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:12171:74"/>
that I stand in great daunger, to be slayne of the infernall Enemy. The wretch was yet a speaking, and <hi>Palemon</hi> and <hi>Pachomius</hi> a wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping for compassion; when lo, on a sudden, the deuill assaults him, takes him out of the Cell, and like a sauage beast, chàsing him a good while through the Crags, and Mountaynes, finally in the Citty, which is called <hi>Pun,</hi> tooke away his wits, so as he cast him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe headlong into a fornace of a bath, where suddaynely he dyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.

Besides, when he read or recited any things of the sacred scripture, he posted not in hast, as many are wont, but tasting, and ruminating the sentences, &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, one by one, he sought to deriue profit from them, and to serue the Highest with fit attention. Being often sent barfoote, to make wood, in a certayne forrest, very full of sharpe thornes, while he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>It happened to him afterwards, on a tyme, by a certayne oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, to arriue at the Iland, and Towne of <hi>Tabenna;</hi> where, being in a long, and profound Prayer, he heard a vovce to say to him: <hi>Pachomius, stay heere, and set vp a Monastery in this place, because many shall come vnto thee with desire to be saued whome thou shalt guide according to the instruction which I shall giue thee.</hi> And with this, an <hi>Angell</hi> appeared, and gaue him a Table, wherein the same Institute was conteyned, which for many ages afterwards, the Monks of <hi>Tabenna</hi> obserued. Then <hi>Pachomius,</hi> with the discretion of spirits which he had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased, very cleerely perceiued, that as well the vision, as the Rule was a heauenly thing: and receiuing the same with great Reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, he went to his Mayster, and communicated the whole with him: beseeching him to be pleased, to put to his helping hand, in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution

of what, had beene ordeyned him, by the Angell. And though <hi>Palemon</hi> otherwise, would very vnwillingly haue left his auncient Cell, notwithstanding to comfort so good and vertuous a disciple, he was perswaded to go thither, and they both set vp there a poore habitation, in forme of a Monastery. But it was not long, ere <hi>Palemon,</hi> being now spent, partly with old age, and partly with maceration of the body, arriued to the end of his dayes; and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chomius,</hi> as in life he had alwayes obeyed, and serued him, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite diligence; so after death, with extraordinary feeling, buryed him, with his owne hands, with a great deale of Lamentation, but not without Canticles and Hymnes.</p>

               <head>A Brother of <hi>S. Pachomius</hi> ioynes himselfe with him in his manner of lyfe; and what followed. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.</head>
               <p>AFter this, a naturall Brother of <hi>S. Pachomius,</hi> becomming a Christian, and called by the name of <hi>Iohn,</hi> being likewise tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with a laudable desire of a perfect life, came to seeke him, and to inhabite with him. They remayned full fifteene yeares together continually exercising themselues, in acts of religion, &amp; pennance. At the end wherof, while now it seemed to <hi>Pachomiuhs,</hi> it would not be long, ere that came to effect, which had been promised him of the multiplication of Monkes, he began anew, to enlarge the dwelling, to be able to receiue them all. This fact of his, was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing to <hi>Iohn,</hi> and as he, who was the elder in yeares, and perhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes, knew not, or not fully belieued, what was signifyed to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chomius</hi> from Heauen, esteemed such a building, to be against Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty, and therfore reprehended his Brother, somewhat bitterly for it, saying, he should cease from committing such follyes, so to seeke to enlarge himselfe, more then needed. To which words, though he answered nothing, yet did he in wardly thinke vpon the and after hauing some remorse at such a thought, retyring himselfe at night in the new building, he puts himselfe into bitter Laments and turning himselfe to God, with great dolour cryed out in this manner.</p>
               <p>Alas, that the prudence of the world, should be yet continually raigning in me! I am still a carnall man, and after so many yeares of Religious warfarre, doe I yet suffer my selfe to be vanquished by wrath, vnder a colourable pretext of good.

I belieue thy benignity is exceeding great, help me <hi>Lord,</hi> &amp; I shall walke in the way of thy Elect; aduauncing my self alwaies forward, &amp; forgetting quite what remaines behind. Euen as they likewise through thy grace, haue done, to their euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting prayse, and crowne, but to the great affliction, and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter confusion of the aduersary: otherwise, how shall I be able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct those, whome thou saydst, thou wouldst giue me in charge, if first I shall not subdue the passions, which by meanes of the flesh, make warre against the spirit, and if I shall not haue learned to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue thy Law inuiolable? But I hope Lord, through the help of thy high and mighty hand, I shall do that, which may like thee best, and thou pardon all my defects.</p>
               <p>In such accusations of himselfe as these, ioyned with bitter playnts, with burning prayers, and with solid purposes, spent he all that night, &amp; at the apearing of the day he found on the ground, a certaine durt which was there caused through the continuall tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, that streamed from his eyes; as also with the excessiue sweat, which tricked downe from all his body. Nor let any one seeme to attribute this, to an exaggeration of words: for that besides the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which contrition wrong from him, and affliction of mynd; it was then likewise the season of Summer, and the place of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was exceeding hoat: nor was the seruant of God, then making his prayer in a carelesse kind of composition of body, but eyther on his knees, or prostrate, or bolt vpright, with the armes erected &amp; distended in forme of a Crosse, without letting them once to fall, or leaning himselfe to any thing, vntill the tyme he had purposed to himselfe; and this, as well to suffer something with <hi>Christ,</hi> and for <hi>Christ,</hi> as by that meanes to keep his mynd more vigilant, and attentiue.</p>
               <p>With this sacrifice of an humble and penitent hart, he obtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned so much fauour from heauen, as for the tyme to come, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuered with his Brother, in meruaylous Peace, and Patience: and assoone as he passed into a better life, he interred him, with all due piety, &amp; with the wonted Exequyes.

               <p>IN the meane tyme <hi>S. Pachomius</hi> was very grieuously molested by Hellish Monsters, being all enflamed with Enuy against him, &amp; desirous to put any obstacle soeuer to so great a good; so as putting in practize whatsoeuer was permitted them, with diuers appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and strange phantasmes, they sought to affright the seruant of God. Among other on a time, being about to kneele to his Prayers, the earth on a sudden fell a gaping before him, in forme of a deepe Cesterne, to swallow him vp. At other times, returning from the more remote deserts, where sometymes through desire of greater solitude, he was accustomed to retire himselfe; vpon the sudden, the same peruerse spirits were before him, marching as it were in order of battaile, and saying with a loud voyce: Giue place to the Man of God. They endeauoured likewise to shatter the new buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in such sort, as it seemed they would haue turned it topsy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turuy from the very foundations. Besides, sitting on a day at some handy worke, after he had made his prayer, there seemed a Cock to be represented to him of an vnmeasurable greatnes, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubling very fierce, and horrible crowings, aduentured from tyme to tyme to fly in his face, and with the clawes, and spurs most cruelly scratched him.</p>
               <p>These, and other affrights and iniuryes <hi>S. Pachomius,</hi> being full of a high confidence in God, very easely repelled, now with the signe of the most holy crosse, now with some verse of the sacred Psalter. Wherupon the malignant spirits, perceiuing the way of feare, succeeded not with them; turned themselues by agreement to tempt him, with laughter, in shewing themselues very busy &amp; earnest to remoue certayne leaues of a tree therby, tying them with great ropes, and exhorting one another to pull hard, with voyces and vnited forces, much after the manner, as Carpenters are wont to do, when they lift some huge piece of tymber. But this trick of theirs, was not any whit sufficient to moue the grauity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:12171:76"/>
of the Christian Philosopher; but rather sighing, insteed of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>But yet for all this, they ceased not afterwards, to renew the battaile agayne, by taking the habit and forme of beautifull women and endeauouring to sit downe at the Table with the Man of God in tyme of refection, and to be impudently putting their hands into that poore fare, which he had before him; when seeing themselues to be howerly vanquished and despised, chaunging their figures by diuine dispensation to the greater crowne of the <hi>Saint,</hi> they afflicted him more then once with sundry paynes &amp; cruel torments. Wherin as he, through the help of <hi>Christ,</hi> remayned alwayes, victorious; so according to the saying of the Scripture, it often happened, that he walked, and that without hurt, vpon venemous beasts; and which is more, being to passe the Riuer of <hi>Nilus,</hi> when need was, the Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codils themselues, insteed of a bark, would securely be wasting him ouer.</p>
               <p>With such proofes, and so glorious victoryes, <hi>S. Pachomius</hi> now being arriued to the highest degree of hope and charity, the Angell appeared to him anew, and sayd to him: <hi>God is pleased, O Pachomius, with thy seruice, and would haue thee reconcile the Gentils vnto him.</hi> When not many dayes after, some persons, desirous to saue their Soules, and glutted with the world, beganne to repayre vnto him from diuers places, who benignly receiued them all, but yet gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not the Monasticall habit, till first he had proued euery one with a long and exact probation.</p>
               <p>The manner he held in the instructing of all together, and ech one in particuler, consisted, in keeping them free, and farre off from all traffique, and transitory cares; and to vnite them, first from the world, then from the hauing of things proper, and lastly from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. And forasmuch as to exhort others to the Crosse, examples do moue a great deale more, then words; he was the first in obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of Silence, in Edification, Lessons, Fasts, Vigils, and other labours, and austerityes of the Monastery, to prepare the Table, to cultiuate the garden, to answere at the gate, to be seruing of the Sick both night and day, and hence with louing aduices, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances withall, would he afterwards very easely conduct others, to

ancient symbols, for our saluation, hath succeeded the diuine word it selfe: who assuming our human flesh, hath taken vs from the paynes of our sinnes, through the holy light of the Ghospell, and with the satisfaction of his infinite merits.</p>
               <p>This said, he confessed he had heard this interpretation from the great <hi>Pachomius</hi> himselfe, who had lately gathered togeather good number of Monks in the Iland of <hi>Tabenna,</hi> and gouerned them with merueilous discipline; and I hope (added he) that the mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this Man of God, now made by me, may impetrate for vs some indulgence of our sinnes. The good Monke had scarce finished his discourse, when <hi>Theodore</hi> was enflamed with the relation made, with an exceeding desire of knowing <hi>S. Pachomius</hi> by sight, and to giue himselfe wholy to be gouerned by him. In so much, as a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and good Old man, called <hi>Pecusius,</hi> being come thither from <hi>Tabenna,</hi> for to visit that Congregation there, was by <hi>Theodor</hi> intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated at his returne, with great affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he would be pleased to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct him with him to the blessed <hi>Pachomius,</hi> as he did with a very good will, and being arriued at the holy place, the youth, not being able to conteyne himselfe from teares of Ioy, was receiued by him with a great deale of charity, and numbred with the others; when in a short tyme, he profited so much in all manner of vertues, as <hi>S. Pachomius</hi> himselfe, did wonder at it.</p>
               <p>There was afterwards an occasion presented to make the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy and feruour of this <hi>Nouice</hi> more renowned. In reguard the Mother, being now become a widow, and not brooking the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of her sonne; came to <hi>Tabenna</hi> in person, bringing letters fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Bishops with expresse order to haue him restored her agayne. Heere now, she being receiued by the Nuns, as a guest, she speedily sent the letters to <hi>S. Pachomius,</hi> vrging the execution therof. When the seruant of <hi>Christ,</hi> hauing called <hi>Theodore</hi> to him, said to him in this sort: I vnderstand thy Mother is come to see thee, behold the Letters of the Bishops, which she hath brought me, for that end. Go thy wayes then, and comfort her, especially for the Prelates sakes who haue recommended it to me. <hi>Theodore</hi> answered. Do you giue me security then, <hi>Reuerend Father,</hi> that this little edification, which I shall giue vnto others, with such an enteruiew, be not imputed to me, at the day of Iudgment? Forasmuch as if in the tymes before grace, the children of <hi>Leui,</hi> did quite forsake their Parents, howbeyt most deere vnto them, for to serue the <hi>Lord God</hi> wholy: how much

Pachomius</hi> declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe better vnto him, with saying: If it seeme not expedient to thee my <hi>Sonne,</hi> I will not vrge thee to it, but rather confesse the other to be of more perfection; because indeed the Monke is to fly al world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commerce, and be louing, with an ordinate affection, &amp; without passion, all those who through fayth, are members of <hi>Christ.</hi> And if any would seeme to oppose, that he may not desist from wishing well to his owne bloud, let him note that saying of the Scripture, <hi>That euery one becomes the slaue of him, that vanquitheth him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this manner of speach, the good Youth, being now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed more, and more, would by no meanes, shew himselfe to his Mother. And it pleased our Lord, through this austerity of his, that she remained so astonished and moued to deuotion as she deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined likewise herselfe to leaue the world, and with the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>S. Pachomius,</hi> was receiued into the number of the Seruants of <hi>Christ.</hi> Whence may be gathered, that things being done to the greater glory of God, howbeit in the beginning sometymes, they may seeme perilous and bitter: yet neuerthelesse through diuine dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, do they produce many tymes most sweet fruites.</p>

               <p>Why, <hi>Theodore,</hi> because we haue power ouer the labours of our Brethren, and to vs the care belonges to prouide and distribute the portions among them; should we therefore at our pleasure, and without any regard be treating of our selues in this sort, or be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of any thing superfluous, or out of tyme, and comon custome? And where should our holy <hi>Feare</hi> be then, if we should do so?

                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>AINT MARTYN</hi> a great Seruant of <hi>Christ,</hi> and an excellent maintayner of the Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call dignity, and discipline; was borne in <hi>Saba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> a Citty of <hi>Pannonia</hi> in <hi>Hungary,</hi> of Patents in repute of the world, very honourable, and noble, but yet Gentils, and farre from Christ. The Father being enrolled in the Roman war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, in processe of tyme, came to be a Tribune of Souldiours, or as we say, a Coronell of a Regiment, by whome <hi>S. Martin,</hi> being lead into <hi>Italy,</hi> yet a child, was trayned vp in <hi>Pauia,</hi> in feates of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes; howbeit, though naturall instinct, he was enclined a great deale more to the acts of peace, or rather to Christian Religion. In so much, as being yet but ten yeares old, agaynst the will of his friends, he went secretly to the Church, and with instance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:12171:89"/>
to be made a Catechumen. Within two yeares after, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired likewise to retire himselfe into the desert: &amp; he had done it in effect, if his tender age had not been an impediment to him. To w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> disturbance of his holy designes, was further added a new leuy, which then was made of military men, with expresse order, that all the sonnes of old Souldiers, should be put into the roule, and conducted to the war. Whereupon <hi>S. Martin,</hi> being now some fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeares old, being discouered by his owne Father, was against his will, enforced to repayre to the Ensignes of <hi>Constantius</hi> the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</hi> He would haue no other in his company, then a slaue only, whome yet he would be seruing rather, then be serued by him, to wit, in often pulling off his shoes, and brushing his clothes, &amp; fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing the table with what was needfull.</p>
               <p>With this disposition of mind, being come to the field, some three yeares before his baptisme, he allwayes preserued himselfe wonderous pure, and vntouched of those vices and debauchements, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>n which Souldiours are for the most part wont to be inuolued. First for his person, he would seeme to content himselfe with fare so moderate and simple, as from that tyme he seemed to be rather a Monke, then a Souldiour: besids he would seeme to content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with those kind of meates, which others vtterly refused to eate off: moreouer he would shew himself very benigne and courteous, to his Camerades, and to all others, bearing with their defects, and supplying the necessity of euery one, with extraordinary charity, patience, and humility. He would comfort the afflicted with loue and dexterity, and be very helpfull to the sicke: and without thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the morrow, he would feed most liberally the hungry, but with particular tendernes cloth the naked; in which worke of piety, was a certayne act of his very memorable, which we shall tell you in the next Chapter.</p>

               <head>The singular Charity of <hi>S. Martyn</hi> to a poore man. And how he leaues the warres, and betakes him to another Course. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.</head>
               <p>THe Roman Army, at this tyme, was lodged in <hi>France,</hi> in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding cold places, and in the hart of a winter much more cruell, then vsed to be in that place; in so much as many men, euen dyed frozen in the streetes. Now it happened, in the Gate of <hi>Amiens,</hi> that a poore man, quaking with his naked body exposed to the shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penes
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:12171:90"/>
of the ayre, very pittifully craued some succour of the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours, that passed then along, in the company of <hi>S. Martyn;</hi> and the wretch being not heeded by any of them, <hi>M. Martyn</hi> apprehended straight, how that merit by the diuine prouidence, was reserued for him. But what could he do, in such a case? He had not a penny of mony about him, hauing now already spent all, in other Almes: And in fyne, had nothing els but his armes, and a short cloake on his back. What resolution tooke then the Man of God? Taking out his sword, of a sudden, he diuided the same into halfes, and giues the one part therof, to the wretch, and the other keepes to himselfe to couer him the best he could. At the sight of such a strang habit, &amp; remnant of cloath, as some of the more youthfull of them, could hardly conteyne themselues from laughing, so others more stayed then they, were worthily touched ther with, as knowing how wel they might haue cloathed him, without despoyling of themselues.</p>
               <p>Now in truth, how much God was pleased with this charity of <hi>S. Martyn,</hi> he seemed to demonstrate the night following, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring before him, with that piece of garment, on his owne person, and bidding him to looke and marke well, whether it were not the Garment he had giuen to the poore man, the day before. Wherup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> with a sweet countenance turning himself to a multitude of Angels which attended him, he added with a lowd voyce: <hi>Martyn, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>From this so noble a vision <hi>S. Martyn</hi> tooke not a whit of vayne glory, but acknowledging and magnifying in all, and through all the heauenly grace; he tooke rather a motiue thence of greater hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and diligence, in the diuine seruice. So as without more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, he hyed him to Baptisme, being then about eighteen yeares of age, and withall to giue himselfe more freely to a perfect life, he was euen ready to bid adieu to the military state, but being constreyned through the importunity of his Tribune (who hauing finished his office, promised to follow him,) he differed yet the execution of his holy purpose, for the space of two yeares: in all which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Not long after, being admonished by God, in sleepe, to go his wayes to reuisite his countrey, and help his friends, who as yet were not out of their Pagauisme, he demaunded leaue for this end, of the holy Bishop, to go thither: Who graunted it, indeed, though with a very ill will; intreating &amp; coniuring him, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out teares, to returne backe againe, as soone as he could.

of another who for that end, leading him to a place more remote began to demaund of him, who he was? and <hi>S. Martin</hi> answered, he was a Christian. Art thou not affrayd, replyed the Thiefe? And he with an incredible constancy affirmed, that he was neuer lesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayd in his life, since he knew very well, the diuine Mercy, to be then most present, with such as trusted therin, when they found themselues in the greatest perils of all: but I am sory for thee (quoth he) that makest thy selfe wholy vncapable, &amp; vnworthy therof, by the life thou leadest. And with this ouerture very dextrously falling into the Ghospell, with holsome and efficacious words, so moued that soule, as he was conuerted to <hi>Christ,</hi> and with a full deliberatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of changing his manners, did secretly put the Pilgrime in his way, beseeching his Charity to vouchsafe to reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend him to our Lord: which he did, and not without fruite, forasmuch as this very Thiefe afterwards came to be a Religious man, who euen told vs this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular himselfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Martyn</hi> then pursuing his voyage, hauing passed <hi>Milan,</hi> was met by the Deuill, in forme of a man, who would needs know, whither he went: and being told by <hi>S. Martyn,</hi> that he was going whither God had called him, the Enemy replyed: Go whither thou wilt, or whatsoeuer thou takest in hand, Know, that the Deuil wil be alwayes contrary to thee. Then <hi>S. Martyn</hi> answered with the <hi>Prophet: Dominus mihi adiutor, non timebo quid faciat mihi homo.</hi> At which words, the Impostour immediately vanished: and <hi>S. Martyn</hi> after some dayes, being arriued in his Country, attended the first thing he did, with all endeauour to procure the saluation of his Parents, but not with like successe; since the Mother came to be a Christian while the Father could not be stirred from the impious worship of the Idols. Yet there wanted not in his place many others, who through the example, and with the exhortation of <hi>S. Martyn,</hi> were brought into the right way of eternall life.</p>
               <p>Besides this, there was another occasion for him, to employ wel the talents which he had receiued, and to shew forth the zeale he had of the holy Fayth. Because the Arrian Heresy, at that tyme, with particular successe hauing extended it selfe into the parts of <hi>Sclauonia,</hi> and all those confines there, <hi>S.

               <p>Whereupon <hi>S. Martin,</hi> being thus molested on euery side, falling into the company of a certayne Priest, a great seruant of God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined for that tyme to hide themselues.

Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyn,</hi> if being brought to extreames therewith he had not made his recourse to prayer, and with this remedy had not suddenly expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all dolour and daunger.</p>
               <p>After this, it was not long ere he knew, how <hi>S. Hilary</hi> hauing sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d grace with the <hi>Emperour Constantius,</hi> returned into <hi>France.</hi> At which newes being exceeding ioyfull, he trauayled towards <hi>Rome,</hi> to meete with him there, and to accompany him to his Church. But <hi>S.

Among these, there was a certaine Catechumen, who falling sick of a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent feuer, while <hi>S. Martin</hi> was farre off (for three dayes only) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout certaine affayres of the diuine seruice, beyond all expectation, departed this lyfe, and that which was worse, without Baptisme. The Conuent was sensible of this case: and <hi>S. Martin</hi> at his returne,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:12171:92"/>
finding now the Exequies prepared, very sorowful and sad thereat approched his body. Heere now conceiuing in his pure mind new feruour of spirit, he makes them all go forth of the chamber; and the doores being shut stretches himselfe, like another <hi>Elizaeus,</hi> vpon the cold bones of the deare Brother, and so hauing made a feruent prayer, and very soone perceiuing already, through diuine vertue, how the vitall spirits were vpon returne, standing something vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right agayne, with his eyes fixed on the face of the dead man, he stood couragiously expecting the effect of his prayers, and of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine clemency. There were not yet two houres of tyme past, when he saw the dead to moue his lymmes, by litle and litle, and panting to open the eyes, and to recouer the vse of his senses. Then <hi>S. Martin</hi> giuing thankes to our <hi>Lord,</hi> cryed out so lowd, as they who expected without, being moued with the noise therof, came rushing in, and all perceiued, to their infinite astonishment, the corps to res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and take vigour agayne, which euen now they were ready to carry to buriall.</p>
               <p>After so great a benefit had, the <hi>Cathecumen</hi> delayed not a whit to receiue the holy Baptisme, whereunto he suruiued many yeares after, and was wont sincerly to recount of himselfe, how being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the body, he was presented before a Tribunall, and by sentence confined to darkesome place, among the baser sort; but how at the same instant, two Angels relating to the Iudge, how it was he for whome <hi>S.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission giuen, to restore him to life agayne, and to make a present of him to the seruant of God. This was the first wonder <hi>S. Martyn</hi> shewed forth in those parts; whence it followed, that being now held for holy, he bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> afterwards to be esteemed also as a man very powerfull with God, and a person truly Apostolicall. Not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, passing through the fields of one <hi>Lupicinus</hi> an honourable &amp; rich man, there met him a troupe of people all full of laments, and teares, telling him, how one of the seruants of <hi>Lupicinus,</hi> had hanged himselfe, &amp; so miserably had ended his dayes. <hi>S.

These things now pierced the very hart of the holy <hi>Pastour,</hi> who after he had prayed to our <hi>Lord</hi> for him, stuck not with much sweetnes, and grauity, both of words and countenance, to set before him the enormous scandall that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of so great a mutation of manners in him, intreating him withall to be thinke himselfe of the ancient purposes, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, how the state of the Clergy, did not acquit him at all of the perfection of a Monke, but that rather the name did seeme to oblige him; to haue in horrour and contempt all the delights and pleasures of the world, since thereby was vnderstood, he had left to others their transitory things, and with the <hi>Prophet</hi> had chosen, for portion and inheritance, God only.</p>

Martyn</hi> then being aware of the danger, with the wonted courage of a liuely fayth, mounted vp speedily to the roofe, &amp; puts himself against the flames; and it is certaine, that at the only appearing of the Man of God, the flames, as timerous to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him, in a moment seemed to fetch about, &amp; to be retorted, and gathered within themselues, &amp; in the sight of all, in striuing against the violence of the wind, to retire in such sort, as the priuate buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings remayned very safe; and <hi>S.

That therfore, he might returne bouldly to the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize agayne, and not feare any impediment whatsoeuer. So <hi>S. Martin</hi> did, and in the presence of all those Pagans, who through diuine power, stood the while immoueable, he ruined the profane bulke from the very foundations, destroyed the Aultars, &amp; reduced the images vnto dust. Whence succeeded another great benefit, that the Gentils, perceiuing themselues so bound and stupifyed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being able to rise against the Bishop, knew the effect to be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by a supreme power, and they all, as it were, came to belieue in <hi>Christ,</hi> exclayming with one voyce, and confessing, that the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>God</hi> of <hi>S. Martin,</hi> was to be adored, and that, for the Idols, they were to make no reckoning of them, since in such a necessity of theirs, they were not able to helpe themselues.</p>
               <p>Two other stupendious things, are recounted in this matter: one was, that in the country of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> there being a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of country swaynes risen agaynst <hi>S. Martin,</hi> in defence of a Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

one of them drawing out his sword, set vpon him; when the holy man, suddenly laying his cloake aside, offered him his naked necke, nor was that impious fellow any whit slack, to haue giuen the stroake: but lifting vp his arme, in the presence of all, fell flat backwards himselfe, and cryed for peace, and pardon. The other was, that from a like disdayne, another wicked fellow, being min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to kill him, the very sword fell out of his hand, in such wise, as it was neuer seene more. True it is, that he rarely came into such termes, because for the most part, <hi>S. Martyn</hi> with meekenes, and with preaching, would be tempring and persuading the people, in such sort, as themselues vnderstanding the truth once, would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne their owne madnes, &amp; destroying the Idols with their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hands, be conuerted to <hi>Christ.</hi> To which effect of conuersion of soules, <hi>S. Martyn</hi> was wont very industriously to make vse of the great gift he had, in curing the sicke, and deliuering possessed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of euill spirits; as among others, he did heere with a person of great quality, by name <hi>Tetradius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This man, being moued to compassion, for a deere seruant of his, very cruelly oppressed and tormented by the infernall enemy, with great instance intreated <hi>S.

The holy man then, willed him to be brought before him: but the maligne spirit would not endure, to be led from home resisting the same very obstinately, euer with biting, and scrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching. Whereupon <hi>Tetradius,</hi> repayring to the holy <hi>Bishop,</hi> puts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self on his knees to beseech him, he would be pleased to come to the lodging himselfe. And with this occasion, <hi>S. Martyn</hi> began very dexterously to help this soule, with shewing himselfe somewhat backward therein; and with saying, that it was not lawfull for him to enter into the house of a Gentile, and profane man; &amp; could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

There were thither inuited withall, as to a great feast, three principall Lords of the Court, the Consull <hi>Euodius,</hi> and two <hi>Counts,</hi> the one the Brother, the other the vncle to the <hi>Emperour:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these two, was placed the <hi>Priest,</hi> who was <hi>S.

But the great <hi>Prelat,</hi> hauing tasted therof, drank to his <hi>Priest,</hi> giuing to vnderstand therby, in that assembly was none more worthy then he to pledge him; esteeming he had done ill, if eyther the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> himselfe, or his chiefest Fauourits, or neerest to him, had beene preferred by him before that poore Seruant of God.</p>

               <p>THE blessed Man, was now arriued to the 81. yeare, or as others will haue it, to the 87. of his age, when through di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine reuelation, he himselfe knew, that his end approached, and cleerely foretold it to his disciples. But yet for all that, continued he his wonted deuotions and abstinences, and diligently attended to his pastorall office. And because, in those dayes, there fell out a scandalous discord, among the Clerks of a certayne place, which is called <hi>Candacum,</hi> he determined in person to go thither, to quiet them; esteeming he could not more happily end his life, then by leauing all his Churches in good peace and concord. Being gone then thither, and with diuine grace, hauing setled matters, he was now ready to turne backe to his Monastery agayne, when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to feele in himselfe, some notable defect of forces: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gathering his disciples togeather, he told them how his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle was now ready to be dissolued, whence of necessity he must needs leaue them.</p>
               <p>When lo, amidst very dolefull sighes and teares, there was ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed this common voyce amongst them, saying: And why do you leaue vs so, holy Father? To whome do you recommend vs so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consolate, and afflicted? The rauenous wolues will assayle your flocke, and the Shepheard being lost, who is he that can defend vs? We know very well, you desire to go to <hi>Christ,</hi> but your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards are safe inough, and guerdons which differred a while, are not lessened a whit: then take you pitty on vs rather, who remayne in such manifest danger. The Seruant of <hi>Christ,</hi> being mollifyed at these words, could not conteyne himselfe from weeping, but with great affect, turning himselfe to Heauen, sayd: <hi>O Lord,</hi> if I yet be necessary to this people, I fly no labour, thy most holy will be done. Wherein, being as it were put in ballance, he shewed, <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 word">

Wherin, while he labored now with this man, now with that, he was put in mind of the blessed <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> as of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of rare learning, and very able to solue all the knots and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultyes
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:12171:115"/>
occurring in such matters. So as sending a Messenger with diligence for him, he was conducted to <hi>Carthage:</hi> where in a poore lodging, the first thing he attended to (and not without fruite) was to confirme the Catholikes, and to informe the Heretiques of their blindnes, in prouing with liuely and pregnant reasons, that one only substance in persons distinct, was truly to be adored in the most holy <hi>Trinity.</hi> There being afterwards a writing presented vnto him, on the behalfe of the King, full of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>allacyes, &amp; cunning quircks and demands; he, inserting there withall the words of the scripture it selfe, answered from point to point, with so much acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, perspicuity, and breuity, as the King himself, though obstinate in his perfidiousnes, remayned astonished at the doctrine: and the people of <hi>Carthage,</hi> diuulging the said answere, continued more and more, well affected to the Catholique faith.</p>
               <p>After this, the King not contented with the former demaunds, proposed yet some others a new, but without giuing leaue, or scope to <hi>S. Fulgentius,</hi> to answere with commodity, that he might not quote his words, as formerly he did, and giue the world to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the impertinency of them; but constreyned him rather, hauing read the paper, to help himselfe, what he might, with his memory, and to answere out of hand without more adoe. The which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, seeming, as in truth it was, full of iniustice, the holy man for a while, differred to make his reply: but the King imperiously pressing him to it, and attributing the caution to diffidence, least the Arrian Ministers might likewise seeme to do the same, &amp; diuulge with their accustomed vanity, they had stopped his mouth; <hi>Fulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> disposeth himselfe to answere vnto it the best he could, reducing to his mynd, what was but once permitted him to read, &amp; in three little admirable Treatises of the <hi>Incarnation of our Lord</hi> (for the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of the King, was of that subiect) he apparantly shewed, how the same Sonne of God, equall in all and throughout, to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Father, in clothing himselfe with our mortality, tooke truly and really a reasonable soule.</p>

Which things, by how much they brought more honour and esteeme to the seruant of God, so much the more, the Ministers of the Deuill, conspired in one, to aduise the King, not to let the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proceed any further, protesting withall the harbouring of such an aduersary in <hi>Carthage,</hi> would be the ruine of the Arrian religion, and that if he remedyed not the fame in tyme, he would come short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to haue so many Followers, as that with al the forces of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, they could hardly be resisted.</p>
               <p>The King being terrifyed with these, and such like suggestio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, though in a manner against his will, commaunded, without more delay, that <hi>S. Fulgentius</hi> should returne to his former confines, and for auoyding of all popular tumult, he should be embarqued in the night. Whereto he obediently yielded for his part; but the diuine Goodnes, being not willing, with such a departure, the faythfull should seeme to be depriued of the sight &amp; comfort of such a Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deteyned the ship so long, with contrary winds, in the Hauen, as well nigh all the Citty had space to salute him, and to receiue <hi>the most holy Sacrament</hi> at his hands: When behold a faire gale of wind now comming about, and a certaine religious man, one <hi>Ginliatus</hi> by name, among others bewayling his departure, the holy <hi>Bishop</hi> being moued to compassion vpon him, and full of a propheticall spirit, sayd cleerely to him: <hi>Trouble not your selfe my Son, for soone shall this whole persecution cease, and we shall returne to you agayne: but I pray thee, keepe this secret, for I could not choose but discouer it to thee, being moued so with tendernes, and Charity towards thee.</hi> And this <hi>S. Fulgentius</hi> added, for the great care he had to conceale his gifts, and to eschew all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man glory, contenting himselfe the while with the testimony of a good conscience, and with the inward grace affoarded him; so as likely he did not, nor euer would worke Myracles: and if now, &amp; then perhaps he did any, he would still rather attribute the same, to the fayth of another, then his owne vertue.</p>
               <p>But for the most part, whensoeuer he was sought vnto, to pray to our Lord for the sick, and affl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

health of our soules, while thou succourest our corporal necessities, in such sort, as they hinder not the spirituall profit. He was wont to say, that the Gift of miracles serued not to make a man more iust, but to cause him rather to be renowned in the world: A thing tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which auayles, but litle to eternall beatitude, where vertuous and hood men, howbeit obscure and vnknowne, are not hindred awhit from getting into Heauen. Though if we speake of superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall effects, those workes, which others performe in curing of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, seeme vnto me not to be so admirable, as those, which he wrought, in curing of Soules, in conuerting with his fayre exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and good example, so many Heretiques to the Church, and so man sinners vnto pennance.</p>

Wherefore now the more earnestly, he exhorted the <hi>Blessed Father,</hi> to continue still in his good purposes, and to renforce, togeather with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Monks, the vsuall prayers for the quiet of the common wealth. Such demonstrations as these, for that time <hi>Anastasius</hi> shewed being of a better mynd; but (as he was of a nature exceeding vnconstant and mutable) it was not long ere that suffering himselfe <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>With this deliberation, the <hi>Saint</hi> and <hi>Elect</hi> of <hi>God</hi> first retyred himselfe from the concourse of <hi>Rome,</hi> into the castle of <hi>Offida,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out other company, then only of his <hi>Nurse,</hi> that deerely loued him, from whome (as yet) he could not conueniently quit himselfe.

               <p>On those dayes, he being once all alone, was assayled by the Deuill, in forme of a blacke Bird, being called a Moore-hen, which for a good space, did neuer giue ouer from flying in his face, with such importunity, and so neare withall, as he might easely haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken her in his hand, if he had listed. But he chose rather to defend himselfe, with the signe of the holy crosse.

In such wise, as the souldiour of Christ, stood now vpon staggering, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberating, as it were, to returne back into the world agayne; when being sudenly fortifyed with diuine Grace, he reentred into himself agayne, and beholding a bush of sharpe thornes, and stinging net<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>Placidus</hi> on a tyme, being gone to the said Lake for water, while he stoopes with his vessell, fell vnfortunately thereinto, and being snatcht by the streame, in a moment was caryed away, the distance for space of a bowes shot from the land. This in spirit <hi>S. Benet</hi> did behold, being shut vp in his Cell, and calling <hi>Maurus</hi> very sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly vnto him: <hi>Go thy wayes,</hi> said he, <hi>in all hast, for the Child is drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> The good subiect, was accustomed to hold the Superiours becks as Oracles. Wherfore, without other reply, he demaunds only his benediction of him: and hauing taken the same, ranne violently to the danger, and that with so much speed, as that going on the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters dry foote, he tooke <hi>Placidus</hi> by the hayre of his head, not being aware the while of the nature of the way he went on, vntill such tyme, as he had pulled him safe to the land. When returning into himselfe, and reflecting on what was past, his hayre stood an end, and giuing thankes to the highest God, led <hi>Placidus</hi> to the presence of <hi>S. Benet.</hi> Heere arose a noble contention of profound humility betweene the Mayster and disciple; while <hi>S. Benet</hi> ascribes the gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atnes of such a miracle vnto the fayth and promptnes of <hi>Maurus,</hi> and <hi>Maurus</hi> attributes all to the merits and intercession of <hi>S. Benet.</hi> The youth himselfe, in part decides the controuersy, affirming, that in arising aloft, it seemed to him, that he saw the habit of <hi>Father Abbot</hi> ouer him; whereby, he tooke it that he was deliuered by him. But howsoeuer it passed, it is euident, the obedience of <hi>Maurus</hi> was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of eternall memory.</p>

               <p>A secular man, but exceeding pious withall, was wont euery yeare, to go from home, a good way off, to the Monastery; as w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

while it grew somwhat late, the trauayler inuited him very frien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly to eate a bit with him, and to refresh themselues, as well as they might. God forbid, Brother, said he, since my custome is, for to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue fasting vnto <hi>Father Abbot.</hi> With this answere as then, the inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was quiet, but yet after a space agayne, he vrged him afresh, that now it was ful tyme of dynner. But the Man being resolued to keep abstinence, still denyed him againe a second tyme; so as the other was feigne to comply with him.</p>
               <p>But not long after, behold a goodly meadow, with a limpid spring, presents it selfe to them, which opportunely inuited them to recreate themselues; when he that caryed the victuals, sayd: O what water! O what a pasture is this! O what a place to repose in awhile, and to take some repast, rest, and breath of our trauaile! The sunne by this tyme was growne very forward on its way, the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers weary, the sound of the Byrds very sweete to the Eares, the flowers and hearbs, as seeming to flatter the eyes; besides which many fayre pretences fayled not the sensuality, to excuse withall.

But then at the euening, being come into the presence of the Man of God, &amp; crauing his benediction, as he was wont, the <hi>Saint</hi> stucke not very dexterously to vpbrayd him, with what had passed with him on the way, saying. How goes the matter brother? The wicked enemy who spake to thee so, by the meanes of that Trauayler there on the way, neyther at the first, nor second tyme could moue thee away whit, till at last, at the third he brought thee to his bent. The poore man hearing this, and acknowledging his great vnconstancy, casts himselfe at his feere, full of teares, and confusion. A fayre reuelation surely: but yet is this that followes, no lesse prety, and admirable, then it.</p>

Trauayling therefore to <hi>Mount Cassin,</hi> he stayd a little way off, &amp; sent to certify the worthy <hi>Abbet,</hi> that he was
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:12171:136"/>
now come to visit him: and being answered, he might come when he pleased, he caused a Fauourite of his, by name <hi>Rigone,</hi> to be deck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vp with his Princely robes, and commaunded him to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed by his whole Court, and attended by three principall Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, vnto the presence of <hi>S. Benet,</hi> as if it had beene the person of <hi>Totila</hi> himselfe; and gaue good order besides, that no inckling of the fiction, might come to the conuent. <hi>Rigone</hi> trauayling with such Maiesty, and so great a pompe, was hardly arriued at the Cell, but the <hi>Saint,</hi> began a farre off to call vnto him, with a lowd voyce: Lay away, my sonne, put off those things thou wearest so, for they are none of thyne. At which words, the Barbarian, as strucken with thunder, fell suddenly downe to the ground, and feared worse, for his great presumption, in abusing and mocking so great a Man. At which terrour likewise, all fell humbly prostrate before him, &amp; not daring to approach neerer, returned to the King, with pale counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and with faltering speech, related vnto him how sodainely the deceipt was discouered by the Man of God.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Totila</hi> himselfe, went thither in person, with so much submission, and reuerence withall, as that being come in the sight of <hi>S.

Benet,</hi> with his owne hands, went and lifted him vp. And after this, in few words in priuate, he reprehended him shrewdly of his euill manners, and acquainted him besides, with what was like to succeed with him, saying: Thou dost much mischiefe, &amp; many euil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Two whereof, being once goneforth, about some worke of <hi>Charity,</hi> the businesse held them so long, as the poore Monkes were persuaded to eate in the house of a certayne deuout woman. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon returning late to the Monastery, and crauing the wonted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction of the <hi>Venerable Father;</hi> he suddaynely demaunded, where they had dyned, and they answering confidently, in no place; he replyed, why tell you me a lye in this manner? For you did enter into the house of such a woman; and did you not eate of such and such meates? And haue not ech of you drunke so often? They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conuinced with these circumstances, and with ech particular thereof, being full of confusion withall, cast themselues at his feet confessing the fault, and demaunding pardon at his hands. And the good <hi>Father</hi> shewed mercy to them, as knowing they would run no more into the like default.</p>
               <p>There was not farre from the Monastery, a village inhabited by many, conuerted by <hi>S.

One of which, hauing ended his discourse with them, was persuaded through the intreaty of those deuout Women, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a small present of lynnen cloth, at their hands, and so he puts it vp in his bosome; but the Gift cost him full deare, because returning to the Monastery, he had of <hi>S. Benet</hi> a most bitter reprehension for it: for among other things, it was demaunded of him, how crept that iniquity into his breast? when as he halfe besides himselfe, had quite forgot his fault, nor could well tell, wherfore he was so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused; when lo, the holy <hi>Abbot</hi> replyes: Belike then, I was present with thee, when thou receiuedst so that lynnen cloth of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of God, and didst put in thy bosome? With this, at last the Monke came to acknowledge his fault, and with a great deale of contrition, taking it forth of his Cassocke, threw it away to the ground.</p>

               <p>ON a tyme, in the euening, the man of God taking some litle repast, a certayne Monke stood holding him a candle, who
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:12171:137"/>
in the world had beene the Sonne of a certaine <hi>Protectour,</hi> which in those dayes was an Office of great dignity. Now while he way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in that manner vpon him, he was halfe vanquished with a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous temptation of <hi>Pride,</hi> saying within himselfe: Who is this heere, that sitting at the Table, I should not only not sit besides him, but stand holding him the candle, and serue him as a Page? He had hardly giuen place in his soule to these suggestions, but that the <hi>Saint,</hi> with great vehemency of spirit, began to rouse him vp, saying; Make the signe of the Crosse on thy hart, Brother: what is that thou thinkst on? Make the signe of the Crosse I say: and sudenly calling in others, he made them to take the candle out of his hand, and willed him to sit downe at the table himselfe. He being afterwards demaunded of the Monks apart, what was that which he was thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of at that tyme, he ingenuously confessed, the assault of pride which he then had, and the formall words, he was then framing in himselfe. They all wondered the while, and were much astoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed thereat. Nor can it easily be expressed, what a spurre to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection were these kind of discoueryes, and fatherly admonitions of his, vnto them. And thus <hi>S. Benet</hi> of purpose, vsed some acerbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with them, as knowing that medicines for the most, are the more holsome, as they haue more bitternes in them: whereupon the disciples of necessity must needs stand the more on their guard, &amp; become more vigilant vpon their defects, in beholding the may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters eyes still so vpon them, and alwayes intentiue, not onely to what they did, but euen likewise to what they thought.</p>
               <p>But as the diuine <hi>Prelate,</hi> with such oracles as these, vsed to cause a great feare and sollicitude in his subiects: so with others in its turn he would deale as sweetly, and giue as much security and comfort. At such tyme then as Mount <hi>Cassin,</hi> and all the arable Land there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about was oppressed with a great and extraordinary dearth, that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Conuent also, what with the nourishments of those of the howse, as with the almes which were distributed to strangers, was brought to such straits, as there remayned no more, then fiue loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues of bread in the Monastery, &amp; the Granary quite empty.

And to that end, deuout processions being made, with solemne masses, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan from the very foundations a magnificent Temple to <hi>S.

And being inflamed with new feruour of charity, he neuer left crauing of the Highest, at all houres, &amp; somtymes in sackcloth &amp; ashes, the grace to see before his death, all <hi>Hungary</hi> conuerted vnto the fayth, as forseing for certayne, that being so, it should come to be (as it fell out afterwards) a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and strong bul warke for the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> agaynst the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the <hi>Barbarians.</hi>

               <p>Many difficultyes seemed to crosse this pious desire of his, but none greater, then the want of sufficient Cathechists, &amp; Preachers; while the number of them who had come to those parts, in the tyme of <hi>Geisa,</hi> through diuers accidents, was much diminished. Whereupon in imitation of his Father, with ample patents, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

liberall offers, he sent to al the religious Orders of Christendom, to inuite the good, and learned vnto him: In somuch, as many Monkes, and Priests repayred thither, partly moued at so honest a request, and partly also of their proper will. Among which, was one <hi>Astricus</hi> a Benedictin Abbot, called <hi>Anastasius</hi> by another name, with some disciples of his, who in the lower <hi>Hungary,</hi> receyued some wounds for <hi>Christ.</hi> From <hi>Polony,</hi> resorted two famous Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, <hi>Andrew</hi> and <hi>Benet;</hi> whereof the one was famous for miracles, the other honoured with sacred martyrdome.

Nor euer ceased he from the worke vntill such tyme, as he had purged all those lands of their profane rites, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable filth of the Diuells.

               <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> at so noble an Embassage, and ioyfull tydings, felt extraordinary consolation in himselfe, nor euer ceased fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> praysing God for the happy increase of the Catholique Church, especially there hauing beene that yeare likewise, <hi>Polony</hi> vnited thereto, vnder the <hi>Duke Mischa,</hi> and thither come from thence in like manner an Embassage, to acknowledge the chiefe Sea, and to yeild due obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his <hi>Holynes:</hi> wherefore very freely with the generall consent of the sacred Colledge, it pleased his <hi>Holynesse</hi> to giue full satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the petitions of <hi>S.

               <p>In this manner, <hi>Anastasius</hi> with a happy expedition, hauing now obtayned what he would, returned agayne very glad into <hi>Hungary.</hi> In whose approch to <hi>Strigonium</hi> he was met by <hi>S.

It is reported of <hi>S. Stephen,</hi> that there neuer came any pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grime to him, whome he lodged not, and after dismissed with a viatique. He had an extraordinary care of the sicke, he would send them, besides dayly relief, now and then some louing present or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:12171:146"/>
and immediately cured some of those, whome he but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to arise in the name of God. By night, with a pleasing, and cheerfull countenance, he would put himselfe, to wash the feet of most abiect people, and then at last bestow mony vpon them. He would further in the night go alone vnknowne, to visit the Hospitalls of the poore with his full purse.</p>
               <p>And it happened on a tyme, that some of them, eyther through greedines of the present obiect, or for some other vniust occasion, meeting with the pious benefactour, most furious and vngrateful as they were, fell a pulling of his beard; with which fact of theirs notwithstanding he was nothing moued, but passing from thence, to the Church of the <hi>Mother</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> gaue her thankes, with all his hart, for that through her intercession, our <hi>Lord</hi> had vouchsafed him, in some manner, to make him partaker of the most vnworthy outrages, villanyes, and iniuries done vnto him. And from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, more earnestly pursued he to giue large almes, to all sorts of miserable, and calamitous people as well in publique, as in secret, with his owne hands, and by meanes of his familiars, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the blessed <hi>Gunther</hi> of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> an <hi>Hermit.</hi>

               <p>And as often, as this <hi>Gunther</hi> the man of God, did come from his Country, to visit him; <hi>King Stephen</hi> would put all the prouisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; store of the pallace into his hands; when the <hi>Hermit</hi> distributing what he found, vnto widdowes, Orphans, strangers, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars, would soone leaue the Royall Pallace voyd and destitute of all things. Whereat <hi>Saint Stephen</hi> would take very great content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; feeling himselfe by such acts of charity, towards his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour continually enflamed, more and more in the loue of <hi>Christ,</hi> and to the sweet contemplation of inuisible things. And now and then was so highly rauished withall; as that praying once, on a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, in his Pauillion, in the open fields, he was playnely seene with the pauillion it selfe, quite raysed a pretty way from the earth.</p>

With which notwithstanding that rauenons people went not long away so triumphant and proud: Because <hi>S.

               <p>Heerupon the fame of S. <hi>Stephen</hi> now continually increasing, and spreading it selfe through the world; it fell out, that whereas at first, for the instruction and conuersion of <hi>Hungary</hi> there had come thither from diuers parts, very learned and pious men; now for to learne good lawes and laudable customes, began thither to resort many rude and ignorant people, with desire of instruction, &amp; light.

               <p>In veriue of this Order, by the vniuersall Dyet, was a Fast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated of three dayes, with prayers and almes; after which <hi>Ladis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaus,</hi> with much veneration, being accompanied by the Court &amp; people, came first to the Monument of <hi>S.

               <p>Then <hi>Edward,</hi> being depriued of all human succour on earth, and fearing euery houre, his last ruine from others, amidst many troubles, and anguishes, prostrating himselfe most humbly before the diuine presence, prayed in this sort. Behold, <hi>Lord,</hi> how I haue now, no more help in me, and my neerest friends are farre of from me: my friends, and neigbours, are all become my aduersaryes; I haue neyther Father, nor Mother in the world; my Brothers and Nephewes, are betrayd and slayne; the widdow my kinswoman, is become our aduersaryes wife. So as I am left without all stay, &amp; they seeke moreouer, to take away my lyfe. But I <hi>(O Lord)</hi> poore wretch, am left to thee, and thou shalt succour the orphan, as heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore in a meruailous manner, thou hast done to <hi>King Edwin,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironed on euery side. Thou, that madest <hi>S.

               <p>With this Vow, <hi>S. Edward</hi> felt himselfe exceedingly, reuiued, and replenished with no vayne hopes.

               <p>IT was not long, ere the fame of so great prosperity, extended to the Prouinces beyond the Seas.

Edward,</hi> arising from his bed, &amp; still dissembling the matter, quietly demaunded the occasion of so great a heauynes, and hauing heard it:
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:12171:156"/>
Hold thy peace man (said he) perhaps he who hath taken it away had more need thereof, then we: Much good may it do him, the rest I hope will serue for vs. With such quietnes, he passed ouer that act. Whence may be gathered, how well subdued he had his passions, &amp; how farre he was, from all rapine of others goods, that was so pro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt to yeild his owne.</p>
               <p>To which purpose likewise, we may not let this passe; there hauing beene in his <hi>Fathers</hi> tyme, a most grieuous taxation, layd on the people, in respect of an army to be leuyed against the <hi>Danes,</hi> and yet the same exaction still continuing (as it happens) though the warre were ended; <hi>S. Edward</hi> as a good Father, and Pastour of his people, with princely liberality, discharged them thereof, for euer: whereto, besides the greatnes of his mynd, he was likewise moued by seeing playnely, vpon a heape of the same money, an vgly Deuill to sit, and sport himselfe. In such like acts as these of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, equity and bounty, with the edification of all the world would <hi>S. Edward</hi> spend the tyme afforded him for the purchase of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. And yet among these same honourable thoughts, he forgot not a whit, the virginall title, so seriously recommeded to him by <hi>S. Peter</hi> the Apostle: which thing indeed, proued to be so much more violently assaulted by his green yeares, hoat complexion, easy accesse vnto delights, as through the fubtilityes of the enemy, and store of seruants, most prompt to him at euery becke. Which assaults notwithstanding, though grieuous and fastidious, yet most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly being open and manifest, <hi>S.

The battayles which perpetually day and night he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, from the Communalty, and states of the land, were cloaked with honesty, and coloured with the publique good, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently more treacherous, and terrible to him; who shewing infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite care of the vniuersall peace, and security, which greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on the future succession of the <hi>King,</hi> neuer left vrging op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely, and importunely, in tyme and out of season, with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and examples, with prayers and coniurations, and those min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled now and then with some manner of threats, that he, forsooth, hauing pitty on his country, and of the daungers, that hung ouer it through his single life, would be pleased to differ no longer to prouide for progeny, to wit, some fruitfull and honourable ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>Barons.</hi> Among which, with apparence of right intention, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly zeale the <hi>Earle Godwin</hi> shewed himselfe most earnest, being a person, very potent, politique, and ambitious, and who by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of all, had a hand with the tyrant <hi>Canutus,</hi> in the impious murder of <hi>Alfred;</hi> and now with thoughts, wholy pointing to his priuate greatnes, plotted to mary his daughter <hi>Edith</hi> with <hi>Edward,</hi> and that to the notable increase of his estate, to see her Queen. This <hi>Lady,</hi> was not any thing like to the <hi>Father,</hi> as one that feared <hi>God,</hi> being a friend of abstinence, very prompt to read and worke, farre from pratling, &amp; all feminin disports; in summe, a rose sprung from thornes, ordained by God for a faithfull Companion of <hi>S. Edward</hi> in all vertues. This <hi>yong Virgin,</hi> by publique decree, was commended and tendred to the good <hi>Edward,</hi> with the common importunityes and prayers perseuering still; so much more liuely, as the necessities of the Kingdome, and qualityes of the <hi>Spouse,</hi> made a repulse to the more inexcusable. All this now, the <hi>King</hi> knew very wel, but on the one side being resolued, not to manifest; or breake his solid purpose of virginall chastity; &amp; on the other, very hardly able to resist any longer, the petitions and most earnest importunities of his subiects; being put into such streights, and fallen into an agony, he could find no better remedy, then euen the same by him so often tryed, of voluntary pennances, and feruent prayers. So as after many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stings, and other corporall afflictions, which doubtles do serue ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much, to render the <hi>diuine Maiesty</hi> propitious to a man, being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate on the earth, full of humble affect, and firme fayth, he spake to his <hi>Creatour</hi> &amp; <hi>Lord,</hi> in this manner following: <hi>O good Iesu,</hi> by thee the <hi>three Childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> haue been deliuered from the <hi>Chaldean flames</hi> of old. Through thee <hi>Ioseph</hi> leauing his cloake behind, had saued this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: and the constant <hi>Susanna</hi> got the victory of the lewd old Men: and the holy <hi>Iudith</hi> through thy help could not be tempted by <hi>Holofernes.</hi> Behold mee heere, thy seruant, and as I haue beene heertofore, fauoured and beloued of thee, in diuers accidents: So succour mee now also, <hi>O Lord,</hi> in this necessity, and graunt, that in some manner, of imitation of <hi>Mary</hi> thy <hi>Mother,</hi> and <hi>Ioseph</hi> her fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Guardian, such espousalls may be had betweene <hi>Edith,</hi> and <hi>Mee,</hi> that my Chastity may suffer no wrong, or empeschement what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer.

               <p>THis difficulty, now by diuine help, being so passed ouer, there remayned yet another, of some moment; which was the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of his vow (as we haue sayd) heertofore, in his greater trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, to visit personally in <hi>Rome,</hi> the Memory of the <hi>Apostles.</hi> The pious <hi>King,</hi> kept faythfull record still of this so great an obligation, and the care he had of performing the same, did now continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly burne in his breast. Whereupon, as soone as matters seemed to affoard opportunity, he immediately began to make prouision of magnificent and sumptuous gifts, for to offer vp at the holy <hi>Aultars</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> &amp; besides went putting of things in order for the voyage. To this effect, calling the chiefe of the Kingdome into counsayle, he discouered this thought of his vnto them; and reducing to all their memoryes, the vnhappy state, and extreame calamityes of their country, which had brought him to recommend himselfe to the diuine <hi>Clemency,</hi> and to make a vow of pilgrimage to <hi>Rome,</hi> to obteyne more easily the Protection of the <hi>Prince</hi> of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> he demonstrated with many reasons, how abominable, and impious it was, to forget ones duty, and to become vngratefull to him, who had deliuered the whole nation from the hand of most cruell ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes: wherefore, euery one sincerely should propound, what best occurred to him, about the accommodating of things, in such sort as through his absence, might neyther the traffique by sea, nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>merce by land, nor Townes, Castles, or Cityes, nor finally the priuate, or publique affayres come to suffer any hurt: and lastly bids them be of good cheere, affirming, he was most secure that the <hi>Great God,</hi> would both assiste him, in so long a iourney, and conserue his subiects in the peace and abundance, which of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity

               <p>To this sense did <hi>S.

The hire you promised, so contented me at first, and then those heauenly rayes, did so quite bereaue mee of my senses, as I had no thought at all of taking any fish. Go to then, sayd <hi>S. Peter,</hi> cast thy net into the water. And so he did without resistance, when in a moment, he tooke a huge multitude of fishes, and all of one sort, saue one of an vnmeasurable Greatnes; which being drawne to the shore, the <hi>Apostle</hi> sayd: Thou shalt make a present to the <hi>Bishop Mellitus</hi> of this heere, which exceeds so much the other in worth, &amp; bignes. The rest, do thou keep to thy selfe, for thy hyre: &amp; know that as long as thou liuest, thou shalt also haue store of them, &amp; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise thy Successours for a long time after; so that you all take heed, not to fish vpon <hi>Sundayes.</hi> I am <hi>Peter</hi> that speakes so vnto thee, and who in company of other <hi>Citizens</hi> of <hi>Heauen,</hi> haue dedicated this <hi>Church,</hi> as Titular to me, and with this ceremony haue been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to supply the Episcopall rite therein.

               <p>At the end of these words, the <hi>Saint</hi> was seene no more. When the morning being come, and the <hi>Bishop</hi> now in going in processi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to dedicate the <hi>Church;</hi> the Fisherman went to meete him, with that great fish, and declared to him faythfully, what was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to him. <hi>Mellitus</hi> stood wonderfully in suspence heerat, and

the full remission of my sinnes, into the building of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery of Religious, vnto the honour of <hi>God,</hi> and the blessed <hi>Peter</hi> his <hi>Apostle:</hi> as I also, for my part, will notfayle to confirme, &amp; aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the good customes of annuall contributions, which are made to the sayd <hi>S.

               <p>The <hi>Pope,</hi> very easily assented to his suites, so iust; he confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the dispensation, ratifyed the priuiledges, exempted those Monks from the iurisdiction of the Ordinary, and recommended to the <hi>King,</hi> not only the protection of the said place, but euen likewise the defence, and good direction of the <hi>Churches</hi> of the <hi>Iland.</hi> So that all things were done in name of the <hi>Roman Bishop,</hi> &amp; with the asse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bly and counsayle of the <hi>Abbots,</hi> &amp; <hi>Bishops.</hi> In this manner, an end was put to the busynes of the Pilgrimage: &amp; the most deuout <hi>King,</hi> went so perseuering in holy workes, as it pleased the diuine Goodnes, to make him continually more great, and more illustrious then euer, not onely with fame, and worldly honours, but euen also, with the gift of <hi>Curing,</hi> and <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and of other not ordinary miracles.</p>
               <p>He being once at his pallace, hard by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>S.

                  <hi>Irish man</hi> replyed: It is now six times, that I haue gone, in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as you see me heere, to visit the <hi>Aultar</hi> of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> in the <hi>Citty</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> to obteyne health, which yet at last <hi>S.

               <p>
                  <hi>Hugoline</hi> stood a while in doubt, as at a thing that seemed so absurd at first: yet notwithstanding did the message to his <hi>Lord,</hi> who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately gaue thankes to God for the same, and without delay, causing the <hi>Cripple</hi> to come before him, tooke him cheerfully on his back, and began to carry him to the place designed. Thus hung so poore &amp; noysome a Wretch on the shoulders of so great a Monarke, who with botchy hands, and loathsome armes, clung fast to that royall breast, and neck. At this sight, some Courtiers fell a laughing; others with a scornefull and disdaynesull eye, lookt on the <hi>Irish</hi> ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as a Dissembler and Hypocrite; others finally, who would seeme wise, began to tax the simplicity, and folly of the <hi>Princes</hi> but he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this straung burden, had not gone many steps, when sudenly the nerues of the <hi>Cripple,</hi> began to stretch forth themselues, the bones to be setled agayne in their places, the dead flesh to wax warme, and the legs and feete, now vnloosed from the loynes, to returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne to their naturall place. Whereby a great quantity of corrupt humours, gushing out from diuers parts, did very fowly defile the embrodered Robes, wherwith the King was cloathed.

                  <hi>S. Edward</hi> beholds, in vision, the King of <hi>Denmarke</hi> drowned, in comming to inuade <hi>England.</hi> With diuine iustice shewed vpon Earle <hi>Godwyn,</hi> for his periury. <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.</head>
               <p>The hatred of the inhabitants of <hi>Denmarke</hi> (as we haue said) against the <hi>English</hi> continued still. And so much the more increased their rage, as more happy, and glorious were the successes of this good King. In summe, the Enuy augmented so much, as that after long consults, they determined to vse all endeauours to recouer the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session agayne, whence they were so shamefully thrust out. In the meane tyme, <hi>S. Edward</hi> being at <hi>Masse,</hi> on the day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> while the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> was eleuated, shewed a smiling countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, with the eyes attentiue, and fixed more then ordinary. The same, was much noted by the standers by, &amp; the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> being ended, his most familiars were so bold in confidence, as to craue the occasion of such a nouelty: and he with his natiue candour, and humanity confessed what passed, saying thus.</p>
               <p>The Danes had agreed with their King, to returne to their ancient exploits of armes, and to come and disturbe with hostili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that peace &amp; quietnes, which the diuine Goodnes hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:12171:161"/>
to affoard vs: and for that they placed the foundation of the whole enterprise in their owne valour, not regarding the Highest to be the only Maister, and Distributer of victoryes; his diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty hath been pleased, to let them see their vnmeasurable confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Now had they their army in readynes, and being iouiall, and proud of a prosperous gale, were at the point of hoysing sayle; when the King in leauing his long Boate, to board the Admirall, slipping with his foote betweene both the decks, fell downe into the sea, &amp; was drowned without remedy, deliuering his followers at once from a new sinne, and vs from a new daunger. And this happened iust this very morning; and I hope in our Lord my God, and his most sweet Mother their impious designes shall take no effect in my tyme: &amp; this is that which our Sauiour Christ hath cleerely shewed my this day. Great ioy and iubiley was this newes to the hearers; especially when fending some of purpose, to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enformed thereof, they found and reported the fact, the day and houre, to be iust the same, which was told by the King.</p>
               <p>The Seruant of Christ, on a tyme sitting at table, and the <hi>Earle Godwyn</hi> his Father-in-law by him, it happened, that two Sonnes of the sayd <hi>Earle,</hi> yet children, the one <hi>Harold</hi> by name and <hi>Tosto</hi> the other, in playing together, in the presence of the King grew hot (as it happens) into a kind of quarell, &amp; with bitter rancour, their sport was turned to a Duell. <hi>Harold</hi> being some what the more robustious and bold, sets vpon his Brother, and with both hands pulling him by the hayre of his head, ouerthrew him to the ground, &amp; would haue stifled him doubtles, had he not beene suddenly taken forth of his hands. Then <hi>S.

But to me, replyed the <hi>King</hi> in this childish brable of theirs, farre greater things then it, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented. For that, as soone as both shell arriue to mans estate, they shall be taken with blind Enuy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and wicked Ambition: as first with traynes, and hidden frauds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they shall seeme to sport, and be in iest, with one another; but the stronger at last shall preuayle, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And since now we are fallen to speake of <hi>Earle Godwin:</hi> it is sayd of him, that he another tyme being at table with the King, one of the Squires stu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bling with his foote vpon a rub, was ready to fall on his nose, had not the other foot which stood fast vpheld him the while. At which sight, the standers by reflecting, how one foot had helped his fellow; the <hi>Earle</hi> iested. Euen so it is (said he) when a Brother helps a Brother, and one succours the other, in his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test need. Whereupon, replyed the King: And so might my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther likewise haue done for me, had <hi>Godwin</hi> beene so pleased. At these words the <hi>Traitour</hi> was afrayd, and with a sad cheere sayd withall: I see <hi>Syr,</hi> I see very well you suspect me likewise for the death of your Brother, and giue credit to those that falsely terme me a Traytour. But God be the Iudge heerof, who knowes all secrets, and so may this morsell in my hand heer, do me good, as I was far from working any plot eyther agaynst thee, or thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>K. Edward</hi> accepted the condition, and gaue benediction to the meate, which as soone, as it came to the midst of the <hi>Earles</hi> throat, stucke thereso fast, as he was neuer able, withall that he could do, eyther to swallow it downe, or to put it vp agayne, so as the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of respiration, being stopt, his very eyes started forth in fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full manner. Whereupon, as many as were present, were astonished and cleerly acknowledged the heauenly reuenge; when the King sayd to them: <hi>Take away this dogg,</hi> as they did. This wicked man, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many things, committed agaynst the diuine, and humane lawes, was growne at last to be so bold, and abused so much the goodnes of the King, as that to sway and rule alone, through di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers calumnies, he had banished by litle and litle, all the friends &amp; kinsfolks that came from <hi>Normandy</hi> with the King. Nor was <hi>Edward</hi> vnaware thereof; but politiquely proceeding, not to put things into <hi>hurly-burly,</hi> referred, and reserued all to the <hi>Highest,</hi> as knowing certaynely, he would make some demonstration therof in its time, which he foretold more then once, not only to others, but euen to <hi>Godwin</hi> himselfe.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Easter day,</hi> the King sitting likewise at table (where euen amidst the royall Feasts and great assemblies of people, no lesse then when alone, he was wont to take many occasions to enter into God) he recollected himself more strictly then ordinary, &amp; musing vpon the celestiall goods, with an eleuated mynd, acknowledged

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, were so bold, as to demaund, what had happened to him: When <hi>S. Edward</hi> answered.</p>
               <p>The more a man shall seeme to subtract himselfe from transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and externall things, shall the true and essentiall make the more impression in him. Behold how I amidst the precious wines, and cates most delicate, and amidst the lustre of vessels of gold, &amp; siluer, lifting the eyes of my mynd, to my Lord God, haue first felt myselfe to be replenished with spirituall consolation, and then in vnspeakable manner, haue been with the mynd, raysed to the signt of very sad disaduentures, which for these seauen yeares next, with a sudden mutation, shall hang ouer the head of mortalls. Because God, shall not fayle to vsit the iniquityes of the Christian people. He shall deliuer them into the hands, and power of the Infidels, the subiects shall rebell agaynst their Lords: and Kings shall lay traps for Kings, Princes for Princes: and in euery Country, the cruell sword, shall reuenge the iniuries done to the Redeemer. Which things, and others like to these, fell out afterwards, euen iust in the manner, as the King had presaged. And this may suffice vs for his Prophecyes.</p>

               <p>KING <hi>Edward,</hi> was wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfully deuout to all the Ecclesiasticall Sacraments, and particularly to the most holy <hi>Eucharist:</hi> and in this point had, from the diuine Goodnes, among others, one notable fauour. For being at Masse one day in the Monastery of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> before the Aultar of the indiuiduall Trinity, with one <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricus</hi> an Earle (of whome it is said, that he liued very holily in the company of his wife <hi>Gothgina,</hi> and founded many religious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents) the Sauiour of the world appeared to him on the Aultar it self, &amp; stretching forth his right hand, gaue him his heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:12171:163"/>
with the signe of the Crosse, while the King in bowing with his head, was adoring the diuine presence. The sayd Earle <hi>Leofricus</hi> was likewise made partaker of the same apparition, who not knowing what passed in the Kings mynd, was approching to aduertise him thereof; whereof <hi>S. Edward</hi> being aware: Stand still <hi>Leofrick,</hi> said he, stand still: what thou seest, I see also: and then Masse being ended, he added: I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iure thee, <hi>O Earle,</hi> for the Maiesty of him, we haue both seene too day, that while we are in this life, thou speake not a word of this vision, to the end, that eyther throgh popular applause, we may not fall into pride, or through so rare a nouelty, occasion may be giuen of murmuring to those, who belieue no more, then what they can touch or feele with the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</p>
               <p>Among these things, <hi>S. Edward,</hi> being now well stept in yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, and loaden with merits, was certified, that now at last his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward approched, and his certificate was in this manner. He held (next <hi>S. Peter) S. Iohn</hi> Euangelist the beloued Disciple of <hi>Iesus,</hi> in greatest veneration: insomuch, as he neuer denyed any honest pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, that euer was made to him, in the name of <hi>S. Iohn</hi> Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list. When among other times it happened one day his priuy Alme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour being absent, that a certayne Pilgrime, with the sayd inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, most importunely craued an almes of him, and he not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing any thing at hand, pulling off a precious ring from his fingar, very graciously gaue it him. It fell out afterwards, that two En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish men, went in pilgrimage to the holy <hi>Sepulcher,</hi> &amp; hauing cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Seas and now strayed vnawares, out of their way, in that errour they were ouertaken by the darke night, wherein very sad and afflicted, they could find neyther Guide, nor Counsayle, till beyond all hope appeared a venerable old man, who conducting them into the Citty of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> benignely receyued them as ghests into his house, and after a dainety supper, brings them to their lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, with great charity. The morning being come, they both hauing giuen thankes, &amp; ready to take their iourney, the good Host sayd to them.</p>
               <p>Know Brethren, you are like to haue a good voyage, and shall returne safe, and sound againe into your Country: God shal be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious to you, &amp; I for your Kings sake, in all this time, will regard you still. I am <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apostle, that loues your King very tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the excellency of his chastity. You shall carry him backe this
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:12171:163"/>
ring, which he gaue me some dayes since, when I appeared to him in forme of a Pilgrime: and acquaint him that the day of his depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition approches, and six months shall not passe ouer his head, ere I put him into the company <hi>who follow the Lambe, wheresoeuer he goes.</hi> Which said, the Apostle vanished, &amp; they happily arriuing at home gaue faythfull accompt to the King, of what they had heard, and seene. Not was the prediction vayne, because <hi>S. Edward,</hi> very soone after fell into his last sicknes: wherein purposing to edify by all manner of wayes, as many as conuersed with him, now feeling himselfe to decay apace, ordayned his death, should be presently published, though all the kingdome, that his soule, being loosed from prison might haue the suffrages of the faythfull, assoone as might be, and with this, he passed to his most desired Lord, on the 5. of Ianuary 1066. hauing held the scepter 23. yeares, 6. months, and 27. dayes.</p>
               <p>He was bewayled, and buryed with that feeling and concurse of the people, as became such a Ruler and Gouernour. Two tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations haue been made of that vessell of the holy Ghost: the one some 36. yeares after his pappy passage, which vntil the other, was the space of 60. yeares. In both discoueryes, not only those sacred members, but euen also his Princely robe, and habit appeared very whole, and vncorrupted. The first Translation was made, to afford him a more honourable funerall. The other followed, at the tyme of his Canonization, vnder Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the III. When deposing the venerable Reliques, there succeeded so many miracles anew, as would be too long a matter &amp; far from our purpose, to make narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them. Whence we may, with reason hope through the merits, and intercessions of this great Seruant of God, that as so many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler persons, haue obtayned the graces which they craued; euen so that most noble Kingdome, all scandals being taken away, and Heresies destroyed, may one day be reduced, to the vnion of the faythfull, and to the lap of the holy Catholique Church.</p>

His Father then was one <hi>Gondolfus,</hi> who being borne in <hi>Lombardy</hi> of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and comming to liue in the Citty of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta Pratoria,</hi> now called <hi>Aust,</hi> in the confines of <hi>Piemont,</hi> tooke to wife a gentlewoman, whose name was <hi>Ermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berga.</hi> These two consorts, for riches &amp; nobility were equall, but in manners and disposition far vnlike. Because the husband, being giuen to his pleasures, was held to be no good husband for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:12171:165"/>
While the wife on the contrary, being serious in the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the house, and a wise dispenceresse of his goods, gaue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes forth, a most excellent odour of her life vnto her last, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <hi>Gondolfus</hi> aliue; who seeing himselfe vnloosedfrom the bands of Matrimony, being now growne of great yeares, became a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, and dyed in his Monastery.</p>
               <p>Of this couple <hi>S. Anselme</hi> was borne, of whome, as through a certayne presage of his future sanctity, it is reported, in his tender yeares, hauing heard his Mother say, that aboue in Heauen, was but one God only, who ruled and maynteyned the whole Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse, he thought with a childish imagination, that the Heauens were shored vp, and susteyned by the mountaynes, &amp; that from the tops of them, one might reach to the royall pallace of that great Monarke: and as he often had this thought, it happened one night, that he seemed, to mount vp by one of those tops to the forsayd pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and beholds at the foote therof, certaine seruants of the King reaping of corne with much slouth and negligence: Whereat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing scandalized, he determined to accuse them to the Lord himself. Whereupon, ascending to the top, and being admitted to the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, he found the King, with the onely attendance of one Squire and no more, hauing sent away the rest of his family to reape, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then haruest tyme. The child then entring into the hall, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called by the King, approches neere him, and sits him downe at his feete. After which, being pleasantly demanded by him, who he was, and from whence, and wherefore he came: he answered to all without difficulty. And immediately heerupon he caused a loafe of most pure bread to be giuen him, which <hi>S. Anselme</hi> eating in the King his sight, felt meruaylous comfort. Being afterwards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened in the morning, and reducing this vision to memory, the innocent child held it to be a certayne truth, &amp; no fantastical thing; &amp; verily belieued, he had been in Paradise indeed, and had tasted of the bread of our Lord, and so publikely affirmed to his companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</p>
               <p>He went after increasing in yeares, and vertue so, as for his good behauiour, he was beloued of all. Being sent to Schoole, as he was of an excellent wit, in a very short tyme, he profited excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly in learning: &amp; for his choosing of a state of life, he was not yet entred into the 15. yeare of his age, when he began to thinke in what manner he might best obserue the diuine precepts, &amp; saue his soule: and after a long discourse thereupon with himselfe, he came
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:12171:165"/>
at last to resolue, there was nothing more apt for the purpose, then to become a Monke, &amp; to consecrate himselfe foreuer to the diuine Seruice. With this determination, he went his wayes to a certayne Abbot, intreating him to admit him into Religion. But that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late for feare of <hi>Gondolfus,</hi> durst not receyue him. And yet was not the good youth a whit coole therwith in his purpose: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther besought God, he might fall into some grieuous malady, to the end the Abbot by meanes thereof, being moued to pitty, might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him at last.</p>
               <p>The prayers of <hi>S. Anselme,</hi> were more efficacious with God the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with men. Being suddenly sicke then of a dangerous infirmity, he besought the Abbot anew, he would daigne to accomplish his desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, and not suffer him to dye in the world. But he fearing yet the offence aforesayd, was still very stiff in the negatiue: and that not without the diuine Will, since the chast youth was destined to the help of other nations, and for other enterprises of greater glory of Christ, as we shall see anon. He recouered then his perfect health, &amp; for that tyme withall renewed the good purposes; but afterwards what with the heate and feruour of youth, and the riches and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modityes of home, suffering himselfe to be carryed away with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and company keeping; he came wholy, as it were to loose, not only his Vocation, and spirit he had, but euen also the study of letters, wherein he had been so diligent before. One thing only for awhile, deteyned him somewhat, from complying too much with his senses therein, the respect of his deere Mother, whome he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and reuerenced much. But after she was passed from this lyfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then meerly without any tye at all to hold him too, that frayle barke was carryed away into the waues and streames of the world.</p>

               <p>IN his manner went <hi>S.

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:12171:166"/>
yong man could yield vnto him. Insomuch, as seing euery day, the old man to be more bitter to him, and intollerable then other; for feare of some great inconuenience, he determined to leaue his Country, Parents, and friends, as well to deliuer himselfe of so great tribulations and troubles, as to apply himselfe anew, more seriously to learning. Putting himself then in order, and laying his fardell on an Asse, he went towards <hi>Burgundy,</hi> with onely a certaine Clerke his familiar friend in his company: and passing ouer <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senese,</hi> being not much accustomed to the labours of the body, he felt himselfe, so weary of the way, and of climbing vp the hill, and so afflicted withall, as not hauing other sustenance, he began to eate the very snow, insteed of food. Whereat the Clerke being moued to compassion, did presently looke into his sachell to see if there were somwhat there to eate: when besides all expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he found therein a white and sauoury loase of bread, which not in a dreame now as before, but really in effect gaue to <hi>S. Anselme</hi> lyfe, so as he arriued in few dayes to the place designed, very safe and sound, where partly in <hi>Burgundy</hi> it selfe, and partly also in <hi>France,</hi> for about the space of three yeares, he attended to his studyes.</p>
               <p>There liued in those dayes in the Monastery of <hi>Benedictins</hi> at <hi>Bec,</hi> in the country of <hi>Normandy,</hi> one <hi>Lanfranke</hi> an Italian by nation, of the Citty of <hi>Pauia,</hi> a man so famous for knowledg &amp; goodnes, as many youths from diuers parts of the world, repayred to him that were desirous of sound and perfect doctrine. Now <hi>S. Anselme</hi> being moued with the noyse and rumour of such a one; became so enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with desire of knowing <hi>Lanfranke</hi> by sight, and to conuerse with him, as he doubted not a whit, to go himself in hast into that prouince. And was in truth nothing deceyued of his expectation, finding in that Father, so rare gifts of wisedome, as he tooke it for no small happynes to haue him for Mayster, and to be admitted into particular familiarity with him.</p>
               <p>With this occasion the feruent louer of liberall arts, without sparing eyther day or night employed himselfe with singular indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, to enrich his breast with sundry knowledges of high &amp; extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary things, in giuing eare to the doctour, in turning of books, in gathering notes, in framing Epitomes, in rehearsing of thinges heard, and expounding others. In which occupations, while he suffers much paynes and many incommodityes (as it happens) now of cold, and now of heate, now of hunger, and then of sleep; it
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:12171:166"/>
came agayne into his mind, that if he were a Monke, as heertofore he had desire to be, he should not suffer more troubles and paynes, nor do more pennance then now he did, while in a religious state besides, he should not loose the merit of so great labours; whereas in the life he then led, it was more vncertayne what fruite at last, he were like to gather thence. Wherefore in ruminating this, new purposes began to awake in his mynd of seruing God, and wholy renouncing secular designes.</p>
               <p>Truly, it is well knowne that, that fier was as yet very feeble, and the flames ascended but impure, and full of smoake: whereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, consulting with himselfe of the Monastery, he was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre vnto, he sayd within himselfe: If I enter into that of <hi>Cluny,</hi> it is somewhat too strayte, and I shall not be able to endure it: If in that of <hi>Bec,</hi> I shall not there be esteemed awhit, since the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of <hi>Lanfranke</hi> will doubtles obscure my name, and qualityes: Insomuch, as not onely I shall be able to help but few, but shall come also in a certayne manner to loose the tyme and paynes, I haue taken in studyes. It were conuenient therefore, I should seeke a place, where I might both help others, and giue forth some wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy demonstration of my selfe. In these considerations, <hi>S. Anselme</hi> was remayning for some dayes: but then afterwards making his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion thereupon, through diuine grace he was soone aware how they spang from an euill spirit, and from a hart but ill mortifyed, &amp; too much affected to the world. So, as reprehending himselfe for it: And doth this forsooth (sayth he) seeme Monachisme vnto thee, so to wish to be preferred before others, and to be more honoured &amp; reputed then others? No truly: go to then, lay downe thy pride and become a Monke in a Conuent, where, as reason would, for the loue of God, thou beest the last, and the vilest, and most despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of all. And where may this be trow you, but surely in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent of <hi>Bec?</hi> Since there is one to be found, who for his high wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and reputation purchased, is so sufficient for all, as there shall be no need of me at all. Heere then shall be my rest, heere my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, heere God alone shall be my scope, heere his loue shall be my thought, heere the blessed and continuall memory of him, shallbe my happy entertaynement, and pleasant satiety.</p>

               <p>A Midst these deliberations <hi>S.

This newes puts his wits on the racke, not so, as to put himselfe from the will of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his diuine Maiesty, but only made him to doubt, whether it were not, to the greater glory of God, to remayne in the world, &amp; in the workes of Charity himselfe to dispence his goods to the poore. It would sometymes likewise come to his mynd, that to be vnknowne, and to giue himselfe wholy to contemplation, it were expedient to hide himselfe, and to liue in the desart. In this perple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xity, it seemed good to him, not to make any firme resolution ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, without the sound and mature counsayle of some vnderstanding and faythfull person, remembring the Scripture which sayth: <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia fac cum consilio, &amp; post factum non poenitebis.</hi> Wherefore he went to <hi>S. Lanfranke</hi> and simply declared vnto him what passed in his mynd, he craued to be setled and established by him, in what were best to be done to the greater seruice of God. <hi>S.

                  <hi>S.

Being come to the Prelate <hi>Maurilius,</hi> they both togeather proposed the occasion of their iourney vnto him, &amp; the difficulty which <hi>S. Anselme</hi> felt, in choosing a state of life. Whereto without delay, the <hi>Archbishop</hi> answered, that surely the Monasticall Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was the better, and most secure of all. To this answere, gaue <hi>S.

Anselme</hi> was immediately substituted to him in the Priory of <hi>Bec:</hi> which dignity hindred him not awhit, from his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted meditations, but rather continually recollecting himselfe, so much the more, he raysed himselfe to the vnderstanding of most high mysteries, and solued such Theologicall questions, as till that tyme had neuer beene treated before: wherein he was not so much assisted with intense speculation, as with purity of hart, and right intention which he had to expound the purity of diuine scripture, to the common benefit of all, and to defend the verityes of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike fayth agaynst the malignant.</p>
               <p>But among other knots that straytned him most, and held him in suspence, one was, In what manner the Prophets had seene at once both things past, and to come, as they had been present with them; and in what manner, with so much firmnes and resolution, they haue been able to preach and write them. In which passage while one night he was plunged before the houre of Mattins: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold from his bed with his eyes towards the dormitory, and temple he cleerely sees through the wals themselues, the Sacristans and the other Officers, about the Aultar and Quire, to prepare the bookes, to light the candles, and lastly one of them to take the rope, and to ring the bell, and at the pulse, all the Monkes to rise from their beds, to go to the Office. At which reuelation, merueyling not a litle, he came to comprehend, how easy a thing it was to God, to shew the Prophets in spirit the things most remote and distant from them, since to him it was affoarded so to behold them with the eyes of the body, there being so much distance of place, and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny impediments and obstacles betweene. In this manner came <hi>S.
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:12171:168"/>
Anselme</hi> to be cleered of the doubt, which tormented him so much.</p>
               <p>But that which more imports, there was affoarded him from heauen, a discretion of spirits, so iudicious and subtile withall, as he easily diued, and penetrated into the customes and inclinations of ech sort of persons; and arriued sometymes so far, as to know the most hidden secrets of harts, and to discouer moreouer with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary light, the very origens, and seeds, and proceedings of all vertues and vices; and finally to demonstrate with most cleere precepts and examples, in what manner to purchase the one, and eschew the other. To this so great liberality of God, corresponded he with all due thankefullnes and promptnes to serue him, &amp; with the exact custody of himselfe from all that, which might any waies make him vnworthy and vncapable of so high fauours. In fasting he had now got such an habit, that how long so euer he differred his repasts, he neyther felt hunger in expecting, nor tooke any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the meate he eate: And yet did he feed as other men do, as knowing he could not otherwise susteyne himselfe, but did it spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, and so without sensuality, as he not only abhorred al dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes and delicacyes, and gusts of the palate, but seemed (as we sayd) as if in him, the sense of tasting had quite been lost and extinct.</p>
               <p>As for sleep, his holy occupations, and continuall labours gaue him but a very small tyme, answering and assisting euery one, that made their recourse to him for counsayle and direction. In which things the diuine man would be spending, not only the houres of the day, but euen those of the night also: and by night besides, he would attend, partly to amend, and correct bookes, which were dangerously marred, and corrupted; partly in meditating the life of his Redeemer, and contemplating the eternall Beatitude, through desire whereof, he would shed whole fluds of teares, as likewise he would do for his own defects, and through compassion of the sins of his neighbour, togeather with the miseryes of this lyfe, and the eternall losse of soules; insomuch as many nights he would often passe ouer without any sleep at all: and if perhaps he but chanced to shut his eyes, it would be but euen a litle before the houre of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins, when how affectuous he would be in prayers, &amp; vnited with the diuine goodnes, the prayers which he made at the instance of his friends and deuotes, set downe in writing, declare sufficiently.</p>

                  <hi>S. Anselme</hi> was enuyed much for his promotion to the the Priory, especially by one <hi>Osborne</hi> a Monke, who was afterwards reconciled to him; and dying appeares <hi>S. Anselme,</hi> and reuealed his estate vnto him. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.</head>
               <p>AMong all the vertues, and prayses, which are recounted of the holy man, to me none seeme more worthy of consolation, &amp; imitation then the dexterity, &amp; charity which he vsed in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment and instruction of his subiects. To which purpose, we are to vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thus much, that assoone as he ascended to the Priorship, he wanted no few enuyers and persecutours; to whome it seemed an intollerable thing, and very vnworthy, to be subiected so, to the obedience of one, that might well be called a Nouice. Agaynst the peruersnes, &amp; malice of these, <hi>S. Anselme</hi> opposed himselfe with all offices of benignity, that might be, and particularly vnto one, very yong of yeares. by name <hi>Osborne.</hi> This man being endowed with a rare wit, and of great hability, imploying his talents ill, and abhorring the interiour discipline &amp; seruice; had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued an auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion &amp; hateful rancour against the holy Pastor, &amp; stuck not to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise the same, both openly &amp; closely when occasion serued. Which malignity of his, though <hi>S. Anselme</hi> for himselfe, not much regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: yet was he sory so noble a Subiect, of whome otherwise so much fruite might well be expected, should, through diabolicall operation, be so lewdly seduced, and as it were, vtterly lost.</p>
               <p>Now then to reduce him into the righ way, first he sought by all meanes possible, to gayne his good will, and to win him to be confident. For which end he began to make exceeding much of him, to dissemble with his errours, to graunt him whatsoeuer was possible, without the manifest domage of the Order, and finally to omit nothing that might any wayes seeme to tame, and relent that so fierce and vnbridled wit of his. The youth tooke complacence at such deportements of <hi>S. Anselme</hi> towards him, and by little and litle being mollifyed and vanquished with so much humanity; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be affected to him, and to take his fatherly aduises in good part, and euen voluntarily to compose himselfe to all modesty and grauity. Which the wise Rectour perceyuing, he proceeded to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour him more then euer, to preuent his necessityes, not to suffer him to want any thing; and withall to prayse that emprouement and fruite which he noted in him, and sweetly to exhort, &amp; pray
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:12171:169"/>
him withal, continually to passe from good to better. From hence he went vntying him by litle and litle, from his accustomed leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes, and very dexterously reuoked agayne those former indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which heertofore he affoarded him, and by all meanes endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured to reduce him to reason and religious maturity.</p>
               <p>When as afterwards he saw himselfe to be fully possessed of him, continually restreyning him more and more, he fayled not to cut of quite that childishnes, which seemed as yet to remayne in him: and if he had noted him to relapse at any tyme into errours, he would chastize him, not only with words, but with pennances also. Which new seuerity, was supported by <hi>Osborne,</hi> with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble patience, being now assured and most secure of the fatherly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels of <hi>S. Anselme,</hi> and of the amorous affect whence it seemed to proceed. In summe, with holsome and fit remedyes, that youth, who seemed so incorrigible before, came now to be amended and reformed in such manner, as looke what disquietnes and scandall he had giuen before, he now gaue as great example, and edification to all: When as thus cured in his soule, through diuine disposition he fell grieuously sicke.</p>
               <p>Then did the good Pastour, shew no lesse diligence, in helping the exteriour man, then before he had vsed towards the interiour: so as he serued him in person, in supplying him his meate &amp; drinke with his owne hands, &amp; with extreme sollicitude, prouiding him of all things necessary, to rid that subiect of his infirmity, of whom now a good while since, he had promised to himselfe, great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for the diuine seruice, and the good of Religion. But this pious industry of the Seruant of Christ, had not the desired end; since it pleased the diuine Maiesty, to cut of the threed of <hi>Osborns</hi> mortal life. Whereat <hi>S. Anselme</hi> grieuing with most tender affect (as much as Christian vertue suffered) in the houre of his passage, deerly intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, that if it were possible, after his death, he would giue him some tydings of him. The dying man did promise as much, and so expired.</p>
               <p>The body, according to the vse being socked, clothed, &amp; then layd forth on a beer, was carryed into the Church; while the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes sate singing of the wonted psalmes about the same. <hi>S. Anselme</hi> in the meane tyme to make his prayer more attentiue and feruent, retyred himselfe into a place somewhat a part from the others: heer while with teares, and sighs he begs of our Lord, the saluation of
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:12171:169"/>
that soule, being oppressed with sorrow &amp; heauynes and his eyes now shut, he fell into a slumber: and in that repose, beholds in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit certayne venerable persons, dressed vp in white garments, to be entred in the chamber of the deceased, and there to sit downe to iudge him. But not knowing, what sentence they had passed vpon him, &amp; expecting with great anxiety to vnderstand the successe of that iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; behold <hi>Osborn</hi> appeares on a sudden, in face not vnlike to one that returns to himselfe againe, after a traunce, or fit of fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Whereat <hi>S. Anselme</hi> sayd presently to him: What is the matter sonne? How it is with thee now? The other answered: The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Serpent hath risen vp thrice agaynst mee, and thrice hath it fallen vpon his owne head, &amp; the Bear-heards of God haue deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red mee: after which words <hi>S. Anselme</hi> opened his eyes, and <hi>Osborn</hi> vanished.</p>
               <p>This answere the dead man gaue, and <hi>S. Anselme</hi> himselfe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards interpreted the same in this manner: That thrice the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Serpent arose agaynst <hi>Osborne;</hi> because first, he accused him of sinnes committed after Baptisme, before he had been offered vp by his Parents into the Monastery: secondly for those, which he had committed after his entry into the Monastery, and before the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his vowes: in the third place, for those whereinto he had incurred after his vowes, euen to his death. But thrice agayne, was the accuser defeated; because the errours of the world, had been ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled in vertue of the Fayth, and oblation of his Parents, when they presented him deuoutly to the diuine seruice: those of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiciate, were remitted him in the new consecration of himselfe by meanes of his vowes. The faults which he had committed after the vowes, were pardoned him somwhat neere to his passage, by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of confession and pennance: So as the diuell, finding all his quarrels frustrate, being wholy confounded, was quite defeated, since all the instigations and subtilityes he had vsed to make that soule to fall into sinne, had redounded to his owne more grieuous torment, and greater damnation.</p>
               <p>As for the Bear-heards of God, they are (said he) good Angels: for that, as they tame the beares, so do these restrayne the malignant spirits, from the cruelty and impetuosity, wherewith they vse to rush on, to the destruction of soules. After all these things, to shew himselfe a true friend, and father of his <hi>Osborne,</hi> no lesse after his death then before, he sayd euery day a Masse for him, though the whole

yeare following. And if sometymes, he were hindred from cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating at all, he would seeke for some other, to supply the same, promising to do as much for that Priest, when he was requested. Besides which, he did send letters into diuers parts to procure suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages and sacrifices for the same intention, and thereby obtayned a great number of them. Whence it followed, that not onely the deceased party felt (as is verily belieued) eyther opportune refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or accidentall ioy: but euen also the liuing tooke excellent example of so burning and continuall charity of <hi>S.

               <head>A certayne ancient Monke, and great Enemy of <hi>S. Anselme,</hi> at his death, was tormented with a dreadfull vision, which <hi>S. Anselme</hi> driueth away with the signe of the Crosse. And how he gaue himselfe to the trayning vp of Youth. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.</head>
               <p>THere was one very ancient in Religion, who with implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble disdayne neuer ceased to bite and molest the good Father, and by no meanes could neuer endure him, much lesse reuerence &amp; acknowledge him in the place of Christ. Now then, through the iust iudgment of God it happened this miserable wretch fell sicke to death; and one night while all the Monkes were in bed, he began to giue forth very dreadfull cryes, &amp; to seeke as it were, to shun the sight of some horrible figures; became very pale of visage, and full of trembling and great anxiety, and would withall be turning his head on this side, and that side, to hide himselfe. At these noyses, his neyghbours being now awakened, came suddenly in hast to aske what he ayled. You behold mee (sayd he) afflicted and distressed thus within the pawes of two most rauenous wolues, which are now euen ready to strangle me, and demaund you of mee, what I ayle? One of them that was present hearing this, by name <hi>Ricolfus,</hi> who was the Secretary of Conuent, without delay went running
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:12171:170"/>
to <hi>S. Anselme,</hi> who at that tyme was correcting of a booke, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently informed what passed with the sicke man.</p>
               <p>At which newes, the venerable Prior being touched with his accustomed clemency, bad <hi>Ricolfus</hi> returne backe to the sickman: and he in the meane tyme recollecting himselfe a litle, ouertooke him in the Infirmary, and lifting vp his hand, made the signe of the Crosse vpon him, saying: <hi>In nomine Patris, &amp; Filij &amp; Spiritus Sancti.</hi> With which signe, the Wretch was suddenly quiet, and being som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what cheerfull in face, with most in ward affect of the hart, began to giue thankes to the diuine Goodnes: and added withall, that so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraygne signe he had seene to come forth of his mouth, as a fiery lance, which being brandished agaynst those wolues, had so terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them, as made them suddenly to fly away.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>S. Anselme,</hi> sweetly approching to him, dealt with him seriously of matters concerning the saluation of his soule, &amp; brought him to a great compunction, and true confession of all his offences committed agaynst God: and after he had giuen him the absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, told him playnely, he should render vp his spirit, about nine of the clocke: and so indeed it fellout, to the great astonishment of all. From hence forward, <hi>S. Anselme</hi> with a great deale more ease, began to administer the office: in which, as one that sought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote to perfection all those, whome he had vnder his charge; so with particular application, he laboured especially in the help of youth, and alledged this reason for it: That euen as wax, when it is too hard, or too soft, takes not very well the impression vpon it, but if it be well tempered between the hard and soft, it most fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully receyues the print of the Seale; so iust, do we see it to happen in the age of a man.</p>
               <p>Take you one who from his infancy to his old age, hath been alwayes bred vp in the vanityes of the world, and begin to deale with him then of spirituall conceipts, of contemplation, of celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all things, and of such other like discourses, and you shall find him to be not able to conceyue hardly, much lesse to put your aduices in practice, and due execution. Nor is it any wonder, since the wax is hardned, nor hath he spent his yeares in such practises, &amp; hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes had other obiects, and other designes. On the contrary side, take me a child, both tender of yeares, and of conscience, and who cannot as yet discerne the euill from the good, the very same shall happen with this, as with the other, the wax is too soft, and liquid
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:12171:171"/>
for it, it admits no characters, or images. Betwixt these two then, the youth stands in the midst, as temperatly composed of stiff and tender. Do thou endeauour, to instruct such a one, and thou shalt imprint in his mind, what thou wilt. Which thing I noting (sayd <hi>S. Anselme)</hi> do employ my selfe with the more assiduity and follici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, in trayning vp of youth, and do labour from their soules to extirpate all the rootes of vices, and to plant the vertues in place of them: that being purged in this manner and well tempered, they may come to represent more to the lyfe, the true image of a perfect man. And these were the principall motiues of <hi>S. Anselme,</hi> for the education of youth.</p>

art, but shalt shortly be aduanced to a higher degree.</p>
               <p>To these words sayd <hi>S. Anselme:</hi> Then woe to me poore mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable wretch: I am ready to faynt with the present burden, and yet when another more weighty shall be layd vpon me, I may not refuse the same! These sighes of <hi>S. Anselme,</hi> moued not the wise Archbishop a whit, but rather with the same seuerity, he rehearsed to him agayne the same precept, which he had giuen him. In this wise the Seruant of Christ, perceyuing himself to be quite excluded from that which he wished, fayled not at last to conforme his own to the diuine will: and returning home, with new feruour &amp; new purposes gaue wholy himselfe to cherish &amp; increase the more solide vertues in his Monkes. To which effect, knowing very well of what importance was the vnion and communication togeather of the subiects, with the Superiour; he pursued with all the meanes, that well he might, to procure to himselfe the loue of ech one, and that particularly with shewing of true compassion and tendernes to the sick, and indisposed; so as he stucke not to enter often into the Infirmary himselfe, and there not only with sweet countenance and gracious words to comfort the afflicted; but euen also (as we sayd of <hi>Osborne)</hi> to serue them, and prepare them their dyet &amp; food with his owne hands, and with diligence to find out the state of ech one, and that which most would be gust-full, and pleasing to them.</p>
               <p>Through which dealing of his, the bitternes and detractions not only ceased, if there were any yet left, but there followed a thing, which may truly be called, the very health of religion; to wit, a confidence, and a certaine coniunction of the members with the head, and that so strayt, and so great withall, as there was not any, who not suddenly to manifest his secrets, and ech passion, &amp; thought which he had in his breast to the good Priour, as a child would do to his sweetest Mother. With which security, and sweet familiarity would <hi>S.

So as by this meanes, <hi>S. Anselme</hi> came continually to be held in greater grace and reuerence with all men.</p>
               <p>And this good conceypt of theirs, increased so much the more, through a certayne meruayle, which newly happened to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue named <hi>Ricolfus.</hi> This man, while he went one night through

               <p>ON a certayne day, <hi>S.

Which the Man of God perceyuing, without speaking a word ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to any, tooke his leaue, and departed thence, not knowing where to lodge. In the meane time, meeting with one of the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, of his owne Order, he asked him, Whither he went, and were they might harbour and retire themselues that night? The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther answered: Father, we haue a house indeed, not far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence, but there is no refection to be had for you, and your company, saue only bread and cheese.</p>

So did the Monke without any doubt a whit, and calling in hast, a fisherman to him, bad him to throw in his net. Now was it indeed neyther tyme, nor place for such a draught, and therefore the fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man laughed at such a bidden thing, and tooke himselfe to be mockt at by the Monke. But at last, being thereunto co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strayned, as it were though his prayers and persuasions, he resolued to obey; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold agaynst all hope, came forth of the water a Trout of an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth bignes, with another litle fish also: So as that fish was more then inough for <hi>S. Anselme,</hi> and his company.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:12171:172"/>
That other accident differed not much from this which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to him in another house of a deere friend of his, called <hi>Walter Tuel,</hi> who being sory for want of fish, and with words of courtesy excusing himselfe, for not hauing prouision worthy of such a ghest; <hi>S. Anselme</hi> smiled, and replyed: There is now a Sturgeon brought in vnto you, and do you complayne for want of delicacies? As yet <hi>Walter</hi> verily belieued he had but iested with him, and would by no meanes giue any credit to it, when behold, two of his men came &amp; entred into the house with a Sturgeo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the greatest they had seene a long tyme, being found (as they sayd) by the Stepheards vpon the bankes of the riuer of <hi>Alteia.</hi> Whence, though in a base and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall subiect, yet may it well be gathered, that <hi>S. Anselme,</hi> amongst other gifts of heauen, had likewise the spirit of Prophesy.</p>
               <p>About the same tyme, he composed three very subtile Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: one of the <hi>Truth,</hi> another of <hi>Freewill,</hi> the third of the Fall of the <hi>Deuill.</hi> By which treatises, may well appeare, wherein he had tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fixed his mind, though by such considerations and labours, he neuer subtracted himselfe from the care &amp; consolation of his Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes. He wrote also another booke, which he entituled, <hi>The Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marian,</hi> wherein he introduceth a Scholer to dispute with him; he also in that booke goes soluing of many Logicall difficulties. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed thereto a litle Tract, which he called, by the Greeke terme, <hi>Monologion;</hi> for that speaking with himselfe alone, without medling with quoting of the holy Scripture, with meere reasons he proues <hi>There is a God,</hi> and that by no meanes it can be otherwise.</p>
               <p>After this, it came into his mynd, whether with one short ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument only, that same might not be solidly proued, which is so belieued and preached of God, to wit, that he is Eternall, Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable, Omnipotent, Incomprehensible, whole in euery pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, iust, pious, mercifull, true, or rather Truth it selfe, Goodnes, Iustice, and some other attributes, and how all these things are one thing in him. This same proposition now did affoard himso much to do, as partly it tooke away his meate, and sleep; and partly also (for which he felt the greater griefe) held him exceedingly in sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and greatly distracted him in his Psalmody, and in the other diuine Offices: and by how much more violence he vsed thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, so much the more was he troubled with the foresayd question; vntill such tyme as waking one night, it pleased the diuine Mercy to illumine his vnderstanding, and to giue him the knowledge of
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:12171:173"/>
what he desired, with so much clarity, as he felt therewith a great iubiley of hart, and a wonder full sweetnes and consolation of mynd. And supposing he might help others therewith (as he was far from all enuy, or basenes of mynd) he went suddenly about to put the thing in tables of wax (according to the vse of those tymes) and then gaue them in keeping, with great charge, to one of the Monkes.</p>
               <p>Some dayes being now passed ouer, he demaunded the same of the party himselfe, and suddenly they were sought for in the self same place where they had been layd, but could not be found. Wherupon good dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce was vsed to learne out if any of the house had taken them away, but yet could neuer come to haue the least inckling of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>S. Anselme</hi> went about then againe to make others of the same matter, and with especiall recommendation gaue them in charge to another of his Monkes. He hides them in the secretest part of his owne bed: and the next day, beyond all suspition, finds them all to pieces on the ground, and the wax, with the characters, scattered heere &amp; there. He gathers them vp as they were, &amp; brings them to <hi>S. Anselme,</hi> who endeauours the best he could to set the pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces together and fits them at last with much ado, so as they might be read, and so kept them close vnited togeather. And to the end the same might happen no more, he causes them to be transcribed in parchment: and from thence, he drew afterwards a Volume, though litle in bulke, yet great and very admirable in conceipts &amp; speculations, and called it <hi>Prosologion,</hi> wherein he discoursed ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with God, or with himselfe. Which litle Worke, being writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten against, by a learned man, <hi>S. Anselme</hi> seemed to reioyce the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>VVIth all these occupations, as well of gouernment, as also of more grauer studies, the Seruant of God neglected not to write also sundry letters of edification: Of one of which, we

will heere insert a chapter, about the subiect of mutation of place, to the end yt may appeare, how much the same was impugned by this holy man, when it is not done through Obedience, or for some important occasion. He wrote then among other things, some aduises to a certaine Launce-knight, who was newly entred into the Conuent of <hi>Cluny,</hi> of the tenour following.</p>
               <p>Thou art now entred, my dearest, into the lists and warfare of Christ, in which yt behoues thee, not only to resist the open bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayles of the Enemy, but to beware likewise of the subtile traynes, which lye hid vnder the shew of a goood spirit. Because many ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, when the wicked aduersary cannot come to ouerthrow a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, with obiects of manifest sinne, he seekes to ruine and murder him with the poyson of false, but probable and apparent reasons: and so being not able to induce him to the harted of Religion, and the Institute which he hath made choyce of, at least he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours to make the conuersation, and dwelling tedious to him where he abides for the present: and though in some manner, he permit to reteyne yet the Monasticall life; notwithstanding he cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth not by a thousand wayes, to make the simple and foolish to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine, that he knew not what he did, when he tooke then abit in such a place, or vnder such Superiours, or els in such a community, and this to the end, that making the wretch by these meanes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull for the benefit of his Vocation, through the iust iudgment of God, he may not only not go forward, but euen also haue much ado to hold his vocation, and to conserue himselfe in his good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses. Because the mynd being once distracted into melancholy thoughts, eyther of changing the residence, or if this cannot be, at least of reprehending and blaming the foresayd causes of his deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, he hath no power to recollect himselfe, nor to aspire to that terme of vertue, whereto he ought to extend himselfe with all his forces. The cause is, for that the foundation being once vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull to him, he knowes not how to erect any frame of building thereon. Whence it followers, that euen as a yong tree, being often <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

himselfe to fall into tediousnes and disgust; he can neuer come to be well grounded in diuine loue, &amp; consequently being dry and languishing in euery action of religion, he shall finally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine very poore and despoyled of the fruites of good workes: &amp; he seeing himselfe withall, to proceed from euill to worse (yf so he note the same) shall lay all wayes the fault thereof on others, and by this meanes abhorre euery day, more and more, euen those with whom he liueth and conuerseth.</p>
               <p>For which cause, whosoeuer will bee a good Religious man indeed, yt behoues him, that looke into what Monastery he hath been first admitted, and dedicated to the diuine Seruice (if in that place be no manifest daunger to offend the diuine goodnes) with all study and attention he endeauour to establish himselfe there, and there to found himselfe in true Charity, and to beware by any meanes from iudging the manners of the place, whether they be publique or priuate, profitable or vnprofitable, so that openly they stand not against the precepts of God. But rather, reioycing for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing found where to abide in the seruice of Christ, that he put away from himselfe all manner of suggestion, to remoue else whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but with the greatest quiet that may bee, he seeke to attend vnto pious and deuout exercises. And yf peraduenture, yt may seeme to him, that he hath reguard to greater matters, &amp; of more euident profit, then such as are practized in that Conuent there; let him thinke, that perhaps he is deceaued, in preferring things that are equall, before all others; or els in presuming, or promising too much of himselfe: and yf he cannot be brought to leaue of that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, at least let him belieue, he hath not deserued what he desires.</p>
               <p>And if further he note he were deceaued; let him giue many thankes to the diuine clemency, in defending &amp; setting himself free from such an errour, and for that he hath not suffered him, without gayne, or perhaps rather with losse, in prouing another habitation, and some other manner of gouernement, to fall into the blame of leuity, or lack of wit; or els, by imbracing of things too hard, in a very short tyme to become wearied, and fall into the former state, if not a worse. But if he truely desireth a thing more perfect indeed, and more conformable to him, let him make accompt, that for his sinnes, he hath not deserued the same; and let him patiently, suffer the diuine iudgment therein, which neuer denyes any one any thing, vniustly. And in summe, let him shun the offences of
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:12171:174"/>
the diuine Maiesty, through murmur or muttering, but take in good part, and endure all with a sweet and holy peace, least per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuering otherwise, he come to exasperat the iust Iudge, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine excluded from that which as yet he hath not receiued, and loose perhapps, what he holds already, or els to possesse it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any profit at all. But howsoeuer he do feele vpon himselfe, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the mercy or iudgment of God, in any case let him cheereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giue him thanks, and in all, and through all, acknowledge that infinite benignity of his. And since he hath the grace to retire him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, into the Port (whatsoeuer) from the perilous stormes and tempests of the world, let him now auoyd to open in the Port it selfe any entry to the impetuous winds of impatience, and muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; that the Soule abiding in the Lee, or harbour of constancy and meekenes, may remayne firme and intentiue ioyntly, and wholy to the sollicitude of feare, and the gust of diuine Loue; the one of which through caution conserues the hart, the other with sweetnes, euen perfects the Mynd.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant, how this matter would require more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity of writing, or of discourse by word of mouth, to giue you to vnderstand with what subtiltyes in this matter of temptation, the ancient Serpent is wont to make the ignorant Monke to fall into his s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But for that I haue exceeded the breuity already, which an Epistle requires, and that whatsoeuer I haue sayd, or can otherwise say, consistes wholy to conserue this repose, and tranquillity of the Soule; it shall suffice me for this tyme, to haue proposed for your good what succinctly I haue don already. Nor would I haue you for this to imagin, that I hold you for vnquiet or malcontent: but forasmuch, as <hi>Don Orsion</hi> obliged me to giue you some aduertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I know not how to affoard you a better and more holsome one, then for a man to stand on his guard, in this kind of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I know is secretly wont to enter into some Nouices, and quite to ouerthrow them.

Now it chanced that a certayne Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, in great opinion of Sanctity, discoursing with <hi>S. Anselme,</hi> of Monasticall gouernement, among other things, came to speake of these youths, to which purpose, he vsed these words: Tell me I pray, good Father, what we shall do with them, they are so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse and incorrigible; we neuer cease day and night from beating them, and yet still they grow worse and worse. Whereat <hi>S. Anselme,</hi> making a shew of some wonder, answered. You neuer leaue bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them: and when heerafter they come to be elder, what proue they then to be? Euen dolts, sayd the other, and very beasts. Then <hi>S. Anselme:</hi> O how well then, do you bestow the paynes to make beasts of men. And what can we do withall, replyed the Abbot? We seeke by all meanes to constreyn them to their profit, &amp; it boots nothing. Do you forme them, or one, replyed <hi>S. Anselme?</hi>

Do but tell me a little Father Abbot: If you set but a plant in your garden, and bind it vp presently on euery side, so as it can not extend the branches any way: if you go after a yeare to take away the binder from it, how shall you find it? Certaynely with the boughes crooked, intricate, and inuolued. And who then should be in fault thereof, but your selfe, who so immoderatly restrayned the same? Iust so succeeds it with your pupils. They are planted by the oblation of their friends in the Garden of the holy Church to grow vp, and to giue forth good fruits to God. But you, with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, menaces, and stripes, do euen so strayten them, as that the poore wretches haue not a iot of liberty. So as being indiscreetly wrung and opprest, they produce and cherish in themselues, but ill discourses, which in manner of wreathed thornes, so grow &amp; setle in them, as there is after no remedy to be found, or prop to sustaine and hold them vp, &amp; to make them grow out straight agayne. And for that, they find no sparke of loue or pitty in you, nor any ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes or sweetnes towards them, they cannot frame any good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of you, but do rather verily persuade themselues, that all your doings spring from hatred and malignity in you. And hence very miserably proceeds it, that the more they grow in body, so much the more increase they in auersion and iealousies, being alwayes inclined and ready to fall into all sorts of vices; and as in none they find any signes of true charity, so can they not reguard any one, but with an eye a skew, and quite awry.</p>
               <p>But for the loue of God, I would feigne haue you tell me, what is the cause you are so strange &amp; harsh vnto them? For are they not I pray, men, and of the same nature that you are? And would you, if you were in their place, thinke it well to be dealt with, in this wise? but be it, as you say, that you haue no other intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with you in such your rigours, but only to make them good. Did you euer in your life, behold a Gold smyth to frame with blowes and beatings only, any goodly figure of some masse of gold or siluer? I belieue not. What then? For to shape it with his instruments, now beates he it, and presseth it gently, and then with a discreet relieue, ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses he it vp, and frames it as he list. So, if you will seeme to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any good forme of manners into youth, it behooues you to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather with the depressions of pennance to vse some indulgences and helps withall of a fatherly tendernes and loue. To this point, the Abbot. What indulgences, (sayd he) what helps? We continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:12171:176"/>
labour to constreyne them to vertue. And <hi>S. Anselme:</hi> It is well: and so euen bread, and other solid food, are good and holsome to such as are able to disgest the same. But do you try a while to giue it to a sucking child, and you shall see it rather to be choaked, then sed therewith. Wherefore I need not tell it you, it is so cleere. But this I do affirme, that as sickly and strong bodies, haue their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and proportionable food: so the weake and more feeble sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, require a food which is agreable to them, in measure and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. The strong and able are fed, and delighted with the solid and substantiall food, that is, with Patience in tribulations, with breaking of the appetite, with exhibiting the left cheeke to him that strikes them on the right, praying for ones enemyes, with lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their persecutours, and with other the like. But that Soule, which is feeble as yet, in the diuine seruice, had need of tender milke, that is, to be intreated with sweetnes, with mercy, with a cheerefull countenance, with patience full of charity, &amp; with such like carriages. If you would but accommodate your selfe in this manner with your feeble, and able ones, with the grace of God, what in you lyes, you would gayne all. With these words, the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, being finally conuinced and touched withall, began to sigh, and said: We surely, Father, haue erred all this while from the right way, and to vs hath the Sunne of discretion, as yet not risen.

               <p>VPon a tyme, there came to the holy man, a Procuratour of the same <hi>Order,</hi> who bewayled (as it happens now and then) his hard misfortune; for that being touched heertofore by heauenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration, he had left the world to serue God, and now through o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, was constrayned agayne to leaue God, to attend vnto the world. For as much, as the care of conseruing of rents, of following suites, of reuiewing of accompts, and of other such like secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar affayres, did leaue him no tymeat all to recollect the powers &amp; facultyes of his Soule, for contemplation of celestiall things; but put him rather in continuall danger of offending the diuine Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:12171:176"/>
in diuers manners. To which complaint, <hi>S. Anselme</hi> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, with the comparison following: The whole lyfe of man, may be well likened to a water Mill, seated on a swift riuer. Let there be then many millers belonging to this mill, some so neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as to let the meale fall into the water; others, to retayne part, and part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne to let passe away; and some also, that gather vp all, and lay it vp, according as it is fit. Of this number, it is manifest, that he who hath reserued nothing, shall find but litle, he that hath held &amp; saued all, shall be able to maynteyne himselfe more plentifully.</p>
               <p>This Mill, as we sayd, may well be vnderstood this present life: the Meale represents the actions of men. Because, that euen as when the Mill workes, it goes allwayes round, and is euer continually wheeling about in it selfe; so likewise, human actions for the most, returne vnto their stations. As for example: Men plough, men sow, men reape, men grind, they make bread, they eate. Behold the Mill hath fetched a compasse. What then, doth it now stand still? No truly, because it returnes agayne to the foresaid tilling, sowing, reaping, grinding, making of bread, and nourishing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. These things are exercised euery yeare: and like a Mill fetch agayne the same compasse, and turne about. Let vs now take one, that doth all his workes for terren ends, and who in them hath no regard but to transitory things: this man, truly grinds and works indeed; but all the meale, which should be the fruite of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, through the course of secular desires, comes to be drowned, and caried quite away. This man, at the end of his life, when he shall turne back from the Mill to his howse, and that he would fayne feed on something, shall find nothing to eate, because the vehement streame hath caryed away the meale: Whence, wo to the wretch, for he is like to fast eternally.</p>
               <p>Behold another, who looseth not the whole meale altogeather; because now he giues some almes, now hee goes deuoutly to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit Churches, and the sicke, and now he buries the dead, and so doth some other such like workes. But yet when this very person forbeares in nothing to giue himselfe to all sensuality, to be aue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged of iniuries receiued, to take complacence in human prayses, and that he cannot rid himselfe quite of impure and disordinate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, the wretch looseth, ere he is aware, the greater part of the meale. And what shall become of him then in the other life, but euen to receiue rewards, according as he hath behaued himselfe?</p>

Let vs now passe to the third quality of men; and let vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it to be within religious. Suppose, when a Monke who hath made the Vow of Obedience, and what in him lyes, desires not to go forth of the Cloyster for any temporall busynes whatsoe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>, Such a one then, is enioyned by his Superiour to go abroad, to haue care of some possession of the Conuent; the good man excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth himselfe, and prayes he may not be forced therevnto. And yet the Abbot still perseuers, and vrges his going thither. So as the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, being not able to resist, doth what he is commaunded. Behold he comes to the Mill, and needs must he grinde. There arise com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints heere and there, with murmurs and contentions. Heere now the prudent Monke is to looke well to his meale, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it warily into his sack, and not to let it fall into the Curren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> and how this? Let him do nothing out of vanity: Let him not be drawne to any manner of iniustice, for any gayne whatsoeuer. Let him execute Obedience in such manner, as he stifly defend with good reason all the Ecclesiasticall goods; but withall not seeke to increase them by vnlawfull wayes. If he walke in this manner, though he be sometymes enforced not to heare Masse, to breake silence, and other such like obseruances; Yet the vertue of holy Obedience, consummates all these defects, and with his sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Being now come to this passage, the Procuratour demaunded anew: &amp; what then should we thinke of that Religious man, who offers himselfe voluntarily to such businesses, or rather practiseth them, with complements and flatteries? Wherto <hi>S. Anselme</hi> said, such question was not to the purpose of Religious men. To which the other replying, that he allwayes vnderstood it with condition, to wit, that the Monke so desirous of such occupations, should not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter execute any thing without leaue of his Prelate; When <hi>S. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selme</hi> answered: This leaue hath deceiued many such: because that in the matter, which we now treate of, there are two things wholy opposite, Obedience and Disobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: between these two contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes, this leaue stands in the midst. He then, without being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streyned by Obedience to go forth of the Monastery, will yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles

                  </gap>emaines yet lyable to the sinne of disordinate and vnlawfull will and desire. Because that after one hath once left the world in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, he ought not to returne to it agayne, with desire: but yet while he would not performe it without the permission of his Superiour, the Obedience whereto he tyed himselfe, shall seeme <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>S. Anselme</hi> had a vision in sleepe: His fame increased euery where: And through the importunity of the Abbot, was forced to take the whole Charge of the Monastery vpon him. <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.</head>
               <p>IN this manner, went <hi>S. Anselme,</hi> as well with wordes, as with the pen, &amp; that which more imports, with works, inciting all to the contempt of the world, and to the seruice of the eternall God. When through his many labours, being seized with a most grieuous infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, in excesse of mind, he came to haue a Vision, that inflamed him much more to the desire of the eternall beatitude. For that, there seemed a very swift and swelling torrent to be represented to him, whereinto descended all the ordure and filth of the World: Which troubled, stincking, and filthy waters, with a violent force went promiscuously carying away all things with them, which they met with on the way, with all sorts of persons, both men and women, rich and poore. <hi>S. Anselme</hi> being astonished at so foule a spectacle, demaunded of one the company, Of what those mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable wretches liued, and whence they quenched their thirst? And being told they mainteyned themselues with that same water, wherewith they were more precipitously caried away. And how so, answered he? Is there any amongst them, that is not ashamed to swallow vp such filth? Whereto the other answered. Do not you seeme, Sir, to wonder heerat: This same, which you se heere, is the Torrent of the world, wherein sensuall men are so enwrapped, &amp; caryed away: and by and by sayd: Wouldst thou feigne behold,

This place so delightfull to see to, seemed to please <hi>S. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selme</hi> beyond measure: When deliberating with himselfe, to choose the same for his owne habitation, the Guide began to aske him agayne, saying: Hola.

                  </gap> returned to himselfe agayne. By such apparitions he was filled with new light, and with a new feruour of spirit.</p>
               <p>In this meane tyme, the name of <hi>S. Anselme,</hi> ran not only through out all Normandy, but euen likewise through the Countryes of France and Flaunders, yea and passing ouer the Sea, extended it selfe throughout all England, so as from diuers parts many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and learned men, and Souldiours also had recourse to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine man, and dedicated themselues to the seruice of God vnder the custody of so great a Pastour: though he with great prudence tooke heed of perswading them, more to this, then to that Conuent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting himselfe with drawing them onely in generall to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious state, least they entring in without any proper deliberation of theirs to some Monastery, and then finding themselues after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, molested with molestations, temptations, and trauayles, might chance to murmur, and attribute their impatience and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall to his persuasions. Whereupon the Conuent of <hi>Bec,</hi> came short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be amplifyed, both in number of subiects, and in plenty of possessions.</p>
               <p>And the Abbot <hi>Herlwin,</hi> being lastly arriued to extreme old age, and now become decrepit withall, discharged himselfe of all things (touching the gouernement) &amp; layd the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on the shoulders of <hi>S. Anselme;</hi> expressely ordayning that he should be well prouided of horses, &amp; of all other accoutrements for iourneys, whensoeuer his busines required the same, and all should be kept as proper for his person. But he being affrighted with the name of propriety, when he returned from his iourneyes, would giue vp the same in
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:12171:178"/>
common agayne; nor would he euer endure, that for his owne commodity, the others should seeme to suffer in any thing. And that no meruaile, since euen in the world it selfe, he was euer so amiable and courteous to all; as that when he saw his friends to want any thing, he would willingly supply them of his owne, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his ability. For euen at that tyme also, the very light of reason, had dictated to him, that all the riches of the world, were created by the Eternall Father, for the common vtility of men, and that in the law of nature, they belonged no more to one man then another. And much more, after he was offered vp to God in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as a perpetuall Holocaust, stood he allwayes firme and constant in voluntary pouerty. Not wanted he occasions inough to exercise the same; in reguard, that besides the aforesaid priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and particularities, which in vaine the Abbot <hi>Herlwin</hi> had enforced vpon him; there were brought now and then, no small summes of gold and siluer to spend, or keepe to himselfe for his owne commodity and pleasure, which yet the good religious man, would neuer yield to accept of, if they, were not presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Abbot himselfe, for the benefit and vse of the whole community. And if the Benefactour himselfe, as it would happen now and then, replyed, that he had as then no intention to bestow it on the Abbot, or Conuent; he would answere, that he had no need of such things, and that, in that nature, he would receiue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all of any person liuing. With these proceedings of his, he did allwayes yield forth a most sweet odour of himselfe. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce he came to be inuited vnto diuers Abbyes, to make them spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall exhortations, and to resolue their doubts, and to afford them his counsayle, as well in publique a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

After which, perceyuing that he was not able to remoue the setled determination of the Monkes, lamenting and sending forth sighes, he cast himselfe at their feete, beseeching and coniuring them, through the bowels of the diuine mercy, to leaue of such a thought, and not to burden him with such wayght.

And he alwayes according to custome, shewed himselfe most sweet and affable to all, accommodating himselfe to the genius and fashions of euery one; so much, as he would many tymes say, that he who in euery thing, wherein God may not seeme to be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, endeauours to consent to the will of another, comes to merit exceedingly with the diuine Goodnes: that as he accordes with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the present life, so with him in the future, may God and all created things, seeme likewise to accord. But he that dispising the neighbours contentment, will attend but his owne gust only; shal deserue often, with the iust Iudge, that euen as in this world, he would not seeme to conforme himselfe to the will of any; so in the other, shall no man accommodate himselfe to his. Since euen it is sayd by our Sauiour himselfe, that euery one, shall receyue accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the measure he hath proportioned to others.</p>
               <p>The blessed <hi>S. Anselme</hi> now being moued with such like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as we haue sayd, did shun by all meanes to be troublesome &amp; grieuous to any: howbeyt, now and then, he was constrayned therefore to remit somwhat of the monasticall seuerity &amp; discipline that he vsed otherwise, reputing it to redound to the greater glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and seruice of God, to condescend rather a litle now and then, with holy equity, to such Soules as he was to help, then by standing too much vpon rigour, to estrange, and alienate them from his speach and conuersation. Whence it followed, through the great affection, that all seemed to beare him, they came at last with a very good will to receiue very holesome and spirituall aduertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from him: Which in truth haue neuer yet beene put in print,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:12171:180"/>
nor alwayes giuen in the same manner, but proportionable to the qualityes and estate of the hearers.</p>
               <p>To the Monkes, aboue all things he would giue to vnderstand they should not seeme to neglect the least faults and trangressions of the Institute. And was wont to confirme the same, with a simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of a Viuary, or Fish-trough, because that euen as when the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, or chinks are not kept well stopt within them, the water by and litle goes running forth, &amp; the fish doth euen perish the while: So in religious houses, when there is no heed taken of lighter faults, by litle and litle, is spirit togeather with obseruance lost.</p>
               <p>He taught the Clearkes, how they were to maintayne the profession which euen by name they made, of hauing God only for inheritance, portion &amp; lot, and aduised them to stand allwayes vpon their guard, least through negligence or tepidity, insteed of possessing God, they come to inherite the Deuill. To the maryed in like sort, he would giue aduertisements, very full of prudence and sanctity.</p>
               <p>And in this doctrine of his, the diuine man proceeded not after the manner of the Maisters, and deep Deuines of the world, who beleiue they cannot seeme to maintayne their degree and dignity if they do not still propose very high and sublime conceipts, and not so easy to be apprehended of the vulgar: But <hi>S. Anselme,</hi> quite contrary to such, by reducing the highest points to the capacity of the meaner vnderstandings, and vnfolding the obscure and intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate passages, and declaring them by images and materiall exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples (being a thing very proper to true and absolute Wisedome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) and confirming them moreouer with potent and manifest reasons; would seeme efficatiously to engrosse them in the breast and heart, so as euery one heard him with great cheerefullnes, and recurred to him in their doubts, with the greatest confidence that might be. Nor was there in England a personage at that tyme of importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that held it not a great misfortune to haue had no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to heare, honour, and serue such a man. Yea euen King <hi>William</hi> himselfe, who had, conquered that Nation by force of armes, and was commonly held to be fierce and cruell, shewed himselfe to <hi>S.

               <p>FRom this tyme forwards, <hi>S. Anselme</hi> was much conuersant in <hi>England,</hi> and according to the occurrences that happened, he made frequent iourneys thither. And among other tymes that he went into those parts, one was, after the death of the said King <hi>William,</hi> to whom his Sonne succeeded of the same name, being a person very ill enclined, and who from a King became a Tyrant: and among other iniquityes of his, against all Iustice, he doubted not to pollute his impions hands, with the oppression of the Clergy and Religious, &amp; with the vsurpation of the goods of the Church. Whereupon it seemed good to the Earle of <hi>Chester,</hi> and to other principall Lords of the kingdome, to giue him a Christian admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment by the meanes of one of so great authority, as <hi>S.

               <p>
                  <hi>S. Anselme</hi> then, being so earnestly inuited and intreated by this Man, and many others, with the greatest instance that might be; passed ouer agayne vnto <hi>Canterbury,</hi> where a litle before was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased <hi>S. Lanfrank</hi> the Arch-Bishop, and where the Clergy and people, were in great care and desire, to supply the vacancy of that Seate, with the election of some worthy and sufficient Prelate. So as now at the appearing of <hi>S. Anselme,</hi> began to arise a generall whisper in the whole Citty, that a new Arch-Bishop was come already, and how they ought not to thinke of any other then of him. Which the humble Seruant of Christ perceiuing, immediately departed from thence, nor could he be induced by the prayers or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties of any, so much as to celebrate there on the Feast the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the <hi>Natiuity of the most blessed Virgin.</hi> From hence, according to the necessity of the Churches, and the request of the Peeres, he refused not to go to the Court, where met with much reuerence by all the <hi>Barons,</hi> &amp; the King himselfe likewise, with cheerfull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, came to receiue him, euen to the gate of the Pallace; and after most deere kisses, and louing imbraces, taking him by the right hand, he conducted him into a roome thereby. Where sitting
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:12171:181"/>
downe, and some words of courtesy passing betweene them, <hi>S. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selme</hi> shewed his desire to haue priuate audience with him: so as the standers by, went immediatly forth, when he without touching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whit the matters appertayning to his Monastery, for which it was thought, he had principally come to Court, with Christian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, be gan to discouer to the King, the sinister fame, that went of him; nor stuck he, to specify vnto him many particulars, that he might the more easily come to amend them.</p>
               <p>The discourse being ended, he went his wayes, to seeke out the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Chester,</hi> &amp; was enforced to remayne there for some dayes. In the meane while, the King fell grieuously sicke, &amp; fearing death was put in mynd by his followers, assoone as possible, to prouide for the principall Church of the Kingdome, being then without a Pastour, which was that of the aforesaid <hi>Canterbury.</hi> And now this counsayle seeming good to the King, he nominated the Abbot <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selm,</hi> and no other, for the same administration. The which declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was with admirable applause, receyued of all. The Abbot on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, at the newes thereof, was strooke euen dead, as it were; but then gathering his forces to him agayne, he endeauours by all meanes possible to resist, but not being able to preuayle, agaynst the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate consent of the King, and of the whole Clergy, and people, he was snatched vp, and carryed into the Cathedrall Church, and placed in the Throne with much solémnity From thence, he was straight conducted to <hi>Winchester,</hi> and lodged in the suburbs of the Citty there: where while he remaynes in the company of <hi>Gondol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> and of a certayne principall Monke, by name <hi>Baldwin:</hi> behold one night was a great fire enkindled in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-houses, which with fury went consuming whatsoeuer it met with in the way. It now approched to the house very neere vnto <hi>S. Anselmes</hi> Iune; when some familiar friends of the Hostesse or Mistres of the house, seeing so litle remedy agaynst the fire, began to carry away from thence the houshold-stuffe, into some safer place. But the woman, being full of fayth, forbad the same; very confidently affirming, there was no such cause of feare, while she had the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop <hi>S. Anselme</hi> in her house. At which so generous words of hers, <hi>Baldwin</hi> being moued, intreated the holy Father, not to deny his succour to the deuout Matron: but he, with accustomed modesty &amp; humility, answered: what should I helpe her? &amp; wherein I pray! Go you but forth then, the other replyed, and make the signe of the
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:12171:181"/>
holy Crosse agaynst the fire: and who knowes, whether the diuine Clemency may not happily extinguish it by that meanes? When <hi>S. Anselme</hi> replyed agayne. What say you, by my meanes? You know not what you say. And yet neuertheles, for feare of the imminent danger, he went forth with the others; and in the sight of those furious flames, was constrayned by the Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> and <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwin,</hi> to oppose the holsome signe of the Crosse there to. A strange thing, he had no sooner lifted vp his hand, but (as likewise it is read of <hi>S. Martin)</hi> that flaming and impetuous floud of fire, retiring into it selfe, made a stop in its course: and the flames being extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished on a sudden, left the buildings halfe burnt, so farre as it had gone.</p>

               <p>AFter all these things, <hi>S. Anselme</hi> did seeke very dexterously to put off from his shoulders, that new burthen of the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprique: and to that end had differred till then, the acceptation thereof, and his full consent thereunto. But so great were the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, and coniurations made of persons of ech quality; togeather with the scruple of <hi>Obedience</hi> thereunto added, which was imposed vpon him heertofore by the Archbishop of <hi>Roan,</hi> as that in fine a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent was violently extorted from him. And so was the blessed Man, with great ioy and solemnity, consecrated by all the Bishops of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> in the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> This consecration of his, was celebrated vpon the 4. of December, on the feast of the glorious <hi>S.

of his expectation; since <hi>S. Anselme,</hi> was not willing at all to aggrieue his subiects with any exactions &amp; loanes, to satisfy the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate appetites of the King.</p>
               <p>So that perceyuing him now to be angry with him, he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from Court, and retyred himselfe to a certayne Village of his called <hi>Bregge,</hi> to finish, and dedicate there a Church for that parish, which by the death of <hi>S. Lanfranke</hi> his Predecessour was yet imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. In which ceremony, succeeded a notable accident: which was, that a certayne Clerke, but ill disposed, comming from <hi>London,</hi> vnder shew of assisting at the sacred office, had thrust himsele into that troupe: where casting his eye on the vessell of holy Oyle, but ill lookt to as it seemed; he began to lay his sacrilegious ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and so with silence went secretly his wayes, towards his home agayne. He was now gone a pretty way, as he thought, when co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his opinion, he found himselfe still in the same assembly, &amp; in the selfe same place from whence he had fled; whereat wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring not a litle, he puts himselfe on the way againe: &amp; behold with in a while, finds himselfe still in the Church of <hi>Bregge:</hi> and so went turning his backe to it agayne and agayne, vntill such tyme as the people being aware of those erring and wandering steps of his, cast their eyes on the Clerke; and at the same instant were the Deacons aduised, that the vessell of Chrisme was not to be found, for which there arising a great cry, vpon good aduise, and discreet coniecture, the foresayd Clerke was immediately apprehended, and the vessell being found about him vnder his cloake, with menaces and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, he was brought to <hi>S. Anselme,</hi> who being moued with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion towards the wretch, with cheerfull countenance reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him Fatherly for it, and ordayned, he should be let go forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with without punishment; and immediately the Man went dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly home to his house.</p>
               <p>This Dedication being finished, <hi>S. Anselme</hi> was very suddenly recalled agayne to the Court, of purpose, to giue his benediction to the King before he crossed the seas. He went then presently thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and for that, the wind in those dayes was very contrary vnto him, he thought it his duty in the meane tyme, with all care and diligence, to admonish <hi>K. William</hi> agayne, of the great disorders &amp; many abuses introduced into the kingdome, and to exhort him to relieue the afflicted Churches, and to help to reforme the same. He did it then in the best manner he could: but the King, being now
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:12171:183"/>
troubled already, and wholy vncapable of good counsayle, not only slighted the man of God, with the Fatherly correction he gaue him: but euen also, with great disdayne and contempt did banish him his presence. Whereupon, some wicked and insolent men present, tooke new courage, and boldnes agayne to offer wrongs and iniuries to Ecclesiasticall persons and their goods, bearing but li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>le respect to the dignity and merits of <hi>S. Anselme</hi> himselfe: who being much more seen and expert in the knowledge of spirits, then in the manage of temporall affayres, partly suffered himselfe to be deceyued, not being able to persuade himselfe, that any one for tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitory things, would willingly loose the eternall; and partly also, was enforced to yield, hauing (as we sayd) the King for aduersary, and his grieuous enemy.</p>
               <p>So as now being wholy anxious, he neuer ceased to bemoane himselfe for the quiet and peace of a religious state; nor found he any comfort, but when he could now &amp; then, retire himselfe from company, into Cloysters. Nor would he neither within the Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique, nor yet without, euer liue without the company &amp; assistance of some vertuous and approued Monkes, to his exceeding gust, and to the great edification of as many as knew him. Besides which, he fayled not to steale some tyme for meere contemplation, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy the troubles of the Catholique Church, by meanes of his most learned writings. Among which, is that worke of his, most worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renowned, which he wrote in the midst of so great afflictions vpon the subiect of the <hi>Incarnation of the Eternall Word:</hi> wherewith, the errour of the Greeks, remayned discouered and conuinced, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so audacious, as to deny the Procession of the holy Ghost from the second person of the Blessed Trinity.</p>
               <p>Not only thus in his Cell, and studies, but euen likewise at ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when they had giuen ouer reading, as a most excellent Deuine, he would solue very intricate knots, &amp; expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d difficult passages of the sacred Scripture. He likewise feared so much euery offence, how light soeuer; as he often affirmed, with sincerity, that if he had on the one side, the horrour of sinne before his eyes, and the paynes of Hell on the other, with the necessity of being drenched or engul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this, or that; he would doubtles make choyce, rather of the infernall paynes, then of the offence of God; and sooner accept of Hell, as pure and innocent, then the heauenly mansion being polluted with sinne.</p>

               <p>THe Seruant of Christ, was wont with the gift which he had of knowledge, to gather spirituall &amp; fruitfull conceipts from the things which daily occurred: as once certaine Seruants of his, had a course at a Hare, who after she had diuers wayes, very nimbly tryed to escape from them, by secret instinct, came at last to squat euen vnder <hi>S. Anselmes</hi> horse, who suddenly thereupon made a stop, so as the dogs, not daring to set vpon her, stood aloofe, baying at her, expecting her starting agayne. At which sight, the company laughing, and making much sport, <hi>S. Anselme</hi> fell a weeping: You laugh my Maysters (sayd he) but this poore little beast heere laughs not at all, or finds any sport. Her enemies encompasse her round about, and she with the agonies of death, recurres to vs for succour. The same indeed succeeds very often to the reasonable soule of man, which no sooner yssues from the body, but the hunters (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant spirits) pursuing her as long as she liueth in flesh, by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers turnings, &amp; crooked pathes of vices and iniquityes, euen to the article of death, do then cruelly stand ready to snatch her away, and to cast her headlong to eternall perdition, laughing &amp; making great sport thereat; whiles the poore wretch lyes depriued and despoyled of all helps. And after these words, <hi>S. Anselme</hi> spurd on his horse, and commaunded them not to molest the poore creature; when by &amp; by hauing escaped the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, she skippes againe into the meadowes &amp; woodes from whence she had fled.</p>
               <p>Another day, the holy Father seeing a boy in the stretes, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in his hand, a certaine little Bird, fast tyed by the feete with a long thrid, taking much pleasure to let the thrid go and come now and then, and in the midst of its flight to pull it backe on a sudden agayne, and let it fall often to the ground. Whereat <hi>S. Anselme</hi> tooke compassion on the poore creature, and much desired to see the bird at liberty; when behold on a sudden the thrid brake, and the bird flew away, and the boy cryed. <hi>S. Anselme</hi> reioyced the while, &amp; cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to his companions: haue you (sayd he) taken heed to the sport of the litle Boy heere? Whereto the others answering yea, he then replyed: And now such manner of sport for all the world, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient aduersary makes euery day with many sinners; he holds them
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:12171:184"/>
so entangled in his snares, and playing at his pleasure, precipitates them now into this, and then into that vice. As for example, some be giuen to auarice, or els carnallity, or to some other such like mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series: To these will it happen now and then, that being touched with pennance and compunction, they make reflexion vpon the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill life which formerly they haue lead, for which they are moued to teares, &amp; for that time make good purposes to amend themselues. And now it seemes verily to them, they are loose already, &amp; at full liberty: but yet with the thrid, or lyne of euill custome, in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry loose and iumpe, as it were of their flying away, they are sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pulled backe agayne by the Deuill, and made to fall as before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the same sinnes. And this thing happens very often, nor do they euer come to get forth of so abominable a seruitude, till with some great violence of theirs, &amp; with the efficacious help of diuine grace, the same lyne comes once to be broken asunder. With such holy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuments as these, the holy man, dayly excited himselfe, and others, to the custody of the hart, and purchase of vertues.</p>
               <p>But to returne from whence we haue digressed. <hi>King William,</hi> after he had vnworthily banished from his presence the venerable man, so that <hi>S. Anselme,</hi> seeing now all things to passe continually from ill to worse, without hope of any present remedy, through the occasion of obieyning his Episcopall Pall, resolued to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; to recurre vnto the Pope for help and counsaile, who in those daies was <hi>Vrban</hi> the second; for this end he went to demaund licence of the King, and after many repulses, affronts, and iniuries receyued at his hands; did finally obteine it, with condition neuer to put foote into <hi>England</hi> more. Heerupon, with great feeling and teares, taking his leaue, first of the Monkes, and then of the Clergy, and people, he went to <hi>Douer,</hi> and there embarqued himselfe for <hi>France:</hi> but in the midst of his course, behold a contrary wind arose, in such sort as the mariners began to protest, that vnles he would needs be drowned, of necessity they must be fayne to turne backe agayne from whence they came. This newes, did much afflict the good Archbishop, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing him to say with sighs: Since then, it pleaseth the Almighty God of his iust iudgments to send me againe backe to my passed mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series, rather then to let me go whither I had intended to arriue, let his diuine Maiesty do with me what he thinkes best, &amp; gouerne and dispose of euery thing, according to his good pleasure. With these words growing te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, his eyes were all bathed in teares; when
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:12171:185"/>
through diuine Clemency, the wind suddenly began to come about so as with a prosperous gale the ship arriued in <hi>France</hi> at a place cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Whitsand:</hi> where they landing, was discouered another wonder, to wit, a leake in the barke of two foote broad, which through the merits of the holy man, amidst so great a tempest, and storme, had receaued no water.</p>
               <p>As soone as it was known in Court, that <hi>S. Anselme</hi> was now on the other side, King <hi>William</hi> with impious boldnes, caused his possessions and goods to be seized vpon in his name: he cut of all the Acts &amp; decrees by him made in the same Dioc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In the meane tyme, the Seruant of Christ being arriued at <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> there rested himselfe a while, &amp; from thence passed safe to <hi>Rome,</hi> being euery where receyued of al, with much honour &amp; reuerence; and especially of the Pope himselfe, causing chambers to be proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him in his owne Pallace; and admitting him to audience, and kissing of the feet tooke him vp, and deerely imbraced him; &amp; in the presence of all the Prelates, spake so much good of him, as the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man being confounded thereat, had not the hart to lift vp his eyes from the ground, much lesse to endure such ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of discourse. Wherefore with good opportunity he declared the state of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Churches, and particularly that of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> when the Pope with gracious words promised, to take the businesse to hart, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for the same in due tyme.</p>

Now the said Guardian co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued a great hope
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:12171:185"/>
that though the sanctity of <hi>S. Anselme</hi> some remedy would be easily obtained from Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for so great a difficulty. And therupon he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to dig a well in his owne house, howbeit the place being craggy and stony of its own nature, was very vnapt for the purpose: but yet before he would put hand to the worke, he prayed the Man of God to affoard his benediction to the enterprize, &amp; to be the first to open the Earth with his holy hands. Whose request <hi>S.

When it was not long, ere there sprung vp a most limpid and excellent water from the stony soyle, which being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed within a pit of a small depth, there followed after a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dance from thence, inough to supply, not onely the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessityes of all those parts thereabout; but euen likewise to cure the diseases and infirmities of many, who had faithfully recourse to that succour: which thing, being once diuulged, gaue no small credit of more then human power to the <hi>B.

               </p>
               <p>Heere now remayned the Seruant of God, a pretty while, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting himselfe, and greatly attentiue to diuine contemplation and serious studies, to his most extraordinary delight; as seeming to him in a certayne manner, he was now returned to his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted monasticall life againe: where (among other things) he finished a Booke intituled: <hi>Cur Deus homo,</hi> which heertofore he had begun in <hi>England.</hi> In those dayes was <hi>Capua</hi> besieged by <hi>Roger</hi> Duke of <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glia;</hi> who moued with the fame and neighbour-hood of <hi>S. Anselme,</hi> sent to inuite &amp; pray him to vouchsafe to come vnto him. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Man went presently, and with his presence, humility, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, so edifyed the Duke, and gayned so the minds of the whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my vnto him, that whersoeuer he shewed himself, he was blessed &amp; glorifyed of euery one: in so much as many <hi>Saracens,</hi> being moued with his good example, &amp; the good entertainement he gaue them, were euen ready to be conuerted to the holy Fayth: and had beene so indeed, if through diabolicall suggestion, they had not been hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, by a Count of <hi>Sicily,</hi> who at the instance of Duke <hi>Roger,</hi> had trained, and conducted them to that Seruice.</p>

                  <hi>SAint Anselme</hi> being arriued now, at <hi>Lyons,</hi> while he attended to his wonted exercises of vertue, and assisting the Archbishop, &amp; that Diocesse; behold two Monks from <hi>England</hi> with tydings, that <hi>K. William</hi> vpon the second of August, being a hunting, was shot through the hart with an arrow, and had presently giuen vp the ghost. Whereat <hi>S. Anselme</hi> was very sory, &amp; most bitterly lamenting affirmed, he would willingly haue giuen vp his owne life, to haue deliuered his King from so sudden, and dreadfull an end. And a litle after, arriued diuers Posts to <hi>S. Anselme,</hi> with letters from <hi>K. Henry</hi> his Successour and the Nobility of <hi>England,</hi> both Ecclesiasticall, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, intreating him to returne backe againe with all possible di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, for that the whole Kingdome expected him, with excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:12171:186"/>
desire, and that all publique businesses were differred, and put off vntill his comming.</p>
               <p>Whereupon <hi>S. Anselme</hi> without delay, tooke his iourney towards <hi>Normandy,</hi> and crossing the Seas, the first thing he did, he declared to the new King, in plaine termes, what had lately been determined in the sacred Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel of <hi>Rome</hi> in the matter of inuestitures of Bishops. Whereat <hi>K. Henry</hi> being greatly troubled made instance to <hi>S. Anselme</hi> that for reuocation of such a decree, he would returne agayne vnto the Pope, called <hi>Paschalis,</hi> being newly elected in place of <hi>Vrban</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deceased: to which request <hi>S. Anselme</hi> made answere playnly, that it was not to be sued for, or possibly procured by any meanes; &amp; yet notwithstanding <hi>K Henry</hi> vrging him, that at least for his satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he would leade with him, another Embassadour thither, whome for that purpose he determined to send to his Holynes, <hi>S. Anselme</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, and being receiued by the Pope, and the whole Court with great honour, his companion the Kings Embassadour after he had laboured in vayne for that which his Lord pretended, returned into <hi>England</hi> without effect, and <hi>S. Anselme</hi> remained in <hi>France.</hi> for that he heard <hi>K. Henry</hi> was exceedingly displeased for the ill successe of his affayres in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and had impioussy seized vpon the Archbishoprike of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> &amp; despoiled <hi>S. Anselme</hi> of all his goods.</p>
               <p>Howbeit after a while the same <hi>K. Henry,</hi> being touched with the feare of God, and true pennance, restored <hi>S. Anselme</hi> into the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of the sayd Church, and very honorably receiued him againe into peace &amp; grace. Which conuersion of his, how gratefull it was to the diuine M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>iesty, did soone appeare by a glorious victory, which he got agaynst his Brother Duke <hi>Robert,</hi> with other persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, who had reuolted from him; through which victory <hi>K. Henry</hi> did remaine absolute Lord of <hi>Normandy.</hi> And in signe of gratitude, caused a Parlament to be called at <hi>London,</hi> in which, to the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary consolation of <hi>S. Anselme</hi> there present, and of all good men, he renounced the custome of his Predecessours, concerning the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uestiture of Churches, leauing the free disposition therof to the Pope and his Delegats, shewing him selfe heerin particularly, to be a true and obedient child of the holy Apostolique Sea.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>S. Anselme,</hi> waxing dayly more, and more grieued with old age, and diuers infirmityes, especially of the stomacke, came to such weakenes, as that not being able to celebrate Masse, made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to he carryed euery day to the Church to heare the same, and in
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:12171:187"/>
short tyme the malady increased so much, as it cleerely appeared, there was litle hope of his life. His benediction then was required by the Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> for all that were present, as also for the King and Queene themselues, with their children, and the whole Kingdome besides: and he hauing giuen it, with much deuotion most sweetly bowed downe his head, and one of his familiars, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Text of the Ghospell, began to recite the Passion of our Lord, and comming to those wordes: <hi>Vos estis, qui permansistis me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum in tentationibus meis, &amp; ego dispono vobis, sicut disposuit mihi Pater meus, regnum, vt edatis &amp; bibatis super mensam meam, in regno meo;</hi> the good Archbishop, began to fetch his breath more thicke then ordinary. Whereupon the standers by, being aware of the approach of his last houre, after the due rites, and Sacraments applyed, taking him in their armes, they layd him downe, according to the manner of those tymes, vpon a Cilice, and Ashes; where he rendred his blessed soule to the Creatour, vpon Wednesday in Holy weeke, in the morning being the 21. day of Aprill, in the yeare 1109. or as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers would haue it 1080. and the 13. of his Bishopricke, and the 76. of his age.</p>
               <p>Being afterwards sockt, and reuested with his Pontificall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, he was decently layd forth in the Church, and buryed with most solemne Exequies, and with the sorrow that behoued, for the losse of such, and so great a Prelate. Many other, and great miracles, besides those that we haue touched, are recounted of him, the which notwithstanding altogether with me, make him not so venerable &amp; worthy of eternall prayse, as two only <hi>Qualities</hi> which he had, among others, in an excellent degree; to wit, his <hi>Discretion,</hi> and <hi>Assability</hi> with all. Most noble vertues without doubt, and such (as we haue sayd) that he aboue all other gifts, should be adorned withall, who desires to haue open, and manifest to him, the Soules and consciences of his subiects, and would seeke by due meanes, to lead them to some good point of Perfection, and Sanctity.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>THO, who was after Bishop of <hi>Bamberge,</hi> a Sueuian by nation (whose proper place, and Surname, is not knowne) was borne of the Count <hi>Bartold,</hi> and of the Countesse <hi>Sophia</hi> his wife; more noble of bloud, then rich in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, &amp; goods. Who after they had bred with diligent care, and with the help of a good Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, brought vp this sonne, dyed; and the gouernement of the house, fell into the hands of another Sonne, whose name was <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dericke,</hi> at such tyme indeed, as in forraigne parts, as it happened, <hi>Otho</hi> was busyed at his booke. Where he hauing with good ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause attended to the study of humanity, and to some part of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, and wanting sufficient meanes to proceed any further, by reason of the short allowance, which his Brother and other friends
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:12171:188"/>
affoarded him, he resolued, to the end he might not be grieuous &amp; burdensome to them, to passe ouer into <hi>Polony,</hi> where was as that tyme a great scarcity, and want of learned men. Heere then, for the teaching and instructing of youth, and withall likewise for his greater profit, he set vp open Schoole. And with this manner of life, comming shortly to be well knowne, not only for a pious and a learned, but euen also for a wise and discreet Man; he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased to himselfe, besides an honest, and competent meanes to liue, much reputation, and fauour also with the principall person<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages of those Countryes.</p>
               <p>There was added also to the learning and integrity of this ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of God, a maiesty in his countenance, and such a garb in his behaviour, and so noble a dexterity in his conuersation, as that after he had in diuers occurrences handled, and negotiated affai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of no small importance, he was by the Duke of <hi>Polony</hi> (for as yet, there was no Alteza, or Highnes of a King) sent in weighty affaires vnto the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, his Cousin. Who was likewise so pleased with the carriage, and prudence of <hi>Otho,</hi> as that the Embassage being ended, with the good leaue of his Cousin he retayned him with him, with some honourable title, among his Chaplaines: and a little after, the dignity of the great Chancellour being voyd, he most graciously conferred it vpon him. In which charge, <hi>Otho</hi> carryed himselfe so faythfully to the Prince, and with so much courtesy and humanity towardes others, as he made a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table increase of loue, and credit with persons of all sortes.</p>

                  <hi>S. Otho</hi> is preferred by the Emperour to be Bishop of <hi>Bamberge;</hi> and after some difficultyes is by the Citizens ioyfully receaued. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.</head>
               <p>THERE was in those dayes introduced among Christians an abuse of much preiudice to the holy Apostolike Sea, (and I would to God, there were not as yet some reliques thereof, to be seene likewise in these our dayes) that many Princes, and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Emperour, vnder the name of inuestitures, bestowed the Churches at their pleasure; and when a Bishopricke was vacant at any tyme, the Chapter would send to <hi>Caesar,</hi> the Pastorall staffe &amp; ring, beseeching his Maiesty to vouchsafe to prouide them a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour. Whence it came, that many personages, the children, &amp; nephewes of Barons, and great Lords, vnder diuers colours of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:12171:189"/>
done, would follow the Court of <hi>Caesar,</hi> to be promoted to some Bishoprike, or other, as it chaunced to fall. Now <hi>Robert</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Bamberge,</hi> a noble Citty of <hi>Franconia,</hi> being then decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and the sacred Pledges caryed vnto Court with the wonted supplication, <hi>Henry</hi> answeared, he would take tyme, for the space of six months, to thinke of a new election. In the meane while in <hi>Bamberge,</hi> were made continuall prayers, and pennances for that effect.</p>
               <p>The terme being ended, it was signified them by the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,</hi> that now, he had found a sufficient Pastour for that Church, though for the present he suppressed his Name, while that good people, continued still more feruent then euer in redoubling their deuotions. And among others, on the Vigill of <hi>Christmas day,</hi> was a solemne procession ordayned (where none was absent) from the Cathedrall, to the Church of S. <hi>Michael,</hi> on the Hil, taking that glorious <hi>Archangell</hi> for intercessour, with the diuine Majesty, to obtayne a Prelate, of the sufficiency and goodnes, which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired. And on the other side they sent Embassadours to <hi>Henry,</hi> to sollicite the expedition: &amp; in fumme neglected not any thing that concerned the happy issue of so important a busines. And the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Clemency, accustomed to heare the prayers of such as concurre on their parts, and manfully to set hand thereto; was pleased with the piety and industry of <hi>Bamberge,</hi> in putting into <hi>Caesars</hi> mynd, to put the designes in execution, as soone as might be. Thereupon, sending for the foresayd Embassadours to come vnto him, he spake to them, in the manner following.</p>
               <p>How deere to vs <hi>(Embassadours)</hi> your Church is, and euer hath been, from hence you may easely gather, that wee haue thought it not good to giue you a Rectour, till after a long &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture consult thereupon; and that surely with good reason: Foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the said Church, as you know, hath beene founded by our Progenitours, and adorned, and furnished of all things that seeme to appertayne to the splendour and mantenance of Christian Religion, and (which is more, and which cannot be affirmed but of few other Seas) the same ornaments, furnitures, and ancient riches, are kept very safe, and entire, vnto this day; so as reason would, for the custody, and administration of them, should be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ouer them, not an ordinary man, but one who were sage, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and zealous of the honour of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:12171:189"/>
And the <hi>Emperour</hi> proceeding to manifest more at large, this good disposition of his, towardes the Communalty of <hi>Bamberge,</hi> some of the Embassadours, being wearied already with such long and tedious ambages, could not hold themselues, but they must needs ingeniously demaund of him, where, and who he was, whome his Maiesty had so destined for the gouernement.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Henry</hi> cheerefully looking about: <hi>Behold him,</hi> sayd he, and taking <hi>Otho</hi> by the hand, that was (as we sayd) of a venerable aspect, and decently clad in a Clericall habit; <hi>This,</hi> sayd he, <hi>is your Lord, this is your Preist, and Bishop of Bamberge.</hi> There could not happen to the Embassadours eares, a more strange and vnexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted thing then it. Whence being astonished, and confounded, they began priuily to looke one vpon another, and to cast there eyes from tyme to tyme on the face of <hi>Otho.</hi> Whereof some of <hi>Caesars</hi> court being aware, who now for a long tyme, gad greedily expected to aspire to that seate and Liuing; with glaunces, nods and whispe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring began to stir vp the <hi>Bambergians</hi> to shew themselues not well satisfyed with such a nomination, and resolued not to accept it by any meanes. So as at last, with a sad countenance and free liberty, they turning themselues to <hi>Caesar,</hi> sayd: We hoped your Maiesty, would haue deputed to vs, some Prelate, who had been one of the most markable, and illustrious of the Court. Now for this man, we know not eyther, who he is, or whence he came. Then <hi>Caesar</hi> replyed with a seuere looke. We our selues, through long co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and infinite proofes haue had full, and perfect notice of this Subiect, his faythfullnes, his iudgement, and longanimity: his diligence, in small matters, and sufficiency in great, are not vnknowne to vs. Nor would we haue you to thinke but the losse of such a Minister must needes redound to the notable preiudice of our own seruice. From whence we see, as euery one may perceaue, the sincere affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction we beare to your Countrey, so as we in this election so much premeditated, are not to be altered in our iudgement. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer shall seeme to haue the boldnes to oppose this our decree, shall infallibly incurre our high displeasure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Otho</hi> hitherto had knowne nothing of any such deliberation made: Whereupon, as one astonished with a sudden blow, falling prostrate at the Emperours feet, began to powre forth a floud of teares. The Embassadours ran readily to reare him vp. He then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing taken a litle breath, refused the charge with might &amp; mayne:
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:12171:190"/>
esteeming, &amp; proclayming himselfe to be wholy vnworthy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: and affirming with all, that so high a degree became rather some other more noble, ancient, and well deseruing of the sacred crowne, then him. By occasion whereof, <hi>Caesar,</hi> re-entring agayne into <hi>Otho's</hi> prayses, among other things, made this publique de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, how this had beene the third Bishopricke, which the seruant of Christ had refused; how first he had offered him, that same of <hi>Augusta,</hi> then that of <hi>Halberstad,</hi> nor could euer hitherto seeme to fasten any one vpon him. From whence, very euidently appeared the modesty, the humility, and merits of such a persons through diuine dispensation reserued (as it should seeme) for the benefit and behoofe of the Citty of <hi>Bamberge.</hi> And with this, &amp; many other Elogies, and prayses, putting the ring on his fingar, and the Pastorall staffe in his hand, so adorned he giues him to the Embassadours.</p>
               <p>At sight whereof, with a sudaine inclination of minds, was immediately raysed a fauoutable cry, and applause of the whole multitude. The Embassadours beholding things to fall out thus, as truly from God, approaching to <hi>S. Otho,</hi> their Father, and Lord, saluted him cheerefully, and with Christian vertue, very reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently adored him; When as <hi>Henry</hi> sayd agayne, Accept him then with a good will, and vse him with that loue and veneration, as he deserues: because I call him to witnes who knoweth all things, that I know not a man in all the world, to whom more truly, and with greater reason so ample a charge as this may be conferred, then to him. And for my part, as long as I liue, and wield this Scepter, whosoeuer shall but touch him, shall touch the very aple of myne eye. In this manner then, and by such meanes as these, came <hi>S. Otho</hi> to be forced to the Bishopricke, but yet full of anxiety and scruples the while, as well for other very graue respects, as also, for the controuersies sprung vp, as we sayd before, by reason of inuestitures, betweene the Roman Church, &amp; Empire. And yet on the other side, considering, that his being now so often called to such a charge, could not choose but proceed from the diuine Wil, he feared least persisting in the negatiue, he might hap to incurre that dreadfull sentence, <hi>Noluit benedictionem, &amp; elongabitur ab eo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Amidst such streights and perplexityes as these, he finally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined with himselfe, to recurre as soone as might be, for ayde and light to the Apostolique Sea, and made an expresse vow ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:12171:190"/>
to admit of the Bishoprike, vnles at the instance of his flock the Pope himselfe should inuest, and consecrate him with his owne hands. With this resolution, he kept the Feast of the <hi>Natiuity of our Lord</hi> at <hi>Ments</hi> in company of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and from thence, dismissing a part of the Embassadours, he stayed in Court for vrgent reasons about some fourty dayes space: Which being ended, he tooke his leaue of <hi>Henry;</hi> and through his expresse commandement, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed to <hi>Bamberge,</hi> by the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Augusta,</hi> and of <hi>Herbipolis,</hi> &amp; of other principall personages besides, he made his solemne entry on the day before the <hi>Purification of the most blessed Virgin.</hi> The Monks and Clerkes, and all the Nobility, went forth to meete him in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly procession, with psalmes, and hymnes, and with rich orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and deuout reliques. Nor would the people, and meaner sort, suffer themselues to be vanquished with such offices of obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiousnes. While euery one, leauing their shopps, &amp; staules, ran striuing to kneele before him, and to demaund the benediction of their holy, and so long desired Pastour. In which feast, and solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity we may not passe ouer in silence one thing, that shewes very well that euen in the Courtiers life, who will but affoard any tyme to spirituall things, may make a notable purchase of religious vertues.</p>

               <p>S. <hi>Otho,</hi> as we haue seene, had spent the greater, and better part of his yeares, in the seruice of secular Princes, and liued in the exteriour, a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon life, and without any apparent singularity in him: And yet performing, according to occasions (which want not) intense acts of temperance, and humility, and of contempt of himselfe, in short tyme he became very rich in those habits, which more gallantly adorne and deck the soule, then doe all the Mitres, and Pontificall robes set forth the body. Whereof, he gaue a most clere example in the aforesayd day of his entrance so <hi>in Pontifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus.</hi> Because, that in comming to approach to <hi>Bamberge,</hi> as soone as he descouered a farre off the Cathedrall Church, being dedicated to S. George, he not only, according to the custome of that Bisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricke, dismounted suddenly from his horse, but also putting off his hose and shooes publiquely in the hart of winter, went bare foote
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:12171:191"/>
and bare legg on stones, and yee through the presse of people vnto the Church, where the sharpnes of the cold, hauing (not without danger of his health) now possessed already, as it were, the vitall parts, and a hot Bath being suddenly applyed to him for present re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, he suddenly called for cold water, when putting his legges thereinto, with one rigour, he expelled the other: and then besids the accustomed ceremonyes, hauing deuoutly made his prayers, and with the holsome signes, with his sacred hand giuen his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storall benediction to the people, being tyred and spent, at last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred himselfe into his lodging. After which, the first and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall care of <hi>S. Otho,</hi> was to render his vow, and to giue due ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his actions to the Bishop of Bishops, and generall Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent of the whole Church of Christ.</p>
               <p>And though he well perceiued the danger he incurred therein of offending <hi>Henry,</hi> there being nothing, that more touches Princes to the quicke, then the point of <hi>Iurisdiction;</hi> yet for all that, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring euer a good conscience, and a chast feare of God, before any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther respect whatsoeuer, he first reduced the Clergy, and people of <hi>Bamberge</hi> to his opinion; shewing them the obligation that was of acknowledging the supreme power of the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> Then by letters, hauing obteined leaue of the Pope himselfe to kisse his seete, he went with an honourable traine of his followers, and familiars, and of the principall of his Church, to the Court of Rome, the Pope (who was then <hi>Paschalis</hi> the <hi>Second)</hi> then residing at <hi>Anagni,</hi> a Citty in <hi>Latium.</hi> Where <hi>S. Otho</hi> arriuing within the Octaues of the Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, after the kisse of his holy feete, very faithfully declared to the Pope, the whole order and progresse of his promotion, without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing any thing of moment: and to accompany his wordes with deedes, without more a doe puts the ring and staffe at his feete, and humbly craues pardon of the offence, succeeding meerely by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers violence, rather then of his owne inclination, demaunding withall pennance, and Canonicall censure for the same.</p>
               <p>On the other side, the Procuratours of <hi>Bamberge,</hi> do neuer cease to beseech the Pope, he would daigne to confirme, or to say better, renew the election, made by <hi>Henry,</hi> &amp; not to depriue their Countrey of so exemplar, and behoouefull a guide, Maister, &amp; Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter.

(sayd the Pope) drawing neere, we will remit the controuersy to him. And after some discourses, the Bishop, and the others returned to their lodgings, with the Apostolicall benediction, but yet with a diuerse disposition of mind, and quality of thoughts: The subiects with a firme hope of obtayning as much as they desired of the Pope, and the Prelate himselfe with a purpose to relinquish the Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke by all meanes possible. And being all that night, and the day following intensly fixt in contemplating the reasons, that were of eyther part: finally pondering the malice of the tymes, the encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances, troubles, and molestations, and daungers of the Episcopall state, the disobedience, contumacy, and insolency of the inferiours, and in summe, all the asperityes, and difficultyes of such a charge, he determined with a full and firme resolution, to reduce himselfe to a priuate life, and calling his companions and domestiques to him very plainely vnfolded to them his whole deliberation, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay being dispatched of the Pope, and Court, put himselfe on the way towards <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But scarcely had he made one dayes iourney, when a Post ouertakes him from his Holynes, who calls him back. Which thing was an incredible disgust, and extreme trouble to <hi>S.

But being the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouercome by the precept, and encouraged by the prayers, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations of his followers, with feare and trembling he returned to the Pope agayne, and without being able to resist any longer, on the day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> while the Masse was sung, with great iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biley of the <hi>Bambergians,</hi> and vniuersall ioy of the whole Court among other demonstrations of charity and esteeme, had likewise the priuiledge to haue caryed before <hi>Him</hi> and <hi>his Successours</hi> for euer, the Crosse and Pall, eight tymes a yeare; Whereas his Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours, had them caryed, but foure tymes only. Which fauour he accepted with great thankes-giuing, not so much for his owne res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, as for the loue of his Espouse, whose exaltation for the diuine seruice, was worthily most deare vnto him. But yet more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to <hi>S.

Wherein expressing the figure of perfect Benignity, he spared from himselfe whatsoeuer he could, the better to supply the commodityes of others, affecting as well parsimony in priuate, as magnificence in publique, and aboue all things farre off from any shew of superfluity, and those sumptuous dishes, which vnder coulour of state and decorum, are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly afforded the greater and richer Prelates.</p>

               <p>The Duke <hi>Boleslaus</hi> ruled the <hi>Poland</hi> nation at that tyme, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage of much valour, and singular piety.

               <p>The prayers and perswasions of <hi>Boleslaus,</hi> were not in vayne: Like a generous Falcon that discouers its prey, so was <hi>S. Otho</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately

By whome being encouraged to so noble a Conquest, and prouided of necessary facultyes for the purpose, he puts himselfe on the way; from thence passing through <hi>Bohemia</hi> into <hi>Polony,</hi> with three Priests only for his helpfull assistance, he arriued in <hi>Pomerania;</hi> being ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably met, in the Confines thereof, by <hi>Christiernus</hi> Prince of those Countreyes, who at the instance of <hi>Boleslaus,</hi> against the will of his Wife, and Subiects, had been now already baptized.</p>

               <p>Such wordes spake the Bishop, with voyce and gestures well able to demonstrate they came not from any sudden fit of passion, but from a resolute and stable purpose: and the Abbot being asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished

at so new a demand, not to constristate the sicke man, for that tyme would by no meanes deny him, but rather with a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full countenance, commending the good desire he had, made shew to accept of his prompt Obedience, reseruing the execution of the rest, to his better health. In the meane while, the feruorous No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, finding himselfe to be somewhat better recouered, and not seeing the houre of fullfilling his vow to come, hauing disposed as secretly as he could, the thinges belonging to him, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay requires the habit of Religion; and makes new instance to be sent into the Monastery so conualescent and weake at he was. But the discreet Superiour on the one side being edifyed at so great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility of his; and on the other, in much suspence for the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance &amp; quality of the busines, calling after prayer some graue &amp; experienced men to consult, he proposed the Bishops request; and all hauing well examined the matter, did answere it to be without doubt, to the seruice of God, that a man of so eminent vertue, &amp; behoouefull to so great a multitude, should go forwardes rather to shine on the Candlesticke of the Church, as a burning and resplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant light, then by aspiring to a priuate life to hide himselfe vnder a bushell, within Cloisters, though otherwise holy, and laudable in it selfe.</p>
               <p>With this answeare, the Abbot being assured, and confirmed in his former iudgment, goes his wayes to S. <hi>Otho:</hi> who like vnto a weight that approached neerer to its center, longed so much the more for subiection, pouerty, and solitude, as the confidence was greater, which he had conceaued already of obtayning his intent; and approaching to him with due reuerence, demanded of him, if he held still his purpose to maintayne the Obedience with deeds, which he had promised him with words: and he cheerefully ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearing, that for the loue of him, who to the eternall Father had obserued it to death, he was readily disposed to keep it, without exception. Then (replyed the Abbot) on behalfe of the same Lord, do I command thee to perseuere to the end vnder the charge of the administration thou hast in hand, and couragiously to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the way begun to the glory of God, behoofe of the holy Church, consolation to the faythfull, the support of Widdowes, Pupills, and Orphans, and to continue thy life in good workes, &amp; in summe, to doe what thou dost, and to execute the office thou art in, to gayne at the Prince of Pastours handes the eternall life, and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:12171:195"/>
reward a hundred fould. Because, that if we would but weigh thinges indeed with equall ballances, what Monke liues at this day vnder the Sunne, of so much abstinence, and of so great perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, whose merits and pouerty, may seeme to stand in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, with the care and solicitude, thou hast of so many soules, and with the sweet dispensation of so great riches? So as thou mayst quiet thy selfe, with the authority of him, whome thou hast taken as guide and consellour in this behalfe. And let the diuine honour and publike vtility be preferred before thyne owne particuler gusts and contentments.</p>
               <p>With such reasons, S. <hi>Otho</hi> being lastly conuinced, as an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy of selfe-loue, and farre from all pertinacy, without more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes, did bow downe his head; and putting a fresh the most bitter chalice of gouernement to his mouth, with new breath, and with redoubled purposes he began to giue himselfe wholy to the spiritual and temporall help of his Neighbours.</p>

               <p>FOrasmuch, as among Episcopall parts and conditions (as hath been sayd) S. <hi>Otho</hi> knew well, that Hospitality was one of the cheifest, he endeauoured to send before him as much corne, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualls, cloathes, and monyes, as he could possibly procure, by the hands of the poore, but now especially, feeling himselfe to be so loaden with yeares, and neere to the tearme of his life.

To the desolate Widdowes, forlorne Orphans, and the needy and necessitous Clerks, and Monkes, stood his granary open day, and night, his Purse, and Wardrobe neuer shut; but like a wise merchant, in the short mart of this transitory tyme, he attended to barter and exchange terrene for heauenly, frayle for eternall and incorruptible ware. In summe, besides the secret almes of ech day there was not in all those partes, a Church, Conuent, Hospitall, or pious place of any sort, which he visited not, restored, and roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

prouided of what was necessary, for the Maiesty of pure Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and continuation of Christian verity. And it was an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable thing to see, how so much giuen away, and so much empting, he continually should find no bottome, as if the great Lord, and his carefull Steward, should seeme to striue togeather, the one to supply, and the other to distribute with a large hand, all manner of goodes, gold, and siluer, and what not?</p>
               <p>Amidst such actions as these, truly worthy of the lawfull Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour of the Apostles, the blessed Man being now arriued to the end of his dayes, maturely composed the affaires of his Diocesse, and hauing made a pure and deuout confession, and after the holy Oyle, receauing with great feeling the holy Eucharist; being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironed round with a company of Clerks, and Religious, most sweet and deare vnto him, who in that last passage came all to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend him to their common Creatour, he peaceably yielded vp his soule, well fraught and replenished with good workes, and full of honours, and heauenly graces.</p>
               <p>As for the mourning and great concourse of people wherewith his Exequies were celebrated, it importes not much to treate ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; while euery one may sufficiently gather how great a desire of his presence, might so louing a Father, and so vigilant a Rectour, seeme to leaue behind him.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the partes of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> is a place which is called <hi>Fontaine,</hi> obscure heertofore and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, but deseruedly famous and renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, after it had so affoarded to the world, that mirour of vertue and light of Sanctity, which now to the glory of God, we beginne to des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe. In that very place, was an honourable Knight, called <hi>Tesselinus,</hi> who according to the Euangelicall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, being contented with his paye, and farre from all insolency and rapine whatsoeuer, so applyed himselfe to Military discipline, as he forgot not the profession of Christ. This man had a wife, both chast and fruitfull, by name <hi>Aletta de Monte Barro,</hi> who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst the familiar and transitory cares of the world, keeping her mind still fixed on eternall goodes, did increase so much in deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that as many children as she brought forth into the world,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:12171:197"/>
(which were in number some six Sonnes, and one Daughter) ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them all one by one in her armes, she suddenly offered them to Iesus; and from that tyme forwardes, as thinges made sacred, in a certaine manner, would she nurse ech one at her owne breasts, instilling into them, togeather with the milke, the feare of God, &amp; Christian piety. And after they came to be weaned, would she feed them with grosse, and more common meates, &amp; keep them wholy from all pampering, and childish sports, as if she had of purpose trayned them to a monasticall life. Nor was the proiect of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Mother any whit in vaine, since finally all of them, one by one (as we shall see in the progresse of the whole narration) tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough solemne vowes of Religion, came thence to be the Seruants of Christ. Of these, was <hi>S. Bernard</hi> borne in the third place, whose glorious merits (as they report) euen iust in a manner as of <hi>S. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicke,</hi> were through diuine ordination foretold, and prefigured ere he was borne into the World.</p>
               <p>For as the Mother was resting one night in her bed, it seemed to her in sleep, she had a little white Dogge in her wombe, which made a great barking; wherat the poore wretch being exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sad and disconsolate, demanded of a venerable Monke the true signification thereof. Who suddenly conceauing with the spirit of Prophesy, answered her: Feare not, Madame, all is well, there is an excellent Dogge, to proceed from you, which both with his barking shall faythfully guard the flocke of Christ, and with his medicinall tongue, shall heale the diuers infirmities of many and many a soule. <hi>Aletta</hi> being glad at such an Oracle, gaue infinite thankes therefore vnto the Creatour; and from that tyme after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards applyed her mind with particuler diligence to bring vp that child. So as at last being deliuered of him, she was not content, as she had done with the rest, to offer him to God only with priuate and domestique ceremonyes, but in imitation of the blessed <hi>Anna</hi> the Mother of <hi>Samuel,</hi> carrying him in her armes into the Temple, with a singular affect of Charity, did dedicate him to the diuine seruice. After this, she diligently attended to the nursing and tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him vp, and as soone as he seemed to be capable of discipline, sent him presently to the Church of <hi>Castiglio,</hi> vnto approued Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters there to learne, as well good literature, as manners.</p>
               <p>The child, as he was elected by the diuine Prouidence, and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for high and great enterprizes, so was he likewise of a rare wit,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:12171:198"/>
and of an excellent inclination withall. Whence it came, that as wel in his studyes in short tyme, he left all his companions behind him; as also in solid vertues, he beganne to giue forth those buds, which in progresse of tyme shot vp to such a height of perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as they did. There was seene to be discouered in him, euen in those very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der yeares of his, a meruaylous maturity in all thinges: As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples sake, to recommend himselfe often to God, without omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the while, the exercises of the Schoole; very seldome to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; to keep silence, and modesty at home; to shew himselfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne and louing to all: and if any money chanced to come into his handes, he would presently giue it freely in voluntary almes: but aboue all, he obeyed his Elders with great reuerence. With such behauiour as this, the Child became most gratefull in the sight of God, and Men. And euen in that very tyme, he also gaue forth a very notable signe of his Predestination. Because, that being fallen sicke on a tyme in his bed, through a grieuous payne of the head, there came a Witch vnto him, who promised him to cure him of the head-ach. But he was so farre off from admitting of any such cure at her hands, as that not without the astonishment of all there present, he beganne at the first sight of her, to cry out vpon her with all his might and mayne, and with a holy disdayne very suddenly draue her away thence. In this manner, the chast Disciple of Christ conserued purity, and increased in learning, when through diuine reuelation, the Catholicke Fayth was both established in his breast, and also an extraordinary flame of Charity, enkindled therein, as shall appeare more cleerely heereafter.</p>

                  <hi>S. Bernard</hi> as yet a youth, had an admirable vision in sleep: He shewes a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table example of Chastity. And his Mother dying, he after some difficultyes resolues to follow the diuine counsayles. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.</head>
               <p>ON the night of the Natiuity, while <hi>S. Bernard</hi> was in the Church with others attending the diuine Office, falling sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly into a slumber, he had the vnspeakable grace, to behold the manner by which the Sauiour and Spouse of human generation, went forth heeretofore from the intemerate chamber of the Virgin Mary, with a firme perswasion, that he euen iust at that houre, was truly and really borne. From which sight, it cannot be expressed, what iubiley, and spirituall sweetenes <hi>S. Bernard</hi> tooke. And hence
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:12171:198"/>
it was, that as he had the holy Church, and all the articles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by it, in the highest veneration that might be; so, as long as he liued afterwards, he had a particular ioy in this solemnity, and peculiar feeling of this sacred mystery: and (as partly may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his Homelies) he did always seeme to discourse thereof with admirable gust, and a blessed fluency of conceipts and words there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Through this fauour, being exceedingly confirmed, he passed ouer the first part of his age, without any rub at all, or great contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. But comming afterwards in the beginning of his youth, there wanted no probations, so much more grieuous, as they were full of allurements &amp; flatteryes.</p>
               <p>Though S. <hi>Bernard</hi> of himselfe, were of a tender complexion: yet was he of a good stature withall, and of lyneame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts very well in shew, and liuely withall; so as more then once he had hapned to be importunely courted, and molested by lasciuious women, but still in vayne. Because that most noble and precious iewell of Chastity, was euer kept by the holy Youth, with so much iealousy, as that he hauing one day, for a very little space, vnwarily set his eyes on a womans face; as soone as he perceiued the daunger, falling into rage with himselfe for it, in the depth of winter, immediately he stripped himselfe, and entred vp to the necke into a Poole hard by, of most cruell cold water: where with much maceration he remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned so long, till he had fully extinguished in himselfe all sinister in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiues of mind, &amp; body.</p>
               <p>In this meane while, <hi>Aletta</hi> the mother, after she had sweetly liued many yeares with her husband without iarres, and had had many Children by him, well and religiously brought vp, leauing them all aliue, came to the end of her dayes; which through the iust retribution of God, was answerable to the life she had led. For that hauing liued (as much as the band of Wedlocke, and care of the house, would suffer) in continuall abstinences, prayers, and vigills, she fell grieuously sicke, &amp; being now through the malady brought into extremes, hauing receiued the Sacraments, with much deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, while the standers by were reciting the Psalter about her, she went still a long with them, with a weake voyce; and when she could do no more rherewith, at least, she would follow on, with the gestures of her Countenance, and with the motion of her pale lips, vntil such tyme, as being now abandoned of all naturall heate, when rehearsing the Litanyes, they came to those wordes,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:12171:199"/>
                  <hi>Per crucem &amp; passionem tuam,</hi> lifting vp her hand, and making the signe of the Crosse, she happily expired. A Matrone surely most noble, truly pious, and worthy to be imitated of all those who in coniugall state, hauing the body in power of the husband, with the soule do seeke to serue and please Christ only.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Bernard</hi> being thus depriued of such a guide, began now on all sides to be continually more cruelly assaulted, then euer. The flower of his age proposed to him sensuall delights, exhorting him mainely, not to leaue things certayne, for perillous, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent for those to come: and that heereafter when he would doe pennance, he should want no tyme in his elder age, exaggerating withal the diuine clemency, which knowes very well our human frailty; and putting him in mind moreouer of the merits of Christs passion, whreupon very safely he might build himselfe. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, his freinds, and companions, who being affrighted with the difficultyes of vertue, had entred into the spacious way, inuited him no lesse thereunto, with diuers persuasions and examples. Nor was the world behind, to offer him riches, possessions, &amp; pallaces. Besides which, the very qualityes themselues, wherewith he was endowed, of wit, of learning, and of a gratefull presence suggested to him, sundry hopes of honours, dignityes, &amp; withal an immortal name. And all these fantasyes as so much fuell on the fire, the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient aduersarie alwayes enkindled in him, and that so much the liuelyer as he was of a quicker discourse, and of a sharper appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension. Who perceiuing himselfe so enuironed on all sides with such subtle nets, precipices, and snares, and iustly fearing the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, which he bare about him as shut vp in his breast, very sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly determined to secure the same, and that by no other meanes, then by the counsayls of the eternall Wisedome.</p>

our Lord 1098. This Congregation now, as is wont to happen in beginnings, was at that tyme but of small renowne, and had but one only Monastery, within a certaine remote wood: whereunto very few had entered, through the straitnesse of the Enclosure, and asperity of life. But the feruent young man, and freind of the lowlynes and pouertie of Christ, iudged it straight very apt for his designes, which were to suffer, and to be hidden, and farre off from all occasions of vaine glory. In such thoughts was <hi>S. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> much perplexed, and in great suspence, and gaue besides, diuers other signes of inclination to retire himselfe, while his more dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stique and neerest freinds (which in such occasions are wont to be the greatest enemyes,) endeauour to disswade him from it, and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby gaue him very shrewd encounters. They alleadged to him the delicatenes of his complexion, that could not frame to the austerity and labours of cloysters; they proposed to him manie other wayes of seruing God, and of helping soules, without going so to submit himselfe to a perpetuall seruitude; and stuck not to put scruples in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his head, with burying such &amp; such talents in a desart, which to the glory of God, and light of human kind were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to him: and how much better were it, that following the course begun of learning, and of higher sciences in a quiet life, he should become a famous Doctour, &amp; honour to his parents, a glorie to his Countrey, and a succour to the world?</p>
               <p>With these, and other such like reasons his deerest freinds went about to recall him from his purpose. Of all which (as the Saint manifested afterwardes) there was none made so great impression with him, as the desire and commoditie to prosecute his studyes. This only respect did giue him a shrewd blow, and had euen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most quite ouercome him. Whence they may take faire warning, who haue had a vocation of God, and learne with what caution and custody they are to keep it, and not to communicate the same, but to some person who is very spirituall and chosen of a thousand; following heerein that wary Merchant of the Ghospell, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing discouered a treasure in a field, hides the same, and sells what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuer he possesseth to purchase that field: which aduertisement not so fully obserued by <hi>S. Bernard,</hi> had well nigh depriued him of so great a felicity.</p>
               <p>But besides the diuine Clemency, and his good nature, he was helped not a little also by the memory of his blessed Mother, who
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:12171:200"/>
had alwayes with so many aduises and motiues incited him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and not to fall into tepidity, to the seruice of God, and not to vanity of the world, to the verity and humility of Christ, and not to the pride and swelling of secular wisedome.</p>
               <p>With these thoughts and holesome aduises sustayned he the battayle, yet so, as the good youth went still wauering with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, vntill one day taking his iourney to visite his Brothers, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped with the Duke of Burgundy at the siege of <hi>Grancium,</hi> he felt himselfe so afflicted and tormented with the foresayd assaults of the spirit and sense, as that finding no rest, he retyred himselfe into a Church by the streetes side, and there with a shower of teares, and with deep sighes vnfolding his afflicted hart in the fight of him that created it, he perseuered so long in praying, and imploring help, and light from heauen, as that finally all doubt and perple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xity being taken away, he felt himselfe fortifyed in the course of perfect vertue, as being now without feare of euer seuering any more, he resolued with himselfe to reduce thereunto as many as he could. Nor was his enterprize in vaine awhit, while the Highest most powerfully cooperated withall.</p>
               <p>The first assault he gaue (being arriued to the Campe) was to his Brothers, and an Vncle of his by the Mothers side, by name <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

At which aspect <hi>Andrew</hi> yielded himselfe, crying out: I see our Mother; and so he promised to <hi>S. Bernard</hi> to do what he would. These two were his younger Brothers.</p>

Neuerthelesse <hi>S.

And how much more he was encouraged the next morning, when as entring with S. <hi>Bernard</hi> and others into the Church, he heard those wordes of <hi>S. Paul</hi> recited: <hi>Fidelis est Deus, quia qui coepit in vobis opus bonum, ipse perficiet vs<expan>

Likewise <hi>S. Bernard</hi> and the rest, could not but receaue exceeding comfort heereby.</p>
               <p>There was only one doubt yet left, whether <hi>Guido's</hi> wife would giue her consent, or no. And yet howsoeuer, if she denyed it, he determined with a generous and pious mind to disperse what ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches he had to the poore, and labouring with his handes to liue in the state of pennance, and to maintaine himselfe and family with his owne labours. But S. <hi>Bernard</hi> deliuered him from that anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, affirming for certaine, that the Wife very soone would eyther yeild consent, or end her life. And indeed the same succeeded, for that she shewing her selfe somewhat difficult in that busines, was seized on with so grieuous and bitter an infirmity, as that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the hand of God vpon her, she resisted no longer, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting liberty to her husband, allowing good meanes for her Daughters maintenance, became likewise her selfe a Nunne, to the exceeding great consolation of <hi>Guido</hi> her Father; and in that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious course she perseuered euen to her dying day, not without the wonder of all. <hi>Guido</hi> in this manner being quit of all temporall cares, had leasure to attend very fully to the spirit.</p>
               <p>It was not so easy a matter to encline <hi>Gerard</hi> to this, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Brother. This man, besides that he was a braue Souldiar, was also very wise according to the world, and likewise benigne
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:12171:201"/>
and beloued of all. This sudden mutation of his Brothers pleased him not awhit, he interpreted the same to a certaine mobility and leuity of mind; and in summe after he had disputed a good while, he peremptorily denyed to consent euer to alter his profession. When S. <hi>Bernard</hi> wholy full of fire and zeale, putting forth the fingar to his side: I see well (sayth he) that tribulation only is to giue you vnderstanding. The day shall come, and that ere long, that a launce entring through this side of yours, shall set open the doore of your obstinate hart vnto the holesome counsaile, which now you will not accept from me. And so it fell out; for a little while after being encompassed by his enemyes, he tooke a blow with a launce in the same side, and being taken prisonner, and dragd through the streetes, began as one besides himselfe to cry out, <hi>I am a Monke: I am a Cistercian Monke:</hi> and sayd nor amisse, for that he had no sooner his liberty againe, but he went to submit himself to the sweet yoke of Christ, with the great ioy of S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> and the rest, who most ardently thirsted after his saluation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Beniamin</hi> remayned, who was the youngest of all, by name <hi>Ninardus.</hi> This same did the others thinke good to leaue in the world for a stay of the house, and for the more consolation of their old Father: but he neither would be excluded of the heauenly benediction, because that <hi>Guido</hi> meeting him one day in the market place togeather with some other boyes: Go too <hi>Ninardus</hi> (sayd he vnto him) all our goods are like to fall vpon thee. To which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des the child answered not with a childish iudgement: Belike then heauen is for you, and the earth for me: there is no equality in that partition. And so after some dayes he also dedicated himselfe to the seruice of Christ. In the meane tyme, it pleased S. <hi>Bernard</hi> to goe vp, and downe the neighbour-places for new conquests. Going forth then in the name of our Lord, he began to preach in diuers places, of the instability of human things, of the vanity of honours, of the shortnes of pleasures, of the miseries of this life, and of the rewards and punishments of the other: and this with such an elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and grace, and efficacy withall, as like a deuouring flame, he transformed into himselfe what ere he met withall. And final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the matter passed so farre, as the Mothers hid their children, and Wiues their husbandes, and friends diuerted friendes from listning to the reasons and discourses of the feruorous youth, least happily against their will they might be rapt away with that impe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>THis troupe of new souldiers of Christ, assembled themselues in <hi>Castighone,</hi> where though in secular habit, yet liued they all in the same house in common with so much peace and concord, that as it is reported of the Primitiue Church, of all that multitude there was but one hart and soule only. And through the great ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration wherein they were with the people, there was hardly found any one, that durst approach to looke into their actions: and if perhaps any entred into their lodgings, in beholding the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall vnion, and order, and distribution of tyme, and Offices, the spirituall conferences, the singing of Canonicall Houres, &amp; other deuout exercises; they acknowledged the diuine assistance to be there without doubt, and eyther they remayned there also with the same intent, or at least departed thence compunct and ful of good desires, calling that Congregation <hi>Thrice happy, and fortunate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this manner while the domesticall affaires of some of them were in handling, they remayned in the sayd place some six mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ths at least. But perceauing afterwards a manifest danger in a longer aboad there, especially for that in fine, two being miserably sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Diuell, were fallen backe; it seemed good to <hi>S. Bernard</hi> and the others, to stay there no longer: so as all impediments being remoued or cut off, calling on the diuine assistance they repayred to the Monastery of Cisterce some fifteen years after the sayd house began. The number of these new disciples of Christ were about thirty, a very seasonable supply no doubt to that Congregation, which now already through the foresayd occasions was euen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most brought to nothing.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, the Abbot <hi>Stephen</hi> who gouerned at that tyme, being <hi>Roberts</hi> successour, and those few which as yet were remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:12171:202"/>
with him, receaued incredible comfort, with a firme hope of a long posterity, according to a certaine reuelation had a little before by one of those first Monkes; to whome being anxious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout fayling of the Order, at the end of his life, was represented an innumerable multitude of persons, who at the fountaine neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church were all washing their owne garments. By this meanes (through diuine grace) was <hi>Cisterce</hi> restored. And to this good worke was added another, to set vp at <hi>Villeo</hi> a place hard by, a Conuent for the wiues of as many of those Nouices as concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring piously to the promotion of the diuine seruice, had beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to acquit their husbandes of the coniugal band, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to offer vp themselues also in Holocausts to the Creatour of all, to whose diuine Maiesty, how gratefull that sacrifice was, may well be comprehended by the notable increase, which the sayd Conuent of Nuns made in a short tyme, as well of number of subiects, as of meanes to liue.</p>
               <p>But to returne to the Saint, as soone as he saw himselfe in the schoole of Christ, the first thing was to plant in his hart an immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueable perseuerance, in speaking within himselfe, at what tyme eyther case inuited him, or labours deterred him: <hi>Bernard, Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, to what end didst thou enter in?</hi> And for repressing of vnprofitable appetites for the soule, because he knew well, how much the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody of senses auayled, he was so wary and diligent in the heed thereof, and especially of his eyes, as that after a whole yeare of his Nouitiate, when he went from thence, he knew not as then, whether the seelings of the chamber were painted, or of fret-worke. And though he had entred so often into the Church, where there were indeed many windowes at the vpper end, he neuer thought there had been more then one. Besides, he kept himselfe at all tymes from all leuityes and sports, and from all those things which are wont to slacken the soule. Much laughing, a thing so proper vnto man, was seldome in him; and when it was, it was without excesse, and forced as it were, vsing it sometymes, nor to seeme froward in things wherin commonly others hardly could forbeare. He was moreouer exceeding sober and vigilant; refection was a torment to him; at his rising from table, he would allwayes make examen vpon what he had eaten, and if he had found he had pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the boundes in any thing, he would not let the fault be vnpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished. He had sleep in horrour, as a resemblance of death, and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:12171:202"/>
that repose which, enforced through extreme necessity, he was wont to take, was superficiall only, and so small, as to any but him, would haue giuen no refreshment at all. Whence if he saw any of the Religious to sleep vndecently, or snoring, he could hardly endure it, saying, such an one slept like a secular.</p>
               <p>But such excesse of watchings and fastings could not chose, but bring also exceeding hurt and detriment to his health, since in progresse of tyme, his stomack together with the diminution of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall heate, came very much to be depriued of the retentiue fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty: and the tongue and palate, the body being of so noble a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature, thereby came so to loose the tast, as that among other things, through imprudence of him that serued, for some dayes he liued of sheeps-suet, insteed of butter, drinking some tymes very oyle insteed of water, his eyes not looking vpon it. And these vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuous meates, he would hardly endure to be set before him, euen in tyme of conualescency: for ordinartly hefed for most part on no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else then bread, dipt in hoat water, or some broath made of pulse, or else a little milke: and if perhappes sometymes he were fayne to tast any wine, the cup would returne from his mouth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, as if it had not been touched at all.</p>

               <p>FRom this mortification of the flesh, though otherwise but litle rebellious or disobedient to the spirit, and by such manner of recollecting of the interiour powers, came that blessed soule of S. <hi>Bernard</hi> in short tyme to square it selfe, and to be purifyed in such manner, as like to a polished and lucid glasse, it receaued right well, the rayes of eternall Wisedome, and he not only purchased a most excellent habit of meditation and prayer, but euen mounted also anone to a very high degree of contemplation, by meanes whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof being abstracted from exteriour operations, and liquifyed with ineffable sweetnes, in a deep silence, he would vnite himselfe, with most chast embraces of the highest good. Besides, in the very mechanical occupations themselues, through a certayne priuiledge, he had the grace, together with the whole outward man, to attend to the worke in hand, and with interiour to deale and discourse with God, satisfying the conscience with the one, &amp; with the other
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:12171:203"/>
feeding the will. For indeed S. <hi>Bernard</hi> was none of those, who vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretext of contemplation, eschew trauayle, or els for priuate gust, forgo the publique good: so as hardly with greiuous and most irksome maladies could he be drawne from the Quire, where with grauity and wonderfull modesty he would perseuere in praysing and blessing God. In the labours of the hand likewise he abhorred all liberty, or any manner of exemption at all: as if he euen but then entred into the Monastery.</p>
               <p>Going once with the Monkes to reaping of corne, and not knowing well how to vse his sikle, he was bid to sit downe, and rest himselfe; whereat he being sad, prayed with such feruour to God, that he might not be vnprofitable, as that changing on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den his manner, he began to reape so readily and dexterously, as if all his life he had neuer practised any thing els. True it is, that in the exercises which required much strength of lymmes, as in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of burthens, in digging and deluing the ground, and other such like workes, when through his delicate complexion he was ready to sincke vnder the same, he would get himselfe to some seruices lesse difficult, but yet more abiect and vile; so recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in that manner the paynes and trauayle of the one, with the basenes of the other, and shewing himselfe alwayes as might be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall or rather inferiour to his companions. And these rules he did keep in thinges which were imposed by the Superiours, either to him in particuler, or to the Conuent in generall. But when the ministery was not common, and the obedience exacted no corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall application, then <hi>S. Bernard</hi> being abstracted from visible thing he would be so absorpt in the attention of the mind, as in him all operation, and all sensitiue memory, as it were seemed quite to be extinct. To which purpose are recounted two notable examples.</p>
               <p>The one, that he hauing as it were, all day trauayled along the Lake of <hi>Losana,</hi> and his companions at night discoursing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he demanded of them very seriously, what Lake was that they talked of?</p>
               <p>The other example was, that he being to visit the Monkes of <hi>Chertosa,</hi> there was brought him in hast by a stranger or secular a steed well appoynted, and hansomly furnished, wheron the holy man being mounted, and come to the Charter-house, was hardly wellcome, and intreated with much reuerence by the seruants of God: who remayned all exceedingly edifyed with their ghest; faue
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:12171:203"/>
only with the furniture of his horse, while to them it seemed, such quaintnes therein, gaue no good odour of pouerty: so as the Prior himselfe could not hold, but must needes breake a iest thereupon to one of <hi>S Bernards</hi> companions, who with religious zeale soone told it to the Father: and he turning himselfe on the one side to the Priour, and on the other to the horse; made shew with great since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity also himselfe to wonder at such trappings, ingenuously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing, he neuer had perceaued the same. At which wordes, the good Priour in a manner remayned confounded, for hauing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe at first sight noted a thing, which the other well mortifyed in the sense of the eyes, and attentiue to the interiour, could not once discerne in so great a iourney, and space of tyme.</p>
               <p>Besides which, the diuine man, not only in commodious and easy things, but euen likewise in publique mortifications was farre off from all manner of noueltyes: in so much as hauing for some yeares very secretly worne a cilice, being an austerity not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by the institute, and the same by accident being discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he layd it suddenly aside, not to seeme singular to men, or eminent among others. And this was also the occasion, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit pouerty was euer grateful to him; yet shu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned he as much to be wholy careles of the exteriour habit, and to seeme vncleanely, which in a manner is wont to turne away mens eyes from one.</p>
               <p>The very same may be sayd of the Saints learning and grauer studyes. He was wont in the fields and woods, treating with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and God only, to receiue frequent lights from heauen: and in prayer and meditation to penetrate the highest Misteryes of Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Whence to his more confident and dearest freindes, with a religious iest he affirmed sometymes, he neuer had other Maysters, then Beeches and Oakes. Neuerthelesse, that the world might not thinke he had been taught miraculously, he fayled not to read, and read ouer agayne whole bookes at tymes, and in the very reading was accustomed with particuler delight and profit of spirit, to stick vpon the text and words of the sacred Scripture, with leasure ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating vpon them, and therewith deducing rare and strange conceipts, and therewith afterwardes helping himselfe with that copy, elegancy, and dexterity, as his diuine treatises &amp; discourses shew. And notwithstanding with much humility also, he would consider the studyes and interpretations of the Fathers and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique doctours, not comparing euer his opinion with theirs, but <gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">

And since it was not in his power to part her from her husband, at least he aduised her of the daunger she was in, by following so her senses, and exhorted her, that abandoning those vanityes; while tyme yet serued, she should attend to do pennanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The wordes of the seruant of God were of no light moment: they enkindled in that breast as in a solid and substantiall matter, so tenacious and burning a fire of Charity, as returning home, not without the astonishement of as many as knew her, she cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>IN the meane tyme, the Cistercian family, according to the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, made a notable increase, and multiplyed in such manner, as in the space of few yeares, there was plenty of them through di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Kingdomes and Prouinces. And now at this tyme the resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such as tooke the habit grew not (as sometymes it happens) through temporal necessities, or humane dessignes, but sprung (for the most part) from supernall and generous motiues, partly fortold, and partly also obtayned through the prayers of the Saint, as may cleerely appeare by some, for example sake, which we will heere put downe.</p>
               <p>At the fame of the man of God, came a troupe of gallants to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit him, being all very dissolute yong men. Now, <hi>Quinquagesima</hi> was a tyme, when the Catholike Church, all sad, for the bitter fall of our first Parents, exhortes mankind to holsome pennance, &amp; when euen the faythfull the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues (O lamentable case) partly allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with sensuality, and partly quite transported with the torrent of euill custome, attend more then euer to wantonesse, feastinges, and banquets.</p>
               <p>These Nobles, being violently set vpon the same custome, and wholy enflamed with youthfull heate, while they remayned in <hi>Clareuallis,</hi> went seeking a fit place somewhat neere to the Church for their marshal sports and turneaments. The thing was much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing to the Abbot, wherefore with instance he prayed them for the present at least to desist from such exercises, and to make him a guift of those few dayes of Carneual. The vnbridled youths stopt their eares vnto so reasonable a request, remayning stiffe in their foolish purpose; then replyed the Saint: I trust in our Lord, he will graunt what you deny me. After this, calling for a cup of Wine, he first blessed it, &amp; then inuited the Gentlemen to pledge
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:12171:205"/>
him, and tast of it (which he called the wine of soules.) They all drunke cheerefully thereof, some few only excepted, who tooke the inuitation in ill part, for feare some hidden power, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment, as it were, might be in that wine, that might aliene their mindes from more gratefull and pleasant thinges. Nor was the suspition altogeather in vaine: for scarcely had they taken their leaue of the Abbot, and were gone out of the Monastery, when being touched and prickt with new inspirations, they began to discourse togeather of the continuall perills and foolish glory of the world. With which discourse they were so enflammed, as imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly without more adoe, they all agreed to returne to the cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and humbly demaunding admittance into Religion, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued there couragiously, enduring many labours with much fortitude and patience: a change surely worthy of much admiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but yet no lesse marueylous are these that follow.</p>
               <p>The Saint being once to make a peace of much importance, in going to <hi>Mentz</hi> a principall citty of Germany, the Archbishop of that Metropolis, vnderstanding of the approach of so great a man, sent a principall Clerke called <hi>Mascolin</hi> to meet him with honour, and to receaue him worthily on the way. This man arriuing to the presence of the Saint, and hauing reuerently declared to him how he came from his Lord the Archbishop to wayte vpon him, <hi>S. Bernard</hi> stopt, and fixing his eyes a while on the Clerke, sayd to him, he was sent by another Lord to serue him. The German was troubled at the answere, and not penetrating awhit what he meant thereby, affirmed againe, that he came being sent by the Metropolitan himselfe; the seruant of God on the contrary, reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: You deceaue your selfe, the Lord that sent you indeed, is yet greater then he, to wit, Christ himselfe. Then finally the good man vnderstanding what he aymed at: Your Paternity thinkes perhapes (replyed he) that I intend to be a Monke? God forbid the same as yet neuer came into my thought. Notwithstanding the Saint forbare not to rehearse againe, that by all meanes that must fall out which God hath disposed of him, and not what the Clerke himselfe hath thought, or not thought of. What more? He had not finished his iourney, but he resolued with himselfe to leaue the world, and a little after in company of many other honourable and learned men, gayned by the Saint in that iourney, he came to exchange his habit in the Monastery of <hi>Clareuallis.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:12171:205"/>
A more notable successe yet was that other of <hi>Henry</hi> brother of the King of France. This man being come to deale with the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Abbot, about certayne temporall affayres, the treaty being ended, desired the Monks might be assembled to salute them all together, and to recommend himselfe (as he did) vnto their prayers. With this occasion, that wise Pastour entred into some spirituall disourses with the Prince, and in the progresse of conuersation together among other things, he sayd to him: I hope Syr, you shal not dye in the state you are now in at this present; but that very soone you shall know by experience, how efficacious the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession is which you haue requested of these poore seruants of God. Nor was it long ere the prophesy was verifyed. On that very day through diuine inspiration, <hi>Henry</hi> did determine to follow by the streight way the stepps of Christ, &amp; without delay he put his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in effect: his family and the Nobles that accompanyed him thither, lamented him no lesse, then if that Royall youth had layne dead before them, and extended on a hearse.</p>
               <p>But among others on <hi>Andrew Parigino</hi> could by no meanes brooke it, being greatly affected to <hi>Henry.</hi> He was euen mad with anger, and seemed to let fall from his mouth curses, banninges, and all whatsoeuer greife and rage could suggest vnto him; when <hi>Henry</hi> on the other side (that yet loued him well) beganne earnestly to intreate the Saint, he would seeke aboue all others to conuert this man. To which <hi>S. Bernard</hi> answeared: Let vs let him alone for the present, for the poore man is now full of bitternes. Nor doe you take any thought thereat; I can assure you he is yours. With these wordes <hi>Henry</hi> being enflamed with new hope, and greater desire began to instance anew the blessed Father to delay no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to giue him the assault. Then <hi>S. Bernard</hi> replyed with a seuere countenance: What ayle you? Haue I not told you already, he his yours? The standers by hearing the discourse betwene them, and <hi>Andrew</hi> himselfe among the rest, who being obstinate in his ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners, and farre from changing his habit, and doing pennance, bowing downe his head (as he confessed afterwards) sayd within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to the Abbot: Now I see thee very well to be a false Prophet, I know for certaine thou hast sayd one thing, and the contrary will fall out: Go to, go to, let me come to the Court once, and on my credit, the King shall vnderstand of all, and I will make thy lyes appeare to the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:12171:206"/>
While this wretch makes these accounts alone with himselfe, they being in suspense, expected what would be the issue of the matter. When seeing him the day after to depart from thence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any thing done, the fayth and credit in some began to stagger, and the former conceipt which they had of the seruant of God: but our Lord permitted not the temptation to continue long; for that <hi>Andrew</hi> being now on his way, though his conscience began to sting him a little, yet for a while went he on cursing the Abbot, and Monastery, where he left his Maister, and wishing the whole <hi>Clareuallis</hi> might sinke, with as many as were in it. But these bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uado's and stiffnes of his lasted that day only; for being arriued to his lodging at night, he was so inwardly gauled with such stinges, as that being not able to resist any longer, without attending so much as till day, he leapt from his bed, and speedily returned backe to <hi>Clareuallis</hi> agayne, where deposing the old man, with his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted manners and fiercenes, he put on the new, to the great conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and wonder of all.</p>

               <p>IN those dayes certaine Flemings sped very well, who besides they were of a Noble bloud, and well learned, had likewise a great desire to attend to perfection, but could not well determine what schoole was fittest for their purpose; and in this suspense of mind stood wauering, vntill <hi>S.

And as his Name was now famous already, at the appearing of such a man, sprung a notable light in the mindes of those disconsolate louers of wisedome, so as without more delay they made choice of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of <hi>Clareuallis</hi> for Maister and Superiour, supposing he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stined thither by the diuine Prouidence for their saluation; selling and dispatching then ech one their busines, and laying aside the vayne designes, and deceiptfull hopes of the world, they went ioyfull with <hi>S.

               <p>It is an ordinary thing, likely in all beginners in the diuine ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and not yet experienced inough in desolation or substraction
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:12171:206"/>
of grace, and spirituall vicissitudes, when that gust of sensible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion comes once to faile them, and that pleasant light which puts them hastily on, to loose on a sudden all courage quite, and to fall into pusillanimity of spirit, and sadnes of hart. The occasion ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of do Wisemen say to be this: the Rationall substance cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to be straitned, and some delight eyther heauenly or terren must be. Now the soules, as being raysed aboue themselues, with some tast of supernall pleasures, do easily renounce the visible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects: so when through diuine dispensation, that ioy is taken away from them, finding themselues depriued of this also, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to expect with patience the returnes of the new Sunne, it seemes to them they are neither in heauen nor earth, and are as buryed in a perpetuall night; so as like babes hauing lost the breasts they languish and sigh, and become tedious, and irkesome chiefly to themselues.</p>
               <p>The same happened on they way to one of that company cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Gaufrid.</hi> This man being suddenly growne arid, and full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour darknes, began to bethinke himselfe of his freinds, parents, and goods, which he had left behind, and thereby was assayled with so strong a temptation, as being not able to dissemble it in his countenance, one of his more confident and intimate freinds was aware thereof, and dexterously approaching to him, with sweete and benigne speach in secret, sayd to him: What is the matter, <hi>Gaufrid?</hi> How happens this I pray you? go to, tell me, for it seemes to me you goe pensiue and sad, more then ordinary? Then <hi>Gaufrid</hi> answered with a deep sigh: Alas brother, I shall neuer be merry more in all my life. The other being with that word moued to pitty went suddenly, with fraternall zeale, to acquaint their common Father what passed, who vnderstanding the daunger, began to pray for him in a Church thereby, and <hi>Gaufrid</hi> in the meane while being ouercome with sadnes, reposed his head on a stone, and there fell a sleep: but long it was not ere both arose, the one from prayer with the grace obteyned, and the other from his sleep with a face so cheerefull and serene, as his freind much admiring at so sudayne and great a change, could not hold, but freindly vpbrayd him with what he had answered him a little before. Then <hi>Gaufrid</hi> sayd: if I told thee before, I should neuer be merry agayne, I now affirme <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> thee, I shall neuer be sad more. And this same <hi>Gaufrid</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, in the Nouiceship being desirous of the eternall saluation
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:12171:207"/>
of his owne Father, recommended him to the Saint with much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and confidence. And he sayd; doubt not, sonne, but thy Father shall be a good Religious man, and I my selfe after his death shall bury him with these armes: and so it fell out, that old man being entred into Religion, and growne very perfect in vertues, fell greiuously sick, at such tyme as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> was farre from <hi>Clareuallis,</hi> in which infirmity of his he grew dayly more sicke then other, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in extremity for some fiue monthes continually togeather, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Abbot returning, with his assistance he sweetly rendred vp his spirit in his armes, and with his owne handes buryed his body with his wonted Charity, and performing of due exequies.</p>
               <p>Another tyme, being gone to <hi>Chalon</hi> in <hi>Champayne</hi> to deale with the Bishop of that Citty, he thence lead with him at his returne a good number of excellent subiects: and such manner of purchase<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Besides which, there wanted not daily many, that being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured by his Name, and glutted with the deceipts of the world, came voluntary of their owne accord to submit themselues to the obedience of so great a guide. Whence no wonder is it, that from the garrison of <hi>Clareuallis,</hi> should be sent after (as we haue sayd) so fit supplyes, as there did, to so many partes of Europe.</p>

               <p>IT remaynes now to see, what manner the diuine man tooke in guiding and gouerning the Soules, recommended and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his care by the Prince of Pastours. It is then to be vnderstood, that in the first yeares of his Prelacy, in measuring others feruour by his owne, he was something more rigid and seuere, then good and moderate gouernement would seeme to beare. For that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of Nouices into the Conuent, he was wont to bid them (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other things) by way of Enigma, to leaue the body without, and to enter only with the spirit. Through which saying of his, some of the simpler of them, remayned so astonished, and terrified therewith, as they were after not able to vnderstand the sense and meaning of those wordes, though the Saint himselfe explayned the same. In the confessions which he heard of his Monks, with a bitter countenance he abhorred any manner of defect; esteeming euery
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:12171:207"/>
light fault in Religious, as a mortall sinne. In his Sermons, or as we say Homilyes rather, in the speculatiue, he often soared so high, as the hearers vnderstanding, would loose the sight of him: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steed of being fed and refreshed, would come to be dry and arid. And for the morall, he required so curious &amp; exact perfection of all, as the poore disciples, besides hope of gayning it, came to loose the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire &amp; will of procuring it.</p>
               <p>With these and other such proceedinges, the greater part of the Monkes, especially of the yonger of them were soone oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with a certaine sadnes and timidity withall, which both tooke away deuotion, and hindred their profit in solid vertues. Among which inconueniences was yet this good besides, that the Monks through the great opinion they had of their common Father, would lay the whole fault thereof, partly on their owne te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, and partly also on their poore wit, and small capacity, without euer once complayning of the Abbot, or opposing any thing which he sayd, or diminishing awhit the reuerence they bare him. It pleased God this humility of the subiects should get the vper hand vpon the Superiour: because, that he being lastly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and compunct in a manner at so much submission and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty of theirs, began to assume to himselfe the occasion of losse, and to say within himselfe. O <hi>Bernard,</hi> how much better were it for thee to attend to the amendement of thyne owne imperfections, then so to disquiet with too much seuerity and importune discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses the soules more timorous of God, and more religious then thee? Now, are not these seruants of Christ, better able to walke with their simplicity, then with thy indiscretion? And to learne much better the spirituall doctrine, in one only meditation, in dealing with the Highest Wisedome, then by all the preachinges and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations thou art able to make them? Learne then at last, that the Abbot <hi>Stephen</hi> hath layd a pack-sadle on an Oxes backe, &amp; that this gouerning of others is not thy talent.</p>
               <p>With these thoughtes, the man of God began to enter into so great a bitternes and hatred of his actions, as he determined to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre himselfe more then euer, and to abstaine from all pastorall functions, what possibly he might, vntill such tyme as had some cleere signe of the diuine will: nor was his expectation awhit in vaine, because it was not long, but there appeared to him by night a little child, cloathed all with eternall light, expressely comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:12171:208"/>
him, he should desist to propose vnto him, what his hart see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to dictate to him, since it was not he that spake to them, but the Holy Ghost discoursing by his mouth. And togeather with an inestimable guift, besides, of a sweet &amp; discreet maturity, whence he might learne to compassionate the weake, to temper himselfe to the capacity of the rude, and to condescend to ech what he might well do with the safety of Monasticall discipline.</p>
               <p>Heereupon the rigourous Abbot, in this point being chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as it were into another man, began with extraordinary ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes, and solicitude to preuent the necessityes of ech one, and not only of the soules, but euen also of the bodyes, prouiding as much as possibly he might, that euery one being free, and deliuered from temporall troubles and molestations, might attend with the whole mind to the purchase of vertues, and to the diuine seruice. Howsoeuer yet to himselfe only, and his owne person, the man of God, not altered awhit his former customes, for that indeed in him (as is signifyed already) the appetite was naturally much subiect to reason, and had no need through force of chastisements &amp; scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to reduce it to seruitude. Whence came the flesh to be a great deale more weakned in him, and afflicted with sundry infirmities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in so much as the Phisitians were astonished, how the Holy Abbot amidst so many dolours, could attend to occupations of any sort; and resembled him iust to a Lambe being put to the plough: &amp; he himselfe also at the latter end of his age, was finally aware thereof and accused himselfe for excesse of maceration of the body, and for destroying his complexion with austerityes, enfeebling the organ of the Holy Ghost, and consequently for hindering on his part the greater glory of the diuine goodnes.</p>
               <p>But for these new proceedings of his which we spake of, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be expressed, to what edification &amp; publique commodity they redounded. Because (which are the effects of knowne loue) there sprung very suddenly a noble strife and contention, betweene the fatherly indulgence of the Maister, and generous feruour of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, being all (for the most part) well descended; so as by how much he shewed himselfe to them to be a lesse strict exactour, so became they ordinarily more rigid censurers of themselues, exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themselues to the perfect obseruance of vowes and rule, not leauing a defect vnpunished, and holding the allurements and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticements of sensuality farre off from them. And the matter procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:12171:208"/>
so farre indeed, as not without some manifest perill of life, they went about in diuers kinds to take away all tast and relish of meate and drinke, as seeming to them a thing vnlawful, that he who hath layd vp his treasures and delights in heauen, should take any gust or pleasure in terrene things. And they were so rooted in such an opinion, as hardly with sundry examples and reasons, and with the authorityes of the sacred Scriptures themselues, could they be brought to vnderstand, that ech creature was good, being vsed in tyme and place, and with due moderation. Note this finally, they left that pernicious errour, but yet they wanted not matter of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification. First the diuine offices were celebrated with greatest at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and that for a good space of the day, and night. Moreouer the Monastery as yet not hauing any manner of rents, their holy pouerty was heere so much the more easy and familiar vnto them, as it was more straitly embraced and cherished of ech one. Heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reto was added the straitnes and incommodity of the dwelling, which while they sought to remedy, their continuall labour of the hands at certaine houres appointed, affoarded them no leasure for slouth and idlenes.</p>

               <p>AMong all the labours and trauailes of these blessed men, as there were many things of excellent example: yet was there none of greater edification to the beholders, then the continuall recollection and silence of so many seruants of God; so as, within the same habitation was ioyntly to be seene a noyse of a multitude, and a silence of a solitude, and that surely not without cause.

               <p>For eloquence, it was a thing in the blessed man more An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall then human, with so much sagacity would he discerne the peccant humours of men; with so much dexterity accommodated himselfe to their wits, docility, and manners. He would deale with the country people, as if he had continually been bred vp in a village: with the Nobles he kept all the points of good breeding: with the Ideots he would vse comparisons and conceipts of material and palpable things: with the learned and Sophisters he knew well in his tyme, to stand vpon subtilityes and acumens: and in summe had a great store and copious variety of bayts and hookes proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the gust, forces, and nature of ech one. To this so excellent prudence of his in practise, and so happy and rare a faculty of spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, was adioyned another guift and priuiledge, indeed not affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to many, to proue when need required his doctrine, with fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and great, and those euident Miracles. Whereof, besides what already hath been touched (not to go forth heere from our purpose) we shall discourse with our wonted breuity in its place.</p>
               <p>But with the ardent Charity of the Saint, we spake of, he gaue vs likewise a most cleere demonstration, in the sorrow and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion he felt for the peruersenes, and fault of his Neighbours, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of such as he had vnder his gouernement: which in so great diuersity of nations and temperatures, may not seeme very strange that some disorder now and then should fall out; and that so much the rather, as the Religious state supposeth men not allready to be perfect, but studious, and (so we may euen say) scholers of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, in as much as ech discipline and art (as the Philospher sayd) is in erring learned. In such occurrences then, the good Prelate, though touched in the soule with the sharpest stings: yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse with familiar countenance and paternall grauity withall; would not hold in secret from rebuking the delinquent; who co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming heereby to acknowledge the fault, and to shew forth true pennance, the man of God contented with the humble satisfaction, would comfort him, and proceed no further. And when the guilty shewed himselfe stiffe, and gaue a harsh answeare, he would sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:12171:209"/>
cease to striue or contend with him, not to put in some sort his pastorall authority in daunger. But leauing to the disciple new space to acknowledge his errour, with occasion he would returne agayne afterwardes to the same office of louing correction; or else when necessity required, he would betake himselfe to the counsel of the Scripture, which aduiseth, the foolish man not to be corrected with wordes. And when this last remedy at any tyme proued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, it cannot be expressed what affliction and corrasiue the blessed Soule, would take thereat.</p>
               <p>And if any perhappes should wish him not to grieue so much at it, since he had fully satisfyed his duty in the sight of God, &amp; that he could by no meanes doe any more with one that through obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacy would needes perish; the amorous Rectour would answere sighing, how these nor infinite reasons could quiet him, in behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him as dead before his eyes whome he loued so much: &amp; you would haue me (sayth he) to feele no griefe at so ill successe, as if in this reprehension and rebuke, I had for scope only the sauing of myne owne soule, and not rather the saluation also of that of my beloued? And what Mother is there, that howbeit on her part she haue vsed all care and diligence in her childs infirmity, if she see it dead, who can choose but lament and bewayle the same, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the while the paines she hath taken for it in vaine?</p>
               <p>Such then were the bowells of this true follower of Christ, whence it would happen likewise, that if he had denyed any thing at the first to any indiscreet and importunate suiter, he could by no meanes deny him the second tyme. Forasmuch as euen by naturall instinct, his hart would not serue him to behould any one contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state and afflicted, so as he neuer despised or made light reckoning of the trouble and perturbation of any one tempted: and how beit in its tyme he could shew, that he sought rather the pleasure of God, then that of men, and preferred truth and iustice before any other respect whatsoeuer; yet did he all with such regard, and so much circumspection, as euen to such as seemed offended with him there wanted not matter to remaine well satisfyed. Whence sometymes it happened, that such as these would become afterwardes more deuoute, and affected to the man of God, then euer.</p>

               <p>After the enterprise of <hi>Sozia,</hi> which vnder the conduct of <hi>Lewes</hi> King of France, through wicked perfidiousnes of the Grecian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, had taken but ill successe, there were some that traduced the fame of <hi>S.

Whereunto being not able to giue a particuler account to euery one of his motiues, and of what had passed in the voyage, at least he prayed often for them all, being a great deale more sorrowful for their sinne, then for his proper infamy: &amp; being not able to suppresse such murmurs reioyced at least, that those poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonous shafts of the slanderous ignorant, were aymed all at him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe (who did little respect them,) and much reioyced that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maiesty and Prouidence, was come to be entire, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched by those impious people.</p>
               <p>There were once 600. markes of siluer intercepted by the way from the seruants of the man of God, being magnificently assigned by the Abbot of <hi>Farco,</hi> to the behoofe and benefit of the Order. To which newes the Saint replyed with a cheerefull countenance: Blessed be God who hath deliuered vs from such a burthen: and he truly who hath taken away the money, in some sort deserues to be excused, since such a summe might well giue a shrewd temptation. The same tenour he kept of a serene mind, without contention, or strife at all, when there were taken from him, partly through de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and partly by force about some ten Monasteries, or places at least very apt to erect foundations for them.</p>

Why haue you then (replyed the wretch) Father, so extolled Perfection in your writinges, if you will not succour and help him, who desires the same? And being vrged by the infernal spirit, added: Now then if I had those books in my hands, I would surely rent them in a thousand peeces. To this, the Man of God answered: I do verily thinke, sayd he, that in
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:12171:211"/>
none of them thou shalt find, Thou mayst not be perfect in thy cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster: the amendement of manners, change not of places (if I well remember) I haue proposed, and commended in my bookes. Then went that frantique man quite out of his wits, and lifting vp sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly his most sacrilegious hand, he gaue so huge a cuffe on the eare to the holy Abbot, that his cheeke was presently swolne: wherat with reason the standers by being incensed began to rise vp to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the Wretch as he deserued; but soone the Seruant of God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented the same, exclayming and coniuring them by the name of Christ, not to touch him, but warily to lead him away, procuring by all meanes possible, he should take no harme. And thus the wretch all pale, and trembling escaped thence without the least punishment. Moreouer this defendour of the Truth, and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the diuine seruice, wanted not his emulous, and persecutours, though he, through the eminence of his qualityes, and glory of his wordes and deedes, had very much ouercome their enuy.</p>
               <p>With such a pest of men, the Iouer of Christ vsed this manner of proceeding: first according to the precept of the Ghospell, he would make feruent prayer for them; after that with might and mayne he sought to extingnish that malignant passion with all manner of submission, and good offices; in rendering benefits for iniuryes, honour and reuerence, for contempt and affronts, as he who had their saluation as deere as his owne, and felt particuler torment, at the scandall of those, to whome he had giuen no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion at all: and the malice of others did excruciate him more, then his conscience seemed to satisfy him, it seeming a matter too diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for him to cure a malady, whose origine he could not disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: and whensoeuer he was able to come to the knowledge ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he tooke no greater pleasure then to roote it out, although he were thereby to haue his handes all mangled and bloudy.</p>
               <p>The most holy Abbot was ariued to such a point of the loue of God, and of his Neighbour, through the continuall meditation of the life and passion of Christ, being truly become the forme and example of the flocke, which he had in charge, as that now with great reason was the good odour of <hi>Clareuallis</hi> spread, and dilated through out all Christendome; and in all partes (as we sayd aboue) with cost and diligence were the grafts of this happy plant both craued, and procured; nor were there only Monasteryes of S. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> founded heere and there, but euen whole Conuents likewise
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:12171:211"/>
of other families, came voluntarily to submit themselues vnto his obedience, and to conforme themselues with all study to the rites and profession of the <hi>Cisterce,</hi> yea euen he himselfe whose princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall care was (as we sayd) to remaine hidden and vnknowne in that corner, and valley, was yet very suddenly more highly placed by the diuine hand, in the light, and sight of men, and obliged to dispense to the benefit of the world, the treasures and graces which he heaped vp togeather in his Cell.

               <p>In these and other actions, the Pope would neuer suffer the glorious Abbot of <hi>Clareuallis</hi> to depart from his side, yea diuers sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of moment were presented vnto him, and he would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes propose them in the consistory, where <hi>S.

                  <hi>Innocent</hi> with his whole Court being strooken with so harsh a proposition and so vnexpected, grew pale thereat, and stood as a man wholy voyd of counsayle, as seeming to him he met in <hi>Liege</hi> with a greater checke, then formerly in <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe: when the venerable Abbot with freedome of mind and meruaylous liberty counterposed himselfe as a solid wall to the demaund &amp; pretension

Because the Anti-pope being obdurate in malice, and continually accompanyed with armed men, kept himselfe in hold, and all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes well fortifyed in Towers, and more eminent places of the Citty: from whence with sudden incursions and stratagems with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out euer entring into open battaile, or once seeking to come to a parley with <hi>Lotharius,</hi> he neuer left infesting both day and night the freinds and defenders of the Pope.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the Emperour being now growne weary of the excesse, charge, and small fruite, returned into <hi>Almany</hi> agayne: and
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:12171:213"/>
                  <hi>Innocent</hi> fynding no better remedy for so great mischeifes, went out of <hi>Rome</hi> the second tyme, and assembling togeather another so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne Councel in the Citty of <hi>Pisa,</hi> among other things publiquely declared <hi>Pierlonio</hi> excommunicate: of which censure, the miserable man was neuer absolued. Heere also S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> through obedience assisted the cheife Bishop, and was not only a helper and partaker of the whole affayres and counsells therein, but may be sayd more an arbiter and vmpier in the busynes. Which affayres being once dispatched, it seemed good to the Pope to send him to <hi>Millan,</hi> where the poyson of the Anti-pope hauing got in, the whole people were found to be in a most inextricable trouble and discord among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. Nor was heere likewise the arriuall of the man of God in vayne. He soone reunited the whole Citty agayne, and reduced it to the deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the true Pope. From hence passing ouer the Alpes, he returned to <hi>Clareuallis,</hi> and being receaued by the Monks there with infinite iubiley, at their instance transferred he the Monastery into a more ample situation; wherof the fame being spread through out, there immediatly concurred so great almes from Princes and Prelates, and from other deuout persons, as in very short space, the building adorned withall commodityes was brought to perfection to the great increase of the diuine seruice.</p>
               <p>At the same tyme the Country of <hi>Gascony,</hi> and especially the Church of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> was fallen as it were into some afflictions and calamityes, from whence the citty of <hi>Milan</hi> had beene deliuered but a little before.

But only required, they might passe by the way of <hi>Nantes,</hi> where <hi>Ermengarda</hi> the Countesse had founded a Conuent of his Monks, and it was necessary for him to passe that way, to giue order (as he would quickly doe) to the affayres belonging to the sayd Monastery. <hi>Gaufrid</hi> and <hi>S.

               </p>
               <p>Now the Count vnderstanding of the comming of the Bishop of <hi>Chartres,</hi> and of the Blessed <hi>Bernard,</hi> as also of other Bishops and Religious with him, to treate with him in the affaires of Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall matters, he thought it not fit for many respects to refuse that parly. They were all then assembled togeather by agreement in a place which was named <hi>Pertinaco,</hi> whereby the Seruants of God had fit oportunity to expresse their mindes to the full, and it was
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:12171:214"/>
proposed (among other thinges) how vnseemely it was, that all France being now at the deuotion of Pope <hi>Innocent, Gascony</hi> should only diuide her selfe from the common communion and accord, &amp; cause so great, and so miserable a separation and defection in the people of God: how he could not but know, that the Church of Christ is but one only, and whatsoeuer out of it, as found out of the Arke of <hi>Noe,</hi> must of necessity sincke and perish. They likewise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to his memory the dreadfull euent of <hi>Dathan</hi> &amp; <hi>Abiron,</hi> who for no other cause, then for making disunion, were swallowed vp aliue in the earth. To this they added other examples of manifest vengeance and wrath of God against seditious persons and Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiques. Count <hi>VVilliam</hi> being moued with these exhortations &amp; menaces, partly became flexible thereunto, offering himselfe to accept <hi>Innocent</hi> for lawfull Pope; and partly shewed himselfe obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and hard, being not willing by any meanes to restore the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Bishops againe so violently deposed, and sent into banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that not so much through occasion of the publique cause, as for some particuler grudges which he had against them.</p>
               <p>This article was disputed a good while in two assemblyes, &amp; the second tyme S. <hi>Bernard</hi> perceauing, that nothing could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by way of wordes, he straight recurred to more efficacious and potent meanes, as in such occasions he was wont to do. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore breaking off the discourse, he goes directly to the Altar, and prepares himselfe for Masse. Those only entred in, who were not forbid to assist at that dreadfull sacrifice, while the Count with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers being seuered from the Catholike communion, stood without at the gate. When he Priest of God, hauing finished the whole consecration, and giuen the Pax to the people, not now as a man, but as one of the spirits of the heauenly squadron, holding the most holy Sacrament ouer the Paten with flaming countenance and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning eyes, not with a supplant visage, but with a power more then humane, going forth of the Temple, with a terrible voyce, thus thundred to the Count: Haue we not intreated you, and you des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pised vs? Besides, haue not this multitude of Gods seruants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iured thee, and yet hast thou made no account thereof? Behold the Virgins sonne is come into thy sight, being the head and Lord of the Church which thou dost persecute. Behould thy Iudge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whose handes that soule of thyne is sure to fall. And now wilt thou seeme to contemne him like wise? Wilt thou also affront his
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:12171:215"/>
his person, as thou hast his Seruantes?</p>
               <p>At such a sight, and such words withal, the standers by being astonished and much amazed, began to inuocate the diuine suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours: but the Count himselfe perceauing the Priest to come tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes him with the most sacred body of Christ in his hand, being ful of sudden horrour and trembling, fell flat to the ground, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently raysed vp by his Guard, fell downe againe, with quiuering nerues, without speaking a word, or lifting vp the eyes: but only with deep sighes, by the mouth and beard he put forth both foame &amp; spittle, as he had been in a Epilepsy. Then the Seruant of Christ approaching vnto him, and touching him with his foot, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to stand vp, and heare the diuine Sentence, in the tenour following: Let the Bishop of <hi>Poytiers</hi> come hither into this place, whome thou hast banished from his Sea: Goe thy wayes to him, &amp; with the holy kisse hauing giuen the peace, doe thou thy selfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store him againe into his Church, &amp; satisfying our Lord God, giue honour to the good Prelate for the iniuries &amp; affro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts thou hast done him. Moreouer in thy whole dominion do thou then regather and recall againe into a true vnion all those who are now in discord &amp; diuision: Submit thy selfe to Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> &amp; as the other are obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to him, so do thou also affoard due obedience to his Holynes, elected by the diuine Maiesty.</p>
               <p>The Count hearing this, and being conuinced and confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as well through the worke of the holy Ghost, as with the presence of the sacred mysteries, he neyther could, nor durst an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere a word, but seeing the Bishop of <hi>Poytiers</hi> present, went speedily to salute him, and receaue him with imbraces and signes of loue and peace, and without delay conducted him, and restored him to his Episcopall seate againe, with the same hand wherewith he had deposed him, and thrust him out. After this the holy Abbot oftentymes looked more sweetly &amp; more familiarly on the Count, aduising him to beware henceforth of so impious and temerarious actions, and neuer more to prouoke the anger of God. Nor were the admonitions cast into the wind, since that Prince not only ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stayned for euer after from troubling the Ecclesiasticall vnion and tranquility, but euen rather in processe of tyme, arriued to the termes of most excellent vertue &amp; Christian charity, as the things that are written of him do sufficiently declare.</p>
               <p>In this manner were matters in <hi>Gascony</hi> well pacifyed, saue
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:12171:215"/>
only the Bishop of <hi>Angolesme</hi> continued still fixed in malice. Who yet soone after, through the iust iudgement of God was found dead one morning in his bed, with a terrible swelling, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and the last rites. And though for that tyme, through the help of his deerest friends he was buryed in the Church, yet after notwithstanding by order of the Bishop of <hi>Chartres,</hi> were his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable bones taken out of the sepulcher, &amp; cast forth to the fowles of the ayre, and the rauenous beasts. Nor ceased heere the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for as much as euen his Nephewes also with the whole race and kindred of the sayd deceased, being afterwardes banished out their countrey, went wandring into diuers partes, infamous and miserable.</p>

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:12171:216"/>
forth deep sighs and sobs from his breast, at last tooke his leaue of them in this manner: You see, Brethren, into how great disorders, and tribulations the Church of God is now brought. And to say truly, the followers of <hi>Pierlonio</hi> are now, as it were throughout, by the diuine grace pulled away from that feygned Head, and so pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous a sect. And euen in <hi>Rome</hi> also a great part of the Cleargy &amp; Nobility in their harts do follow <hi>Innocent,</hi> though otherwise throgh feare of some more potent, and of the common people withall corrupted by the Antipope, they dare not openly shew forth what they haue more secretly layd vp in their breasts. So as the West being now subdued, we may say, there remaines but one Nation only to be vanquished and ouercome: if you make but prayer with spirituall Iubily, <hi>Iericho</hi> shall euen fall to the ground, and you but lifting vp your handes with <hi>Moyses, Amalech</hi> be put to flight. <hi>Iosua</hi> victorious in the battaile, to haue full space of a complete victory very bloudy, commands the Sunne to stay its course, and is obeyed. And you likewise seeing vs, in the heate of the battaile, cease you not to affoard vs your ayde and succour with feruent prayers: and in the meane tyme, be you firme in the way begun, and holy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses made; and howbeit in your selues, you be not conscious of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great cryme, yet beware you esteeme not your selues in your owne iudgement to be innocent and iust, since to iustify, and iudge the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science, appertaines to God only: yea, by how much a man is more forward in perfection, so much the lesse presumes he of the strait &amp; rigourous account of the diuine iustice. On the other side make you no reckoning of humane iudgements, eyther of your selues or others, but so keep you vnder the feare of God, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you, in iudging by him, come to dash vpon some rocke of pride or vanity. You are to attend to an exact and continuall search into your selues, and of your selues; which doing, yet shall you alwaies repute your selues to be vnprofitable seruants, as our Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. It behoues me to go, whither the chiefe Pastour appoints me; and since all this trauaile is vndertaken by me, purely for the seruice and glory of the diuine goodnes, I shall not fayle to beseech the same with much confidence, to take you into his custody and protection.</p>
               <p>After these words, being accompanyed with aboundance of teares and deuout desires of that pious congregation, he puts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe on the way towardes <hi>Rome,</hi> and being receaued, whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer

               <p>FRom these errours S. <hi>Bernard</hi> did endeauour, and not without fruite, to deliuer that blind people, when the Embassadours of <hi>Roger</hi> King of Sicily arriued at <hi>Rome,</hi> who with a dissembling zeale of the common good, made shew of being desirous to enforme himselfe fully of the truth, and to become arbiter of so great and pertinacious discords, though in secret (as we sayd) he were held to be a fautour, of the peruerse faction, and therefore craftily requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Anaclet,</hi> to send him <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Pisa,</hi> a most wise and eloquent man on his behalfe, and made instance to <hi>Innocent</hi> for the Abbot of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuallis,</hi> that these two as aduocates being to argue and plead in his presence, might giue him true notice of all, hoping by this meanes the lowlynes and simplicity of one poore Monke might be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne and opprest, through the eloquence and cunning of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Doctour.</p>
               <p>The sayd King was very potent, and was at that tyme with a puissant army in the kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> so as the Embassadours had no great difficulty to obtayne at <hi>Rome</hi> what they would. But through diuine disposition the matter had a farre different euent from that which the King thought of. Because that <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Bernard</hi> being arriued at his Court, after they had discoursed apart with him, and the principall Officers, there was finally deputed a certaine day to both the Procuratours togeather for publique au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:12171:217"/>
Now what successe was to follow of this duell, a certaine battayle fought betweene the sayd King, and the Duke <hi>Ranulphus,</hi> who was a Prince, and a very vertuous Catholike, gaue no small demonstration at that tyme. S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> with Charity had ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured to hinder the sayd conflict, and to make peace betweene the two Christian armyes; and to <hi>Roger</hi> had manifestly threatned and foretold, that if he fought he should loose the battayle. But he finding himselfe to haue much odds, and aduantage ouer <hi>Ranulphus</hi> in number and forces, with haughtynes and pride contemning the aduises and protestations of the man of God, would needs by all meanes encounter and set vpon him, neer vnto the Citty of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerno:</hi> where, with the astonishment of all, there suddenly entring a feare into the campe, he was vanquished by the Dukes army, routed, and put to flight. And yet notwithstanding hauing reas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled together the vnhappy remainder, and with new succours made vp a Royall army agayne; he presents himselfe in Councell and Tribunall on the day assigned for the dispute, hauing first in priuate, with great promises and large offers set the Pisan Doctour on fire to purchase himselfe honour, in sustayning the cause of Pope <hi>Anaclete,</hi> and in that assembly of noble and learned men to stop the mouth of the French Abbot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> then full of vayne hopes, and of high thoughts, appeared in the Court, where with much eloquence, and great memory and art, depainting forth first the fact, with handsome coulours, then alleadging and interpreting in his manner the decrees and Canons, he endeuoured to proue how the election of <hi>Anaclete</hi> had been most sincere and legitimate. On the contrary the holy man hauing heard the Oratour with much patience, began his discourse with great humility and modesty, and by little and little grew into so great vehemency and liberty of heauenly spirit, and with such pregnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of reasons, and weight of Scriptures, and variety of examples, and comparisons, so defeated the foundations, and discouered the falshoods of the aduersary, as not only almost all the auditory then remained perswaded, but euen the Aduocate <hi>Anaclete</hi> himselfe of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conuinced with the truth, and returned to himselfe, repented he had euer vndertaken the protection of the wicked and false Pope; and being afterwards further assisted with the priuate exhortations of the seruant of Christ, fayled not to reconcile himselfe to <hi>Innocent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Roger,</hi> how beit he could now pretend no ignorance, yet
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:12171:217"/>
being ouerwhelmed with diuers passions, could neuer be brought to the sayd demonstrations and acts, which in a matter of so great importance ought publiquely to be done. Whence S. <hi>Bernard</hi> being satisfyed with his owne conscience, and remitting the rest to the diuine Iustice, returned back to <hi>Rome,</hi> and renewed agayne the interrupted labour of reducing the soules to the obedience of the Pope, &amp; vnion of the Church, which till that time had been eyther seduced through opinion, or enchayned by malice. For so great a hurt and notorious a scandal, <hi>S. Bernard</hi> was exceedingly afflicted: but it pleased the diuine goodnes soone to deliuer him from that greife through the death of <hi>Pierlonio:</hi> who being seized with a pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent malady, though he had three dayes space, to acknowledge his offences, yet obdurate &amp; impenitent, he passed to render accompt to the eternall Iudge of his misdeed.</p>
               <p>Being dead, his followers did presently substitute, and set vp an other Anti-pope, who yet being conscious of his owne weakenes, and the dangers which hung ouer his head; went by night to seeke out S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> who hauing louingly reprehended him, and made him to lay downe the ornaments vsurped, led him with his owne hands to the feete of <hi>Innocent,</hi> from whom benignly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing absolution, he was admitted into grace.

                  <hi>S. Bernard</hi> refutes and confounds <hi>Abaylard,</hi> a famous Heretike: with other heresyes arising at that tyme. <hi>Chap.</hi> 18.</head>
               <p>THere flourished in those dayes, with great fame of much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, one <hi>Peter Abaylard,</hi> a person of an exceeding sharpe wit, but proud and haughty withall. This man (as it happens often with the proud) being deceaued by the Father of lying; began to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perse writings, full of new doctrine, and of pestiferous opinions: wherof S. <hi>Bernard</hi> hauing notice, through his accustomed goodnes and benignity, performed the office towards him of fraternall cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; endeuouring that without preiudice and infamy of the writer, those blasphemyes might be amended. And truly <hi>Peter</hi> himselfe for the present, through the words and Charity of the Saint shewed himselfe to be so changed and compunct, as he promised to remit al to his censure and correction. But a little after, being vanquished through the blind loue &amp; vaine persuasion of himselfe, he not only brake his word, but euen also taking his aduantage of the tyme, he went to the Bishop of <hi>Sans,</hi> in whose Church was presently a great Councell assembled, and before him very insolently complayned of the Abbot of <hi>Clareuallis,</hi> as of a slaunderer, and detractour, and made instance, the Councell being opened he might be cyted to yield account of the obiections and calumnies giuen out against his bookes, shewing himselfe to be prompt and ready to defend in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique whatsoeuer was contayned therin. Nor did the Bishop re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse him: the tyme being come, he cites the Man of God to the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod to iustify the sayd oppositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. There came likewise thither <hi>Peter</hi> full of pride, founding himselfe in sillogismes, and his dialectical art: but well it appeares how vayne human meanes are against the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine power. Because, the designed day being come for discussion of those articles, S. <hi>Bernard</hi> in the presence of all those venerable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and Doctours, produced the volumes of <hi>Abaylard,</hi> and with
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:12171:219"/>
very strong reasons and cleere testimonyes of Scripture and holy Fathers, went manifesting and refuting one by one, all the proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which digressed from fayth, and the Apostolique traditions. And such was the spirit, which in that Session also spake in the mouth of S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> as that <hi>Abaylard</hi> loosing in a moment his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory and discourse, full of shame and confusion with the wonder of all was strooken dumbe. There was giuen him space notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and election, eyther to deny those writings, or humbly to amend himselfe, or els to answere (if he coud) to the obiections made. But he very hard to repent himselfe, to gaine (as they say) more tyme, resolued with himselfe to appeale to the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> howbeit, that sacred Congregation stucke not to reproue the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, though forbore the person: and a little after came the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Pope, which declaring <hi>Abaylard</hi> to be a manifest here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike, condemned him to silence, and his workes to the fire.</p>
               <p>This disorder being thus remedyed, after some yeares againe there appeared another, through the fault of <hi>VVilliam Perretta</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Poytiers,</hi> a man much versed in the diuine Scriptures, but temerarious &amp; arrogant, in so much as he had the boldnes to medle with the mystery of the most holy Trinity, with many capriches &amp; subtlityes neuer heard of before, and that with so much the greater common perill, as he was more pregnant and dexterous, to couer the senses with artificious and obscure wordes; in such sort, as the poyson had much spread it selfe before any could easily perceaue it. To these snares S. <hi>Bernard</hi> did most valorously oppose himselfe in the Councell of <hi>Rhemes</hi> celebrated by Pope <hi>Eugenius,</hi> wherein dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting continually for two dayes togeather against those impious dogma's, what with quoating and comparing places one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other dispersed and disioyned heere and there, with determining of equiuocations, distinguishing ambiguityes, inserting of conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and deducing of corolaryes; he draue out of darknes &amp; caues, that whole antiquity, and exposed it so to the light, as there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned no more any place for doubt.</p>
               <p>And because notwithstanding all this diligence, some fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of <hi>VVilliam</hi> hindred that the processe could not he finished a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him; <hi>S. Bernard</hi> with his great authority, caused a congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be assembled of purpose, where with the consent and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the Fathers of ten Prouinces, and of very many Bishops and Abbots, he framed, and added a new symbole, as opposite to
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:12171:220"/>
the noueltyes of <hi>VVilliam,</hi> &amp; with such means very easily wrought that these peruerse opinions should be vtterly prohibited, though no chastisement otherwise were inflicted on the Authour, since he was in the mind to enter into that dispute with this condition and protestation, that in case his sayinges were not excepted and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the sacred Councell, he would be ready without pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city at all, to reuoke them quite, and so being demanded if he gaue his consent to the sayd condemnation, answered: Yea, and in full session retracting and detesting the etrours, he obtayned mercy.</p>
               <p>No lesse horrible and pernicious, about the same yeares, was the impiety of a certaine Precursour of <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> called <hi>Henry,</hi> a most vile Apostata also, and euen possessed wholy with the like spirit of blasphemy; so as he doubted not to open his sacrilegious mouth against heauen, to discouer himselfe to be the enemy of Christ, to assaile, and to his power to destroy the Sacramentes and Ordinations, and the ancient rites of the ecclesiasticall Hierarchy. And as he had a good tongue, and knew well how to handle the people, and entice men to licencious liberty, he made such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse in some parts of <hi>Gascony,</hi> as now at last heere and there were Pastours to be seene without flockes, people without Priestes, Priests without due veneration, &amp; finally Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s without Christ himselfe. To children there was none to open the gate of holy Baptisme; the offeringes and suffrages of the dead were come into derision; the inuocation of Saintes, Excommunications, Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, the building of Churches, the keeping of Fasts, the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of Oyle, and summarily all the institutes and traditions of the Apostolike discipline were had in great despite and abominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>At such vnhappy newes, a Legat being sent from <hi>Rome</hi> to those partes, in passing by <hi>Clareuallis,</hi> lead <hi>S.

               <p>FRom such paynes and trauailes, suffered by the Labourer of Christ, in curing and recouering of Heretikes, may euery one imagine how much care and study he employed in preseruing and helping Catholikes. So as, it would be ouer long and tedious to recount how many great Princes, and other persons of ech state &amp; quality, he instructed with great patience in Christian vertues, and from the vanityes of the world conuerted to the loue of heauenly thinges. How many Churches at variance and discord with their Pastours, how many Chapters and Colledges not without most grieuous scandall disunited from their head and in themselues, with his sweetnes and authority hath he reduced to peace and amity? To how many afflicted and distressed soules hath he giuen counsayle, succour, and comfort? How many fires already kindled of open warre betweene mighty Lords, and neighbour-people with like zeale and prudence hath he extinguished?</p>
               <p>To which purpose, we are by no meanes to passe ouer in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, the accord which he concluded with so great trauaile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the inhabitants of <hi>Mets</hi> in <hi>Lorayn,</hi> and some Neighbour-Princes thereabouts, by whom that noble Citty being prouoked with some iniuryes, sent forth to reuenge the same a great number of Citizens in armes, but with ill successe, because they being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken on the sudden through the exceeding disaduantage of the place betweene the straits of <hi>Montefred</hi> and <hi>Mosella</hi> a famous riuer, &amp; assai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the enemy, though inferiour in number, and put to flight, were about two thousand of them lost, partly by sword, partly in the waters, partly also by their owne confusion smoothered and crushed to death in the presse. Whence the Princes on the other side being rich with the spoiles, and proud of the victory, returned home with triumph. Nor yet lost the citty a whit of courage, while
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:12171:221"/>
they seemed to be va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quished more through inequality of the place, then by the valour and skill of the aduersaries.</p>
               <p>They prepared then anew on all sides, and doubtles there hung a cruell mortality, and a miserable wast ouer all those countryes. When the Metropolitan Archbishop of <hi>Treuers,</hi> for the fatherly care &amp; sollicitude he had of his people, after he had tryed many meanes in vayne, he recurred for the last refuge to S. <hi>Bernard</hi> the great ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of Christ; and being come to <hi>Clareuallis</hi> in person, prostrating himselfe very humbly at the feete not only of him, but of all the Monks also, besought &amp; coniured him withall to vouchsafe to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply some remedy to so great mischeifs and euills, since for such an office of piety in the world besides, was no other person found to be sufficient.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Bernard</hi> at that tyme approached neere to the end of his dayes and being ouercharged as well with old age, as infirmityes, kept his bed; yet notwithstanding most benignly promised his help, and (as we haue sayd aboue, is wont to happen in like cases) his forces being suddainly recouered for this affayre, he went his wayes in company of the Archbishop. When they arriued, they found the two opposite armyes, who attending on the banck side of the riuer, were expecting an occasion to come to a fresh battayle.</p>
               <p>From so great a hazard, and so much hurt, sought S. <hi>Bernard</hi> with prayers and exhortations to deliuer the Christian armies, but wordes auayling litle, with the efficacious force of stupendious mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, he filled those fierce and obdurate harts with such religion and horrour, as being finally mollifyed like wax, were all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersyes by common consent remitted to the arbitrement of the man of God. Whereupon he hauing brought the Procuratour of ech part vnder publique safe conduct, to a Parley in an iland of the Riuer, hauing now well vnderstood the beginning of the strifes betwene them, prescribed them conditions and articles of peace; the which without rigour were accepted, and in signe of accord, the Procuratours gaue ech other their hands, with louing imbraces, and those dark cloudes, and dreadfull lightnings of warre, were soone turned into a goodly calme of tranquility and concord.</p>
               <p>And since we haue already often made mention of Miracles of the Saint, and sometymes also according to occurrences declared some of them; you must vnderstand, this matter affoards an infinite store of narrations: forasmuch as among other Authours the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

Neuerthelesse there remaynes yet a faythfull and distinct memory of so many of them, as to goe about to set them heere downe one by one, would be a thing too prolix and far off from our scope. We therefore making choyce (according to out custome) of the more notable and of greater edification, shall reduce them to fiue heads; that is, to the grace of Cures; to power vpon deuills; to visions or apparitions; to the spirit of Prophesy; and to efficacy of prayer: which, though indeed it may be sayd, to run through all the other species, notwithstanding for that it wants not proprietyes also of its owne, we haue thought good to put it downe by it selfe a part; yea &amp; taking beginning from thence, we shall tell what happened to <hi>S.

But behold the hoast being receiued into his mouth, he could by no meanes

               <p>S. <hi>Bernard</hi> in the Court of the yong King <hi>Lewes,</hi> negotiated a peace of moment, and secretly had the <hi>Queene</hi> his opposit therein though otherwise openly she shewed her selfe to be deuoted to him.

This Lady was held to be barren, hauing now liued many yeares with her husband without issue, for which she with the whole Court, was exceedingly afflicted. Now she one day with the holy Abbot lamenting her selfe for such a disaster, with this opportunity he fayld not to aduise her, that if she would be comforted in her desire, she should cease to hinder the peace in treaty: which she did, and soone after the accord very happily succeeded. Then <hi>Lewes</hi> through suggestion of his wife, put <hi>S.

That effect also was held very memorable, which now we shall tell.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Bernard</hi> being ready to depart the second tyme from <hi>Rome,</hi> procured with the Popes consent, some Relikes of Saints to carry with him; and visiting Churches for that end, he was offered by the <hi>Grecian</hi> Monks the entire head of S. <hi>Caesarius</hi> Martyr. But he of innated modesty, hauing respect as not willing to depriue those Religious of so noble a treasure, was content to accept as a fauour one tooth only. The Monks then endeauour to pull it forth, and being not able with their hands, they brake two kniues about it, without profitting a whit: it is fit (sayd S. <hi>Bernard)</hi> we pray to the glorious Martyr, he would vouchsafe to doe vs this fauour: he prayed vnto him, and after reuerently approaching to the sacred skull, without any difficulty he tooke out one, with two of his fingars, which before could not be stirred with the force of instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

               <p>Heere then besides many other signes, wrought through diuine power by meanes of this feruent Labourer: one morning as he was
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:12171:224"/>
celebrating Masse in the Church of S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> with an exceeding great concourse of people, there was presented to him by her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents a little Girle of tender age, in whome the Diuell most tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically raigned, and he was prayed with great instance to take pitty of that vnhappy Wretch, and deliuer her from so cruell torments, which appeared by the shreekes and cryes she gaue, and in her cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and in all the partes of her body, with the exceeding hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the standers by. The tender hart of the good Priest was moued with these prayers, and such a spectacle: who sitting neere to the Altar, while the Quire was singing, called for the Patten whereon he was to make the Offertory, and with his fingar distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling some droppes of water thereon, he gaue it to the possessed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to drinke, and immediatly the Diuell not able to suffer that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Antidote, and that blessed effusion, by meanes of a foule and nauseous vomit, very hastily departed, and the Girle with infinit applause and admiration of the people was restored to her Parents safe and secure.</p>
               <p>After this, vpon another day, in the selfe same place &amp; houre, was a gentlewoman of mature age brought thither by many with mayne strength, in whose breast now for many yeares Sathan had remayned, and so disfigured and deformed her, as that being depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of hearing, sight, and speach, in putting forth the tongue, like an Elephants truncke seemed rather a Monster then a woman; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides which, the face all soyled and vgly to see, with a stincking breath withal, shewed well the quality of the Ghest that kept pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session. Being brought then into the presence of the Saint, he knew at first sight, through diuine permission, that enemy was of an euill and cruell race, and so inueterate and settled in her, as he would not easily be got forth of so gratefull, and so ancient a dominion. Then the seruant of Christ, turning to the people which were there in great number, bad them all to pray very attentiuely, &amp; commanded the Clerkes to hold the Woman there as firme and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable as they could: but she with diuellish force resisting and kicking withall, with her foot came to strike the Priest himselfe, who not regarding the same, entred into the consecration in such manner, as looke how many signes of the Crosse he made vpon the hoast, so many in turning himselfe he made vpon the possessed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, with the incredible rage, and dolour of that fiend, as by the gnashing of teeth, and sundry, and those strange, gestures and roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringes
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:12171:225"/>
and struglinges she made, most manifestly appeared.</p>
               <p>After which the <hi>Pater noster</hi> being sayd, the Priest began againe to giue a more shrewd assault to the aduersary, with likewise hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Paten, with the body it selfe of our Lord ouer the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons head, and sayng: Behold heere, O wicked spirit, thy iudge; behold the supreme power, now resist, if thou canst; behold him, who being to suffer for our saluation, affirmed that then the Prince of this world was to be banished hence; heere is that sacred body, which being taken from the body of a holy Virgin, extended on the Crosse, put into a Sepulcher, and risen from death, ascended tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant into heauen. So then in the power of this Maiesty, O ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant spirit, I do commaund thee to leaue this his seruant, &amp; not dare to molest her more. That sayd, and the hoast (according to the vse) being deuided into three partes, he gaue the Pax to the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster: which peace and health diffused by him, through all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with particuler influence did euen penetrate into the soule and body of the possessed, because the vniust and pertinacious pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessour went forth immediatly from her, declaring thereby of what efficacy and value the Sacrament of the Altar is, especially being handled with the purity and fayth it deserues. And it may be well belieued with good reason, that this Diuell with whome so much tampering was vsed, was one of the cheifest of the Hellish squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, since others of a lower rancke not only vsed to fly away ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fearefully from the coniurations vsed, and presence of the seruant of Christ; but euen also from his Stole, though he himselfe had by<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

and a miserable habit, signifying that matters went not very well with him. Being asked the particuler, he added with dolourous accents, that he was giuen vp into the power of huge, and cruel Elfes; he had scarcely sayd so much, when being pushed with a fury, and chased away from the face of the seruant of God, he suddenly vanished. Then the Saint with a sigh and compassion as behoued, sayd, calling after him with a loud voice: I command thee in the name of the Highest, to returne to me againe within few dayes, to tell me how thou farest. From hence applying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to help that soule with prayers and sacrifices, he neuer gaue ouer vntill such tyme as the dead himselfe appearing once more according to the precept giuen him, did comfort him with the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py newes of his deliuery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Bernard</hi> found himselfe on a certaine tyme in a strange man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to be grieued and oppressed with an excesse of cold humors, so as a gush of fleame continually running from him, soone brought that body, nigh worne and spent already, to a manifest point of death. His children and other Deuotes doe gather about him, as it were to prepare the exequyes, and he being in excesse of mind, seemes to himselfe to be brought vnto the Tribunall of Christ, where the ancient aduersary was likwise present most outragious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accusing him. The accusation ended, and space giuen to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of Christ to plead &amp; defend himselfe, not shewing the while any signe of perturbation at all, thus answered: I do confesse I am not worthy of eternall glory, nor of the heauenly kingdome; but my Lord who possesseth the same by a double title, that is, by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall inheritance, and painefull purchase, contenting himselfe with the one of the two titles, of the other makes a liberall guift to me, and in vertue of this deuotion, I doe with reason aspire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. At which answere the enemy was confounded, that forme of iudgement and tribunall vanished, and the man of God without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more returned to himselfe againe.</p>
               <p>Another tyme he beheld himselfe at the Sea side, expecting a ship to passe ouer, the ship came &amp; approached to him: but being to leape therinto, it suddenly gaue backe; so did it thrice togeather, and at last leauing him on the shore, it went away without retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning any more: so as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> easily gathered, that the houre of his passage was not yet come, notwithstanding his dolours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued so much more sharp and irksome, as he had lesse hope to be

hastily rid thereof. Now it happened in the euening, that all the other Monkes going according to custome to the lesson which was made of the collations of the ancient Fathers, the two only assistants of the Abbot remayned there, and he being continually more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted and tormented with the malady, bad one of them to go into the Church to pray for him. There were three Altars in the sayd Church, one of the Blessed Virgin, and at the sides thereof two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to wit, of S. <hi>Laurence,</hi> and of S. <hi>Benet;</hi> making prayer then at all three, euen at the instant the glorious Mother of God accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed with those two Saints, with such a suauity and serenity, as may rather be imagined then described, entred into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

From hence
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:12171:226"/>
twenty dayes being passed, the sicke man still remayning quite forsaken of the Phisitians, S. <hi>Bernard</hi> appeared to him in his cell in spirit, paternally visiting him, sung there the mattyns with a good number of brothers, and passed all that night with him: and the morning being come, <hi>Robert</hi> without any more adoe, arose vp sound, and faithfully recounted the manner how he escaped so great a daunger. A notable euent surely; but this other is no lesse wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of memory.</p>
               <p>The seruant of God lay sicke in <hi>Clareuallis,</hi> more worne and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayd with labours and infirmityes, then yeares; how beyt he ceased not to attend to the gouernement of his Monkes, and to feed them with the word of God, and to rise likewise euery day to celebrate Masse, which he neuer omitted but of meere necessity, reuiuing his afflicted members with the feruour of spirit. In this while it so happened, that he was fayne to send some person of quality into some more remote parts of <hi>Germany</hi> about matters of importance. For which enterprise a German Monke was elected, by name <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> whom with many other subiects the same holy Father some six yeares before in his returne from <hi>Constance,</hi> had induced to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine seruice. This man entring into so long a voyage, especially in the midst of winter, as one with reason indeed feared many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sasters, and aboue all he doubted, least the venerable Abbot might come to dye in the meane tyme, and he remayne defrauded and depriued of his last benediction. But the holy Father blessing him for the present and saying: Goe thy wayes in Gods name, for thou shalt returne safe, and shalt further find me as thou desirest: and so sent him away full of comfort.</p>
               <p>Being arriued in the territory of <hi>Strasburge,</hi> as he was passing ouer a riuer all frozen with Ice, his beast stumbled, and he without remedy fell quite ouer head and eares in the water. What could the poore wretch doe heere being plundged beneath in the waters, aboue couered with Ice, &amp; both back and sides being dashed with the current? He had surely no comfort but meerely the promise of the holy Father, by whom indeed he was not deceiued. Because in that agony he saw him before him, and was so full of consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion withall, that now he selt not the violence of the riuer, nor any difficulty of breathing, nor finally feare, nor any manner of disease at all. Heereupon forsaking the beast he was on, through diuine power, he found himselfe to be pushed softly against the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:12171:227"/>
streame without any force of his to the same breach, which with his fall he had made, where taking hold with his hands on the edge of the Ice he escaped; he returned very safe and sound to <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuallis,</hi> and for a full accomplishment of ioy and contentment, had the wished fauour to see his most deere and desired Maister againe, to whom he shewed himselfe very gratefull and obsequious, not only as long as he liued, but euen also after the death of S. <hi>Bernard</hi> in frequenting his sepulcher, and there most deuoutly making his prayers.</p>
               <p>Surely a large matter of discourse for him that would compare this with other such like meruayles. But let vs, leauing this arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiousnes to Oratours, content our selues with the naked &amp; simple truth. Besides what hath been sayd, it is also reported for a thing most certaine, that the vigilant Prelate in the gouernement of his order through diuers Monasteryes very farre asunder and remote from him, gaue many commissions and precepts of things, which through human meanes he could no wayes come to vnderstand, in so much as though absent in person, notwithstanding (as it is read likewise of S. <hi>Benet,</hi> and other seruants of God) with the spirit he seemed to be present at the actions and proceedings of his Monkes. The which reuelations albeit Deuines ascribe to the gift of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; yet we restrayning the sense of this word, and applying it only vnto presage and prediction of future things, shall demonstrate, that to S. <hi>Bernard</hi> also (among other titles) this same so precious a guift was not wanting.</p>

But the mind and iudgment of the wise Abbot in this point was so farre otherwise. Who by diuine aduise knowing suddenly the quality of his vocation, first sighing held his peace, then in the presence of all, he sayd: This man is sent hither by the euill spirit, he comes without a companion, and without a companion he shall goe his wayes againe. At this speach of his, they were astonished and amazed, who euen now could not containe themselues for ioy: neuerthelesse not to scandalize those tender plants S. <hi>Bernard</hi> was content to admit <hi>Stephen</hi> vpon tryall, especially making large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises to obserue very punctually the rule, and to execute with all promptnes whatsoeuer should be ordayned him. But it was not long ere being ouercome with the tediousnes of silence and of soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, being affrighted with the rigour of the obseruance, &amp; weary of the exercises, and mentall labours, he was seene to be drawne forth of the Oratory by a vile Black-more, as heeretofore was that Monke of <hi>Cassin.</hi> From hence after some six monthes were passed, repenting himselfe of the good begun, he endeauours to attempt, and to stirre vp others, according to the manner of Religious men ill grounded &amp; mutable, who being resolued to leaue the banners of Christ, and to returne to the leekes of Aegypt, thinke to couer their shame with the multitude of companions, and to diminish the infamy by communicating the fault: but neither he, nor he that set him a worke could effect the same. Because all those soules, through the preseruatiue infused into them by the faythfull &amp; pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Steward, still remayned where they were, firme and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueable, and according to the protestation of the holy Pastour, that vnhappy <hi>Stephen de Vitreo</hi> did but trauaile in vayne. He entred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and alone went forth againe. Nor was the prophesy which followes much vnlike.</p>
               <p>Three yong men hauing taken the habit together in <hi>Clareuallis</hi> one of them through instigation of the deuill, within a litle while

after returned to his vomit againe. Whereupon the Fathers being so much more anxious for the health of the other two, in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence treated of this matter with the holy Abbot. Then he looking in the face of both those Nouices, answeared plainely: This man shall neuer haue temptations of moment. That other shall haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but shall finally preuayle. The one then with a prosperous gale went allwayes forward in religion. The other being encompassed with tribulations, and assayled with perillous assaults, after he had wauered more then once, and turned his back as it were, yet being sustayned by diuine grace, and through the memory of the Saints promises, victorious at last was crowned with perseuerance. Of these kind of Oracles this same that followes was so much more famous, as it was published vpon a greater occasion, and in a place more notable, and with persons more illustrious.</p>
               <p>

                  </gap>sion, as to expell them by force from their Churches and Cittyes. Whereupon S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> wrote many letters to him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease him, whose coppyes are yet kept to this day. It chaunced the while, the seruant of Christ being present, that many of those Bishops, to mollify the Kings mind prostrate with all humility on the ground, and imbracing his feet, were not all able to moue him to pitty. The man of God touched with this spectacle, and full of a holy zeale stuck not the day following to giue a free and stout reprehension to the King himselfe, for hauing in that manner despised the submission, and prayers of the Preists of Christ, and clearely made protestation of that which was reuealed to him, that night. This thy obstinacy shall cost thee the death of <hi>Philip</hi> thy el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest sonne, and sworne Prince. I haue seene thee, in company of thy yonger sonne fall prostrate at the feete of those Bishops, whom but yesterday thou madest so small accompt of: Collecting thence, that soone thou shalt loose <hi>Philip,</hi> and for substitution of this other, thou shalt sue to the Prelates, whome now thou vsest so hardly, Which was not long ere it came to passe. <hi>Philip</hi> dyed, and the Father being humbled, wrought by al meanes with the Ecclesiastical state, that <hi>Lewes</hi> the second borne might be accepted for Successour, and be annoynted with accustomed ceremonyes. And so much may suffice of matters sayd or done by this admirable man aboue all force or terme of nature: of which subiect notwithstanding, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happs

               <head>The great Humility of <hi>S. Bernard</hi> in auoyding worldly prayses and hhnours, and the pious shift he vsed to acquite himselfe thereof. <hi>Chap.</hi> 26.</head>
               <p>OF all that which we haue hitherto written, or left vntouched, two things doe most astonish me. The one how S. <hi>Bernard</hi> amidst so great variety of vniuersall businesses mainetayned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe allwayes as Lord and Maister of himselfe, without neglecting euer the custody of his hart, and continuall examine of his actions; and alwayes walking therein so vigilant and prouident, as if euen then from the shade of the Nouiciate he had past forth into the dust, &amp; sunne of Christian warfarre. The other wonder is, how among so many fauours from heauen, and applauses of men, he neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned the confines and center of holy Humility; and this seems to me to be the principall cause why continually from the diuine hand were showred vpon him so excellent guifts, and so rare and inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable graces: because that euen as there is nothing which of its part, more dryes vp the fountaines of the diuine benignity, then Pride and Arrogancy, in whose company Ingratitude goes hand in hand: so is there not a nearer and more apt disposition, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come capable of that souueraigne liberality, then Modesty, and to thinke humbly of ones selfe. With which as we see also in human thinges, a deuout will, and a solicitous care of thankes-giuing goe commonly vnited. The great seruant of God would discourse high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as well of this as of other heroicall vertues, and among other ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall sentences he was wont to vtter, he would say: The true humble man desires not to be held for humble, but vile and abiect, and that surely with reason, since to the magnanimity of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils corresponds, though in a more eminent degree, the humility of Christians, whose property is to hide and conceale their owne prayses as much as may be: though humility outwardly be obscure and neglected, yet inwardly being quaint and well deckt, it shines so after, as all, eyther first or last, in fixing their eyes thereon, doe admire it without end. But how S. <hi>Bernard</hi> despised from the hart to be prized &amp; reuerenced of the world, may be manifestly known by that which I shall tell.</p>

There was not farre off from a Castle of his, a Monastery of Canon-Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, to whome he was much deuoted. Heere as soone as he was depriued of his Wife, he placed his sonne, who was about some eight yeares old, that from his tender yeares, vnder spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall standarts, he might accustome himselfe vnto Christian war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farre. S. <hi>Hugh</hi> was very willingly receaued by those good Fathers, and put ouer to a venerable old man, who was to instruct him in learning, and religious discipline. This man with a reuerent gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity, first premonished him to beware of licencious &amp; light sports, and to endeauour to anticipate the benefit of tyme, with maturity of manners, and sometymes would say vnto him: <hi>Hugh, I trayne thee vp for Christ, these sportes become thee not.</hi> And his admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were not in vaine: the holy Ghost found such disposition in him of wit

and purity, as he was soone replenished with wisedome, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, whence in short tyme, he came to be very gratefull to God, and most deare to men. In the meane while, the Knight his Father touched with heauenly inspiration, leauing the world, retyred himselfe into the same Monastery, and there attended to the seruice of God vnto his liues end.</p>
               <p>But S. <hi>Hugh,</hi> as soone as he arriued to the nineteenth yeare of his age, at the instance of the whole Conuent, hauing taken all the holy Orders, except Priesthood, was applyed by Superiours to the help of a certaine Parish, in which office he bare himselfe in such sort, as euery one framed a high conceit of his sanctity &amp; prudence: but our Lord willing to lead him to a life of stricter obseruance, &amp; of greater merit, disposed that his Priour, going for deuotion as he was wont, to visit the <hi>Charter-house</hi> of <hi>Grenoble,</hi> tooke <hi>S. Hugh</hi> in his company, who making his prayer, and now entred in the Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, in beholding partly the solitude and silence, partly also the semblance and manners of the Monkes, felt immediatly such an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent desire of passing vnto the same Rule to enkingle in his breast, as not being able by any meanes to conceale, or endure the flame, he began presently to make secret practises, and to intreate the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers one by one to vouchsafe to admit him into their Institute.</p>
               <p>His Priour was aware heereof, and calling him aside with do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourous sighes and teares in his eyes: O my beloued Sonne (sayd he) I see well now, and perceaue too well, I haue brought thee hither to my great mishap, and the irreparable losse of my whole flocke. And as soone as they returned home againe, he discouered all to the Chanons, and especially to the Father of <hi>S.

This being once vnderstood, they runne presently to the younge man, and more fully informed themselues of the nouelty from his owne mouth, and finally pressed him so hard, as they made him to promise with an Oath, that he would not forsake them. To which purpose, by how much <hi>S. Hugh</hi> condescended against his will, so much more troublesome and sharpe prickes of conscience, and scuples felt he in himself: on the one side, the touches of a more high vocation ceased not to molest him, and with reason feared he to constrist are the holy Ghost, in resisting so: on the other, he was opposed against by fraternall charity, and the promise he had made with an oath.

of spirits, after many prayers and considerations, was satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed at last, that he was not tyed to the obseruance of his word and promise, which hindered him from the greater seruice of God, and his own perfection.

               <p>THe souldier of Christ, being now entred into a new warre, beginnes to feele new battailes, all which notwithstanding through diuine succour to him, were a subiect to him of glorious triumphes. Especially he was molested day and night by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscible part, neuerthelesse to conserue his Virginity, he ceased not to macerate his flesh with abstinences, vigils, scourges, &amp; other mortifications; yet sometymes refreshed with consolations againe, and with heauenly sweetnes, with which meanes, and with hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and continuall prayer, at last the fiery shafts of the enemy were quite extinguished. A midst these labours, the tyme of Priesthood approaching, a venerable, old man (whome <hi>S. Hugh</hi> according to the custome of the Order, through charity &amp; submission deuoutly serued) demanded of him, if he were willing to be a Priest or no! Whereunto he hauing sincerely answered, that for his part there was nothing in the world he desired more; to whome the old man replying with a seuere countenance. And how darest thou aspire to a degree whereto none, how holy soeuer, but through constraine is worthily aduanced? At this reprehension <hi>S. Hugh</hi> being terrifyed falling flat on the ground, with teares in his eyes, suddenly craued pardon; at which humility of his, the Maister being tender, and touched with the spirit of prophecy sayd: Rise vp my sonne, rise vp, do not trouble thy selfe, I know very well with what effect, and with what intention thou vtteredst such wordes: and I tell thee moreouer, and affirme it to thee without all doubt, that ere long, thou shalt be a Priest, and within a certaine tyme after shalt thou be a Bishop also. At which presage of his, the good disciple ful of blushing, and confusion held his peace, and a little after being promoted to the dignity of the Altar, prepared himselfe with most
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:12171:232"/>
exact diligence to the sacrifice, and with the same continuing to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate, not only slackened not, but augmented his spirituall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises, and his accustomed mortifications, whence he tooke such a weaknes of stomacke, as euer after afflicted him sorely; for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligation of the rule, and the publike assemblies of the Quire, the Chapter, and the like, was he euer the first, endeauouring in all thinges, yea euen in the least, to edify as many, as conuersed with him.</p>
               <p>In this manner, hauing passed in his priuate Cell, and priestly ministery about ten yeares, the principall Procuratourship of the house, being a charge amongst those Religious of no light impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, was by Superiours imposed vpon him, and which to S. <hi>Hugh</hi> layd open a new field to exercise his excellent Vertues in. Because he vnderstanding very well, how from his care and vigilancy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended the Religious quiet, and contemplatiue life of the others, abandoning quite for the loue of Christ his owne consolations, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with extraordinary care, vnto all the partes of Oeconomy, and of a perfect Steward, making prouisions in good tymes, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting the necessityes of euery one, and especially of the sicke; surueying, and reuiewing the accounts of the Officialls and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, improuing continually the possessions, defending and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing the rights and rents, and all in such manner, and with that maturity, as well gaue the world to vnderstand, how farre he was from all particuler interest.</p>
               <p>For these so rare qualityes, in short tyme his fame was spread euen to the remotest Countreyes,; and <hi>Henry</hi> the second King of <hi>England,</hi> who in those dayes, was vpon founding a Monastery of <hi>Carthusians</hi> at <hi>VVhitam,</hi> &amp; through the ill condition of that neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, could not bring the matter to any good passe: after he had with small fruite applyed two Priours of the Order vpon the enterprise; being finally moued with the constant relation of the worth, and sanctity of S. <hi>Hugh,</hi> not fayled to send in post, to that end, very honourable personages to the aforesayd <hi>Charterhouse</hi> of <hi>Grenoble</hi> (and among them <hi>Reginald</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bath)</hi> to require him for this office. To which purpose, those Fathers being assembled togeather, there followed an earnest dispute among them, while to some it seemed not iust or reasonable, for any ones sake whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to depriue their owne house of so firme a propp, &amp; others iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging on the contrary, &amp; with liuely reasons demonstrating, how it
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:12171:233"/>
became not Christian charity, and the Euangelicall profession, to haue the eye fixed vpon the commodityes only of one family, and to keep that vertue enclosed in so little a space, which might be extended for the benefit and saluation of foraine nations, with the great augmentation of the diuine glory.</p>
               <p>Among such contentions had for a while, to and fro, of no light moment, that Part preuayled at last which would the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike and vniuersall, should be preferred before the priuate; and that they ought not, with so harsh a repulse prouoke the displeasure of so great a King. In this manner S. <hi>Hugh,</hi> being otherwise an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to Prelacy, and who protested himselfe to be wholy insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for such a charge, was by Superiours constrained to take it v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him: and not without much teares, departing from his deere Cloister in company of the sayd Embassadours, he arriued sale &amp; sound at the coasts of <hi>England.</hi> From thence without going to the Court, trauayling by the neerest way to <hi>VVhittam,</hi> the first thing he endeauoured to do, was with a cheerfull countenance, and with fit exhortations to comfort those few afflicted Monks whom he found there: and being afterwards sent for by letters vnto the Kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, through diuine fauour he had such grace in the eyes of that Maiesty, as that after diuers discourses thereof, he brought away both for the present and future necessities, a very large prouision of all thinges; and besides could tell how to vse such dexterity with that people, and so to purchase their loue and good opinion, as that from harsh, contumacious, and froward, in short tyme they became very gentle, obedient and tractable: whereby very easily both the Church became more enriched through diuine offices, &amp; the house to be the better accommodated for the sustentation of the Monkes, and for the splendour and ornament of the place the fabricque to be finished; while S. <hi>Hugh</hi> laboured thereat with his owne handes, and carrying, for example and publique edification, stones &amp; mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on his shoulders: in so much, as many seculars being inuited, partly by his sweet and sanctifyed manners, &amp; partly also through a gust of a retyred life, and of the commodity of the buildings there, abandoning the cares of the world, and renouncing the proper li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, came thither to consecrate themselues vnto God, &amp; by vow to oblige themselues vnto monasticall discipline.</p>

               <p>THe king of <hi>England,</hi> tooke no small co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort at these proceedings, he reioyced much, in that he was not deceiued awhit in his iudgment in the election of such a one. And (as he was a wise and prudent King) hauing very often familiar and long discourses with the Priour, the more he diued into him, the greater esteeme made he, not only of his prudence, but of his piety and perfection also, holding it a great happynes, to haue such a man in his Kingdome, and placing a good part of his hopes in his deuout intercessions &amp; suffrages: as among other tymes, he cleerely shewed, when as returning with a great Army, from the enterprize of <hi>France,</hi> he was suddenly assayled with so cruell a tempest, as the fury of the winds illuding all the art of the Mariners; they all betooke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, as many as were with him, according to custome, to vowes and prayers; and the King notwithstanding perceauing the waues to grow more rough, brake forth at last into these words: O if my good <hi>Hugh</hi> of the <hi>Charter-howse,</hi> were now aware of this, &amp; would make ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t prayer for vs, as he was wont, the diuine mercy would not be so slow to our succour. And a little after, with other sighes he gaue not ouer, but added: O blessed God, whom the Priour of <hi>VVhittam</hi> truly serues, vouchsafe through the merits and intercession of thy faythfull seruant, with the eye of pitty, to reguard our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse, and afflictions. And behold the inuocation was scarcely fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, but a calme began, in such sort, as the whole company, with as many as sayled with them, yeilding thanks without end to the diuine Clemency, very happily arriued at the wished port.</p>
               <p>The newes whereof on a sudden flew into all parts, and the name of S. <hi>Hugh,</hi> grew to be in so great veneration, as <hi>Henry</hi> had not in his whole kingdome besides, a man he esteemed more, nor in whom he reposed more confidence: and the number of those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious went multiplying euery day more &amp; more; in the manage &amp; instruction of whom, S. <hi>Hugh</hi> shewed very well, how excellent a guift he had in gouernement. Because, that pursuing his ancient thoughts, the first thing he endeuoured effectually, was that men might know cleerely, that nothing was more deer vnto him, then the quiet and consolation of euery one. To works (as need was) he
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:12171:234"/>
adioyned words, and efficacious and discreet aduises. But aboue all things he pressed them, through the example of his owne man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; being so habituated in treating with God, as his familiars also in his sleep, should heare him vnawares to pray, &amp; say his Psalter. He was besides, as much as publike occasions permitted him, much giuen to sacred reading, and was wont to say, how the diuines Scriptures to all Religious, and especiall to such as leade a more solitary life, are delights in peace, armes in warre, foode in tyme of famine, and a medecine in infirmity: so as, when according to the custome of the Order, he eate alone, he had allwayes, on a litle table, the scripture open before him, or some holy Doctour: though otherwise, he was so diligent in the custody of his senses, as when he happened on holy dayes to take his refection with the rest, he would neuer hold his eyes from the table cloth, his eares from the pulpit, and his mind from God. This holy man was exceeding ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refull, that, for his sake or any of his, no person should receiue any agreiuance and scandall.</p>
               <p>And to this purpose, we may not conceale, how the King ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing taken from a certaine rich Monastery, and well furnished with bookes, the new and old Testament, written by those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars, with great labour and diligence, and bestowed it on the Fathers of <hi>VVhittam,</hi> as yet not well prouided of such necessaryes: as soone as S. <hi>Hugh</hi> had knowledge therof, from one of the aforesaid Monastery, he answeared with a sad cheer: thus stands the matter then. The King would haue depriued your Church of your labours and trauayles, so fruitefull, to accommodate and enrich vs by such meanes. We cry you mercy with all our harts for the losse you haue sustayned for our sake, though in truth til now we were neuer made acquainted therewith. Take yee then the Booke agayne, and if your Fathers will not receaue it, I will without more ado; restore it my selfe, to the party that caused it to be brought hither. And further, if they be willing to accept the same, I will cause the matter to be kept secret by all meanes. This modesty of his pleased them exceedingly, and as they remayned much edifyed thereat, so they came to contract a great frendship with the Family of <hi>VVhittam.</hi>

               <p>NOw approached the tyme, destined by the diuine prouidence, for the exaltation of his faythfull and wise feruant. The Sea of the Citty of <hi>Lincolne</hi> had now beene vacant for some eighteene years, and those of the Chapter being moued at the losse which the flocke suffered so without a Pastour, laying finally aside the strifes and contentions risen amongst them, resolued with the approbation of the Metropolitan of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to goe a sufficient number of them to the Court of the King, vnder whose protection, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendency, the election being celebrated with wonted cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monyes, they agreed vpon the person of the Priour of <hi>VVhittam:</hi> whereat <hi>Henry,</hi> being extraordinarily ioyfull, sent the newes thereof presently to <hi>S. Hugh,</hi> as he thought most ioyfull tydinges. There also arriued together, the letters and messages of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop himselfe, who congratulating with him for such a dignity, did liuely exhort him not to resist so honourable a iudgment of the Canons, and so manifest a signe of the diuine will. His freinds li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewise generally encouraged him to it, with reasons and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunityes.</p>
               <p>But <hi>S. Hugh,</hi> now experienced in the chast gouernment of soules, weighed all things with a more iust ballance, and who knew very well, how great temerity it was, in a stormy sea to take volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily in charge with so much hazard a barke repleate with the bloud of Christ, with might and mayne endeuoured to withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from the enterprise: alleadging besides his owne insufficiency, the election to be likewise inualid, as well for being prosecuted forth of the Diocesse, and practized with the fauour and authority of the King &amp; Archbishop, as for that the voyce of the Priour of the great <hi>Charterhouse</hi> was not concurring thereto, without whose ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, he could by no meanes accept such a charge.</p>
               <p>These and many other things of like tenour, the man of God replyed: hoping the Electours eyther mooued through equity, or disdaining the repulse, would easily turne the designes to the other part. But through diuine dispensation he remayned much deceiued of his conceit. Because the same humility wherewith he thought himselfe vnworthy of such a manage, &amp; the earnest instance which
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:12171:235"/>
he made, that it might be transferred vpon some other, inflamed the Chanons to extoll and aduance so great submission, &amp; so great ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; so as to take away from <hi>S. Hugh</hi> all excuses and occasions, being a new assembled togeather in the same Citty &amp; Cathedrall Church of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> with like consent they ratifyed the decree as at first, and besides sending for that purpose vnto the great Charter-house of persons of quality, they brought backe in ample forme, not leaue only, but so expresse command, as for S. <hi>Hugh</hi> there was no euasion.</p>
               <p>With this dispach went all the fauourers of that creation very glad and triumphant to the Monastery, and taking the sad and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull Priour from his Cell, they lead him with great ioy to the Cathedrall Church. In which act appeared very well how great a friend he was of pouerty both of body and mind, because being not able to hinder so noble a concourse, which came to accompany him, reteyning at least in himselfe, the desired lowlynes, he would neuer permit some few co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modityes of his, for his owne vse, should be carryed by any: but rather putting them behind him on the cropper of his horse would needes conuay them himselfe publiquely to the Bishops lodgings, and by no meanes before consecration; he would admit eyther title of Prelacy, Pontifical robes, or attendance of seruants.</p>
               <p>Finally being afterwards annoynted, and placed with solemne rites, in the Pontifical Throne, he felt himselfe as a choyce and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed vessell, to be replemshed with so great a plenty of celestiall gifts, and particularly of the spirit of fortitude, as from that tyme he made a purpose to spare no labours, to shun no perills, nor yeild to intreaty or threats, where the diuine glory, or good of the Church might take place: and for this very respect, he liked not those rich Presents, with the fresh gratulations sent vnto him from the king; and so it was necessary for him to make such a resolution. Because there passed not many dayes, but that the King Raungers of the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest (so they call in those countryes, the ouerseers of the forests and of the chaces of the kings) relying on their fauour in Court, and on the custome now vsurpt a good while, vpon light occasion layd hands vpon a Clerk, and condemned him in a good summe of mony. Whereof S. <hi>Hugh</hi> being fully enformed, with reason (sayd he) these people are called Foresters, as it were standing forth of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God. Heerupon calling to a Consult, certaine excellent Doctours, and such as feared God (whereof, from the tyme he
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:12171:235"/>
was first assumpted to the Chayre, he had made prouision with good care) and by the common opinion of all, hauing giuen due premonishments already to the delinquents, he courageously pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to excommunicate the head of that company.</p>
               <p>K. <hi>Henry</hi> tooke this act of the Bishop very bitterly; but yet to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy himselfe better of his disposition, dissembling the matter for the present, he requested of him by messengers and letters in post, a Prebendary then vacant in the Diocesse of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> in fauour of a certaine Courtier; while some freinds of S. <hi>Hugh</hi> laboured it much, that he might take occasion thereby to mittigate the anger of the King, &amp; to returne into grace with him: but the souldiour of Christ, hauing read the petition, sayd: These vacant places are not to be conferred vpon Courtiers, but to Ecclesiastikes rather. The Kings Maiesty wants not meanes to reward his seruants: nor is it iust, to depriue such of their rents, who serue the king of heauen, to bestow them on those, who wayte vpon the Princes of the earth. With this answere he dispacht away the messengers of K. <hi>Henry,</hi> &amp; being intreated at least graciously to absolue the Raunger, he could not be brought therunto.</p>
               <p>Vnto such, and so open contradictions of the Bishop, the King being accustomed to be obeyed as a becke, brake his patience at last, and sending for him, after the vpbreading him with so many graces &amp; fauours don him, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>playned bitterly for so hard a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure from him. And the venerable Bishop, being not troubled any thing thereat, with a graue and sweet countenance withall, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated to him, how in the whole affayre he had regard, next to the seruice of God, principally to his eternall saluation: which incurred manifest danger, when through his occasion, eyther the oppressours of the Church remayned vnpunished, or sacred bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices were rashly bestowed. And briefly S. <hi>Hugh</hi> could so wisely iustify that fact, as the King being a man otherwise discreet, and a freind of iustice, remayned satisfyed, and restored the blessed man into his ancient freindship agayne. After this the Raunger shewing himselfe sorowfull and penitent for his ill deportments; S. <hi>Hugh</hi> gaue him, not without the publike chasticement of the verge ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the <hi>Canons,</hi> the desired absolution, and further assisted him in spirit: in so much as of a troublesome aduersary, he had him euer after a freind much deuoted to him, and in busynesses occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a most faythfull sollicitour. With the same courage of mind S.
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:12171:236"/>
                  <hi>Hugh</hi> endeuoured, to extirpate many inueterated abuses from that administration; among which was that very markable which we shall speake of in the next Chapter.</p>

               <p>THe Clergy was wont euery yeare, to present the King with a precious Mantle, at the charge of the people; and the care of going heere and there, to make the collection, the Clergy had taken vpon them, reteyning afterwards, and diuiding among them as it were for their paynes, those moneyes which amounted ouer and aboue: and that to the extreame disgrace of their Order, and most greiuous scandall of the people. The new Pastour, could by no meanes endure this custome amongst them: and hauing effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously made the Preists, to acknowledge the shame, and impiety thereof, he likewise obteyned from K. <hi>Henry</hi> authentique Patents, wherein he renounced such a guift, and ech right, which vpon any apparence he might pretend thereunto. The Magistrats &amp; Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall Iudges, in criminall causes touching that Court, were wont to condemne the delinquents for the most part, in mony: whence it followed the rich not caring much for such penaltyes, perseuered most impudently in their sinnes. S. <hi>Hugh</hi> therefore op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed himselfe maynly against this inconuenience, by changing the losse of mony into corporall afflictions, or into publike notes of infamy, or els when the case required it, also into excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; the which thunder as we shall presently see, came neuer from the hands of the Saint without admirable effects.</p>
               <p>K. <hi>Henry</hi> in the meane while, after diuerse trauailes of mind &amp; body, departed this life, with much hope and many signes of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination. There succeeded him <hi>Richard</hi> his sonne: who by how much he shewed himselfe lesse propitious and freindly to <hi>S. Hugh,</hi> so much greater and more ample a field he gaue him of exercise, &amp; of glory. This King imitating his <hi>Auncestours,</hi> passed ouer to the warre in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and in processe of tyme, as it happens, the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maisters of the Campe being out of money, he resolued to send back the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> whom he had then with him, into <hi>England;</hi> that by the fauour and help of the Clergy, he might seeke to get from his subiects the greatest quantity of mony he could pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:12171:236"/>
procure. The Archbishop obeyed, and calling an assembly in a fit place, he found none that openly durst oppose, but the Bishop of <hi>Lincolne:</hi> who detesting the impious contentions betweene Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Princes (especially at such tymes, when the warres of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and enterprise of the <hi>Holy-land,</hi> waxed hoate) demonstrated with solidgrounds, how vnlawfull it was, without very iust and vrgent necessity, to squize the substance of the poore afflicted subiects.</p>
               <p>To this voyce of his, consented, though but timerously, another Bishop only, whose name is not expressed. For all the rest, they striued to please the King. Who being certifyed by the Archbishop of what happened in the said Congregation, was so troubled the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reat, and enflamed with rage, as that suddenly he gaue order to a principall Officer, as he loued his life, with a sufficient preparation without delay, he should vtterly ruyne and destroy both those ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate and rebellious Bishops. The Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missary was not slack in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying. But the matter succeeded not so happily with one, as with the other. Because the timerous Bishop, at the first noyse of the Court, abandoned his Church, and the sacred goods without resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance were all confiscated. But the blessed Bishop, vpon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of that profane and rauenous troupe, calling on the diuine assistance, prepares for Excommunication, &amp; caused all the Parishes to ring their bells, with such confidence, and with such a presence of vndaunted courage, as the Courtiers who held him a Saint and fauourer of God, being terrifyed and confounded, returned backe without doing any thing. And some few dayes after being passed ouer, the other Pastour at the intercession of his friends, was recalled from banishment, and the King by this tyme being retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from <hi>France,</hi> he went very suppliantly to meet with him, and with teares to aske him pardon, and with humble promises not to contradict any more.

               <p>S. <hi>Hugh</hi> putting his confidence in iustice &amp; reason, remayned still immoueable in his residence, the Court being especially at that tyme farre off: but afterwardes bethinking himselfe of the precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous nature of the Prince, and the ill offices he had done already,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:12171:237"/>
and which a new were like to be done by him, and how at last, the fury would come to fall vpon his poore people; laying aside all feare, and all respect of death or affronts, he determined to goe in person to the Kinges presence, and to pacify him by those meanes which were conuenient to the diuine glory, and quality of the tymes. With the ayde of prayer then, putting himselfe on the way, he was no sooner come to his iourneyes end, but some of his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall friendes, and zealous of the honour of God, came to meet him, intreating him most earnestly, and coniuring him withall, that by no meanes he would appeare before the King, nor giue him occasion to renew in him, the slaughters, and cruelties heeretofore happening, with so much infamy of the Kingdome in the person of the glorious Martyr S. <hi>Thomas</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These and other thinges to this purpose, with much affect represented those vertuous men, wherewith while S. <hi>Hugh</hi> was nothing moued, one that loued him more tenderly then the rest, neuer left intreating him, he would be pleased at least, to stay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till such tyme, as he might preoccupy the mind of K. <hi>Richard,</hi> with fit offices, and so dispose him with prayers &amp; reasons, as he might not looke awry vpon him. To such an offer, the Bishop answered, full of vndaunted courage and fraternall charity: Would you then, to saue my selfe, I put thee and all thy family in hazard? And what greater gust could my enemyes haue, then to take occasion to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate thee as partiall to me, and enemy of the Crowne? That sayd, without more ado, he passed into the Kinges lodgings, and finding him by chance hearing of Masse, in his Chappell, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached to him with a cheerfull countenance, and demanded of him (according to the vse of that Country) the holy kisse of vnion and loue. And the King disdainefully answering: No, thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruest it not; yea but I doe, answered S. <hi>Hugh,</hi> and that especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally after so long a iourney: and withall taking him pleasantly by the Robe, endeauours to hang on him with so great ingenuity, as K. <hi>Richard</hi> changing his bitternes to a sweet countenance, was won at last, and kissed him.</p>
               <p>At such a sight, the Prelates and Barons standing by, remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned astonished. And so the Masse went on: and in the meane tyme the seruant of Christ, without putting himselfe into the company, or taking vp a feare among the Bishops, most humbly betooke himselfe to a meaner place. The King noted the act, and arguing
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:12171:237"/>
from thence, how S. <hi>Hugh</hi> was as litle in his owne eyes, as mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous and great in common causes, began to hold him in so great veneration, as that euen at that tyme, the Deacon coming according to custome, to present him the <hi>Pax,</hi> he commaunded in signe of reuerence, it should be giuen first to the Lord of <hi>Lincolne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Masse being ended, S. <hi>Hugh</hi> resoluing to giue K. <hi>Richard</hi> a fraternall admonishment, for the more decency, and liberty, he sweetely tooke him behind the Aultar, and there being both set downe together, with a gratefull aspect began to examine him, saying: how is it with your conscience? Now you are of our parish, and we are to render a streight accompt of you before the dreadful Iudge. My conscience (answeared the King) reprehends me of nothing, saue only, that I cannot beare any good will to such as stand but ill affected to my Kingdome. Then S. <hi>Hugh</hi> with a great vehemency sayd: what is this thou sayst? And is it not true, that thou goest euery day without feare imposing new greiuances vpon thy people, oppressing the poore, afflicting the innocent? And moreouer the publique fame runs, that thou keepest no fayth, nor the Sacrtment of Matrimony. And thinkest thou these to be matters of no moment? At this voyce of the Bishop, or rather of the Holy Ghost which spake in him, the King being terrifyed, was fayne to hold his peace. Whereupon with like fortitude, S. <hi>Hugh</hi> reproued him of diuers faults, which the King endeuoured partly with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses to purge himselfe, and partly craued pardon, with purpose of amending his life.</p>

               <p>IT chaunced to S. <hi>Hugh</hi> more then once, in sundry places, to be barehead, among speares and naked swordes, reprehending the armed themselues, like a Lyon, of their impious and wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours, they remayning amazed and astonished the while at so great a freedome. Vpon a tyme he met on the way with a company of Sergeants &amp; catchpoles leading a malefactour to death: &amp; being moued with the prayers of the vnhappy wretch, who in that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity most earnestly recommended himselfe vnto him, he gaue order presently to the Ministers to vnloose him, alleadging that where the Bishop was present with the faythfull people, there was the Church, &amp; that the liuing stones deserued no lesse priuiledge and exemption then the dead. The enterprise was not in vaine, though otherwise perhaps more worthy of applause, then imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and practise. The officers being moued at the maiesty of the Prelate, making some protestations only for feare of the King, left the guilty wholy free, and infinitly obliged to him, who beyond all hope had giuen him his life.</p>
               <p>Of this so great a hart, and couragious constancy of <hi>S. Hugh,</hi> if one seeke into the causes, besides the vnction of the holy Ghost, there may many be brought. And among these the naturall gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity of the man, inflamed also from tyme to tyme with the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of his old Father by vs named aboue, and the two naturall brothers of his, braue Souldiours, and valiant Champions of the Catholike Church. These men would come sometymes to visit him at <hi>Lincolne,</hi> and by letters as occasion serued, would exhort him allwayes to stand firme in his purpose, and not to yield awhit, eyther to the headlong multitude, or furious Tyrants. And gaue him moreouer to vnderstand, they had rather see him dead, then for any terrour to commit any thing vnworthy the Episcopall degree, and honour of his family. Besides which, S. <hi>Hugh</hi> helped him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe much, with his frequent reading the liues of the glorious Martyrs, and Confessours of Christ, especially of such as for defence of the diuine worship, &amp; of the sacred Constitutions, haue promptly
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:12171:238"/>
exposed themselues to all punishments. And then from his dayly sacrifices the while what comfort he felt, is a thing not easily to told: in which mistery he was so diligent, as he preferred it before all other thinges whatsoeuer; and was so grounded in that verity, as it seemed in some manner he had some cleare euidence therof, as appeared in a case which followes, in a village of those parts.</p>
               <p>Where a certaine Preist, of very dissolute manners, hauing no feare at all to celebrate that diuine Sacrament, and to handle with his impure handes the dreadfull King of Maiesty, as he came to the breaking of the consecrated Hoast, saw manifestly the most holy bloud to proceed, and fall from thence: at which sight being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted &amp; contrite, he tooke dexterously the precious liquour in the Chalice, and changing his manners, gaue himselfe to sharp pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in so much as euery one was astonished. By this occasion the miracle came to be diuulged, &amp; the Preist himselfe to giue God the glory, gaue publique account thereof, in shewing also the bloud it selfe to euery one that was desirous to be better satisfyed in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It happened, that the Bishop of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> for certaine affaires of his, was to passe that way, and with that occasion it pleased him to vnderstand and confer some spirituall thinges with the Priest, the fame of whose strange mutation and singular austerity of life, ran euery where: falling then into diuers discourses with him, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the rest the good man gaue account and information to the Bishop of the beginning of his conuersion, intreating him withall he would be pleased to contemplate with his eyes that venerable relique it selfe; which S. <hi>Hugh</hi> not only refused to do, alleadging the certainty therof had need of no such probation, but euen repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended such of his family, accepting the inuitation, of little fayth, &amp; too much curiosity. And it is a thing well knowne, that in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence as it were of so great a stedfastnes, the Sauiour himselfe, in the sight of some Religious men appeared many tymes in the Hoast informe of a most beautifull child vnto S. <hi>Hugh</hi> himselfe, while he celebrated the Masse.</p>
               <p>Besides this, the Blessed Man tooke great spirituall forces, from the liuely and more then human conceits of the holy Psalter: wherein what gust he receaued, and how obseruant he was of the tymes and determinate houres of the diuine Office, may in part be gathered at least, by that which we shall speake in the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res: and how dreadfull his Ecclesiasticall Censures were. <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.</head>
               <p>VVHile S. <hi>Hugh,</hi> was trauayling on the way, vpon publike affayres, with some Prelates and other Ecclesiasticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; he chaunced to arriue vnlooked for, at a certaine place much infested with men distracted of their witts. His companions being aduertised of the daunger, full of dread, consulted with themselues what to doe, and resolued at last, to passe those wayes by darke, &amp; with all the secrecy that might be. With this resolution remayning in the Iune, about midnight they rise, and their horses being made ready in hast, they go to the Bishop of <hi>Lincolnes</hi> chamber, who was now euen ready to say his Mattyns, and with much instance, they sollicite him, to prouide for his safety by the opportunity of the darkenes. And he answered, What should I goe hence without saying of my Mattins? Then they replyed, there would be tyme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough for that afterwards, since the present necessity affoarded no delay, and they had need to go away suddenly, if they would not be taken by those Beadlams.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>S. Hugh</hi> with his Breuiary in hand, Stay they that will stay, and feare that list to feare, sayd he, for my part I am determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not to go forth, till first I haue payd this duty. And so performed it, saying his Office with ease and attention: And after that, with his family, getting commodiously on horsebacke, he met with no misaduenture at all: whereas those wary and cautious people in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xing him for superstitious and improuident, so preferring human respects before the diuine glory fell (as it often falls out) into the same net they so carefully shunned.</p>
               <p>To all these so efficacious and potent helpes, he added another surely of an excellent vertue. He retired himselfe at least once a yeare, to the Cloyster of his beloued <hi>VVhittam,</hi> &amp; there vnder the common Rule, without any other difference, but only the sacred ring on his fingar, he attended all the vacant tyme he had, as from a high tower, to suruay the vanities of human thinges, the shortnes of life, and immense greatnes of eternall Beatitude. And casting his eyes withall vpon the infinite difficulties of spirituall gouernement, and the horrible precipice wheron all Prelacyes stand; and as at the beginning he had auoyded with all his power the Episcopal digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:12171:239"/>
so many tymes afterwards he sent letters and agents to his Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, beseeching him with much importunity to be disburdened of the administration, and restored to his Order, from whence he was taken against his will.</p>
               <p>But since his supplications were not only not heard, but euen the Sollicitours themselues came backe sometymes very shrewdly checkt from the Vicar of Christ, &amp; rather other cares for the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall good imposed vpon him; <hi>S. Hugh</hi> being enforced to obey, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared himselfe for new labours, and new battells, nourishing still with the foresayd meanes in his breast, a burning desire of satisfying the highest in all things. Whereby in difficult enterprizes, were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually matched in him a security of mind, and such a confidence, as that amidst the greatest difficultyes of all, yea euen the daungers of death it selfe, neyther lost he the peace of his soule, nor the conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent repose of his body. So as being one night for some graùe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents transported in imagination, into diuerse thoughts, which tormented him without fruite, after he had thus roued with his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasy a pretty while, at last was aware thereof, and smiting his breast with a deepe sigh, be began to reprehend himselfe sharply, for not suddenly remitting all anxieties vnto the diuine Prouidence, but being troubled and grieued for thinges so happening, as if the direction of them had depended on his owne knowledge and care: and scarcely was the day come, but calling for a Confessour, he declared that sinne with much contrition, and surely not without reason, especially the hand of the Highest so concurring with him, by wonderfull effects, as well in other actions as particularly in Censures: Wherof some euents which happened in this matter, will purchase a firme beliefe. Certaine rebellious and conturnacious fellowes being by him giuen ouer vnto the power of the Diuell, vanished immediatly, nor were euer seene more.</p>
               <p>A Souldier, who at the instigation of his wife, vniustly vsurped the goods of another, and being often reprehended for it by the holy Bishop, with diuers pretexts and falshoods still couered the same: this man being excommunicated by him one day, was on the next night following strangled by the infernall enemy: and yet for all that, another pursuing the same vniust suite, being gone to bed well fed &amp; merry, continuing sleep with death, payd the fee of his iniquity.</p>
               <p>A Deacon for hauing calumniated others of high treason against
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:12171:240"/>
his Maiesty, being worthily condemned by the Bishop, by diuers colours and policyes vsed, obteyned the absolution therof from the <hi>Metropolitan</hi> himselfe, which <hi>S. Hugh</hi> knowing to be vayne, and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reptitious, stucke not to renew the Censure; and to the end it might appeare which of the two, was the true sentence, it pleased God, that the Deacon within few dayes after, most miserably ended his dayes. A certayne yong woman, who in presence, &amp; agaynst the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of the Bishop ceased not to spit in her husbands face, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing stifled by a Diuell, very sudenly expired.</p>
               <p>A vertuous Clerke, through the faction of the more potent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quite depriued of his right which he had in a Church, after he had without any profit at all, gone to suite a good while both at home in his Country, and at Rome abroad, and consumed his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance therein, tooke finally resolution to recurre to the Bishop of <hi>Lincolne:</hi> who being well informed of the cause, and mooued to pitty vpon the trauayles of the suppliant, resolued through diuine instinct, no doubt, to thunder against all those wicked &amp; sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, although they were not of his owne iurisdiction. An ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable thing. The bolt was no sooner shot, but some of the impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous company, hauing lost their senses became furious; others ended their life vnprouided; others lost their eyes with excessiue torments, and finally, the Heauenly vengeance ceased not, vntill such tyme as the Client of <hi>S. Hugh,</hi> was restored to his Benefice againe. This also, was of much consideration which I shall presently tell you.</p>
               <p>Seauen of the Kings Court, hauing by stealth taken out a thiefe from the holy Church-yard whither for feare of iustice he had fled to saue himselfe, without the Bishops consent, hung him vp. The seruant of God resented the matter as was fit, and with his wonted armes chastized them straight. And they from others example like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise fearing the worst, very sorrowfull and compunct, cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues at his feet all crauing pardon of him, one excepted; and hauing obteyned the same, vpon condition, that among other satisfactions, being halfe naked (it being then winter) they should carry on th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

last, to prostrate himselfe in the sight of the Bishop, declaring to him a strange story of the hurts and domages befallen him in this while, as well in his honour, as in his goods and person besides, and hartily craued absolution at his hands, for mitigation at least, if not an end of so great miseryes. The conuersion &amp; supplication was not in vaine. when S. <hi>Hugh</hi> not to add affliction to affliction, absolued him with a light pennance, and restored him agayne to the Communion of the faythfull.</p>

               <p>IN these and such like affayres touching the honour of God, and Ecclesiasticall immunityes, S. <hi>Hugh</hi> would shew so much rigour and seuerity, as may seeme perhaps to be attributed, to a certaine as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity or harshnes of mind, and rusticity of manners, if otherwise he had not alwayes vsed much humanity, &amp; still reteyned the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted bowels of Mercy.

His conceipts were efficacious and liuely, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accommodated to each condition and quality of persons. Of which kind, may serue as a certayne patterne, that with diuers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations he would giue Religious to vnderstand the necessity they haue, of fighting continually with themselues, and ascending alwayes to the top of perfection. Vnto seculars, &amp; especially to such as traffike, aboue all things would he inculcate faith and truth in all things, without which of necessity all human commerce must vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perish.

               <p>In this manner, he stirred vp alwayes mortals from slouth and tepidity, and was most vigilant in encountring with the first ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines of discords, and maintayning peace, as well in priuate as in publique; hauing among other guifts so great a iudgment and light touching the point of equity, as that not only neere at hand, but also from remote countryes, and euen from <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe (as we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuated aboue) there came controuersyes delegated to him, of no light importance. He was wonderfully beloued and reuerenced by his Chanons, though for their sakes he would not swarue from righteousnes; and with his prudence, and sweetnes he knew how to manage them so, as he neuer pretended any thing from the Chapter, which he obtayned not at last; he had likewise very admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable successe in the highest affaires of the Kingdome, and among other his actions, was remarkeable that peace, which he concluded betweene King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> being the immediate successour of his brother <hi>Richard,</hi> who in punishment of the troubles brought vnto Ecclefiasticall persons, within a few yeares of his Crowne, was miserably slaine in battaile.</p>

This also was a matter of much edification, in this great Prelate that hauing lost (as we haue sayd) through excessiue absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence all appetite, was vexed with most bitter gripes of the cholike, yet fayled he not for all that, to employ himselfe when need was, with a most exact diligence, in consecrating, or rehallowing of Churches, and administring the Sacraments, especially of Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation &amp; of Order, obseruing euer the Catholike rites in al things, &amp; beginning sometimes before day, perseuering therin some houres of the night following without any refection at all. He spared not to bestow a good part of his tyme, in informing himselfe of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiours
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:12171:242"/>
of the people and Clergy, of the necessiryes of the poore to relieue them, in &amp; visiting and louingly comforting the sicke.</p>
               <p>But though he shewed himselfe most pittyfull and beneficiall to all, yet felt he a singular tendernes of affect towardes the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with leaprosy: he would goe into their Hospitalls in person, and after that in common he had giuen benigne consolations and fatherly aduises to that wretched people, he would approach to ech one in particular, and humbly inclining himselfe vnto them, he abhorred not to kisse their loathsome vlcers, and lastly refreshed them with conuenient almes. The Chauncellour of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> called <hi>VVilliam</hi> one day was present at such a spectacle, who being first a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonished at so great humility, and afterwards doubting some vaine glory in the Bishop, began to tempt him, with saying: S. <hi>Martin</hi> with a kisse only cured the leaprous, but you, me thinks, doe not so. Towhich iest of his, S. <hi>Hugh</hi> made answere: S. <hi>Martins</hi> kisse eured the leaprous in flesh, but the kisse of the leaprous euen cures my soule. He was wont also, most ordinarily to wash secretly the feet of thirteen poore folkes, and to serue them at table. And finally his workes of piety were so notable and famous, as he was univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally called the Father of Mercyes; and euen sucking Babes, as it were, through naurall instinct would stretch forth their little armes to call, and imbrace him.</p>

               <p>It happened one day, that he buryed a most stincking &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt corps of a drunken and dissolute sinner, to which none durst approach without stopping the nose; and yet <hi>S. Hugh</hi> went about to handle him without any auersion at all, vntill he had layd him and couered him with earth: the standers by being amazed therat demanded of him, whether he felt not any noysomnes or loathing from the corrupt corps, and he answering, that he felt no offensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenes thereat, and how they were deceaued with their owne ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination; being full with new wonder, they ceased not to glotify the diuine Goodnes in his Seruant.</p>
               <p>Newes being brought him one day, of the death of a bitter persecutour of his, he suddenly puts himselfe in order to goe vnto that house of mourning, and to be present at the hearse: and being told for certaine, there were traynes layd for him on the way, and therefore by no meanes he should go thither: I deserue well, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, answered he, to haue fetters at my feet, and bolts on my legges, if I should once but neglect such a visit.

               <p>How acceptable these and the like exercises of <hi>S.

Moreouer it had taken vp a custome, as often as the Bishop was to retyre thither, to be very iocund, to cry out, and flap with the wings, in so much as the keepers of the castle, as they had been aduertized by some harbinger, would be accited thereby to prepare the chambers, and to put all things in order a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his coming.

               <p>IN those dayes was assembled at <hi>Lincolne,</hi> a most famous nationall Councell: and S. <hi>Hugh</hi> being then in the Citty of <hi>London,</hi> vpon vrgent occasion, with purpose to hye himselfe as soone as possibly he could to the sayd Assembly, being there ouertaken by a suden &amp; vehement feuer, was forced to keep his bed; and yet in despite of the disease, re-enforcing his prayers vnto God, and to the most blessed Virgin, and deuout colloquyes with his Angell Guardian, and with the Citizens of <hi>Heauen;</hi> he ceased not withall to afford gratefull audience, with holsome admonitions to as many as came to visit him. Being admonished to make his will: It greiues mee (said he) for this custome of making wils, introduced into the clergy. I neuer had, nor haue at this present any thing, that is not wholy of my Church: and yet that the Fiscall may not lay hand thereon, let all be distributed to the poore, as soone as may be, whatsoeuer
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:12171:244"/>
may seeme to others I possesse. Heereupon the Feast of <hi>S. Mathew</hi> being come, wherein he remembred he was consecrated Bishop; he caused the celestiall Viatique, and the Sacrament of Extreme vnction also to be ministred to him, as thinking very probably, that immediately he was to depart: but it pleased our Lord to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the same, vntill the 17. day of the next moneth, in which space he ceased not from deuotious for himselfe, and exhortations for others; and moreouer with the spirit of Prophecy, very cleerely foretold, the great disasters, which soone after, were to happen to that Kingdome, and particulerly to the Clergy.</p>
               <p>The foresayd terme being afterwards arriued, the holy Bishop being interiourly certifyed of his departure, caused besides his Chaplyns some Monks and Preists to be called to assist him, and seeing them all to weep bitterly, he sought with interrupted speeches, but graue and affectuous withall to comfort them, and laying his right hand vpon ech one, he recommended them to the diuine custody. And now his feeble voyce began quite to fayle, when he willed, that the flore being swept, a crosse of hallowed ashes should be formed thereon, and that a seruice should be sayd in manner of a Quier, whereat being present with great attention, as soone as he came to that verse of the 90. Psalme: <hi>Clamabit ad me &amp; ego exaudiui cum, cum ipso sum in tribulatione,</hi> causing himselfe to be lifted from his bed, he stretehed his withered and frozen mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers (being mindfull of the Passion of Christ) vpon the sayd Crosse, and presently beginning the Canticle of <hi>Simeon</hi> very happily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, in the yeare of our Lord 1200. of his age 60. and of his Episcopall charge the 15.</p>
               <p>In this manner it pleased the Prince of Pastours, to put an end to the trauailes of his most faythfull Coadiutour, of whose pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage into heauen some persons worthy of credit haue had vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted reuelation.

who then were present, came forth to meet them with a most noble trayne, and both being desirous to submit their shoulders to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Beer, the <hi>Scottish</hi> King among others (who loued him deerely) powred forth a floud of teares. After that, in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall were the solemne exequies celebrated, with the pompe that became both the dignity of the deceased, &amp; the quality of the standers by, among which two crowned heads, three Archbishops, fourteene Bishops, more then a hundred Abbots, very many Earles and Barons, drew the eyes of the people vpon them; the diuine Prouidence so disposing, that the promptnes and perseuerance of S. <hi>Hugh</hi> in taking so great care to bury the bodyes of others, was thus recompenced with so magnificent and glorious a Sepulture. To this were added for greater splendour, new &amp; famous miracles, which to recount throughout, were a thing too long: it may suffice for example only to add heere also, that within few dayes at his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument, were cured six Palsey men, three blind receaued their sight, and two dumbe men recouered their speach. Moreouer the deposition, customes, and heroicall prowesse of the Saint, were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards not only celebrated with a liuely voice, by that age, but by many Writers also registred with a faythfull pen, to the glory of God, the memory of him, and the noble example, &amp; incitement to posterity.</p>

From so noble a couple, in the flower of their youth sprung forth
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:12171:246"/>
this blessed Bud, and in Baptisme was named <hi>Hernando.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the first rudiments of learning and Christian manners, he was with diligence instructed by the Priestes of the sayd great Church; so as an exact education being added to an excellent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, vnder the protection of the most Blessed Virgin Mary, and that most inuincible Martyr, he came very soone to bring forth most euident signes of his future greatnes: because, as it is likewise reported of some others elected of God in their childish age, being farre off from childish thoughtes, he tooke pleasure in imitation of his Parents, to frequent holy places, and to distribute almes to the poore, as he was able, that saying of <hi>Iob</hi> well suiting with him: <hi>Ab infantia mea, creuit mecum miseratio.</hi> With these passages of his childish innocency, being come to the dangerous &amp; ticklish point of youth in choice of an estate of life, he felt himselfe not a little to be allured by sensuality, with enticements of flatteryes: but preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued doubtles by the diuine Mercy, very generously withdrew his foot, resolued to follow by the sharp way, the guide of reason, and splendour of honesty.</p>
               <p>And to secure himselfe the better, with perseuerance, with a voluntary holocaust he dedicated himselfe to our Sauiour Iesus Christ, in the Monastery of S. <hi>Vincent</hi> of the Chanons-Regular: which Monastery howbeit scituate forth of <hi>Lisbone,</hi> yet was it not so farre, but many, as it happens some for loue, some for curiosity, came to visit the new souldiour of Christ: whence he perceauing himselfe to be disturbed in his deuout exercises, obtayned with much difficulty to be remoued from thence, some three dayes iourney, into the Monastery of the <hi>Holy Crosse</hi> of <hi>Conimbria,</hi> where yet to this day that Order flourisheth, to the great benefit and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of that Citty. Heere the feruorous disciple of Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the learning and diligent obseruing the holy Ceremonyes, so imployed himselfe in the grauer studyes, as he alwayes reserued the better part of his tyme and trauaile for spirit: nor suffered he (as often it fals out with they vnaduised) the vehemency of specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should come to oppresse or diminish deuotion, but with a sage temper, helping himselfe with the sacred Scriptures, partly for finding out of deep senses, partly to enflame himselfe with diuine loue, and making no lesse often acts of the Will, then of the Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, he arriued within a little while, to so high a degree of perfection, as he had no greater thirst, then to spend his bloud for

And by this way had sought with all industry to prouide for the extreme necessityes of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Christianity.

               <p>Into which enterprize hauing put himselfe more then once, but through diuers impediments, being not able euer to prosecute any thing; at last, assembling together, two squadrons of choyce workemen, with one of Eleuen, he himselfe passed from <hi>Ancona</hi> into <hi>Egipt,</hi> where vnder <hi>Damiata,</hi> the Christian army was encamped against the <hi>Saracens:</hi> the other of Six, he sent vnder <hi>Fryer Vitalis</hi> an <hi>Italian,</hi> into the land of <hi>Granata,</hi> and of <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> being tiranically handled by <hi>Miramolinus</hi> King of <hi>Morocco,</hi> a great vpholder of the name and sect of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> These two expeditions concerning the litle fruit they wrought, with those blind and obstinate people, had in a manner the same successe: but for the dealing with Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall persons they were farre different.

Some two of this Conuent, from tyme to tyme, were wont to come to the sumptuous and rich Monastery of the holy <hi>Crosse,</hi> according to their institute, very humbly to craue Almes: So as <hi>Don Hernando,</hi> taking them one day aside, with a liuely affect of Charity vnfolded vnto them, as to two Angells of Paradise, his holy purpose, and besought them, keeping it secret where need was, to deale with their Superiours, about his admission into their Order, but yet with expresse condition to send him by obedience, as soone as may be vnto the land of the <hi>Moores,</hi> to worke some fruit in the conuersion of <hi>Gentils.</hi> Euen from that tyme, was the name of <hi>Hernando</hi> famous for learning and goodnes; so as the <hi>Fryars Minors,</hi> tooke it to be no small fauour so to enrich themselues with such a purchase. Wherefore the busynes being concluded on their parts; on the other <hi>Don Hernando</hi> began to craue humble licence of his Prelates, who made a very strong resistance for a tyme; but his prayers were so continuall and vehement as they finally preuayled. So as deuoutly taking the habit of <hi>S. Francis</hi> from the <hi>Minous</hi> in their Cloyster, he went his wayes thence with such displeasure of the Chanons, as he heard at his going forth, such a bitter taunt in the way of iest cast forth by one of them, as this: <hi>Goe your wayes now, perhaps you will be a Saint in that Religion.</hi> At which words (sayd he) with a cheerefull countenance: <hi>VVhen that shall be, I beleiue you will giue praise and thanks to the Redeemer for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this manner passing into a new habitation and institute; the first thing he did, was to lay aside all secular habits, and quite to forget his fathers house, &amp; to be also himselfe the more vnknowne, and quite forgotten of the world, from the title of that litle Church, or to say better, Oratory of the <hi>Minors,</hi> in changing his name, he caused himselfe to be called <hi>Fryar Antony.</hi> From thence renewing
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:12171:248"/>
his supplications to God, and his Superiours, and preparing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe continually with fit meditations, to each cruelty of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that might be, it was not long ere he was sent into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired parts of <hi>Marocco;</hi> where as in a most certaine field of battayle, he hoped to obteyne by dying for Christ, a glorious victory.</p>
               <p>But soone appeared very euident signes of the inscrutable dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of our Lord; who accepting herein the good will of his serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, had preordeyned him for other labours, and to other merits. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, that in the very beginning of his departure, being oppressed with a greiuous malady, he was constreyned for the most of that winter to keepe his bed. Where, though after many profers and endeuours made in vayne, he coniectured, the diuine Maiesty was no wayes propitious to his purposes; yet by the beginning of the next yeare, hauing scarcely recouered any forces, he valiantly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan afresh to make proofe of himselfe, and to sayle towards <hi>Affrick.</hi> But the barke had hardly hoysed sayle &amp; departed from the hauen, when behold a contrary storme of the South-west winds, by force, transported the Mariners to <hi>Messina</hi> of the Iland of <hi>Sicily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This aduenture gaue S. <hi>Anthony</hi> much more matter to reflect vpon the interpretation of the diuine will, and had yet a more eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent signe therof. As soone as he landed he vnderstood by the <hi>Fryars Minors</hi> there resident, how of late a generall Chapter was intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Order, at <hi>Assistum,</hi> and therefore it apperteyned to him also, as a Preist, not hindered by any lawfull cause to goe thither. Through this citation ioyned with passed accidents, he came to be satisfyed, it was not the diuine pleasure he should aspire to preach to the Mahometans or Gentils. From which barre of exclusion, the wary Merchant went about to make a double profit, one of his owne confusion, accusing himselfe of too much boldnes, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption in himselfe; the other of a stable purpose, to suffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe heereafter to be wholy guided by the Creatour, by meanes of his Ministers; without making choyce on his owne head, of this or that manner of procuring the diuine glory. And withall, since it was not permitted him to expose himselfe for the holy fayth, vnto the fury of the people, to the cruelty of Tyrants, to the scourges &amp; kniues of the mercyles hangmen, he determined to offer vp him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, another way to Christ, in a liuing hoast, vpon the aul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>S. <hi>Antony</hi> going with such designes in his breast vnto the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of <hi>Assisium,</hi> since by reason of his celebrating of Masse euery day, and reciting the canonicall howers, his Priestly dignity could not be hidden, he endeauoured at least with all care to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale the nobility of his bloud, the force of his wit, and the variety of learning which he had; which so cunningly he did, as with the whole Chapter, he remayned in opinion of an Idiot or simple man, and not apt, eyther for subtilityes of speculatiue learning, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of practicall matters. Whence it followed, that the assembly being dissolued, while distribution of subiects (according to the vse) was made, and the Superiours requiring to haue some this, some that man, along with them vnto their residences, S. <hi>Antony</hi> remayned alone without being required or requested of any.

               <p>IT was now the tyme of Ecclesiasticall Ordinations; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Father Guardian hauing destined some Fryars to the Citty of <hi>Forli,</hi> he thought good to lead them thither in person himselfe, &amp; would needs haue S. <hi>Antony</hi> also along with him being Priest alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as we haue sayd; and as reason dictats vnto vs, and the Portugall Chronicles themselues doe cleerely demonstrate, howsoeuer more moderne Authours being mooued by one ambiguous word only of <hi>Surius,</hi> haue after affirmed, that <hi>S. Anthony</hi> went thither to be enrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the others into the sacred warfare. With this family then, for the same effect, went some Dominicans a long like wise: a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion instituted as it were, by the eternall Father at the same tyme of the Franciscans, for the greater help of the Catholicke Church, and for supply, of men for the continuall preaching of the word of God.</p>
               <p>These two companyes, though diuerse in habit and meanes, yet in will and end very conformable, being come to <hi>Forli,</hi> were lodged both in the same place: and not for to giue ouer their spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall exercises, the houre of their conferences arriued, the Guardian of the Minours made great instance to the Father of the Preachers, that according to their institute they would be pleased, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon consolation to discourse something of matters concerning the diuine seruice, and for the purchase of vertues. Whereof those ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Fathers excusing themselues, through the shortnes of tyme, &amp; wearynes of the iourney; the Guardian being doubtlesse touched
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:12171:249"/>
with some hidden inspiration from Heauen, contrary to the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all, turned himselfe to S. <hi>Antony,</hi> and suddenly imposed vpon him to make them a Homily, and to say something of edification. To which precept the seruant of Christ very modestly opposed a while, but the Superiour and the rest vrging him to it, at last not to breake with Obedience, recommending himselfe to God, he began to discourse, but rudely at the beginning, and without any shew of learning in him; but in the progresse of the discourse, the Holy Ghost without doubt, so guiding his tongue and hart, ere he was aware, he entred into so great a variety of allegations of the diuine Scripture, into so great sublimenesse of mystical senses, &amp; aboue al, into so great an accesse and ardour of charity (which euen cast forth flames from his countenance and gesture) as all the Auditours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned partly inflamed with heauenly affects, partly also astoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with wonder, as of a man that knew no more then his Breuia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that neuer handled as it were any bookes, and from whose mouth scarcely euer came forth any Latin word.</p>
               <p>But he, to whome, as well the memory, as also the creature it selfe, serued as a Booke layd open, and in so long an intermission of study and reading, had yet neuer fayled from treating familiarly with the benigne Giuer of Wisdome, gaue forth to vnderstand in that act, how much richer are the treasures of the mystical &amp; sweet, then the scholasticall and sterile Theology. Besides their astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at this so sudden an eloquence, such indeed as all confessed they had neuer heard the like; they had a singular esteeme &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration at his so rare humility, since whereas others, hauing scarce got a smatch in learning, can hardly conteyne the vnbridled will from appearing in Pulpits, and hunting after vayne prayse and applause of the people: he though very well instructed already, with infused and purchased learning, and besides endued by nature, with those parts which are required in a Christian Oratour, had euer held his peace, &amp; was euer more willing to heare then speake, and striued as much to abase himselfe, as others doe to procure high degrees, and to be notable and famous in the world.</p>
               <p>It was not long ere the Blessed Father S. <hi>Francis</hi> had newes thereof, who tooke extraordinary contentment therein, and gaue infinite thankes therefore to the diuine Goodnes. And howbeit he might without more adoe haue deputed S. <hi>Antony</hi> vnto the holy Function of Preaching, as who had beene well studyed already of
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:12171:250"/>
himselfe; yet by reason of his so long intermission now from his said studyes, and not to giue matter of murmure vnto others, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to make him renew and refine his mystical Theology, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the direction of the Abbot of <hi>S. Andrew</hi> in <hi>Vercells,</hi> a man very famous in those dayes for learning and sanctity, and who among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther signes of profound Science, had lately translated the workes of <hi>S.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to this Doctour, with another English Fryar called <hi>Adam de Marisco,</hi> within the space of a yeare, they both made such profit in the knowledge of celestiall things, and arriued to such a height and eleuation of mind, as it seemed to the sayd Maister, he had two Angells in his howse, and that he had learned of them rather then they of him. With this so happy successe, S. <hi>Francis</hi> was more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in his opinion already conceiued of S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> and with great hope, of much profit to the world, declared him Preacher, &amp; commaunded him very confidently henceforth to apply himselfe to the ministery of the Word or God.</p>

               <p>THis excellency of preaching, was not only discouered in the blessed disciple of Christ; but as true humility is capable of all graces, and mother of all vertues, he shewed himselfe very soone, how exceeding sufficient he was for confessions, and apt withall for disputations against Heretikes, and for Scholastical chayres, &amp; for writing of bookes very profitable for the whole posterity, and (being a thing very hardly to be coupled with such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>) he shewed likewise no small skill and dexterity in gouernment. To all which prerogatiues, as by an irrefragable seale and patent, the diuine Clemency had annexed the spirit of Prophecy, with the priuiledge of frequent and manifest miracles. Of ech one of which guifts according to our purpose, we shall declare the cheife of them with breuity.</p>
               <p>And first, for his preaching, we must know, there was so bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a zeale of the glory of God, and the saluation of men, planted by inch solid and deep rootes in the soule of this louer of Christ, as that being suddenly pushed forth of his stand, like a generous
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:12171:250"/>
steed, he began to discurre through villages, Boroughes, castles, and Cittyes, leauing steps imprinted of holy customes on all sides, and exciting miserable mortalls, from base and terrene cares, to high and celestiall thoughts. And this his zeale of Charity, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauoured allwayes to keepe liuely and flaming, with the breath of prayer, and with matter of consideration, keeping also it from all humidity of sensuall pleasures or disordinate affections. Whence followed among others, two inestimable aduantages, to wit, a great credit with the auditory, and a singular energy of discourse: the one of which conditions, more auayles to perswade with, then all the artificiousnes, and figures of Rethoricall art that may be: the other how behouefull for a Teacher of truth, and Embassadour of the King of Heauen, may be easely comprehended of euery one.</p>
               <p>By this meanes he came to be free and rid of those bands, which are wont to inueagle the mind, or restrayne and tye the tongue of others. So as neyther the force, nor malignity of the Mighty was able to dismay him, nor flatteryes or offers of freinds to bow him, nor the winds of popular applause to puffe him vp. Without all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of persons, as well in publike according to occasions, as in priuate, the magnanimous Interpreter and Messenger of Christ, ceased not to hammer &amp; breake the wils growne obdurate in vices, and that with a presence of a couragious hart, as that many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Preachers, who came to hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Which thinges to be no whit exaggerated, nor feigned may sufficiently be seen by that, which happened to him, with that famous Tyrant <hi>Ezelinus,</hi> of the Citty of <hi>Padua,</hi> and of a great part of <hi>Marea Treuisana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This man vnder a rationall figure, hauing the hart of a Beare, and Tigre, seemed to thirst for nothing more then human bloud. Persidiousnes and impiety both, were in him as conuerted into na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: robberyes, rapines, destructions through fire &amp; sword, were euen sports and recreations to him, and (as to the Captayns of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs it happens) he was allwayes wayted on by Souldiours and Sergeants, neyther in auarice, nor cruelty, nor lust much inferiour to him.

               </p>
               <p>These thinges the Seruant of God vpbrayded him with to his face, first in generall, and then after in particuler, descending into circumstances, with so much vehemency of spirit, with so much sparckling of the eyes, &amp; feruour withal, and with so much weight and liberty of speach, as that most rauenous Wolfe became now of a sudden a most meeke Lambe, &amp; in the presence of as many as were there, pulling off his girdle with his owne handes, &amp; putting it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his necke, cast himselfe at his feet, very humbly crauing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, both of God and him, and offering himselfe most ready to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme whatsoeuer pennance the Venerable Father should impose vpon him. Whereupon the Blessed <hi>Antony</hi> being somewhat pacify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the penitent confirmed with sweet admonitions in his good purposes, not only without any hurt at all, but rather with a great deale of reputation and honour, and grace withal, came from him: the people remayning the while much admiring, and amazed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond measure, how <hi>Ezelinus</hi> at the first sound of such rebukes and reprehensions, had not caused him to be hewed in peeces, and cast forth to the beasts with a looke only. To take away the wonder, he yet wholy confounded, and euen pale for feare, sayd: Let it not seeme strange to you my Maisters, what heere I haue done, because while that same Religious man spake in that manner, I manifestly saw most liuely rayes of diuine splendour to come from his face, which so dazeled me, &amp; filled me with such feare, that euen doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les me thought, I should euen haue beene swallowed into hell. These wordes indeed <hi>Ezelinus</hi> spake, and such feelings he shewed for the present: but as the promises proceeded from seruile feare, &amp; not for the loue of vertue, after a short remorse, returned the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous wretch to his former custome, accusing himselfe for hauing yielded so basely, to the boldnes and menaces of a presumptuous Fryer, and perhaps also a dissembler and hypocrite. Yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, remained that more then humaine countenance so engrauen in his memory, and that Maiesty, wherewith he was terrifyed,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:12171:251"/>
as to him it seemed very hard to belieue, that without some hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly concourse, and the hidden merites of so couragious a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hender, so strange and vnusuall a thing should befall him.</p>
               <p>After the Tyrant had beene thus perplexed in mind a prety while, wauering in himselfe, he resolued at last to cleare himselfe in that point of the goodnes &amp; sincerity of the Fryer, with the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone as followes. Taking then forth of his treasury a rich Iewell, he gaue it to some Ruffians, of his, to carry it to S. <hi>Antony</hi> on his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, with faire and amorous speaches, but with expresse order, that if he accepted the same, as a false &amp; couetous man, they should suddenly hew him to peeces: and if he should refuse it, they should with all respect abstaine, as from a person truly holy and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God; nor for whatsoeuer he should say vnto them, they should take any reuenge vpon him, but without any reply at all returne backe againe. With such commission those Russians being come to S. <hi>Antony,</hi> and intreating him with the greatest courtesy they could, to accept of that small charity, which <hi>Ezelinus</hi> sent him, and to remember him only in his deuout prayers; by so liuely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience they presently knew what he was, since with a seuere looke &amp; shew of anger, he thus answered to the message: God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, I receaue in signe of liberality the very bloud of the poore of Christ: for which shall <hi>Ezelinus,</hi> ere he be aware thereof, make an exact accompt to the diuine iustice: and get you hence also with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay, least through your iniquityes eyther the howse ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelme vs with a sudden ruine, or the earth come to swallow vs vp with a horrible rupture.</p>
               <p>Whereat those miserable wretches, with bowing downe the head, went silently and fearefully away to giue account to their wicked maister of the whole successe; who being cleared in this manner of the suspitions falsely conceaued by him, touching the seruant of God, from that tyme forwards held him in the esteeme he ought, and gaue order to his souldiers, they should let him say of him what he listed himselfe: and though the Tyrant, through his inueterate custome in sinning, was neuer conuerted from his lewd wayes, yet certaine it is, that the memory of S. <hi>Antony</hi> serued him often tymes for a bridle, and through feare and reuerence of so great a man, he forbare afterwardes to commit many outrages, which he had otherwise effected without respect. These then and the like assaults, the couragious Champion of Christ, would not

fayle to make at any tyme when need required. Though indeed no merueyl it be, that for the defence of the truth, he should not feare the face of any man how angry soeuer, who with so much desire heretofore had sought to drinke of the chalice of the passion.</p>

And how beyt the principall foundation of his preaching was placed, as we haue sayd, in frequent prayer, and continuall abne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of himselfe; neuerthelesse he tooke light and nourishment of sound and sincere knowledge from the auncient Doctours, sacred Councells, and diuine Scriptures, wherein he was so versed and dexterous, as it is affirmed for certaine, that when by any misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, they might hap to be lost, he alone from the Cabinet of his memory, was sufficient to recouer them agayne, as heeretofore <hi>Esdras</hi> had done, and to put them faythfully in writing.</p>
               <p>Wherof among other persons of authority, <hi>Gregory</hi> the Ninth his Holynes, gaue truely a most cleere and graue testimony; for that S. <hi>Antony</hi> being come to the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> (for this likewise was a notable exployt of his) to oppose the designes and endeuoure of Fryar <hi>Elias,</hi> and of others, who sought to wrest the Rule, and enlarge the Religious discipline, he not only laboured efficaciously in this matter, but preached also to the Court, and people of <hi>Rome,</hi> in diuers places and tymes, with so great abundance of true and profund conceipts, with such subtilityes, and art in discouering the origens and causes of vices, and in appling apt remedyes to each one, and with such sharpe and sound interpretations of the Psalmes and the Prophets, and of all historyes &amp; Oracles, and diuine precepts as the Pope himselfe being astonished, besides infinite other prayses afforded him, with a Pontificall spirit daigned to call him, <hi>The Arke of the Testament.</hi> There were added to these so rare guifts of a Christian Oratour, a dignity of aspect, a grace in his gestures, á sweetenes and cleernes of voyce, and all in so eminent a degree,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:12171:252"/>
as he seemed to be an organ for honest delectation, and for a hole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some mouing of soules, framed by the hand of God himselfe. And that which more increased the wonder, was so great a variety, quaintnes, and propriety in the Italian tongue, in a man trayned vp in Prouinces so remote, and come into <hi>Italy</hi> being of yeares so mature, and so late brought forth to the light of the world, and to the eminency of Pulpits.</p>
               <p>Whence it is not very easy to explicate the concourse of people of all conditions, that assembled together at the sound of that cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall harmony and diuine Trumpet: in shutting vp their shopps, leauing their traffikes in the market places, and the noyses of the Pallace, and taking vp places before day at the sacred audience, with such hast and strife withall, as many tymes the seruant of God was constreyned to abandon the Churches and Cittyes, and goe forth into the spacious playnes, and there from the higher bancks to breake the bread of the diuine word vnto the hungry multitude. And he howbeyt corpulent by nature, and much subiect to swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and diuers infirmityes, left not for all that, to expose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with great promptnes, and without sparing any labour, or trouble where the greatest need was, &amp; hope of a more certaine &amp; copious haruest.</p>
               <p>Now who were able to set downe what fruite followed, to the glory of our Lord and saluation of men? Who could number the rancours and enmityes deposed, the restitutions made, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines forsaken, the processions, disciplines, fasts, the pious works both common and particuler instituted for behoofe of body &amp; soule? Many contemning the vanity of the world, though rich and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent otherwise, eyther dedicated themselues to the diuine seruice in Religion, or the better to assure their conscience, very freely sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected their whole substance and their life it selfe, vnto the dispose of the faythfull seruant of Christ; the good and faythfull through his discourses would depart from him very full of consolation of new courage and purpose afresh. The sinners chasing away dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and sleep, astonished at the diuine prouidence, acknowledging their perilous estate, and the greiuousnes of their synnes, as woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Harts to the fountayne, so ran they to the tribunall of Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours, with teares and sighs.</p>

               <p>VVE may not seeme to passe ouer in silence, how 22. Thee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues being accustomed to rob and murder trauaylours in a certaine thick and obscure forest, and then after vnknowne in the Citty, to appeare in the habit of Honourable persons, being lastly moued with the fame, which ran euery where of the Angelicall preaching of S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> resolued to goe all at once to heare him. And found the report of him to be nothing false, but rather remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned so mollifyed and softned, at his fyery speaches, as the sermon being hardly finished, they went al one after another, to cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues at the feet of the Preacher, with most humble confession, crauing absoluion at his hands, and promising amendment. Of whome being graciously heard, and with fatherly admonitions being encouraged and instructed, they retired themselues to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the pennances imposed vpon them.</p>
               <p>By which example, may easely be estimated without more ado, how great, and how vnusuall effects, that instrument of the diuine goodnes occasioned in the harts of men. So as S. <hi>Bonauenture</hi> in the second translation of the Saint, which was some thirty two yeares after his death, finding that happy tongue, through the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine will, wholy fresh and red, with good reason exclaymed: O <hi>tongue, which hast euer blessed God, and taught others to blesse him like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, it appeares now manifestly of what merit thou wast before our Lord:</hi> and so kissing it deuoutly he placed it in a decent Reliquary, for that purpose. But returning to the matter of the spirituall purchase, and most burning zeale of S. <hi>Antony.</hi> It is surely a merueilous thing, how the man of God, notwithstanding the occupation of the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, and other trauayls of no light importance, employed himselfe very willingly in hearing confessions, and with so much prudence, and longanimity applyed himselfe to looke into, and to cure the wounds of soules, as sometymes from morning, to late in the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, he had no tyme to restore his weary and afflicted body eyther with meate, or repose at all.</p>
               <p>The Heretikes moreouer and the Heresiarks being manifestly conuinced by the wisedome and spirit that spake in him, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streyned ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly eyther with base silence to confesse their perfidious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or with wholesome compunction to accept the truth.

Which perticularly is seen in the Citties of <hi>Arimini, Millan,</hi> &amp; <hi>Tholouse.</hi> From which things grew also another effect of no small consideration, as well for the common benefit of all Christendome, as for the especiall increase and reputation of the <hi>Fryars Minors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The sayd Religion, as we mentioned, was lately founded by the most Blessed <hi>Father S. Francis,</hi> in profession and spirit, rather of Christian pouerty and humility, then of erudition or learning. Which though they were not despised, or in contempt with him, yet was he very circumspect and cautious in admitting them into his Institute, being desirous that his Fryars should preach rather with example and good works, then with precepts, and words: nor lightly would he giue them leaue to study, as fearing not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good reason, least through weakenes of humane nature, much reading might extinguish deuotion, and the wind of curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity destroy the building of Charity. From this caution of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, and simplicity which commonly appeared in his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, sprang vp an vniuersal opinion in the world, that the Fryars were certainely but silly, and good men only; but ignorant meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and litle apt for discouering the deceipts of the auncient aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, and iudging the quality of synnes, or distinguishing between leaprosy and leaprosy, and by consequence vnable to cooperate with the diuine prouidence in the conducting of soules.</p>
               <p>Now some Fathers being desirous to cancell this note, as zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of the fame of their Order, and of the glory of Christ, made great instance vnto the Blessed <hi>Antony,</hi> he would take the paynes to read and explicate the more grauer sciences, and set vp in the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the <hi>Minors</hi> a Schoole also, whence as from a noble and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall Seminary, might issue from tyme to tyme sufficient worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for the Vinyard of our Lord. To which so honest requestes, howbeit otherwise he would willingly haue condescended, yet hauing some notice of the mind of his common Father and Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, he could neuer be brought to accept the enterprise, vntill such tyme, as he had expresse faculty and commission from him, with a letter of the tenour following: To his most deere Brother <hi>Antony, Fryar Francis</hi> sends greeting. I am content that you read Diuinity to
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:12171:254"/>
the Fryars, but in such sort, that (according to the aduise of the Rule) neither in you or them, the spirit of holy Prayer may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished.</p>
               <p>Heereby, all excuse being taken away, S. <hi>Antony</hi> did at last begin to satisfy the continuall desires of the Fryars, and he was the first, who in that, venerable Family euer held the Chayre; begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in <hi>Mompelier</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and prosecuting afterwardes in <hi>Bologna,</hi> and then in <hi>Padua.</hi> To which Citty, whether it were for the cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of the ayre, or for the humanity and disposition of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, he bare very speciall affection: and with this his new la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of interpreting the diuine mysteries, he came both to illustrate the Order of <hi>Minours,</hi> and to affoard the militant Church a fit sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of the choicest fouldiours. Amidst these so noble and fruitefull cares of his, the Seruant of Christ, could not also auoyd that same of gouerning others, in diuers degrees, and places of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> where he was (according to the institute of the Order) both Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian and Minister. In which dignityes, howbeit he shewed affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and such iudgment, as he was both reuerenced and beloued of his subiects: yet to the end he might more readily attend to spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall workes, and for the greater common good, it seemed well to Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the IX. through singular priuiledge, to discharge him of all superintendency of Conuents, or of Prouinces, which do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily bring with them diuers distractions and thoughts of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall matters. And besids the office of confessing, conuersing with the Neighbours, and preaching, the same Pope would haue him to put his sermons into writing, that the profit might not only deriue to the present and liuing, but euen also to the absent, and posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Whereupon retyring himselfe a new into the Citty of <hi>Padua,</hi> being a place for diuers occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s very apt for al exercise of learning, he went forward in putting those bookes to writing, which are now read in print, &amp; which to the studious of christian eloquence, serue as a copious and rich storehouse for any subiect whatsoeuer.</p>

               <head>A certaine Prophesy of <hi>S. Antony</hi> fullfilled, of one <hi>Philip</hi> a Martyr of Christ. <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.</head>
               <p>HItherto we haue spoken of the actions of the Saint, which are imitable of ech religious person. It remaynes now to touch some thing of the more admirable. And to begin with prophecy,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:12171:254"/>
whereof two no lesse certaine then famous predictions, sufficienly declare, how much this so precious a gemme shined in the blessed S. <hi>Antony.</hi> There being a woman at <hi>Assisium</hi> now ready to be brought to bed, she deuoutly recommended her selfe to his intercession, who for charityes sake had been to visit her. To which request, through the hidden instinct of God, he manifestly answered forthwith, she should be of good cheere, that she should haue a happy labour, and haue a sonne, and that which more imported, he was desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne by diuine prouidence, first, to be a glasse of vertue in the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of <hi>S. Francis,</hi> and then also with effusion of his bloud, and greattorments, for Christ should purchase a palme of a glorious mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome. There was nothing of all this that infallibly fell not out. The happy Babe was borne without hurt of it selfe or mother, and in the sacred Baptisme, tooke the name of <hi>Philip.</hi> And passing his first yeares in Angelical purity, of his owne election became a <hi>Fryar Minour.</hi> Hence fortifying himselfe in the loue and feare of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall God, through a heauenly inspiration, was moued to the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage of the holy Land, and arriued at <hi>Azotus,</hi> euen iust at the tyme, when that Citty, was by treason taken by the <hi>Saracens,</hi> and the Christians that were there, to the number of two thousand, were all publiquely condemned to death.</p>
               <p>Through which so cruell a sentence, <hi>Philip</hi> fearing least some being affrighted might come to abandon the holy fayth, requested as a fauour at the ministers hands of the <hi>Souldan</hi> there (and obtayned it without difficulty) to be the last executed of all. Whence the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> being brought into some hope, that he would renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the meane tyme; found themselues at last to be far deceaued of their expectation. Because the cruell spectacle being now begun, <hi>Philip</hi> endeauoured with all feruour &amp; fortitude of mind to comfort all the Christians, to suffer freely, speaking aloud, he had a reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of our Lord, that he was to enter that day into the kingdome of Heauen, with more then a thousand Martyrs; through which so high a promise these faythfull people being exceedingly comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, did voluntarily, yea euen cheerfully present their bare necks, to the sword of the bloudy Executioner.</p>
               <p>Which thing the <hi>Souldan</hi> noting (who beyond measure abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the name of Christ) entered into such a fury, as he suddenly commaunded, that with all the sortes of most exquisite tormentes that might be, should his temerity and boldnes be punished, that
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:12171:255"/>
durst so disswade from the worship of the Great <hi>Mahomet.</hi> Whereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a troupe of hangmen, assailing <hi>Philip</hi> without more ado, and in the sight of the whole company of Christians, went first to cut of his fingars ioynt by ioynt, in which so sharp and prolix a torment, he neuer ceasing to exhort and enflame the Christians, in such wise as neyther being enforced with menaces, nor won with flatteryes, they all cryed out, with one accord, they would follow by all meanes the stepes, and counsails of the couragious <hi>Philip.</hi> The <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> continually more enraged, caused him to be fleaed aliue to the nauell, and afterwards that blessed tongue to be cut out, whereof being depriued &amp; torne in all parts, he ceased not for all that with signes and gestures, and much more with example to enflame those sacred victimes, vntill such tyme as he was beheaded with them, and that alltogether ascended to the eternall Country, leauing euen to their enemyes behind, an euident signe of their felicity, since the bodyes being kept a good while, in the same place vnburied &amp; vncouered did not only not giue forth the least ill sauour, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yeilded a most sweet odour.

               <head>Another example of <hi>S. Antonyes</hi> prophesyes, which happened in another Martyr. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.</head>
               <p>NO lesse memorable then the former, was a certaine reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which S. <hi>Antony</hi> manifested cleerely being Guardian at that tyme in the confines of <hi>Aquitan,</hi> in a Citty, which being in a more high place, the Frenchmen called <hi>Le Pay,</hi> and the vulgar Italian <hi>Val Poggio,</hi> and was aunciently by the Latins called <hi>Anicium.</hi> In this Citty among other Inhabitants, was a certaine Notary, very Catholike in fayth, the worldly in his dealinges, and more practized in taking of Suretyships, then discerning of spirits, more aquainted with plying the Iudges, and Aduocats, then frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Churches and Sacraments. And yet S. <hi>Antony</hi> on a tyme, meeting him one the way, with a low duck, &amp; vncouering of the head, made him an extraordinary reuerence and obeysance. Which thing the Notary, being guilty of his owne quality, and not tyed through any freindship to the poore Fryar; at first attributed the same to errour or simplicity, afterwards perceiuing him to persist
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:12171:255"/>
in the sayd obseruance, when he saw him a farre of, endeuoured to shunne him. But meeting full on a tyme where he could not auoyd him, and the <hi>Fryar</hi> saluting him againe with the accustomed, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with greater signe of honour then euer, he holding the same as an act of scorne and derision towards him, began with anger, euen grinding his teeth, and drawing out his sword withall, and to cry out, saying: If thou hadst not been a Fryar, I had now a good while since euen thrust this same in thy sides.</p>
               <p>But tell me, thou rude, base, and errant Iacke: What is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thou scoffes me thus to my face? To whome the seruant of Christ answered with all submission; Brother, trouble not your selfe, I do reuerence you with my hart, and do honour you withall fidelity that may be: the reason is, for that I hauing greatly desired, &amp; beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as a fauour of our Lord, to spend my bloud in his holy seruice, haue neuer been worthy, nor hath he byn pleased to heare my suite. But indeed of you, he hath reuealed to me, that you shal one day dye a Martyr; Whence I am constrayned with a sweet enuy, to hold you in the esteeme and regard I doe: and doe most affectuously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate you, that when you shall come to that glorious conflict, you would be mindfull of me poore wretched sinner. At which words the Notary being pacifyed, conuerting choler into laughter, went his wayes iesting at the matter. Nor long it was, but the effect did really succeed.</p>
               <p>Because the Bishop of that Citty, preparing himselfe to go vnto the holy Sepulcher, the Notary being touched with supernall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, resolued to accompany him thither, as he did.

In which conflict those barbarous people shewing themselues very bold and iusolent, against the honour of Christ, and the Bishop being timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in defending the same, and in opposing their blasphemyes; the Notary could by no meanes brooke such indignities, but couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously entred into the quarrell, &amp; without any respect a whit indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured to discouer &amp; accuse the vanity, fraud, &amp; ambitions of their wicked Mayster whome they adored: wherupon the <hi>Mahumetan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>THe apparitions of God, made to S <hi>Antony,</hi> &amp; of him to others, are worthy of eternall memory. Being one day receaued as a Ghest, by a certayne Knight, no lesse deuout then illustrious, he had a lodging appointed him, farre from noyse, where he might the better attend to study, and contemplation. Now, while the Knight passes in the night by the house, he sees a most bright splendour to proceed from that chamber, whereat meruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling much, he secretly approches to the doore, and looking through the key hole, beholds vpon an open booke before S. <hi>Antony,</hi> a child of a celestiall beauty; who sending forth rayes more bright then the Sunne, threw himselfe tenderly about the necke of the blessed man, and imbraced him without end, and S. <hi>Antony</hi> likewise him, with ineffable ioy and affection. Amidst these chast imbraces the most sweet Babe shewed him how his Host was standing at the doore, &amp; beheld al things remayning in a rapt. S. <hi>Antony</hi> not enuyed him so happy a sight, letting him enioy it at his pleasure, vntill such tyme as the glorious child did vanish away, when lastly he opened the doore, and with a thousand prayers coniured him to keep the matter in secret vntill his death. So promised the Knight and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued the same: and as soone as the Seruant of Christ was quit of the bandes of his body, he vnloosed the same of silence, and began to proclayme the aforesayd spectacle, and to affirme it with oaths and teares togeather, with so much gust as he could neuer be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed with recounting it. And hence it is, that the images of the Saint, are seene so depainted with a child in his armes, sitting on a booke, for a difference of others of his Order. In this manner was <hi>S. Antony</hi> among other tymes, as then made worthy of the presence of our Sauiour.</p>
               <p>And he also, as we sayd more then once, affoarded himselfe in seuerall places, vnto diuers persons at once, and that allwayes
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:12171:256"/>
eyther for the diuine seruice, or for edification, and the helpe of neighbours: as particulerly happened to him in <hi>France,</hi> while he was preaching first in <hi>Mompelier,</hi> in the great Church, after in <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moges</hi> in <hi>S. Peters,</hi> which they call of the <hi>Quadrino.</hi> Because S. <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> being in the pulpit, and remembring suddainely, he had forgot to substitute one in the Quire of the Conuent, who should supply his part, that belonged to him; suddenly by diuine power, not fayling neyther the people assembled, nor pulpit, was present with his Fryars to sing his Lesson, and Antiphone.</p>
               <p>At other tymes his Father being falsely accused in <hi>Lisbone,</hi> for intercepting the monyes of the Fiscall, and then agayne for killing a yonge man, which by certaine wicked men, was of purpose put into his garden with many signes of bloud vpon him, S. <hi>Antony</hi> in the meane while being certifyed by diuiue reuelation of what had happened at both tymes, from places and Prouinces most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, was found to be present in the same moment in the Citty of <hi>Lisbone;</hi> and as for the monyes he made the Magistrates to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that the Kings Treasurers, though fully satisfyed heertofore, yet maliciously had denyed the receipt thereof, and acquittances giuen. For the homicide, it pleased him to demaund it publique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the dead himselfe, whether his Father (though sentenced al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready for it) were guilty of the said wickednes: whereto hauing answered no, without the vrging of S. <hi>Antony</hi> to name the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactours, he demaunded absolution of the seruant of God, for a certayn excommunication he had formerly incurred, and interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for his synnes; which hauing obtayned in the sight of all the multitude, he fell downe dead into the sepulcher agayne.

               <p>Moreouer, the seruant of Christ, was wont to shew himselfe cleerly in the night in sleep, to some inueterated in sensuality, and other vices, who for feare or shame durst not to lay open their enormious synnes to the Priest, and vpbrayding them their of crymes, and circumstances thereof, now to admonish them with sweetnes, and now to constreyne them with seuerity and menaces, to repayre to this or that Confessour, as he esteemed most for the purpose, &amp; so with the Sacrament of penance they had tyme, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer themselues from the power of the diuell: which euen the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents themselues related afterwards, not without the great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayl

               <p>A Certaine Cittizen of <hi>Padua</hi> by name <hi>Leonard,</hi> confessing vnto him, among other iniquityes discouered, being very contrite, that he kickt his Mother on the belly so hard, as he threw her to the ground. For which the Saint reprehending him most grieuously, in processe of discourse sayd to him: How that foot which had had the boldnes to strike the belly, whence he came forth, deserued to be cut off. The wordes were not spoken to a deafe man: the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution receaued, <hi>Leonard</hi> goes his wayes home, and interpreting the sillables as they sounded, taking a hatchet really in hand, he cut off his foot, and presently being seised with a mortall sooning, began to cry out aloud; to these cryes the vnfortunate Mother full of feare came suddenly in, the Chirurgians are sent for, the wound is swathed with little hope of remedy or cure, the neighbours run in, one cryes, another weepes, all are astonished.</p>
               <p>The wofull woman, scarcely yet recouering breath, goes her wayes with her haire disheueled to the Saint, and with woma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish plaints, &amp; bitter sobs, charges him with the death of her deare sonne. The Blessed <hi>Antony,</hi> with the newes thereof remayned ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely disconsolate and afflicted, and not content to haue dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himselfe with iust excuses, he went immediatly to the lodging of that simple man, and there sending vp enflamed prayers to God, he tooke vp the foot cut off, and laying it to the stump of the legge, with the benediction of God so vnited the same, as the yonge man without griefe or scarre remayned safe and sound. The fame of so great a miracle dilated it selfe throughout, and thankes were ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to the diuine goodnes on all sides. These and other such like shinges befell <hi>S.

passe, how the <hi>Crusado</hi> for the holy Land being proclaymed, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Gregory</hi> the IX. and a most ample Iubiley published for such an intention in <hi>Rome,</hi> there assembled together an infinite number of people from all parts of Christendome, as Greeks, French, Almans, Spaniards, English, and of other nations: by all which, the blessed S. <hi>Antony</hi> was heard to preach at once, ech one in their proper lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, as in the Citty of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> heeretofore the Apostles were heard on the solemne day of Pentecost; that supernaturall effect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing renewed, with the astonishment of as many as heard the same.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Arimini,</hi> the Citty being full of Heretikes, <hi>S. Antony</hi> ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured cheifly, and not without much trauayle to reduce the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resiarcke <hi>Bonuillus,</hi> or (as some would haue it) <hi>Bonellus</hi> to a better mind, who for thirty yeares continuallly had persecuted the Church of Christ: and after his amendment, notwithstanding many others yet remayning most peruerse in their obstinacy, and shutting their ears vnto the truth, after that <hi>S. Antony</hi> with many prayers in vayne, had inuited them to a Sermon, there being a great number of them as then forth of the wals, where the riuer called <hi>Marechia</hi> discharges it selfe into the Sea; with great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence in our Lord, he begins to call the Fishes vnto the word of God, since men of reason &amp; redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with his precious bloud, would by no meanes seeme to harken to him. And incredible thing had it not been euident: he had scarce giuen forth the commaund, when an innumerable multitude of fishes of sundry formes and bignes, were seene to appeare on the waters of the Sea and riuer, which euen of their owne accord came in by sholes, and with heads erected accommodating themselues to listen to him; in so much as the lesser put themselues neer to the bancks side, and then the greater and bigger in order, with so good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fayre a dispose, as a more pleasing sight could not be seen.</p>
               <p>To these squadrons so well ordered, the blessed <hi>S. Antony</hi> lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp his voyce began to vnfold vnto them the benefits vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed them from the Creatour, the guift of swiftnes and colours, and of their beauty in particuler; the medicine subministred from them by <hi>Toby;</hi> the tribute, and food of our Lord himselfe: the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the Resurrection represented in the Prophet <hi>Ionas.</hi> For which reasons with many others besides did <hi>S.

and shewing a will to honour the messenger of Christ. Nor would they depart from the place, vntil they were lice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced thence, through his holy benediction. And so in the meane tyme the concourse of spectatours being now continually growne greater; the man of God taking then occasion, vpbrayded those obstinate and peruerse men of their malice and impiety, since in acknowledging the high Creatour, admitting so his holy law, they would so manifestly suffer themselues to be vanquished by beasts; whereupon the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes at last remayned confounded, and the Catholikes conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually more confirmed, in the holy doctrine and veneration of the Sea Apostolike.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And now to speake something likewise of meruails succeeding in his disputations with Heretikes: It is reported for certayne, how the diuine man being at <hi>Arimini</hi> on a tyme, or as others would haue it, in the Citty of <hi>Tholouse,</hi> a malapert minister of Sathan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Sect of <hi>Berengarius,</hi> being not able to maintayne himselfe in a controuersy of the most holy Sacrament, agaynst the reasons alleadged by <hi>S.

But let vs come to some more cleere experiences in effect; Whence I may be certifyed indeed, that God is really present in the consecrated host, and I promise and sweare vnto you (when it shall succeed) that I will confesse to be vanquished, and belieue this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, in the manner as you teach it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Anthony</hi> accepts the condition, nor doubts awhit to put the quality of the tryall to his owne choice. Let vs do it then in this manner replyed the Heretike. This day will I beginne to keep my Mule without meate, &amp; after three dayes againe shall I bring him forth so hungry into the market place, togeather with a pecke of oats for the purpose. And at the same tyme thou likewise come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with thy azime or host, and if the beast in presence of the one and other shall forbeare to eate the oats, and turne to bow vnto thy bread, I am content also to adore the same, without more adoe.

               <p>SOme others of the same kind with the former, found out ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more wicked proofe, and by so much more dangerous, as more hidden; who being not wone with the former passage, but more exasperated rather with the sayd miracle, determined with poyson to murder the seruant of Christ. Inuiting him therefore to dinner (whither he refused not to goe, being desirous to help any manner of wayes) vnder colour of charity, they present him with poysoned meat; which fraud being suddenly knowne in spirit, he reprehended them with loue &amp; grauity for such impiety: but those obstinate and peruerse men, insteed of being compunct, and peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent therat, vnto their hidden deceits added a manifest impudency, and boldly thereupon began to say: How Christ had promised his faythfull Disciples, that neyther the poysonous, nor fatall drinkes, should seeme to hurt them. Whence if he would but tast thereof, he should soone doubtlesse confesse that saying of the Ghospell to be false. At which wordes <hi>S.

To which condition they yielding assent, his word was performed, as well without the hurt of his person, as with the glorious purchase of those mindes seduced.</p>
               <p>These, and many other thinges, which for breuity we let passe
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:12171:259"/>
were wrought by the Blessed <hi>Anthony</hi> in the name of Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all course &amp; compasse of humane power: which being mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with a singular innocency of manners, and with a solid, liuely and enflamed eloquence, may not seeme strange they should fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifye so much, not only in the harts of the meaner and poorer sort (which ordinarily is wont, very willingly to accept the word of God, &amp; without difficulty to rayse the affect from visible things) but euen also in the minds of the rich and potent; who so rarely imbrace the seed of the Ghospell, and be so hardly weaned from false delights, and designes, to aspire with paynes, mortifications, and almes to the future felicity. And yet many of this condition rendred themselues to the battayls of this great Captayne, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted wholy to his discretion and gouernement (as we sayd) both their goods and liues.</p>
               <p>Among which, a principall Baron of <hi>Padua,</hi> being called <hi>Tisone Campo San Pietro,</hi> may not seeme to be reckoned in the last place. This man after he had serued long in the warres, wherein he had beene a chiefe Commander, retyring himselfe to his house, and laying his armes aside, at the intreaty of the Blessed <hi>Antony,</hi> with the good example of the whole Citty, gaue himselfe to spirit; and conceauing feruour and zeale to help his subiects, obtayned of the Blessed Father to vouchsafe to come into the Land of <hi>Campo S.

Which S. <hi>Antony</hi> refused not, especially for that there was in that place a little Conuent of Minours, that was maintayned by the almes of <hi>Tisone</hi> himselfe. True it is, that <hi>S. Antony</hi> being arriued there, to remaine more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred, would not abide continually, neither among the Fryars, nor lesse in the Pallace of his Host, but vnder a Nut-tree of an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurable greatnes, from whose truncke grew forth six great branches in manner of a crowne, causing three litle Cells to be set vp, one for himselfe, and the other for two Fryars and companions of his (in which worke <hi>Tisone</hi> himselfe with singular piety did la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with his owne hands) whence <hi>S. Antony</hi> was wont after his exercises of prayer and contemplation, to preach vnto the people; which assembled to that heauenly food, from the neighbour coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes thereabout; but yet descending at the howers of refection and rest, he remayned in the Conuent.</p>

               <p>VVIth such manner of strictnes of life accompanyed (as we haue sayd) with an extraordinary weake complexion, and many labours, and trauayls withall, came the seruant of Christ to be so feeble, as being surprized in <hi>Campo San Pietro</hi> with a gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous infirmity, he soone, and directly told it likewise to one about him, that he was now arriued to the terme of his short dayes, and hoped ere long to go, &amp; enioy those places without terme or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of tyme. And withall not to be troublesome in his cure, either to that small Oratory of Minors, or the lay Families there, though he were with the most affectuous prayers that might be, coniured by all to abide with them, yet causing himselfe to be layd in a Countrey cart, he went to <hi>Padua.</hi> And considering that in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery of <hi>Sancta Maria Maior,</hi> within the wals, he should too much be molested with visits, he diuerted to another place, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Arcella,</hi> of <hi>Franciscans</hi> indeed, but yet somwhat forth of the Citty.</p>
               <p>Heere now being oppressed with the malady, with all deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he receiued the holsome Sacraments, and with hands ioyned together, and lifted vp, not without extraordinary feeling he recited the seauen Penitentiall psalmes, and a deuout hymne to the most Blessed Virgin, whose protection with particuler ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice he had allwayes sought to rely vpon.

being demaunded what he looked vpon?

               <p>In the meane while the Fryars of <hi>Arcella,</hi> fearing some tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous concourse would be at the body, endeuoured to keep the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of the seruant of Christ very secret, but in vayne.

               <p>But aboue all, Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the IX. himselfe, who before in <hi>Rome</hi> had with so choyce an Elogy commended the doctrine of the seruant of God, concurred to the exalting of his glorious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. So as scarcely had a moneth passed ouer from the death, or to say better, from the natiuity of S. <hi>Antony,</hi> but causing a most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act inquisition to be made of his life, and miracles, with the high approbation of all the Cardinalls, and Prelats of the holy Church, he canonized him solemnly, and enrolled him among those spirits, who arriued in the eternall country, doe securely enioy the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificall vision of God, there making intercession for others, who being on the way, are yet doubtfull continually of their progresse and tearme. Through which iudgment and approbation of the Sea Apostolike, was enflamed in all Christendome, a new desire to accumulate honours vpon the sacred depositum, &amp; a liuely sayth in presenting supplications to that glorious soule: the <hi>Paduans</hi> yet in

The birth not only of the Saint, but also his Religion was foretould by a venerable Hermit, who liued in those Countreyes, called <hi>Bonus;</hi> who visiting <hi>Theodora</hi> neere her childbirth, saluted her, saying: <hi>Be ioyfull Lady, for you shall shortly haue a sonne, who for his singular qualities shall be renowned through the world, and shall take the habit you see heere depainted:</hi> It was euen the habit of S. <hi>Dominicke,</hi> the which, at the foot of the Mother of God, in a little image, he wore for deuotion hanging about his necke. <hi>Theodora</hi> answered: <hi>Gods will be done.</hi> After which, the child being borne into the world, and called in sacred Baptisme by the name of <hi>Thomas,</hi> soone gaue very
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:12171:263"/>
manifest signes of the learning and sanctity which in tyme were to shine in him. Because on a day while the Nurse was making him a bath, he snatching vp of his owne accord a peece of paper from the ground, held it fast in the hand, and the Nurse going about to take it away, he began to cry, and to be so troubled at it, as for a last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy she was feigne to wash him, with the same in his hand.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the mother being aduertised, to cleere and satisfy her selfe the better of the matter, opened his hand by force, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the paper from him, they found there written the salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Archangell <hi>Gabriel</hi> to the Virgin Mary, and that with so much more wonder of theirs, and of all the standers by, as they could lesse coniecture, how such a writing could come into his handes. The little Child in the meane tyme, with signes neuer cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to reach after it, and to cry and sob for the same, vntill to quiet him they were forced to yield it him againe: and he not to haue it taken away any more, putting it in his mouth, on a sudden swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it vp. This same, as we say, was held of the wise, and of men of good vnderstanding, for a great and certaine presage of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall knowledge, and of the rare vertues, which in progresse of tyme were to ripen in <hi>Thomas:</hi> it being not likely that a child in the swath-bands, without diuine operation could be so enamoured with the words, which were the beginning and fountayne of all the mysteryes of the new law, and of Christian piety.</p>
               <p>Nor this signe only of future fruites, was seen in that noble bud, but as often as a booke, or ought els but like to a booke, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to his sight, with childish endeauour he would reach after it, and take it in his hand, turning it vp and downe, and looking on it without end; so as to comforte him, when need was, and to still him and dry his teares, there was no more efficacious way, then to put a paper or booke into his hands, to play withall. A midst such hopes, being now arriued to fiue yeares old, that he might be the better conserued in purity and vertuous manners, he was according to the laudable customes of those tymes giuen to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Monks of <hi>Monte Cassino,</hi> to be trayned vp: vnder whose care were likewise many children of Lords and Princes besides. Not had the Maister any difficulty at all, to direct this happy plant vnto immortall and diuine things; since the child of his owne accord, shewing himselfe to be aliened from base thoughts, and from all curiosity whatsoeuer, did euen tyre him with high and profound

questions, whereof one was, to demaund often, what God was? Besides that, keeping himselfe from company of the lesse modest &amp; deuout, he would voluntarily recollect himselfe, with the wiser &amp; more prudent sort, and more addicted to spirit: yea it is affirmed for certaine, that euen at that tyme, he would spend two houres of the day, in sundry deuotions, and yet not fayle to be at schoole, or to do whatsoeuer the Maister appointed him besides.

Great was the authority of the Abbot with all men, nor lesse ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious were the reasons alleadged by him. <hi>Thomas</hi> his age (which as yet not passed ten yeares) afforded a large field for great desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. The neighbour Citty of <hi>Naples,</hi> being the auncient and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious receptable (as <hi>Strabo</hi> testifyes) of sublimer witts, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>All these occasions, through diuine disposition concurred to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to mantayne <hi>Thomas</hi> so studious of speculation and learning: so as being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueighed from the Country to the Metropolis, &amp; from gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer to the grauer studyes, vnder famous Doctours, he studyed the Mathematikes, Logike, and Philosopy, with such profit as in short tyme, his name began to resound through the whole Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersity, extolling with the lustre of his Bloud, and splendour of his parents, the singular qualityes and rare ornaments of his person. At which glory afforded him, was yet the wise and chast youth not puffed vp a whit, but rather endeuoured he with all force, to stand firme in the knowledge and meane esteeme of himselfe, and amidst what varieties so euer of human accidents, to hold his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion fixed and centered in God only: and by how much more knowledge he got of the Creatour by the meanes of creatures, and from Tyme learned Eternity, &amp; from transitory things the stable

and eternall, so much greater desire was enkindled in him, to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quester himselfe from the vulgar, and with a generous contempt of the world, of purpose to attend to the contemplation of the first cause, &amp; to cultiuate wholy that part of himselfe, which he knew to be more worthy, and more like vnto God. Such was the end &amp; scope of the good youth, but in the election of the meane, he could not yet resolue, but remayned in the same perplexity, vntill a cleare day was added to the vncertaine light of the passed inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, through the occasions we shall presently declare.</p>

               <p>THe sacred Order of the Fryars Preachers, now flourished in those dayes, that was founded by the glorious Father S. <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicke,</hi> and there were, euen at that tyme also, as euer after haue been, many men of excellent learning and singular vertue amongst them. Now S. <hi>Thomas</hi> hauing friendship with one of these, namely with <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>S. Iulian,</hi> began ingenuously to conferre with him of his stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes and labours. Whereupon being often present at his disputes, &amp; discourses, and of others of the same Family, he came by little and little to affectionate himselfe to their Institu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e, while it seemed to him, he could no wayes better imploy the talents he had from God, then in the company of men wholy giuen to the extirpation of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies, and defence, and exaltation of the Catholike Fayth. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happs the better to examine his spirit, or not to trust to much too himselfe, he differred (as the vse is) his resolution yet longer. When <hi>Iohn</hi> easily perceiuing what the noble youth reuolued in mind, he determined to spurre him on, &amp; with good opportunity sayd to him one day: It seemes to me <hi>Thomas,</hi> when I cast myne eyes vpon thee, and thy labours, and trauayles, thou aspirest to no vayne, or transitory rewards: but if thou wilt attayne thy purpose, Know assuredly my Sonne, that perfect wisdome and true felicity, is not got amidst the distractions, intrications, &amp; labyrinths of the world. The recollection of the soule, and the repose and solitude, which are found in Religious, is the next disposition to apprehend the truth with, and to receiue continually new rayes and influences from heauen. This way, as you well know, haue the greatest lights of Christendome held; who sequestring themselues from busynesses
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:12171:264"/>
and po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ngs, then the bawling of so many Curres. Wherefore do thou also with like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples not fayle to disentangle thy selfe. This habit heere now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects thee a good while, and if thou resoluest but to accept the same, my mind giues me, nor am I a whit deceiued, that by thy meanes our Lord will worke some notable exployt.</p>
               <p>Such was the first assault and battery which <hi>Iohn</hi> gaue him, and not in vayne. Since that finding now at first the walls to be shaken with this discourse, he proceeded on to leuell them with the earth, and to take all obstacles quite away: and S. <hi>Thomas</hi> easily conuinced, gaue vp the hold, saying: Father, I would not haue you thinke me to be so cold, and so poore a louer of the chiefest good, as that the peoples talke, or any other respect whatsoeuer, should put me off, from following it with all my forces. Your exhortation, hath not found me alienated a whit, from such manner of designes, since now already I haue thought with my selfe long since, to retire me. And now only to resolue of the place, I had need of some louing directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and prudent counsayle. To which office of charity, since it hath pleased our Lord to make vse of your person, assure your selfe I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue your words, as come from the Holy Ghost. Whence I pray, let there be no delay made: Doe you deale with the Superiours, for I will not depart hence, til the busynes be concluded. <hi>Iohn</hi> could haue wished for no better newes. Soone shall you be satisfyed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed he then; and going in hast to the Priour, without any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, but rather with a great deale of ioy of the whole Conuent, he brought the busynes begun, to a very good passe; and <hi>Thomas</hi> was put into the habit, with the due ceremonyes, being then of seauenteene yeares of age.</p>
               <p>Now seeing himselfe, to be thus shut vp in the Monastery, &amp; esteeming himselfe to be sufficiently fenced against the clamours of his freinds, and Citty: considering the state he had entered into, he began to frame his life, according to the obligement of his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; holding it a great scorne if after the leauing of such hopes in the world, he should not so carry himselfe in Religion, as euery one should not rest satisfyed of the course he had vndertaken. Then partly through the internall motiues, which he felt in his breast, partly the exteriour examples &amp; aduices of the Fathers with whom he liued, he went on more encouraged euery day, not to forflow
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:12171:265"/>
any thing, that might any wayes promote him to the top of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which he had proposed to himselfe. And howbeyt in ech vertue through diuine grace, and with the continual vse of prayer, he laboured to become excellent, yet with particuler application he endeuoured to goe forward in holy humility, as well for ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledging it to be the Mother of all good, as also in seeing an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary necessity imposed vpon him, to shew forth himselfe more meeke and humble to all, by how much the ornaments and habilityes he had receiued from God, were more apt to moue enuy, and to make him more haughty and proud. And forasmuch as he well knew, there was no more direct, and speedy way for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid vertue, then the perpetuall subiection and mortification of the proper will &amp; iudgment, he gaue himselfe to obserue obedience aboue all things: and euen from the first beginning so ordered he, &amp; composed the mind, as that neither in words nor deeds, would he once digresse from the Superiours dictamens, nor from the orders, and rules of his Religion: and therefore he attended to read them, as he might euery moment without difficulty be putting them in practise. Besides which, knowing how important sobriety and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence were to restrayne passions, and to conserue the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding cleere, and quick-sighted, he determined to giue no place to superfluous nourishment &amp; sleep; whence, eyther the flesh might kick through too much pampering, or the mind be ouercast with fumes and vapours. Finally, he euer abhorred all idlenes, not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering any houre vnfruitfully to passe away, and leauing withall, as litle place as might be to the temptations, and subtilityes of the ancient Enemy.</p>

               <p>Neuerthelesse, the Dominican Fathers, not to expose so new and worthy a subiect to the hazard of his vocation, vnderstanding of the Countesse comming, made hast to send him to <hi>Rome;</hi> from thence to passe vnto <hi>Paris.</hi> When <hi>Theodora</hi> had notice thereof, it cannot easily be expressed what anger and disdayne she conceiued for it, and laying all other thoughts aside, she posted to <hi>Rome;</hi> and not finding her deere pledge there neyther, she presently wrytes to her sonnes in the Campe, to send forth assoone as may be, to way-lay the Roman passage, and apprehending their Brother on his way to <hi>France</hi> in a Fryars habit, by any meanes to send him to her. This message to those Souldyers (who as yet had heard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the newes of S. <hi>Thomas)</hi> was both sudden, and vngratefull to them.

               <p>This boldnes of <hi>Theodora,</hi> and of her elder Sonnes, with reason displeased the Pope, when he heard the same from the Fathers of S. <hi>Dominicke,</hi> and would surely haue proceeded against them with
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:12171:266"/>
censures &amp; excommunications, if the sayd Religious for auoyding scandall, and to shew themselues rather to be friends of peace, had not pacifyed the matter, in leauing all to the diuine iustice. But <hi>Theodora</hi> yet not contented with what she had done, being retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to her countrey, beginns afresh to lay a cruell assault against S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> saying among other thinges, that which followes: When thy Father of happy memory, and I thy vnfortunate Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther first sent thee to <hi>Monte Cassino,</hi> and afterwardes to study at <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> we had verily thought, that the conuersation of such, euen so held in esteeme for sanctity and learning, as the Fathers of <hi>S. Benet</hi> were, and the others of <hi>S. Dominicke,</hi> would haue bred and nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in thee nothing but piety and reuerence due to a Mother, at least humanity and discretion, to be shewed of right to euery one: but now with these deportements of thyne, thou makest me doubt that these new Orders insteed of meeknes and ciuility do but teach men to put on the habit of fiercenes &amp; cruelty: yet when I am pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at their preachinges, I do heare them commend both with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and with authority of sacred Scriptures, the obseruance, and honour due vnto Father and Mother, and the care which euery one ought to haue of their domestiques. If these moderne Deuines, to purchase in publique an opinion of sanctity, and in secret to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to their priuate interests, do but celebrate Mercy in the Pulpit, and in their Cell approue inhumane, rigours, and of harsh manners, and if so it be with them; then surely it is to be thought a goodly sanctity to lye so in the Pulpit, to deceaue the Auditours, &amp; with trim and colourable speaches of piety to inueagle and entice the vnwary youth, to make them afterwardes in Cloysters, to become very sauage and brutish, arming them, and setting them on against their owne Mothers, sometymes more iust and timourous of God, then euen the Preachers themselues.</p>
               <p>And likewise if it be true, as I haue alwayes vnderstood, that to haue respect to Parents, both by diuine Law and naturall instinct, be straightly imposed on euery man; what excuse canst thou seeme to alleadge, my Sonne, for not casting thyne eyes hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, on so great calamityes, as now haue partly happened to me, and partly also, are likely to arriue anew, and euen hang ouer my head? Tell me? Where is thy Father, who hath left me a Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, surcharged so with yeares, amidst so grieuous stormes &amp; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities? Where are thy Brothers, who being accused for being
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:12171:266"/>
too fauourable, and followers of the Pope, are violently detayned by <hi>Cesar?</hi> Yet so great losse, and miseries might in some manner be suffered by me, if there were but any hope yet left vs of better. But these differences which raigne so betweene the Emperour and the Pope, and the sinister conceit, wherein we are with the most po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and stronger part; alas, how I feare it will redound at last, to an vtter ruine of our house, and our whole Citty. One comfort only remayned vnto me, in thy person, while thy wisedome and rare partes seemed to promise me, they would shortly rayse thee to so high an estate and dignity, as thou only mighst suffice to remedy all these losses and perills. But most vnhappy we, that euen we applyed thee to study and deuotion, while now thou art become an idle spectatour only of the calamityes, and troubles of thy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consolate Mother, Brothers, Parents and Friends, and lastly of the flames and ashes of all the afflicted countrey. To which I see well thou art likely to giue vs some goodly succour surely, with those horrid garments I see vpon thee, and with thy flying so, into the dens of <hi>France,</hi> there to reioyce thee, and to laugh at our death and Exequies.</p>

If so many ruines as you say Madame, are like to befall our house, neyther you nor I can tell which way to remedy them, since for the future it rests in the hands, and will of God. Nor to me appeares, we are to expect so much euill fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the diuine Goodnes: &amp; if in very deed our sinnes, and those of our Country seeme to merit the same, what better meane can I take, to pacify the Heauenly wrath, then to dispoyle me of my selfe, and to offer me vp as a full and perfect Holocaust to his Eternall Maiesty? If I should haue remayned with you in the world, or now returne to it a new, what should I doe but increase with my presence your misfortunes, laments, &amp; woes?

               <p>But where are the flames? where the fires you exaggerate so much? For my part I do see none present, nor do I know whence they are like to come. And if indeed (as I sayd) they were to be feared so, for our owne sinnes; it rests not in my power but in Gods only, to exempt vs from them. And when you would rely on hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man succours, haue you not other Sonnes, as more auncient in yeares, so of much more prudence and worth then I?

Nor would I haue you say heere, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, that I am quite depriued of affection and of common sense, and that from the Seruants of God I haue learned to be in human &amp; sauage: these are but fables meerly.

But in summe, you deceiue your selfe Madame, if you thinke with your artificiousnes to draw a soule into basenes and mire, that hauing through the grace of God already tasted some fruite of the spirit and true vertues, hath now at last in scorne and loathing what pleasures soeuer the sense and flesh can promise.

Then the disciple of Christ, taking compassion of their youthfull errour, &amp; praying most earnestly for those soules, endeuoured to peece vp agayne the torne habit, the best he could with his owne hands, and thanking God for the victory obtayned, now returned agayne to his wonted occupations; when besides all expectation, he was surprized with a new assault, more fierce then euer; a wanton woman, set on by the Brothers, and brought in of purpose to tempt him: But he, as one that knew well the daunger of such manner of battayles, snatching suddenly a brand out of the fire, chased away that monster from his chamber, and shutting fast the doore, at the same instant drew a Crosse on the wal with the same stick, before which hauing prostrated himselfe, most
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:12171:269"/>
humbly besought he our Lord, that if by chance that hellish fight had left in his imagination any manner of blot whatsoeuer, he would vouchsafe of his infinite mercy to take it away quite, and to graunt him besides so much help and fauour, as he might be able very perfectly to preserue his chastity to his death, which in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion he had deuoutly promised.</p>
               <p>The diuine eares were not deafe, vnto so iust &amp; seruent prayers. The Champion of Christ thereupon being growne very weary, fell into a short sleepe: when two Angells from heauen appeared to him, telling him his prayers were heard, &amp; for a testimony the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof, they guirded this loynes with a belt, so strongly, as that through payne therof crying out aloud, it made his keepers to enter, into him, to whom notwithstanding he would not discouer what had happened, as neyther reuealed he it afterwards to any others, vntill the article of his death, when it seemed to him, he was then obliged in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science not to bury so cleere an act of the diuine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in perpetuall obliuion. But after that accident, if some great necessity for the glory of God or behoof of the neighbours required it not, he kept himselfe wholy from all couersation with women, as from basiliskes, and serpents.</p>
               <p>For two whole yeares he had now been shut vp in that prison; at the end whereof <hi>Theodora,</hi> being now growne weary, &amp; partly also being gauled with touches of her conscience, calling for some of the Fathers Preachers vnto her, she secretly gaue order to them to come at a certaine houre of the night, vnto the foot of the wall against the chamber of S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and that he descending by a cord from the window, or a false ladder, they might carry him away in the name of God. The occasion of this secrecy was, as well the feare of offending her other Sonnes, if without their consentes he had been openly let goe, as the respect of her owne reputation, which seemed to be in danger, if after so many contentions, and so much adoe, her sage practizes should manifestly be vanquished at last, by the constancy and reasons of a youth only.

               <p>BY occasion of such a Doctour, S. <hi>Thomas</hi> gaue himselfe to heape vp new treasures of wisedome, and to attend the better to so noble a purchase. He imposed on himselfe in the meane tyme, a Pithagorean silence, in so much as he was come into contempt for the same with the rest of his fellowes in the schoole, &amp; was brought into such a conceipt amongst them of a slow and grosse capacity, as by a surname they called him the <hi>dumbe Oxe.</hi> But the diuine Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence suffered not so rare a light of wit, should be hidden long.

There was explicated at that tyme in Schooles the booke of S. <hi>Denys Areopagita, de Diuinis nominibus,</hi> a very high matter, and full of deep mysteryes.

               <p>This did <hi>S. Thomas</hi> refuse at first, of his innated modesty.

himselfe farre from any arrogancy at all: whence he came euery day to be so much the more admirable to all, and was by vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall consent held no lesse then a Saint.

               <p>S. <hi>Thomas</hi> vnderstanding thereof, and esteeming himselfe very farre vnworthy of that name, began afresh to find excuses, and to alleadge particulerly his age, which as yet had not finished the thirtith yeare, yet for all that he was fayne to obey. And in such extremity of his, recurring (according to custome) to the armes of prayer, he begins to craue the succour of the Almighty God; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till such tyme as being once perplexed, among other things, about the Theme he should take in that publike act, a venerable old man appeared to him in sleep, and sayd to him: What aylest thou <hi>Thomas,</hi> that thou weepest, and so afflictest thy selfe in this manner? He answered, they enforce me to take the name &amp; office of Maister vpon me, wherto I know my selfe, to be insufficient: and being among other things at the beginning to make a discourse, I know not what Theme to take. Then, replyed the old man: Be of good cheer my Sonne: It is the will of God that thou accept the degree. For Theme thou shalt take that verse of the Psalme, <hi>Rigans montes de superioribus suis, &amp; de fructu operum tuorum satiabitur terra.</hi> That sayd, the old man vanished, and <hi>S.

In his manner of interpreting he had an easy, cleere, and distinct methode. He fled new opinions, and the vnusualf manner of phrases and words. In disputes, he kept himselfe from moderate contentions, and extranagant acts or clamors, maturely yeilding to others obstinacyes or pertinacityes, and choosing rather for the glory of God, and edification of the Neighbour, to appeare

Wheresoeuer he read, but especially in <hi>Paris,</hi> and in <hi>Rome,</hi> he had alwayer his Schoole very flourishing, both for number and quality of hearers, Doctours, Bishops, Cardinals: and it is a notable thing, that with all the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and authority he had gotten, yet neuer slacked he his dilgence, being otherwise one of so great a naturall wit, as he had few his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualls, and of so happy a memory withal, that in a manner, as often as he had but once seene any thing, he would faythfully retayne it for euer; and of such vigour of mind, as that which is recounted of some Ancients for so admirable a thing, he would yet doe more in dictating, in diuers matters, vnto three or foure Scribes at once, &amp; yet that rich floud of wisedome would neuer be diminished.</p>

               <p>IT would be too long, and a superfluous thing to make heere a Catalogue of his workes so many, and of so great note, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he confirmed the Catholike fayth, &amp; rooted out, and opprest many heresies, partly increased already, and partly new growne vp: ech state and quality of persons he would instruct with holsom aduises and precepts, and finally illustrated the sacred Thology, and brought it againe to its ancient dignity, reducing and submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all other sciences to its Empire, which through the fault of some impious Sophisters seemed heeretofore to dissent and rebell, from it. But as he would touch the point in euery matter, so he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to haue a speciall grace, in treating of the most excellent Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Altar, and not only in Prose, but in Latin time also, according to the customes of those tymes; in so much as for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent doctrine and piety contayned therin, the Catholike Church euen to this day, singes no other Office, or Masse on the day of the great solemnity of <hi>Corpus Christi,</hi> then that which he composed, at the instance of Pope <hi>Vrban</hi> the IV.</p>

in apprehension, and patience in speculation. Forasmuch as he not only acutely penetrated and distinguished at once, but would also diue into the deeper inuestigations, as that very often he would come to loose his senses. When on a tyme, being in such an abstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, a cole of fire, lighting on his leg, and agayne the flame of the candell, which studying he held in his hand, euen touching his flesh, a prety while, he stirred not awhit, nor was moued any more thereat then a meere stone.</p>
               <p>That same likewise was memorable, which happened to him, at a Feast with <hi>S. Lewys</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> at such tyme as he wrot that noble Summe against the Gentils: in which matter he was then so absorpt, as that amidst the Royall dishes of the King, forgetting himselfe and the standers by, he suddenly cryed out: <hi>The Manichies are conuinced;</hi> and seeming to him, that he was in his Cell, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to <hi>Fryar Reginald</hi> his companion, to dictate to him as he was wont. But after awaked by the Dominican Priour who sate by him and crauing pardon with some confusion, he was comforted and excused by the wise King, at whose beck one was suddenly called that might faythfully note those new conceipts. Nor les<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ore things and of more excellent misteryes in that space only, then euer he had in all the labours, &amp; watches he had endured till that tyme.</p>
               <p>And surely is it not to be past ouer in silence, that he being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with so great guifts by nature, and besides that, so great a friend to labour, yet to make new profit euery day in sciences, he depended so much on God, as that before his entring vnto study, he would allwayes recommend himselfe very ardently to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall wisedome, as if he had expected all successe from heauen only, and by no other wayes. An industry truly, very worthy to be imitated of ech Student: Because that such as without hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to God more then so, do confide &amp; in their proper guifts, by how much they goe forward, and proceed in learning, so much are they puffed vp in their soules; in such wise, as being thence blinded whence they might haue had light, they stumble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and draw others withall into their miserable errours and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestiferous

opinions. But the Angelicall Doctour (as I sayd) did quite the contrary, nor was he deceiued awhit of his hope: since many conclusions, being otherwise doubtfull and obscure, by this only way he drew forth from the deep abysse (as they say) of truth, as we shall cleerely make appeare by the example following.</p>
               <p>The Saint explicated the oracles of <hi>Esay,</hi> and being come vnto a passage, whence by human help he could no wayes acquit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; according to his vse he recurred to diuine, and gaue himselfe to fast and pray for that intention, so many dayes (taking besides <hi>S. Peter</hi> and <hi>S. Paul</hi> for intercessours) as that those glorious Apostles at last one night appeared to him in his Cell, and there sweetly confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with him, a prety while, put light into him, and so quit him of al perplexity. In the meane tyme, <hi>Fryar Reginald</hi> was in the ante-cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber as he was wont, and though he heard the voyces, yet nothing vnderstood what they sayd. The vision then being vanished; S. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> called him in to write, and dictated the whole declaration to him, so largely, and without stop, as if he had been taking it forth of another booke in order. The dictates being ended; <hi>Reginald,</hi> who had heard confusedly the murmure aforesaid, did most ardently thirst, to haue a distinct notice thereof, and therefore lying prostrate on the earth, besought him not to hide or conceale it from him, and that with so much affect, and with so great instance withall, as the seruant of God (vnder the condition and seale as before) ingenuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discouered it to him.</p>
               <p>Besides that, this so frequent prayer anailed him much, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne his spirit alwayes very cheerefull and fresh, which of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with much speculation is wont to be arid and dry. Howbeit the holy man togeather with the assiduity of prayer, would vse also other potent and generous remedyes. Whereof the principall was, to approach to the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine of all graces, the sacred Eucharist; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he was so deuout, that besides his saying euery day Masse, he would afterwards humbly serue another. And as in preparing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to that banket of the Angells, he would add particuler study and attention; so after in rendring of thankes, he would suddenly be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

with so much fayth, as that one day touching <hi>Fryar Reginald</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with being dangerously sicke, he recouered him straight.

               <p>By which meanes, in so great an abundance of heauenly guifts, how he kept himselfe humble, and magnanimous both, through his whole life (being qualities not so disioyned from themselues, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>SAint Thamas</hi> now ripe for glory and age, by this tyme passed to the Cloysters of <hi>Bologna,</hi> addicting himselfe to most deep consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations: when a certaine Fryar, new come from forren parts, &amp; hauing leaue of the Priour, to goe forth into the Citty for some bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse with the first Companion he could meete with, by chaunce lighted on <hi>S. Thomas,</hi> not knowing him by sight, and willed him in behalfe of the Superiour, to goe a long with him: at which voyce, the Imitatour of Christ, as sent from an Oracle, not only obeyed without delay, but also being after not able to go so fast as the other, through a lame legge which he had, with incredible patience he suffered some rebukes for the same; vntill such tyme as being adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by Seculars of the person whome he intreated so ill, being wholy confounded thereat, and excusing himselfe of his ignorance, very humbly craued pardon of him for it. Whereupon <hi>S. Thomas</hi> being demaunded of the same Gentlemen, wherefore he had so aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed himselfe, he made answere with a graue countenance: <hi>Religion</hi> (forsooth) <hi>consists in Obedience, and obedience for one man to submit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to another for God, since God himselfe for our sake would subiect himselfe to Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From another thing, we may likewise gather, the loue which the Saint had of his owne proper subiection; Which is, that he not only, in his owne Order, abstayned alwayes from Prelacy and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, but euen likewise abroad, being called by Pope <hi>Clement</hi>
                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:12171:272"/>
the IV. to the Archbishopricke of <hi>Naples,</hi> he so refused the same, as he supplicated withall, and as much as he durst tooke hold of the chiefe Bishop, beseeching him not to offer him any dignityes. What shall we say then of the regard and caution he had, not to attribute any good to himselfe? In so much as to the honour of Christ, and for the help of soules, vpon good occasion he confessed sincerely, being then of good yeares, amidst so much celebrity and humane prayses, so many Magistrall Chayres, so many Preachinges, lessons, disputes and so many publique Acts maintayned, and so great variety of compositions and labours, he had neuer felt in his soule the least gust, or complacence of Vaine-glory.</p>
               <p>From this so chast a loue and feare of God, and from this care which the Seruant of Christ had of himself, sprung the fruit which he wrought with others; and from his conuersation in Heauen, followed his dealing securely with men. In his preachinges (as we haue sayd also of his Lessons) he attended more vnto profit, then pompe; he attempered himselfe to the reach of the people, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all, conformed his life with his wordes. Whence he came to be heard with so great concourse, veneration, and silence, as he had beene an Angell descended from Paradise. And sometymes our Lord God would concurre with euident miracles, as it happened once on an Easter day in the Citty of <hi>Rome</hi> at S. <hi>Peters,</hi> where he descending from the Pulpit, a certaine woman, now troubled and afflicted a long tyme with an incurable fluxe of bloud, approached vnto him in a presse of people, and touching him by the hemme of his Cloake with much fayth, she was immediatly made sound, and as strong as euer.</p>
               <p>His priuate discourses also were of marueilous efficaay, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he studyed alwayes to insert vpon good occasions, some thing of edification, and if perhaps in any graue matter, it were needfull to perswade, or to examine out the truth of any thing with reasons, there was hardly found any that were able to make resistance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, as may easily appeare by the action following. Being once present at the feast of the Natiuity, for certaine occurrences, with the Cardinall <hi>Riccardo,</hi> at <hi>Molara,</hi> a place somewhat neare to <hi>Rome,</hi> there met also by good happe two <hi>Iewes,</hi> by how much richer in substance and more learned in the ancient Law, so much the more were they addicted to flesh, and more obstinate in their perfidiousnes. Hauing taken in hand then to treat with those two
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:12171:273"/>
soules at the instance of the Cardinall, after an encounter had, with a long dispute, he conuinced them in such sort, that hauing both by accord taken the space of a night to thinke vpon it (while he in the meane tyme was praying for them) at last they yielded, and the infant Iesus now corporally borne in a vile manner, was spiritually borne anew in their hartes. So as repenting themselues of their life past, and comming forth of darknes into a cleare light, they were both baptized with the common ioy and gladnes of all.</p>
               <p>This singular Man had a notable zeale of the saluation of all; but yet notwithstanding his familiar freindshipps were restrayned to few. One of his deerest and beloued was, the Seraphicall S. <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauenture;</hi> &amp; to this purpose it is recounted, that going once to visit him, at such tyme as the Saint was writing the life of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> finding him in an extasy, and with the body eleuated in the ayre; he stopt awhile, and turning to his companion sayd: <hi>Let vs suffer one Saint to work for another.</hi> One quality also was seen in him, very proper for perfect men, that he being so rigid &amp; seuere to himselfe, was yet exceeding benigne and mercifull to those, that synned out of human frailty, in taking compassion vpon their defects, yea wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping also alike for them, as they were his owne. And besides had a pious and officious memory of the faythfull departed, so as his <hi>Sister,</hi> once being dead appeared to him in <hi>Paris,</hi> crauing succour at his hands to be deliuered from Purgatory. And he as well by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe as others, afforded such helps, and suffrages togeather, as a litle after he being in <hi>Rome,</hi> she returned to him, to let him vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that now she was quit of her paynes, &amp; for euer blessed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the face of God. Vpon this occasion, S. <hi>Thomas</hi> required of her some newes likewise of his of two Brothers, both deceased: &amp; she answeared, that <hi>Landulph</hi> continued yet in Purgatory, but <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold</hi> reioyced now in heauen; and thou soone shalt be also in our company, but with a great deale more glory, for thy labours endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the seruice of the holy Church.</p>

three seuerall holy Popes, <hi>Clement</hi> the IV. <hi>Vrban</hi> the IV. &amp; <hi>Gregory</hi> the X. The first whereof, as hath been sayd, endeuoured in vayne to make him Archbishop of <hi>Naples:</hi> the second helped himselfe much by him in writing things of great importance, and especially in confuting the errours of the Greeks: the third hauing intimated a Councell at <hi>Lyons</hi> in <hi>France</hi> for weighty necessityes of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church, among the cheife, called for S. <hi>Thomas</hi> thither; and heere with, not thinking thereof, he hastened his end, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his labours. Because being then at <hi>Naples,</hi> not wel disposed for health, to obey the Pope, he put himselfe on the iourney with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay: and being arriued at S. <hi>Seuerine</hi> a Castle of his Sisters, there fell sick. From thence, being yet not well recouered, sustay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the weakenes of his body with the forces of the mind, against the will of his deerest freinds, he went forwards, vntill such tyme as he fell into a relapse at <hi>Fossa noua,</hi> a place of the <hi>Cistercians</hi> in the Diocesse of <hi>Piperno,</hi> in so much as he felt (and so told Fryar <hi>Reginald</hi> in secret) that now approached his last day.</p>
               <p>Heere he was receaued by the Abbot, and the other Monkes with the greatest Charity that might be, who the more they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in curing and seruing him, in carrying among other things some fuell from the wood, on their owne shoulders, being then the tyme of winter, so much more was the sicke man sorry and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, to haue them suffer so much for his sake, saying with great feeling: <hi>And who am I, that the seruants of Christ, should trauaile so much for me?</hi> Nor would he likewise in that space be found to be idle, because at the instance of some of them, who desired some yssue of his noble wit, he briefely expounded the Canticles of <hi>Salomon,</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing his passage out of this life, and aspiring vnto the Eternall Canticles. And for that now his forces began to fayle him, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutly required the most holy Sacrament of the Eucharist, which being brought by the Abbot, withall the Conuent, though now reduced to extremes, yet he leaped from his bed, and cast him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe on the ground with many teares.</p>
               <p>Being afterwards demaunded (according to custome) if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued indeed the true Sonne of God, for our saluation borne of the Virgin, dead on the Crosse, and then risen agayne, to be contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the sacred Host, with a cleere and confident voyce he sayd: <hi>I wholy beleiue it, or rather more then certainely I know, this to be IESVS CHRIST true God, and true man, the Sonne of the eternall Father, and of
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:12171:274"/>
the Virgin Mother. And as I beleiue it with a pure hart, so doe I also with sincere mouth confesse the same.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That sayd, very reuerently he receiued the Viatique, and the day following he craued the extreme Vnction, remayning all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in his perfect iudgment, so as himselfe did answere very punctually to euery thing: and finally with hands vnited &amp; lifted vp to heauen-wards, recommending his spirit to the Creatour, he happily departed, in the morning on the seauenth day of March, in the yeare of our Lord 1274. which was of his vocation the 32. &amp; the 50. of his life. At this his passage, besides the <hi>Cistertians,</hi> were present many Dominicans and Franciscans, being come at that tyme to visit him from sundry Monasteryes. The Bishop of <hi>Terra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cina,</hi> likewise was there present. But the Nephew of the Saint, running thither at the report of his danger, now finding him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted this life, and being not able to enter into the Monastery, obteyned with much prayers, the sacred corps might be exposed at the gate that he might behold the same. Heere arose a great and vniuersall playnt for the losse of such a personage. Yea the writers doe affirme for certaine, that the beast it selfe which he was wont to ride on, breaking the halter by force wherewith he was tyed, ran thither at the same tyme also, to the Beere or hearse, and there in the presence of all, falling to the earth, fell suddenly dead. Whereat the standers by being astonished did glorify God, and carrying the body into the Church of S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> with such and so great veneration they buryed it, as cannot easely be xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, and that before the high aultar. He was of complexion very corpulent, though he were so strict an obseruer of fasts and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence. He was of a very delicate flesh, sensitiue, and conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for the most excellent temperature of his organs; of stature straight and tall; of the colour of wheat; of eyes most modest; for strength robustuous, his head somwhat great, and bald in diuers parts.</p>

               <p>SOme notable signes did prognosticate the death of this our Saint. Because, he lying at <hi>Naples,</hi> so indisposed as he was at first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his departure to the Councell, a most bright starre was seene by two honourable persons of the house of <hi>Coppa,</hi> who were then with
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:12171:274"/>
him, to enter in by the window, and to rest a good while vpon the Saints head. Besides this, some three dayes before his death, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Comet ouer his Inne at <hi>Fossa-noua,</hi> and when he gaue vp the ghost the same vanished away. Moreouer at the very same houre that he was in his passage, a Dominican Father of great vertue, by name <hi>Fryar Paul Aquilin,</hi> in the Conuent of <hi>Naples,</hi> saw in his sleep, how S. <hi>Thomas</hi> reading in the same Citty vnto a great Auditory, <hi>S. Paul</hi> entred into the Schoole, with a great troupe of Saints in his company, and the Angelicall Doctour being willing to descend from the chayre, the Apostle commanded him to proceed in his les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: and at last demaunding of the same Apostle, whether he had penetrated the sense of his Epistles or no; he answered: Very well truly, as much as humane vnderstanding in a mortall body can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly arriue to. But I wil lead thee into a place, where thou shalt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand them much better: and heere with taking him by the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he lead him out of the Schoole. And <hi>Fryar Paul</hi> began to cry out with a loud voyce: Help Brothers help, because <hi>Fryar Thomas</hi> is taken away. At which cryes of his, many in hast running in, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring wherefore, he declared vnto them the whole vision in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The houre was noted, and diligent inquisition being made thereupon, it was found, that at that very instant the blessed soule departed from the body.</p>
               <p>Many miracles afterwards of health, and of other supernaturall effects, ensued to the perpetuall prayse and exaltation of the Saint, which would be too long &amp; superfluous to relate in this place. But howbeyt by such euents, is discouered in a manner the greatnes of the merits and rewards of the man of God; yet more euident testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony therof, gaue another vision, which <hi>Fryar Albert</hi> a Dominica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Brescia</hi> had afterwards, being a man very famous alike both in san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity and learning. This man being giuen to the doctrine of <hi>S. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> and much deuoted to his diuine vertues, had now a great while desired to know, what degree of glory he was to haue in Heauen. With this ardent desire, being once in prayer with teares, before an Aultar of the most Blessed Virgin, after many enflamed sighs and feruent prayers, there appeared at last two persons vnto him, no lesse venerable in aspect, then for ornament and splendour admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: the one in <hi>Pontificalibus,</hi> with a Miter on his head, another with the habit of the Dominican Fathers, with two very rich chaines about their neckes, one of gold, the other of siluer, and a
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:12171:275"/>

               <p>Then he in the miter sayd: Brother <hi>Albert,</hi> what lookest thou on? I am <hi>Augustine,</hi> the Doctour of the Church, sent hither to let thee vnderstand the glory of <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquine,</hi> who is now-heere present with me, in following the Apostolicall traditions, and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrating the Church of Christ. That same so resplendant iewel which thou seest at his breast signifyes a most right intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which he hath had continually in teaching and defending the Catholike fayth. Those other pretious stones heere and there, do shew the multitude and variety of bookes he hath written, and put to light for the help of soules. In summe we are both equall in the essential of glory; for the rest he exceeds me in virginall purity, and I him in Pontificall Excellency: which saying they vanished away. Of this singular chastity of the holy Doctour, besydes what hath been sayd allready, there appeared very euident signes thereof in his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls.</p>

               <p>A Litle after the corps of S. <hi>Thomas</hi> was enterred, the Abbot of <hi>Fossa-noua</hi> with others of the Conuent, fearing that such a treasure would be taken away from them, especially since <hi>Fryar Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginald,</hi> by Notary, &amp; witnesses now had consigned him as <hi>in depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sito;</hi> in the midst of the night, they secretly conueighed him into the Chapell of S. <hi>Steuen.</hi> But <hi>S.

Whereupon being terrifyed, he went with some lay men vnto the sayd Chapell of S. <hi>Steuen,</hi> opened the sepulcher, from whence proceeded an odour so fragrant, as presently drew thither all the rest of the Monks, in whose presence, that chast lodging of the holy Ghost, was found to be wholy and throughout entire, together with the garments. Being a thing somuch the more to be wondred at, as the place was more humid, and the body (as hath been sayd) more full and corpulent. Replenished then with all consolation and meruaile atonce, they honourably conueighed him back where he was at first. And the day following hauing a

               <p>The Monkes of <hi>Fossa-noua</hi> resented the iniury, and for the same hauing made many tymes complaints to the Sea Apostolike.

Nor did any thing hinder them from fullfilling their vow then sterility, or want of fruit to present: from which being deliuered through the intercession of the same Virgin they at last had a sonne, in Baptisme called by the name of <hi>Andrew,</hi> for being borne on the feast of that glorious Apostle. But the day before his natiuity, for a cleare presage, as it were of thinges to come; it seemed to the Mother in sleep, that she was deliuered of
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:12171:277"/>
a Wolfe, which turning into the Church, was by little and little transformed into a Lambe. At which apparition, though <hi>Peregrina</hi> remayned in some feare, yet made she no kind of demonstration thereof, but kept it secret vntill the tyme we shall speake of anone.</p>
               <p>In the meane tyme, the faythfull parents trayned vp the child in learning, and much more in manners, with that care, as was fit for the yssue now dedicated already to the seruice of the Queene of Angells. But soone might be gathered in him without doubt, how prone to ech vice is human kind, without the particular ayde and stay of celestiall grace. Scarcely was he arriued to the vse of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, when being enflamed within, by the ardours of concupiscence, and by the incentiues of the false Angell, and outwardly allured by sensible obiects, and lewd companyes; he began, from the straight and direct way of saluation, to bend to the spacious and large way of perdition, to abhorre vertue, to fly his studyes, to serue the belly, and dishonest pleasures, to follow the dissolute, to giue himselfe to pompes, to handle partly cards and dice, &amp; partly also his sword, and armes prohibited, to moue often quarells, and to challenge now this man, and now that into the field, to wast the goods of his family, and to put himselfe continually into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers both of body and soule.</p>
               <p>These manners of his euen pierced the Parents to the hart, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming very vnfit for one, so conceiued through prayers, &amp; brought vp for the seruice of the Mother of God. In the meane while they sought, now with allurements, and now with menaces, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne with reasons, to pull him back from the precipices he ran into, without stay, but all in vayne. The fierce youth had now shaken off the yoke, he champed the bridle, he scorned the rod, &amp; finally became euery day more rebellious, and refractary then other. Yet for all this the diuine Clemency, would not suffer so ill a bud of so good rootes should eternally perish, but through meanes vnexpected reformed him on a sudden, in the height of his deba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shments. Because hauing once among other tymes, answered not only with contempt and contumacy to the holsome aduises of them that loued him so deerely, but euen also with iniuryes and outrages very impiously turning his back towardes them; <hi>Peregrina</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring her ancient dreame: Thou art surely (sayd she to him) that infamous wolfe, which in vision I seemed to bring forth into the world, when thou wast borne.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="347" facs="tcp:12171:277"/>
At the sound of which words, B. <hi>Andrew,</hi> as awaked through diuine operation, as it were from a deepe letargy, and returning to himselfe, stood still, and with voyce and countenance altered, turning himselfe to <hi>Peregrina:</hi> I beseech you, sweet Mother (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed he) not to hide from me longer that monstruous prodigy, which you now intimated to me: whence how beyt on the one side I find my selfe terrifyed &amp; astonished as stroke with a thunderbolt, yet me thinkes on the other, I doe feele my selfe to burne with so ardent desire, to know the full truth, as I shall neuer be at rest, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till you giue me a faythfull and distinct notice thereof.</p>
               <p>Then the disconsolate Matron, being moued from the bottome of her hart, and now brought into some hope of amendment in her Sonne: Know thou, sayd she, my beloued Sonne, that after my es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pousals I liued many yeares without yssue, but with so great desire thereof, that to obtayne the same I promised and obliged, with so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne vow to the seruice of the diuine Maiesty and to his most holy Mother, the first Sonne that should spring from my wombe. Thy Father also concurred in the same vow with me, and with the same deliberation which I did. Nor was the remedy in vayne. The Conception followed, &amp; now being neare to those pangs of child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth, I dreamed I was deliuered of a Beast, which entring into the Temple in the figure of a wolfe, was changed into that of a lambe. The day following wast thou brought forth into the world. What thou hitherto hast shewed thy selfe to the world, thou knowst very well, and that surely no rational creature, but a sauage &amp; rauenous wild beast. It were now high tyme thou conuertedst thy selfe, and helpedst vs in good order, to repay what we owe as debtours for thee. For neyther to <hi>Nicolas,</hi> nor <hi>Peregrina</hi> wast thou borne, but rather to the Virgin Mary. A wake then my Hart now, once at last, nor goe thou on so blotting that victime, that should liuing and cleane be presented to the highest. By these, &amp; such other words, full of iust disdayne, and of most tender affect, through diuine power, that stony breast, was mollifyed and compunct at last, who casting his eyes with horrour on his actions past, became on a sudden to be a bitter accuser of himselfe. And finding no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remedy, then to humble himselfe, to craue pardon, and to procure aduocates, he went the next day to the Carmelites, being a Family by an ancient Institute applyed to the honour of the most Blessed Virgin. Heere then being prostrate before her Aultar,

as well for shame of his offences as feare of the punishments, with a blush and palenes enterchangeably, going and comming in his countenance, without motion of his lipps, and with deep sighes, he remayned a good while begging of succour, and mercy at her hands.</p>

               <p>VVHyle B. <hi>Andrew</hi> was in that agony aforesaid, he was let see by diuine power, his debts to haue gone so farre, &amp; growne to be so great, as there was no way to be acquit of them, but to change himself, &amp; to leaue the world; &amp; to deale with some creditour, so exact and rigid on the one side, who should sift out al what possible he might, without leauing a dram; and so magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and courteous on the other, that for so vnequall a payment, should giue not only a full acquittance, but an Eternity moreouer. The contrite yong man was not backward awhit to these heauenly consayls. He goes in all hast to Father <hi>Hierome Migorato</hi> Prouinciall of the Order, and beseeches him on his knees, he would be pleased to accept him into the number of his subiects, he being most resolute to leaue the world, &amp; promptly to follow the Euangelical cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sails.</p>
               <p>With this short manner of speach, so accorded his gestures and actions withall, as left no place of sinister suspitions to any. The holy and discreet Superiour notwithstanding, regarding the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lityes of so noble and delicate a subiect, partly to assure himselfe the better of his vocation, and partly also to auoyd all scandall; giuing good words for that tyme to the suiter, sends by an expresse messenger to certify <hi>Nicolas Corsino,</hi> &amp; <hi>Peregrina</hi> his wife, how their Sonne <hi>Andrew</hi> had made great instance for Religion, and the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit. More ioyfull tydings could not possibly arriue to the eares of the good and truly Christian couple. But both full of ioy and iubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley alike giue infinite thankes therefore to the diuine goodnes: after which without delay they went both togeaher vnto the Conuent, where the feruorous Penitent anew, was set to prayer at the same Aultar as before. With this opportunity they likewise falling on their knees, being quiet, and all of one accord made the defired o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blation of him, and so performed their vow. From thence the holy busynes being concluded with the Prouinciall, the Father and Mother being wholy replenished with consolation, returned home

agayne, while the sonne so altered now and quite transformed with the singular content and edification of the Fryars, remayned in the Monastery; nor cared he awhit to change his name, while to him it seemed the name of <hi>Andrew,</hi> would be a sufficient incitement for him to loue and embrace the Crosse of our Lord Christ. And he conuerted his thoughts &amp; applyed his whole mind by all meanes possible to suppresse the vices which infested him most, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culerly pride, and a vayne esteeme of himselfe.</p>
               <p>In which battayle besides the actions which he did of his owne accord, in submitting himselfe to others, and flying all shew and demonstration of vanity, he was much furthered likewise by mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters skillfull in that Religious list. Who exercised him in those oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations point by point, which were most accommodate to abate pride, and to subdue the appetite of disordinate excellency. So as they deputed him to the vile seruices of the kitchin, to wash the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, to sweep the house, to cary away the dust, to serue &amp; wayte at the porch; which things he discharged with so great simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and feruour, as they were all astonished thereat, and he remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned euery day more confirmed, then other in his good purposes.</p>

               <p>Vnto this loue of purity, and contempt of himselfe, and of true pennance indeed, and voluntary pouerty, was added an inflamed desire, and zeale of saluation of soules, whereto he attended not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with feruent prayers, and good examples of life, but also as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion serued, with exhortations, counsailes and aduises.

To this promise of his the sick man, though he could hardly afford any credit, yet for the great desire he had to be rid of his paynes, did offer himselfe very prompt and ready to any thing that B. <hi>Andrew</hi> should please to commaund him.</p>

Then answered the seruant of Christ: I will haue thee the first thing thou dost, to relinquish this ill practise and conuersation of Gamesters; and after that, for eight dayes, that thou attend to Fasting, and to recommend thy selfe hartily to the most Blessed Virgin. The conditions seemed hard to <hi>Iohn,</hi> and yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to make some try all thereof, vsing some violence to himselfe, he dismissed and abandonned the euill companyes, and with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence and prayer, made the Mother of God so propitious to him, as not without the amazement of the whole Citty, and his infinite ioy, he was cured, both of the Vlcer, which deuoured his flesh, and of the greedy appetites, which vnder a false shadow of good, consumed his sensuall and vnwary soule. Such then were the actes which B. <hi>Andrew</hi> practised with his neighbour, full of simplicity &amp; truth; by whose meanes we may well beleeue, that many others at that tyme, were weaned from vices, and confirmed in vertue.</p>

               <p>It was in tymes past, and is yet to this day, a custome in <hi>Florence,</hi> as in other places of Christendome also, to make feasts at the first Masse of a new Preist, with musique, pompes, and banquetes: which demonstrations of ioy and gladnes, as they are not to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, while they are kept with in the bounds of a moderate festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity; so when they exceed the same, there is much danger incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, least Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ceremonyes degenerate into gentil, &amp; prophane, and that in operations of the spirit, and mind, the flesh and belly may intrude themselues; and finally least in the seruice and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship due to God only, the diuell (a fearefull thing) should haue his part therein.

considering such pompes were not any thing conformable with his profession, and worthily fearing some manner of abuse therein, with leaue of the Prelate, retired himselfe into a Conuent, which is called by the name of the <hi>Sylua,</hi> some seauen miles forth of the Citty; and heere as without all noyse, so with extraordinary spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall sweetenes, he offered his first sacrifice to the most holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which how gratefull and acceptable it was, the Emperesse of Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her selfe did testify, who ouer that same vnbloudy hoast, appeared to B. <hi>Andrew</hi> encompassed with a troupe of Angells, and with the words of <hi>Esay</hi> the Prophet very plainely sayd to him: <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uus meus es tu, &amp; in te gloriabor.</hi> Which sayd, by little and little mounting aloft, she vanished quite.</p>
               <p>With which fauours, the prudent man not puffed vp awhit, but rather attending to abase himselfe, and to acknowledge all good to proceed from the meere benignity of the highest, became euery day more worthy, and more capable of new graces. So as a little after the aforesayd vision, being sent to <hi>Paris,</hi> to giue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe more exactly to his studyes, and thence afterwardes in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne into Italy passing by <hi>Auignon,</hi> where the Cardinall <hi>Corsino</hi> his neere kinsman was, while there he entertayned himselfe for some space, he gaue sight to a blind man, who in the Church porch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to custome was publikely begging an Almes.

With which humanity and bounty of his, how much the Giuer of al good was pleased, very manifestly appeared in tyme of a cruel Dearth, wherewith the people of <hi>Fesula</hi> being much tormented &amp; oppressed, not finding on earth any retuge more fit and opportune then the benignity of their Bishop, they came running in troupes vnto him, and he shut not vp his coffers, or dispense from any: in so much as hauing one day very liberally distributed what bread was in the house, and now beggars continually comming in, he commanded more bread to be giuen vnto them; and his seruants knowing very well, there was not so much as a loafe left, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauoured to certify the Maister therof, who notwithstanding per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuering in calling for it, and bidding them earnestly to seeke yet better; they not to seeme contumacious, though against their wils, turning backe, found to their extreme wonder a great quantity of loaues, and with great ioy brought them to the man of God. Which presently he deuided among the hungry, imitating in this also, the mercy, and representing the infinite power of the Sauiour. Besides this, he was wont truly, in memory of our sayd Redeemer and Lord, the singular Maister of holy humility, to wash euery Thurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day with his owne handes the feet of some poore folkes, wherin he felt particuler gust and consolation.</p>
               <p>Now it happened once, that among those Beggars, was called in one, who had his legs in a loatsome manner very soare and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, who as he was well bred and modest, began to resist the admirable man, not suffering by all meanes he should wash his feet: and B. <hi>Andrew</hi> demanding wherefore?

Nor was the prediction awhit in vayne, because he being now come to nineteen years of age, when as man commonly stands vpon the point of taking the good, or ill bent; in vision there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him a woman more bright then the Sunne, who with a pleasing and gratefull countenance spake to him in this sort.</p>
               <p>My beloued youth, why distracts thou thy hart into diuers parts, and seekest rest forth of thy selfe, now in this thing, and now in that? Looke what thou wishest for, is in my handes, and I promise to affoard it thee, if thou wilt take me to thy Spouse. At which wordes <hi>B. Laurence</hi> being at first astonished, and taking after more courage, to demand her name, and what her condition was, the Virgin replyed: I am the Wisedome of God, who for refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the world heeretofore haue taken mortall flesh. Which the happy <hi>Louer</hi> hearing, soone yielded his assent; and she reaching him a chast kisse of peace, very suddenly vanished. At this vision now B. <hi>Laurence</hi> being stirred vp to new cares, &amp; feeling vnwon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted flames of fire to burne within his breast, yet could not fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprete the inuitation made him, nor to which to betake himselfe aboue others.

                  </gap>ing to his owne iudgment, he went for counsaile to a certaine Cousin of his Mother, called <hi>Marinus,</hi> who leading a monasticall life in S. <hi>Georges</hi> of <hi>Alga,</hi> of the Congregation of <hi>Celestines,</hi> was held in great opinion of learning and sanctity.</p>
               <p>He now vnderstanding the inspiration and motiues of the yong

man more maturely to examine the whole, exhorted him first ere he entred into Religion, or changed the habit, he would secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make some experience, what he were able to suffer in a strict life. To which aduice <hi>B. Laurence</hi> did very promptly obey, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other industryes, began insteed of a soft and downy bedde, to ly in the night vpon crabby and knotry wood. And with all to make his accompts the better, he endeauours of purpose one day, to contemplate on the one side Magistracyes, Honours, Wiues, Children, riches, sundry sorts of pastimes and sports, and all the pleasure besides which the world may afford; and on the other, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinencyes, fasts, vigills, pouerty, incommodityes, heat &amp; cold, the abnegation of himselfe, with perpetuall seruitude, and other difficultyes besides, which present themselues in the narrow way of more perfect vertue, and diuine seruice.</p>
               <p>Heereupon as an Arbitour placed betweene two troupes of obiectes, demanded he accompt of himselfe, saying: Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider well <hi>Laurence,</hi> what thou hast to do: Dost thou thinke thou canst endure these austerityes, and despise those commodityes? Whereupon standing in suspense and contention within himselfe, at last casting his eyes vpon a Crosse of Christ: Thou art (sayd he) my hope, O Lord, in this tree is found comfort and strength for all, a secure &amp; safe refuge for all. And without doubting any more, he determined by all meanes to follow the internall voyce, and counsayles of the Chiefe Pastour.</p>

               <p>IT cannot easily be explicated, how much seruour and spirit was augmented in that blessed soule from that so free and well grounded resolution which B. <hi>Laurence</hi> made. Which howbeyt he laboured to hide by all meanes possible: yet could he not so do, but those of the howse, especially his Mother must needes find it out. Whereupon she, though vertuous and deuout, yet tender and anxious for her deer sonne, fearing least through violence of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he might come to be transported vnto some hardy enterprize beyond his forces, she determined vpon agreement with others, to ty him, as soone as might be, with the bands of Matrimony. So at hauing practically proceeded therein without delay, she soone
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:12171:285"/>
found out, and offered him a beautyfull, noble, and rich spouse. But the holy youth being aware of the temptation, and conspiracy of his freinds, would deferre no longer, to rid himselfe of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and to conuey himselfe as secretly as he could, vnto S. <hi>Georges:</hi> where taking the habit of Religion, he manfully began to enter into the battayle, against the inuisible Enemy.</p>
               <p>The first assault then, he gaue to Sensuality, depriuing himselfe of all wantonnes, and disports. To hungar he gaue but that only, which euen the vtmost necessity required. Thirst he did tolerate, in such sort, as that neyther for the vehemency of heates, nor weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the iourneys he made, or other labours whatsoeuer, nor for any indisposition of body, would he euer call for drinke. But rather if sometymes, he were inuited therunto, he was wont to answere: how then Brothers shal we be able to endure the fire of Purgatory, if we cannot suffer this litle thirst? At the vigils at night, and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyns, he was the first in coming thither, &amp; the last to depart from thence: for that, it being the custome of others, to returne to bed againe vntill the rising of the Sunne; the B. <hi>Laurence</hi> would neuer goe out of the Church, vntill the hower of prime. He would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer approch to the fire, not so much as in the hart of winter: a thing so much the more to be admired in so delicate a complexion.</p>
               <p>A certaine Father one day inuited him to warme himselfe at the lyre, and not being able to be brought vnto it, he felt his hand, and finding it to be benumm'd through cold, he cryed out: Great is the ardour O Sonne, thou hast within thee since thou feelest not the extremity of cold without. But what great wonder is it, that he approached not to the fyre, who neuer went as it were into the garden likewise, being the only recreation, and ordinary disport of the Monks? At diuine offices he would stand bolt vpright, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leaning awhit eyther on the right or left hand. He would se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly make most cruell disciplines; as testifyed the many stripes all black and blew, through his whole body, with the frequent staynes of bloud thereon appearing.</p>
               <p>In the dolours of infirmityes, he would shew incredible pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. Being yet a Nouice, his neck was full of swelling of the Kings euill. The Phisitians for a last and only remedy threatned him first cuppings, then launcings, and lastly searing with fire. And the Fryats doubting, he would faynt vnder the cure, he coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously answered: what feare you Brothers? Let come the rasor,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:12171:286"/>
bring in the burning irons; can not he happily giue me constancy in this daunger, who affoarded it to the three children in the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace? So as he was cut and burned, without fetching the left gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane or sigh, or sending forth other voyce, then Iesus for once only.</p>
               <p>Howbeit indeed, it is no great matter, he should shew such fortitude in the greener, who gaue such an example thereof in his latter age, and perhapps more memorable then it: Because, that being vnmeasurably sweld at that tyme in the throate, and being not able to resolue the corrupt humour thereof without incision of the knife, the Father being desirous to be rid of the trouble, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend more freely to the care of soules, stood still at that launcing as quiet and vnmoueable as a stock, speaking to the timourous Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon: Cut on couragiously, for thy rasour can not exceed the burning hot irons of the Martyrs. In this sort, the flesh being van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished quite, and subdued, and the noble Warrier, with full &amp; perfect renunciation, quitting himselfe to his power, of al terrene charge, endeauours to conquer the other impietyes one by one; so much more powerfull and daungerous, as more inward and spirituall they be. But the principall fight which he tooke in hand, was against that horrible monster of Pride, taming it as well in the interiour as exteriour, with contrary, frequent, and intense actes. The garmentes that he wore were all torne; the more abiect offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and more noysome of the Monastery, (most manfully therein, subduing his stomack for the loue of Christ) he would take to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
               <p>Besides, he stucke not to go forth a begging of almes, with a Wallet on his backe. And wholy to trample vnder foot the foolish reputation and vayne pride of the world, he would put himselfe of purpose into the thickest nobility, and where the greater concourse of the inhabitants was. He would come also sometimes to the very house, where he was borne, and remayning in the streets be crying aloud, <hi>for Gods sake.</hi> At which words and voyce of his, the mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bowells being mooued, to cut off at least the walke or circuit of her deere, blotid, she suddenly commanded the seruants to fill vp his wallet with victualls. But he contenting himselfe with two leauer of bread, and wishing peace to such as had done him the charity, would depart from thence as altogeather vnknowne, and so com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

to S. <hi>Georges</hi> agayne</p>
               <p>Being further prouoked, though altogeather vniustly truly, with other occasions, or reprehended for some thing, he would force himselfe (in biting his tounge sometymes) to represse the naturall vehemency, which the Children of <hi>Adam</hi> haue to iustify and defend themselues. Through which exercise, by little and little he got such a power ouer himselfe, as that being once accused in the open Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, by a peruerse man, for hauing committed in gouernment something against the rule, though he knew the malignity of him, &amp; could haue yielded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a good accompt of himselfe; notwithstanding without opening his mouth, or changing his countenance, arising from his seate, with eyes cast downe to the earth, and with a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate pace, he went into the midest of the Chapter, and there falling downe on his knees, craued humbly pennance, and pardon of all those Fathers: so as the accuser himselfe being quite confounded at so great a patience of his, could not hold from casting himselfe at the feet of that innocent, and in the presence of all to condemne his owne malignity. And as in publike acts, so likewise in priuate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation would <hi>D. Laurence</hi> most willingly yield to the iudgement and wills of others, and as much as he might without affectation, alwayes seeke the lowest place.</p>
               <p>He bare all respect, and veneration to Superiours, he held their becks insteed of Oracles. Nor only in things at large, and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, by cutting off all sensuall appetite, he purely followed their will; but euen also in things other wise very lawfull and vertuous, captiuing his owne vnderstanding, would not dissent a whit from their rules and dictamens. Whence it happened (as all vertues are with a wonderfull harmony conioyned together) that the seruant of God, very perfectly acquiring a habit of Religion, became rich and adorned with many others at the same tyme. Whereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring in his hart, a cleane &amp; gratefull chamber for the holy Ghost, in short tyme he obtayned so high a guift of teares, and so much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with his Creatour and Lord, as that remayning with his body on earth, with his soule he conuersed in Heauen; and dealing with men by diuerse occurrences, he departed not at all from the presence of God; chasing away from himselfe with great dexterity, all importune and superfluous phantasmes. From this purity of conscience, soone after ensued such a light, as far surmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all learning purchased otherwayes, and in the will so great an
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:12171:287"/>
ardour, as all the waters of the world had not beene able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish it. But rather he sought allwayes, to aduance forwardes, according to the obligation of profession, and so much abhorred to turne himselfe, and looke back being (as they say) at the plough, or to reedify that which he had destroyed, or to resume agayne any thing which he had left and renounced in the world, as he could neuer be brought once, to put his foot in his Fathers howse, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he liued so neere vnto them, and his dearest freinds were of the best reputation, and of rare example of Christian vertue: Saue only at the death of his Mother, and Brothers, was he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to assist them with due piety in their last passage.</p>

               <p>B. <hi>Laurence,</hi> had not beene yet many yeares in Religion, when a deere companion of his, in the world, who for this meane while had beene in the East, and but newly returned to <hi>Venice</hi> (so powerfull the instigation of the Diuell is) went presently to S. <hi>Georges,</hi> accompanyed with musique, loud and soft, to allure the new Monke to his former life, partly also with a band of men, to vse some violence with the Conuent, if need were. This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was a man of great employments, and of much respect, so as he obtayned very easily to speake with Blessed <hi>Laurence;</hi> but yet with farre different successe from his designes. Because at the first fight of the new Souldiour of Christ, beholding the modesty of his countenance, the grauity of his gestures, and composition of the whole person, he remayned astonished thereat. And notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vsing some violence with himselfe, and taking courage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, he began the enterprise for which he came thither; but the seruant of God permitting that breast full of passion and youthfull errour to vent it selfe forth, with a cheerefull countenance and mild speaches, began first very dexterously to feele him: &amp; then with the memory of Death, of Hell, and of the last Iudgement, and with liuely representing vnto him, the vanity and deceipts of the world, pressed him so hard, as the good man being now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punct, vpon a sudden yielded himselfe; &amp; so yielded, as cutting of with the force of spirit, all transitory designes whatsoeuer, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to adhere to that Rule, which he had thought to haue vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:12171:287"/>
and from henceforth offering himselfe to the diuine worship, he perseuered <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>n the holy Cloyster, with like profit of his owne, and amazement of the whole Citty. In this manner the ancient aduersary departed, and he who had thought to haue had a prey, was himselfe caught in the net.</p>
               <p>Nor with the seculars only, being free and dissolute, were the perswasions of the B. <hi>Laurence</hi> efficacious (especially his good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and seruent prayers to our Lord concurring with all) but euen also (a thing to my iudgement yet more hard) with the tepid and negligent Religious. Since he awaked some of them more then once from the deadly sleep of slouthfullnes, and withdrew them from a foolish and vnwary presumption, to a sollicitous and wise feare of Christ: others, being now weary with the spirituall war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, or rather basely already put to flight, he caused on a sudden to turne head agayne, and beyond all hope, to stand stoutly in the front of the battayle. For the eminent Pulpit, and popular prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings he wanted strength of body: but yet in priuate assemblyes, he would make sweet homilyes and deuout discourses, to the great profit and consolation of the hearers. And also in his dayly speach, would often proceed very notable sentences from his mouth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof for example sake we shall put downe some.</p>
               <p>He would say, It was not the part of a Religious man to fly only the greater synnes, since that behoued euery one to doe, but euen also, to keepe himselfe from the lesse, least Charity should wax cold. He was wont also to note concerning fastings, that they are not to be remitted wholy as soone as the body waxeth leane, for as much as the wished extenuation thereof, is conserued with that which procures it. Three things he iudged to be necessary for a Monke, to wit, feruour, discretion, and heauenly grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause where any of these are fayling, there can be no perseuerance. He compared the vertue of Humility, to a riuer that swells with rayne: for that euen as a torrent is very low and stil in the sommer, and runs outragious and boystrous in winter; so the humble man, being slack and remisse in prosperity, in aduersity agayne appeares to be high and magnanimous. He added, that no man well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends, what the guift of Humility is, but he that hath receiued it from God, and that there is nothing wherein men are more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, then in discerning this vertue, and how true science con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in knowing two things; that God is all, and man nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="370" facs="tcp:12171:288"/>
In the greater troubles of his Country (which at that tyme was much infested with warrs) he stuck not to admonish the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Senatours, that if they would obtayne mercy of God, they should hold for certaine they were nothing, nor could do any thing of themselues. He aduised that none should be receiued into Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion without mature examine, least by admitting the bad, the good might be hurt. Besides that, when the number of subiects, is too much increased, the Rule cannot long last in its rigour, because per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is of few only.</p>
               <p>A Gentlemans sonne being come to S. <hi>Georges</hi> for the habit, as soone as the Blessed <hi>Laurence</hi> heard that he was induced thither, through the artificious inticements of the Monkes, he renders him to the sollicitous Father with these wordes: Heer take him to you againe, for this renouncing of the world should proceed from the Holy Ghost, and not for human instigation, and much worse it is to fayle afterwards, then to haue neuer begun at all. From the day he was made Priest, he fayld not to celebrate euery day, vnles by occasion of infirmity; and concluded, that he who neglects when he may, to enioy his Lord, declares sufficiently that he maks little account of him. To goe about to keep chastity, amidst commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes and ease, he protested to be as much as with fuell to extinguish the fire. In the matter of Christ his counsails, he resolued (among other thinges) that no man vnderstands, how great a good this Pouerty is, but he that loues, when tyme is, contemplation and his Cell; and that God of purpose keepes secret the felicity of the Religious state, because that if it were knowne, euery one would be running into it.</p>
               <p>He often remembred, that we are neuer to loose our hope in God, since heerin consists the life of the soul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>. As for the rich he affirmed, that they cannot be saued, but by dealing of almes. He held the Pastorall care to be so much more greiuous and difficult then the gouernment of the state of warre is, as the rule of inuisible things is harder then that of the visible. He likened a good Prince to a head, especially for this reason, that euen as the head &amp; tongue are sufficient to craue help for the whole person, though the rest of the body be quiet &amp; stand still; so the seruent prayer of a Prince, sometymes is inough to appeale the wrath of God, though the rest of the Citty apply not it selfe, or attend thereunto. These violent enterprizes, and such as meete with encounters euery foot, he
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:12171:288"/>
counsayled to forbeare, as growing from an euill spirit, since to the good and holy, the diuine Prouidence it selfe, is wont to open the way, and quit the obstacles that hinder.</p>

With the same wisedome surely infused more from Heauen, then borrowed from bookes, he composed diuers workes, fraught as well with souerai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne conceits, as with amorous affects. Which labours being publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quely set forth, and put in print, doe walke and passe at this day through the handes of learned men with notable fruite and help of soules. Amidst these thinges, after the Blessed <hi>Laurence</hi> had giuen a long and sufficient proofe of himselfe, he was elected by the Monkes, full sore against his will, to the gouernement of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and he bare that burthen with singular approbation vnto the 51. yeare of his age.</p>
               <p>At which tyme, the good odour of such vertues, being now spread into diuers parts, it seemed good to Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> the IV. without doubt through diuine inspiration, to create him Bishop of <hi>Venice.</hi> At which tydinges, it may easily be imagined, how much the holy man was confounded and troubled. Twice he was ready to fly away and to hide himselfe: but the matter not succeeding so with him, he determined at last to remit himselfe to the iudgment of his Congregation. And first hauing made for that intent many fastes and prayers, the Fathers resolued at last to dispatch a man of purpose to the Pope, humbly beseeching his Holynes, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue their Order of such and so great a Guide-maister, and Pastour. And being not heard the first tyme, they replyed the second with more instance, but al in vaine, as appeares by the two Briefs, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the same <hi>Eugenius</hi> to the sayd Congregation, with words ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, amorous and consolatory withall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="372" facs="tcp:12171:289"/>
The Blessed <hi>Laurence</hi> then being not able to resist the Pope without sinne, accepted the power in such sort, as he not only chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not his manners to the worse, as it happens, but continually made them more admirable and perfect then euer. One day about the euening, he tooke possession of the Bishopricke, so simply, and so without all pompe, as euen his nearest friendes had no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge therof, till he was entred therinto. Then all that night with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out shutting his eyes, he remayned in prayer, beseeching our Lord with many teares, since for the only seruice of his diuine Maiesty, so wholy against his owne inclination, he had condescended to that degree, he would not depriue him of his protection and clemency: that he knew very well, the importance of the charge, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the Citty, the variety and multitude of the Orders and states, the forces of the secular power; and how great disgusts had passed heeretofore, betweene that Domination and the Bishops his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessours, and how poore a stacke he had for such a manage, and for such accidents, being so a sily wretch as he was, and euer shut vp in a Monastery. His deuout prayers, and seruent sighes, were not powred in vayn. Because they found the eares of the diuine goodnes to be opened to them. Whence, being illustrated with a sudden and new light, he tooke so much vigour and comfort the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reat, as he afterwards gouerned the whole Diocesse, as easely as he had been but to rule some Conuent, as shall appeare in the next Chapter.</p>

He chose out two vertuous companions of his Congregation; one for diuine offices, the other for the more weighty cares of the Bishoprike. For the seruice of the house, he would haue but fiue assistants and no more. To this reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of Courtiers was his Table and Wardrobe answerable. He had no plate but of earthen-glasse. Arras, or Tapistry were not there to be seene at any tyme. In his cloathing he neuer altered the purple habit. In the night he lay vpon a scanty bedde of straw, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering himselfe with a grosse and course rugge. His table by how much more exquisite it was for neatnes, so much the more was it
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:12171:289"/>
purposely neglected in vyandes. He neuer had longing for any thing, nor had as little auersion from any, contenting himselfe euer with that which was set before him.</p>
               <p>His family thus ordered, he gaue himselfe to the reformation of the Citty, beginning first from the Cathedrall Church, which through others default and carelesnesse, had great need thereof. He set the Chapter on foot agayne, &amp; the Order of the Chanons, now brought almost to nothing, and increased it with Priests and petty Chanons and Quiristers. He reduced many other Churches to so good tearmes, where hardly any Masse was wont to be celebrated before, as they seemed to be Cathedrall and Pontificall. Applying himselfe afterwardes to the censure of the Clergy, he made very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Decrees &amp; Constitutions in this nature, nor had he any great difficulty to procure them to be kept and obserued, such was the grace &amp; benignity, wherewith he obliged the harts of his subiects, since he was helpfull to many, and neuer imposed burden vpon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, permitting them fully to enioy the fruites and their rents: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit on the other side, when the matter required, he spared not to vse due seuerity.</p>
               <p>With the same care and loue he dealt with the Monasteryes, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of Nunnes; not suffering the frayle sex to suffer any thing, neyther in the body, or spirit. He repayred the Parishes which were ruined, and erected so many a new, as that finding some 20. of them, with good obseruance he left no lesse then 30. behind him at his death, nor vsed he lesse diligence with all the rest of his flocke. It is incredible, what concourse there was euery day at his house of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed persons, who resorted to him for counsayle &amp; succour. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding he was more particularly vigilant vpon Curates and Vicars, as they call them, reducing often into their memory, the strait accompt they are to make to our Lord God. But how shall we expresse his great liberality? He despised money as much as euer was despised of any. His gate, the dispense, his chests, stood euer open to all the poore. He could not be brought by any meanes to take accompt of the mayster of his house; while it seemed to him an vnworthy thing, that a superintendant for the care of gaining souls, should set himselfe of purpose to cast for farthings. And tooke heed much more, least in the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="374" facs="tcp:12171:290"/>
he alwayes, that the world might cleerely know, how in temporall or oeconomicall matters, he had no manner of commerce at all with his adherents.</p>
               <p>So as, a certayne poore man, being recommended to him, on behalfe of the <hi>Magnifice Leonard</hi> his brother: Go thy wayes (sayd he to him) and bid him from me, to do thee the fauour, since God hath afforded him the meanes. The good Bishop answered to a certaine kinsman of his, not very rich, who demaunded some succour to marry his daughter with: Consider I pray, good Syr, that if I giue you but a little, it is not that which you pretend: and if I giue you much, I shall wrong many to helpe one only. Besides, how litle or much soeuer I hap to giue you, hath been commended to me, by the Church for mayntenance of the poore, and not for iewells, &amp; other ornaments of women. He more willingly gaue almes in bread, wine, wood, garments, and other such like, then in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, to take away (I beleiue) the occasion from many of spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it ill, and when indeed he gaue any mony, he would diuide it into many peeces, that the greater number of the needy and necessitous might participate thereof. Nor in examining their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits was he very scrupulous, or exact; but rather sometymes let himselfe be deceiued, as chosing rather to benefit some vnworthy person, then defraud in the least any well deseruing. True it is that for the bashfull and shame-fac't poore (towardes whom the holy man, had perticular compassion) he had certaine Matrons deputed of much confidence, and of eminent vertue; who by some good way or other, might take faythfull and exact information of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret necessityes of ech, especially of those who from good degrees through diuine permission haue fallen into straits.</p>
               <p>In summe, he was farre from all tenacity, as when with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes he could not furnish others necessityes, he would supply with suretyships for them, or by charging himselfe with their debts. And being demanded by his neerest domestiques, vpon what foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he layd vp his treasure? He would say, of my Lord, who will pay me well for it. Nor was he awhit deceaued of his hope, since when others least thought of it, there would come to him heere and there great quantityes of gold and siluer, that he might dispend them on the poore at his owne pleasure. With all these thinges went vnited togeather a peace and serenity of mind, not easily to be expressed with wordes; as seeming in a certaine manner, he
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:12171:290"/>
held the Moone vnder his feet, and had his mind fixed and seated in a place, where the clouds of sadnes, or the winds, and tempests of other disordinate passions could not reach. And to this purpose I will not spare to touch some thinges, not so light in substance, as they will seeme perhaps at first, if it be true indeed that by sudden accidents habits are knowne.</p>

               <p>THe Blessed <hi>Laurence</hi> being one day set at the table, one of the wayters deceaued (as sometyms it happens) insteed of wine presented him with vinegar, when the good Bishop hauing tasted it, without altering his countenance, or speaking a word, went on with his dinner, and listened to the lesson read, vntill at last the poore seruant aware of the errour, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>craued pardon for his offence. The B. <hi>Laurence</hi> (as we haue sayd aboue) was exceedingly reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced and beloued of the Citty. And yet neuerthelesse sometyms he had potent aduersaries: One whereof, taking by occasion a great disdaine at certaine Canons published against pompes, assembling a great number of men togeather, for the most part very noble &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable personages, laboured of purpose to make an Inuectiue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the seruant of God, tearing him (as he was wont) in his fame, and exhorting all to oppose themselues mainly to the too much se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerity, and the indiscreet seruours of the Monke. In the like te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour spake some few of them, but the others partly refented the same, and partly derided such arrogancy; nor was the conuenticle hardly dissolued, when as one deuoted to the holy Pastour, being exceedingly troubled at those blasphemies cast forth, went present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in great hast to acquaint him with what had happened, and that with words so liuely, and with such ardour of the eyes &amp; gestures, as had beene inough to haue set any one on fire, though he had not beene sensible of the iniury. But the Blessed <hi>Laurence,</hi> not being willing to be further informed, eyther of the fact, or the persons, made answere with a cheerefull countenance: Doe not trouble your selfe, my Sonne, for God will haue care of his honour; and so indeed it fell out, since that wretched accuser with his followers was soone very grieuously punished by the Magistrates vpon other occasions. I will add another example like to this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="376" facs="tcp:12171:291"/>
The vigilant Bishop, with great equity had condemned a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Clerke for ill life, not regarding much the protection which a seditious Lay-man gaue vnto him. Whence this other lewd co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion was so enraged against him for it, as the solemne Procession of <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> passing before his doors, at the approach of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop who carryed that sacred Custody, with a loud voyce he vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited forth a number of vile reproaches &amp; contumelies vpon him, calling him (among other thinges) a Cosener, an Hypocrite, and warning the people to beware of him. From which sacrilegious affront ensued so great a scandall, and choler of the standers by, that the Maiesty and reuerence of that great Feast could hardly hold them from running suddenly with their burning torches, to set his house on fire. But the Priest of God, what did he in this case? Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his eyes fixed on the Venerable Sacrament, without altering his pace awhit, or changing his countenance, he went forwaard with great grauity on his way. Although indeed, without indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the Saint, the vnbridled presumption of the Wretch was soone punished, because being constrained by the Senate, to recant publiquely, he was afterwardes miserably banished also. Nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst persecutions and trauailes likewise the B. <hi>Laurence</hi> would shew himselfe to be stoute and constant, but euen also (a thing much more rare and difficult) amidst fauours and greatnesses them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</p>
               <p>He was more then once inuited by Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> but alwayes in vayne, since he finding out new excuses euery houre, eschewed honours, and pompe as much as others sought them. True it is, the same <hi>Eugenius</hi> being come afterwardes to <hi>Bologna,</hi> and renewing the inuitement, the Seruant of God could no more alleadge, as he was wont, eyther the weaknes of his complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the difficulty and length of the way: so as recommending himselfe to our Lord, he went his wayes thither, and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of many Cardinalls, was very graciously receaued by the Pope, and saluted with these wordes: <hi>VVelcome the ornament, and splendour of the Episcopall order.</hi> And fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> henceforth his Holines with the rest of the Clergy and the Citty, held him in great veneration all the tyme that he remayned there, which was but short, through the care and sollicitude he had, to returne to his Diocesse as soone as might be.

As soone then as the Blessed <hi>Laurence</hi> had notice thereof, to shew himselfe in deedes to be no lesse a good Cittizen, then a good Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man, and a good Bishop, he went to the Senate, and there publiquely declared his desire was to retire himselfe rather, and to lay downe the charge now borne for these eighteene yeares against his will, then now in old age to charge himselfe a new with such a burden. But for as much as the name and title of <hi>Patriarcke</hi> offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by his Holynesse, redounded not so much to his honour, as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Wherfore they should plainely signify in the meane tyme, their owne inclination; since he would wholy gouerne himselfe according therto, in a busynes of that importance, looking alwayes a great deale more into the common good, then to any particuler consolation, or disdaine of his.</p>
               <p>These wordes and the like, sayd the B. <hi>Laurence,</hi> with such affect and candour withall, as the Duke himselfe, through tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, being not able to hold from teares, and the Senatours astoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed at so great a height of courage, conioyned with Charity alike, by a common consent made answere; By all meanes, and without respectes he should accept the offer, as after he did, with the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:12171:292"/>
iubily, and ioy of the whole people.</p>
               <p>About the same tyme, to the new glory of the B. <hi>Laurence,</hi> fell out another thing of great wonder. There liued for more then 30. yeares, neare to <hi>Corfú,</hi> in a craggy and desart place, a Man very famous for continuall prayer, and strict abstinence, and that which men more esteeme of, for a notable spirit of Prophesy. Now the Venetian Republike at that tyme, being much oppressed and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ill termes by the armyes of <hi>Philip Duke</hi> of <hi>Millan:</hi> It came into the mind of a certaine noble Venetian, who had then some busy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse at <hi>Corfú</hi> at that tyme (so curious and sollicitous are men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout future things) to learne of that solitary man, whether true it were, as it was commonly spoken, that the Venetian Empyre was neere vpon ruyne? To which demaund the Prophet answeared without delay: You may all be thankefull to the bitter plaints, and earnest intercessions of your Bishop, without which take this for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne you had now a good while since been quite vndone; &amp; that which had of old happened to those fiue infamous Cittyes, had falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon yours, since you haue so turned your backes to our Lord, and put his holy Law so quite in obliuion.</p>
               <p>This testimony gaue the deuout Hermite of the blessed <hi>Laurence;</hi> not knowing the same by any humane way, nor vnderstanding, but by diuine inspiration, what passed in the world in those dayes. Which thing being suddenly diuulged, confirmed the vniuersall opinion which was then had of such a Patriarke. So as there arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into the Citty of <hi>Venice</hi> no personage of quality, nor pilgrime, (who then for sundry deuotions came flocking from <hi>Hungary, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, France,</hi> and <hi>Spayne)</hi> who endeuoured not to enforme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues exactly of his sharp and austere life; and of his most irrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible manners, to receiue his benediction, to reuerence his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques as holy, the lodging he dwelt in, the Couch where he lay in, and the clothes which he had worne. They neuer tooke vpon them any enterprize of moment, eyther in publike or priuate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hauing recourse to the prayers of this great seruant of God.</p>
               <p>Lastly, he neuer likely went forth of doores, but the people would runne to him, as to an Angell descended from heauen, while euery one held himselfe happy, but only to beho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>VVHat shall we say, of the manner, which B. <hi>Laurence</hi> held, in giuing audience, and dispatch of causes touching his tribunalls? Wherein he had such light &amp; so great dexterity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, as howbeit it he gaue the most part of his tyme, to all other things, yet he seemed to be as borne only and created for this. He would stand amidst the cryes and clamours both of clients and pleaders, as firme as a rock: and after he had listned to the partyes what sufficed (discouering now and then, with more then human vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the secret traces, and frauds which lay often hid) he would breifly then giue sentence, but with such iudgement and equity, as among other things in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> they were allwayes held in a high degree most iust and irrefragable. Nor left he those awhit lesse satisfyed, who came to visit him in priuate, since to be admitted to his presence, there was no need of wayting or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending more fit opportunityes. For whether he studyed, or wrote, or made his prayer, suddaynely cutting of the threed of the present occasion, he would receiue all with such peace and benignity, as he seemed not to be subiect to troubles, or clothed with flesh, but with all loue, all sweetenes, all spirit.</p>
               <p>By these wayes now approaching to the terme of his pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, hardly had he finished the Treatise intituled, <hi>The degr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Whereupon his domestikes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring him a bed, according to his infirmity, the true imitatour of Christ, being troubled at it, sayd to them: What then, doe you make ready feathers for me? My Lord was not layd vpon feathers, but stretched on a hard and cruell bat. And doe you not remember that which S. <hi>Martyn</hi> protested in his last article, that a Christian should dye vpon ashes, and clad in cilices? Finally there was no meanes to lay him otherwise, then vpon his wonted straw. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuing afterwards, to cure his malady, there was no neglect had

               <p>Heereupon presaging his owne death, he recollected himselfe more seriously; and the two contrary affects, Feare, and Hope (as it happened in the like case to the blessed <hi>Hilarion)</hi> began to goe &amp; come with him. So as now with a cheerefull and smiling counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, forbidding teares to the standers by, he exclaymed, Behold the spouse, let vs go, and meere him: and added with eyes cast vp to heauen: Good Iesus, loe I come. And now agayne with iust a ballance weighing the diuine iudgements, he would shew forth signes of Feare: insomuch as a freind of his saying to him, with tender eyes: How willingly, my Lord, may you goe to the palme which is now ready prepared for you? he answered with a graue countenance: this palme, my Sonne, is giuen to the valiant comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Christ, not to the base and cowards as I am. And yet ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king courage at last from his owne conscience, &amp; much more from the merits and Passion of our Sauiour, he goes about to declare his last will.</p>
               <p>And heere now I could wish them present who do greedily amasse vp treasures and rents of the Church, conuerting the stocke of the poore vnto their priuate vse, and with diuers slights continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the sacred benefices in the same family. The faythfull dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour of Christ had not any thing to leaue, hauing allwayes been so great an enemy of all propriety, as that (being a person otherwise so addicted to learning) of purpose, not to seeme to possesse a booke, he had euer studyed in volumes stiched vp only.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and gaue it by diuine priuiledge, to the aforesaid Virgin alone; who, the other being distracted vpon sundry occasions, was euen at the selfe same hower, in secret in her Cell, rapt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in deep contemplation, and burning desire of receauing her Lord. From which office of Charity the Seruant of God returning immediatly againe into himselfe, so ended the Masse, as none of the standers by could beware of what had happened: the Confessour
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:12171:294"/>
only of the Virgin had knowledge thereof, and told it to the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arke, who exhorting them both to yield thankes vnto God only for it, imposed vpon them a strict silence thereof, so long as he liued. And with this, came to be renewed the ancient miracles, which are recounted of some other Saints likewise in the same matter.</p>
               <p>The other miracle was, that after the happy passage of the B. <hi>Laurence,</hi> there growing a contention betweene the Chanons of the Cathedrall, and the Monkes of S. <hi>Georges,</hi> about the custody of that sacred Treasure; and there wanting no reasons for eyther part, it was necessary while the strife was deciding, to keepe it <hi>in deposito</hi> aboue ground; and so being a day or two, not only without signe of corruption, but with yielding also a most sweet odour, on the third day, began moreouer the cheeks to looke red, and the bloud to come, with so much the greatet astonishment of all, as they were certifyed, there was vsed no preseruatiue of Balmes, or of any other druggs about the same; and the Phisitian sincerely affirmed, the feauer to haue been malignant and pestilent, and of its nature apt inough to corrupt withall. Whereof the rumour, running through the Citty, there was agayne such a multitude and presse of people at the Gates, as from the Sacristy where he was kept, they were fayne to cary him to the Temple, to satisfy the peoples eyes, who not contended with a simple view, began with an audacious piety, to seize on his reliques, so as his shoes on a sudden were va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, his garments were cut asunder, and perhaps the feruour had proceeded further, if betymes remedy had not been found by a Guard set vpon the body.</p>
               <p>From thence, being conueighed backe againe into the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cristy, it perseuered entire, vntill notwithstanding the Order left by him, sentence was giuen in fauour of the Chanons; while in the Cathedrall Church remayned a continuall concourse of people men and women, who being stirred vp at so great a newes, came running thither, not only from the neighbour-countreyes there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, but euen also from diuers partes of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Sclauony</hi> it selfe, for the space of 65. dayes; at the end whereof still vntouched as at the first, in the same Cathedrall, it was reuerently layd in a Vault, which to this day also is visited by the faythfull with much deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not without fruit, since that Blessed spirit, being there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked, obtaynes them many graces from Heauen. And to speake some thing also of his exteriour person, the holy man was tall of
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:12171:294"/>
stature, of well knit ioyntes, of a pale coulour, of gracious eyes, and the whole aspect both venerable and amiable; a thing truly not vsuall, because indeed we do see many fayre soules to be enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the mighty hand, and sweet disposition of the Highest in proportionable lodgings. To whom be all prayse, power, and glory, for all Eternity.</p>
