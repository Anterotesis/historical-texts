            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MIne own dear fleſh without (or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,)
Mine own Life and Spirit
within (or inwards,) where-ever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed,
however clouded. I am of kin unto you,
of your fleſh and of your bone; My Life, my
Spirit, my Subſtance is one with yours; why
are we ſo ſtrange one to another? we are all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
by one Father, [For we are all of his off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring]
and therefore cannot but be brethren;
and who knoweth how ſweetly and harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
we lay tumbling together in the ſame
womb of Eternity, before we were brought
<pb facs="tcp:117369:4"/>
forth in theſe ſeverall ſtrange ſhapes, wherein
we now appear? What, ſhall a few momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany
varieties and contrarieties (fitted only for
ſome preſent deſign) make perpetuall inroads
upon everlaſting Unity? Ariſe, awake, ſhake
off your diſguiſes, open your eyes, let us look
one another in the Face, let us look into one
another and ſee, if we can then forbear know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and owning one another?</p>
            <p>But why do I thus ſpeak? Diſpenſations,
and the fight under Diſpenſations, is not yet
ended. We muſt contend and remain ſtrange
a while longer. There is a gulf yet between us,
that we cannot meet. Light and Love hath not
yet overcome us. Ye cannot know me, if it
were ſo, that I knew you. Ye muſt proſecute
me with hatred, though I ſhould woo you
with the greateſt and entireſt Love. Well; Let
things be as they are, ſince they cannot be alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
The time is at hand, wherein time ſhall be
no more; and then whatever had a Being in
time, ſhall ceaſe from ſo being any longer. We
muſt all to the grave, to the duſt; We muſt all
ſleep an Eternall ſleep, when once the laſt Night
comes; where we ſhall bury all our quarrels
<pb facs="tcp:117369:4"/>
and contentions, and awake in perfect life and
love: and then we ſhall be, both to our ſelves
and to one another, what now we cannot ſo
much as deſire to be.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, Farewel: For I muſt retire
into my ſecret corner, to lament and bewail
that Miſery and Deſolation, which is ſeizing
upon all things, by Thoſe Flames, which have
already broken forth, and are ready more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully
and Univerſally to break forth upon the
preſent ſtate of things both outward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
to deface that beauty and luſtre where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
hitherto they have ſhined. And who can
forbear weeping at the ſight of this, who
hath his eye opened to behold it, and hath any
creaturely ſenſe left in him? Certainly none but
he, who hath another eye alſo opened, a more
piercing eye, which is able to look through
all this, and behold a truer, a greater, a more
perfect, a more everlaſting glory, ſown in and
ſpringing up out of the aſhes of theſe. And he,
who indeed beholds this, may skip and leap
in the flames, even while they are faſtning upon
and burning up himſelf. He, who thus knoweth
God, may truſt him with himſelf, and with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb facs="tcp:117369:5"/>
thing elſe, and cannot diſ-reliſh him in his
moſt hidden tracks of Univerſall and moſt
dreadfull deſtructions. He, who Loves the
true God vvith all his heart, vvill eaſily ſay;
Burn up Heaven and Earth at the very roots;
let there be no reliques left of any thing that I
have taſted, enjoyed, hoped for; and then I ſhall
be ſure to meet vvith none but God, to love
none but God, to deſire none but God, vvhen
there is no beauty left any vvhere elſe to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,
nor nothing of that left in me, vvhich
did deſire any thing beſides Him.</p>

                  <p>For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down

in Ordinances, for to make in himſelf, of twain, one new

                  <p>And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the croſs,
having ſlain the enmity in himſelf.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <q>
               <hi>For he is our peace,</hi>
            </q>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is Nothing but offence and war (both
in the cauſe, and in the effect) between
God and the Creature. Every thing in
God, as it is beheld by the Creature, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
the Creature, and inciteth and
draweth forth the enmity of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
againſt it. Every thing in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as it is beheld by God, provokes his
jealouſie and indignation likewiſe: So
that there is nothing but a conſtant inveterate War between
Heaven and Earth, which ſhould and muſt be aſſiſtant and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:117369:6"/>
ſubſervient one to another, or loſe their own delights.</p>
            <p>But ſhall it always be thus? Shall God and the Creature ever
thwart and croſs, and never pleaſe one another, nor be pleaſed in
one another?</p>
            <p>No, it ſhall not always be ſo: When the great Peace-maker
cometh to put forth his skill, he ſhall prevail to make peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them. He will go through his undertaking, though he loſe
his life in it: and yet will he not loſe his life in it, unleſs he be ſure
thereby to accompliſh it. If he dye, the root of Enmity in the
Creature, and in God too, muſt dye with him: (for the oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and enmity in both is equal, or if in either it be ſuperior, it is in
God; and it is an harder task to reconcile God to the Creature,
then the Creature to God; and therefore in wiſdom, that was firſt
undertaken, and Reconciliation never preached to the Creature,
until the foundation of Pacification in him, was layd.)</p>
            <q>
               <hi>He is our peace,</hi>
            </q>
            <p>There is no approach, no converſe, no ſweet intercourſe between
God and the Creature, but in him, by him, through him. If he
had not been <hi>the Propitiatory Sacrifice</hi> to reconcile God firſt, there
ſhould never have been any motion to the Creature to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled.
But now he hath offered up that Principle of life whereby
he lived, and whereby the Creature lives, freely giving it back into
his hands from whom he received it, that now he himſelf can live
no longer, nor the Creature neither (the root of its life being ſlain)
there is no foundation of offence or controverſie left between God
and him, or between God and the Creature, ſo far as it is found
dead or dying in him. So that we, who are <hi>dead in Chriſt,</hi> who
are <hi>dying into Chriſt,</hi> who are filling up the remainders of his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
in our own ſpirits, are now at peace; And he, by his death for
us, by his death in us, by his blood which he poured out and pours
out to death in us, is our peace; which till he hath poured out
perfectly, we ſhall never finde him perfect peace unto us.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Who hath made both one,</hi>
            </q>
            <p>There was but one at firſt: yet in this one was all manner of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117369:6"/>
variety and diſtinction. As all was produced out of one, ſo all was
in that one before it was produced. There was but one maſs of
Earth, and yet what multitudes of things were brought forth out
of it? There was but one <hi>Adam,</hi> and yet this one was made into
two, and out of theſe two, what thouſands of generations have
proceeded?</p>
            <p>And this great lump being brought forth, though they are all
the ſame, <hi>all of one blood,</hi> yet they are cut out into two parcels,
<hi>Jews and Gentiles:</hi> And they are as diſtinct as may be. Diſtinct in
their <hi>race,</hi> in their <hi>God,</hi> in their <hi>Laws, Ordinances, deſires, ends,
hopes.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> muſt not be like the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in any thing: The
<hi>Gentiles</hi> will not be like the <hi>Jews</hi> in any thing. Oh how diverſe,
how diſtinct, nay how contrary are they! But this diverſity, this
diſtinction, this contrariety muſt not always laſt. When Chriſt
comes forth to give up that principle of life in himſelf, and to ſlay
it in them, whereby they have thus lived, the leaves and fruit of
variety and diſtinction will ſoon wither, and they will all ſhrink
back into unity and harmony again.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were both one, but were made dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent:
But there is a time for that difference to be unmade, to be
taken away, and then they will become one again.</p>
            <p>But how can this be? Why the Next words tell you.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>And hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us:</hi>
            </q>
            <p>There is nothing hinders them from being one, but that which
parts them; if that be broken down, they muſt needs be one. If
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> had not been parted, they could never have become
two: If that partition be taken away, they cannot but become
one again.</p>
            <p>Here are three things held forth.</p>
            <p>1. What it is that maketh the difference between things, and that
is <hi>a wall ſet up in the midst.</hi> It is by a wall ſet up betwixt them
that they come to be ſevered and parted one from another. <hi>God</hi>

            <p>There is not ſuch an Original and real difference between them,
as we fools imagine, It is but a made difference, a difference which
becomes ſo by the ſetting up of a wall, which is very vaſt and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcileable
to that eye which ſeeth onely the difference, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
pierce into that Original Union and Oneneſs that was between
them, and could alone be diſcerned before this wall was ſet up.</p>
            <p>2. How this difference ſhall be taken away; and that is <hi>by the
breaking down of this wall,</hi> by the laying this partition flat, by the
taking away all thoſe Ordinances, Laws, and Conſiderations,
which make either the one or the other ſo to be. That which
makes <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs, Holineſs</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Faith</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief,</hi> as it had a time to be ſet up, ſo it ſhall
be pulled down again, and where will then the difference between
theſe things be? There will be a difference and a vaſt difference,
while the partition wall laſts, but when that is gone, there will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
not ſo much as a ſhadow of difference any longer: When that
is wholly taken away, which did in any wiſe part them, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but become perfectly one.</p>
            <p>3. Who it is that takes this difference away, that breaketh down
this middle wall; and that is Chriſt the ſame who ſet it up. It was
the letting forth, that life he received, into ſeveral varieties, that
cauſed the diſtinction; and it is the drawing back of that life again
into its original, that brings all back into union.</p>
            <p>And this he doth by ſacrificing his own fleſh, (as the following
words hold forth;) by offering and giving up <hi>through the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Spirit</hi> his own life, and, in it, the life of the whole Creation
(which did flow from his life, and depended upon his life) unto him
from whom it firſt came. Hereby all <hi>Ordinances, Laws, and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,</hi>
which take hold of the Creature in its creaturely ſtate, and
follow it to death, fall to the ground; and that difference and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
which did ariſe between them from hence, fall with it alſo.
A taſte whereof was given upon ſacrificing the head, in that viſible
and demonſtrative Reconciliation between <hi>Jew and Gentile,</hi> the
foundation whereof was then made manifeſt: But the full fruits
thereof cannot be reaped, until the whole body be burnt in the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117369:7"/>
fire, by the ſame <hi>Eternal Spirit;</hi> until every member likewiſe hath
wholly returned back its life alſo; and then there will remain no
more offence in or from any part of the Creation, when there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
left them wherewith they may offend.</p>

               <p>Having aboliſhed in his fleſh the enmity, the Law of
Commandments in Ordinances,</p>
            </q>
            <p>That which nouriſheth diſtance and diviſion is <hi>Enmity.</hi> There
is an Enmity ſown throughout the whole Creation, between God
and the Creature, between one Creature and another. The life of
one creature is made fit to feed another, and there is a deſire in that
other of that food, which Nature hath made fit for it, and yet Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
alſo teacheth the other to preſerve its life and Being: Here is
<hi>the ſeed of enmity</hi> in all this thus ſecretly ſown in the nature of
things, and ſo continually ſpringing up throughout the whole Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.
There is an Enmity between the Creatures themſelves, one
Creature is an enemy to another: There is an Enmity between Man
and them; Man is an enemy to them all: There is an Enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Man and Man; one man is an enemy to another: <hi>Heaven
and Hell, Holineſs and Sin, Christ and Belial, The Temple of God
and Idols;</hi> Oh how high, how ſharp, how intenſe is the enmity
here!</p>
            <p>That which cauſeth and continueth this Enmity, is <hi>a Law of
Commandments</hi> conſiſting <hi>in Ordinances,</hi> which are appointed to
all according to their make, which are written in the nature of all,
by the contrariety whereof they come to fight and claſh one with
another. All things that are brought forth, are brought forth under
ſome Diſpenſation or other; and according to the Diſpenſation,
they are ſubjected to <hi>Ordinances</hi> of one kinde or other, ſuitable to
the ſtate wherein they are; which are written both in the ſtate it
ſelf, and in their own hearts, (though neither are very legible now,
there being <hi>a vail</hi> caſt over both; yet if man could once attain to
read here, he would finde theſe more certain and ſatisfactory books,
then thoſe he uſually applyeth himſelf unto.)</p>
            <p>What makes the Day and Night ſo fly from one another, (dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and light cannot endure to be together) but the ſeveral Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
preſcribed to each? Before which time light could lie ſtill in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117369:8"/>
the darkneſs (for <hi>the light was cauſed to ſhine out of darkneſs</hi>)
and keep company with the darkneſs, as it could not but do, before
they were ſeparated. But when <hi>God ſeparated the light from the
darkneſs,</hi> and gave to each diſtinct natures, names and ordinances,
they are henceforth debarred from any meeting together, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with each other.</p>
            <p>That which differenceth the ſeveral ſorts of men, is <hi>the light
and the darkneſs</hi> in them, and <hi>the Ordinances</hi> thereupon. Every
Diſpenſation under Heaven hath its Light and its Darkneſs. There
is a Day and a Night to man, in every ſtate, whereinto he is caſt:
And all under every Diſpenſation walk either in the light or dark
part of that Diſpenſation: And Ordinances are ſuited to every
Diſpenſation. There is the Law of Light, and the Law of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
the Law of the Night, and the Law of the Day: And theſe
are made contrary one to another hereby, ſo that they cannot meet
together in love or peace, but in their neereſt conjunction they keep
their diſtance. There is no poſſibility of communion between
Light and Darkneſs under any Diſpenſation. Indeed he that riſeth
out of a lower Diſpenſation into an higher, may comprehend both
the Light and the Darkneſs beneath himſelf, (as God comprehends
both the Light and the Darkneſs under all Diſpenſations, <hi>the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and the Light</hi> every where <hi>are both alike to him</hi>) but there
is no poſſibility of doing this in the Diſpenſation. So he that riſeth
out of one Diſpenſation into another; as he riſeth out of that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
he was in before, ſo he riſeth into a new enmity: And he
that was <hi>a Lamb, a Dove,</hi> hunted, perſecuted in a foregoing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation,
may turn <hi>a Wolf, a Lion,</hi> a greedy, cruel perſecuter, in
an enſuing. He that was <hi>all love, all ſweetneſs, meekneſs, patience,</hi>
in a former Diſpenſation, may be <hi>all wrath, fury, malice,</hi> in the
following Diſpenſation. It is now a quick time, and little will men
beleeve, what changes will be made in them, now paſſage through
Diſpenſations is become more ſwift.</p>
            <p>That which cauſed, and ſo heightened the difference between
the <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> what was it but <hi>their Ordinances?</hi>
which the more ſtrict and obſervant each were of, the greater was
their enmity, and the fight the more ſharp between them. The
<hi>Heathen</hi> cannot but look upon the <hi>Jews</hi> as diſturbers of the whole
world, as perſons who would engroſs both Holineſs and Happineſs,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:117369:8"/>
as a people who had written among them, in their Rites and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
their own acceptation and ſalvation, and the rejection and
condemnation of all others. The Jews cannot but look upon the
Gentiles, as wicked, unclean perſons, as perſons ſerving Idols at
preſent, and ſuch as could not but, in the iſſue, meet with vanity and
a lye. The very Laws, which God giveth the Jews, will not ſuffer
them to be, in any thing, like the Nations. The Laws that the
<hi>Heathen</hi> make, are likewiſe framed according to that root of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
which was in them againſt the <hi>Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now when <hi>Christ</hi> comes, he taketh upon himſelf both theſe,
and <hi>aboliſheth them both in his own fleſh:</hi> He receiveth them into
himſelf, giveth them full ſcope upon himſelf, that ſo he may termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
them in himſelf, and ſuffer them to paſs no further. He ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
no more the Ordinances of either to remain, but throweth
down <hi>the Idolatry</hi> of the one, <hi>the Worſhip</hi> of the other, cauſeth
both the Light and Darkneſs of each to paſs away by a new Light
and a new Darkneſs. Into his fleſh he receiveth theſe, and in his
fleſh he cauſeth theſe to dye, and ſetteth up ſomewhat elſe, in and
by his Spirit, which will never ſuffer them to live more.</p>
            <p>Now the end why <hi>Chriſt</hi> did this, why he did aboliſh theſe <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,</hi>
and conſequently that <hi>Enmity</hi> which flowed from them,
was,</p>
            <q>
               <hi>for to make in himſelf, of twain, one new man,</hi>
            </q>
            <p>The reaſon why he pulled down this old Diſpenſation, was, to
ſet up another. The reaſon why he pulled down both theſe old
houſes, was, to make one new one of them both. He meant to
caſt both theſe old veſſels into one new one, and therefore deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the old ſhape in them both: <hi>To make of twain, one new
man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He had two things in his eye, two intents in his heart: To make
theſe <hi>twain one,</hi> to bring this vaſt diverſity into unity; Nor
did he like either of them ſo well, as to change one into the ſhape
of the other; therefore he caſts them both over again, that he may
make them <hi>new</hi> as well as <hi>one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this fabrick he worketh <hi>in himſelf.</hi> He taketh the old build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into himſelf, the Laws and Ordinances into himſelf, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſheth
them <hi>in himſelf:</hi> He likewiſe frames the new building <hi>in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:117369:9"/>
himſelf,</hi> and brings it forth <hi>in himſelf.</hi> All things, though they
ſeem to us never ſo outward (and indeed are ſo) yet they are alſo
inward: They are <hi>within God,</hi> who is <hi>the Life and Substance</hi> of
all; and <hi>within Chriſt,</hi> who is his immediate <hi>Shadow and Image.</hi>
God and Chriſt frame every thing within themſelves, and alſo form
themſelves within every thing: And O how excellent a ſight will
it be, to ſee every thing giving up Chriſt and God who are within
them, and alſo taken into Chriſt, and into God; when the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the outward part ſhall be ſwallowed up in the perfection of
the inward part, and the perfection of the inward part ſhall break
forth and appear in the weakneſs of the outward part!</p>
            <q>
               <hi>So making peace.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>This is the way to make peace indeed, to make things one. <hi>Peace</hi>
flows from <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion:</hi> it is difference that is the root of Enmity. How
can things fall out with one another, that differ not from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
<hi>No man hateth his own fleſh:</hi> Man could not hate or afflict
the fleſh of any other, if he did indeed ſee and feel it to be his
own.</p>
            <p>Yet <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> will not make <hi>perfect peace</hi> in this old building:
Man hath the skill and ſubtilty to hate and fight with that in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which he loves and cheriſhes in himſelf. Therefore Chriſt,
that he may make ſure work, makes a new man of both; makes
an union, not <hi>in the oldneſs of the letter</hi> of any <hi>old carnal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,</hi>
but <hi>in the newneſs of the Spirit.</hi> Oh how compleat
is this union! how ſweet is the harmony that flows from it! There
is as great an harmony between them as can be in any man, for
<hi>they are made one;</hi> yea far greater, for <hi>they are made new,</hi> and
there no ingredient in this new make, that may cauſe the leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
diſſent, or diviſion; <hi>ſo making peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <bibl>Verſe 16. </bibl> And that he might reconcile both unto God in one
body by the Croſs, having ſlain the enmity in
himſelf.</q>
            <p>He had a further end in it, <hi>in breaking down the wall, in
aboliſhing theſe Ordinances,</hi> which was, <hi>that he might recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:117369:9"/>
both unto God.</hi> They were not at ſo great an enmity one
with another, as they both were at with God. The <hi>Gentiles</hi>
they were all worſhippers of <hi>Idols,</hi> but had nothing to do with
<hi>the true God:</hi> And the <hi>Jews</hi> profeſſed they could not bear his
preſence, which they evidenced ſufficiently all along, for they
loved at heart the <hi>Idols of the Gentiles,</hi> and were ſtill running
after them, but from <hi>the waters of life, which flowed from the
Sanctuary.</hi> And God could endure neither of them, but ſtill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
with terror, as an affrighter and devourer of them. Their
Ordinances ſet God at a diſtance with them both, as well as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
at a diſtance one with another.</p>
            <p>But now <hi>Christ</hi> brings them both into one, takes them both
(with all their differences) into his own body, deſtroyeth all their
differences, offers up all that God diſlikes in them (in his own
body) on the Croſs, new-makes them in himſelf, takes the enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in God towards them, and in them towards God, into him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
ſlays in them all that God diſlikes, and ſo changes and new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makes
them, that they can diſlike nothing in God any more. O
the ſweet fruit of the Croſs! What pity it is Chriſt ſhould not dye,
who maketh ſuch an harmony between the jarring Creatures, and
ſo ſweetly heals up the difference between God and the Creatures,
by his death!</p>

the <hi>experience</hi> of many, but he that wants an eye cannot read, and
he that thinks he hath an eye, cannot forbear miſ-reading. Little
did the old <hi>Iſrael</hi> think they could have been ſo deceived about the
coming of the <hi>Meſſiah:</hi> Little did they think the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> could
have layd their Laws and Ordinances ſo flat, at his coming, as he
did. It is impoſſible for that eye of wiſdom to pierce into <hi>the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
ways and appearances of God,</hi> which he greatly delights to
hide them from. Nothing is darker then the foregoing Glory, when
a new one ſucceeds. None are further from eſpying God in a new
diſcovery, then thoſe that had the cleareſt ſight of him in the old.
And there is ground in the nature of things for it, for they are
hardlieſt drawn off from the old, which they muſt neceſſarily be,
before they can be capable of entertaining the new. Look to thy
ſelf in time, leſt this ſtrange <hi>Catastrophe</hi> overtake thee unawares,
leſt thou, while thou art looking for moſt Happineſs from God, for

And this may be very vigorous in us, when it is untaken notice of

and the motions of it: But that is not the true Birth, which is or
can be taken notice of by the Childe, which is always inſenſible
when it is born, and of all its motions while it is a babe. The

are lead and taught by their nature; but yet know not, either God,

            <head>Of Sin: The Being or Existence of Sin:
The blotting out of Sin; and the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the Creatures blotting
out of Sin, and Gods blotting out of
Sin.</head>
            <p>SIn is <hi>the tranſgreſſion of a Law;</hi> which of what kinde and
nature it is, of that nature the ſin is. As the Law is more
groſs and carnal, ſo is ſin; as the Law is more inward and ſpiritual,
ſo is ſin likewiſe. It is from the Law that ſin hath its being and
force, and according to the Law which gives it its being, is its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
It would be very offenſive (to weak blinde man) to draw
the pedigree of Sin from God, who is <hi>holy and pure, who perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hates ſin,</hi> and removes every thing from him that is tainted with
it: yet for all that, God will not loſe his honor, in giving that nature
to the Law, which gave to ſin its nature.</p>
            <p>Now ſin hath the ſame reality in it, that the Law, which maketh
it, hath; or the Creature that commits it. Sin is not a nothing, but
as fully real as Holineſs, and as truly real as the Creature it ſelf. It
hath ſuch a kinde of reality and ſubſtance as other ſhadows have;
but truly ſubſtantial it is not, nor cannot be. If the Creature it
ſelf be not ſubſtance, how can any thing elſe be ſo that comes from
it; that hath what it hath, in and throught it?</p>
            <p>Sin hath its part to act in every Diſpenſation, and it is ſtill <hi>the
black engine of death,</hi> ſtaining the beauty and glory that elſe would
ſhine in every Diſpenſation. But ſin coming from the Creature by
force of a created Law, is neither Eternal in its riſe, nor in its foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and therefore cannot live to Eternity, but as it had a Being in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:117369:13"/>
time, ſo it muſt end in time. How can the ſpurious brat of the
Creature come to attain Eternal Life? No, as it came in, ſo it muſt
go out, it came in with the Law, and it muſt go out with the Law;
and as Diſpenſations change, ſo the Law changes; and when all
Diſpenſations end, all Laws end. There is a time to draw out the
line of Sin with a pencil prepared for it, and a time alſo to blot it
out again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The blotting out of Sin</hi> is the taking away the Being of
it, the ſtriking it off from the ſcore; the deſtroying of it, that it
is no more; no more what it was, no more what it ſtood for, but
is returned into the womb from whence it came, and is onely what
it was there, before it came forth. It is ſometimes expreſſed under
this phraſe of <hi>drowning in the bottom of the Sea;</hi> Sin ſhall be
drowned in the great Sea, ſo as no eye ſhall be able to diſcern it,
ſo as no Creature ſhall be able to finde it out. <hi>Iniquity may be
ſought for, but can no more be found, after it is perfectly blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a double <hi>true blotting out of Sin,</hi> which is effected,
either by ſatisfying the Law, or by breaking down the Law and
making it voyd. And this courſe God takes when he blots out ſin:
He ſatisfieth the Law for the time paſt, and breaketh it down for
the time to come, whereby all old debts are fairly abſolved, and
no new ones can poſſibly be incurred; Whereas the Creature does
it by changing its own imagination, which is of no true force and
efficacy, but onely pleaſing to the humor of the Creature.</p>
            <p>It is a great vanity (and that which now much abounds,) The
Creature thinketh, that if it imagine ſin to be no longer, that then
it is no longer: but it ſhall at length finde, though ſin be blotted
out of its minde, to its view, yet it is not blotted out of Gods
mind. Though they think him <hi>altogether ſuch an one as themſelves;
yet he will reprove them, and ſet their ſins in order before their
eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet he hath a ſeaſon himſelf alſo <hi>to blot out iniquity, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
ſin no more.</hi> And he will effect his counſel when he ſets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it, though man, in ſetting about it aforehand, fails, and makes
himſelf a greater fool then he did in ſinning. Man thinks he can do
it, and ſets himſelf very confidently about it, and makes no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
but to accompliſh it; He changeth his notion, and now all
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:117369:13"/>
is changed, ſin is gone, he doth, he can ſin no more; when, alaſs
poor Soul, ſin and all the effects of ſin (which would alſo be gone,
if ſin were gone) excepting ſuch as flow from mans imagination
concerning ſin, ſtick cloſe to him.</p>
            <p>There are multitudes of things (as we call them) which have
onely a Being in the imagination of the Creature, and many ſins
there are of that kinde: Now all ſuch things fall wholly, when they
are raſed out of the imagination of the Creature, which gave them
their Being.</p>
            <p>But beſides theſe, there are things of another nature, and ſins of
another nature, which depend not upon the Creatures imagining of
them ſo to be, but upon their own frame and conſtitution: And
ſins of this nature have as great a reality (for nature, though not in
degree) as the Law which makes them ſo, and as the creaturely
ſtate it ſelf (they being all of the ſame ſtamp and kinde) which abide
the ſame that they are made, according to the wil of him who made
them, being no whit changed in their frame and poſture, how vaſt
ſoever the changes in the apprehenſion of the Creature be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them.</p>
            <p>This World hath a real exiſtence in its kinde (though indeed, in
reſpect of inward Truth, it is not, it hath no exiſtence:) And there
is a general Law of the whole Creation, and a particular Law of
every Creature in its peculiar ſtate; And there are fulfillings, and
breakings of theſe Laws: All which are ſo in themſelves from
their own nature (and will one day be judged ſo) and do not vary
according to the imagination of the Creature, but ſtand firm ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the rule whereunto they are ſet, and whereby they are
made. And the Creature is not bound or ſet free, by its own
imagination, under any Law; but muſt anſwer for every thing it
acts in that ſtate wherein it is, according to that Law which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
to it, the force whereof it muſt feel and be ſubject unto,
what ever it conceives concerning its preſent ſtate, or freedom in it.</p>
            <p>So long as Diſpenſations laſt, Sin laſts. So far as the Creature
falls ſhort of anſwering that Diſpenſation, whereunder it is ſet, ſo
far it ſins: which ſin is not meaſured by what the Creature imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
concerning it, but by the Diſpenſation it ſelf. An high and
deep inſpection, into the inward and ſpiritual ſtate of things, may
elevate the minde of the Creature, but yet it cannot change the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:117369:14"/>
ſtate of the Creature, or lift it out of that Diſpenſation, wherein
it is, for its ſeaſon, fixed.</p>
            <p>In this outward world, and outward ſtate of things, The <hi>Day</hi>
and the <hi>Night, Summer</hi> and <hi>Winter,</hi> and all things elſe in it, have
their appointed times and ſeaſons; and are what they are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and made to be, what ever any one thinks of them. If man
imagine Summer to be Winter, Winter Summer, Day to be Night,
Night to be Day, or that both are one, or that there is neither one
nor the other; all this makes no alteration in the things themſelves,
but the natural man, with the eye of Nature, can diſcern the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
who thus dreameth, to be defective and diſtempered in his
naturals. And in the inward ſtate, things remain the ſame alſo:
<hi>Sin</hi> is the ſame, <hi>Christ</hi> the ſame, <hi>Heaven, Hell; Happineſs,
Miſery; God, Devil;</hi> all the ſame they were, and vary not as
we vary, thinking them one while to be thus, and another while
thus. The Spiritual Man may have his ſick fits, yea his fits of
Phrenzy, wherein he may imagine very ſtrongly and confidently,
yet this nothing alters the ſtate of things, but they remain the ſame
ſtill both in themſelves, and in their reference to him and others.
He is never the further from ſinning, by loſing his fight and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of ſin. Sin is of a deeper dye, then to be blotted out by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the brain. It was no mean piece of art to bring in ſin (the
Creature could never have done it of it ſelf) and it requires the
ſame skill to blot it out again, which nothing but <hi>the blood of a
living Chriſt</hi> hath the leaſt efficacy to do; and that cannot but do
it, for it contains in it both the things above mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> both
ſatisfaction to the Law, and deſtruction of the Law.</p>
            <p>Yet, for all this, I muſt confeſs I cannot but think, that <hi>Eternal
Life, Love, Power, and Wiſdom</hi> (from whom all came, to whom
all belongs, and in and for whom all is, what it is) may take pof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of whom it pleaſeth, either of a particular perſon, or one
ſort of perſons, and act them how it pleaſeth, even contrary to all
the Laws and Dipenſations that himſelf hath ſet up, and this to be
neither evil in him, nor in them. He who made the Law, may by a
power above the Law act, in any he hath made, contrary to the
Law, when he pleaſeth. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is not bound</hi> by
thoſe Laws, which he made to binde us with: Nor are we bound,
when he, by his almighty power and preſence, looſeth us.</p>

            <p>SInce this great Fabrick of <hi>Heaven and Earth</hi> hath been made
to appear, God hath ever been <hi>hiding himſelf:</hi> hiding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in his <hi>Life, Being, Motions, Operations,</hi> ſo that no eye can
ſee him, know what he does, or what he means, but that eye
which is with him, where he is. There is no <hi>life</hi> but his, there is
no <hi>power</hi> but his, there is no <hi>motion</hi> but his (as all came from him,
ſo all is and muſt be his own for ever) and yet <hi>He, his Life, his
Motions</hi> are ſo covered and kept ſo cloſe <hi>within the vail,</hi> that it is
impoſſible in any degree to diſcern them. We ſee the life of the
Creature, the motions of the Creature, the intentions of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the love or hatred of the Creature; and this we may ſee, for
it is preſented to our view: But that which is beneath theſe, that
which is within theſe, with whom or before whom theſe are not,
we cannot poſſibly ſee, until the ſcean be turned, and our eye
changed.</p>
            <p>Heaven and Earth, at their firſt coming forth, were but a vail,
behinde which God intended to hide himſelf, and did hide himſelf
even from <hi>Adam,</hi> in his higheſt and pureſt ſtate. God indeed
ſhewed himſelf to <hi>Adam,</hi> as he appeared in the Creature, as he
ſhined through the vail; but hid himſelf as he was in himſelf: ſo
that <hi>Adam</hi> could in no wiſe reach to <hi>the true Viſion,</hi> but onely to
ſuch an appearance as God pleaſed to dart forth of himſelf through
the vail.</p>
            <p>When this ſtate was broken, the vail was made thicker and
the eye of fleſh groſſer; ſo that now God hath more advantage
to hide himſelf more deeply. The eye being ſo unapt to ſee, though
there were no covering, and the covering being ſo condenſated,
that it were able to reſiſt the nimbleneſs of almoſt any piercing
eye; God may lie ſtill and act ſecurely what he pleaſeth, without
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:117369:15"/>
the leaſt jealouſie of having his myſtery diſcerned, or ſo much as
ſuſpected by fleſh.</p>
            <p>After the breaking of this eſtate, there are aſſays to reſtore it.
The whole Creature is groaning, and panting, and ſtriving after
ſomewhat it hath loſt. There is a Light let out, both to diſcover
the loſs, and to guide to the recovery. There are ſeveral Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
both to the maſs in general, and to ſome peculiar ſorts picked
out of it.</p>
            <p>Now in all theſe motions, in every Creature, under every Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation,
in all I ſay, whether direct motions or oblique motions,
is God hidden, is the myſtery of God hidden. God lies hid under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
in his ſecret ſhop: it is his Head contrives all, it is his Hand
acts all. There is nothing, either in Heaven or Earth, acts of it ſelf;
but as he moves, ſo it is moved by him.</p>
            <p>Now when God hath done his whole work, when he hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed
all that is in his heart to do, when he hath acted all that
he hath to act under board within the vail; Then he will rent the
vail from himſelf, and rent the vail from the eye of the Creature,
and preſent his own workmanſhip to his own eye in the Creature.
Then ye ſhall ſee what Diſpenſations meant, what all his motions,
(under every Diſpenſation) both on the right hand and on the left
hand, meant: Then ye ſhall acknowledg, that not one motion that
ever hath been throughout the whole Creation, could have been
ſpared in this workmanſhip, no not the moſt deformed; but as it
came equally from him with the moſt beautiful, ſo hath it its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
place and luſtre in this his intricate piece of work.</p>
            <p>But before this, the Creature muſt paſs through all Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and come to judgment; every Creature according to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
it hath been under.</p>
            <p>And O how ſtrict and exact will the Judgment be! According
as it is found guilty muſt it be dealt with, and have death propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
to its deſert meaſured out unto it; <hi>Eternal death,</hi> it ſhall
dye for ever and never live more, The ſmoak of its torment ſhall
aſcend for ever, and never be forgotten more. But <hi>the life</hi> which
was in it, which was underneath it, ſhall not dye, but break forth
and enjoy it ſelf, and rejoyce in the deſtruction of its enemy. And
though this death be not Eternal as man hath imagined it (for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
conſiſteth not in duration of time, but hath a nature proper
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:117369:15"/>
to it, whereby it is known and diſtinguiſhed: Eternal life liveth
its own life, its own eternal life, every moment,) yet it is truly
Eternal, and the pain of it unutterable and laſting. <hi>This fire ſhall
burn upon the fleſh, till it hath quite conſumed it; The worm ſhall
never dye nor leave gnawing, while there is any thing of fleſh to
be eaten up; The priſon doors ſhall not be opened, until the utmost
farthing be payd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then at laſt, when all is done, when it is wholly finiſhed,
then the meaning of all theſe things, <hi>the myſtery of God, God in
the myſtery, the myſtery in God,</hi> ſhall be opened: And then,
<hi>Eternal Joy, Everlasting Life</hi> ſhall break forth. Fleſh ſhall grieve
no more, feel no more, complain no more, when the fire hath
ſpent its whole force upon it: The Spirit ſhall ſuffer no more in
fleſh or becauſe of fleſh, when fleſh is made a meet companion for
it. When every thing in God appears, when every thing appears
as it is in God, as it came forth from God, as it was managed by
God, in that <hi>excellency, perfection, univerſal love and lovelineſs,</hi>
that greater cannot be: When every Creature ſhall ſee it was ever
tendered, even when it ſeemed moſt neglected; it was improved
to the beſt advantage, when it ſeemed moſt caſt off; it could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have wiſhed ſo well for it ſelf, as it is provided for; its <hi>Death,
Life, Miſery, Happineſs,</hi> were all acted under a vail, and were
none of them what it took them to be, but were all of them what
it was beſt for it they ſhould be:</p>
            <p>Then ſhall Glory ſhine round abound him, who is what none elſe

its freſhneſs, its beauty, its glory:</hi> but toſs and tumble it,
remove it out of one place into another, it quickly loſeth all. Emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
wine out of one veſſel into another; the taſte, the ſcent quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
changeth.</p>
            <p>And this is the common lot of the people of God, his deareſt
his ſtricteſt ones; by his continual toſſing and tumbling of them, by
his continued, ſharp, vehement exerciſes upon their ſpirits, they
come to loſe their taſte; <hi>their taste changes, their ſcent changes;</hi>
that <hi>ſweetneſs,</hi> that <hi>freſhneſs,</hi> that <hi>vigor</hi> which was once in them,
quickly waſteth and paſſeth away, after they have been a while
<hi>emptied from veſſel to veſſel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O what a ſweet taſte is there in <hi>a true Iſraelite, a lively Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite!</hi>
How lovely is <hi>the Iſrael of God</hi> when it is new-made, when
it comes newly out of the fingers of God! <hi>Moab</hi> is not worthy
to be compared to him, for taſte, for ſcent. But how ſuddenly is
this changed, by Gods emptying him from veſſel to veſſel?</p>
            <p>But now it is otherwiſe with <hi>Moab,</hi> with the more baſtardly
fort: Their <hi>excellency,</hi> their <hi>life,</hi> their <hi>beauty,</hi> their <hi>religion,</hi> their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:117369:17"/>
               <hi>lovelineſs</hi> remains ſtill the ſame. They are not thus <hi>emptied from
veſſel to veſſel,</hi> and therefore they keep that taſte and ſcent they
had.</p>
            <p>But ſhall it always be thus? No, there ſhall be a time for <hi>Moab</hi>
to be met with too. Though <hi>Judgment muſt begin at the houſe of
God,</hi> yet it will not end there, but after he hath done <hi>with Iſrael,</hi>
he will begin <hi>with Moab;</hi> after he hath done <hi>emptying Iſrael,</hi> he
will <hi>empty Moab,</hi> and then he ſhall loſe his taſte and ſcent alſo.
And then he ſhall finde, that it was not for his excellency beyond
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> that he ſcaped all this while: <hi>His Religion, his God, his
Worſhip,</hi> was not of ſo much value beyond <hi>Iſraels,</hi> becauſe he
thrived in it, and kept up the life and vigor of it, when <hi>Iſraels</hi> was
falling, and a great degree fallen: But he ſhall be aſhamed of that
God that he framed to himſelf, as well as <hi>Iſrael</hi> was of that God
they framed to themſelves.</p>
            <p>That which might carry the bell for excellency, O Chriſtians, is
fallen, is ſmitten to death. That <hi>Knowledg of God,</hi> that <hi>Life,</hi> that
<hi>Zeal,</hi> that <hi>Holineſs,</hi> which did ſparkle with luſtre and heavenly
beauty, hath not been ſpared: But that which is of a more dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
birth, doth yet live; But ſhall it live? Can God be juſt in
making <hi>Iſrael</hi> aſhamed of <hi>Bethel,</hi> and ſuffer <hi>Moab</hi> to go on pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperouſly
in worſhipping <hi>Chemoſh?</hi> No certainly, it cannot be
thus; but <hi>Moab</hi> ſhall be made <hi>aſhamed of Chemoſh, as the houſe
of Iſrael was aſhamed of Bethel their confidence.</hi>

            <p>But now ye are dead to all this. All this is gone and paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way:
ye have been ſlain to this by him who was wont to convey
life to you through it: <hi>He that built you, hath made you deſolate.</hi>
And as your frame and fabrick, was more beautiful and glorious,
then was elſewhere to be found: So proportionable have been
<hi>your ruine and deſolations from the Lord,</hi> who hath dealt ſo ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

not under any Law, and therefore cannot ſin. The Creature is

come no evil. All things, all actions are alike, there is no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;

<hi>O that ye were indeed dead! O that ye were as ſober and

take your reſt in the grave, ſtir not thence, till life quickens
you. Have no party, no intereſt, no principle, no deſire, no end:
but lie <hi>like the clay before the Potter,</hi> free to be molded any way.
But ye are very skilful; ye can tell what ye ſhall never be more,
and what ye muſt be next, what in the iſſue, and the way ye muſt
paſs to it: <hi>O depth, O height of wiſdom!</hi> here is wiſdom in its very
life and ſtrength. How ſtrangely do your hearts deceive you, to
make you think, ye are dead!</p>
            <p>I am ſure, ye had need have life, to carry you through what ye
undertake: for ye ſet about two of the greateſt works, that ever
were undertaken, <hi>viz. to pluck down, and to plant; to destroy

May not ye your ſelves ſin, and be met with for ſin, though ye can

            <p>Ye are both dead, and alive: Dead to Principles, and alive to

Your brave reſolute ſpirit, that dares trample upon <hi>Heaven and
Earth, laying your levelling line to all things,</hi> is of much value
and excellency with me; yet your creaturely coming forth in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and darkneſs, your managing this from Principles of Reaſon

my Throat cannot ſwallow, nor my Stomack digeſt. And let me
a little open my heart to you, and if in true light you finde it dark,
ſend it back to me further opened by that light.</p>
            <p>Ye hold out certain Notions and Principles, ſuch as theſe, <hi>That
God is all,</hi> that <hi>all things are good,</hi> that <hi>all things are alike, &amp;c.</hi>

               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:117369:19"/>
Underſtand ye what ye ſay? Speak ye theſe things wildly, or
comprehenſively? Can ye ſhew the ſeveral lines and gradations of
good and evil, how far they go, on whom they take place, in what
reſpect, and how long, and where, and when, and how, they come
to be ſwallowed up? Otherwiſe, though ye may ſpeak a truth;
yet from you and to you it is but a lye. In former days, and under
former Diſpenſations, ye could ſpeak truth, yet not underſtanding
it, ye found it a lye to you: Ye are gone but one ſtep further in
that which muſt paſs away as vanity, unleſs your feet be indeed fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the onely bottom, not as it appears, but as it is. Tell me,
See ye theſe things in <hi>Original Light?</hi> Not in that light, which
ſtreamed forth in you, or to you; but in that light which dwells
in the Fountain? All the ſtreamings forth of light have colours,
which cannot but deceive every eye, which ſaw them not before
they were coloured, and how they were coloured, and is not yet
able to pierce into them, or through them, while they are coloured.
Things ſo refracted, as appearing <hi>all to be good and in God,</hi> what
excellency is there in this, what certainty is there in this? Indeed
in ſome reſpect it may excel other appearances, but in other reſpects
it muſt fall beneath them. To look upon my ſelf <hi>as God</hi> by virtue
of a Notion (how ever conveyed or received) and finde my ſelf but
a Creature <hi>in life, in motion, in power,</hi> is very irkſom to a Noble
Spirit, which loves not to make a ſound above what it is or feels.
This I have felt, Power enough to batter to confound me in every
thing; but no power to build any thing, or ſo much as to fix me in
a ſtate of confuſion. But ye are differently acted: ye know, ye
underſtand things: ye have Principles to bottom upon: ye have
received the light, and life, with certainty and ſatisfaction in that
light. Well let it prove ſo; but my ſpirit is ready to ſay it cannot
prove ſo, but that all that ye have received (as yet ye have received)
muſt paſs away and prove a lye: and that ye will be as ſick of ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<hi>God is all, all is good, all is alike, &amp;c.</hi> as ever ye have been of
any of your former Notions.</p>
            <p>Shall I tell you what my ſpirit in the dark ſaith concerning theſe
things? It ſpeaketh thus:</p>
            <p>That it will be ſo one day, as ye ſay; <hi>God will be all, all good,
all alike,</hi> yet not ſo as you or I ſpeak, or can underſtand it: and
therefore though we knew theſe things, yet had we not whereof to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:117369:20"/>
boaſt, becauſe our knowledg in this kinde will vaniſh and deceive
us, as well as the knowledg of others in other kindes hath, and
muſt deceive them.</p>
            <p>My Spirit ſaith yet further:</p>
            <p>That it is ſo at preſent, to him who doth not vary, and to whom
nothing elſe can vary; and alſo to thoſe who are one with him, and
perfectly live in him. But, That it cannot be ſo to the Creature in
its creaturely ſtate, while it remains under any Diſpenſation, or
hath any Diſpenſation to paſs through. It is not the changing of
the Imagination of the Creature, that maketh any real change in
things beheld by the Creature, or in the ſtate of the Creature it
ſelf. And the preſent frame of theſe earthly moldering Tabernacles
ſeemeth to me ſuited onely to different Adminiſtrations, but quite
voyd of any capacity of entertaining and enjoying abſolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,

he had not ſeen <hi>the perfect light of God,</hi> yet he had ſeen enough to
diſcover to him the ſhallowneſs of the light of man. The time is
not yet come to judg, nor the light whereby the true ſtate of things
is to be diſcerned, and therefore a right judgment of things can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be produced: And though man will be ſo forward as to judg
aforehand by way of anticipation, yet it will ſtand for nothing
then, nor is it of any true value now. <hi>It is a very ſmall thing
with me,</hi> a thing I make as light of as may be. Though ye are <hi>a
Church of Chriſt,</hi> though ye have <hi>the gifts of the Spirit;</hi> yet if
ye will ſet about judging once, I do not regard you one ruſh; it
hath no manner of impreſſion upon my ſpirit as a matter of any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs,
as a matter worth regard: <hi>with me it is a very ſmall
thing that I ſhould be judged of you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Or of mans judgment.</hi> I do not onely ſpeak of you, but any
elſe, any other Church: I ſee how blinde and ignorant the beſt of
men are, and how unfit for any ſuch undertaking, and can ſay to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:117369:21"/>
the beſt of ye all, <hi>who art thou that judgeſt another mans ſervant?
to his own maſter he ſtandeth or falleth.</hi> I can except againſt the
perſon who judgeth, be he what he will: <hi>who art thou?</hi> Pray
how comeſt thou to be ſo exalted, as to come to judg another? art
thou his Lord? art thou Maſter; it belongs to the Lord to be
Judg: thou haſt no more right to judg <hi>thy fellow-ſervant,</hi> then he
hath to judg thee.</p>
            <p>Beſides, 'tis the day of man, and ſo but the light of man. The
<hi>Lord</hi> hath kept <hi>his own light</hi> for <hi>his own day,</hi> and ſo thou canſt
not diſcern the true nature and ſtate of things, what they are in
themſelves, what force there was from without; Thou canſt not
ſee how they lie in the heart, nor how they come forth from the
heart: all which muſt be throughly ſeen, and duly weighed, before
righteous judgment can be paſſed. Therefore the Lord knowing
how unfit man is for this work, hath forbid him it, hath bound
him up very cloſe, left him to <hi>judg nothing before the time,</hi> till
the Lord bring forth <hi>the hidden things of the heart,</hi> which is as
neceſſary to judgment as any thing elſe. And man might eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
how unfit he is to judg, in this reſpect: for there is hardly any
ſort of perſons judged by others, but this is their refuge, they run
preſently for ſhelter to the integrity of their own hearts; and
though at ſome times and in ſome caſes it be very improbable, yet
it is very hard fairly to overthrow them. Were it not therefore
better to ſtay till the <hi>appointed time,</hi> when all things ſhall be made
clear, then to be paſſing an uncertain, and conſequently an unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
judgment, and thereby to expoſe thy ſelf to judgment?
Wherein if thou ſhouldſt come off for judging aright, yet thou
wilt not come off in this reſpect, for judging afore the time: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
canſt thou be juſtified in thy judging, though thou ſhouldſt
judg aright, becauſe thou didſt it but by gheſs, and not in the clear
and univerſal light of the day.</p>
            <p>3. The Apostles modesty <hi>upon the knowledg and ſenſe of this;</hi>
yea I judg not mine own ſelf-</p>
            <p>A Man hath great advantage of judging himſelf. There is None
can look into a mans heart ſo as himſelf may. The chief conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in every action is the reference it hath to the heart. A mans
heart may juſtifie him wherein all others condemn him, and a
mans heart may condemn him wherein all others juſtifie him.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:117369:22"/>
And upon this ground a man may more ſafely judg himſelf, then he
can judg any elſe, becauſe he may obſerve the paſſages of things
from his heart, and the influence they have upon his heart better
then others can, or then he can obſerve in others.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle had greater advantage of judging himſelf then moſt
men. He had that light which gave him a true inſight into things,
and a truer inſight into his own heart, then others could attain to.</p>
            <p>Yet ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>I judg not mine own ſelf:</hi> I ſee clearly that
there is a greater a more ſearching light to judg me, then as yet I
have received, and how things will appear by that, I know not.
And therefore I value not mine own juſtification of my ſelf in any
thing. If man condemn me, I regard not that condemnation; and
if mine own heart clear me, I ſet no great eſteem on that neither.
There is another judgment which I muſt ſtand or fall by, as like wiſe
every motion within me, and every action that cometh from me:
But what others think, or what I my ſelf think in the mean time
concerning theſe things, is not much material.</p>
            <p>O how ſober doth <hi>true light, ſpiritual light, powerful light,</hi>
make the perſon in whom it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He can enjoy it, and yet not be
lifted up by it. He can uſe it, and go beyond any; in the uſe of it,
to whom it is not communicated in the ſame degree, and yet not
ſtretch it beyond its line. He can judg beyond others; more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
more truly; more certainly; and yet, in his own ſpirit, lay his
own judgment lower and flatter then others can theirs, who judg
weakly, fooliſhly, falſly.</p>
            <p>But who writes after this copy? Man, now-a-days, is as ſhort
of this ſobriety, as he is of this light. Where is the man that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not himſelf, that judgeth not others; that juſtifieth not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that condemneth not others? Look upon the <hi>Natural man,</hi>
upon the <hi>Religious man,</hi> upon <hi>the inward and ſpiritual man:</hi>
They are all able to <hi>judg,</hi> all able to <hi>juſtifie,</hi> all able to <hi>condemn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Natural man,</hi> he hath <hi>his Principles of Reaſon,</hi> whereby
he judgeth. So far as he himſelf or others walk up to them, he
juſtifieth himſelf and others; ſo far as they differ or fall ſhort; he
condemneth them. Yea he is ſo bold that he will lay this very line
to <hi>Religion</hi> and religious perſons, and condemn it, further then it
ſuits with the rule of his reaſon. But how little doth he conſider
the weakneſs, the ſhallowneſs, the uncertainty of theſe principles?
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:117369:22"/>
and therefore is not drawn to ſet ſo low a rate upon this his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as he ought to do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Religious man,</hi> he hath his light to judg by too. The <hi>Turks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
their <hi>Alcoran:</hi> The <hi>Papists,</hi> their <hi>Church;</hi> or at beſt <hi>the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
interpreted by men of their own Principles: <hi>We,</hi> the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
interpreted by men of our Principles. (Indeed we go
beyond them, in taking a further latitude to our ſelves then they
allow of; yet withall we cannot but ſee the inconveniency of that
latitude, but know not where to pitch upon an infallible remedy,
for want whereof we are often endevoring to ſet up one much like
theirs. Doth not every one almoſt ſee a neceſſity of deciding things
in difference, and thereupon deſire that the deciſion might be put
to that ſort of perſons whom they moſt affect, and judg moſt able?
And what is this but an hood winking our ſelves for quietneſs ſake,
a running in a circle into the ſame foundation of error and deceit,
for which we blame the Papiſts?) Now we all judg one another
very confidently. The Turks judg the Papiſts, and us: The Papiſts
judg the Turks, and us: We judg both Turks and Papiſts. So a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
our ſelves, There are ſeveral ſorts and Sects, different Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
about ſeveral things; <hi>Differences</hi> in points of <hi>Government
and Worſhip, Differences</hi> in matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> in matters of <hi>practiſe,</hi>
in <hi>interpretations of Scripture</hi> in reference to all theſe. What do
we all do? why, every man thinketh and judgeth himſelf in the
right, condemneth all others, making no bones of laying blame, of
laying accuſations of error and diſturbance upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The inward or ſpiritual man,</hi> he will be judging too. All things
<hi>without,</hi> he caſts by without any ſcruple; there is nothing can
ſtand before him, but <hi>the light within:</hi> And all things <hi>within</hi> or
<hi>from within,</hi> that vary from his track, that differ from <hi>his light,</hi>
from <hi>his ſenſe,</hi> from <hi>his experience,</hi> muſt come under his laſh.
And this is a great exception which hath been very ſtrong in my
ſpirit againſt all that hath appeared in this kinde; that they break
forth with a great vehemency of unbounded judging; They come
forth with a fleſhly intereſt, and for that they fight very vigorouſly
with all that ſtands in their way.</p>
            <p>Now what ſhall become of thee, <hi>O Man!</hi> Is it not high time
for thee to be taken down? Thou, who haſt ever been judging,
doſt thou think thou ſhalt never come to judgment? Thou, who
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:117369:23"/>
haſt ſtill been judging the things of God in thy day, by thy light,
without the light of God, muſt be judged for this <hi>in the day of the
Lord,</hi> and <hi>by the light of the Lord.</hi> Thou now juſtifieſt thy ſelf,
that thou keepeſt within thy bounds, thou judgeſt no further then
thou haſt ground and warrant to do: We ſhall ſee what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of this plea then.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Judg not,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. And he himſelf forbare judging (<hi>I judg
no man, Joh.</hi> 8. 15.) though if he had judged, <hi>his judgment had
been true,</hi> Verſ. 16. Yet being not his time to judg, though he was
to be Judg, he could forbear his ſentence, until the proper ſeaſon
of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Judg nothing before the time,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, until the Lord come,
who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkneſs, and
will make manifeſt the counſels of the heart.</hi> And what he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelleth
others, he practiſed himſelf: for notwitſtanding the great
advantage he had <hi>both of light and experience,</hi> yet he would not
venture to judg ſo much as <hi>himſelf,</hi> either poſitively to condemn
or juſtifie himſelf. If others accuſe him, he can wipe off their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation,
and juſtifie himſelf in reſpect of any thing they can lay to
his charge: But yet he does this as a fool, he cannot juſtifie himſelf
underſtandingly, but even in this very thing may he be foiled, when
he comes to a ſtricter tryal and judgment. And the Apoſtle, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this, though he could tell how to clear himſelf from any blame
men might faſten upon him, yet he did not value it at all, but ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
even his judgment concerning himſelf, until the time of
tryal.</p>
            <p>How wilt thou hold up thy head, O thou ſelf-juſtifier (who art
confident thou ſhalt <hi>ſtand in judgment,</hi> and art ſure that in ſuch and
ſuch particulars thou ſhalt not be caſt) and ſevere condemner of thy

            <p>THere are two great exceptions againſt Chriſt, his Miniſtry, and
Followers, a little before theſe words.</p>
            <p>1. His keeping company with the looſer ſort. <hi>Verſ. 30. The
Scribes and Phariſees murmured against his Diſciples, ſaying,

ſort.</p>
            <p>2. Their diſtance from that ſtrictneſs and exactneſs wherein o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
walked, and wherein they expected him and his to exceed,
and not to fall ſhort. <hi>Verſ. 33. Why do the Diſciples of John fast
often, and make prayers, and likewiſe the Diſciples of the Pha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,
but thine eat and drink?</hi> Men that are addicted to a kinde
of devotion and ſtrictneſs cannot reliſh any thing that comes out
of that way: Chriſt himſelf, his followers, his and their practiſes,
cannot but be judged by them, if they fall ſhort herein.</p>
            <p>Chriſt gives them an account of both theſe. <hi>Of the former, Verſ.</hi>
31, 32. <hi>They that are whole need not a Phyſician, &amp;c.</hi> Where

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:117369:24"/>
faſt, while, &amp;c.</hi> Why, ſays he, there is no poſſibility of it,
no ſuitableneſs of it to their preſent ſtate: ye cannot make them
faſt; they cannot faſt, if they would. <hi>Can ye make the children of
the Bride-chamber faſt while the Bridegroom is with them? &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The children of the Bride-chamber.</hi> In this great Bulk of the
Earth, which hath been generally caſt off ſince the Fall of Man,
there hath ſtill been ſome parcel which God hath picked out, in a
more eſpecial manner to own as his, to converſe with, and
to pleaſe himſelf in. Some he hath ſtill picked out for his <hi>Children,</hi>
for his <hi>Spouſe,</hi> for his <hi>own Lot and Inheritance.</hi> To theſe he is the
Bridegroom, they his Bride; He their God, they his People; He
the Father, they his Children, &amp;c. Thus he picked out <hi>Abraham
and his Seed:</hi> then the whole people of the Jews. Thus he picked
out the <hi>twelve Apoſtles:</hi> then the whole <hi>Spiritual Seed</hi> that
came, as it were, out of their loins.</p>
            <p>Now particular perſons in this body, they are members of the
whole. The whole together, maketh up the Society, or Church,
or Bride: The particular perſons are members, or <hi>children of the
Bride-chamber.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This phraſe, <hi>children of the Bride-chamber,</hi> notes their weak
ſtate at preſent while they are under Diſpenſations: They are not
grown up to be a Bride, they are but a Bride in ſeed, in child-hood,
under age. Though they be <hi>in the Bride-chamber,</hi> made much
of <hi>by the Bridegroom,</hi> yet this is not purely as a Spouſe, but as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
Their ſociety and ſports together are but weak and childiſh,
not grave and ſolid; like ſuch as are between the father and the
child, not like ſuch as are between the man and the wife. Their
very Nuptial pleaſure in the Bride-chamber can be but ſuitable to
their own ſtate: They can yield delight to the Bridegroom but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to what is in them, and they can receive from the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
but according to their own capacity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fast or mourn.</hi> Faſting is but an expreſſion of grief or mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
an effect that cometh from it, a companion that accompanieth
it, a means to give further ſcope to it. <hi>Grief</hi> takes away the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack
from the meat: <hi>Grief and faſting</hi> are companions: <hi>faſting</hi>
giveth vent and ſcope to <hi>grief.</hi> Therefore was faſting appointed
to the Jews, to further their mourning, that they might have full
ſcope to grieve and mourn, that they might <hi>afflict their Souls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:117369:24"/>
Now the ſeaſon of faſting is <hi>in thoſe days,</hi> when the Bridegroom
is taken from the Church, from the Spouſe, from the children of the
Bride-chamber.</p>
            <p>Obſ. 1. When God is preſent with his People in any Dispenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
communicating himſelf to them according to the nature of that
Diſpenſation, it is no proper ſeaſon of grief. <hi>There is none can
make them grieve then: They cannot grieve then, if they would.</hi>
Can ye make the children of the Bride-chamber faſt while the
Bridegroom is with them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ. All cauſe of joy is preſent, and all cauſe of grief is removed.</hi>
What is the great cauſe of joy, indeed the whole cauſe of joy in and
to the heart of the Church? why this. <hi>Enjoying of God, and pleaſing
of God.</hi> This is all that the Spouſe deſires; to enjoy her husband,
and to pleaſe her husband: and this is preſent. What ever is in God,
<hi>all his Sweetneſs, Goodneſs, Life, Power, Love, &amp;c.</hi> is let out (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the nature and degree of the Di<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> be to
him, what ever the Spouſe can deſire to be to him, what ever he

This is the ſtate of the Bride in the B<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

to her Husband, in her degree, and according to the Diſpenſation.</p>
            <p>And then, there is <hi>no matter of grief.</hi> All <hi>enemies,</hi> all <hi>accuſations,</hi>
all <hi>troubles;</hi> all <hi>fears,</hi> are damped by the preſence of her Husband.
Nay ſh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> cannot ſo much as ſtar the loſs of her Husband; for while
he is ſo near her, that ſhe can look into his heart, ſhe ſeeth that it is
impoſſible for him to part from her, further then ſhe would have
him: <hi>It is by mutual conſent that they part for a time,</hi> that they
may both dye in that preſent relation of weakneſs, wherein they
cannot enjoy one another fully according to their hearts deſire;
that they may meet again in perfection. They eſtrange themſelves
mutually from theſe weak, low, vaniſhing embraces, that they may
attain to eternal and everlaſting embraces.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſ. 2. There is a ſeaſon for the Bridegroom and his Spouſe to
part.</hi> In every Diſpenſation there is a time of enjoyment, a time
of life, a time of ſweet ſolace and delight between God and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in it; and a time of death. God hath a time to leave the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber,
and then the Bride loſeth his preſence, and all that ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
which ſhe found in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:117369:25"/>
               <hi>Reaſ. It is neceſſary that God</hi> (thus appearing, thus enjoyed)
<hi>ſhould go away:</hi> both to make way for further Diſpenſations,
(that every Diſpenſation may have his courſe,) and to put an end
to all Diſpenſations. If God did not paſs away in one Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
how could he make way for the diſcovery of himſelf in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
And if he did not cauſe all Diſpenſations to wither and dye,
how could he bring forth <hi>his own Life and Glory,</hi> which was before
all Diſpenſations, paſſes through all Diſpenſations, and can alone
diſcover it ſelf by ſwallowing up all Diſpenſations, and repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that vaſtneſs and incomprehenſibleneſs which cannot appear in
any Diſpenſation whatſoever, but muſt have its own limits to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
it ſelf in?</p>
            <p>Obſ. 3. When the Bridegroom and the Bride (or children of the
Bride-chamber) are parted, there is true cauſe of grief. Then is
the proper ſeaſon of grief: then there will be mourning and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
in the heart of the Spouſe. <hi>Such a ground of grief, meeting
with ſuch a ſubject of grief, muſt needs cauſe it to ſwell within,
and to ſpout forth abundantly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>This is the true cauſe of grief. There is no true cauſe of grief
but the loſs of God.</hi> There is no true cauſe of joy but the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God. There is nothing the heart of the Spouſe doth truly
hanker after, but God: and ſince it cannot taſte immediate enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
O how ſweet it is to enjoy him in Diſpenſations! and the loſs
of this is very bitter, which appears in this. Let the Soul loſe all
things, and enjoy its God, it hardly miſſeth any thing: Let the
Spouſe have all manner of delights and contents, and miſs God, it
can take pleaſure in nothing. Since God hath wrapped up himſelf
in his own abſolute perfection, there is nothing worth ſeeking after,
but him in a Diſpenſation: and there is nothing worth lamenting,
but the loſs of him in that Diſpenſation.</p>
            <p>2. This is the true ſubject of grief, and that in divers reſpects.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In respect of the tenderneſs of her Spirit.</hi> The more tender the
ſpirit is, the more capable is the perſon of grief. There is none ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
as the Church: None like to Chriſt for bowels, and the ſame
bowels have his Church. A little matter of grief will take great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
upon a tender ſpirit. Oh how does a little unkindneſs from
God wound and grieve his people! what will then his total depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
do?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:117369:25"/>
And <hi>in reſpect of the largeneſs of her heart.</hi> By communion
with God; by knowing, taſting and enjoying of God, ſhe comes
to have a large heart, and ſo to be more capable of joy or ſorrow.
None can bear her joys, wherewith ſhe is filled, in enjoying of God:
and none can give entrance unto ſuch wounds and ſorrows as ſhe
receives upon his departure.</p>
            <p>And laſtly <hi>in reſpect of her love.</hi> Her love was wondrous great;
<hi>her whole heart was ſet upon him; her life, her content, her very
ſoul was bound up in him.</hi> This makes a loſs very bitter; when not
onely the thing loſt was very excellent, but the whole heart of the
party was wrapped up in it.</p>
            <p>Conſider this, O ye who forget <hi>the afflictions of Joſeph! The
whole Creation groaneth</hi> and mourneth, becauſe they ſenſibly miſs
their creaturely perfection and happineſs: But <hi>the Spirit of the
Bride</hi> mourneth very bitterly, becauſe ſhe much more feeleth the
want of <hi>her Bridegroom.</hi> O how <hi>love-ſick</hi> is the poor Spouſe; her
eyes full of tears, her heart full of grief, her thoughts reſtleſs, her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
endleſs, and ſhe altogether uncapable of any comfort, while ſhe
miſſeth her beloved! <hi>O mourn with Jeruſalem ye that truly love
her: Was ever ſorrow like unto her ſorrow? Was ever destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and deſolation like unto that which hath lighted on her?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us preſs after <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> ſo far as we may. We cannot all be one
in enjoyments, one in diſpenſations; becauſe we do not all enjoy,
nor are we all caſt into one form and diſpenſation by him who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
to bring us forth in great variety: But we may be one in grief.
There are none enjoy ſo much, but that they have ſtill cauſe enough
to mourn over what they want; and if they can ſpare any grief in
reſpect of themſelves and their own condition, there are enough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
to expend it upon, which true love (where it is lively and ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathizing)
will eaſily teach them how to do.</p>
            <p>But ye, who will by no m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Go on, enjoy your pleaſure, <hi>till the Bridegroom be awakened by the
ſpirit of the Bride,</hi> which cryeth very vehemently, <hi>Come, oh come,
come; how long! when, when, oh when!</hi> and then ye will not need
to be put upon mourning, though that mourning which will then
light upon you, is likely to be more chargeable, and leſs profitable,
then that which ye are now invited to.</p>

            <head>A touch more concerning Sin, as alſo
concerning the Liberty and Perfection
of the Creature, with an Exhortatory
Cloſe to ſuch as are capable of it.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>SIn, is the deviation of the creature from that rule which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
to it, by him who made it, according to its make, nature
and ſtate wherein it is ſet.</hi> The creature is not its <hi>own original,</hi>
but was made by another; and he who made it hath given it its
<hi>nature,</hi> ſet it in its <hi>ſtation,</hi> appointed it its <hi>courſe,</hi> and its <hi>compaſs
or rule,</hi> whereby it ſhould ſteer; the deviation from which is ſin,
and layeth the creature open to his laſh, who is its <hi>King and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver,</hi>
and will call it to an account. Poor weak man doth not make
Laws for nothing, but looketh to have them boundaries, and doth
execution upon violation: and can you think <hi>the Mighty, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
Everlaſting Being, the great King,</hi> is more ſlight and trivial
then man, in the Laws he writes in the natures of all things and
perſons?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Liberty is the freedom of the creature to walk up to this rule.</hi>
It ſeeth its preſent happineſs to lie in it, and therefore cannot but
preſs towards it, which if it find no cumberance in, it may be ſaid to
be free. When it hath no inclination within, nor nothing from
without can have any power upon it to draw it aſide, but it goes
on ſweetly, vigorouſly, eaſily, according to its hearts deſire, both in
purſute and enjoyment, then it is free. While it is ſubject to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
deſires, to temptations to the contrary, it is in bondage: but
when it is ſet free from theſe, and indued with full power to walk
up to its rule, it is made <hi>free indeed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the freedom Chriſt enjoyed, (<hi>Which of you convinceth
me of ſin? There was no guile found in his mouth.</hi>) This was the
freedom Chriſt preached; This was the freedom Chriſt promiſed,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:117369:26"/>
to ſet men free from ſin. And this was the liberty the Apoſtl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
sought after, and preſſed others to: <hi>They could do nothing
against the truth, but for the truth;</hi> nothing againſt God, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for God. (I know in one ſence nothing can be done againſt
God, but in another ſence many things may be done againſt him,
and as yet are, by all under all Diſpenſations.) Not that they could
do no evil; that what ever they did was good: but the inward
inclination of their ſpirits was otherwiſe, and they had power (in
a great meaſure) to follow this inclination, and to reſiſt and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
what would ſet upon them to draw them to the contrary.
They <hi>tasting</hi> of this, in a degree, taſted of true ſpiritual Liberty,
which the greateſt freedom unto ſin, is not. If I had never ſo much
liberty within me to curſe, ſwear, drink, whore, &amp;c. (let me ſpeak
a little broadly, as is now very uſual,) for my part, I profeſs, I could
not look upon this as <hi>liberty;</hi> but as <hi>a new ſtrain of bondage,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
me unto that which there is an impreſſion in my mind and
nature againſt, and which my very ſenſe diſcovereth to me to be
contrary to the ſweetneſs and content of the creaturely ſtate. I
proteſt, for my part, I cannot deſire any ſuch freedom, nor conceive
how there can be any true delight in any ſuch goings forth, nor
ſee how they can come from, or be accompanied with true
freedom in any whatſoever tranſportations may attend them
therein.</p>
            <p>When any ſhall indeed grow into perfect union with, and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of, the fulneſs of the Godhead; then ſhall they know how to
do theſe things as God himſelf now doth them. But for the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
in its weak, dark, ſhallow, empty ſtate, to riſe up and ſay, <hi>I will
be like the moſt High,</hi> nay <hi>I am the moſt High; There is no evil
to me, nor to my eye; Darkneſs and Light are the ſame to me in
every kind, as well as to him.</hi> I muſt profeſs, this is, to my fooliſh
apprehenſion, the pureſt piece of madneſs that ever yet brake forth,
proceeding from a cup of very deeply intoxicating wine, which all
that drink of cannot chuſe but <hi>err in judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wine</hi> maketh a perſon ſtrongly conceited, maketh him forget
himſelf, his ſtate, his ſorrow, his miſery, maketh him fool-hardy, and
altogether voyd of fear in the midſt of the moſt apparant and moſt
eminent danger; but maketh no real change in his ſtate, or in other
things about him, which he judges far different from what he did
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:117369:27"/>
before, not from a true ſight of the difference, but from the ſtrength
of the wine. <hi>The fumes of the wine now abroad</hi> may make a perſon
forget ſin, its reference to him, his danger by reaſon of it, &amp;c. But
when they are expelled, and he awakened out of theſe his drunken
dreams, he will find himſelf but where he was, even <hi>in the clutches
of ſin, under the power, guilt, and condemnation of ſin,</hi> which will
not leave him, until he be more fairly quitted and delivered from it.
<hi>O God, I have waited for thy Salvation!</hi> All the turnings and
windings of the creaturely imagination cannot relieve me. A migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
power of miſery, of death, hath ſeized upon my very Soul, and
nothing but a greater power of life can prevail to reſcue me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Perfection is the creatures full enjoyment of God in and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to its creaturely ſtate:</hi> When God is married to it, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
company with it compleatly, even as abundantly as may be, in
that ſtation wherein it is ſet: when the creature hath as much of
God as it can deſire, in that very way that it is taught and led to
deſire him. Why may there not be a perfection in that very way,
in that very kind, wherein imperfection hath hitherto appeared?
And why may there not be a ſeaſon for that perfection to diſcover
it ſelf, and be ſet up, as well as there hath been for this imperfection?
There is an happineſs to come forth before our being ſwallowed up
into <hi>the fulneſs of God,</hi> which is, the letting forth of God into us in
meaſure and degree proportionable to our creaturely ſtate.</p>
            <p>Well, to draw to an end, What ſhall we ſay to the preſent ſtate
of things? Let me freely ſhoot my bolt: which is this.</p>
            <p>God hath been throwing down; But man (not able to endure a
ſtate of deſolation) hath been building up again, as faſt as he could.
God hath thrown down <hi>power with power:</hi> but man hath reared
up his new fabrick with <hi>weak, airy, empty notions.</hi> What is like to
be the iſſue? God will make good his throwing down, but mans
re-building will come to nothing. There is <hi>a worm</hi> in the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yea in all the materials; which eats out the <hi>life, heart</hi> and
<hi>ſtrength</hi> of them, and ſo maketh them quickly diſcover their own
<hi>weakneſs, creaturelineſs, and rottenneſs.</hi> Yet do not boaſt over
theſe, O Man, <hi>but conſider thy ſelf, leſt thou alſo be tempted.</hi> As
yet thou ſtandeſt; but art thou able to ſtand before that power by
which they have fallen, if it ſhould as forcibly deal with thee, as it
hath with them?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:117369:27"/>
I will conclude all with an Exhortation out of <hi>Zephaniah,</hi> chap.
2. verſ. 3. which ſhall be onely to ſuch to whom the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
direct it. The words are theſe.</p>
            <p>Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the Earth, which have
wrought his Judgment, ſeek Righteouſneſs, ſeek Meekneſs:
it may be ye ſhall be hid in the day of the Lords anger.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seek.</hi> It is a time of ſcarcity, of want, of loſs; <hi>Seek.</hi> Men
have loſt their <hi>light,</hi> their <hi>life,</hi> their <hi>excellency,</hi> their <hi>ſight and
knowledg</hi> of every ſpiritual thing: it is a very proper time for ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Let thoſe that <hi>have,</hi> make much of what they have, let them
<hi>enjoy:</hi> But let thoſe that are ſick, that want the Phyſician, that
want their ſpiritual health and ſtrength, let them <hi>ſeek.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what ſhall we ſeek? Seek what ye want: <hi>Seek the Lord.</hi>
Do not ſeek <hi>ſhadows, lyes, vanities,</hi> things that will paſs away:
But <hi>ſeek the Lord, ſeek bread, ſeek life, ſeek ſubſtance, ſeek true
riches, ſeek truth:</hi> Seek that which your ſpirits moſt naturally
gaſp after, and can onely be ſatisfied with.</p>
            <p>Who are thoſe you would have ſeek? <hi>All ye meek of the earth,
which have wrought his judgment.</hi> The meek and righteous ones,
they are onely fit to ſeek, they are the perſons God would have
ſeek him. Thoſe that are <hi>broken in their ſpirits,</hi> made <hi>tender</hi> by
their breakings; thoſe that have had ſome taſte of righteouſneſs
in their ſpirits, that have the reliſh of it ſtill on their palates, and
ſo cannot but <hi>hunger and thirst</hi> after it, theſe are fit to ſeek, theſe
God onely deſires to have ſeek him. <hi>The high, the lofty, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
ones;</hi> let them alone (ſaith God) let me deal with them:
but put the <hi>poor, tender, broken ſpirits</hi> out of the track of my indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
as much as may be.</p>
            <p>But what ſhould we ſeek in God; what ſhould we ſeek of
God? <hi>Seek righteouſneſs, ſeek meekneſs.</hi> Do not ſeek God in
his fulneſs, in his perfection; your houſe is not yet large enough to
entertain him; ye are not able ſo either to receive him, or bear his
preſence: but ſeek him in ſuch a way, in ſuch an Adminiſtration
as is ſuitable to you; <hi>ſeek righteouſneſs, ſeek meekneſs,</hi> ſeek him
to be in you a living power of righteouſneſs and meekneſs. This
is the way to be ſerviceable to God, to hold forth God, to enjoy
God in Diſpenſations, <hi>viz. to be righteous and meek.</hi> The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:117369:28"/>
and meek one, He is a kinde of God to his fellow-creatures,
He enjoyeth ſweetneſs within in himſelf, and he hath God ſtill
flowing in more and more upon him. This is that every one ſhould
ſeek in every Diſpenſation, namely <hi>righteouſneſs and meekneſs</hi> in
that Diſpenſation.</p>
            <p>But what will this avail? This is but momentany; All this muſt
paſs away. When God comes forth in his perfection, this will be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
to be but empty and creaturely, and will fall flat before
him. The fire muſt fall upon this, and burn up as well <hi>the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
and meekneſs,</hi> as the <hi>unrighteouſneſs and ruggedneſs</hi> of
the Creature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>How know you that?</hi> It may be ye ſhall be hid in the day of the
Lords anger.</p>
            <p>God is angry at the ſtate wherein things have been yet brought
forth; (I can ſay he is pleaſed with it too, yet he is alſo angry, and
truly angry. In the Creature there is but the ſhadow of anger, but
in him there is anger in ſubſtance, in truth.) He doth not like either
the deviation of the Creature, or the miſery which that deviation
leads into. He doth not like that vanity, miſery, and corruption,
which is rivetted into the Creature. He doth not like the preſent
conſtitution of the Creature, the preſent motions and actions of
the Creature according to that conſtitution. He is offended at the
whole ſtate and courſe of things; at every thing that thus is, at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing that thus is done. And he hath <hi>a day</hi> for his anger, a day
to give his anger ſcope in, a day wherein he will let the Creature
ſee and feel how angry he is with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Day.</hi> It will be <hi>night</hi> with the Creature, a very black time
to the Creature: but it will be <hi>the Lords day.</hi> He will not let out
his anger, as we commonly do, in confuſion and darkneſs; but <hi>in
cleer light,</hi> and <hi>in perfect love.</hi> As anger came from love; ſo anger
ſhall be ſubſervient unto love, and be guided and managed in and
by <hi>the light of love.</hi> Yet ſtill it ſhall be <hi>anger,</hi> it ſhall retain its
own nature, and make the Creature ſufficiently ſenſible of it, on
whom it lights.</p>
            <p>Now for all this, he hath an hiding place, wherein he can cover
what and whom he pleaſeth, in this time of indignation, from the
heat and fury of it. And this ye may meet with, if ye be led by
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:117369:28"/>
him to <hi>ſeek righteouſneſs and meekneſs,</hi> ye may be hid by him
from the ſcorching violence of it. If any thing ſcape, it is like to
be <hi>righteouſneſs and meekneſs,</hi> if any perſon ſcape, it will be he in
whom theſe are found. The indignation will be ſo hot in that day,
that the moſt righteous and meekeſt perſon breathing will hardly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd
the danger of it, but there will be ſomewhat found even in
them, for the fire to ſeize upon and torment to death: but this is
the onely way to eſcape, and perhaps by this means ye may eſcape
it. <hi>It may be ye ſhall be hid in the day of the Lords anger.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
ſhall become of righteouſneſs afterwards, yet certainly it
ſhall eſcape that brunt that is to light upon ſin: Righteouſneſs ſhall
be hid in that day of anger, and all perſons ſo far as they are found
righteous. And let men think and ſpeak what they pleaſe at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
yet they ſhall one day ſee and ſay, <hi>verily there is a reward for
the righteous,</hi> when they ſhall ſee God come to <hi>judg the earth,</hi>
and putting a difference between things and things, perſons and
perſons: For doubtleſs notwithſtanding the preſent confuſion and
diſtraction whereinto things are caſt, yet there is a time for the
orderly bringing of them forth unto judgment, where they ſhall
receive their doom; not according to what they now take them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be, but according to what they are, and ſhall by clear
light be then made appear to be. To ſhut up all.</p>
            <p>When the eyes of our ſpirits are opened in the inward and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
world, we ſhall then ſee the frame of inward and ſpiritual
things: We ſhall ſee, in the ſpiritual Creation, <hi>light and darkneſs,
good and evil;</hi> which is as real in its kinde, as that, which the eyes
of our ſenſes cannot but ſee and acknowledg in the outward world,
is in its kinde. And though <hi>darkneſs and light are both alike to
God,</hi> yet they are not ſo, nor cannot be ſo in the outward world to
the ſenſe of the Creature: Neither are they nor can they be ſo in the
inward world to the ſenſe of the ſpiritual man. 'Tis true they are
ſo to God; but neither I, nor you, nor any elſe can apprehend how
they are ſo, while we are what we are, and therefore cannot ſpeak
truth in diſcovering how they are ſo.</p>
            <p>O how hath <hi>infinite Wiſdom</hi> entangled our reaſon in its going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to underſtand and fathom theſe things, catching it in the
greateſt and ſtrongeſt bands of folly and madneſs, while it thinks it
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:117369:29"/>
hath, and gloryeth as if it had taken poſſeſſion of the deepeſt
Wiſdom!</p>
            <p>
